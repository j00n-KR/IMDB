0,MartinHafer,Intense and bloody...but well worth seeing.,8,2 November 2021,"Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) leads a very normal life. He lives in the Midwest with his wife and kids and works at a local restaurant. By all appearances, he's nothing special. However, one day two murderous sociopaths enter his restaurant and are intent not only on robbing the place but killing everyone, as this is their m.o.. Almost automatically, Tom becomes Rambo...and despite being unarmed, he manages to kill both the killers! Immediately, he's seen as a hero in the community and he makes the news. This should mean nothing bad, right? Well, perhaps not...as soon a disfigured mobster (Ed Harris) arrives in town with his 'friends', and it seems he has unfinished business with Tom....saying Tom's really someone else...an ex-mobster! Of course Tom denies it....and you aren't sure whether or not they are mistaken or if Tom has created an all new life for himself.While it probably goes without saying, this is a very violent and taut film....and not one to show small kids, your mother or Father O'Malley if he comes over for a visit. Now I am NOT saying it's a bad film or even that it's that gratuitous (though there is a LOT of blood and gore)...but I think it's important I stress to you about the violence so you know what you're getting into when you see the movie.So is it any good? Yes. It's exciting, tense and intelligently written.",A History of Violence
1,TheLittleSongbird,Hidden violence,8,21 May 2019,"David Cronenberg fascinates me, and his directing style and films are quite unique. Unique in how they really get under one's skin, explore complex and difficult themes not explored an awful lot by other directors without any sugar-coating or excessiveness and how many of them disturb and makes one feel uncomfortable. Films of his have shown some dark wit and have found myself connecting emotionally to others, primary examples being my favourites of his 'The Fly' and 'Dead Ringers'. His films are much more than horror.As is evident with 2005's 'A History of Violence', which is as long away from horror as one can get. Instead a mix of thriller and drama, which for Cronenberg back then was pretty much completely different. As were the themes, those of violence and identity, explored again two years later in 'Eastern Promises' (which there is a marginal preference for). Although the audience reaction is evidently polarising, understandably too, 'A History of Violence' was critically acclaimed at the time and in my mind while it is not perfect rightly so. It is by some way one of Cronenberg's better and more interesting later films and towards the better half of his overall filmography. Do agree with those who say that it is one of his more accessible and mature films.Not a perfect film, again from personal opinion. The first portion or so is on the slow side and doesn't draw one in straight away. Not everything felt necessary either, in particular could have done without the gratuitous staircase ""hate sex"" scene and the high school scenes which had very little tension or surprises and would have been more in place in a teenage comedy drama.Heidi Hayes is very wooden and expressionless as Sarah. Some have slammed Ashton Holmes, personally thought he fared much better as there was more intensity and emotion from him and Jack was an infinitely more interesting character, at least the film actually tried to develop him whereas Sarah was more the stereotypical young daughter that contributes little to the story.On the other hand, 'A History of Violence' as usual for Cronenberg looks great. The locations create a sense of foreboding as does the very atmospheric lighting and tight editing. In this regard though, the star is Cronenberg regular Peter Suschitzky's cinematography, which has the right amount of grimy grit and audaciousness. While there is a preference for more characters-of-their-own scores 'The Fly', 'Dead Ringers' and 'Eastern Promises' of his collaborations with Cronenberg, Howard Shore's score is still suitably dramatic and hauntingly ominous with no questionable placements. Cronenberg provides some of the most ambitious and tightest directing of all his later films, doing a great job pulling no punches and keeping the tension going, keeping it remarkably and uncharacteristically straight.Some have criticised the script, personally found it thought-provoking, taut when needed, darkly satiric in places and subversively witty in others, failing only in the high school scenes. The story on the most part did grip me with its teasing tension and suspense in the atmosphere, loved the tension between Viggo Mortensen and Maria Bello, the unflinching and pretty frightening violence that really doesn't hold back and the unforgettable climax. Mortensen gives one of his best performances in one of his meatier roles and Bello brings a lot of heart to hers. Ed Harris chills the bone and to me he was more deserving of the Best Supporting Actor nomination than the still very good William Hurt who really livens proceedings up in his ruthlessly ripe turn.In summary, a very good film. 8/10",A History of Violence
2,Leofwine_draca,A well-handled and surprisingly mature thriller from former maverick Cronenberg,9,30 July 2016,"David Cronenberg's film is a visceral look at the effects of violence on normal, everyday family life; charting how it ripples out from a single act of violence until it becomes all encompassing and prevalent. Typically for a Cronenberg film, it doesn't shy from the scenes that other movie makers avoid; here we get some violent shootings and explicit sex scenes, but it's nothing compared to some of the director's earlier fare like THE FLY. Instead, A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE is a surprisingly subtle, well-acted thriller that builds the suspense scene by scene, has many interesting and surprising plot twists, and keeps you engaged throughout.Viggo Mortensen fits the small-town hero role like a glove, and handles his part with aplomb; he's especially good when handling more complicated scenes later on in the movie. Some great actors ably support him, although Maria Bello, as his wife, fails to make her character the remotest bit likable. Instead, the actor playing Viggo's son is superb, Ed Harris excels as a scarred gangster, and William Hurt turns up right at the end in a creepy showdown.Cronenberg's direction is as assured as ever, although his customary coldness is apparent in one or two repellent moments. The various acts of violence are handled very well and are surprisingly restrained given the director's pedigree, but this doesn't detract from their impact. All in all this is a very well-handled thriller that has a number of interesting, compelling themes, including identity, doing what is right, and, surprise, surprise, violence. Cronenberg's maturest work yet.",A History of Violence
3,SnoopyStyle,Violence more meaningful than the usual cartoon fare,8,6 January 2014,"Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) works at a diner in a small town. His wife (Maria Bello) loves him. His son (Ashton Holmes) is getting bullied at school. One night, two killers come into the diner. Tom fights back and kills the two criminals. He becomes an instant hero. However his face is all over the news, and people from his dark past come looking for him.Director David Cronenberg has strip down the grotesque cartoon violence. In the process, he has made the violence more powerful and more meaningful. Violence becomes like an infection as it spreads in the family. Is it better that the son avoid a confrontation with his bully or beat the crap out of him? This and other questions are left unanswered. In a sense, he's left it on the kitchen table for the family to come to terms with as the film goes to black.",A History of Violence
4,claudio_carvalho,Violence in Chain Reaction,10,2 September 2006,"In Millowbrook, Indiana, the mild Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) owns a bar and has a calm life with his beloved wife Edie Stall (Maria Bello), his teenager son Jack (Ashton Holmes) and his little daughter Sarah (Heidi Hayes). His life turns upside-down when her kills two cold blood killers in his bar to protect his waitress, becoming a local hero and being showed in the front page of the news and on TV. The mobster Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris) comes to the town calling him Joey Cusack and telling that he was a former hit man. When Carl and his men threaten his family, Tom defends them, and violence is released in a chain reaction.When I decided to see this movie, I advised my wife that probably it would have weird and bizarre scenes, based on the style of David Cronemberg. I was completely wrong, and this film is actually one of the best action movies I have seen for a long time. The characters are very well developed in a low but adequate pace, with a quite idyllic beginning. They are full of emotions and feelings, overreacting and reacting like human beings and not those caricatures that we usually see in movies. The action scenes are very realistic, and the sex is very intense, with one of the most impressive scenes I have ever seen. The conclusion makes this movie a masterpiece, with Tom returning home and slightly being accepted back to the breast of his family. On the contrary of most of the films, Tom's return and acceptance and forgiveness by his family may take a long time or never happen, since deep wounds were open. The number of nominations of this movie shows how good and recommended it is. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Marcas da Violência"" (""Marks of the Violence"")",A History of Violence
5,kosmasp,History Lessons,10,12 July 2007,"David Cronenberg is a masterful director. As he shows us again, in this thriller masterpiece. And what really makes it great, is that he doesn't rely on themes he relished on in the past (see Videodrome or even Existenz, which are more metaphysical), this is straight-forward! With a Cronenberg-touch of course! The actors are really great, but it all starts with a great shot at the beginning. One of the best/suspenseful things to grace your screen! And it shows that little can be much. There's not much camera-movement involved here (and no cutting, too), but it works really great. The pacing is relatively slow, but that does work for the movie! One thing is for sure, this won't be for the easily offended (see rating details for extra information on that)!",A History of Violence
6,classicsoncall,"""You been this other guy almost as long as you been yourself.""",8,20 October 2005,"""A History of Violence"" isn't an easy film to watch, and without a major suspension of belief, is even harder to accept. Nevertheless, the film delivers at a gut level, and allows the viewer to empathize with a mild mannered middle class family man pushed to the limits of psychological endurance. Viggo Mortensen's character, Tom Stall, finds himself at the center stage of controversy and media attention when he defends his diner and it's employees from two thugs who mean bodily harm. The first tip off that there's something more to Tom's past than we've come to know at this point is the cool detachment and self assured manner in which he dispatches the men. This was not luck, or an act ""anyone else would have done""; it was stone cold and brutal.One gets the feeling that Tom Stall is almost too much in control, his manner and speech is so measured that he almost comes across as an automaton. But he's mastered the deception that hides a violent past, as brother to an organized crime boss back East. The act has even his wife and family fooled, wife Edie (Maria Bello) so loyal as to virtually take on Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris) at the local mall when the mobster takes note of Joey Cusack's heroics, Joey being Tom Stall's alter ego. Admittedly, Stall has even the viewer guessing for a long time into the film, is this a case of mistaken identity, or is there something to the story of a man capable of ripping open a face using barb wire? Once at the diner may have been a fluke, but the carnage that takes place in the Stall's front yard brings the family's nightmare to a new level. Could it be that Quentin Tarantino had it wrong, that Tom Stall is a natural born killer. Dazed, appalled, confused, the marriage of Tom and Edie is pushed to the breaking point, but not before Tom's rage explodes into sexual furor in a scene that makes one as uncomfortable as any of the movie's gun play. Spontaneous and bewildering at the same time, if the scene is meant to disorient the viewer, it works admirably.The real Joey Cusack emerges following a half cross country trip to Philadelphia; Joey gets a late night call from made man brother Richie (William Hurt), who's on the carpet for his brother's indiscretions - he's taken out some seriously connected mobsters. This time out though, back in his element, Tom/Joey's steely resolve and martial training leaves a trail of bodies inside his brother's home - quick, ruthless, like an automaton.The film's ending offers a myriad of off screen resolutions. Will Tom reconcile with his family, can he ever regain Edie's trust, can son Jack ever be normal after rifling a mobster in the back to protect his father, and on and on. And oh yes, does Tom make headlines as the killer out of the closet once the authorities track him to his Midwest home? Or will it be another faction of the mob that comes calling to remind Tom of his own bloody mortality? Because if you buy the story of a man driven to violence because of a chance encounter at a Midwestern Indiana diner, you've also got to believe that justice will come calling when the dust and your own churning gut settle.",A History of Violence
7,gavin6942,A New Cronenberg With the Same Great Taste,8,15 May 2006,"Based on a graphic novel... a man named Tom (Viggo Mortensen) with a diner gets robbed, but becomes a hero when he executes the robbers before they can escape. Then the mafia (including a man played by Ed Harris) comes to town.Opening with a single shot of four minutes, Cronenberg is in full force here. His commentary makes clear that he has fine tuned every little detail, from this extended take, to the colors of the baseball teams' jerseys (with the yellow baseball team weaker than the blue, using the subtlety of ""yellow"" as ""chicken""). Very, very mature directing.This film is great with its parallel tales of father and son and how they confront violence. When is it right, when is it wrong? Is it ever right? The scene where the main character uses a Judge Reinhold move to stop the robbery is classic. The violence is intense but fits perfectly in this film and has director David Cronenberg's signature all over it.After the twist, the dynamic of the family changes and a whole new tale begins. This one is just as interesting as the first one, if not better. Forgive my vagueness.As I said, the violence is very Cronenberg... some similar makeup as we have seen in ""The Brood"" and to a lesser degree ""Rabid"". He must either do the makeup himself or keep the same guy because it is the most recognizable aspect of his work in this film.The best critique comes from Steven Shaviro, who goes in a great deal of depth. He points out that unlike past Cronenberg films, ""the film is not psychological, not about interiority"", but instead ""impersonal or transpersonal."" And, indeed, this is true: unlike the psychological conflicts of past heroes, here the hero is empty... a blank slate to be written upon. ""As Tom, Mortensen is simply too blank to 'identify' with"".Shaviro points out that while there are two parts of this story, they are really continuous and interwoven: ""A History of Violence is like a Moebius strip. At any given point, it seems to have two sides; but the two sides are really the same side, each is continuous with the other, and slides imperceptibly into the other."" The one side is not whole without the other because it is, in fact, itself.As far as this double-level goes, David Lynch's ""Mulholland Drive"" has a duality much like ""A History of Violence"", but where the directors take them is very different. ""Lynch marks the two sides in the form of manic camp on the one hand and depressive bitterness and paranoia on the other, Cronenberg flattens both of them out, empties them both out. Lynch is thus a maximalist, Cronenberg a minimalist"".Cronenberg's darkness, a theme he has perfected over thirty years, comes out very artistically: ""everything is literally as it is supposed to be, but some dimension of warmth (or smarminess) is unaccountably missing, and this makes it all rather creepy."" ""Cronenberg can be so unrelentingly grim, instead of having to resort to camp, in the ways that David Lynch and Guy Maddin both do"".Anyway, if you like a good mafia tale with Viggo Mortensen, Ed Harris and William Hurt... this is the film you want. And did I mention the gratuitous sex scenes and shaved man-butt? Because they're in there, too.",A History of Violence
8,lee_eisenberg,violence...some people have to play that game,10,12 June 2006,"We all know that David Cronenberg's movies are usually very gruesome. Even knowing that will not prepare you for ""A History of Violence"". The movie begins with a very long shot of two thugs deciding where to drive. Then, we meet respected restaurant employee Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) in Millbrook, Indiana. He has a self-standing, gorgeous wife named Edie (Maria Bello) and two children. In short, Tom is clearly the epitome of the hard-working, all-American family man.Then, the two thugs come to the restaurant and try to rob the place. Tom manages to kill both with barely any effort. Since everyone in the restaurant identifies what happened - specifically that Tom's actions were justified - this makes Tom a hero; a local celebrity, if you will. Then, a man named Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris) comes to the restaurant and starts calling Tom ""Joey"", claiming to know him. While Tom tells Carl to leave, Carl then shows up in the mall while Edie is shopping. Finally, there's a big scene in Tom's front yard. Ah, but that's not the end. You see, what happens there shatters everyone's impressions. And it's up to Tom to set everything straight.Above all, this movie has David Cronenberg written all over it. Not just because of the grotesque images, but because of how he plays with the audience. He does a very mind-blowing job upsetting a ""wholesome small town"", just like Alfred Hitchcock did in ""Shadow of a Doubt"". A really interesting device is how in the yard scene, the son appears to be developing the father's persona. Will this movie make you question everything that you've ever believed? Maybe, maybe not. But either way, it's not a movie that you're likely to forget anytime soon, and I definitely recommend it. Also starring William Hurt.",A History of Violence
9,jboothmillard,A History of Violence,7,20 April 2007,"When I found out this film was from cult director David Cronenberg (Videodrome, The Fly, Crash), I was expecting a more disturbing film, like his others are. Basically Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen, two years after Lord of the Rings) is a normal owner of a local diner with a wife, Edie (Golden Globe nominated Maria Bello) and his kids, a young daughter and quite nervy teenage son, Jack (Ashton Holmes). One day two men come into the diner, and threaten all in the room, but Tom prevents the holdup and kills both men (one taking of his nose, the other shot). After a few appearances on the news, a disfigured thug, Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris) is convinced he knows him, he is calling him Joey Cusack. Over a few days Tom and his wife insist to Carl he is not this ""Joey"", but it is when Jack is threatened that the truth is revealed. Unfortunately it is after this truth and killing Carl that (the critics say this too) film slightly sags. All that happens after this is Edie hates him, they have unexpected sex on the stairs, and Tom goes to the men he used to hang out with before he ""killed"" Joey, including his brother Richie Cusack (Oscar nominated William Hurt). Filled with some great moments of gory violence, this is quite a tense thriller based on a graphic novel. Also starring Peter MacNeill as Sheriff Sam Carney. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, it was nominated the Cannes Film Festival Golden Palm Award for Cronenberg, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Very good!",A History of Violence
10,ccthemovieman-1,The Good & Bad Of 'A History Of Violence',8,7 January 2007,"This was a very intriguing movie, for the most part. It had some things that really turned me off, but also things that made it extremely interesting at times.There is excellent suspense in this movie which builds beautifully. It begins with a nice, soft- spoken modest guy named ""Tom Stall"" (Viggo Mortensen), a guy who runs a café in a small Indiana town. He suddenly becomes a hero when a pair of serial killers enter his establishment, threaten to rape the waitress and possibly kill the rest of the people inside and Tom disposes of them with quick action. He gets national attention for his heroics, but that just brings in a couple of mysterious people into town. One of them, ""Carl Fogarty,"" (Ed Harris) calls ""Tom"" by another name: ""Joey."" That's our first glimpse that ""Tom"" may not be ""Tom,"" but some guy named ""Joey"" from Philadelphia who used to have mob connections. That turns out to be true. In fact, ""Joey"" was a brutal killer in his past days. I won't divulge any more of the story for those who haven't seen it. It's simply a good story about how our past can come back to haunt us, especially if their is anything illegal or immoral in it.I liked the fact that the action, although violent at times, was not overdone. Most of the movie is pretty low-key.What I didn't care for, or thought stretched credibility, was our hero's wife, who was way too big-city-hard looking and profane to be some small-town country girl who would marry such a nice guy as ""Tom."" Maria Bello (""Edie"") did not fit what this character should have looked and sounded like. Also, Tom's son ""Jack"" morphed from a nice old-fashioned, meek, picked-on school kid to a sullen, wise-guy, profane macho man in no time. That was unrealistic, unless they were trying to infer the kid was exactly like his old man. Speaking of profanity, 14 uses of the Lord's name in vain in less than 80 minutes was offensive, at least to me.William Hurt gets third billing in the film but only shows up with 14 minutes left! Granted, his role is a memorable one, however. Harris also had few lines for someone who gets good billing. Another guy I thought was pretty cool was the sheriff, played by Peter MacNeill. He had bigger roles than Harris or Hurt but got no billing.Overall, offensive material notwithstanding, this was a unique film and one I would would watch again.",A History of Violence
11,rmax304823,The Stalls Identity.,6,14 October 2006,"I was interrupted after about two-thirds of the movie and could only listen to the last part, but the film seemed interesting enough to warrant a few notes.First of all, for Cronenberg, this is a linear narrative. Basically, Tom Stalls (Vigo Mortensen) is an ex-hood who has begun a new life as the owner of a small café in Indiana. He becomes a hero by overcoming two really nasty armed robbers, his face appears in the news, and his former associates in Philadelphia seek him out to settle a few old scores. The associates include Ed Harris and William Hurt in relatively small roles.Cronenberg invests the story with none of his usual grotesqueries. That is to say, nobody rots on screen. Nobody's head explodes. Nobody has a sexual thing for overripe pumpkins or anything.The first half hour is finely done. Ordinary people doing ordinary things, until Mortensen unexpectedly does something quite extraordinary. There is a subplot involving his teen aged son who goes through something of the same personal revolution regarding the bullies at his high school. Nice picture of peaceful, rather dull small-town life at first.But when Stall's true identity becomes apparent, the story weakens and turns into a more nearly traditional action/crime flick. And it becomes less believable. When Mortensen's wife finds out who he has been she runs to the bathroom and vomits. The incident makes the point dramatically, but would it really happen? She's lived with this peace-loving gentle, caring guy now for years but in a few seconds the love is turned to revulsion.There's another angry exchange later that ends with an animal-like coupling on a staircase. Both Mortensen and his wife (Maria Bello) turn from fury into lust in the blink of an eye. Would you want to make love to someone who has just cursed you and slapped your face? Well, maybe you would. The vagaries of your erotic life are certainly none of MY business. Personally I would prefer to be the slapper than the slappee, but only if it were consensual and deeply caring.Where was I? Oh, yes. And Mortensen's kid. When the boy finds out his father has a ""history of violence"" he too gets irritated -- whining and demeaning his Dad. But, again, why? It has been estimated that every cell in the human body dies and is replaced every seven years. Don't we ALL deserve another chance? Especially when, as in this instance, it is never clear exactly what Mortensen ever did that was so damned bad? I kind of like Vigo Mortensen. He's handsome without being conspicuously so. And his acting style is minimalist, kind of like Robert Redford or Gary Cooper. He never really does very much with his face, but as in the Kuleshov studies his feelings are suggested by their context. He may not look disappointed, but we know he must be disappointed because these are disappointing circumstances.Ed Harris is great, with his hideous scar from the barbed wire. He uses a ripe Tenafly, New Jersey, accent in the part. Sounds great. He's turning into a very good supporting player. And William Hurt is interesting, as he invariably is.",A History of Violence
12,Tweekums,A Case Of Mistaken Identity?,9,11 December 2008,"I'd heard good things about this film so when it was on television this week I thought I'd give it a go. While it wasn't quite what I was expecting it was very good. Viggo Mortensen was particularly good as Tom Stall the owner of a diner in a small American town who's life is changed when a couple of murderous thieves come in one day. His actions in overpowering and killing these two make him the local hero, a role he isn't all that keen on.Not long afterwards a mobster and his sidekicks turn up convinced that Tom is in fact Joey from Philadelphia, Tom professes to have no idea what they are talking about and tells them that they must have mistaken him for Joey. The mobsters don't believe him and challenge his wife to ask him just how the manager of a diner would know how to disarm and kill two armed thugs. In a parallel story his son is being bullied at school by a group of sportier kids, when they push him to far it is clear that he too has a capacity for violence when he hospitalises his main antagonist. As the film progresses the tension mounts, the violence escalates and Tom's friends and family begin to wonder if there is something in his past that he hasn't told them.As well as Viggo Mortensen's fine acting there are great performances from Ed Harris as the mobster and Maria Bello as Tom's wife. I'd certainly recommend this film, I've tried to keep the spoilers to a minimum as it is best going into this film not knowing too much.",A History of Violence
13,BA_Harrison,"Not classic Cronenberg, but still worth a watch.",7,2 November 2007,"I was raised on the body-shock horror of David Cronenberg's earlier films (Shivers, Rabid, Scanners), and grew to love the weird, twisted, and often very bloody imagery that typified his 70s and 80s cinema. But for the last decade or so, his output has appealed to me less and less, with efforts such as Spider, M. Butterfly, and Crashmovies that appear to be more art-house than horrorfailing to pique my interest.However, on the strength of some very positive reviews, and an intriguing trailer, I decided to give this one a go, to see if the film could reignite my interest in the Canadian auteur's career.A violent (natch!) tale of revenge and redemption, A History Of Violence sees Viggo Mortensen as Tom Stall, a small-town family man who becomes a media sensation after he foils a violent robbery in his diner (by disarming the criminals and killing them both!).Unfortunately, Tom's sudden fame brings him to the attention of a gangster and his cronies, who believe that the reluctant hero is actually a fellow criminal who has gone into hiding after upsetting his peers. The bad guys show up in Tom's town and begin to cause trouble for him and his family.Whilst I wouldn't exactly say that I have seen the light, and returned to the fold, happy once more to worship at the altar of Cronenberg, I will admit to enjoying A History Of Violence. But perhaps not on the level that the director might have been hoping for.As Tom's perfect world starts to fall apart, we witness the impact that this has on all members of his family, and see how their relationships evolve. I believe Cronenberg's intention was for his audience to think long and hard on the subject of morality (was Mortensen's character good or bad and did he deserve a second chance at happiness), and how not being honest with those that you love can result in tragedy.Unfortunately, I wasn't completely sold on the deep and meaningful stuff; it seemed a little forced to me. But I did find the film tense and disturbing, enjoying the mystery as it unfolded, and I also appreciated the many nasty scenes in which Viggo gets brutal on the baddies, snapping their necks, shooting them at close range, crushing larynxes, and even punching one guy's nose-bone into his cranium. There's also quite a bit of frenetic sex in the film for all of the pervs amongst us, including impromptu rutting on the stairs and a 69 (between Tom and his tasty wife, played by Maria Bello, who kindly flashes her beaver).A History Of Violence isn't classic Cronenberg, but it has made me interested enough to want to see what his next film can offer me in the way of sex and violence.",A History of Violence
14,moonspinner55,"Tough, flashy, surprising character piece studded with bloody violence...",6,5 June 2016,"Viggo Mortensen displays a wonderfully natural combination of innocence, pain and confusion playing the proprietor of a small town diner who says he's been mistaken by mobsters out of Philadelphia for being a killer living under an assumed identity. David Cronenberg directs this intense drama with a sure hand, though the plot, loosely adapted from a graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke, grows steadily more outrageous as it nears its conclusion. Still, Josh Olson's Oscar-nominated screenplay holds several surprises and interesting characters, though his usage of 'faggot' as a put-down is mighty old (can't we call a moratorium on this ancient schoolyard insult?). Handsomely-produced and nicely acted throughout, with William Hurt also Oscar-nominated in a small but pivotal role. **1/2 from ****",A History of Violence
15,Quinoa1984,a tale of a skeleton coming out of a closet...a dark one,10,30 September 2005,"David Cronenberg is a director I haven't delved into enough yet, but from what I have seen from the 90's (Crash and Existenz) he is one of only several out-of-the-box ('mainstream' box that is) to be successful with his films. A History of Violence is no exception, and is an excellent film, the kind that I almost was a little surprised was playing at my town's cineplex. Perhaps the sort of star power behind it helped; Viggo Mortensen coming off of Lord of the Rings with a healthy career, as well as good actors like Maria Bello, Ed Harris, and William Hurt. It's also surprising because of how frank the subject matter is. At first I wondered (i.e first fifteen minutes) how this could be based off a graphic novel. By the end I understood that Cronenberg saw how the nature of the material worked best by being completely straightforward, so that what lies beneath with the protagonist comes like a ton of bricks.The film is also appealing for one because it is more about character than story (as Ebert also pointed out), and will either suck you in by that or leave you dry. The story, like Cronenberg's camera, doesn't pull punches either, it's just what it is; Mortensen plays Tom Stahl, a local in a small town running a diner, who becomes a local hero when he somehow stops (in the harshest sense) a couple of robbers and killers (they also appear in the first scene of the film, making a point perhaps about how violence is, of course, a very horrible thing). Harris, (believably) a secretive gangster, comes into town with an eye to show for something in the past. This then brings out the skeleton, in the form of another man in Tom's past- his real self.Again, in lesser hands this could become an adaptation that would reek of mis-characterization, of making the characters with less dimension, perhaps even showing Tom/Joey more like a comic book character than a real man. One key asset to the film is Bello as the wife, who serves as the emotional anchor in many scenes. How does one react when violence is spread amidst the family (there is an intriguing sub-plot with the teenage son, who faces up to a bully at school)? An early scene, where Bello and Mortensen have a night to themselves, is amusing and playful, but also sets up the relationship that has to follow through in the film. In a way I almost wish the film had been a little longer (some good films aren't long enough sometimes), but it's also a very concise, tight way of doing a third act the way Cronenberg does; when we meet these bad people, they are BAD people just as there are the good, decent people of the town in the film.It's indeed a layered film, one that has a mysterious element to it, and raises questions more about how people deal with violence in the psychological, moral, and even spiritual sense (though there isn't a drop of Christianity or other in the film, thank God). It's not an easy film, and there is a great ending that doesn't let the viewer completely off the hook either.",A History of Violence

Fogarty begins stalking Tom's wife (Maria Bello) and children"" according to the DVD sleeve description.It's better to see this film before reading the commentaries, which are bound to hint at the main character's duplicity; and, seeing the story cold allows director David Cronenberg and Mr. Mortensen to unfold an important characterization with some mystery. ""A History of Violence"" is much less gruesome than the ""for mature readers"" graphic novel (comic book) written by John Wagner. The lead ""villain"" is very different; altering characters, to add a brotherly relationship, doesn't work (for me).Since they play up the genetic ""History of Violence"" through son Ashton Holmes (as Jack Stall), it might have been better to make Mr. Hurt's character a father/grandfather. The staircase semi-rape scene is a misstep, especially since it comes with a beautifully done ""role-playing"" sex scene involving Ms. Bello pretending to be a cheerleader; at least, with the more violent sex act, you can understand what Cronenberg is aiming for - the personality change - but, it works better when Mortensen smacks his son.The ""bully"" sub-plot involving Mr. Holmes and Kyle Schmid (as Bobby) is another nicely intended and acted addendum that still manages to seem out-of-place. In fact, the whole picture is nicely performed, beginning with the bang-up opening shots delivered by Stephen McHattie (as Leland) and Greg Bryk (as Billy). Cronenberg is expertly assisted by his crew, including regular cinematographer Peter Suschitzky and editor Ronald Sanders.The ""Academy Awards"" chose to honor the picture with a ""Supporting Actor"" nomination for Hurt, who occupies (but dominates) the screen for a relatively small time. Considering the crowded field of worthy male performances in the film, it would be have been nice to see actress Bello among the Oscar nominees; she works marvels in the singularly crucial female role.******* A History of Violence (5/16/05) David Cronenberg ~ Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello, Ashton Holmes, William Hurt",A History of Violence
18,Coventry,"Mainstream or not, David Cronenberg stands a class above the rest.",8,7 November 2005,"According to some self-acclaimed cinema experts, David Cronenberg, who has made ultimately bizarre and very personal movies for about 30 years, has now all of a sudden gone ""mainstream"" with this overall accessible and logically structured thriller. Well yes, maybe ""A History of Violence"" is 'normal'-looking compared with other, typical Cronenberg highlights such as ""Videodrome"" or ""Dead Ringers"", but his obsession for the darker side of the human mind is still there and his world perspective is still very twisted and merciless. The film starts with one of the greatest opening sequences of 2005 and immediately sets a grim and violent tone that'll only grows more intense as the story develops. The peaceful setting of Millbrook  Indiana, where the entire movie is set, excellently illustrates the contrast of the message Cronenberg brings, namely that man is basically a violent creature. The success of this film entirely revolves on its disturbing undertones, as the actual story is nowhere near innovating or difficult to follow. Instead of bringing staggering new material, our brilliant director sadistically prefers to mock America's obsession with armory and sensational media news. The acting performances of the entire cast are sublime! Viggo Mortensen often succeeds in looking scary (can't really explain how he does that, though) and especially Ed Harris' evil charisma comes across as very, VERY threatening. I like to believe that ""A History of Violence"" isn't ALL about brutal murders, but it's true that the violence is explicitly portrayed and definitely the most memorable aspect of the entire film. Extreme violence and graphic sexual contentisn't that what makes the world turn 'round?",A History of Violence

20,hitchcockthelegend,"Straw Dogs comparisons be damned, this is a riveting experience that finds Cronenberg bringing his ""A"" game.",9,17 November 2008,"We are in a a small community driven town, restaurant owner Tom Stall becomes the hero of the town when he shoots and kills two murdering robbers at the restaurant. Not long after, facially scarred Carl Fogarty arrives in town proclaiming that Tom is actually a former gangster from Philadelphia who needs to go back to pay his dues. As Fogarty and his Hench Men put the pressure on, Stall and his family are in danger of being overwhelmed with violence and mistrust. One thing that can never be said about David Cronenberg is that he is a very predictable director, his output of course, if we are all honest, is very up and down, bewildering critics and fans in equal measure. Thankfully A History Of Violence finds Cronenberg on particularly devilish form, taking the graphic novel origins of the piece, written by John Wagner & Vince Locke, and crafting a modern day Western that is using violence as some sort of escalating disease. This is the point surely? The graphic violence (handled with morose tension by Cronenberg) is the main character in the film, regardless of any past history that Stall may have had, the violence arrives into this family, totally unwanted and unexpected, and then latches on to them to maybe destroy them? With that point of interest to note, A History Of Violence can be seen as a blood brother to Cronenberg's wonderful remake of The Fly, the unwanted entering the fray and spreading its disease to the point of no return. There is the use of the husband and wife's ongoing sex life as a seriously smart strand in the escalating story, where once at the beginning there is fluffy erotic intercourse, then the on going danger in their lives brings darkness and borderline sadism, it's very relevant, as is the son axis as he goes through a dramatic change when the violence and threats engulf the family. Cronenberg gleefully ties all the murky threads together to ask us for a reaction to the violence up there on the screen. The cast, with the exception of a fish out of water performance from Ashton Holmes as the son, Jack, is fine. Viggo Motensen plays the duality of the role as Tom Stall with much verve, while Maria Bello shows exactly why she shouldn't be working for food in hopeless miscast assignments like The Mummy 3. Ed Harris gives us a nice line in villain duties, and William Hurt crops up late in the piece to almost steal the film with his darkly disturbing menacing point of worth. Peter Suschitzky's photography enhances the primary colours for added impact when the mood swings down dark roads, and Howard Shore's musical score is constantly ominous, where he blends his own score for Silence of the Lambs with a sort of Berlioz like edginess. All in all it's a very interesting and sneakily crafty picture that above all else shows that when on form, Cronenberg still has very much to offer modern age cinema. Now, about Straw Dogs? 8.5/10",A History of Violence
21,Theo Robertson,A Film Of Three Acts,7,11 April 2013,"I came in to this film knowing absolutely nothing about it apart it being directed by David Cronenberg and it receiving a fair amount of critical acclaim on it's initial release . This isn't necessarily a bad thing because at the heart of the story is the mystery surrounding protagonist Tom Stall who becomes an unwilling hero when two armed robbers walk in to his restaurant one night . At this point I was expecting to see a film dealing with a reluctant hero finding themselves trying to cope with celebrity culture and having a reputation that other lesser mortals want to test in the most basic and violent form ie "" Let's see if tough guy Tom Stall is really that tough "" Viggo Mortenson plays Stall in his usual convincingly understated manner and one wonders why he isn't a bigger name in Hollywood ? Possibly because he's an actor rather than a star and doesn't Stall in a showey manner , just an average family man wanting to get on with his life and the film does emphasise his everyman nature . The film does three distinct acts , Tom the family man , the mystery involving Tom and finally the showdown featuring Tom the man with a violent past The problem is that the first third is slightly slow which isn't necessarily a criticism , the second third is very intriguing and keeps the audience on the edge of their seats but the final third is fairly daft . Fair enough it's not too difficult to buy in to the idea that Tom was once involved with the mob but the violent climax at the home of mob boss Richie Cusack is rather ridiculous as he dispatches bad guys who in these type of movies stand around watching their colleagues get beaten to a pulp and not intervening till the good guy manages to get hold of a gun and only then does the bad guy pull out his own shooter only to get shot by the good guy . You've seen this all too often in straight to DVD releases and for two thirds of the way through you're aware that this is too far good to be anywhere near a Steven Seagal straight to DVD movie",A History of Violence
22,jotix100,The past comes back to haunt him,8,28 October 2005,"""A History of Violence"" is one of David Cronenberg's most accessible films; at least, one can relate to what the director is presenting for us this time without going completely berserk with some of his previous work. The film is based on a graphic book, maybe a comic type novel. The adaptation of Josh Olson works quite well as Mr. Cronenberg appears to have been inspired by the material and the excellent cast he assembled to play in it.The film starts with a gruesome scene that sort of sets the tempo about what will come later on. Then, the pace changes and we meet Tom Stall and his family sitting at the breakfast table. They appear to be as normal as one could expect from this Midwest setting of a rural community.When Tom, acting in self defense upon being menaced by the criminal pair we have seen in the opening scene, is made a hero, we have absolutely no clue as to why some strange men appear at his diner in town, or what they want him to account for. At the same time, things start unraveling at the Stall's household. Edie, the beautiful wife, start realizing there is another side to her husband she didn't know about. Also, Jack, the teen age son, being taunted by school bullies, proves he has quite a temper when he is unduly provoked.The point of the story seems to be you can hide, but you can't escape another life because when it's least expected it comes to haunt you with a vengeance, which is what happens to Tom, who has finally found happiness hiding away from sins he committed a long time ago. He has to face reality to distance himself from that past that will keep surfacing again, and again.The last sequence is one of the most effective, and positive, things of the film. We watch as Tom's family is preparing for dinner as he just comes home from the trip he took. Edie, Jack and Heidi are ready to start the meal, but obviously, they didn't expect Tom to come at that point and there is a general sense of expectation from all at this time. We watch as the camera captures the expressions from Edie, to Jack and finally to the sweet girl, Heidi, who takes it upon herself to get a table setting for her dad.This is perhaps one of the best Viggo Mortensen's characters in a long career. He is perfect as the man who is surprised by events he has buried, and forgotten. He has made a name for himself with hard work and the help of a beautiful wife who has no clue as to what is this man really like. Mr. Mortensen's expressions are deceiving in the first part of the film, but later on, he shows us another facet of his character as he resolves to deal with what is threatening his life, his family and his happiness.Maria Bello, proves also to be an actress of great range as Edie, the loyal wife who suddenly has to confronts a man who clearly has lied to her. Ms. Bello is an asset for the story. Ed Harris, one of the best actors, period, has a small part, but he is amazing with what he does with it. Ashton Holmes, as young Jack is also good. William Hurs has some good moments in the final part of the film and Peter McHattie, who plays the local sheriff makes a good contribution to the film.""A History of Violence"" is a film that must be seen because it shows a great director, David Cronenberg, at his best.",A History of Violence
23,LeonLouisRicci,Completely Off Center,8,17 March 2013,"A disturbing and unsettling Film with underplayed Characters and detached emotion. It is a haunting exposure of real-life horror into small town Family life. It is slowly paced as the tension unfolds and gripping just when it needs to be.There is some offbeat stuff associated with the Director as he modifies his panache and penchant to shock with an eye toward the mainstream, but alas his artistic flourishes are here nevertheless.It is a downbeat and dismal story of inner and withheld Demons and duality. The main characters all are changed, some drastically and some only trans-formative. This is complex and not easily approached in comfortable Cinema. But Cronenberg was never a Filmmaker to make comfortable Films.It is not without flaws. The sex scenes as handled are unorthodox and one gets the feeling that this is not a strong suit for the Director. They do come across as needed narrative but are shown to be a bit overdone and exploitative. Also, the sub-story of the children's involvement in all of this trauma is not as strong as the rest and keep it from being a seamless Masterpiece from this Director. That may be Dead Ringers (1988).",A History of Violence
24,dbborroughs,Not quite perfect but close,9,16 October 2005,"This is the story of Tom Stall. Tom is a small town family man who runs a diner, has a loving wife, and two good kids. When two men attempt to rob his diner he kills the robbers. The notoriety that follows brings some people to his door who think he's someone other than who he claims to be, and they haven't come for tea and crumpets.Graphically violent and sexual this this an adult thriller thats a taut ride through life of a man and his past. Its well done and shocking. Its a movie that will probably rattle your cage at some point along the way. If you can't handle graphic violence or sex you may want to pass.Many of the critics have hailed the film as an examination of the violence that seems to be a part of our society. I'm not sure its entirely successful in that way (why are films questioning the place of violence always so violent?), however as an examination of how our pasts can come back to haunt us, and how we can never be totally sure about the pasts of those around us its gangbusters. How much do you really know about the people in your life? Deeper meanings aside this is just a great thriller. We have some good guys we care about, and some bad guys we don't. You really care about these characters and what happens to them, so when the events spin out against them you're drawn in and hope that the bad things we see ahead for them don't come to pass. (much to the films credit, things don't always go as we think it will) As much as I really like this film, I don't think its perfect. I think the film is hurt by too much by some of the casting, or rather one piece of casting, William Hurt. Don't get me wrong there is nothing really wrong with Hurt in the film, rather he is too big a personality for his role. In a film that is full of ""real"" people of regular size, Hurt comes out as larger than life, he over powers the reality of the film. He makes things seem a little bit less real. Its not fatal, but it is a blemish on an otherwise excellent film.9 out of 10. This really is as good a film as the critics have said, though probably more as a thriller than as an examination as a the roots of violence.",A History of Violence
25,Bunuel1976,"A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE (David Cronenberg, 2005) ***",7,30 March 2006,"Although on paper the conventional thriller plot-line shares very little with Cronenberg's previous films, he imbues it with the usual visceral sequences of sex and death, only this time they give out a sense of catharsis rather than perversion. The film is very well-acted: Viggo Mortensen ably inhabits the two facets of the ambiguous main character (hard-working family man and cold-blooded killer); Maria Bello as his bewildered wife is the emotional core of the film; Ed Harris is perfectly cast as the mean-spirited, shadowy figure from Mortensen's part; and, of course, there is also a flamboyant Oscar-nominated turn from William Hurt as Mortensen's mobster brother.Having said that, I don't buy into the whole ""like father like son"" subplot in which Mortensen's son follows his father's lead by finally summoning enough courage to beat up the high school tough guy who's been picking on him for a long time; maybe it's because I've just watched John Carpenter's film adaptation of Stephen King's CHRISTINE (1983) where Keith Gordon does just that under the influence of his demonic car, who knows? However, I also didn't really get why his wife and son turned against Mortensen upon discovering his secret past. O.K, so he lied a little about who his parents were and consequently their family name is fictitious but, if it were me, I'd be proud of having a manly father rather than a wimp who just serves dinners all day long, wouldn't you? In any case, although I do admire Cronenberg a great deal as a film-maker, I'm not too fond of any of his films - with the possible exception of THE DEAD ZONE (1983) - because of the palpable sense of discomfort which they create in the viewer, so it's nice to see him tackle such issues as the family unit and the American way of life relatively normally. In fact, all things considered, I'd say that A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE is the best film Cronenberg has ever made; I particularly liked that languid, one-shot opening sequence which plays almost like a parody of Tarantino's depiction of hit men in his own movies and that whole darkly comic final sequence with William Hurt was the film's highlight.",A History of Violence
26,lastliberal,Do we really know someone?,8,22 April 2006,"I watched A History of Violence twice. Once by itself and once with the commentary. I wanted to watch it again, as it has captured my imagination like few movies. Watching Viggo Mortensen change back and forth from Tom to Joey was amazing. The subtle changes in his face as he changed roles is a tribute to his acting ability. But, it was Maria Bello that I really enjoyed, as she tried to come to grips with realizing the man she had loved for many years was not really the man she thought she knew. Ed Harris and William Hurt were also great, but when are they not.The movie raises so many questions. Do we really know people, even after many years? Can people really change, or is there just a thin veneer of respectability over us waiting to be stripped away to revel our true self? And, what is this thing about women and bad boys? I said that I wanted to watch it again, and I did, but I took a break to watch Maria in Assault on Precinct 13. There is nothing to really recommend this movie except for Bello and Drea de Matteo. It is always enjoyable to see Joey's sister. Otherwise the movie was unrealistic and dull.So, with apologies to Maria, whose birthday I overlooked this past Tuesday, I watched A History of Violence again today. It was just as good as the first two times. David Cronenberg directed this masterpiece to tell a compelling story and not waste a minute doing it. Another enjoyable performance by Bello and I cannot wait until the Villages shows Thank You for Smoking.",A History of Violence
27,Boba_Fett1138,Very realistic made movie that loses more and more of its power as the movie heads toward the ending.,7,23 June 2006,"The movie starts of promising; slow, realistic, mysterious and tense. A real Cronenberg gem. The movie mostly remains this good for at least half of its running time. After that the movie takes a not so positive turn and the movie goes from realistic to unrealistic, rapidly.I appreciate the straight-forwardness of the movie. The movie doesn't hold back with its violence, which is really brutal and graphic to watch. The straight-forwardness of the violence and the movie in general is probably the only reason remaining why this movie is better than the average thriller. The fact that the movie doesn't hold back and the characters in the movie, all make the movie very realistic to watch.From the moment on the Ed Harris character arrives the movie becomes both tense and mysterious. These are the best moments of the movie. The movie does have some great moments and twists in it, which I'm not going to spoil. However about halve way through the movie the story takes a not so positive turn. Suddenly all tension and mystery is gone and the movie turns into some average action flick, that above all is highly unrealistic and unlikely as well. Especially from the moment on when William Hurt's character gets introduced in the movie. The movie is filled with more flaws and improbabilities story-wise, such as the moments with the school bully, which I found to be utterly ridicules and not completely necessary. I understood the purpose of him for the story and for the forming of the Jack Stall character but still I have the feeling that the movie would had been better of without him. It are all obvious indications that this movie is too mainstream for David Cronenberg's style. Yes, there are moments of greatness both overall it's a fairly disappointing effort by Cronenberg, especially after hearing all the praise which the movie received. The hype-machine apparently did over-time for this movie. It's original, refreshing and it doesn't hold back but it however also has way too many flaws and improbabilities especially toward the ending, to regard this movie as one of the best of 2005. I can't imaging that a person who is familiar with Cronenberg's most other work won't be slightly disappointed by this effort of him. But yes surely, I would have said just as much negative about this movie if it was directed by a different person than Cronenberg. After all it's not the disappointment of seeing this movie being directed by a director who has made so much better and more realistic, straight-forward movies than this that makes the movie flawed but it's the story that mostly makes this movie a flawed one. But yes, of course the movie still has more positive thing as negatives things in it. The movie will probably still surprise and delight people. There really are moments which makes this movie tense and mysterious to watch, so as a thriller it surely serves its purpose. It still is a very powerful movie to watch, for most of its running time.The cast is good and the actors are cast to fit their characters as good as possible. Viggo Mortensen is good as a 'normal', recognizable every day person, who gets into some difficulties that seems bigger than him. Really great is Ed Harris in his role. He's mysterious and tough, the perfect combination of his character that is one of the most memorable performances by him of the last couple of years. On the other hand, William Hurt feels terribly out of place in his role. I can't believe that he actually received an Oscar nomination for his role in this movie.There are plenty enough reasons why you should watch this movie but I still feel that I need to warn, to not believe all the hype, which still surrounds the movie.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",A History of Violence
28,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Interesting...,8,16 November 2005,"Cronenberg is an interesting director; for most of his career, he made biological horror, dealing with viruses, mutations and the likes. In these last few years, he's moved away from that, focusing on more down-to-earth conflicts. His films still have the gratuitous violence and perverted sex that we've come to expect from his films... and a few things in this film seem to suggest that all of those years of violence and sex and extreme films have taken their toll on him. He's lost touch, which hurts this film, since it's supposed to present us with a regular American family, in a small, regular town... and Cronenberg's perspective on this is clearly skewed. The cast is too 'pretty'. Everyone looks like they could be a supermodel. Hardly ""regular people"". This vision of regular, everyday things being ever-so-slightly off, really hurts the film... it feels like what we're watching is pure imagination, a 'pretty' vision of typical America. Directly opposite of the point. Now that I've got that out of the way, let me say that this film was at least as good as I had expected from the trailer, and that says a lot. The violence is incredible; I don't mean what we see of it(though it is quite well-done), I mean the way it's used. The whole film is an excellent commentary on violence in our society, in our everyday lives, in our lives in general... violence and the consequences of it. The plot is intriguing and intelligently told. The pacing is grand. The way Cronenberg underplays important scenes, especially the way he hints at violent scenes to come is incredibly effective. The acting is mostly top-notch, with a few(yet quite important) exceptions. Mortensen, Bello and Harris are incredible. Hurt has an infinitely small but impactive role, and his acting surpasses just about everyone else's. The characters are well-written and credible. The writing is mostly good, though there are a few scenes and lines of dialog that don't seem to fit, that instead stick out and hurt the final product. The action is incredibly well-done, even though there isn't much of it, but it clearly isn't the point of the film. Very intelligent and well-crafted film, but hurt by Cronenberg's marred perspective of 'regular'. Definitely one to catch, though. I recommend this to anyone who can take it, and especially fans of Cronenberg. An enthralling and exciting experience. 8/10",A History of Violence
29,george.schmidt,"Cronenberg's best film since ""THE FLY""; Mortensen proves to be an implosive/explosive talent",9,23 September 2005,"A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE (2005) *** 1/2 Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello, Ed Harris, William Hurt, Ashton Holmes, Heidi Hayes, Stephen McHattie, Greg Bryk, Peter MacNeill, Kyle Schmid. (DIR: David Cronenberg)Mortensen proves to be an implosive/explosive talent.""There's no such thing as monsters,"" Tom Stall explains as he comforts his young daughter Sarah after she's had a bad dream. Monsters, no; demons, you bet. The nightmare is just beginning for the Stall family.Set in the fictitious Rockwellian town of Millbrook, Indiana, an atypical Midwest idyllic community that probably has a welcoming border stating, ""A Nice Place To Visit"" and surely offers fine home cooking with ""friendly service"" in the form of devoted, loving family man Tom Stall (Mortensen in a finely hewed turn) a nice enough guy who adores his children and is deeply in love with his wife, Edie (the always yummy Bello who also does a competent job here and is also underrated as a fine actress); what more could he ask for. Except one not so atypical day.As the diner is closing down one uneventful evening two strangers (McHattie and Bryk) enter for a quick spot of Joe and some meringue pie in spite of Tom's soft-spoken welcome of ""Sorry gentlemen, but we're closed."" What Tom does not know, but the audience has been alerted in the slowly paced, but deeply dreadening opening sequence is that Leland and Billy are very dangerous petty criminals who've run out of money on their road trip of murderous plans and have deigned to wreak havoc at Tom's place. When the two nasty men display their true colors, Tom moves like quicksilver into action unarming Leland and ultimately defending himself and his patrons/co-workers by making a hasty dispatch of the would-be murderers. Tom, injured in the melee, about to be released from the hospital and declared by all as a local hero, is also unaware that his troubles are just beginning.Enter mysteriously creepy Carl Fogaty (Harris in a spooky, menacing performance), a stranger to Tom (or so it would seem), whose disfigured face is as unsettling as his declaration of calling Tom, ""Joey"" as in Joey Cusack of Philadelphia, who apparently is Tom. Tom denounces this mistaken identity until things escalate and call into question just who (and more exactly 'what') Tom is.Filmmaker Cronenberg's skillfully unnerving adaptation of the graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke (with a shrewd screenplay by Josh Olson) slices down the middle of what America is all about: who we are and who we perceive ourselves to be in this at times stunningly violent and unwary story that turns serpentine moves on our protagonist with oily resolve. Cronenberg, no stranger to graphic carnage with his visceral horror fables like ""Videodrome"", ""The Fly"" and the best Stephen King adaptation to screen, ""The Dead Zone"", incorporates his sinister malice with aplomb as we discover Tom's descent into a hellish return to his troubled past. The violence is not necessarily shocking (the title is an apt metaphor) yet it packs a wallop that jolts the reality into sharp focus in the several sequences of swift vengeance and no second-guessing timing. Kudos to make-up artists Patrick Baxter and Sean Sansom for their queasily realistic and seamless work that should be a serious candidate for an Oscar nod.The film works for the most part despite a few scenes' dialogue that feel a bit under whelming and one or two moments of disbelief (the speed Tom makes back to his home from work on foot despite his injuries to protect his threatened brood seems too lickety-split). However Cronenberg continues to layer the suspense until the final act, which comes a bit too quickly, yet seems appropro to the proceedings at hand.Bello is a unique choice as well for her character is also a mystery (apparently the town's attorney but never shown applying her wares except in passing remarks)which makes the pair an interesting (and decidedly heated) couple (their two sex scenes are surely the most intense I've seen in some time on screen).Mortensen is a canny choice for his quiet spoken Tom yet the implosion (and inevitable explosion) is stacked in his favor with deft displays of emotion. He is torn up for the lies he's believed in and by the final frame it may cause one to wonder if he'll ever be who he thought he was again.",A History of Violence
30,view_and_review,Lackluster,4,11 March 2021,"This movie has shades of ""Long Kiss Goodnight"" with the lead being a man instead of Geena Davis. Instead of the lead character losing his memory he repressed it, and instead of being a government assassin he was a mob hitman.Tom Stall aka Joey Cusack (Viggo Mortensen) was a small-town owner of a diner with a quaint family and house in Millbrook, Indiana. He lived an idyllic Andy Warhol life with the only real problem being his son's bully.Allow me to digress here for a moment.I think every Hollywood writer who writes about high school was bullied. Either that or the same script writer writes every high school stereotype. In this movie we got a stale, recycled bully named Bobby (Kyle Schmid). He was an ultra-aggressive jock who drove a sports car and had a hard on for Jack (Ashton Holmes), Tom Stall's son, the unathletic nerd-type. One of the pretexts for Bobby attacking Jack was that Jack caught a poorly hit ball by Bobby for the last out of a baseball game in PE class!! REALLY!! This dude clearly has played baseball before--when you don't hit the ball out of the park it is subject to get caught! Actually, you EXPECT it to get caught. You don't get pissed off at the guy who caught it!! I guess they were trying to show how unstable he was, but it just came off as hokey and unbelievable.Bobby kept coming at Jack until Jack flipped out and beat the brakes off of him. I gather it was supposed to be a wonderful moment when the bully got his comeuppance, but I couldn't help but think, ""Why is he even in this movie? What's the point of his character?"" The cliché bully is one of the main reasons I can't stand teenager movies.Anyway, back to the review.Tom Stall's ""Leave it to Beaver"" life was upset by two would-be thieves. When two depraved crooks tried to rob his diner, he went Jason Bourne on them. He conjured up his dormant skills and dispatched of both of them. This act of bravery got him plenty of press coverage which brought some other bad guys to his doorstep, with the main one being Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris).Ed Harris was the only bright spot in this lackluster production. His character had style. Too bad he was unceremoniously killed. Then Tom/Joey went to Philadelphia to clean up the rest of the bad guys that would've come after him. It was rote, it was uninspired, it was unbelievable. Viggo didn't even have to move to kill his assailants. There were so many jump cuts I wonder if Viggo had to rehearse at all for his ""fight"" scenes. I think he just held his hands in the set positions while the bad guys did the rest of the work to kill themselves. Despite all the high marks ""A History of Violence"" didn't distinguish itself in any meaningful way.",A History of Violence
31,neil-476,"I'm in the ""Yes"" camp",8,24 January 2008,"It is a rich and rewarding world when we can freely express contrasting opinions on things like this movie. The opinions expressed here show that A History Of Violence does seem to polarise people, doesn't it? I'm not going to say ""It's crap"" or ""It's great"" - those are opinions masquerading as fact. I'm going to say that I enjoyed it and got a lot out of it.There are indeed unresolved plot-holes - I regarded them as the price to pay for what was at the heart of this film, which was the relationship between Tom and his family, and the effect on that relationship resulting from the diner incident. The violence - three very violent sequences, none of which lasts very long - is simply a catalyst for change within these relationships. I found the relationships convincing, and the changes understandable.Both sex scenes had dramatic justification and made points.I thought the little girl playing the daughter was not very good - American child actors are usually very good indeed, and she wasn't. Conversely, I thought Ashton Holmes, who played son Jack, was excellent.And I thought the ending *spoiler* which left the family relationship changes unresolved was one of the bravest endings I've seen in a film for a long time.",A History of Violence
32,evanston_dad,A Haunting Film,8,24 October 2005,"Viggo Mortensen has been allowed to shed the silly, macho, grizzled locks and attitude he was forced to don for three long years in a row for the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, and has finally been given the chance to play a real character, that of Tom Stall, steady-eddie dad and husband, who may or may not be hiding a shocking and violent past.Mortensen is terrific in this movie. It's one of those performances whose quality could be easily underestimated, because it's not a flashy role. No doubt at the end of the year, he will be overlooked for a bunch of actors who chew the scenery in phony Hollywood biopics, but such is the way of popular entertainment. Mortensen deserves accolades for this movie, and I hope other directors are paying attention to him.David Cronenberg's ""A History of Violence"" is a disturbing reflection on the pervasiveness of violence in our culture, the tendency to turn to violence first as a means of settling conflict, and the vicious cycle a reliance on violence can cause. In other words, violence breeds violence. I don't know that Cronenberg necessarily has anything new to say on the subject, but he has fashioned a haunting and memorable movie from the theme.Maria Bello was considered by many to be woefully overlooked for her performance in ""The Cooler"" from two years ago; my hunch is the community will make that oversight up to her this year for her performance as Tom Stall's wife. It's refreshing to see a wife/mother character who is required to do more than suffer nobly. Bello creates a vivid, strong, three-dimensional picture of a wife who has her entire world pulled out from under her and the steps she takes to deal with it.It's also nice for a change to see a movie where the violence matters, and has consequences. When violence occurs in this movie, it is quick and startling--there are moments when I wanted to look away from the screen. It just barely avoids being gratuitous, though, because it's not treated lightly. Part of the importance of the film's message is seeing what a bullet will do to a human face. Cronenberg approaches the material in a typically strange fashion (though this is one of the more accessible Cronenberg films). It varies widely in tone: the tense, brooding atmosphere created whenever criminals are part of the scene; the almost funny picture painted by Cronenberg of an idyllic American small town, complete with bouncy music and a quaint main street; the action movie quality that takes over whenever Mortensen's character springs into action. I'm not sure Cronenberg is entirely successful at blending these disparate elements, but I can appreciate what he was trying to do, and I felt that he was always in total control of his movie and made the finished product he wanted to make.So far, the Oscar-bait season of 2005 has been an unusually ripe one for tough and relevant films. Maybe the industry is finally reacting to 9/11 and the depressing, dispiriting hole American has fallen into since then at the hands of the Bush Administration. The last period of social and political unrest in America resulted in some of the best films ever made. Could we be on the verge of another period of greatness? Here's hoping.Grade: A",A History of Violence
33,ferguson-6,"Nobody's Perfect, Tom",9,2 October 2005,"Greetings again from the darkness. Director David Cronenberg has long been the master of creepy films. You already know this if you are familiar with: ""Spider"", the 1996 ""Crash"", ""Dead Ringers"", and ""The Fly"". Cronenberg always puts the viewer in a position that challenges our comfort zone, forces us to experience the uncomfortable situation that his characters experience. I for one, love this! ""A History of Violence"" may be his most commercially accessible film, but trust me when I tell you, it is not for everyone. More than a couple walked out. Maybe it was the realism of the violence (this is no cartoon), maybe it was the sexuality, or maybe it was that uncomfortable feeling of seeing a story that is a bit outside the Hollywood box. All of these work together to form a film that forced me to climb onboard and look around inside.Viggo Mortensen (""LTR"", ""Hidalgo"", ""G.I. Jane"") is remarkable as Tom Stall, a seemingly mild-mannered husband, father, small town café owner who with one reactionary moment, turns into a real life hero. The following publicity creates a situation where Tom's entire world is challenged. Is he a former mobster who has run away to a new life? Ed Harris is flat out scary as the rival mobster who the ""old Tom, AKA Joey"" maimed in a violent moment years ago. Harris is sure, but Viggo and his lovely wife, Maria Bello vehemently deny the allegations. Bello seems to have mastered the real life woman who has just a touch of sleaze to her (see ""The Cooler"" and ""Coyote Ugly""). She is a remarkable actress with a smile that lights the screen. You want to believe everything she says. Watching her as a cheerleader, on the stairs with Tom/Joey and being interviewed by the sheriff will make anyone appreciate what a talent she is.The film really takes off when Viggo visits William Hurt, who plays the mobster who is Joey's brother. This is Hurt's best work since ""Body Heat"". I almost believe he must be off-center to create this character. How marvelous to watch his few scenes with Viggo. This has Best Supporting Actor written all over it.Although the story is great and the acting is superb, the real star is Cronenberg's touch. We find ourselves laughing at moments that we normally would turn in disgust. These are real people in a real small town. This is masterful film-making. The only weakness I saw was Viggo's son played by Ashton Holmes. This is the film's only miscast role which is a relatively minor complaint. Overall, it will make you question the role violence plays in all of our lives and personalities. How would you change if put in this situation. I bet it will make you uncomfortable!!!

34,anaconda-40658,A History of Cronenberg.,9,15 June 2015,"A History of Violence (2005): Dir: David Cronenberg / Cast: Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello, Ed Harris, William Hurt, Ashton Holmes: One of David Cronenberg's best films. It symbolizes the breaking of a pattern of one's past. Viggo Mortensen plays an ordinary husband and father who works at a diner and becomes a local hero when he dispatches two criminals during a robbery attempt. Media spotlight brings unwanted attention as Mortensen becomes the target of organized crime that claims him to be someone else. Powerful and gritty although the conclusion may transpire mixed reactions. Director David Cronenberg demonstrates how one's decisions can inflict one's lifestyle just as he did with The Dead Zone and Crash. Mortensen delivers a great performance as a family man trying to begin again but finds himself driven reluctantly to a former life that leaves him with no other choice than to enact vengeance. Maria Bello is strong as his wife who will learn the truth and give a mixed reaction that could threaten the future of their family. Ed Harris plays a crime lord who interrupts their lives and will be dispatched by the unlikeliest factor. Great cameo by William Hurt who brings everything to light in the fatal conclusion. Ashton Holmes and Heidi Hayes play the anti hero's children. Extraordinary film about a history of regret and forgiveness sought. Score: 9 / 10",A History of Violence
35,FlashCallahan,Nice coffee Joey.....,10,31 May 2012,"Tom Stall is a loving family man and well-respected citizen of a small Indiana town.But when two savage criminals show up at his diner, Tom is forced to take action and thwart the robbery attempt.Suddenly heralded as a hero who took the courage to stand up to crime, people look up to Tom as a man of high moral regard. But all that media attention has the likes of mobsters showing up at his doorstep, charging that Tom is someone else for whom they've been looking.Is it a case of mistaken identity, or does Tom have a history that no one knows about? Either way, someone's about to find out....Easily Cronenbergs most accessible film since 'The Fly', AHOV still keeps us in the classic Cronenberg sense, no matter how many popular people are in this, it has a very vicious streak down it's marvellous spine.Mortensen is fantastic as Tom, and reason being is because he never changes the look on his face when he is defending his life or just serving coffee.The film explores violence in many ways, how it can dig up bad blood, inspire people, and turn people on.Bello has never been better than this, and even though he isn't in it very much, Harris is very scary and the best thing in the film.It gets only slightly daft toward the end, Hurt is okay as his brother, but puts on a silly accent and hams it up a little too much.But all in all it's a very rich film, and the last scene is touching, with everyone knowing that time is a healer, but some things should be left buried.An excellent film.",A History of Violence
36,gradyharp,A Good Idea Flawed by a Thunderously Bad Script,4,16 March 2006,"David Cronenberg has a style with his films that is unmistakable: he is unafraid to address the darker aspects that lie within us all. That he pushes this idea over the limits of viewable film is reflected in some of his popular films such as 'Dead Ringers', 'The Fly', 'Spider', 'eXistenZ', 'Naked Lunch' etc. Yet despite his apparent love of gore he drives home a point that should be considered. Most of the time he works with a good script. For A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE he is hampered by one of the most pedestrian, hackneyed, adolescent scripts trying to pass as a big time movie - Josh Olson's adaptation of the grisly pulp novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke.Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) is introduced to us as the head of a Hallmark happy-wappy family in Indiana - with his wife Edie (Maria Bello), son Jack (Ashton Holmes) and daughter Sarah (Heidi Hayes). Sure, Jack is harassed at school as a 'faggot' by a group of losers, but he takes it on the chin. Tom owns a diner where everybody just loves him - until one day when a couple of thugs disturb the placid boredom of the place and end up dead at Tom's too facile hands. Tom becomes a town hero, but the glow soon fades as big time crime enters in the guise of Fogarty (Ed Harris) plus thugs who enter the diner and confront Tom that he really is one Joey Cusack, a 'previous life' killer from Philadelphia. Tension mounts and ultimately Tom kills the intruders only to come to grips with some realities that are threatening and unpleasant and turn his family 180 degrees against him (in one of the most absurdly written reversals of family commitment ever written) in a fraction of a second. The rest is resolution of the Joey Cusack enigma and then the film just stops.The actors try to make this mess work but the lines they are required to murmur are just too bad to digest. But if you like gore and battered bodies and spree killings and dark motives with secret agendas, then the film may please. But how it got attention in the first place is a bit difficult to believe. The accompanying featurettes on the DVD show all the secrets behind the gore and include scenes eventually deleted for good reason. Grady Harp",A History of Violence
37,The_Void,Cronenberg's best in nearly two decades and an awesome film to boot!,9,3 October 2005,"David Cronenberg was once an exciting director that made great films in his own style. Things went awry for him in 1996, as Crash was terrible; and his next two films, eXistenZ and Spider, were resoundingly worse. It's been nearly two decades since his last successful film, Dead Ringers, but I am pleased to report that Cronenberg has finally regained his footing and delivered one of the very best of his career with A History of Violence. In fact, the man really has outdone himself this time. His best films are usually the more trashy horror flicks where he gets to have fun; but he's proved that he can handle more mature material this time round; and that his handling of Spider was just a blip - not an indication that mature drama is beyond him. A History of Violence is a film that works on all fronts. We follow Tom Stall; a small town café owner, who finds himself languishing in the glow of the media spotlight after he heroically murders two criminals after they threatened him and his staff. It isn't long before a mob boss is on his tail, believing him to be another man by the name of Joey Cusack, and soon he and his family are forced to learn the true horror of violence.I spend a lot of my time watching horror movies, and most of the time with these films; acting isn't an important element. I've learnt to ignore bad acting in favour of a strong story - but when a film is well acted, it really does benefit it immensely. I never had Viggo Mortensen down as a credible actor since the Lord of the Rings films were the only ones I'd seen him in; but he really proves his worth here with a brilliant performance that sees him take in every aspect of his character and translate it onto the screen. The rest of the ensemble gets on well, with Ed Harris standing out as much as ever. The only real qualm I have on the acting side is the lack of chemistry between the members of the central family - they're all good actors, but I never really got the feeling that they were a family. This film is an a-class drama, but don't be fooled into thinking that the violence will be restrained. There's plenty of blood, and some of the shots; such as one that sees a man's nose literally spread over his face, will definitely shock the audience. However, this is, of course, the message that Cronenberg's film is portraying.The themes of violence are more than evident throughout. A History of Violence portrays the way that violence breeds violence, and how that in turn can break down everything that is good. Through a film-noir like narrative; the film takes in everything about the central character, and we get to see how his descent into violence not only affects his family, but also the man himself. We also get to see how violence is a definite part of society, and this is shown clearly by the way that no matter how much he tries to be a family man; the violence cannot be taken out of Tom Stall. It would seem that Tom isn't the only one harking back to his past, as Cronenberg shows his more playful side with a brilliantly black comic set piece towards the end, and several shocking sequences throughout the film. Don't get me wrong, A History of Violence has been directed by a much more mature filmmaker than the man who made the likes of Rabid and Scanners; but it's nice to see that he's retained some of the qualities that made his earlier films such a joy to watch. Overall, this is a top quality film; and I'll be very surprised if awards aren't being heaped on it come next spring.",A History of Violence
38,mm-39,Not a bad movie graphic in many ways,7,11 October 2005,"The film is about a study in violence. A man with a good standing in a peaceful community is throwing into a violent situation, and his violent past catches up with the media attention of being a hero. The film has many levels of violence. The true evil violence of the 2 individuals that kill rape for violence sake. The protagonist who try to avoid violence. the protagonist son who deal with violence at school, and professional criminal who control and respect violence. All the sub stories have the same theme violence creates fear and fear controls people. The son's situation and the two criminals at the dinner enjoy the control and fear in a sadistic way. The higher criminals respect violence for the real danger that violence represents. Business for the profession, is what comes first and violence/fear is a part of business even when approached with personal insults the situation is handled professionally. Is violence instinctual or intellectual? The final question can a violent man change? Is asked in the film. Go see the movie and answer the questions for yourself. The film gave myself yes to both the answers. 7 out of 10",A History of Violence
39,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: A History of Violence,7,1 December 2005,"Finally, a movie based on a source material that I've read! Based on the graphic novel of the same name by writer John Wagner and artist Vince Locke, A History of Violence is David Cronenberg's latest film starring Viggo Mortensen (don't know why, but I'm always seeing Elessar in his new character...) I'm usually OK with film adaptations not sticking closely to the material it's based on, basically because they're on different mediums, and it's a bore to have the movie follow the book word for word, scene for scene. Although this review will be working on the premise that it is a stand alone film, I can't help to notice that, unfortunately, the book told the better story, in terms of characterization (ok, so the movie is relatively short, clocking in about 90mins) and the back story on Tom's (Viggo) history.If you'd bear with me, I'd highlight some of the major departures from the book - Tom's son now has a beefed up role, Ed Harris's wounded eye is on the wrong side (as shown in the trailers and movie, it's on his left, but it should be the right) and Tom's last name from McKenna has been changed to Stall. The story and ending of Richie has been totally changed. The book has 3 chapters, but it's only the first that the movie dwells upon, and completely changing and summarizing the last 2 chapters.The introduction is one incredibly long, and slow scene which showcases the 2 killers that Tom dispatches in his diner thereafter. I like this scene which is superior to the book, but somehow it sets the pace of the entire movie - slow and measured.The story tells of an everyday all American Family, the Stalls, who live in a small town of Millbrook, Indiana, being brought to the limelight when head of the household Tom, guns down 2 violent thugs who robbed his diner and threatening his customers. Tom, a soft-spoken man, becomes the town's hero, and soon after, more thugs from the East Coast come and stalk him and his family.But is Tom the man he claims he is, or has his past finally caught up with him? Playing Tom, Viggo Mortensen puts up a credible performance as the unassuming Tom Stall, and does an about turn as a violent character of his past. While the theme talks about violence and the debate on the necessity of it, it gets brushed away pretty quick towards the last act, which degenerates this movie into a short actioner.Needless to say, the psyche of the Family plays an important role between contrasting the relationship between Tom and his wife and kids, which changes as the movie progresses, and that between Tom and Ritchie (completely re-written for the movie), which I thought was a pity.The R21 rating is for violence (gruesome shots of heads blown off etc), but if they'd stuck to the book, there'll be more scenes like the one with the drill-in-the-leg torture scene, etc. But Cronenberg decided to include sex scenes between Tom and his wife, which figured some cheerleading role play, a 69, and a totally out of character rowdy staircase romp. Hello, this is not a History of Sex. (I know it's Cronenberg, but still) While I liked this film for its slow pace (no frantic MTV styled quick cuts, or scenes which appear and disappear at the bat of an eyelid), I can't shake off the feeling that this film had the potential to be way, way better. Excellent I do not think so, but it still is an enjoyable movie to catch on a weekday.",A History of Violence
40,Mr-Fusion,"Up until a certain point, it's pretty good",5,20 January 2016,"""A History of Violence"" . . . an odd duck, this one.Cronenberg's meditation on past lives and the harmful effects of brutality on domestic life is an effective one. He lays on the small-town American wholesome like nobody's business and the bloodshed is reserved, only exploding when it has to to prove the point in the story. It works, and the performances sell the whole thing (especially Ed Harris, who is one scary son-of-a-B).And then, very late in the game, it goes south. I dunno if this is a spoiler or not, but . . . okay, SPOILERS . . .William Hurt shows up as the big crime boss and the movie suddenly flips a switch into comedy. I'm not sure what Hurt was going for here, or whether it's the performance or the direction he was given, but there's no way a guy like that could preside over hardened scaryass killers like Harris. No way. And naturally super-thug Viggo Mortensen wipes out all of the henchmen, and Hurt is left dumbfounded. It's a jarring turn.It is a categorically awful character. Damn near derails the whole train.5/10",A History of Violence
41,siderite,Very good movie lost on audience,8,20 November 2005,"I will not say anything about David Cronenberg, as others have said enough. I will focus on Viggo Mortensen. I think he is a good actor, but this particular film showed it best. He goes from mild man to violent killer in split seconds, from horny lover to loving husband, uses a wide range of emotions and acting styles in a single movie.That made me look at his filmography and got a number of 43 films, some of them very good. One remembers him, of course, from Lord of the Rings, but how about 28 Days, Psycho, Crimson Tide, Carlito's Way, Young Guns II or Witness? Being a good actor doesn't necessarily mean an accomplished one, though. He has the skills, he has the looks, I just hope he will be more cast from now on.Now about the film. I think this is an intelligent movie, also very well done and one that really makes its point. It's not one of those movies that only the screenwriter and director understand anything, it is a very open and communicative film. However, I wonder how many from the audience will actually appreciate it all? It has a lot of action for the action bufs, it has love and family for the girls and it has the intelligent and complex plot for the intellectual minority. But how many will actually take the movie as a whole and like it?Let's cut it short: Maria Bello goes a long way from Coyote Ugly, still hot, though. Ed Harris makes a good role, but rather short, William Hurt also appears in a too secondary role I think. The acting is good, good soundtrack, good plot, I say it again.I think the way to best enjoy this movie is to put yourself in the place of all the characters in the movie, especially in their moments of violence, and see how that feels like.Overall: watch it!",A History of Violence
42,Smells_Like_Cheese,"A great movie, but questioning moments do come up",7,21 March 2006,"A History of Violence was a fantastic film and in my opinion one of the best from 2005. The story is extremely original and exciting. The acting is great, especially from Viggo turning into a sort of Dr. Jeckyl/Mr. Hyde type of character. But there were moments I questioned the story, because of the relationship between the wife and husband and a little bit of a cliff hanger ending. I'm not sure on how emotions can work on a husband and wife because I'm not married, however, I questioned on some of the wife's reactions and actions in itself.Like I said though, I thought that still this was an excellent movie and I would highly recommend it. It's got great acting, a cool story, and will keep you entertained and guessing until it's conclusion. Let's hope Hollywood will keep this up.7/10",A History of Violence
43,MovieAddict2016,Cronenberg's most commercial film -- and very disappointing,6,13 April 2006,"This should have been better. Cronenberg knows how to make a movie. He also knows satire. Unfortunately, he's still struggling with aspects of regular narration, and that is ultimately where ""A History of Violence"" fails. The point of the movie: violence has an impact, whether immediately or in the long run. But Cronenberg loves gore - he almost has an obsession with it. His penchant for the grotesque makes its way into the film (shattered noses, faces shredded to pieces by gun battles) -- the visual effects are spectacular, but they don't belong in a film that tries to balance the effects of violence. It makes his movie a giant contradiction.Another narrative element he struggles with is trying to make a normal movie. As a filmmaker, he's way out there -- ""The Fly"" is considered (or was considered up until ""Violence"") to be his most commercial film -- yet even ""The Fly"" was bizarre. His fans know he's weirder, usually - check out ""Naked Lunch,"" ""Scanners,"" ""Videodrome"" or ""M. Butterfly."" The weird aspects creep into ""A History of Violence."" It doesn't always work. It does make a tie with the graphic novel it's based upon, but it disconnects from reality, too -- and this film really needs to be rooted in reality to work as a moralistic story. Otherwise it's just lessons from another world that don't apply to our own - and then what's the point? The good: Ed Harris is extraordinary. The direction in the beginning is excellent. The tension works. And it's an entertaining, unusual movie -- it's not bad. It's just lukewarm. It's not as good as it thinks it is, and it's not as good as it should have been. Part of it is Cronenberg's fault, and part of it is the lead performance by Viggo Mortensen. He's TOO subdued -- there's a fine line between playing a tormented character and a one-note one. De Niro in ""Once Upon a Time in America"" did the same thing better. Other actors have, too.The script's bad, also. The teen subplot is unnecessary and ridiculous. Jocks aren't that stereotypical. Is it a Cronenberg film or a John Hughes one? I bought it on DVD. I'm a Cronenberg fan. Maybe I'll watch it again with the rest of the commentary and try to re-evaluate it. (I know that's necessary with some of Cronenberg's films.) But this one failed to impress me on the same level as ""Naked Lunch"" or even ""The Fly.""",A History of Violence

It's a mythic movie about fighting the inner demons and the past. The screenplay is interwoven pretty well, even the subplots played a important role as well. And has to do with the proximity of lust and violence and how it surrounds some families. The exploration of the main characters past and his transition to the present would have been nice to watch though, but it wasn't in the film. The movie is not really brilliant or super fascinating, but it's a well crafted film overall. More depth to the plot would have made the movie much better though.

46,Buddy-51,flawed but compelling film,7,1 June 2006,"David Cronenberg's ""A History of Violence"" works pretty well for the first two-thirds of its running time, then slithers to pieces in a slew of implausibilities and mob-movie clichés.Tom Stall is a genial man living an unobtrusive and generally happy life with his wife and two children in rural Indiana. All that changes one night, however, when two armed men enter his diner, threatening to kill him, his customers and his employees. When Tom turns the tables on the perpetrators, killing them instead, he is immediately acclaimed a hero by the townsfolk and the local media, until some mysterious men in suits arrive a few days later, implying that Tom may actually be an ex-mobster named Joey Cusack gone into hiding. Even his wife and teenaged son begin to suspect that the man they know as husband and father may, in fact, be a complete stranger to them.In terms of its substance and style, this is one of Cronenberg's most straightforward, least esoteric works. Derived from the graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke, the film asks the fascinating question of whether it is possible for a killer to ever truly find redemption and escape the sins of his past. The movie is at its most compelling when concentrating on the effect the life-shattering realization has on the people closest to Tom, the almost ambivalent way in which his wife and son are both appalled and strangely titillated by discovering that the man they knew as a decent family man may instead be a cold-blooded killer. For the most part, the film is thoughtful and well-paced, taking time to establish the details and rhythms of life in a rural setting before slowly laying out the complex melodrama that eventually ends up engulfing the characters.However, in the last half hour, the movie reveals some of the weaknesses inherent in movies derived from graphic novels. When Tom/Joey heads back to Philadelphia for a confrontation with his mob boss brother (hammily overplayed by a balding William Hurt), the film devolves into a series of highly implausible fight scenes that look as if they have, indeed, been lifted straight off the pages of a comic book. Thus, all the efforts to make the story ring true pretty much fly out the window at this point. Moreover, the final scene of family reconciliation resembles one of those bad codas one finds in ""meaningful"" plays by first-year drama students. It's too carefully worked out, too deliberately staged, and too cute by half to be truly effective.Viggo Mortensen underplays nicely in his role of a passive man who may be a powder keg of violence and emotion under his placid surface, and Maria Bello registers just the right amount of devotion and befuddlement in the part of his wife. Ed Harris also scores as the scarred, half-blinded gangster who winds up shattering the family's idyllic life.All in all, ""A History of Violence"" is a fascinating, albeit deeply flawed, work that never lives up to its full potential. It's a finely directed and well acted film, but something about it just doesn't ring entirely true.",A History of Violence
47,sol-kay,We live in violent times,8,6 December 2007,"****SPOILERS**** Shocking and penetrating motion picture that shows with all the violence that were exposed to and are effected by every single day, real and imaginary, how near impossible it is to become a civilized and law abiding citizen no matter how hard one tries.The case in point in the movie is the friendly and non-violent diner owner Tom Stall, Viggo Mortense,who goes as far as telling his teenage son Jack, Ashton Holmes,to turn the other cheek even when he's sat upon and attacked, verbally as well as physically, by school bully Bobby, Kyle Schmid. Bobby who thinks he's real tough, especially when he has his friends with him, has been making Jack's life a living hell after he caught a ball that Bobby hit costing his team the high school championships final game. Jack later settles the score with Bobby who, like his dad Tom, just had enough and took matters into his own hands as well as feet.Tom for his part has his life turned around when these two homicidal manics Leland & Billy, Stephen McHattle & George Bryk, entered his diner one evening demanding money. Ready to give into their demands Tom lost it when they were about to blow his waitress Charlotte, Deborah Drakeford, away just for laughs. In a matter of seconds Tom changed from a mild mannered and peaceful person into a killing machine taking out both Lealand and Billy, with their own guns, and ending up with his foot, by Leland driving knife into it, badly injured.With Tom's picture plastered all over the both local and national newspapers, as well as on TV, he attracted someone from his dark past someone who knew him back in Philadelphia as Joey Cusack. Stopping into Tom's diner Carl Fogarty, Ed Harris, and a couple of his hoods start to hassle Tom about his past existence as mob hit-man Joey Cusack. Tom tells the hideously deformed, he looks like the little Crypt Keeper in Vault of Horrors, Forgarty that he's all wrong about him being Joey but a smiling Forgarty knows that he's lying which greatly disturbed Tom's wife Edie, Meria Bello. Edie at the time was replacing the very shook up Charlotte as the diners waitress.It takes a while for Tom to finally come clean with his murderous past to both his family and Fogarty, who's scared face he's responsible for, and that leads to Fogarty, who was holding Jack hostage, and two of his hoods getting the living cr*p beaten out of them with the trio eventually ending up in the local Millbrook morgue!Having lived for some twenty years in blissful obscurity Tom, together with his family, is now a marked man and to come to grips with the horrors that he now finds himself in he has to go back to that past that he so painfully put behind him.The movie ""A History of Violence"" uses graphic and almost unwatchable violence to, like shock treatment, shock and educate it's audience in how horrible and inhuman violence really is. Not glorify it like so many movies do today as well as in the past.Tom despite being a hero in preventing a massacre, like earlier in the movie, by psychos Leland and Billy from happening in his diner is looked upon as a heartless and cold-blooded killer by the very people, as well as his wife Edie, who's lives he saved. The fact that Tom kept his past, as a brutal mob hit-man, hidden was all the reason for his wife Edie as well as his son Jack, luckily not his five year old daughter Sarah (Heidi Hayes), to turn against him.Going back to his hometown in Philadelphia to finally settle some old and now very pressing family business matters, before those matters settle or kills him, Tom is on automatic pilot ready willing and able, despite having been both stabbed and shot earlier in the movie, to get the job done. It's a job that he should have done a long long time ago when he was still Joey Cusack.",A History of Violence
48,Robert_duder,"Perhaps too serious, intense, and intelligent",7,5 October 2005,"I don't think it's any secret that David Cronenberg is twisted. I might even say the man has a hint of psychosis going on...I mean his films are blood soaked, orgies and usually quite peculiar. Despite the fact that his films are gory and shocking, I really think that's just his style and he's not going for shock value...this really is HIM!! I think he's over rated. However, A History of Violence will most certainly be an Oscar contender for it's artistic quality, deep moral message and powerful performances by it's lead characters. I would even go so far as to say that History of Violence will be considered classic cinema for it's horrific violence and story.Viggo Mortenson is a powerful presence in the lead character as Tom Stall. He gives a perfect performance as the passive family man Tom Stall but then also gives a believable and terrifying performance as his alter ego Joey Cusack. He's believable as both the family man and the deadly killer. Also turning in an amazing performance is actress Maria Bello as Tom's wife. She has had some memorable decent roles in the past but nothing as emotional and powerful as this. I think this really showed her range and was well done. Although Cronenberg used her as an object of sex, her character was strong enough to be more than that. Ed Harris was in a unfortunately small role. The man is an incredible actor but even in this small role, he's downright disturbing as the evil mobster. His look and voice and mannerisms are perfect for the film. A real break out role in the film is the actor who plays Jack Stall, Mortenson's son. His strong and emotional performance is great and deserves all the notice in the world.The film is a little draggy...it's far from mainstream. It's a very artistic film and aims for intelligence. The story is well done and very in depth and simple enough but even still most will find it too slow for their tastes. It's also quite twisted, not only for it's violence but it's depravity when it comes to sex. It's Cronenberg's disturbing style. It's an acquired taste. I think History of Violence is a prime candidate for the Oscars...not necessarily because it's astounding but because of it's artistic merit. The film is brutally violent. The death scenes are horrifying and gory...unlike anything I've ever seen so people will likely flock to it to see that. It's certainly not the best thing in the theater unless you're into the extreme artsy film making in which case you must see this one!! 7/10",A History of Violence
49,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Cronenberg returns with maybe his most mainstream effort to date,9,2 October 2005,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits Tom (Viggo Mortensen) ebbs out a quiet existence running a café in a quiet little suburban American town with his wife (Maria Bello.) One night, just as he is closing up shop, two men come in and hold up the store. Instantly re-acting with skill and professionalism to this dangerous situation, small-town America's answer to Roy Cropper blows both the men away with sudden, shocking effectiveness. Hailed as a hero, Tom and his missus soon have the place up and running again. But then a mysterious man (Ed Harris) enters the café with some cronies and sets the fear of alien invasion racing through the heart of the viewer, as he resembles one of the Men in Black in his dark suit and glasses. But he's actually a gangster named Fogarty with a deformation on his right eye that he says is owed to Tom and his apparent shady past. Their presence in the town looks set to be a permanent one and, when his family become embroiled in their claims, Tom is forced to examine his past and wonder whether what they're saying really is true.Actually, this may be the first Cronenberg film to date I've actually seen. His style is a very unique but simple one, but not really any less effective.A History of Violence is a clever, intriguing concept and one that is carried off with a neat degree of flair and style.Performances wise, Mortensen continues to build up his mainstream Hollywood profile and is on fairly good form here. And there is good support from Bello, William Hurt and Harris, bringing an icy, cold edge to the bad guy role.Overall, what we have here is an engaging, effective story that leaves a lasting impression on the viewer. ****",A History of Violence
50,ElMaruecan82,"Not your typical ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" film ....",10,10 August 2011,"""A History of Violence"" is an intelligently subversive shocker, and sure the hell one of the best movies of a rather average cinematic decade. At the risk of sounding politically incorrect, which this movie invites to be anyway, I think that there's an interesting significance in the fact that the director of this masterpiece is Canadian. He definitely belongs to a different school, where it's not about the amount of blood gushing from a body, let alone the numbers of punches a face can endure without being disfigured, violence here illustrates our most repressed, yet innate sides of our dark nature and is outrageously portrayed in a form which is anything but appealing; it's ugly, brutal, and absolutely revolting. Never had corporal damages been so rightfully depicted.The title is great, and doesn't lie about the content; violence here is displayed with an authenticity so vicious it's almost pleasurable to watch. If it wasn't for its misleading ordinary setting, ""A History of Violence"" should be regarded as a film with the same revolutionary aspect of Peckinpah's films, but with a crucial innovation, it doesn't feature the stylishness that could provide it an entertaining value. Still, the ugliness is so new; we literally 'enjoy' it on an intellectual way. This is the thought-provoking perversity of ""A History of Violence"", a masterpiece of storytelling whose intelligence relies on the Darwinist idea of the survival of the strongest, something that confront us, if not reconciles, with our inner bestiality as to sustain the idea of the instinctive, even hereditary, aspect of violence, hence the ""history"" of violence.The main character is a mild-mannered hard-working café worker, father of two kids, named Tom Stalls, played in all nuance by Viggo Mortensen. No one would ever suspect not only he possesses the instinct but also the skills of a perfect killer, but the film, confidently takes its time to introduce the nice little Stalls family, with the little Sarah and Tom, who somewhat inherited his father's gentleness: constantly bullied by an arrogant prick named Bobby Singer, a caricature of the popular high school boy, Jacks never fights back, admits his defeat and lets Bobby's anger boiling inside him. Finally, the only character who seems to have balls in the family is the mother, Edie, played, by the beautiful Maria Bello. The Family lives in their small little town until two thugs enters Tom's café.In a shocking opening, these two guys are shown as brutal murderers who don't give a damn about human life, they kill with the most detached ruthlessness echoing the atrocities we learn everyday. The roots of violence are the total lack of empathy, killing one person is denying his right to live, killing a motel maid just to steal water it puts an inhuman equation between the act of stealing and killing. And the worst step consists on enjoying it, not only it sustains the lack of empathy but also the pleasure to be the one who applies the violence. When a man kills an innocent little girl, well, basically, he can kill anyone, and if the next scene, Tom comforts little Sarah, that monsters don't exist, he lives in an unconscious denial and when he kills the two monsters, in a thrilling act of self-defense, one of them has his face blown off, and his disfigured face is having bloody spasms. Despite the horror, we cheer for the villain's demises and cheer for the hero. We realize how strength is vital as the only answer to the men's vileness. The café's incident will be a pivotal moment in Tom's life as it will concentrate enough media attention to resurrect the ghosts from the past.Violence took such a part in Tom's past it defined his genetic heritage, when Jack can't take Bobby's provocations anymore, and finally reacts, something happens, the bully becomes a helpless victim, revealing his non-violent nature, hinted earlier where he encountered the two thugs in the car. The roles are inverted underlining the very confined nature of violence; it's inside us, something almost natural. This is this very nature Tom tried to restrain but his heroic act, reminded him of his condition. And he had no choice than getting rid of the past to definitely clear these bloody stains. Here again, violence occurs during three different parts, letting us time to savor the expectancy of violence in its most brutal way, in a thrilling tension before violence is released in an orgasmic brutality. This is our own perversity as people who enjoy seeing the baddies getting it, just because they belong to the wrong side shouldn't allow us to enjoy their punishment. Our enjoyment is our acceptance of our submission to Darwin, we accept Stall's strength, as we accept any one stronger than us.And, the movie's genius is to transcend this strong vs. weak interactions into extraordinary depiction of the sexual act, in the same level of graphicness. ""A History of Violence"" breaks many taboos, and establishes an obvious correlation between sex and violence, the two calls of the wild. In the first scene, Edie dominates, and lets Tom express his love but with no explicit signs of penetrations. When Tom's true nature is revealed, the sex on the stairs is less staged, no cheerleader outfit, no bed, and no preparation. Tom doesn't fool around with Edie, it's not a rape, as she accepts the violence, turned on by an aspect that makes Tom almost a better lover, now that he's a better killer. There's a part animal, part human in us, and the hypocritical aspect of our denunciation of violence relies on the way it states our personality."" A History of Violence"" in a thrilling realism, served by a great screenplay and solid performances, including a scene-stealing performance by William Hurt, will define your human status to your personal approach to violence and sex, the questions are disturbing, but no less than the answers",A History of Violence
51,dromasca,one of the best movies of Cronenberg,8,29 April 2006,"David Cronenberg's films seem to be obsessed with the co-existence of the extremes, of bad and evil - in the same body as in 'The Fly', on the same highway as in 'Crash', in the same game as in 'eXistenZ'. In his latest film he seems to be saying - evil is here among us, it is dormant in any of us, it can be awaken and maybe put to sleep again, but at a price.The story is told with minimal means. Tom Stall is a mid-age mid-business owner in a mid-state, the type of environment which is the fabric of quite and conservative America. One evening two killers enter his coffee shop and he does what any good American hero should do - kills them to defend his property and his co-workers. Having become a local celebrity, life does not turn to the good for him, as mobsters come to visit him, pretending that he is a hidden criminal, which he denies convincingly and intending bring him back to a crime life. When he again will do the hero act to defend his family his dexterity in holding a gun raises everybody's suspicion.Viggo Mortensen is doing a remarkable act. His only previous big time role was in 'Lord of the Rings', but there is nothing here to remind Peter Jackson's epic. His role reminds more Bill Murray's 'Broken Flowers', he is filling the screen with a calm that hides intense feelings. Another couple of great secondary riles are being filled in by Ed Harris and Willian Hurt.It's not a perfect movie. ALthough it lasts less than 100 minutes which is quite remarkable in today's Hollywood, it still has a good 15 minutes of redundant stuff, including a secondary story thread involving the hero's son high-school conflicts and two 'steamy' sex scenes unneeded for the logic of the movie. On the other hand the film ending is so memorable that I can already place it among the best endings in the history of cinema, close to the one of 'Casablanca'. 'A History of Violence' is worth seeing, one of the best of Cronenberg and one of the best of 2005. It's a shame that the Oscars seem to have ignored it totally.",A History of Violence
52,MLDinTN,original plot,7,18 October 2006,"I liked the originality of the story but there are plot holes. The movie completely leaves out how Joey became Tom Stalls. It would have been interesting to find that out. Then at the end, we get a sort of conclusion, but what makes Tom think none of the other gangsters told other mobsters about finding him after all these years. It looks like Tom would always be looking over his shoulder and have to keep the family on the move. I find it hard to believe his wife was so forgiving after finding out he lied to her since he knew her, plus killed people. And she knew he killed those mobsters at the end, but didn't leave him.Tom's nifty fight moves was pretty cool. He certainly knew how to street fight.FINAL VERDICT: I recommend it. It's not the same ole same ole put out by Hollywood every year.",A History of Violence

But when shady people start showing up in Stall's family life, things start to get intense.The acting is very good especially by Ed Harris and William Hurt. They both make effective mobsters. I can't say anything wrong about Viggo Mortensen or Maria Bello. Those two have incredible chemistry.This is not a perfect movie, but it comes very close.

What will be different from character to character is the morality, the goals, the interaction with other human beings, the giving or taking of love. What is the same is one single thing. Competence. Usually at killing. I have seen a lot of these films, most of you have too, but this is one of the best. It is almost pitch perfect, even with the wonderful nuance of, say, what happens when a wife realizes her husband is one of the deadliest men on the planet. Both Mortensen and Cronenberg have left has an impressive body of work but this film is special. It is possibly (and likely) one of the greatest films ever done extolling the skilled professional. Lots of subthemes, yes, and a wonderful performance by Ed Harris, but at the end of the day, if you are a guy, you head home thinking that this is what the audience must have felt like at the end of an early John Wayne film, or when A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS exploded, or when Jean Reno first appeared on screen in the Professional, or when Jet Li ... well, you see where I am going.

55,CuriosityKilledShawn,Don't make me angry,8,25 September 2005,"Fate and destiny intertwine and connect in ways you can't imagine. What can two mass-murderers travelling across country possibly have to do with old crime syndicate grudge from almost 20 years ago? The answer is a man called Tom Stall. An average family man living a quiet life in a peaceful country town. Had these two murderers simply passed on through his town instead of stopping at his café then hell would not break loose. It's a million to one coincidence, but life is like that.Tom responds with sudden, unexpected lethal force when the men try to hold up his café. And before you can say 'wowzer' both men are dead with their guts and skull fragments all over the floor. Tom is hailed as local hero and his picture and story is soon all over the news.But gangsters watch the news too. And hideously scarred Carl Fogaty (the very cool indeed Ed Harris) recognises the pictures on TV not as Tom Stall, but as Joey Cusack. A man to whom he owes a serious ass-kicking. Carl and his goons promptly show up in town and quiz Tom over his new identity. Obviously he thinks they are crazy.All could have been okay if they just left, but their constant watching and hounding slowly brings back to life a side of Tom that died a long time ago. Without continuing to give away the whole plot, a major bloodbath follows.The violence is short, sharp, to the point and jaw-droppingly brutal. Just the way I like it. This is not some PG-13 kiddie's movie. A film condemning violence only to not show it in it's full, bloody gory glory would only be hypocritical. Tom does not like what he is doing. But when his life and the lives of his family are threatened, the only way to successfully respond is to put them bad guys down as quick as possible. There is no gun pornography or ballet-dancing here.The lesson of the movie is that a man can change. Violence will only lead to more violence and ultimately, when you really think about it, it doesn't solve anything. Yes, I know it's an old cliché but there are not many movies out there that make an attempt to prove it true. Cronenberg, in a change of pace from his usual body-horror and mind-games movies, directs with perfect timing and encourages flawless performances from the whole cast.It would be too much to call it Cronenberg's best work as all of his films have a lot of class to them, but it's definitely one of his most important.",A History of Violence

57,Bored_Dragon,Powerful,8,13 January 2018,"Besides ""Road to Perdition"", this is, I think, the only non-superhero movie based on DC comics and convincingly the best Cronenberg's film I've ever seen. I do not know how to present a brief summary of this movie without spoilers, so I'll skip the story itself. At first glance, this is a thriller with superbly directed action scenes, explicit violence, and wild sex. But if you look more closely, you'll notice that camera doesn't linger on thriller aspects. It focuses more on emotional expressions of characters, making this movie more a family drama than a thriller. Great choice of actors and excellent characterization. Even characters that appear briefly have depth and you will experience them as real people, as if you personally met them. Viggo Mortensen, Ed Harris, William Hurt, Ashton Holmes, and Peter MacNeill are all perfect in their roles, but Maria Bello literally brought hers to life.

David Cronenberg director of Spider (2002), eXistenZ (1999), Naked Lunch (1991),and most famous for The Dead Zone (1983) and Scanners (1981) brings to the screen in a raw and graphic way of murder and mayhem, violence to a small town and the American dream family. There is plenty of casual married couple sex and along with a nice dose of humor in the more unexpected places.**SPOILER** The movie deals with the possibility of a person running and changing from the past and deals with it in a more serious and less stereotypical approach that makes Maria Bello's character all the more real and Viggo Mortensen performance all the more satisfying. Ed Harris does his creepy job while William Hurt's performance seems hurt from his type-casting and a less than mob-like acting. There are a few scenes, where Viggo is running home that seems a little far stretched and the character development of his son seems not to have been topped off considering the amount of screen time he has. Overall, this movie is refreshing, violent, foul mouthed, loud yet at the same time sensitive and tender with his hardened edges and family dynamics.

60,johnnyboyz,Interesting enough and nicely unfolded but you come away feeling the the blood and the maiming were given more attention than the pot-boiling the film should've developed.,7,18 March 2009,"The bulk of A History of Violence takes place in a location that is identified as ""A nice town, with nice people"" by its sheriff when he feebly tries to warn off Ed Harris' character, named Carl Fogarty, following a brief but menacing visit to the film's protagonist Tom Stall (Mortensen), from ever coming back again. Naturally, Carl isn't worried about what anyone has to say and goes and does what he pleases until he isn't required to do such things anymore. The truth is, it isn't a nice town and it's actually inhabited by rather a few people quite the opposite of 'nice' ranging from high school bullies, to professional thieves whom pass through robbing diners and places of business, to supposed former mob hit men operating under supposed false names. The assumption of the sheriff that it is a 'nice town' with 'nice people' is linked to the film's ambiguity for the best part: a statement or an assumption that something is most definitely matter-of-fact when really, it's quite the opposite.This statement is in reference to the film's overall ideas, pacing and general content. An assumption that it wants us to think it's one thing, before branching out into something else and then breaking off still to evolve and conclude as some kind of genre piece. I don't think it works overall, perhaps shamefully so, because I really felt there was good to be had out of the film. The film begins with two thieves lazily talking and hanging around outside a motel, before one of them enters the establishment and the camera briefly allows us a glimpse at a dead receptionist. Rather immediately, the film embeds an opinion of these two within the audiences mind that they're dangerous and not to be crossed without actually showing us an act of violence more-so the results of said event. The opening concludes with a rather shocking murder of a young girl which is tied in with a fast edit away from the action and a child's bedroom, forcing the audience into digesting what shocking events have just happened but with an actual image of a loving family huddled on a daughter's bed, in the next scene, happening many miles away.The family in question are the Stalls, the two adults of which own a diner in the 'nice town with nice people' in which they live; that being Millbrook. Tom has a wife, played by Maria Bello, called Edie and their children are Jack and Sarah. What we presume to be this side of the film is your everyday, bog standard suburban family with two kids of different genders; a son at school with a bullying problem and two responsible and in-love parents running their business and maintaining their nice, big house that they have. While that quaint little image of the American dream may induce vomiting amongst some, the film uses it as a fake-pleasant set up for things to come by branching off a mite and having Mortensen and Bello engage in an explicit sex scene which is a clear jump in content in regards what we've seen of this family so far. I think the point here is Cronenberg is saying on one hand, I've just given you a bit of a mushy, typical establishment but now we're going to branch off briefly and give you something explicit: or that things are not always what they seem.This idea echoes the narrative's one revelation; that Tom is not all what he seems and what he says and that there's something seedy going on when you pry. But for all the talk and sounding like it's a bit of a breakaway piece, the initial incident that brings an agent from the 'outside' of this world happens smack on twenty-five minutes; the standard time it takes for the initial incident to occur in most genre pictures. That being the robbery by the two thieves from earlier and the consequent arrival of Carl. The two thieves are persons that we really do fear now that this idyllic and somewhat perfect set up of seemingly nice people has been established. For the thieves to enter this life is genuinely scary and it culminates in the eliminating of them, something that is quite jarring in the sense the only two parties involved so far have been Stall's family and the robbers themselves  now we are only left with one.The next phase of the film is its best and even then, it doesn't really get above a certain level of either dramatic tension or general interest. It revolves around the idea of mistaken identity, or maybe it's just amnesia on Tom's behalf. Ed Harris gets to wear shades and talk about how he lost his eye, questioning both the audience and Tom's wife Edie whether or not this nice and seemingly perfect guy is really capable of these things. It's here we feel a shift in perspective, more over to Edie's side as we all struggle to work out what's true and what isn't. But then the fun ends and Tom's back-story is confirmed with the film evolving into a bunch of hard looking blokes shooting and maiming each other in different ways - that's it.It's interesting that the film moves away from Millbrook to induce these scenes but since Millbrook one of those towns you're born in/live in/die in  did no one figure that Tom may not be who he says he is because of his coming to town later on in years? Edie herself identified that they never knew one-another as teenagers. William Hurt pops up and gets an Oscar nomination for saying something like ""How do you screw that up?!"" and the conclusion is decidedly anti-climatic. It's not a bad film, it's just a little bit dressed up and, in one word, 'seductive'  very seductive film-making in its structure and ideas but quite anti-climatic in the end.",A History of Violence

I made the same mistake about American History X (and didn't learn from it, apparently) back in 1998, and while the movie is not about some sort of evolution of violence, as I assumed, there is an interesting paradox about violence that is approached. There is a short special feature on the DVD that shows a couple of scenes of violence that were different in the international version from the US version, because the blood had to be reduced for the US version. This struck me as quite odd because in the hour long documentary included on the DVD, Viggo Mortensen says that violence is sort of celebrated in America. Why is violence so celebrated in the same place where it is so heavily censored?At any rate, you know those crime movies and gangster movies where someone wants to get out of that life, do this one last job to make enough money to get out, and invariably someone tells them that they can't just leave? They can't just walk away? That's what this movie is about, it shows why you can't just walk away, because no matter how hard you try you can't change who you are. Viggo Mortensen plays Tom Stall, an unassuming café owner in a small, charming town, who lives a happy, simple life with his family, but which is entirely shattered when a couple of traveling criminals attempt to rob his store just before it closes one night. This leads on to a mysterious case of mistaken identity that gradually may or may not be mistaken, turning into an almost Hitchcockian thriller. (spoilers) Even when you learn what is really happening in the movie with the character of Tom Stall, it is clear that throughout the film he is always just trying to get back to the normal life he has been living in the small town of Millbrook. The movie makes a powerful statement about how hard it is to escape a life of crime, especially when you happen to be really good at it. Also of important note is the heavily meaningful ending, which I won't go into too much detail about because I don't fully understand it, but it is one of the most powerful scenes in the film, performance-wise, and it's amazing how much emotion it contains, given that not a word is spoken in the closing scene. Unusually powerful for such a violent thriller.",A History of Violence
65,Turfseer,Cheap Mafia stereotypes abound in this sordid tale of redemption,4,19 December 2009,"At the beginning of 'History of Violence', we meet two vicious killers who murder three people in a motel including a young child. Director Cronenberg immediately cuts to his protagonists, the Stall family, so I thought this was going to end up as another 'Desperate Hours', home invasion type of flick, with the bad guys invading the family home and perhaps terrorizing them or taking somebody hostage. Refreshingly, for a few moments at least, Cronenberg goes in another direction. The bad guys are dispatched by the principal protagonist, Tom Stall, played by Viggo Mortensen. It turns out that Stall has tried to erase his past life as Joey Cusack, a Mafia hoodlum, and has assumed a new identity in an idyllic Indiana town. But at the critical moment, while working at his place of business, a family diner, he's able to use his past skills as a made man and blows away the killers. As a result, he becomes an instant celebrity and becomes the subject of media scrutiny.Unfortunately, beyond this point, not a lot makes sense in this film. For starters, Cronenberg admits that the media scrutiny is only a local phenomena. The truth of the matter is that such a story would not remain a local event but would be covered nationally as well as on the internet. After Mafia boss Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris) shows up on the scene, folksy Sheriff Sam Carney does some 'research' to try and find out whether Fogarty is telling the truth that Tom has been leading a double life. For some reason, he's only able to find out about Mafia boss 'Ritchie'—there's no mention of Joey anywhere. Now why is that? A Google search would have certainly brought up information on the brother of a well known mobster such as Joey who police are aware ripped Fogarty's eye out. Furthermore, once the media found out about Tom the hero, there would have been intense scrutiny about his background leading to the discovery that Tom is not who he says he is.Now what about the ridiculous scene where Tom ends up seeing Fogarty's car and assumes it's heading out of town to his house to do harm to his family? Why does he start running all the way home? If he believed that the mobsters were going to hurt his family, wouldn't he have 1) called Sheriff Sam immediately and 2) grabbed a car or got one of his employees or friends to drive him home right away? Why do the mobsters attempt to induce Tom to come with them? He's standing right out on the lawn when Fogarty or one of his two henchmen could have went right up to him and shot him in the head? For that matter, if they wanted to, they could have killed the whole family right then and there.What exactly happened to Fogarty and his henchmen after Tom and Jack blow them away? We never see the police arrive and the bodies being taken away. Wouldn't there have been even more media interest which certainly would have led to the discovery that Tom was connected to the mobsters in the past? All we see is the Sheriff come over and make some meek inquiries as to Tom's background.While we find out next to nothing about Ed Harris's Fogarty, the same goes for brother Ritchie. They are both stereotypes of the typical Mafiosi. Cronenberg resorts to making Ritchie into a buffoon and admits that he didn't use a soundtrack during the climactic scene where Tom dispatches his brother and his minions in order to play up the comedy. Another stereotype is the school bully who is constantly harassing son Jack. How many times have we seen this type of character in poorly written films? Even worse, the bullying isn't even convincing (would a bully pick a fight just because a guy catches a baseball and the game is over?) In order to 'humanize' his principals, Tom and Edie, Cronenberg pads his film with overlong sex scenes. Worse is his obsession with showing all the blood and guts that are spilled whenever someone is shot. There's even an absurd 'DVD extra' which shows contrasting American and International versions of a scene focusing on the amount of blood that spurts out of a victim's mouth.While technically Cronenberg is a highly competent director who is able to get decent performances out of his actors, the script he's working with is amateurish. Ironically, History of Violence has little 'history' in it at all. Instead, it's a sordid tale of redemption in which a reformed man must defend himself against one-dimensional straw men who we neither care or know next to nothing about.",A History of Violence
66,freemantle_uk,A film of many themes,9,11 May 2008,"This is the second Cronenberg film I have seen and I have fought this film to be a very interesting and entertaining experience. A History of Violence is loosely based on the graphic novel by John Wagner. The plot of the film is Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen), is a family man, living in the Mid-West and owns a small diner. He is respected in his community and lives a conformable live-style. This all changes when two would-be robbers come into his diner late one night and try to steal the money and kill a woman. Tom was able to kill the robbers and become a local hero. However this brings unwanted attention and two gangsters from Philadelphia arrive and start calling him Joey Cusack. This starts to raise questions about Tom and his past. This leads to a number of confrontations with Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris), Richie Cusack (William Hurt) and even his own family.On one level A History of Violence is a gangster/crime film which in itself is very entertaining and well done. It is however, a very and small town live. psychological piece about how some can deal with a double identity and how it could affect his family. A movie about small town live and family relations, husband and wife and father and son. There is also the message about some trying to run away from his past and how that can't be possible and facing one's demons. The film also shows how tough Tom would have been and as the title suggest is a violence movie. There are some good scenes on that level. Cronenberg's direction was good and get the mood of the film write. There was also good casting in the film, especially from Viggo Mortensen who gives a good performance and avoids being type-casted after the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Ed Harris is very sinister in a subtle way in this film and William Hurt tends to give good performances.This movie is well worth watching.",A History of Violence
67,Polaris_DiB,Well enough done but not really interesting...,5,1 October 2005,"How one views a movie often deals with one's approach to the film. I made a mistake with this movie. I went in, having had difficulty securing a Cronenberg movie before, waiting to get an introduction to his style. I went in expecting, based on what I've heard about Cronenberg, a stylized film. I came in expecting a theme.I was mostly disappointed on all three marks. What I ended up with was a fairly straight-forward identity thriller, and that surprised me.Viggo Mortensen plays Tom Stall, a docile man in a docile world. Viggo Mortensen's style of acting, judging by Lord of the Rings, Hidalgo, and this film, is to whisper when he's getting dramatic. This works well with the film in that everyone in it is either just as docile as Tom, or trying to be smooth and stoic, which involves an outward appearance of docility. Tom Stall owns a café, has a good family, has no worries but that he can't get his truck started. Then some violent criminals decide to mess with his coworkers during closing, and he shows a side of himself nobody (in the film) expected: the ability to kill with relative ease. So thus the audience is in the search for his identity, who he is, and where he came from.This film started many things and decided to give them up. At first it seems a film to look into the undercurrent of violence in even the most domestic of communities. Then it seems to be a film of mistaken identity and bad fate. Then it just decides to be another story of a man escaping a past he didn't like, and finding out that he can't... as in, what we've seen many many times before.But it's a Cronenberg film. This means that it's stylized, interesting, and special, right? Honestly, I saw nothing in this film that struck me particularly as ""something only Cronenberg could do."" Sure, there's some pretty detailed gore effects, but they're sporadic, random, and worst of all, not needed for anything. Sure, there's some strange sexual encounters, but they don't really seem as anything except for sex, they don't develop the characters, they don't add anything to the story, they just exist in a sort of acceptable state of ""Well, might as well find a way to show these characters having sex."" They do reveal that Viggo Mortensen doesn't have that great of a body, if anybody cares about that.Speaking of the writing, indeed, it doesn't seem real care or interest was put into the script. Nothing particularly new is given us, the dialog could have been cut and pasted in any other movie of this genre, and the character development was, again, straight-forward and unappealing.As I mentioned before, I thought a large part of the lethargy in this film had something to do with the theme of violence as an undercurrent, but my mistake was thinking there was a theme. Even during moments when the action starts to pick up, it feels like the actors are really just sleep-walking through their roles. Only Ed Harris seemed to have any fun at all, everything else about this movie seems as though Cronenberg forced the cast and crew to stay awake for 24 hours before filming began to make everything seem lazy. Even the cinematography seems lazy after the wonderful long take at the beginning. However, stuff like the close-ups never really added to drama but more made me frustratingly want to take the director's chair and say, ""All right, move back a couple of feet, give us some room!"" It's not a bad film. It's just that the ending credits came up after an exhaustingly long ending sequence of no importance and I couldn't help asking, ""Oh? So what?"" This film is a good film to have some fun over the weekend with, but it's not really anything that can stick with you.--PolarisDiB",A History of Violence
68,dfranzen70,Almost misses the mark,6,21 February 2006,"The mild-mannered owner of a small-town diner foils an attempted armed robbery (not to mention potential rape and murder) and is immediately exulted as an angel of mercy, hero to the denizens of the placid burg. But it's soon obvious that there's more to Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) than meets the eye, particularly when three unsavory characters show up in his diner calling him ""Joey"" and alluding to a past in Philadelphia.David Cronenberg's latest is a mildly fascinating look at what can lie beneath a seemingly innocuous surface, but it turns out that those hidden layers are even shallower than the top one. Josh Olsen's screenplay doesn't invite close scrutiny, and his knack for crisp dialog is nearly nonexistent. Too often, events weren't trumpeted well ahead of time by loose writing.Mortensen is effectively earnest as Tom, and the ethereal Maria Bello is mostly perfect as his wife (she oscillates from subtle to hammy). Ed Harris is on hand as a one-eyed baddie who's after Tom. And William Hurt has a showy role as a mob big boss. Note that I said it was showy and not meaty; it's not a particularly interesting role, and Hurt seems out of place. Still, he managed to get his fourth Oscar nomination for the movie, which might be more of an indication of the weak supporting-actor field this time around.The movie seemed well cast - at least it wasn't miscast to the point where I noticed - and it moved along at a pretty quick clip. In retrospect, that seems a little strange, since there were tertiary story lines that simply didn't need to be explored. For example, Tom's son Jack (Ashton Holmes) is having trouble with a bully at school. Do we see that storyline somehow dovetailing with the main one? Nope, it's just there to toss in some gratuitous violence. Same with the sexcapades of Tom and Edie - yeah I know, a married couple, who knew - their games didn't necessarily add much to the plot, but they were a fun diversion.I do wish there'd been more depth given to the main characters, especially Tom. What's been his motivation? Why did he change? These questions are answered almost offhandedly, in a pat manner that won't satisfy most viewers. Why didn't Cronenberg explore these questions further? Instead, he padded the running time with sex and violence that, while entertaining, didn't do much to further the story. It's impossible to get into details about that, though, without ruining some of the plot.A History of Violence does grab you right away, but then it drops you, wanders aimlessly, then keeps you riveted for the final few scenes. Olsen's weak script is helped enormously by Mortensen and Bello, upon whom the bulk of the acting load rests - at least until Hurt chews the scenery. There's just enough intensity for the movie to work, although the final scene seems anticlimactic, indeed.",A History of Violence
69,dee.reid,"Cronenberg's endlessly and darkly seductive, dangerous, fascinating ""History""",9,3 October 2005,"The best thing to be said about ""A History of Violence"" is it keeps you watching. Canadian-born director David Cronenberg (""The Fly,"" ""Dead Ringers,"" ""Videodrome,"" ""Naked Lunch"") has yet to make a ""bad"" movie in his 20+ years as a provocative film-making auteur. His films educate, terrify, and move those willing to view them with an open mind. His most recent venture, ""A History of Violence,"" is the same. And ""A History of Violence"" has a commanding lead, Viggo Mortensen as Tom Stall, who becomes a local hero (think of him as a small-town Bernhard Goetz) after defending his diner from two would-be robbers.But that's not the end of it. For this film, Cronenberg takes a hard look at violence, and how our first hostile reactions to danger may not always be the correct ones. It's the innate human capacity for violence that stimulates Cronenberg (and perhaps it's almost necessary for survival, at least according to Social Darwinism), and his film dives deep into troubling, painful layers of emotion in his search.The film's opening scenes work to establish its simultaneous simplicity and complexity: at first, at least from this portion of the picture, the film appears to be benign in nature but then steadily moves into darker waters. Two unidentified individuals walk out of a motel. One of them, the older man, goes back in to check out. The younger man waits in the car and drives it to the front lobby. The older man comes out. A long, unbroken tracking shot follows the younger man as he walks inside to fill up an empty milk carton with water, and lying behind the counter are the bullet-riddled bodies of the owner and his wife.Then we're introduced to Tom Stall (Mortensen), his loving wife Edie (Maria Bello), and their children  teenage son Jack (Ashton Holmes) and young daughter Sarah (Heidi Hayes). Tom owns a well-respected business, a diner, and is admired by his fellow coworkers, friends, and neighbors. They are the perfect American family, living a perfect American life in a perfect vision of the American Dream in an all-American small town.Things take an ugly turn when the same two men from the opening scenes waltz into Tom's diner and attempt to stick it up. Thinking quickly, Tom smashes a coffee glass against the face of the older man, dashes over the counter, snatches his handgun, shoots the younger man, and then puts a bullet into the bleeding corpse of the older man on the floor.Cronenberg has never been one to spare us the gory details, and ""A History of Violence"" is no different. Just watch the grisly aftermath of the film's first violent encounter, and the camera doesn't flinch once in showing us the brutality of Tom's actions. Faces are mangled, bloodied  nothing is choreographed or stylized in any fashion and does not abide by any Hollywood standards. And sex is also seen as something of a grim fascination for Cronenberg as well and may be problematic for some. True, there are explicit sex scenes but I begin with assurances it's just simple sex; it's nothing to be really aghast at but Cronenberg likes to thoroughly explore it just as he does violence. Why, it's as close to ""mainstream"" cinema as Cronenberg may want to get.His rapid actions at an urgent moment become the focus of the rest of the film, as Tom is transformed into a local hero and is at least partially idolized because of his violent actions that faithful night. He's quick to not spend too much time in front of the cameras boasting and the business at his diner picks up considerably. He then earns status as a moderate celebrity.Another turn of events occurs when a mysterious group of men walk into Tom's diner one day. The first man, a disfigured suit named Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris) calls Tom ""Joey."" Tom, of course, doesn't know what he's talking about and assumes he is mistaken. But Fogarty insists Tom is someone else. The police become involved, Edie gets a restraining order against these out-of-towners, but their harassment is persistent, as they strongly believe Tom is not who he appears to be, and is perhaps linked to a shadowy figure in Philadelphia known as Richie Cusack (William Hurt). Has Tom been leading a life he desperately wants to keep hidden from his family and friends? Who was he before he came to this small town?It would appear on the surface that ""A History of Violence,"" Cronenberg's adaptation of a graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke, is a no-holds-barred thriller with wall-to-wall with action. I beg to differ. The film is unflinching in its scenes of action, which is true Cronenberg style if you've seen any of his past works. His film searches the deep, dark roots of human nature for reasons as to the dominance of violence in our first actions when threatened. When Jack is suspended from school for beating up a bully, Tom snaps at him, ""We do not use violence in this family!"" and Jack responds, ""No, we shoot them,"" and Tom slaps him across the face.That is the duality of this film: how we rely on our actions for survival and how we are quick to downplay the aftermath of them. Think about what happened in the wake of Hurricane Katrina a few weeks ago and we saw all the looting and wanton acts of violence of people just trying to survive. Now we were quick to denounce their actions but what if you were in their shoes? Would you be so fast to jump on the ""stop-the-violence"" bandwagon? Think about it, and then get back to me.Very seldom do we stop to think about our actions; I know I have. We must realize there is no action without consequence, and we must learn to live with them.9/10",A History of Violence

Viggo Mortensen gives a dynamic performance as Tom Stall, a small-town coffee shop owner who becomes a local hero when he salvages a few lives by demolishing two hardcore killers who tried to murder Tom and his ""Tom Tom Club"" employees & patrons at his café. Maria Bello executes another bellisima performance as Edie, Tom's wife who starts doubting his identity. Talk about your family identity crisis! Ashton Holmes work as Tom's son Jack is one of the best acting freshman efforts of the year. ""Tommy's Boy"" was P.H.A.T. (Pretty Honorable Acting Talent). Let's not forget Mr. Ed! Ed Harris was wonderfully haunting as Fogarty, the mysterious gangster who is convinced that Tom is really a former assassin from Philly named Joey. It also does not hurt for a veteran respected actor in William Hurt to make a scene-stealing cameo during the climatic portions of ""A History of Violence"". Writer Josh Olson's meticulous adaptation of ""A History of Violence"" will be volatile to other competing screenplay efforts during awards season. Director David Cronenberg, who has a history of orchestrating unconventional films, does masterful work in his most mainstream effort in ""A History of Violence"". I foresee a history of Oscar nominations for the aforementioned actors and filmmakers.

72,MaxBorg89,"David Cronenberg's ""Mainstream Movie""",10,18 December 2005,"On the surface, A History of Violence looks like a quite conventional thriller: based on a graphic novel, it's the story of a man who uses violence to protect himself and his family, only to have his past return and haunt him. How many action flicks or Westerns have a similar plot? Now, what makes this movie different is the director, David Cronenberg, whose filmography is all but mainstream so far (The Fly and Crash, anyone?). He uses the main plot to create a compelling, touching and sometimes disturbing reflection about identity, family and yes, violence, or rather the way it affects people. According to him, every single assault/murder in the film is defensible, and that's what makes it disturbing: the fact that we approve the characters'choices.At least, it's true when it comes to the event that unleashes the madness: Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen), a normal, calm family man, kills two blokes who were trying to rob his diner, and this makes him a (very) reluctant hero. But that's not the bad news. No, the bad news is Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris), a gangster from Philadelphia, thinks Tom is actually Joey Cusack, the man who gouged his eye out. From there on, everything goes bad, as Tom isn't trusted anymore, not even by his wife (Maria Bello) and kids, and has to deal with the painful situation all by himself.Cronenberg doesn't make it easy for his characters, and he doesn't judge them, letting the events speak for themselves. The violence is infrequent, but when it happens it's both quick and utterly realistic (the gore factor is very high, especially in the first half of the movie), so we can truly understand what it does to ordinary people. As for those who go through the whole thing, Mortensen and Bello are astoundingly real as the slowly unraveling couple, while on the bad guy front, Ed Harris and William Hurt (who plays Joey's brother Richie) are stereotyped but chillingly excellent.Behind its apparent simplicity, A History of Violence has many surprises, and it's with no doubt one of the year's best films.Probably as close to mainstream as Cronenberg can get...",A History of Violence
73,noralee,A Frank and Sophisticated Examination of the American Human,10,2 October 2005,"""A History of Violence"" is a fascinating and sophisticated examination of human nature (men and women), families, society and of how the movies have treated them. But the film is first and foremost a riveting story of full-bodied characters inhabited by enthralling actors enveloped by the sure hand of a sly director.The gliding camera is an ironic voyeur from the opening shots as director David Cronenberg gradually reveals his hand by widening our point of view, as the characters always know more than we do. So our emotional reactions will not just be to what we finally do see, but to how they have already reacted. Early on in the film when parents Viggo Mortensen and Maria Bello assure their awakened young daughter that there are no monsters in the light, we already know there are and they can even attack little girls. There are before and after twinned scenes throughout the film to show the impact of violence on their lives.It is also clear that this is much more than hidden ""The Bourne Identity"" glib entertainment situation as we see the explicit consequence of violence, but the trademark Cronenberg gore- oozing and splattered blood and sticky brain matter on faces, hands and clothes -- is in service to the story. (Several teen age boys in the audience were disappointed that there wasn't more though the grueling climax seemed to satisfy their blood lust.) Washing it off is a recurring re-purification. All these characters live in a very particular All-American context where violence lurks in our consciousness and a shotgun is in the closet. When the teen son tries to talk down bullies at high school (a bit too Seth Cohen-ish from ""The O.C."") we are already thinking of the roots of Columbine when two parallel sets of bullies briefly collide. A frequent admonishment about using barbed wire as a weapon has many contextual resonances.Appearances matter and role-playing is treated seductively at first in the parents' passionate relationship. He gratefully recalls how she's looked at him and ironically teases ""Who are you and what have you done with my wife?"" when she recreates high school. But it's shortly her turn to query her husband ""Who are you?"" Key to the film's believability is Mortensen's richly and complexly masculine performance. He had kept us guessing, but in a key scene he converts right on the screen, with his eyes changing from kindly to piercing, to his increasingly confident, lanky body language, then he breathes a recall of being born again in the desert, like John the Baptist. though only temporarily into a ""Stall"" because that's what was available. He looked so at home in rural Indiana, but as he heads to a confrontation in the cradle of liberty, Philadelphia, where the second amendment protecting the right to bear arms was drafted, he suddenly looks like an out-of-place farmer and we realize this struggle is as primal as Cain vs. Abel, even as the banter references the ambitions of the American Dream. This is mythic stuff, but still unpredictable. (I haven't read the graphic novel that the film is based on to know if anything has been changed.)When his inner emotions explode, almost like Jet Li in ""Unleashed,"" he reaches for his wife's Achilles heel and brings her down in a chilling take on the romantic scene from the coming-of-age ""Risky Business"" to leave open issues of links between sex and violence. When the family is torn by confusion, the son is perplexed about expectations that draw on gangster movies as a vocabulary.Mario Bello tries to downplay her beauty and is very intense as she literally has to bare all. Her character is no June Cleaver stereotype but a tough lawyer. An indication of how good Cronenberg is with the actors is Kyle Schmid who has a tiny role as the high school bully but is very effective here compared to how he had nothing to work with in the recent dreadful teen TV soap ""Beautiful People.""Like other films based on graphic novels, such as ""Road to Perdition"" and ""Sin City,"" the nemeses and the production design are very strong. Ed Harris and William Hurt clearly enjoy chewing the scenery as villains that are atypical for them. The conclusion seems like a Voltarian coda of cultivating one's garden in the primacy of defense of the family unit but they will surely have to live with the consequences of what they have learned about themselves. While this has some feel in common with a ""Twilight Zone"" episode, it trumps Lars von Trier's didactic screeds against America and Gus van Sant's dreamy meditations on death by achieving its revelations through the power of cathartic storytelling. I look forward to seeing it again.",A History of Violence

75,EVOL666,Cronenberg Is Still At The Top Of His Game...,9,27 March 2006,"I gotta say, I dug the hell out of this one. Cronenberg has done some really great films in his day (THE BROOD, VIDEODROME, SHIVERS, DEAD RINGERS, SCANNERS, to name a few...) and has done a few that I wasn't so into (CRASH, and SPIDER being the first that come to mind...), but even though A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE does have the ""Cronenberg-touch"" on it, I think those that may not like his previous works could still get into this film. This film is a lot more straight-forward than his previous, more surreal films, which may appeal to more ""mainstream"" audiences. But it still has the ""dark-cloud"" over it that definitely stamps it as a Cronenberg film.Tom Stall and his family live in a rural town where Tom owns a restaurant. Two criminals come in to rob the restaurant, and Tom dispatches them in pretty calm and methodical fashion. Afterwards, Tom is the town hero, but his heroic actions draw the unwanted attention of some out-of-town tough-guys. It seems that the head tough-guy thinks that Tom is actually someone named Joey, who apparently has some unfinished mob-business back in Philadelphia. Tom denies any connection to this ""Joey"" person...but the toughs aren't so easily placated. When the tough-guys start threatening Tom and his family and pushing the issue of Tom's mob involvement - it's time for Tom to push back, and the results ain't pretty...A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE works on several different levels, as an action film, a story of family, a tale of repentance and forgiveness, and a portrayal of revenge. The acting is rock-solid all the way through and there are some very tense scenes in the build-up of the story. Cronenberg's direction is as sure and strong as always, and his ""style"" is very apparent, even if a little understated compared to his older works. The way he tends to linger on the more ""unpleasant"" or ""intimate"" scenes is definitely a staple of his works, along with the unflinching violence that is portrayed throughout. Another winner from an overall winning director. Definitely recommended - 9/10",A History of Violence
76,Kdosda_Hegen,Too much of an action movie.,4,14 May 2020,"The idea is a drama, but the violence is pure oldschool action. I loved the action scenes, but they failed their own message. They try to claim that violence is bad, but in this movie it looks so awesome and it solves all the problems, that It feels like an opposite message instead.",A History of Violence
77,EUyeshima,Gripping Meditation on Violence Superbly Rendered by Cronenberg and Stellar Cast,9,22 March 2006,"For the melodramatic premise it looks like it's going to present, this movie shouldn't have worked. But leave it to veteran director David Cronenberg to defy expectations and capture lightning in a bottle with a searing exploration of violence and duplicity. The movie opens with a chilling scene of the aftermath of a harshly bloody act that leads inevitably to another shocking act, but then it shifts gears to a pastoral, Thornton Wilder-like town. The story then focuses on Tom Stall, an upstanding citizen and owner of the local diner. He's been happily married for twenty years to Edie, still a knockout and now a successful lawyer, and they have two children. An unexpected incident in the diner makes Tom a media hero much to his chagrin, and it also brings the attention of some obvious mobsters who think Tom is someone else.While the vigilante set-up sounds like a tribute to the Warner Brothers film noir crime drama of the 1940's, the 2005 film is surprisingly a thoughtful and downright chilling meditation on the causes of violence and the unexpected, almost inevitable ramifications. To say anything more would ruin the plot, but suffice it to say that the movie haunts and resonates with flashes of unflinching violence that only Cronenberg can do graphically without being gratuitous. The foreboding title signals the necessity of the violence, though the shots are relatively subdued from the man responsible for the memorable head explosions in 1981's ""Scanners"" and the gooey transformation in the 1986 update of ""The Fly"".A gallery of superb performances brings out the wired intensity of the characters starting with the always underrated Viggo Mortenson who is ideally cast as Tom. Looking almost like Gary Cooper but with a dark edge, Mortenson powerfully plays the role right on the balance between decency and denial. Even more impressive is Maria Bello, who simply electrifies as Edie especially as the revelations transform her existence. The stairway scene with Mortenson and Bello elicits a visceral energy that scorches the screen. Ashton Holmes is terrific as their teenage son Jack, who unexpectedly taps into his own anger with a high school bully.In smaller parts that sometimes threaten to broaden toward stereotype, Ed Harris taps into the feral side of his screen persona as Carl Fogarty, a one-eyed mobster who is convinced he knows Tom, and a surprisingly ferocious William Hurt holds his ten minutes of screen time as Richie Cusack, as he provides the key to the unraveling plot. Based on a graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke, the film is ultimately a parable about violence as much as Paul Haggis's ""Crash"" (not Cronenberg's film with the same title) is a parable about racism. However, the major difference is that Cronenberg and screenwriter Josh Olson do not layer contrivances to hammer down on obvious points in their story, and the ending is effectively and hauntingly open-ended. This is a gripping cinematic work strongly recommended.The DVD package is excellent with one of the best making-of documentaries I have seen for a major release, an hour-long feature called ""Acts of Violence"". It is divided effectively in eight acts with particularly thoughtful comments from Cronenberg, Mortenson and Bello. Cronenberg also provides terrific commentary on an alternate audio track, and there are actually two extras related to a deleted fantasy scene that reflects the more typically gory side of Cronenberg's style. The only feature of lesser interest is a featurette tracking the film to the Cannes Film Festival.",A History of Violence
78,fertilecelluloid,Predictable material redeemed by unique directorial vision,8,18 March 2006,"A good example of how a director with a unique vision can make predictable material special. Top notch performances help, too. The film is paced like Lynch's ""Lost Highway"" and concerned with behavior, not plotting. Originality is not its selling point. Viggo Morstensen plays an unassuming husband and store owner who commits a shocking act of violence while defending his life and that of an employee. His ""heroic"" act attracts the attention of Philadelphia mobsters. Working from Josh Olson's spare screenplay, David Cronenberg fashions a series of uneasy, tension-laden scenes in which the true nature of the protagonist is subverted. Not as focused on ""body horror"" as previous Cronenberg works, there is, nevertheless, a raw, disturbing quality to the violence and a truthful portrayal of violent consequences. Mortensen undergoes a subtle transformation as the pivotal character, and Maria Bello is superb as the strong wife faced with the challenge of accepting her husband's past and what that implies about her present. Two powerful sex scenes cleverly convey the shifting nature of the couple's relationship. For me, a return to form for the great Canadian director after the anaemic ""Spider"" and the remote ""Existenz"".",A History of Violence
79,Jonny_Numb,"Cronenberg's evolution of ""Violence""",8,16 October 2005,"Going out to the movies these days is something of a gamble--sure, we have the Cingulair-sponsored ""Silence Cell Phones"" message before the feature begins, but we are defenseless against vocal patrons who believe their narration or editorial comments actually carry a bit of entertainment value (during a poor film, such an action can be refreshing; to those who cannot handle a deliberately-paced, serious film, it's downright irritating). If the writings of Plato had been taken seriously and enforced to this day, a Philosophical Elite would be the only audience for ""A History of Violence,"" David Cronenberg's stunning study of identity.But perhaps I'm being a bit harsh and fascistic. After all, we pay the same absurd matinée price to get in, and it is at our own risk that we get stuck two rows in front of vocal adults with Attention Deficit Disorder. Yet at the same time, whenever a loud laugh is uttered at a bully calling a defenseless boy ""faggot"" or declaring a man with half his face blown off ""yummy,"" ""A History of Violence"" is not only revealing toward the potential for brutality of its characters, but also the dormant appetites of its audience, exhibited for all to see. In this regard, Cronenberg's film probes deeper than the ""mob-procedurals"" of Scorsese and Tarantino, maturely addressing issues of identity, heroism, and denial, while holding up a mirror to how his audience reacts. In my eyes, ""History"" is a film--like Larry Clark's ""Bully""--awash in unpleasant violence that shows just how instinctual, savage, and ugly violence really is.Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) plays a small-town diner owner married to Edie (Maria Bello), a successful lawyer; they have two ideal children, and life, as they say, ""is good."" All that changes when two thugs hold up the diner and are murdered with shocking efficiency by Tom; this inspires a media whirlwind and the arrival of the menacing, understated Carl Fogarty (a brilliant Ed Harris), who insists Tom is really Joey Cusack, a gangster who once operated out of Philadelphia. As Tom's demeanor begins to shift and his identity is called into question, the behavior of his family becomes just as inclined toward surprising acts of brutality, to the point where we wonder if violence is trait that can be so easily spread from father to son to wife to daughter. Watching the subtle changes in character that occur during ""History"" make the experience that much more deeply felt.Cronenberg is a director who has long been known for his wild ventures into the body's capacity for mutation (the sex maniacs of ""Shivers""; a decaying Jeff Goldblum in ""The Fly""; vaginal stomach-slits in ""Videodrome""), but since 1997's ""Crash,"" his films have developed into more controlled, psychologically adventurous pieces (""Spider"" being his most divergent effort); ""A History of Violence"" is no exception. In a film that juxtaposes the intimate ""family dynamic"" of both small-town life and the criminal underworld, it is hard to not be affected by the way in which the dominoes ultimately fall. The director also shows a knack for adapting to a very streamlined story while maintaining the flair for the unexpected that he's built his career on.Wrought with grace and skill and filled with superb performances, ""A History of Violence"" demonstrates not only David Cronenberg's thrilling evolution as a filmmaker, but also creates a portrait of physical and psychological brutality that will only leave the most ignorant of viewers unscathed. One of the year's best films.",A History of Violence
80,ShootingShark,Small Town Joe Vs Bigshot Gangsters Identity Drama,7,29 June 2006,"Tom Stall owns a diner in a small town, but when it is held up at gunpoint he turns the tables and kills the gunmen. He is hailed as a hero by the community, but this notoriety brings unwanted attention from some unsavoury Philadelphia gangsters, and Tom's wife begins to suspect her husband's past may not be quite what it seems ...A welcome critical and commercial success for the great Canadian director Cronenberg, this is slightly atypical of his movies in that he did not write it and it's a fairly simple, straightforward story, devoid of his trademark existential and biological themes. The characters are a little one-dimensional (it was adapted from a graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke) but the quiet, restrained pacing and unfiltered style give the actors plenty of room to emote. The key role is of course Tom, and Mortensen is an effortless strong silent type, but I'm not quite sure I buy him as a reformed killer. Harris and Hurt (the former with a terrific scarface makeup) have fun as a couple of bigshot hoodlums, but the best performance is by the talented Bello as Tom's bewildered wife Edie. She is strong, evocative, sexy, confused and frightened, sometimes all at the same time, and her earthiness and metamorphosing relationship with a husband it turns out she doesn't really know is what gives the movie a real kick. This is a film about the effects of violence, rather than a violent film, and Cronenberg excels at transposing a pulp-fiction gangster narrative into a bucolic, tranquil, everyday setting. It's also a refreshingly open movie in moral terms; the actions of its hero are neither condoned nor championed, but simply presented, and the concluding question of whether the family should welcome Tom back is subtly left unanswered. Set in Indiana, but shot in Cronenberg's homeland Ontario and featuring great film-making by his usual crew (Ronald Sanders, Howard Shore, Carol Spier and Peter Suschitzky), this is a terrific little psycho-drama that does its title justice and packs a real wallop.",A History of Violence
81,truemythmedia,A Thriller with Smoldering Intensity,8,8 August 2019,"A History of Violence is an underrated gem, one that was mildly successful thanks to the built in fan base due to the source material (it's based on the graphic novel of the same name), but it definitely deserved more attention at the time of its release. The message is an important one, one that many people are afraid to ask themselves; are we naturally violent people? So to watch Tom Stall battle this, it feels all too real with the world around us today, and Cronenberg really nails it with this interpretation. The performances are top notch, everyone brings all their cards to the table, and with such a prolific director behind the camera, who wouldn't want to give it their all. The writing is a bit odd, especially in the first act, besides the opening scene the first twenty minutes are just too melodramatic with clunky dialogue, it takes a few minutes for this to take off, but it's such a brisk runtime it's easy to forgive, because when the violence starts, it never stops. At it's core it's a family drama of survival, and finding out who their father truly is, all the questions are answered in satisfying ways, David Cronenberg never let's up on the intensity during the second and third acts, which almost forgives the stale first act. The film would have benefited from a longer script, as some moments are a tad rushed, it would've been nice to spend a little longer with the characters. But that being said overall, ""A History of Violence"" is above par entertainment, and despite it's flaws it's an important piece of filmmaking, one that only further improved the director's already impressive career.",A History of Violence
82,vertigo_14,An insulting pseudo-thriller. (spoilers),1,14 December 2005,"We saw this movie in a theater with just four others. And, as the emotional dinner table resolution started to lag into five minutes of lots of cutting back with zero dialog, I groaned rather loudly, ""when is thing going to end already?"" That's about the point where, almost reluctantly, the credits roll and someone called out, ""Worst movie ever!"" Indeed. You might usually expect movies of such a low-entertainment caliber from the catalog of either super patriotic action films, corny family flicks, or some of the garbage chick flicks. Here, the talents of all its major actors--Viggo, Maria Bello, Ed Harris, and William Hurt are ultimately wasted in this piece of cinematic crap.The story involves a mild mannered, babyfaced Viggo as a smalltown diner owner named Tom Stall. (Curiously, he nearly perfectly resembled Steven Zahn, especially when he says to his wife in one of many overlong and annoying timed raunchy sex sequences, ""you're naughty."") The little town of Middlebrook, Indiana is suddenly rocked from its sleepy routine when two city thugs show up to the diner causing trouble and Tom, the surprising hero, shoots them dead. Only the unfortunate and unwanted publicity it brings Tom, his family, and the town also forces into Tom's life some folks from his past that he had been trying to long forget. And the bulk of the film is Tom both tying up lose ends and trying to get on with starting over.As another viewer had already stated, the title might imply some kind of philosophical purpose (especially if you consider the roles Viggo and Ed Harris have taken in the past, you might expect such a purpose). The first few minutes of the film may likewise imply tasty action (but unconventionally gory, at least for this kind of movie). Although, despite these expectations, it fails to deliver. The trouble only in part lies in the story itself, which in the beginning may be enticing as you hope the secrets being uncovered lead to something quite good. Certainly, that's what the persistence of Ed Harris' strange character might have you believe. But, the bigger difficulty with this movie is two-fold. One is the shoddy storytelling that becomes wholly too unrealistic as much as it becomes forced such as the situation with the annoying jock bothering Tom's son, for example. Or Tom's wife who, when she becomes aware of his secret, tries to escape him in the house, then they get into a fist fight, and then they have violent sex. The viewer may be confused, except for the ones who find the sex scenes to be the only appeal to this ridiculous film.It might have been intentional that we are never sure whether we want the protagonist Tom to find the fate of most violent, deceptive characters (which is usually death) or whether we want to sympathize. He doesn't make it easy to decide. This was at least an interesting way of tricking the viewer who may try to predict what would happen to Tom as the film went along.The other problematic element here is the acting. I was particularly annoyed by the efforts of Ashton Holmes who, was presumably a miscast, and comes off as an incredible nerd rather than the sincere, but distraught teenage son of Tom. It was probably accurately suggested that by the end of this story, culminating in a truly unbelievable climax, William Hurt was trying hard to emulate the cool of Gary Oldman's performance in 'The Professional.' In the end, save the first moments of real action that take place in the diner, the events of the film not only move so swiftly as to disallow the viewer any time to reflect, but they fail to lead to anything truly interesting. Movies like this, at least where they do not take the philosophical route, should at least deliver interesting moments of action in which the protagonist is initially innocent and trying to remain so, or, as in this film, he is trying to establish a new plane of innocence to adhere to.But, whatever the case, I would agree with my fellow theater patron. This was one of the worst movies.",A History of Violence
83,ctomvelu1,He-man extraordinaire,8,6 October 2009,"Keeping in mind the movie was based on a comic book or graphic novel, VIOLENCE plays out pretty well. It intersperses scenes of small-town America and family life with incredible outbursts of killing. Viggo M. plays a Wisconsin diner owner who is actually a former Philly mobster. A bloody altercation with two gangsters in the diner puts the shy diner owner on the front page and draws the attention of his brother (William Hurt), a mob boss back in Philly. Hurt sends a trio of killers after his long-missing brother, one of whom, played by Ed Harris, lost an eye to Viggo's character years before. The action scenes are extremely well-staged and brutal as all hell. The family scenes are note-perfect and include two adults-only sex scenes between Viggo and the very sexy Mario Bello, who plays his unsuspecting wife. Your tolerance for this will depend on your tolerance for extreme violence, a word that is prominently featured in the title, after all. I originally saw this in the movies and have a review of it elsewhere here. A repeat viewing today on TV shows it has lost none of it impact.",A History of Violence
84,rosscinema,Provoking film achieves it's purpose,8,2 October 2005,"After reading both user comments and critics reviews it's obvious that this is one of those films that will divide audiences but like everything else that has happened in my life I lie somewhere in the middle. Some critics have publicly stated that this is one of the best films of the year but while I think that point is pretty arguable I do think that any film that can cause so many heated debates warrants a viewing and easily gets a recommendation from me. Story is about Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) who lives in a small town in Indiana running a diner and living a nice quiet life with his lawyer wife Edie (Maria Bello) and their two children. One day two thugs enter the diner and threaten the lives of everyone but Tom (unexpectedly) springs to life and kills them both which makes him a darling of the media and has his face plastered on every newscast on television.*****SPOILER ALERT***** One day three mysterious strangers show up at the diner headed by a badly scarred Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris) and they waste no time in stating that Tom is actually a gangster from Philadelphia named Joey Cusack who disappeared almost 20 years ago. Tom denies the allegations but Fogarty and his men won't go away and when his family is threatened he ends up killing them at his home in a bloody confrontation. Tom finally comes clean about his past with his family and they don't know how to react to this shocking news but when his gangster brother Richie (William Hurt) calls it becomes obvious that things won't be getting any better until he finally puts an end to things.Love him or hate him I have always been a big David Cronenberg admirer and even his most avant-garde efforts (Crash, eXistenZ) were interesting affairs and I think this is easily one of his better films. Cronenberg has shown that he's attracted to stories about characters who dwell in the shadows of reality and time and one of his gifts as a director comes from the fact that he never pulls any punches with his characters which allows for plenty of interpretation in terms of their actions. The sex scene on the stairwell for example has been called by many as gratuitous and unnecessary but I disagree because I had a feeling that it's shown for two reasons and the first has to do with the correlation between sex and violence and the adrenalin rush that both Tom and Edie were feeling at that time while the second reason has to do with Edie having sex for the first time with Joey after his real identity has been admitted. The script asks so many pertinent questions about violence such as it's importance in settling issues and disputes and one of the answers might be that it's acceptable (and unavoidable) during certain instances. One of the other interesting aspects of the story has to do with Tom's teenage son Jack (Ashton Holmes) who after discovering the truth about his father finds something in himself to justify his reaction to the school bullies and this leads to more questions about whether violence is either hereditary in some manner or just part of nature that we all have inside of us. Cronenberg doesn't use violence as a metaphor but instead uses it as the central piece for the actions of the characters and if you have to simplify what exactly the point is I think it has to do with the fact that violence is at times unavoidable but is also something that everyone has to learn to live with on some level. Okay, so many people hate this film but I came away thinking that it accomplished exactly what it set out to do and in this day and age of unimaginative and predictable Hollywood tripe I get on my knees and thank God that there are filmmakers like Cronenberg who still challenge audiences.",A History of Violence

86,nycritic,Something Wicked This Way Comes: A Man's Past,10,11 April 2006,"David Cronenberg at first glance doesn't seem to be a director one would link to the subject matter of A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE in which a man's past comes to haunt him. Building upon themes of internal physical corruption, he has made stories of the grotesque an art form even while they all retain a sense of detachment.The key words being grotesque and corruption, he in fact follows on these themes and bends them to the characters' psyches and implicit genetic legacy, all the while painting a picture of an idealistic Americana that would not be out of place in a Frank Capra film or ""Leave it to Beaver"". Tom Stall is the Jimmy Stewart of the film, a quiet, soft-spoken man who runs a diner with pride and joy and is the head of the near-perfect household. Up until when the story begins with a foreshadowing of ""Something Wicked this way Comes"" under the guise of two mercenary killers, the only smear in this family is a recurring issue oldest son Jack is having at school under the harassment of bullies. It's when these two killers come to town and descend upon Stall's diner demanding coffee -- but really looking for trouble since this is their modes of sport -- that Tom, in a moment of apparent self-defense, single-handedly takes both men out. Townsfolk are in awe and grant him due deference, but the media -- not surprisingly -- is the cause that unsettling men are now entering town wanting to have a little more than words with Tom.It's here when A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE changes from a sleepy story into something much more menacing. Because these men -- among them Carl Fogerty with a disfigured eye and loads of disturbing information about the man they call Joey Cusack -- are the kinds that no one in their right minds would consider messing with, Tom's circle of action becomes smaller and smaller. Edie, his wife who despite it all stands by him, begins to wonder. Then the horrifying truth comes out and when Fogerty has decided to settle some matters with Tom, Joey suddenly makes his appearance, and then Jack also comes out, saving Tom's life. It's here when the family as a nucleus begins a slow disintegration: how Tom's past as Joey threatens to break them apart. Cronenberg never gives us too much information on what exactly did Joey/Tom do, but it's suspected that he could have been a contract killer. Later on, a fateful meeting with his brother Richie discloses that he was a ""wild one"" and had ""cost Richie money"" and had to, therefore, be terminated.Here Cronenberg raises an interesting question: is violence genetic? In Cronenberg's world, it is. A proclaimed Darwinist, he presents a world where only the strongest will survive, and if violence is the only way out, then so be it. Jack, not a kid one would link to be aggressive, is pushed to the limit when a bully and his gang descend on him over and over again. It's only when that limit crossed when Jack makes a 180 degree turn and lands the bully in the hospital. Richie discloses he tried to kill Joey as a baby but failed and got a memorable beating from his mother. A chilling sequence in which Edie decides to stand by Joey, then physically confronts him, leads to a sequence resembling more rape than lovemaking and has overtones of the violent Joey sneaking out to grab her throat and throttle her. It's as if there were a Jekyll-Hyde element to Tom the good natured fellow battling against the killing machine known as Joey. These are images that are not the ones the people of Mayberry would approve of, but what Cronenberg is showing is our own nature -- that we, as a culture, are violent, prone to inhumanity, but as in the final closing scene, also worthy of a second chance.A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE may well be Cronenberg's more well-rounded achievement in presenting horror not of the body but of the soul. Viggo Mortensen's light physique and introspective face serves his character's deceptive nature: you believe him as Tom Stall, but you also believe him when he becomes Joey Cusack with nary a special effect to be seen. Maria Bello, an actress I had not consciously been familiar with, is a strong foil to Mortensen: her character has a moral ground, that of maintaining her family intact when Tom's past threatens to rip it apart. Ed Harris makes creepy just a word: this is one nasty troll of a man out for revenge. And in a small part, Willian Hurt looks as bizarre as any character out of a David Lynch drama -- disquieting, a little funny, but dangerous all the way. One of the top movies of 2005 and a disturbing look at the loss of innocence once our nasty deeds come to light.",A History of Violence

The film was working well to this point, but once these mafia guys came in his property, it started going downhill.The guys show up in his gate house after some previous death threats, and the wife instead of calling 911, just stay inside of the house looking by the window while her husband is possibly about to be murdered.

90,brando647,A Powerful Film from David Cronenberg Based on Graphic Novel,8,24 January 2010,"Fans of John Wagner and Vince Locke's graphic novel be warned: director David Cronenberg and screenwriter Josh Olson take creative license with their film adaptation. Cronenberg's film carries a different focus but maintains the same basic storyline and characters as the popular novel. In small-town Millbrook, IN, diner owner Tom Stall kills a couple of psychopaths during an attempted robbery and attracts national attention as a hero. This brings unwanted attention from a couple of Mafiosos having seen Tom in the news; they believe Tom isn't who he says he is and have come seeking retribution for the past. Now Tom's life is thrown into turmoil as his family copes with the possibility that the man they've known for twenty years may not be who he says he is.The primary difference between the novel and the film is the focus Cronenberg places on the family's suffering over the course of events. In the novel, the plot concentrates on how Tom does what he has to do to put an end to the history that has caught up with him, and the violence of the novel is much more constant and brutal. Cronenberg decides to explore how the events change Tom's family, with his wife Edie conflicted with the knowledge that she's never truly known her husband of 20 years and son Jack dealing with a bully at school. The pacing of the film is slow and deliberate as opposed to the fast-pacing of the novel, but it works well with the character-driven story.The cast in this film, shines with few exceptions. Viggo Mortensen does a phenomenal job as Tom Stall, whom we see slowly shift personalities over the course of the film. The beautiful Maria Bello is a great supporting addition as wife Edie, and one of the best performances in the film comes in the form of Ed Harris as Carl Fogarty, the scarred mobster who wanders into town to find Tom following the events. Harris's arrogance and humor are probably my favorite portions of the movie. The only weak spot in the film is, oddly enough, William Hurt. Hurt doesn't arrive in the film until the final act and he's received plenty of critical praise for his performance, but I wasn't as impressed. His Philadelphia accent and odd line delivery made him more amusing than threatening so I couldn't take the final confrontation with any weight behind it. Regardless, it's a minor complaint against an entertaining and emotional film.",A History of Violence

Potent action-noir is not for the faint of heart, but superlative performances (particularly Bello, as the conflicted wife, and Hurt, cast against type in a brief but showy role) and quirky Cronenberg's no-nonsense approach that camouflages darker, more daring subversions in the material deliver the goods. Though the plot is fairly straightforward in development and articulation, the character work and shocking explosions of violence (uneasily multi-faceted, the both) are what make this one of the top thrillers of its time.

This is really just another tale about ""violence chic"", but with high pretensions. You're supposed to think this is also a drama about grown-ups. I don't think so.Viggo Mortensen hasn't had 1 expression in his face in any movie I've seen. Here he's got at least 0,8, but that's not enough. The story is about revenge. Yes, I know the old Greeks had the same theme in their tragedies, but the people there are interesting and intelligent, not like those in this movie. In Greek tragedies you know that there ARE such folks. There has never been people like those who are with Cronenberg.Quite overestimated picture.",A History of Violence

95,DeeNine-2,Beware of people in black Cadillac Escalades,7,5 March 2007,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)""Horror-meister"" David Cronenberg (AKA ""King of Venereal Horror,"" or ""the Baron of Blood"") began directing movies in the sixties, mostly made-for-TV fare, and then moved to the big screen in the seventies with some forgettable scifi/horror flicks. But then in the eighties he perfected his art (if you can call it that: I prefer to call it ""the cynical seduction of the audience by playing upon their worse fears,"" but, hey, I never had to make a living in filmland) with e.g., Scanners (1981), The Fly (1986), Dead Ringers (1988), etc. Here he settles for plain, ordinary two-fisted psycho/mobster/killer-type violence.Viggo Mortensen stars as Tom Stall who runs a diner in a small midwestern town, a likable guy with a wife Edie (Maria Bello) and two kids. He's just your average joe until one day some cold-blooded killers visit his diner and decide to rape and pillage. Tom manages to take their guns from them and shove them...uh, send them to meet their maker in a bit of surprising heroics that draws the attention of some mobsters from Philadelphia. They apparently think Tom is a onetime mobster/hit man named Joey Cusack who had done them some grievous harm in the past. They want revenge. The question is, have they got their man or is this a tragic case of mistaken identity? Interesting premise.(Possible spoilers to come, so proceed at your own risk.) There is one thing wrong with this movie and that is the adamant reaction of Tom Stall's family when they learn the truth. I can't say more without revealing too much plot detail, but for those who have seen the movie, you may know what I am saying. His family, regardless of what they learned, could not help but be one hundred percent on his side. The most they should have said is, ""You should have told us"" and yet even that is too much. They should come to the realization of what kind of man he is as the audience does, slowly and only after the final scenes. This is the kind of cinematic mistake that directors sometimes make. They are completely familiar with the material. They know how it ends and so they sometimes put their characters in the frame of mind that their characters would have if their characters knew everything the director knew. But Edie and the kids did not know who their father really was even after the scene when the black Cadillac Escalade pulls up into their yard. I know if my spouse or father had been such a good man for so many years, I would not turn on him just because he kicked a bit too much tail a bit too successfully, especially when saving other people's lives.Otherwise this is a kind of brilliant movie. The ending is perfect. The psychology is straight out of evo psych; a kind of forbidden truth is told on several levels, and when all is said and done, the little girl goes and gets the plate and the silverware, and the son passes the roast to his father. What else is there to be done? One can imagine that this is how it is and has been for tens of thousands of years in the household of the warlord, the house of the man who managed to survive--never mind how. Such is the nature of human beings.There are a couple of very true to life sex scenes in this movie that will be too much for people who have cliché ideas about sex or like to kid themselves a lot. Again those of you who have seen the movie will know what I am talking about: well, the one in which Edie says we never experienced high school together is one of them. The scene on the staircase is the other. They are both well done.The redeeming factor for the hero is that we never see him do anything except in self-defense. He has an amazing ability to protect himself and to put those who attack him out of their misery. It's almost comic book, cowboy movie quality. Yet I think Cronenberg made it so realistic that you almost believe it could happened. Mortensen's character is part of the hero/superman/ninja/two-fisted/John Wayne type of guy who can win a barroom fight against a half dozen other men, a guy who can beat a trio of armed toughs, stripping them of their weapons and using them against them because he is quicker and more deadly. A nice bit of supporting psychology is all of the business with the son and the school bully. The way the son handles him actually supports the violent-hero mythology: like father, like son. It's in the blood.The title of the film suggests a documentary. But if you think instead about something that somebody would say about an individual's past you'll see that the title is apt.Nice supporting work by Ed Harris and William Hurt. But let's face it, this is an R-rated movie without much in the way of redeeming social value, and is in fact a very nice seduction of its targeted audience, which is what one would expect from Cronenberg.",A History of Violence
96,DJAkin,Viggo delivers the goods,7,27 April 2006,"I enjoyed this movie. It was very good. There was a lot of suspense, that's for sure. Viggo is a small town cafe owner who turns out to get robbed by some ruthless jerks/killers. That one killer really got mad when Viggo would not provide him with coffee. The mean killer just shouted COFFEE!! Little did they realize that Viggo was actually very good at fighting and killing himself. That's where the movie takes a good turn. The mobster played by the amazing Ed Harris was interesting. He did very well with that accent. I also noticed that Viggo's accent occasionally came out when he was Joey. William Hurt was good in this movie even though it was a very small part. All in all, a great movie.",A History of Violence
97,sme_no_densetsu,Not quite one for the history books but pretty good nonetheless,7,21 January 2008,"Some of my favorite movies deal with organized crime so it's nice to see somebody take a fresh approach, especially when it's backed up by storytelling that's based closer to home. That being said, while this movie is better than most of it's brethren, it isn't exactly flawless.For one thing, the cast isn't top-notch; more like a notch below top-notch. Ed Harris is excellent, as always, though. Strangely, William Hurt got an Oscar nom for his role, which I thought was nothing special.Similarly, I don't see why Cronenberg's direction gets such plaudits, but that may just be my tastes. Don't get me wrong; he's not a bad director but I wouldn't go handing out awards to him either.On the other hand, the writing here is definitely better than most films of this kind. However, I can't help but wonder if it's a bit too dramatic for action fans and at the same time too violent for drama fans. It can't be denied, though, that the storyline does provide plenty of food for thought.It's good to see that this genre-straddling approach hasn't had the effect of marginalizing the film because it really is worth seeing, both for drama and action fans.",A History of Violence
98,dunmore_ego,When the Evil Twin Piques,6,6 November 2005,"Wearing his Darwinism on his sleeve, director David Cronenberg assails his audience with a movie which is surface ""pulp thriller"", played hard against a psychological cyclorama; a simplistic tale which careens against the cerebral precepts of Survival of the Fittest, Natural Selection and Freudian sublimation. (Any more big words, or are we done for the day?...)Loosely screen-storied by Josh Olson, from the graphic novel of the same name (by John Wagner and Vince Locke), ""A History Of Violence"" centers around leisurely Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen), living the Life Idyllic in a town which elevates podunk to an art form. Running the town diner with the urgency of a napping camel, Tom is well-liked by his bumpkin employees and patrons, and long-married to wife Edie (steaming Maria Bello, so readily-sexed that every man in the audience immediately pegged her as a work of fiction - but we can dream, can't we?).During expository scenes establishing Tom's still-lusty relationship with his spouse of 17 years, and his teen son's status as the school's bully-fodder (both sub-plots artfully invoking the word ""pussy""), Cronenberg tweaks the Norman Rockwell 'til the syrup almost bleeds from the celluloid, setting up his audience in eerily-expectant treacle, to ensure that the subsequent dose of savagery will scythe like razor-wireInto Tom's diner walks the criminal element from the disturbing opening sequence of the film - in a parallel universe, these two guys would be Lance Henriksen and Matthew McConaughey - who attempt to divest Tom of his languidly-earned cash at gunpoint. Big mistake! With the suaveness of a panther, Tom efficiently dispatches the two felons, illustrating he is somewhat less somnolent than his aw-shucks drawl implies. Like George Lucas ignoring his actors for fear of clutter on his green-screen, at this point in the film, Cronenberg opts to ignore intrinsic realities which would clutter his movie's thematic sweeps, to wit, The Media and The Law. The Media, which is instrumental in alerting Tom's presence to characters from his unsavory past, suddenly vanishes altogether once it serves its purpose of conjuring those characters into the storyline; indeed, the absence of an intrusive, ubiquitous press  which, in our reality, would descend rapaciously on a multiple murder story before the last body's chalk outline is drawn  leaves us stranded in an insular universe of the film-maker's creation, and we shift uneasily in our seats for the lack of plausibility this absence fosters.Like an Armani-suited vulture, out of Tom's past comes the sinister Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris), all one-eyed and unnerving, and calling Tom ""Joey from Philly"" with the insistence of a jabbing finger to the chest, presaging Tom's descent into his dark half.Though the trailers tout this ""mystery"" aspect, we are ahead of the characters in identifying that Tom is indeed a re-wrought persona of professional killer ""Joey"", and the movie is more a study in Tom reconciling his adopted pacifism with his innate violent streak. Guess it's like riding a bike; after sublimating it for almost two decades, it is his dormant Art of Killing which saves Tom's life.After loosing his inner beast so publicly, Tom finds that his whipping-boy son has opened a can of whoop-ass on his bullies. Whether he does this due to his father's latent ""violent genes"" or because his father set a decisive example, we are not to know (Nature vs. Nurture?), as a father-son confrontation leads only to a smack upside the head from Tom. When the son goes Outlaw Josey Wales in a later scene, the question looms larger, but it is not Cronenberg's purview to *answer* his thematic questions, only to pose them. Matter of fact, he avoids wrestling his themes to the ground like the Stall family avoids open discussion on Tom's sordid past, leaving us, once again, shifting uneasily.In his outré universe (""Naked Lunch"", ""Crash"", ""eXistenZ""), Cronenberg is king  some may contend dauphin, to David Lynch  of suspenseful, disturbing vignettes, left-field sex, and unapologetic brutality that allows him loving close-ups of decimated faces and mutilated nose cavities; of these aspects, there are plenty in *A History of Violence*, as well as Tom's underlying themes of alienation and betrayal (with his wife), hero-worship and anger (from his son) and self-doubt and intrinsic dependence (on his bad self  not ""Shaft"" bad, but *actually* bad). Yet we cannot reconcile or forgive the haphazard conclusion tacked onto this otherwise engaging drama, starting its fall from grace at the point where the seemingly one-man Sheriff's Department, Sam (Peter MacNeill, recently Detective Horvath of Showtime's ""Queer As Folk""), exhibits embarrassment in questioning Tom - who was only at the quintuple-murder stage at that point! - which serves to highlight the absence of high-level judicial inquiries regarding Tom's hurricane of violence; the Cronenberg ""Ignoring Quotient"" in overdrive. By the time Tom faces his brother, Richie Cusack (a dangerously-smarmy William Hurt, doing his best Gary Oldman), the film degenerates into an Adam West ""Batman"" episode, in which the Villain, who has every opportunity to eradicate the Hero expeditiously, instead plots a prolonged and gruesome death for him, with a lot of Villain-talk - if only the darned Hero would cooperate and stop that infernal escaping! The last scenes seem to be a visceral payoff for the bloodthirsty contingent, and leave us with unanswered  and maybe unanswerable  questions regarding the future of Tom's estranged family dynamic.A history of violence? Isn't this Viggo fella the same guy who spent the last four years raging postal at Helm's Deep and Pelennor Fields, slaughtering thousands of face-challenged evil-kins alongside a dandy archer and fey wizard?

99,leftbanker-1,Violence Does not Equal Entertainment,1,20 September 2014,"There are so many things wrong with this movie, so I'll start at the very beginning. It's from a graphic novel so you shouldn't expect anything remotely interesting or original. Graphic novels aren't really made for adults, and this movie, based on a graphic novel, isn't either.What a completely stupid story on so many levels. I'll give it one thing: the title isn't a tease; there's a butt-load of violence in this thing. Unfortunately, violence doesn't always equal action and rarely does it qualify as entertainment.His son is bullied because he caught a pop fly in a gym class softball game? Even for s sociopathic bully that's a bit of a stretch. Is that all the motivation the writers could think up? . There is nothing remotely original about this and comes from the pile marked ""If you've seen one bully, you've seen them all.""And I really despise movies that have 20 minutes of exposition to show what a decent, kind, and wonderful family guy the hero is in the movie. ""See you in church."" Why don't they show him doing volunteer work with retarded kids? Just get to the juicy bits and we'll just take it for granted that the guy sort of liked his family. They do this in so many films of this ilk and it's always a waste of celluloid.Enter Ed Harris and foreboding. He may as well drive around in one of those sound trucks with big speakers as he announces his presence. So the mob guys show up and he is going to play dumb? That's a hell of strategy and ranks right up there with hiding under the bed. I'm sure the writers tossed around the possibility of him hiding under the bed. Seriously, dude. The moment they showed up, the gig is up and he either needs to get out of Dodge or kill the three of them ASAP.He calls his wife and tells her to get the shotgun because the bad men are coming. He runs home on a foot when only a couple days earlier had a knife stuck in him. He gets home and startles his wife while his son is calmly sitting at the table eating his Captain Crunch? Like his wife didn't bother to tell her own son that they are in enough danger as to warrant the use of a double-barreled 12 gauge?And finally the whole mess of a movie devolves into a Chinese Downhill (See the movie Hotdog) of stupid violence and mayhem with little in the way of story. Who needs story when it comes from a comic book?",A History of Violence
100,KUAlum26,"New Cronenberg,fully realized?",8,22 February 2008,"The David Cronenberg of old would've been much more fascinated with horror of a much more graphic and incredible. One only need to look so far as to classic film efforts such as ""Rabid"",""Scanners"" or ""The Fly"" for examples there. But the newer Cronenberg seems to take more interest in horror that is far more visceral,less(ostensibly)bloody and,in all likelihood,with much longer damages. Past efforts like ""Crash"" and ""Spider"" give that impression.So here's this film. In it,Tom Stall(Viggo Mortensen,eliciting maybe a few 'What happened to Aragorn?'s from viewers enthralled by his LOTR career turn)is an easygoing restaurateur who yields unsolicited attention when he foils an attack by a couple of vile,murderous thugs,putting them down in a particularly violent way. Besides the normal hero worship this draws,this also draws the attention of a scary hit-man named Fogarty(Ed Harris,good in anything it seems)and a particularly ominous mobster named Cusack(William Hurt),and it puts into grave doubt not only the safety of his family(including sexy,girl-next-door wife Maria Bello)but also doubts as to the kind of man Tom is overall.Chilling music from Howard Shore and plenty of darkness,mostly in the form of clouds and shadow,make ""DAve Depraved""'s examination of violence,revenge and security something that has the heart of a horror film,but the sensibility of a noir classic. Never sure whether to be a visceral film or a violent,satisfying actioner,this film is still enthralling enough to merit interest.",A History of Violence
101,pyrocitor,The dark side of man,8,5 November 2005,"Is anyone ever truly innocent? This seems to be the question raised in David Cronenberg's latest thriller, A History of Violence. Based on the graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke, Cronenberg takes a unique and compelling story, and gives it his own unique touch, to great effect. Tom Stall (Viggo Mortenson) is an average, family man complete with loving wife (Maria Bello) and sweet and obedient children. However, one night when Tom's diner is robbed and his customers are threatened, Tom leaps into action, killing both men with a sickening ease. Fortunately, this act of violence is passed off as self defense, and Tom is instead glorified to a ridiculous extent, being branded with the title of 'American Hero'. But when the publicity dies down to an extent, Tom receives visitors of a different sort - a mob boss (Ed Harris) who insists that he knows Tom from back in Philadelphia. When the mob starts to close in on Tom's family, another shocking act of self defense is committed. But Cronenberg doesn't seem satisfied with making a powerful and affecting movie - he also seems determined to make a social comment about today's society, and our exposure to violence, sex and such. Indeed, the actual violence in the story, however fleeting is disturbingly graphic and realistic, and the sex scenes leave virtually nothing to the imagination. Strangely enough though, neither takes away from the excellent story, but only serve to add to the plot. It certainly helps fuel our revoltion of the violent retribution against the Philadelphia mob that the violence is so stark and raw - this way, the story does not in any way, condone the violent acts, but instead sickens us at how unnecessary they were.But the movie is definitely not without its flaws. The script can be rather weak at parts, and certainly makes no effort to stay away from painfully stereotypical characters, including the bully with ego problems, the girlfriend who stands up for Jack despite his pacifist nature (she is quickly dropped out of the story, showing how unnecessary her addition really was) the friendly redneck sheriff and the far overused mobster stereotype, with the exception of William Hurt's character, Joey Cusack, who manages to overcome the gangster stereotype. There is also the occasional plot hole, and gap in logic. None of these would normally come off as very noticeable problems, but in a movie where there are so many excellent aspects, they come off as glaring flaws. However, A History of Violence is ultimately a character driven story, and Cronenberg has succeeded in some impressive casting to drive the story along. Viggo Mortonson is easily the best thing in the film - his conflicted character easily serves to both win our sympathies, and succeed in making us turn away in disgust. Mortenson's powerful and genuine performance brings the troubled 'Tom Stall' to life in a truly believable fashion - it should be no surprise if he receives Oscar recognition next year. Maria Bello is also terrific as Stall's wife Edie, bringing genuine emotional hurt to the part. Ed Harris is suitably menacing as mobster Carl Fogarty, an effect greatly helped by his gruesome makeup, but in the end he still fails to escape the shadow of the stereotypical gangster. However, this is an aspect in which fellow mobster William Hurt succeeds, delivering a highly amusing and surprisingly comical performance. He doesn't seem to entirely fit in with the dark overtones of the movie, but so enjoyable is his performance that we don't mind in the least. However, newcomer Ashton Holmes as Tom's son Jack is a different story. Holmes shows promise for being an excellent actor, especially for one so young, but in many scenes in the film, he comes off as too emotional to really be believable. This on-and-off overacting is a shame, as he does give an impressive performance overall, and is essential to the story - including arguably the movie's most potent scene, where a distressed Tom argues with Jack over his fighting at school. Tom's argument being ""We do not hit people to solve problems in this family!"" Jack's angry reply is ""No, in this family we shoot them!"" after which he is quickly slapped by his father, to his own surprise. A History of Violence is a bittersweet mix of the very good, and some less good. The acting is exceptional and Cronenberg displays a strong and in control directorial sense throughout. But the stereotypical supporting characters and occasional gaps in logic come off as much more of a problem than they should - lending the film an uneven quality between the excellent and the unsatisfactory. But overall, A History of Violence is still an excellent and very strongly made film, enough so for us to forgive its few, but rather prominent weak points. Cronenberg has delivered one of the most powerful and thought provoking movies of the year, and it should be recognized as such. -9/10",A History of Violence

Maria Bello's performance is effective, convincing, memorable, more than Viggo Mortensen's one (that is solid anyway). It deals with the subject of violence explored in every single facet; tells about the way life may change completely when threatened by violence and the way violence passes from generation to generation. David Cronenmberd shows no heroes and no lessons in his work but just a disturbing view of an ordinary and peaceful family living in a sleepy American town, that comes across an unexpected tragedy.

It's simply a great work of cinema and the performances are all believable and intriguing. It moves at a slow but satisfying pace (let's just say it takes its time, wisely so). And the well-timed outbursts of violence are truly violent and disturbing with excellent, gross and bloody make-up effects. Cronenberg continues to grow as a film-maker, even at the ripe age of 62. The opening-shot is an amazingly stylish, slow-moving (almost tender) tracking-shot filmed outdoors at a motel. It then smoothly cuts to a superbly lit studio set, representing the check-out counter. The cut is unnoticeable, because you have the impression the (perfectly matched) sunlight is shining through the door and windows. Then the violence kicks in... Those where only some of the technical aspects I mentioned from the first scene of the movie. You should see all the actors doing there thing. It might not always be perfect (example: the house of Richie Cusack really looked too much like a set), but no movie is.

The acting is very good, especially by Mortensen and Harris. However, the key component, the script, falters at multiple key areas of the story. Partciularly when the mob comes and starts questioning Tom's identity is where the movie starts to go down. The dialogue is ridiculous in many scenes, and the stair sex scene is completely unnecessary, no matter what psychological aspects can be found in it. However, the biggest bone I have with this movie is how little the suspense keeps you in Tom Stall's identity. In just one scene that is about half way through the movie, you find out what the end result is. All this adds up to a simple, formula-made movie that really gives nothing to the audience.

109,baumer,One of the best of the year,9,4 October 2005,"Violence is a part of us. Our entire civilization is built around it. Darwin knew it and then wrote about it and now we study his ""isms"". Survival of the fittest is the paradigm to which Darwin preaches. Back in the prehistoric days, humans hunted for food just like the animals of the wild do now. There was no industrialization, no retail boom and no McDonald's at every corner. Men hunted or they didn't eat. This survival was inherent in them and that has been passed down and now filtered throughout us as we can now kill without passion or prejudice by pressing a button. But once, long ago, that instinct existed in all of us. It might have been bottled up and stored away in many of us, but make no mistake about it, all of us, if the situation called for, might have the wherewithal to kill. We are all animals and all have that basic survival instinct.David Cronenberg's A History of Violence is a multi layered, thought provoking film that explores many issues and then dissects them. This is perhaps one of the most fascinating films to be released since American Beauty. While about as diametric from American Beauty as one might think, it does explore some vaguely similar themes.Viggo Mortensen and Maria Bello are a typical small town American family in rural Indiana. They have two kids, one a teenager and one a precocious little angel of a girl. Tom owns the local diner that bears his family name, STALL. This is the kind of town where everyone knows each other and many visit the diner for a cup of coffee and a piece of pie. Edie Stall is a small town lawyer and together they seem like a happy average American family. Cronenberg paints a scintillating picture of the Stall's as they rekindle their relationship at the beginning of the film with some very suggestive and tangible sex scenes. This is tantamount to the film as it gives you the impression that this married couple have known each other intimately for years.Everything seems to be going quite normally until one night just as Tom is closing up, two thugs come in and threaten the customers with rape and certain death. In an instant, Tom becomes the hero he never wanted to by killing the assailants. This seemed to come naturally to Tom and he saves everyone's life. This brings unwanted attention to him and his family as his past finally catches up to him.Ed Harris is the big time mafia heavy who is sure that Tom Stall is really Joey Cusack from Philadelphia. Tom swears that he is not and he goes to great lengths to convince his family that he is just Tom Stall. Complicating matters is Tom's son is being picked on by the school bully and has avoided any violence by diffusing the situation with a quick tongue. But after witnessing his father's heroics, he lashes out at the school bully and almost kills him. The scene is so raw and pernicious in tone that it feels like you are watching a school yard fight. Cronenberg might not have exploding heads and ripped out intestines in the film, but the violence here is much more palatable and authentic.Cronenberg has often explored themes that deal with violence and how it affects us. Dead Ringers had two very different twins who's lives are surrounded by it and in films like Scanners and Rabid and The Brood, violence is the epicenter of the film. In History of Violence, the violence here is indicative of the life once led. Which begs the question, can you really ever outrun your past? Can you really ever get away from what you once were? I think you can, but Cronenberg isn't so sure. The past always seems to haunt you and this is especially so in this film. I have always admired Cronenberg's work, from his early vomit induced efforts to his more mature and layered films like The Fly and Dead Zone. Cronenberg's vision is often soaked in blood but he always explores the proclivity to commit violence. The act is just the extension of the Darwin like state that exists in all of us. A History of Violence is a film that is about as violent as they come, but the violence is nothing more than the human condition that we are all conditioned with. It's not so much that Cronenberg is a more mature director than he was in the 70's. It's just that he has different things to say. While a film like Scanners might look like it was nothing more than an excuse to watch Michael Ironside's head explode, there were some interesting and judicious decisions in those films that explored the human condition and our propensity towards violence. A History of Violence not only explores that violence, but the human reaction to it. This is a fascinating film in every way. Darwin would be proud.9/10 Maria Bello has to be mentioned here as a side note. Her performance was about as strong a performance I have seen in any actress in quite sometime and I certainly hope she is mentioned come Oscar time.",A History of Violence
110,mstomaso,One of Cronenberg's best and most accessible films,9,9 April 2006,"Cronenberg's adaptation of a Wagner and Locke graphic novel places a simple American family man, and his all-American family, into a new and disturbing context which has them questioning everything they think they know. Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) owns a little diner in a small town and has a nice house on the outskirts of town, where he and his wife Edie (Maria Bello) raise their two kids apparently living the American dream in their own way. One day at the diner, two murderers pop by at closing time for some cherry pie, and Tom's heroic defense of his diner, his customers and himself sets off a series of events that threaten his family, his sanity and his life. The eerie tension never lets up in this powerful examination of identity, honesty and violence.David Cronenberg has directed some of my favorite off-beat films - the masterpiece Naked Lunch, Scanners, Videodrome. I have watched these films many times and I still find them interesting. I can't really call myself a fan, however, because there are also just as many Cronenberg films out there which I found difficult to get through the first time (Crash, eXistenZ, Dead Ringers). Cronenberg enjoys creating disturbing situations and imagery, and wants to get under your skin and to stimulate your mind on as many levels as he can. In most cases, he pulls it off masterfully, but sometimes, his emphasis on the bizarre can come across as pretentious and forced.Like a lot of very creative and intelligent people, Cronenberg sometimes leaves his signature virtually everywhere in his work. And sometimes, a director needs to make a film which does everything they want to accomplish but leaves off the signature. For example - the brilliant David Lynch showed us his ability to jump out of his own skin with Elephant Man and The Straight Story. These are still very much Lynch films, but they also appeal to the wider audience of mainstream cinema-goers. A History of Violence is, in some ways, Cronenberg's most straightforward film. A key to its success is that it is very easy to forget that you are watching a Cronenberg film, no matter how aware you are of Cronenberg's many quirks, idiosyncrasies and trademarks. It is so masterfully directed that, although the plot is not entirely unpredictable, you are right there in the action with the characters and feeling what they feel so that, though you may know what's next, you never exactly see it coming and you never know how it will take you there.Viggo Mortensen, in his best mainstream role since Aragorn, and Maria Bello (one of the actors who made The Cooler worth watching), head an impressive cast in this adaptation of a Wagner and Locke graphic novel. Nobody in the cast slips up at all. The script is intense, realistic, and probably did nothing to make the performances easy. The plot, if described without the plot and the context created by the script, would seem somewhat absurd, but like Woody Allen's Match Point, it's absurdity does not make it impossible to believe. Editing, directing and pure performance combine to make flawless performances for this cast. Backed up by veterans Ed Harris and William Hurt, and very strongly supported by the excellent Maria Bello, Mortensen is shockingly excellent in a difficult role. I can't explain why without giving too much of the film away. Although the rest of the cast did exactly as they were supposed to, I want to single out Ashton Holmes - an actor I was completely unfamiliar with but who I will look out for in the future.I recommend A History of Violence highly. It is one of my top five reasons for considering 2005 to have been a great year in North American film.",A History of Violence
111,sarastro7,Interesting but a bit confusing,7,26 December 2005,"A History of Violence is not a movie for everybody. I gave it a chance, and I thought it was well-produced overall - an art movie, but not a great one.What we do have is a movie that says that it's possible to change. Tom Stall used to be a crazy murderer, until he decided to end that persona and create a decent life for himself, with a loving family. He succeeds. It's not his fault that his past comes knocking on his door, forcing him to become homicidal once again. The real question at the end is, did this violent disruption of familial bliss ruin everything, or can the harmony of the family be restored? The end does seem to say that nothing can ever be quite the same again, yet the family does seem to accept him back into their midst. There is restoration, but it may be on different terms. Just what those new terms will be is not explored, nor, as far as I can see, even hinted at. Not that they necessarily need to be - that's for the audience to figure out.I only have one major problem with the movie, and that's the rough sex scene on the stairs. To connect sex and violence is of course highly characteristic for this director, but it's never been something that made the least bit sense to me. In this scene, when Edie's disgust with Tom is at its highest, and he's being violent to her which he never has before, they're suddenly turned on and into rough stuff? That's not something I can understand at all. It must be the director having some really twisted opinions about how people feel about violence, and I guess it's possible that parts of the audience ""get it"", but I sure as hell don't.Anyway. What I enjoyed most in the movie was Maria Bello, who is one of my absolute favorite actresses. She looked amazing, and did some bloody serious acting, and I think this movie has really put her on the map. Viggo was good too.My rating: 7 out of 10.",A History of Violence

Some people rarely experience bad things,, other people experience more than their fair share.Some people, however,, are bad things,, just waiting to happen,, and they can happen anywhere. Even in the middle of nowhere.Tom and Edie Stall live and work in small town America. They both work hard to provide for their son & daughter, and are for the most part are looked upon as pillars of their community. One evening, as Tom and his two employees are closing up at his diner, two men walk in and sit down for service. Tom politely informs the men that it's closing time, but the men forcefully insist on service, and proceed to threaten everyone with their firearms. In an act of heroism, Tom quickly stops the two men before they can harm anyone, killing them both in the process.In no time the story quickly hits the news stations of how this small town hero stopped these career criminals from harming innocent people.Before too long,, some ""interesting"" people begin showing up at Tom's diner, inquiring about someone named Joey,,,I remember seeing this in the theaters back when it came out. Went in blind, just knew it starred Mortenson, and was supposed to be a suspense thriller of sorts. Dang, was I in for it!I was, and still am not, familiar with the directors previous work,, but oh my,, is this an incredible piece of cinema!!! Not flashy, no computer generated special effects,, just gritty, real stakes and emotions. Mortenson, Bello, Harris, and Hurt all brought their A game to this one.

113,hall895,"Great story, so-so film",6,21 December 2006,"A History of Violence is one of those ultimately frustrating films which leaves you with the sense that it could have been something really special but never quite managed to pull it off. There's a great story here, one brimming with potential. But the movie never fully lives up to the promise of its story. This is certainly not a bad film by any means but it's not a great one either and you get the feeling it should have been.The story revolves around Tom Stall, as played by Viggo Mortensen. Tom is a small-town Indiana family man. He owns a local diner, has a beautiful wife (played wonderfully by Maria Bello) and a couple of kids. He leads a very ordinary, mundane kind of life. Then one day there is an attempted robbery at the diner and Tom saves the day, becoming a local celebrity and a very reluctant hero. The national media even picks up on the story...and that is where the problems begin. After Tom's face is splashed across national television someone shows up in this small Indiana town looking to settle an old score with one Tom Stall. Only this man does not believe Tom Stall is actually Tom Stall at all. This gangster, Carl Fogarty (played with an appropriate level of creepiness by Ed Harris), is certain that he knew Tom Stall as Joey back in Philadelphia. Seems Joey removed one of Fogarty's eyes and then disappeared. Suffice to say Fogarty is not real happy about it. As sure as Fogarty is of Tom Stall's true identity, Tom is just as insistent he is who he claims to be, a simple, ordinary, small-town Indiana family man. Where does the truth lie? The heart of the film is in finding out.So there's the setup. Quite an intriguing one I must say. Mistaken identity? Hidden identity? Either way, with the presence of an obviously dangerous man like Carl Fogarty looming, there are certain to be some chills and thrills along the way. But the film never really takes off. It kind of limps along, with an occasional spasm of brilliance, but it never really works as well as it should. There are certainly some very good moments, but not enough of them to forgive all the lesser moments. And there are plenty of lesser, some would even say pointless, moments sprinkled throughout. It's a great story and the cast, Harris especially, does a great job with what they are given to work with. But in the end the cast, and ultimately the film, are let down by the material. The story's there, you know there's a great film in that story someplace. But that great film never materializes. It's a good film, but one which leaves you wanting more, with the sense it was one good rewrite away from being truly special.",A History of Violence
114,sharky_55,How do you f*ck that up?,7,29 December 2015,"Reading through the reviews of this film there is a distinct divide. Some say the small town setting of Milbrook is idyllic and well crafted, others say it is clichéd and uninspiring. Some criticise the painfully familiar aspects of the protagonist's family and others say that the whole cast is well rounded and complex in its characterisation. Is William Hurt, as the spurred brother, a frightening and poised villain, or is his acting laughably bad? Or maybe if you don't subscribe to Roland Barthes, these are all intentionally and precisely placed by Cronenberg? The reality is he does hit all the clichés. The idyllic small town has everyone know everyone on a first name basis, and the cops take good care of its citizens. We open with the young daughter having had a nightmare, and Tom is there to comfort her. How many movies have opened with the same sequence, solely to establish the loving and caring family man? There is the teenage son, who is at the time of his life where he isn't quite on the same wavelength as his parents, and has troubles at school. There is the marriage which is still strong, and sexually active. These are all recognisable - and Cronenberg knows, and we all know, that it is soon to be ripped apart. And he begins too, with a prototype pair of villains. One, the blander and younger of the two, inexperienced and less inclined to violence, and the older one, who speaks with a guise of politeness and then explodes into sudden rage before resuming his usual broadcast. They are just crooks, we have seen these two before and will again in some other movie. We expect something to happen as soon as he shouts ""COFFEE"", and it does, but Tom moves with such a ruthless efficiency, and it is tightly shot, and each brutal blow is crucial and necessary. Later again he saves his family from the mobsters, and Cronenberg lingers on the money shots that would be the selling point of many horror films and forces us to look at the gore. His 1986 film, Crash, was about those who would purposefully get into car accidents for the sexual thrill of it, and it was a peculiar addiction to the audience, but isn't all addiction a little disturbing? And here he confronting our addictions too, but for violence. Tom finally becomes an invincible force of nature, who with a little flick can snap a man's neck, and his brother winks at the audience as he is baffled by how a protagonist could escape such an ordeal. Richie, it seems, has not seen many action movies. We see this confrontation on a smaller, less important scale in Jack's storyline. He is being bullied, and seems to have every witty comeback lined up, and seeks to de-construct the bully's motives, oh but not in this movie. Here he has to fight, and as he lashes out violently, it is not with the same brutal efficiency as Tom repeatedly shows, but we sense that something has been inherited unwantedly, something that the meek mid-western restaurant owner and loving father cannot keep in check. It is gratifying to see the beat down for a second; for Jack, and for the audience, and then it fades, because he cannot take it back, and because it has corrupted him. Viggo Mortensen anchors it all. There is a precise subtlety to his performance upon a second watch with the knowledge of his violent past. The fakeness of his entire life is only a tiny bit evident, but it can be unveiled. He reacts to the sudden incident and fame with embarrassment and modesty, as if he had only just gotten lucky enough to escape with his life, as if he hadn't dispatched the robbers with a brutal efficiency. Nothing but Tom who serves the coffee. When the orchestration turns frantic and Mortensen desperately limps home, the tension is remarkable, but the second time round, there is an added element of panic; his carefully constructed and maintained life is about to be blown right open. When his wife confronts him sexually, there is just a slight lack of spontaneity - it is later, after his true self is out into the open, that he can truly be physically intimate with her with no repercussions, in the most raw and passionate way. His best moment lies in the hug that he gives his son after the three mobsters lie dead in their front yard; beneath that tender embrace, something has sparked into his eyes, something that cannot be once again hidden away, and his facade is cracking. Or perhaps you might not be so at ease with this analysis. Maybe the pitch perfect clichés of suburban Americana, the baseball games, the corn fields, the close-knit townfolk, the coffee that everybody stops by for each morning...maybe they are too idyllic, too familiar, too bland. Maybe Hurt's spitting resentment is painfully awkward and stilted, or maybe Harris' gangster villain, who accompanies threats with teasing and laughter, is a character you have seen many times before. This world, and the ugly truth that Tom faces at the end, seem to slip in and out of each other with no real bearing. And when it is shattered, the consequences are not, for once, conventional. Tom does not become a lone wanderer, nor does he find a happy family greeting him at the door, but cold harsh silence, and reluctant acceptance. It is powerfully effective, even if the whole innocent daughter sets the table thing is a little cheesy.",A History of Violence
115,MrGKB,"Atypical Cronenberg, but still unsettling",7,23 November 2005,"As brief introduction to my comments on this film, I found two things notable in the breakdown of IMDb voting: one, that females across the board gave the film significantly lower ratings than males, and two, that for such a well put together film, it garnered what I consider an unusually high percentage of ""1"" votes. I can only surmise that those ""1"" votes were predominantly female. Why this is so could be the subject of a lengthy BB discussion, and probably has been. I believe that it has much to do with the resolution of the film and the suggested choice made by the lead female.Based on a ""graphic novel"" that I have never read, Cronenberg's latest foray into the darkness of the human soul and the malleability of personal identity is a powerful and distinctly disturbing character study. Cronenberg has always been fascinated by the yin-yang of sex and death, and love and violence, and ""A History of Violence"" is no exception. No one with any understanding of the conflicting impulses of the human spirit can fail to be affected by this noir-ish drama.The plot is almost cliché: thugs on the loose invade a small town diner owned by a peaceful and unassuming Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen), who successfully dispatches them with seemingly uncharacteristic efficiency. His newsworthy heroism attracts the attention of ""made"" man, Carl Fogarty (played to chilling perfection by the always superb Ed Harris), who arrives in town to deliver Tom up to the rough justice of a previously unsuspected past life. Questions of identity, fidelity, trust and love are explored as Tom deals with the consequences of buried sins reemerging into the tranquil peace of a well-established new start. Can Tom's lawyer wife (played with sensuous and conflicted sensitivity by the talented and beautiful Maria Bello) reconcile her love and devotion to the man she thought her husband was with the revelation of who he really is? Can a son (Ashton Holmes, a soap opera actor who shows great promise) deal with the dichotomy of what his father taught him and the actions his father's true nature bring out in him? Can a daughter too young to really understand deal with the grim truth that the monsters sometimes CAN come out into the light? There are no cut-and-dried answers in the purposefully ambiguous conclusion of ""A History of Violence."" Cronenberg knows very well that there are no genuinely happy endings.The violence in the film is quick, brutal, and never gratuitous. Unlike in many of his past films, the camera never lingers long on the results. Cronenberg forces his audience to consider not the physical effects of violence, though he makes no effort to conceal the awfulness of those effects (with the exception, thank goodness, of the murder of a child early in the first act); rather he wants us to reflect on the moral and psychological ramifications of that violence. There is little of the standard Hollywood glorification and stylization of violence; instead, it is shown in all its evil banality. In that regard, ""A History of Violence"" reminded me a great deal of John McNaughton's ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer."" Gunplay isn't preceded by knowing winks and death doesn't announce itself with smart-ass one-liners. Violence is eye-blinkingly swift and remorseless. It's what comes after that stretches into eternity and finds time for guilt and confusion.The sex in the film is equally candid and essential, subtly linking the violence yet to come (""You're such a bad boy"") and that which transpires during (cf. the iconographic stairway make-up sex) and after. Nor does it hurt that the participants are an attractive couple with more than enough chemistry to render said scenes with undeniable passion and intensity.Uncharacteristically mainstream as it may be, ""A History of Violence"" is still trademark Cronenberg, a mature Cronenberg at the height of his powers. Coupled with the cinematography of longtime collaborator, Peter Sischitzky, the editing skills of even longer-time collaborator, Ronald Sanders, and a fine ensemble cast that also includes noteworthy turns by William Hurt as Tom's gangster brother and character actor, Peter MacNeill, as an unstereotypical sheriff, Cronenberg has fashioned a tight work of psychological drama that most any other director would be proud to claim as a crown jewel. I can only hope that the eventual DVD release has a full menu of extras, although I'll be picking it up (he admits in crass and unabashed non-sequitur) just for the sublime revelation of Maria Bello's delightful charms. Be that personal peccadillo as it may, ""A History of Violence"" is a worthy addition to any thinking cinemaphile's library.",A History of Violence
116,Stampsfightclub,Strong minded and spontaneous crime drama,9,7 January 2009,"After Tom Stall (Mortensen) stops two criminals robbing his restaurant he is recognized as a gangster and his past is soon catching up with him.If we take a trip down memory lane and turn down gangster alley you will see Goodfellas and The Godfather right at the top with sophisticated gritty approaches to the crime world and down in the dumps sits Be Cool and the Punisher with their far-fetched representations.On description this would seem to be with the poor Travolta flicks but with a sharp and intellectual reflection of gangsters it is right up their with the Oscar winners.No clichés, no stereotypes, A History of Violence is a unique surprise. A hard hitting film of quality that is a pleasure to watch over and over. A statement this cheesy shouldn't be allowed for a film so unpredictable but whatever you want to say about this film, it is a fine piece of art that is a definitive approach to the crime universe.Starting with a view of a struggling family the narrative unfolds into a mystery as we try to decode the past of Tom Stall.Mortensen's gentle and silent approach is fantastic and the action guy we see glimpses of is an important and interesting segment of the changing narrative. Not a stereotype or any copycat to another gangster, this is a terrific silent and delicate creation.The slow story works tremendously well with Cronenberg's articulate styled direction. The softly paced story focusing on the family's lives encoded next to a collection of action sequences gives it a dramatic gritty edge. There are few moments which drag but the story balances realism and action in a way to make for riveting viewing.A History of Violence is almost a noir with its gentle depiction of the crime world and Maria Bello's Edie looking the part of a strong minded femme fatale.Fantastic stylist direction combined with great performances and a sharp narrative and you have an unpredictable entertaining and importantly realistic film that should sit up their with the other kings of the genre.",A History of Violence
117,KnightsofNi11,A thrilling film,8,5 July 2011,"Some directors hit their peaks and then it is all downhill from here. David Cronenberg hit his peak with films like The Fly and Scanners back in the 80's but then his success continued into the 2000's when he made the incredible little film A History of Violence. It stars Viggo Mortenson as Tom Stall, a hard working family man who owns a coffee shop and raises two loving kids with his beautiful young wife. But one night he unexpectedly becomes a hero when he murders two men attempting to rob his store. This act of violence has repercussions that slowly tear apart his family and his humble reputation in the town. The film is harsh and brutal but incredibly powerful and intense to watch. I think Cronenberg struck gold here.The film is based on a graphic novel and Cronenberg captures the real world comic book feel excellently. The film has an odd pacing and a peculiar atmosphere to it that really makes it stand out. The film opens by introducing Tom Stall's perfect small town life, a life that almost seems too perfect. This Utopian bubble he lives in hardly feels real or possible. This bothered me at first but the reasoning behind it becomes very clear later into the film when the bubble is popped and the world comes crashing down around Tom. It's a subtle maneuver but highly effective.One thing that made the entire film more enjoyable was Cronenberg's direction. This film almost feels like it should have been made back in the 80's, a time when action directors still knew how to hold the camera still. A History of Violence is filled with long still shots and slow steady pans that capture the films intensity so much better than jumpy cuts and a ridiculously shaky cam could. The direction also puts a lot of focus towards the actors of the film which are all great. Mortenson's acting style seems deadpan at times and it takes a little bit of getting used to but I can't say his performance and character aren't moving. Maria Bello plays Edie Stall, Tom's wife in a very tormented and excellent performance. Ed Harris and William Hurt also deliver incredible performances as disturbing villains that are just over the top enough to believe and still fear.As offbeat as this film can be at times it still is excellent and it all works very well. It is a film that you can be moved and entertained by because of Cronenberg's intense direction and the actors moving performances. The film's unique story is enough to get one hooked on this film, but everything else comes together so nicely that it really makes A History of Violence an excellent film.",A History of Violence
118,jon.h.ochiai,In the Blood,10,2 October 2005,"In the middle of the night young Sarah (Heidi Hayes) wakes from a nightmare. Her father, Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) comforts her saying, ""There are no such thing as monsters"" Director David Cronenberg's ""A History of Violence"" questions whether human monsters are truly born or trained to be so. Based on a graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke, Josh Olson's screenplay offers a provocative answer. Though for Cronenberg and Olson , the power of ""A History of Violence"" lies in its character study. Viggo Mortensen as Tom Stall is commanding and powerful as the center of this character piece. This is one the year's best movies.Cronenberg creates the idyllic setting of a small Indiana town. Tom Stall (Mortensen) is a mild mannered and community respected family man. He has a loving and beautiful wife Edie (strong and smart Maria Bello). His daughter Sarah likes shopping for shoes. His teenage son Jack (Ashton Holmes) is sucking as a baseball player and a target of bully Bobby (Kyle Schmid). Tom owns Stall's Dinner in town. Then one day ruthless killers (evil Stephen McHattie and Greg Bryk) draw their guns in a robbery attempt at Tom's diner. Tom kills both like they are not even there. He dispatches them with awesome deadly force and brutality. His actions are warranted, and seemingly instinctive. Tom becomes a town and national hero. His photo even appears on CNN.Soon after returning to work a mysterious man and his henchmen visit Tom in his diner. The man, Carl Fogerty (menacing Ed Harris), reveals a disfiguring injury and claims to know Tom, as Joey Cusack. Tom really does not seem to know Carl, and kindly asks him to leave. Things don't seem to add up regarding Tom. Carl later asks Tom's wife Edie ""Why is he (Tom) so good at killing people."" Cronenberg brilliantly lulls us in a sense of normalcy, then launches in a predetermined direction and tone. He hints at his answer with son Jack's explosive actions. Also his ""A History of Violence"" is a study of extremes, likely intentional. The violence is graphic controlled brutality, and merciless. The sex scene with Tom and Edie on the stairs is raw and erotic. Cronenberg also manages an unexpected resolution.Viggo Mortensen is electrifying. He uses his classic good looks and understated charm to play the gentle family man Tom Stall. Mortensen also displays a powerful and explosive presence as Tom's darker persona. Mortensen is athletic and expertly performs the amazing martial arts and fight scenes. Maria Bello is awesome as Edie. Even with her glamor subdued she is stunning and sexy. Her Edie is strong willed enduring her own doubts regarding who her husband really is. Her reaction at the story's arc is both believable and heartbreaking. She and Mortensen have amazing chemistry. Ed Harris is calculated evil as Carl Fogerty. Newcomer Ashton Holmes is impressive as young Jack. His portrayal leads us to believe it maybe truly in the blood. William Hurt's turn in a pivotal role is unexpectedly shocking and completely effective.Cronenberg has fashioned a fable about character and fate in ""A History of Violence"". This is one of the best movies of the year. Viggo Mortensen is simply powerful. ""A History of Violence"" is worth seeing and worthy of thought.",A History of Violence
119,TOMASBBloodhound,Lots to hold your interest here.,8,9 November 2010,"What on the surface may sound like an unoriginal, even clichéd story is crafted into an engrossing thriller by veteran director David Cronenberg. A History of Violence more than delivers in the violence department, and like many films from this director, there is even some kinky sex thrown in. The story centers around a seemingly normal small town diner owner (Mortensen) who becomes a national media story after killing two murderous creeps who attempt to hold his place up. Was this just the heroic act of a common man pushed to the limit, or is there more to this man than meets the eye? It soon becomes obvious that it is the latter.For one thing, Mortensen seems to use noticeable skill at defeating these criminals. Almost as if he has done this kind of thing before. And soon as the national media run with the story, things quickly go down the drain for Mortenson and his idyllic small town family. We learn that he was once some sort of young mafia hotshot hit-man from Philly, and there are people from that past life that recognize him and his handiwork instantly. From then on, Mortensen must use his killing skills again and again to fight off a small army of wise guys. Many of the cast members die graphically.Though some of the individual situations end predictably and the film does offer its share of small town clichés, your eyes will still be glued to the screen. The acting is quite good, and some of the casting choices were truly a stroke of genius. Maria Bello, always an under-appreciated talent shines as the good wife of our hero. William Hurt steals his brief screen time and makes you want more of him. He even provides my favorite moment as he berates an underling for botching a great chance to kill Mortensen with piano wire. ""How do you f*ck that up?!"" he screams more than once at the guy. Then he shoots him himself. Hilarious!

There is a lot more going on in this film than I have explained in my review and it is a very well crafted and put together film and it is very interesting and it works as a good character drama and also as a thriller. My only complain I have with the film is that it starts out so strong and the second half I was a little bit disappointed with and it wasn't as strong as a whole as I found the first part to be. It is still good but not as I was gripping or thought provoking as the first half. This is still a good film though from director David Cronenberg (a favourite director of mine) and I still recommend the film quite highly for it's very good first half and all the talent that went into the film in front of and behind it.",A History of Violence
122,krorie,This could have been a great film,8,14 March 2006,"First, what's with the opening? The film doesn't really get started until the diner shootout scene. Although there is some need for background, the way Cronenberg handles the fifteen-minute-plus buildup the viewer would think he is trying to show the world what a great artsy director he is. Why does he want to be a Jean Cocteau or a François Truffaut? Why not be a David Cronenberg and cut the crap.Another problem is the title. ""A History of Violence"" which sounds like a Saturday night special on the History Channel. Someone as experienced as Cronenberg with such winners as ""The Fly"" on his resume should know how important effective titles are for movies. Though the allegorical nature of the title is clear, it is much too bland.A third weakness is somewhat beyond Cronenberg's control. Viggo Mortensen just doesn't cut it as the protagonist. He is unable to scale the acting heights required for his character to develop into a living, breathing person. His mumbling is also distracting. Marlon Brando and James Dean could do it because they knew how to utilize it effectively and when not to utilize it. Mortensen is simply not the method actor he tries to be. He is better suited for supporting type roles, as in ""Witness."" But this movie does have merit. Once it gets started, though it tends to be talky in places, it tells a good story. The media makes a hero out of a small-town dinner operator when he saves the day by blowing away two thugs trying to rob and terrorize the place. A menacing scarred-faced Ed Harris appears on the scene with a couple of henchmen at his side, obviously to do harm to someone. That someone is the diner hero and his family. Seems the diner owner's past catches up with him as a result of the media blitz. There is also an effective subplot involving the diner owner's son played by Ashton Holmes who himself is terrorized by a threatening bully. His father's actions encourage the son to take care of his problem.By the diner owner's side is his stand-by-your-man wife portrayed by Maria Bello who has one of the most sexually arousing scenes in recent movie history. She dresses as a cheerleader to take her husband on a fantasy trip the viewer won't soon forget. Cronenberg makes the most of this prurient encounter.While Viggo Mortensen falls short in the acting department, the rest of the cast comes through, with stand-out performances by Ed Harris and William Hurt. The script is believable, though verbose, with some good lines from time to time.Graphic violence on the screen doesn't bother me because I understand that it's only make believe but I don't appreciate gratuitous violence. There were a few shots in ""A History of Violence"" that I thought were unnecessary. Apparently, Cronenberg thinks he has to live up to his reputation for showing blood and gore in his films regardless of the need.This film is worthwhile. With a little more work, including a shorter running time, it could have been great.",A History of Violence
123,gregsrants,One of the best of the year,8,2 October 2005,"Bacon, lettuce and tomato. Larry, Moe and Curly. Sex, Violence and Cronenberg. Some things are just meant to go together.Now I can forgive the casual film-goer if the name David Cronenberg is not easily recognizable. Born in Toronto, Canada, Cronenberg has put together a resume that makes the most avid of Fangoria magazine stutter with respect but his choice of genre doesn't exactly make himself a name thrown around at the dinner table. With a career that started in the 1960's mostly with television, Cronenberg made his first impression with audiences in 1975 with the horror film Shivers. The film was hardly a masterpiece, but it set Cronenberg's career in flight and he was able to get $500 million for financing for his next feature, Rabid that starred both sexual mega-star Marilyn Chambers and a bunch of blood sucking zombies (there is no real connection between the two, it's just fun to put Chambers and zombies in the same sentence).The years that followed produced forgettable but watchable horror fare with Scanners, The Brood and Videodrome to name a few, but then in 1983, Cronenberg had the opportunity to direct a Stephen King novel (which in 1983 was not as yawned at proposition as it is in the new millennium). The result was The Dead Zone starring Christopher Walken and Martin Sheen and alas, Cronenberg had finally arrived.His follow-ups including The Fly, Dead Ringers and The Naked Lunch were well received and earned him a fan base of anyone who ever understood and appreciated a Hunter S. Thompson novel.Up and down the filmography there is a consistent theme, sex and violence. You have to look no further than Cronenberg's Crash and eXistenZ to see how comfortable the director is at making the audience uncomfortable with his mix of blood and skin.So it should come to no surprise then that Cronenberg was attracted to the graphic novel A History of Violence by John Wagner and Vince Locke. After all the screenplay as adapted by Josh Olson told the story of an ordinary man in a small unknown town that after defending the patrons of the local diner from two murdering thugs, is thrust into the spotlight where his violent past comes back to haunt him.This ordinary man is Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) and after his heroic event appears on television throughout the country, a big time mobster named Carl Fogarty recognizes him and travels to the small town to both confront and take back to Philadelphia the same man that he remembers as Joey Cusack.The appearance of Fogarty and his car full of goons sends the Stall family into a tailspin. At first denying a previous life of crime, Tom soon reveals to his wife (played so incredibly well by Coyote Ugly's Maria Bello), that his past has indeed caught up to him and that the Joey they refer to was exorcised in the desert years ago. But with hardly enough time to adjust to the sickening news that the man whose last name she has accepted was once one of the same people terrorizing the Stall family, the two most find a common ground to at least fight the violence that stalks them.Cronenberg does a fantastic job of telling the story of the Stall family without getting off tracked by subplots, over wrought musical scores or a Hollywood story arc that would have made this film appealing to the Bruce Willis action heroes. Instead, we get a tight, violent when required story that ends up being one of the best films of the year simply because it quietly goes about its business.And that is harder to accomplish than you might think. When Carl reveals to Tom's wife that Joey was responsible to taking barbed wire to his face thus blinding him in one eye, lesser directors would have had a flashback to an empty warehouse so that the violence of that particular atrocity could be played out in bloody detail. And when Joey/Tom does travel back to Philly to confront his older brother Richie, the scene stealing performance by William Hurt might have lead to a few additional shots included that would be unnecessary to the overall climax.Don't get me wrong, A History of Violence does have its blood splattering, gut wrenching gore. People are shot through the head, bones are broken and the body count does get into the double digits. But it all seems to necessary to show how violence is all around us and that it is hard to escape no matter what new leaf you try to turn.Premiering at Cannes and again at the Toronto Film Festival, A History of Violence was very well received by both the foreign and domestic critics. Audiences seemed to appreciate the straight forwardness of the plot and weren't turned off by the sex  and there is enough to earn the movie an R-rating  that is mixed right in amongst the gun shooting. But I do caution those that only go to the theatre once every few months for a night out. A History of Violence might be too much of some things and too little of others for you to fully appreciate the experience without the luxury of pausing the film and digesting the on-screen developments.But whether it is on DVD early next year or with a group of strangers at the local theatre, A History of Violence is one of the best films of the year and should not be missed.www.gregsrants.com",A History of Violence
124,joebloggscity,Simple violent movie that intrigues but is never too heavy handed with the plot...,7,29 December 2005,"When you first hear the title, you get the impression this is going to be a bit of a gung-ho movie in the Van Damme sort of way. Luckily it isn't and with Mortenson as the lead in this film you actually get a good lead in this story of a local hero pursued in his hometown to be someone who he claims he isn't.Direction is simple, whilst the choreography of the violence is short, sharp and effective without necessarily glorifying the genre. None of that though overshadows the story in the movie, with the tension in family the main gist of the movie, as they try to cope with the circumstances in hand.A slick movie though no classic, let down by a few bad scenes at points, but overall an enjoyable movie. Not necessarily one for the girlfriend, but will keep you engrossed for the 90 mins.",A History of Violence
125,cchase,When Perception Is No Longer Reality...,9,1 December 2007,"We fans of Cronenberg have long revered him for the various ways he has portrayed the human body's capacity to betray and ultimately destroy us, (SCANNERS, VIDEODROME, THE BROOD, etc.) Now he does the same thing for the depths of the human heart with A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE.If it sounds to you like he's suddenly gone crazy and started directing romances, guess what? He has...but only in the way that HE would do it. Though the test of a woman's true love for a man is at the core of the story, make no mistake about it...the journey to that core is a perilous, bloody and extremely violent one at that. Viggo Mortensen, once again delivering another jaw-dropping performance, plays Tom Stall, the handsome, engaging and squeaky-clean proprietor of a diner in a small Midwestern town that could almost double for Mayberry. He has a gorgeous wife, Edie (Maria Bello), who loves him more than any man could hope for or possibly deserve, a young daughter, Sarah (Heidi Holmes) and a sensitive, clever son, Jack (Ashton Holmes), who looks to his dad for guidance as he goes through the teenage struggle of trying to figure out who he is.But there's a storm coming to decimate Tom's paradise, in the form of two career criminals who are about as out-of-place in town as possible: Leland (Stephen McHattie) and his protégé, Billy (Greg Bryk), who decide one night to hold up Tom's diner when they need cash...and to satisfy their craving to kill. But the mild-mannered, easy-going Tom surprises even himself, when he takes out the two thugs with the ease of Jason Statham strolling down to the corner for a Sunday paper. Suddenly, Tom is a local hero, and his quiet life is turned upside-down by all the attention. Attention that draws the interest of some people even more vicious and ill-intended than the men that Tom killed...only these guys seem to know him as someone named ""Joey"", and they're led by one of the most menacing villains to come along in a while, Carl Fogarty (a beautiful turn by Ed Harris underneath a half-pound of scar tissue.)As Carl and his henchmen make good on their threats to tear apart the Stall family, the questions begin to divide them even more. Is Tom Stall, devoted family man and well-liked community figure really who he says he is? Or is he ""Joey"", a man who could be more dangerous than any of the men who seem so intent to bring him down? Even Tom himself is not sure at first, and no one is close to being prepared for the stunning truth of it all. For one of his non-sci-fi themed thrillers, Cronenberg has done a magnificent job with Josh Olson's script, based on the best-selling graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke. Much like Brian De Palma as he moved from his horror-movie and thriller phases into his ""gangster"" mode, Cronenberg taps into his aptitude for mining the depths of human nature and making that the backbone of the story, no matter what the genre he's working in is.And everyone brings their 'A-game' to the table here. The chemistry between Mortensen and Bello is about the best you will ever see between two leads, especially when it involves the kind of love scenes that are so real that you find yourself feeling like a 'dirty' voyeur for watching them. Even the cameos and bit parts are well-played. Kudos to Harris for fearlessly playing someone you love to hate once again, and mention must be made, of course, of William Hurt's Oscar-nominated turn as a pivotal character who spins the entire drama into a new direction and its most shocking revelation. Lovers of crime thrillers and DC fans alike need to put A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE on their ""must-see"" lists.",A History of Violence
126,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Cronenberg scores again,8,2 October 2005,"Much like his previous film ""Spider,"" David Cronenberg gives us a thriller with a haunting memory that comes out at the main character.Tom Stall is a loving husband, caring father, and the owner of a diner in a small American town. His son has a some problems in school, his young daughter is afraid of monsters in her closet, and he has a beautiful wife: in short he has a typical, but nonetheless good life. Good until two hoodlums hold up his diner one night and, to everyone's surprise, Tom, single-handedly takes them out and is hailed a local hero. The story catches onto the national news quickly and soon everyone wants to talk to Tom Stall. Being modest about what he did he doesn't really go nuts over the attention he is getting, but his actions have caught the attention of some mysterious people, presumably the mob. These people who say they know him, but how can a peaceful man like Tom Stall have anything to do with the criminal underworld?Cronenberg's direction is assured and, like in most of his movies, he makes good use of symbols and metaphors that, to a great effect, bind the story together under the surface and make for a tight and interesting movie. In the end, the film is a compelling look at how a typical family can be shaken up by violence and how an ugly secret of the past, whether your own or of someone you know, can catch up to you. 8/10Rated R: graphic violence, profanity, and sex",A History of Violence
127,abisio,The other best movie of the year,9,26 September 2005,"Up to last month, I thought that Crash was by far, the best movie of 2005. After seeing A History of Violence in the Toronto Film Festival, I believe the race became tougher.Viggo Mortensen is Tom, a quiet (an almost shy) family man in Any Town USA (or the world) with two kids one of them in High School hell. Tom owns a small dinner in town while his wife Eddie is the town lawyer. They are a somehow normal family with some sex dates (between husband and wife) probably to break the monotony. One day, unexpected two vicious robbers arrive to the city and try violently to steal from the dinner. Tom, as natural as serving coffee, kill both men and become to his disgust the local hero and suddenly his picture is everywhere in the country.In less time than you can say, ""shoot"" a group of organized crime criminals arrive to the city, accosting the family, claiming that Tom is not who everybody thinks, but a very vicious Chicago killer. A there the movie becomes a masterpiece.The director, David Cronenberg is not interested in the action part of the history (which by the way is handed with shocking violence), but on the relations and the cascade effect of the revelation on the family and the environment. Tom's son Jack (an excellent Ashton Holmes); a normal (obviously repressed) student, release his inner angry in a quite violent way almost killing a bully at school and later will confront his father. Eddie become upset and rejects his husband and everything becomes hell; however, Tom negates everything.Cronenberg has made an analogy between violence and drugs or any other vice around. Once you are involved, getting out is not that easy; but WHY? Do people have the right to forgiveness? That is the question the movie asks but never answers. Our world has become such a violent place.Hate is everywhere and human life has not any value. When we think about thousand of people are dieing everyday in Iraq for a nonsense war (with the Catholic Church not even praying to stop it) and even in USA for ""economic reasons"" like no budget for New Orleans; what the movie proposes becomes very realistic. You are not safe, even within your family.The comparisons with CRASH are obvious. Both deal with violence in our society.

128,EijnarAmadeus,The Shape of Things to Come,9,30 November 2009,"David Cronenberg's A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE is a film with several fascinating layers as the title itself suggests a USA with violence drenched in its DNA, and odd, but cleverly interesting, elements of Darwinism, and the possibly schizophrenic, multi-layered human being. He's dealt with psychologically (and physically) scattered characters before, but he's never done it so exceptionally as here. Viggo Mortensen stars as Tom Stall, a small-town folks-man who gets into trouble when he kills two brutes in his diner and gets his face on the local news. Soon, more trouble's to come, in the presence of a sinister Ed Harris and his two colleagues, who claims Tom's real name is Joey, and his real job's not dining customers, but killing for money. This makes for repercussions that starts shackling Tom's family and life.The first scene Cronenberg presents us is one of the most cold-blooded killings of latter cinema, what shows no sign of supposed humanity is the early beatings of what's to come. Moving on, the film effortlessly, but quickly zooms in on the Stall family, with a romantic marriage at center, and their 15-year old boy getting battered at school and their six-year old daughter having nightmares about monsters, as undercurrents. In what may be the most thrilling single-scene Cronenberg's ever shot, Tom literally leaps from quietly mannered, mild-talking husband/father to a gunslinging force of nature - and as the film slowly starts peeling its own (and your) skin off, Cronenberg and his story gets to you in ways you'd never predict.Viggo Mortensen is absolutely astonishing in the central performance, so is also Maria Bello as his confused wife, Ashton Holmes as his son, and not to mention the bad-guys of Ed Harris, and the brief, but fantastic, appearance by William Hurt. All characters have hints of things to come, and although the film's brutal violence, thrilling plot and interesting themes may be enough for many of the audience to find the film satisfactory, there's reason to dig deeper - it's incredible how Cronenberg manages to place an intelligent irony right before our face.

129,RanchoTuVu,Sounds good on paper,6,8 January 2006,"Viggo Mortneson plays an ex Philadelphia mobster who has long since changed his identity and relocated to a rural Indiana town, gotten married to Maria Bello, had two children (one now a teenager), and opened a diner. His past comes roaring back when, one night two ruthless killers enter the restaurant at closing time. When he kills them in self defense his name is plastered all over the media as a hero. Through the unwanted publicity, his Philadelphia connections (Ed Harris and crew) come looking for him. Confronted with his past, he's forced into more brutal violence, to the extent that his wife (Bello) and son realize that this isn't the man they thought. Sounds good on paper, but the execution of this film veers farther away from reality with each scene. Nonetheless, when he drives back to Philadelphia and hooks up with his crime boss brother (William Hurt) things start to look promising, though only momentarily. Borrowing from a few film noir classics, The Killers (1947) and Act of Violence, the film has a good plot, but unlike Siodmak and Zinneman, Cronenberg makes a good story into a pretty mundane movie.",A History of Violence

I'm a great admirer of Vigo Mortensen but I must confess the title of this fine film turned me off seeing it originally. I really only started catching up on Vigo's body of film work since his Academy Award nominated role of Tony Lipp the Italian machismo chauffeur in the wonderful 2018 film ""Green Book"" . I really enjoyed ""A History of Violence "" immensely mainly for the interesting precept of the personality change of the main character Tom Stall from gentle family man and provider to the complete opposite side of the coin , hence the title ""A History of Violence "" can a person really put their past totally behind them? or is it just waiting to resurface?Tom Stall, is a humble family man and owner of a popular neighborhood restaurant, living a quiet but fulfilling existence in the Midwest. One night Tom foils a crime at his place of business and, to his chagrin, is plastered all over the news for his heroics. Following this, mysterious people follow the Stalls' every move, concerning Tom more than anyone else. As this situation is confronted, more lurks out over where all these occurrences have stemmed from compromising his marriage, family relationship and the main characters' former relations in the process.
The mysterious people include Ed Harris excellent portrayal of Carl Fogarty a gangster hit man convinced Tom Stall is the man who gouged his eye out and wanting payback . In a brief but superb role that was filmed in 5 days William Hurt plays Richie Cusack a menacing Crime boss also with a score to settle with Tom.Yes the film Is violent briefly in parts ,it's necessary and these days is probably tame compared to what we're subjected to on our screens today.
It's a great ensemble cast special mention to Maria Bello aa Edie Stall ,Tom's disillusioned wife and Ashton Holmes as his son Jack they make this family believable.
In fact I couldn't help thinking that with so many firearms and weapons in American homes so they can ""protect their constitutional freedom"" that this scenario of violence is played out today ,perhaps with different circumstances but still really only protecting their ""History of Violence .""",A History of Violence
131,Superunknovvn,What happened to David Cronenberg?,5,18 October 2005,"Damn, David Cronenberg's style has changed over the past 15 years. I still remember him as the guy who picked the weirdest stories and turned them into intriguing movies. Then all of a sudden he turned to more drama orientated material and slowed the pacing of his movies down so much that it's almost painful. ""Spider"" is the perfect example. Beautiful cinematography and a great cast, but the whole thing was directed so tardily that it was hard to make it through the movie without falling asleep. ""A History Of Violence"" continues this tradition. From the first few minutes on, you realize that Cronenberg takes an incredibly long time to develop his story. Okay, you think and lean back. A slow built-up isn't necessarily bad. Maybe this will make the second half of the movie all the more gripping. It doesn't. ""A History Of Violence"" never gets gripping, no matter how many people are getting shot and slaughtered brutally.The main problem, besides the tired direction, is that the script sucks. It's unbelievable, it doesn't go anywhere. I find it hard to believe that so many IMDb-users thought Cronenberg struck a nerve with this movie, because it left me totally cold. Does the movie have a message? No. Is it entertaining? No. Is it touching? No. So what the hell is the intention of it? Cronenberg definitely has managed the transition from 80's cult movies to recent big budget flicks more gracefully than John Carpenter or Wes Craven (although Craven's ""Red Eye"" was a lot more entertaining and thrilling than ""Violence""). Still, his self-indulgent storytelling isn't always helping his movies. With the right script in his hands, Cronenberg can be great. However, his style doesn't work for every kind of story and his choices were particularly unfortunate when it came to this project.",A History of Violence

133,Isaac5855,A Rich and Multi-Layered Examination of the Concept of Violence in America....,8,22 June 2007,"A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE is a disturbing and completely riveting drama that shines a light on several aspects of the concept of violence and its varying effects on the lives it invades. What appears to be a simple story slowly unfolds to reveal several different layers of a richly textured look at violence on several levels. The film stars Viggo Mortensen as Tom Stall, a small town everyman who owns a diner, is married to an attractive lawyer (Maria Bello)and is the father of two children whose life is changed forever when during what appears to be a random act of violence at his diner one night, Tom kills two people in self-defense and in defense of his business and patrons. The publicity that surrounds this event shines an unflattering light around Tom which he is clearly uncomfortable with but we're not sure why until a stranger pulls into town claiming that Tom is not who he says he is. Tom denies the allegation but it eventually becomes clear that Tom is actually a former mafioso named Joey Cusack, who has been tracked down by his brother, with whom he has unfinished business. The slow reveal of this story is quite unsettling because as we watch, we begin to figure out what is going on, but we hope we're wrong. The film not only looks at mob violence, but it also looks at violence as an instrument of self defense; it looks at the possible connection between violence and genetics as Tom's son is observed dealing with a school bully in a rather unsettling way, and it even examines violence between a husband and wife as Tom's world begins to unravel and he attempts to take control of his life again by taking control of his marriage. Mortenson turns in a complex and evocative performance as Tom/Joey, a quiet man driven to extremes as the new life he has constructed for himself begins to fall apart. Maria Bello gives the performance of her career as Tom's wife Edie, who has had the emotional breath knocked out of her marriage and is at a loss as to how to deal with the fact that her entire existence has been a lie. Ed Harris does a bone-chilling turn as the mobster who tracks Tom/Joey down and, as we learned, was disfigured because of him and William Hurt received an Oscar nomination for his flashy turn as Joey's brother, a performance that gets more interesting with multiple viewings. A haunting and powerful film experience that will get inside you and eat away at your soul and provide just as many questions as it does answers.",A History of Violence

136,DonFishies,"A strong film with strong performances, but missing what could have made it stronger",8,8 June 2006,"When I think of David Cronenberg, I think of bizarre, offbeat films. For me, my first (and probably only) full viewing of Videodrome, left me in the most illogical and stupefied mindset I have ever been in. And even though I comprehend that film a lot more than I did that night, for me, it still resonates as the one movie that truly manipulated the way I view films. I continued watching his films, for kicks since I knew I would probably not like them entirely as much as I should (like The Fly and Naked Lunch), but when I saw the trailers for A History of Violence, I felt an automatic need to see it.The ""mainstream"" Cronenberg film is about Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen). He runs a diner in a small town in Indiana, and lives with his wife Edie (Maria Bello) and his son Jack (Ashton Holmes) and Sarah (Heidi Hayes). He lives his life as simplistically as possible, and is a noble, friendly man. But one night, two men come in to rob the diner, and as one of them goes to attack one of the waitresses, Tom unleashes a feat of incredible violence that leaves the two men dead, and him an injured town hero. The media covers the popular story, and it changes everyone in the Stall household. Days later, Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris) wanders into town, calling Tom ""Joey"", and asking him to come back to Philadelphia to make peace with his mobster brother Richie (William Hurt). Of course, Tom denies this, but it only helps to make the changing family change even more so.While the film may not be nearly as strange as a Cronenberg film usually is, it is still well done, and brilliantly put forth to screen. While the film is based on a graphic novel, it is virtually different in almost every way (minus the key points of killing the two men and being harassed by Fogarty). The problem with the graphic novel was that it was specifically about Tom's past, and was completely ludicrous in what occurs over the course of it. Cronenberg left this idea on the floor, and amps up John Olson's script about the destruction of the family unit (while adding in his trademark violence and sexual elements). This act of violence that Tom commits has a tremendous impact on the family in both mediums, but only in the film is it apparent just how tremendous it is. What is put forth instead of something that is totally ridiculous is a tight story about family and the lengths at which they are influenced. Cronenberg has put together a great film that practically flies through its runtime. Yes, the ending feels dragged out, but the rest of the film is fabulously put together.Mortensen is great as the conflicted, tragic hero Tom, and conveys excellent emotional strength that was only laughable before in The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Here, he does not let the audience even gleam a sense of truth from his expressions or body language as to whether he really is Joey or not. His take on Tom is as mesmerizing as it is great. Bello continues to be great in everything she does with Edie, who really is unsure of what to do with her family. Her powerhouse performance, coupled with the excellence of Mortensen, makes the film worthwhile on its own. Newcomer Holmes proves himself worthy of being in the same picture as these two, and is awestriking as Jack. While he does not get nearly as much time to prove himself as the two kids do in The Squid and the Whale, another albeit much less violent film about the crumbling family unit, he does adequately well in his short role. Harris only continues his tremendously great acting with his role here. He is strong and elusively evil as Fogarty, and makes an excellent contrast to Mortensen's Tom. Hurt, while only being in such a small bit of the film, is excellent as Richie. Not worthy of an Oscar nomination, but unusually strong for the strikingly short role that he has.If there is anything wrong with the film, it is the tight editing of it. As said, it flies right through until the end, where it slows down heavily right before finishing. A little bit of a change of pace here may have made the film a bit stronger than it already is. As well, with it being so different than the graphic novel, Cronenberg only leaves a hint of Tom's past for us to know. He instead, makes it totally enigmatic, and makes us imagine it for ourselves. It's a great element to use, but it takes away many of his motivations as a character, and does not leave us fully satisfied by the finale. He had a strong film, with a great story and fabulous performances, but it just seems like he did not want to have anything more.Violence is a great film with even better performances. It is a definite must-see film, and is probably the most commercial film we will ever see out of Cronenberg. Yes, he added his own trademark touches to it, but in turn, he left out parts that may have made the film even stronger than it already is.8.5/10.",A History of Violence
137,rajdoctor,A History of Violence,6,29 December 2007,"I had seen Eastern Promises after reading good reviews of this movie; but only after seeing Eastern Promises, I got a chance to see this movie which was actually released in 2005.The story is about a simple married man Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) working in a bar in a small town in US. In an act to save a woman in his bar from psycho murderers, he shoots them to become a local hero. His images and tale of bravery is broadcasted in all the news. This results in a mafia gang led by Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris) approaching Tom with proof of an identity of Tom  which no ones knows about. Does Tom really have a violent past life? Will the revelation save Tom's marriage and family? There is a small sub-plot of Tom's son and bullying done by his classmates.Having heard a lot of praise of this movie, I found the movie good but not too praise worthy. The narration was slow  the sexual content between Tom and his wife to depict their passionate love, was over the top a bit; mainly suiting to the western culture's need to have this doze.David Cornenberg has followed the script / screenplay faithfully, and thus its nomination for Oscars. The best parts of the movie are when David dwells into gruesome action scenes.The cinematography was soothing.Vigoo Mortensen has done a wonderful job in portraying the vulnerability and cold-bloodedness of his dual character. Ed Harris in a small role is efficient as ever.Honestly, it was more like a Van Dam movie made by Amritraj brothers.(Stars 6 out of 10)",A History of Violence
138,RossRivero99,A jaw droppingly great movie,10,27 July 2017,"I've always wanted to see David Cronenberg's ""A History of Violence"" for many years but when the opportunity presented itself to me and I watched it I knew it was going to be great, but at the same time it was far different than the movie I pictured but in a good way of course. The main character of this movie is Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) an ordinary working class man who lives in the town of Milbrook, Indiana with his wife Edie (Maria Bello) and their two children, and also owns a local diner which is non-coincidentally called ""Stall's diner"".However Stall's life changes when one night he is about to close up shop in his restaurant and two guys come in and try to rob the diner in order to get themselves more money that they didn't earn out of desperation because of being broke and due to the fact that they're threatening the lives of every single person in the restaurant Stall takes matters into his own hands killing both men and as a result he is hailed a hero for his actions, although he isn't very proud of what he did, which unveils a secret that he had concealed for 20 years which I will not spoil. After the failed robbery a mobster named Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris) comes into the restaurant with one of his men and tries telling him that his name isn't really Tom Stall but rather Joey Cusack and tries to make him remember his past by showing him scars on his face and that he is blind in one eye. There is another scene in the movie where Edie takes her daughter to the mall and she sees Fogarty again and he tells her to ask her husband a very shocking question which is spoiled by the trailer of which I won't mention. After dealing with Fogarty and his men for the last time Tom or Joey decides to drive to Philadelphia to meet his alleged brother Richie Cusack (William Hurt) who also happens to be a mobster, and after the meeting Tom goes back to his family and nobody knows what happens next. The movie is a nearly flawless adaptation John Wagner and Vince Locke's graphic novel (which I didn't read), and a brilliant Oscar nominated screenplay by Josh Olson, as well as Cronenberg's expert direction. Also with the performances are very good with standout work from Mortensen, Harris, and Hurt (who received an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor). The only problem that I had with the movie was Maria Bello's performance which wasn't very impressive to me and made me feel like another actress could have played the part of Edie Stall so much better than she did but then again that's just me. Mortensen's work is comparable to that of Robert Mitchum's performance in ""Out of the Past"" (1947) because in both movies the main characters deal with a troubled past and tried to keep it a secret but couldn't take it any longer. The performances given by both Harris and Hurt compare among the greatest gangster portrayals in all of movie history along with Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello in ""The Departed"" (2006), James Cagney's Cody Jarrett in ""White Heat"" (1949), Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone in ""The Godfather"" (1972), Al Pacino's Michael Corleone throughout the entire ""Godfather"" series, Ray Liotta's Henry Hill in ""Goodfellas"" (1990), Daniel Day-Lewis's Bill ""the Butcher"" Cutting in ""Gangs of New York"" (2002) along with so many others. I wish this movie could have gotten more accolades at the Oscars than it did 11 years ago for example not only a supporting actor nomination for William Hurt, but there also could have been one for Ed Harris as well, along with a best actor nomination for Mortensen. This is a violent movie but however it isn't the most violent movie that I've ever seen, and is not suitable for younger viewers who want to watch it at home, which is why it got the R rating in the first place. This is one of the best crime thrillers that I've ever seen , as well as being one of the best films of 2005.",A History of Violence
139,PeterMitchell-506-564364,People do change,8,8 May 2013,"I liked the different direction Cronenberg went in, with this, followed by Eastern Promises. This is an impressive debut, in his out the horror zone of films. Viggo Mortennsen, an actor in high demand, gives another fine performance as a simple man, who could be hiding an ugly past as a fixer for the mob. Now running a cafe, he foils a robbery attempt, in one quite graphic scene concerning the poor SOB robber, who has half his face blown off. Now painted as a town hero, this could be the much recognition, he doesn't need. A seamy stranger, mob guy, (Ed Harris) suddenly shows up in town claiming to know Tom Stawell (Mortennsen) threatening to disclose his past, which Stawell heavily denies. Mario Bello, also impressive as Stawell's wife, stands by him, as more evidence comes to light which can't be overlooked. May'be he really was that bad man, who did all those terrible and hideous things to those poor souls. More convinced is another guy, who Stawell is brought to, played by an actor of high accolade, who was out of the celebrity light for a while, his performance worth waiting for, it's great to see his comeback in this thing. What gets you with A History Of Violence, is the thriller aspect, the need to know of Mortenssen's character. It's an highly engrossing movie, on that basis, with heavy bits of the latter of it's title, with Morttensen, just a superb actor to watch. Through watching him mostly play bad guys in early roles, I always found this uncomfortable aura about him. An early scene, where Bello leads an uncertain Viggo to a secluded spot for some, you know what, is cute.",A History of Violence
140,WriterDave,"The Worst Kind of Bad Movie, One that Everyone Involved Thought was Great",1,2 April 2006,"This is what is passing for entertainment at the art houses these days? Here we have perfect small-town family man Tom Stall, a guy so swell he still sixty-nines his loving and pretty wife after all these years, has a sensitive teen-age son who looks up to him in every way, and an angelic and bratty little girl who demands the entire family calm her fears after a bad dream about monsters in the closet. Then comes the scene where he has to save his diner from some low-life spree killers and he becomes an American hero. Some mobsters see him on TV and waltz into town presenting either the worst case of mistaken identity or Tom's violent past finally catching up to him.David Cronenberg's extremely low-key direction and Viggo Mortensen's lazy lead performance don't match at all the overwrought acting of everyone else involved (especially Maria Bello, who gives a wretched performance that for some reason was universally praised). The worst acting, however comes from Ed Harris and William Hurt, playing a pair of Philly mobsters in the type of scenery-chewing manner that screams ""hey, look at me, Ma, I'm ACTING!"" The film is further hampered by unrealistic dialogue, and a narrow-minded, and quite frankly idiotic, view of both small-town and city life, and a simpleton's perversion of family values. What was meant to be chilling and suspenseful is instead rendered to be overtly banal, and we the audience are left with the most overrated piece of cinematic garbage since ""In the Bedroom.""",A History of Violence
141,LoneWolfAndCub,"Disturbing, brilliant, but essential; Typical Cronenberg",9,19 August 2006,"A History of Violence is David Cronenberg's most recent film, it's also one of his best. The cast all give solid (some career best) performances, despite what a few people have written here. Howard Shore's score is brooding and as always, brilliant. Cronenberg directs this flawlessly, as he usually does.Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) and Edie (Maria Bello) live the perfect life with their two children. Until Tom brutally kills two gangsters at his Diner. He becomes a local hero and attracts the attention of Carl Foggarty (Ed Harris) who apparently knows him and his life before Tom Stall. Soon enough, everything spirals out of control.A History of Violence is one of the best movies of 2005. The reason I think it's ""essential"" is because of its take on violence in today's world. Tom becomes a local hero but for what, killing two people. Although they were ""evil,"" the local townspeople applaud him for what he has done. That seems to happen a lot, people congratulate someone else for an act of violence (in today's world). This might just be my personal interpretation of one of the many themes of the movie, but it is one of the reasons it is (to me) brilliant.Viggo Mortenson gives a career best performance and Maria Bello and Ed Harris also give outstanding performances. Shore's score is as always suited to the movie. This movie is recommended to fans of Cronenberg and people who want to see a brilliant modern drama.4½/5.",A History of Violence
142,OriginalMovieBuff21,"It was alright, nothing special",6,21 October 2005,"I was anticipated to see this movie for a long time, mainly because I am a big fan of Viggo Mortensen after he did The Lord of the Rinng films and to the point that a lot of critics were giving high reviews to this movie. So I saw the movie a couple weeks back and I actually disagreed to what many critics were hailing this as a must see movie. To me, at some points I thought the movie was flat. Most of the performances were too boring for me, which surprised me since I love Viggo Mortensen, but thought this performance of his was a yawner. The movie should of been a little longer, for that they needed more details instead of getting right to the action. I thought the movie went way to fast for me to get a better viewing of it. Besides all of the negative reviews, I thought Ed Harris played an excellent performance. His performance actually made the movie look more interesting. Overall, the movie wasn't as great as I thought it was going to be and like I said, they should've made it a little longer. It was an okay film but nothing special at all.Hedeen's Outlook: 5.5/10 ** D+",A History of Violence
143,johnnymonsarrat,"Jon Monsarrat review: like ""In the Bedroom"", more drama than action",5,2 August 2006,"I was hoping from the previews that A History of Violence would be more of an action flick, and there is some action in the movie. But the film takes itself very seriously, and it is really a heavy drama, like In the Bedroom. When I say heavy, what I mean is that there are many scenes with no plot movement but just deep with emotion -- I would not say melodramatic, but I have to admit a little boring.What's funny is that the action bits in the film are a bit like Payback with Mel Gibson. You know how the best action is a little larger than life, well it actually conflicts with the serious ultra-realistic drama to have some larger than life action mixed in. Although possibly this is an intentional shift since two worlds (pastoral and violent) are colliding in this film.Without spoiling the plot, for example, I can tell you that it takes a few minutes to drive somewhere in the movie, where there should have been just a cut. And after an initial ""bang"" opening, the film's setup goes on far too long before the premise kicks in.I have to say I enjoyed the film, barely, but two things undercut my enjoyment. Again without spoiling the plot, let me just say vaguely that I wasn't drawn to empathize with the main character based on what he's done in his life. Finally the film's main theme is family harmony during a crisis and the ending did not resolve the main question there for me. I hate when films do that. I don't need a Hollywood Ending but you can't set me up to care deeply about a fictional character and then pull the rug out under me with this ""Tiger and the Lady"" business.I really wanted to rate this film higher but I'm forced to give it a lackluster 5 out of 10.",A History of Violence
144,SquigglyCrunch,"Largely Mediocre, but it Had it's Moments",6,3 December 2016,"A History of Violence follows a father who supposedly had a history with some mysterious people who arrive in his town. They begin to pursue him, and he and his family have to deal with them. One standout of this movie is the violence itself. It's underglorified quite a bit, and it really works with the movie and the tone it's trying to set. Throughout the movie I actually found myself questioning it, whether or not the men pursuing Mortensen's character did know him or had the wrong guy. It ends up going for the predictable route, which was disappointing, but it did okay with the unclear build up. The story itself is pretty generic, and while that isn't a bad thing, it doesn't do much about that. It handles it's plot in a way that one might expect, and falls short as a result. There were a handful of moments throughout the movie where I thought ""Wow, that was really good"" and then 4 seconds later it was back to mediocrity. The writing and presentation just wasn't all that unique, and frankly it was uninteresting. The movie takes about an hour to get going, and for a 95 minute movie that could prove problematic. In this case, that is true. The movie drags for at least a full 60 minutes before anything really impactful happens, leaving about 35 minutes for it to wrap itself up, and it rushes. The climax is so quick and anti-climatic. And with the dragged out hour of almost nothing I was nowhere near invested. A rushed climax didn't help that. Also William Hurt got an Oscar nomination for this movie. Is he in it? Not really, he's an extra at best. He has a role for about 10 minutes of the climax, maybe less, and his performance is nothing short of okay. This isn't a flaw with the movie, but rather just an expression of my frustration. I can't believe this guy got an Oscar nomination for saying a few (emphasis on 'a few') lines and walking around a little. He doesn't even do anything in the movie, and it makes me so frustrated when the Academy pulls stuff like this. Overall A History of Violence is an unconventional movie done completely wrong. It's drawn out to an almost boring degree, and the vast majority of it is generic, with the exception of the violence, some of the build up, and just a few miscellaneous points here and there. In the end I wouldn't recommend this movie.",A History of Violence
145,PIST-OFF,Darwinian melodrama,7,21 September 2006,"A History of violence is good film that suffers greatly from miscasting. Of the things I liked about it were the motif of Darwinian principles of survival of the fittest, which often unfortunately happens to coincide with survival of the meanest. The hierarchal nature of where someone sits in terms of their will to destroy is evident in the scene in which the cliché'd high school bully runs across the traveling killers. The message is clear, a rottweiler is a dangerous animal in small town but it probably wouldn't last long on the Serengeti.The violence is done in a fantastically frank manner and i'm sure several scenes of violence probably served as a great hook for bringing the material to mainstream viewers.My main problem with the film comes from the casting which i believe was all wrong. Viggo Mortensen plays his parts perfectly well as the Capra-esquire small town man, but in act, manner, and look he seem ill fitting for the roll. Ed Harris come pretty close but even he seems a tad off. And my biggest problem as usual is with William Hurt who never manages to act well. Here, Hurt seems to be doing more caricature of his roll then acting in it. Maria Bello also seems a bit out of place and glamorous for bumpkin's wife, but then again few would be willing to watch a couple sex scenes involving people with average physiques.My other problem is that the rolls of several parts seem to be set up especially cliché'd in order to make the twist seem more profound, but instead the twist becomes expected because no high school bully is THAT stereotypically mean. No happily married couple is THAT blissful and ignorant and impassioned on a moment to moment basis. It seems as though we watch one dimensional characters unfold into two dimensional characters when i think with more attention to detail we could have had three dimensional characters morph into other three dimensional characters beyond all out expectations.7 out of 10",A History of Violence
146,MichaelMargetis,"""You should ask Tom... Why is he so good at killing people? "" - Carl Fogarty",9,30 September 2005,"I've heard nothing but positive things from film critics about off-the-wall indie filmmaker David Croenenberg's new film 'A History of Violence'. Going into the theater showing this I expected it to be an excellent movie. Coming out of the film, I have to say I wasn't let down in the slightest. 'A History of Violence' is a work of masterful crafting that has deep and very intelligent elements to it. Croenenberg is a talented filmmaker who makes very good films, and 'A History of Violence' is his very best thus far. Expect this not to be forgotten when it comes time to be Oscar season.The story takes place in a small-town in the Midwest, Indiana to be exact. It follows the local diner owner, Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen - Lord of the Rings) who has the seemingly perfect family; a beautiful but spunky wife, Edie (Maria Bello - Assault on Precinct 13), a bright and passive 16-year-old son, Jack (Ashton Holmes) and a sweet little seven or eight-year-old daughter Sarah (Heidi Hayes). Tom's life is pretty average, until one night he has unexpected customers in his diners -- a duo of malicious and ruthless serial killers who attempt to rob and murder Tom and his employees. In an act of desperation, Tom fends off the eager villains murdering them both and the media and town hails him as a hero. Tom's life is turned upside down by this, but it really starts to get sour when a band of Irish mobsters from Philly led by the creepy dead-eyed Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris - Pollock) start to harass Tom and his family claiming that Tom is really a run-away mobster by the name of Joey Cusack. Fogarty and his gang keep harassing Tom and his loved ones, and Tom's family as well as the audience is left to decide if Fogarty has the wrong man by some unbelievably unlucky turn of events or if Tom is really this brutal ex-con Fogarty claims him to be. I will not tell you what it ends up being, but I can tell you the film gets incredibly tense and suspenseful after this point. William Hurt co-stars in a ten-minute role as the head mobster that is after Tom.'A History of Violence' isn't an extravagant motion picture and it doesn't break ground, but it is very carefully put together and the performances from every actor involved are nothing short of bone-chilling. Viggo Mortensen, in his finest role so far, gives an undeniably powerful and multi-layered performance as Tom Stall or Joey Cusack (which ever you believe), while Maria Bello (also in her finest performance) is utterly sublime as Tom's caring yet wild wife. Ashton Holmes gives an electrifying performance as Tom's troubled son, but the two best performances of the film come from the two veteran actors Ed Harris and William Hurt. Harris is so repugnant and terrifyingly convincing in his role as the cold-blooded Fogarty that his screen presence will give you goose-bumps, while Hurt is so superlative and unmatched in his part he proves that even a ten-minute role in a ninety-minute film can be the stand-out element of the entire motion picture. Croenenberg does a pitch-perfect job directing, while the film editing and cinematography is top of the line. Josh Olson screenplay is powerful but has some pacing problems in the first twenty minutes (not including the stunning five-minute opener). All in all, I'd have to highly recommend 'A History of Violence'. Those who enjoy well-made films should appreciate this, but if you are weary of sex or violence you might want to sit this one out. While there is only about four scenes of violence in the film, those four scenes are all very brutal, disturbing and realistic and might upset weak-stomached movie-goers. There is a rather graphic mutual rape scene between Tom and his wife when she suspects him of really being the stone-cold gangster Joey Cusack, that will upset more uptight or older viewers. I recommend this film only if you can handle the disconcerting realism and emotional power the film forces down your throat. One of the Best Films of the Year so far.

From the gay-cowboy movie ""Brokeback Mountain"" to the less acclaimed and preachy 'racism is bad' flick ""Crash,"" there were a lot of good movies and there were some that deserved much better attention. And I'm talking about A History of Violence. It was 2005 acclaimed movie where despite not receiving any big awards except for best supporting actor and adapted screenplay nomination at the Academy Awards, the film was most critics pick of best film of the year from Peter Travers (Rolling Stone), Larry Ratliff (San Antonio Express News) and Entertainment Weekly while others such as Joel Siegel of Good Morning America, Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune, Jonathan Rossembuam of Chicago Reader, Richard Roeper of Ebert and Roeper and others calling it a masterpiece and placing it on their list as well.Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen of Lord of the Rings) couldn't ask for a better life. He owns a coffee shop in a small part of town where he married his high school sweetheart (Maria Bello) along with having two children where there's nothing more he can ask for. One night two strangers from out of town want to rob Tom's coffee shop where even before a shoot out takes place, Tom kills the two suspects and becomes a local hero to the city.As days go by and Tom is still be lauded as the hero, a group of men come to the restaurant and call Tom ""Joey"" where not even the hero has a clue on what they're talking about along with information that he was once a hit-man killing people. The pieces of the puzzle come together as Tom's family realizes that their bread and butter is not the person he is.The film is under 100 minutes, but those minutes are well spent with a top notch cast including Ed Harris as a hit-man harassing Tom's family and best supporting actor nominee William Hurt as a crime boss who wants to see Tom.It's a don't miss kind of movie along with being one of the better films of 2005.",A History of Violence

I don't much care for violence but I thought maybe the movie would use the violence to make some deeper statement. I'm not sure that it accomplished that. I really am not sure what Cronenberg was trying to say and I have to admit that if this movie had been cast with different actors it would have been panned by the critics and dismissed as predictable and raunchy garbage. But with this great cast the movie is elevated maybe more than it should be. Don't get me wrong I think the story has merit but the conclusion was incomplete for incompleteness sake. It should have gone on because it was important to see what happened to these people. We know that the couple(Tom and Eddie) will never be the same. But what about the towns people and the children. It's important to see violence's total effect and that wasn't done. So that's why I'm undecided and maybe that's the point. Just as another note I'm glad that Cronenberg decided that not all of the shooting victims needed to be seen- good sense he drew the line somewhere.",A History of Violence

Then after seeing him on the news, a gang from Philadelphia come looking for him believing he is someone they knew years ago that they have a history with and want revenge.The movie was pretty slow in places. But the fighting scenes were really good. There were some very graphic violence scenes which looked good on screen.The film kept me guessing all the way through, I was wondering if he was this ex gangster they think he is, if it is did he lose his memory, do the gangsters have the wrong person etc...It stars Viggo Mortensen as the main character. I am not a big fan of his, but he did a pretty good job in this movie. He played the part convincingly. All the way though the movie I thought his wife was played by Charlize Theron, but I was wrong. The actress that plays her is Maria Bello. They look so much alike to me. She did a good job mostly. I thought the scenes when she was crying were not very convincing, but apart from that she did well.There is also a little side story which involves the son in the family and a bully from his school. This also adds to the story and is very good.I give this film 7 out of 10...

153,moviemanMA,Intense,8,10 October 2005,"Graphic novels are becoming quite popular in the movie industry these days. The release of Frank Miller's Sin City really brought it to a whole new level. Hookers, guns, sex, drugs, and just about any other controversial topic you can think of is covered by the genre. Now there is a new idea in the graphic novel system. What if the violence was brought to the home front? What if it came to your own town?A History of Violence is just that. The graphic novel written by John Wagner and Vince Locke is now brought to you on the big screen by director David Cronnenberg. It stars Viggo Mortensen as Tom Stall, a small town guy who runs a local diner. His wife Edie, played by Maria Bello, is his devoted, loving, and passionate wife. Their two kids Jack and Sarah are the perfect children to complete the perfect family. Everything seems to be going great until trouble rolls into town.It's a late night at Stall's Diner and these two unsavory characters enter demanding coffee and pie even though it is after hours. When it appears that all they really want is the money in the register, Tom agree's because he doesn't any trouble. When one of the goons assaults the waitress, Tom snaps. With cat-like reflexes he breaks the coffee pot off the side of one of the mans head. Seeing the other reach for his gun, he takes the other man's gun and unloads several rounds into the man's chest. The other goon, now on the floor, stabs Tom in the foot with a knife. Tom let's out a yelp and answers the man with a bullet through the skull. Tom winds up becoming a hero, receiving recognition all over television for his heroic deeds.Tom on the other hand wants this all to go behind him. When another group of gangsters pull up into town a few days later asking Tom more questions, Tom really is unnerved. They repeatedly call him Joey and Tom just thinks they saw him on the news and confused him with some other guy they knew back from Philidelphia where they say they came from. Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris) is the gangster looking to out Tom or ""Joey"" and take him back ""home"". It seems that they won't leave until they get an answer or Tom.The movie really sets itself apart from all other graphic novels by encompassing a small atmosphere mixed with the hard nosed gangster life. Mortensen and Bello's performances perfectly feed off of each others emotions and really make the story seem like it could happen. Is Tom a former hit-man, or is he just a face matched with the wrong name? This small town family's is getting turned upside down.The movie definitely deserves it's MPAA rating of R. Their are very intense, emotional scenes and graphic sequences of violence and sexual intercourse. Going into this movie not knowing that it is based on a graphic novel will really kill the mood you get from it and leave you in disgust. This isn't for the weak stomached. The action scenes are very well done and involve extremely realistic effects.A History of Violence is a brilliant movie that will have you on the edge of your seat from first frame to last. The cast is spectacular and deserves much recognition. Although it is just short of an hour and forty minutes long it still conveys a great plot, climax, and ending. Fans of the graphic novel will not be let down this time. A History of Violence will keep you on your toes...",A History of Violence
154,Flagrant-Baronessa,An interesting study of violence,8,29 July 2006,"The title 'A History of Violence' almost suggests a thesis study of violence and, to some extent, it is. It makes effective statements about how you can't change who you are or your violent nature, and it approaches these statements in an interesting and careful way. I think the juxtaposition of the quiet calm of a family's life with graphic disturbing images of violence is a stroke of genius on Cronenberg's part. I also think that all the performances in this film hold up well, in particular Viggo Mortensen who superbly handles his part as a criminal-turned-family man.So, 'A History of Violence' is certainly an interesting piece of cinema, coloured with typically gory Cronenberg visuals and glazed with tense moods throughout. At its core, however, is a simple peaceful American family portrayed by Maria Bello, Ashton Holmes and Viggo Mortensen and this family is the case study in the thesis that is 'A History of Violence'. We see how their father's violent past sneaks up on them and changes them and it is painful for the viewer.While I can see that the film is a well-crafted thriller, it felt a little unengaging at times -- all mood and no culminations made it feel longer than it was (and it's less than 100 minutes long).",A History of Violence

One thing is that the violence is graphic and realistic, it's not over the top violence it's psychical. People getting beaten and shot, no extreme action like jumping out of cars and all that just normal violence. The drama in the film is also powerful like the relationship between the family before, during and after the incident.

156,majikstl,History lessened,3,30 March 2006,"There are times when you watch a movie and the flow of the story comes to an abrupt halt because some character does something that just doesn't make sense. Sometimes the film overcomes this bit of illogic, though more often it just derails the film's credibility completely because it inadvertently reminds you that you are, indeed, watching a movie. David Cronenberg's A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE is an endless stream of such moments when characters' behaviors just don't ring true. One false move after another renders what could have been a passable thriller into being little more than a violent soap opera.The story finds Viggo Mortensen playing Tom Stalls, a small-town café owner whose peaceable bucolic life is shattered when he thwarts a holdup in his folksy little establishment. His bravery, resulting in the well-deserved deaths of a couple of traveling serial killers (who inexplicably, but conveniently pick Tom's place for a stick up), gains him unwanted national notoriety and the even more unwanted attention of a mobster who claims that Tom is really Joey Cusack, an MIA Philadelphia gangster. It could be a case of mistaken identity, or else Tom's unsavory past is catching up with him -- just as it has with all manner of gangsters, escaped cons, gunslingers and fugitive Nazi war criminals who hide in plain sight in picturesque little movie towns.This film wants to play itself as sort of a PULP FICTION comes to Mayberry RFD. But while Cronenberg's vision of picture postcard Medford, Indiana is archetypically American enough (though actually filmed in Canada), his villains are pure central casting stereotypes. Gangster Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris) is such a trite caricature that when he shows up out of the past to confront Stalls, you expect him to step out of his black limo wearing a pinstriped suite and a white fedora while carrying a violin case concealing a tommy gun. Meanwhile, in an annoying subplot, Tom's teenage son, Jack (Ashton Holmes) is harassed by the school bully who seems like a juvenile delinquent straight out of a 50s Hot-Rods-from-Hell B-movie. The bad guys in the film are supposed to be menacing, but we've seen them so many times they come off as unfunny jokes.But the transparent villainy of the bad guys is rock solid compared to the unfolding story; everyone is stupid, or at the mercy of the stupid screenplay, based tellingly on a comic book. Knowing that thugs are after him, Tom still walks to work alone along miles of desolate country roads. His wife is informed that the thugs may be heading to their isolated country house, but she doesn't call the police, let alone lock the front door. Despite numerous opportunities to quietly kill or kidnap Tom, the bad guys only confront him in public places. And worse, though Tom repeatedly risks his life to protect his family, his wife and son turn against him at the drop of a plot twist (how better to show that the prototypical happy American family is an illusion!).Under the guidance of a Hitchock or another such director who could have shown some dramatic irony or a wicked sense of satirical humor (as well as demanding a rewrite), this could have been a decent enough suspense drama. But director David Cronenberg opts instead to play the story with the deadpan desensitized chill so prevalent in this Tarantino age of pseudo-hip sadism. He seems intent to do what has become the norm, subtly glamorize violence as a commonplace impulse in a mundane world, simultaneously pretending to condemn brutality, while giving it backhanded approval as part of the norm. Of course, such violence is commonplace, but only in hypocritical films like this.A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, like KILL BILL or RESERVOIR DOGS or THE WILD BUNCH or NATURAL BORN KILLERS or GOODFELLAS or dozens of other critic's darlings, isn't about the evils of violence, but about the adrenaline rush of its own sadism. It doesn't comment on a violent society, but perpetuates that violence in the society. There isn't even a film if you remove the violence; it is one contrived and phony situation after another, all made to build to an act of gore. There is no great suspense. There is no character development. It is like an old Hollywood musical where a silly story is used as filler between musical production numbers. Everything in this film exists solely so we can see graphic scenes of people being slaughtered -- or in one disturbing and unrealistic scene, violent sex.In violent films like this, the director, actors and special effects people, as well as the stuntmen, the make up people, cinematographer and editor, all work together to make violent actions as cinematically jazzed up as possible. Filmmakers may spout the politically correct nonsense about how they are trying to reveal the horrible brutality of violence, but they work to create violent scenes that function as orgasms. We don't see the consequences of the senseless violence, because that would negate the ain't-it-cool impact of each burst of mayhem. If there is a consequence to the violence it is only to set things up for more violence later. Yet the violence begets violence moral of films like this is as sanctimonious and shallow as it is obvious and ultimately meaningless.",A History of Violence

With his face plastered all over the news, Stall is then mistaken for a long lost, thought to be dead, bad guy from Philly by some mafia characters including Fogarty (Harris) that won't leave him alone. Some great acting along with some questionable plot spins make this an interesting film for those that don't mind a little shoot-em-up.

158,gsygsy,"excellent, but not for the kiddies",10,6 October 2005,"This is, like all Cronenberg's work, a mythic movie. It occupies the world of ""monsters"" that Tom Stall's daughter dreams about at the start. It's as if we get to see the little girl's nightmare as the film unfolds. It's because of this poetic, super-real quality that criticisms from the ""this isn't real life"" brigade have no relevance. The screenplay is exceptionally tight and well-woven - no image is wasted. The subplot of the son's troubles with a school bully parallels the main plot. The very existence of the son is there to show the inheritance - the history - of violence. The sex scenes are there to show the proximity of lust and violence. The end can be nothing other than what it is: as someone else on IMDb has commented, the genie is out of the bottle. This is true for the family in the film, the society we see surrounding the family, and it's true for our families and our society. It's about the inexhaustible rage of humans. It couldn't be more relevant, it couldn't be more timeless. It is well acted and beautifully photographed. I have some minor reservations - did we really need so much of Howard Shore's music? - but on the whole I think this is a superb film. Not for the kiddies, however.",A History of Violence
159,supertom-3,Film of the year! As of 10/10/05,10,11 October 2005,"In a career that has been primarily based in weird horror films, with questions of reality and psychoses, David Cronenberg hits pure gold with perhaps his most conventional piece. This is a gripping thriller with some trademark Cronenberg excess in violence and gore, and with questions of identity. However it is also a fascinating look at the idea of violence and it's effect on people. It has Cronenberg's trademark ambiguity but never going to the depths of confusion he so loves to force upon us in films like Videodrome and Spider. Cronenberg has done some great films but I feel as an overall piece this film ranks as his best. Certainly it will be his most widely popular film. Not as confusing as his films like Videodrome, and not as gruesome and unpleasant as his films like The Fly.The film focuses on small town family man and all round nice guy Tom Stall. He's mild mannered and respected and has a gorgeous wife and two kids. He's a lucky guy. However one night as he closes his diner, two slimy criminals who have been cruising through small towns, raping, robbing and killing, enter and demand to be served. They become agitated and soon it is clear they are up to no good as the grab a female co-worker of Tom's and look like they are going to dishonour her. The two men are armed but in a moment of distraction, Tom turns into an action man and manages to kill both men, seemingly in defence of himself, his workers and frightened diners. Tom becomes a local and national hero but his face sprawled all over national news brings about a decidedly slimy visitor to the town, Fogarty played superbly by Ed Harris. He seems to believe that Tom is in fact called Joey, and from Philadelphia, and the same Joey who happened to give Fogarty a rather gruesome eye. Fogarty and his two sidekicks seem threatening and Tom is clearly worried for his families safety, while Tom's wife begins pondering just what Fogarty is claiming about Tom formerly being known as a rather nasty character called Joey. As Fogarty says to Edie ""How come he's so good at killing people?"" Her questions heighten during a face off between Tom and Fogarty that yet again leaves Tom standing amongst a trail of bloodshed. Soon it emerges that Tom is in fact Joey. Yet the audience is never really told whether he is suffering from a from of schizophrenia that has begun to release the Joey side of his personality, the violent streak if you like, or simply he has plain old lied for the last 20 or so years.The film is blessed with a fantastic cast. Viggo Mortenson is superb as Tom. He gives a commanding performance which also shows subtlety with the change in character from Tom to Joey. Similar to Jeremy Northam in cult sci-fi movie Cypher as he begins to take on a change of identity. That was also a performance of great depth. I use Cypher as an example as director Vincenzo Natali did Cube, a film admired by Cronenberg. The way his character shifts is subtle and engaging while also keeping an ambiguity. We are never entirely sure whether Tom is acting or whether he is mentally switching personalities. Also excellent is Maria Bello as Edie, Tom's wife. She is excellent. Also very good is Ashton Holmes as Tom's son, and it is interesting to see how Tom's sudden rise to town hero, effects the similarly once mild mannered son. Then of course there is Ed Harris who is superb in his supporting role, however the one who really is the showstopper is the fantastic William Hurt as Joey's brother. Hurt pops up for all of 10 minutes but is absolutely commanding and a very good candidate for best supporting actor at the Oscars. In fact Mortenson and Bello are also certainly worthy of nods, however being that this film is not really conventional Oscar fodder it goes without saying it will likely, and unfairly, be completely ignored, while something as critically split down the middle as Oliver Twist is garnering buzz, despite being as much disappointing to critics and moviegoers as it is well received.Cronenberg is on fine form, pacing the film magnificently and making it look excellent, while the flourishes of violence are exceptionally done and suitably grim. Howard Shore also provides a fantastic score, one of the best this year, certainly a score that should not be ignored come Oscar season. Overall this is as of October, film of the year. *****",A History of Violence
160,dead47548,Cronenberg crafts another masterpiece.,10,25 January 2008,"A stunning portrayal of a beautiful family torn apart by the father's dark past. The first act does a fine job of establishing the close bond between the Stall family before the second act comes along and stirs everything up. Josh Olson's Oscar-nominated screenplay does the perfect job of leaving the truth about Tom a mystery until it's finally revealed. The audience isn't really sure if he's this ruthless mobster that Fogarty claims he is or if he really is the simple family man that we came to admire in the first act.As always with Cronenberg, the violence is some of the most expertly crafted I've ever seen. He takes his usual no-bullshit approach and makes it more realistic than his over-the-top gore of the 80s. Everything is brutal and cringe-worthy as we see flesh peeling off onto the floor and a nose slammed back into a man's skull. Of course the fact that it's one of immensely few films to use sex as a means of character development only furthers it's genius. In fact the only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the son's story. Yes, it was vital to the film and I would complain more had it not shown the family's reaction to Tom's past aside from Edie but the whole ""bully beats up the geek and geek fights back thing"" was very clichéd and not well acted.Outside of that though, the film is flawlessly performed by everyone. Viggo Mortensen sheds his Lord of the Rings-persona that everyone had come to know him by and creates one of the most remarkable, complex inner portrayals of the decade. His subtle anguish is breathtaking. Maria Bello and Ed Harris also shine significantly. And William Hurt completely deserved his Oscar nomination for his brief appearance on screen which had me laughing my head off and gripping my hands in fear for Tom. A History of Violence is a gritty, family drama meshed with a ruthless thriller and it exceeds magnificently.",A History of Violence
161,christian123,It wasn't as good as I thought it would be but it's still better than most movies from 2005,7,5 May 2006,"Viggo Mortensen plays Tom Stalls, a pillar of a small town community who runs a diner and lives a happy and quiet life with his wife (Maria Bello) and two children. But their lives are forever changed when Mortensen thwarts an attempted robbery and is lauded as a hero by the media, attracting the attention of some mobsters (William Hurt and Ed Harris) who believe he is someone else. A History of Violence is far from one of the best films of 2005. It was pretty underwhelming to watch because I had heard such great things about it. It wasn't a bad movie, just a disappointing one. The story was pretty interesting but it was all just a bit too straightforward and predictable. There really weren't any surprises. However, David Cronenberg does a really good job directing the film. Even the simplest scene had some importance to the message of the film. Every scene was nicely shot, its just too bad that the rest of the film wasn't as good. The reason the film isn't as good as it should be is because of the acting. Viggo Mortensen gives a very poor performance as Tom. He's very mundane, very wooden, just not right for the role. He was okay in the Lord of the Rings trilogy because he wasn't the main focus. Maria Bello actually gives a decent performance. It wasn't Oscar worthy or anything but still pretty good. Ed Harris gives a rather bland performance. It wasn't bad or anything just a bit too ordinary and I expected more from him. William Hurt gives the best performance out of the entire cast. Too bad he's in the film for about ten minutes. While the performance is pretty good, it didn't deserve an Oscar nomination because it was so short. Ashton Holmes takes the cake for the worst performance out of everyone though. His performance is so unconvincing and wooden. When he wasn't being wooden, he was just very uninteresting and bland. Why did they hire this guy? I could name so many better actors that could have pulled off the role and the role wasn't even complex.Unfortunately, Ashton Holmes actually gets his own subplot. He plays Jack Stall and lets just say that he isn't the strongest kid at school. He gets picked on constantly by this bully name Bobby. The whole subplot was just a waste of time and it was hard to feel sorry for Jack because his character was so unlikable. Even the scene where he eventually fights back and puts Bobby in the hospital was underwhelming. For the most part, the film was pretty realistic. The fight scenes weren't too bloody or over the top. The screenplay was very good and interesting. The direction was sharp and strong. The score wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. The ending was actually pretty good and strong. I thought it ended the film perfectly even if it was a little unrealistic. The only thing I didn't like about this film was the acting and some of the dialog was really lame and weak. In the end, A History of Violence is worth checking out. It just wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Rating 7.3/10",A History of Violence
162,theshadow908,Too short with minimal plot.,4,5 May 2006,"When A History of Violence first came out, it was being praised as an excellent film from film making genius David Cronenberg. When I heard it was based off a graphic novel, I was even more eager to see it. I ended up waiting until it came on pay per view to watch it. I sat down, all excited...What a waste of 96 minutes. I suppose I should be thankful that the movie was so short, but that's part of the reason it was bad. It didn't have enough time to have actual plot points. My friend even told me that when he was watching it with friends, he left the room for a couple of minutes, came back in to find the credits rolling, and thought they had fast forwarded it.David Cronenberg is a good director with some great movies like The Dead Zone or The Fly. However, I didn't see any of his usual spark in this film at all. Most of the actors in the film, like Viggo Mortensen, Mario Bello, William Hurt and Ed Harris are really good actors. Yet in this movie they didn't even try. Viggo Mortensen was so terrible in some scenes that I laughed at his performance. The lack of a plot was unbearable. Instead of watching the movie, you could just read my very elaborate description of the movie...A guy runs a coffee shop. He saves his coffee shop from robbers and becomes a hero. The mob tracks him down. Guy kills his mafia don brother.The only good thing about this movie is that the violent scenes are so realistic that they are groundbreaking in the art of movie making.4/10",A History of Violence
163,room102,2005 - The Sell-out year?,5,12 October 2005,"2005 turns out to be a year of sell-outs by the greatest directors. For me, it started with Terry Gilliam making ""The Brothers Grimm"" after the collapse of ""The Man who Killed Don Quixote"". It continued with James Cameron giving us ""Aliens of the Deep"" - a boring and extremely shallow documentary that looks more like an unedited ""behind the scenes"" featurette (read my full review on the movie for more details). And now - David Cronenberg giving us ""A History of Violence"". Oh, and I haven't seen yet Atom Egoyan's ""Where the Truth Lies"" - which is said to be his most commercial mainstream movie yet.But let's start at the beginning. David Cronenberg is one of my favorite directors. Movies like ""Dead Ringers"", ""The Fly"", ""Spider"" and ""Crash"" appear high on my ""all-time favorite"" list. Having a unique point-of-view, deep analysis, dealing with subjects that are far away from the mainstream interest - to name a few - can easily put him under the definition of an ""auteur"" in any dictionary.Naturally, having such high anticipations from your favorite director and expecting such a high standard are almost a guaranteed disappointment. But I was *not* disappointed with ""Spider"" (here again - read my full review on the movie for more details).""A History of Violence"", on the other hand, is a big disappointment for me. For the high standard I expect from Cronenberg, I can say it's his worst movie in years. I write this review after just having watched the movie; will I change my mind after a second viewing? Possibly. Maybe Cronenberg's commentary will reveal some more depth that I failed to realize.Like Gilliam, who was forced to compromise his values a little and make a commercial movie in order to make some money, Cronenberg also had to make a commercial movie - he is quoted as saying this himself. I sincerely don't blame either of them. An auteur who takes such huge risks and makes such non-commercial movies for years, is ""allowed"" in my opinion to make a commercial movie once in a while in order to get paid for his work.Cronenberg worked for two years on ""Spider"" and wasn't paid anything for it. While Hollywood flooded the market with piles of cheesy movies - Cronenberg was one of the few to risk everything and give us something special. If what Cronenberg or Gilliam need, in order to finance their next ""real"" movie, is to make a commercial movie right now - then so be it. It doesn't make them any lesser directors and it doesn't indicate a lack of talent. Their resume contains enough material to justify their status.Having said that, I'm going to contradict myself a bit here. During his career up until now, Cronenberg never *seemed* to have to compromise. During the years he turned down (for various reasons) many offers for movies that were almost guaranteed to become huge hits (""Return of the Jedi"", ""Beverly Hills Cop"", ""Top Gun"" - just to name a few). But instead he chose to continue with low-budget and non-commercial movies. Why did he choose to break this tradition now? Is it because ""Spider"" was such a huge project? Is it because after all these years he seeks some recognition for his work from the mainstream audience (not to mention Oscar-buzz rumors)? Is it because he wants a taste of the ""easy"" life of making a simple movie?After the first view, ""A History of Violence"" doesn't seem to me like a real Cronenberg movie. The body/mind-orientation, which is so vivid in (almost) all of his other movies hardly exists and I didn't feel his special magic here.For me it was funny to see that from the very first moment of the movie. Cronenberg ALWAYS opens his movies with a main titles sequence before the actual movie begins. This is an important issue for Cronenberg, who claims the sequence transfers the audience from the real-world into the atmosphere of the movie. Putting the credits while the movie already starts reminds him of the way TV shows, which are relatively short, are made in order to rush things. I'm sure most people (even big fans of Cronenberg) wouldn't be aware of this issue and wouldn't notice the breaking of this rule in ""A History of Violence"", but for me it was (rightfully or not) like a hidden message from Cronenberg, saying: ""This is not a real Cronenberg movie; this IS a commercial movie"". Maybe I'm just imagining things...I don't think the movie is bad. It's just not what I expect from Cronenberg. There were lots of disappointment for me here: The acting, the writing, the direction and maybe even master-Shore's music (I definitely need to give a few listens to the music before deciding this). None of them was bad; they were just average. And *I* want a lot more than ""average"". Cronenberg usually brings out the best of every aspect: writing, acting, cinematography, music, etc.Maybe a second view of the movie - this time without all the anticipation - will be more enjoyable. In either case, I hope Cronenberg's next movie will be back in his familiar territory, far away from commercial material.My rating (after the first view): 6/10.",A History of Violence
164,tastyhotdogs,Huh?,7,3 September 2006,"Had been waiting to see this for a while. Looked like it would kind of be like ""High Crimes"", a solid action/drama.The movie is about Tom Stall, a local diner owner in a quiet country town. Life is pretty simple and straight forward for Tom until one day someone attempts to hold up the diner. These thiefs mean business but brave Tom manages to control the situation and kill the thiefs. Tom is hailed a local hero, the business picks up and things are going great until a few mysterious men show up, claiming Tom is actually a man named Joey from Philadelphia. As events unfold it seems these men might be right...or are they? A solid movie which had me guessing for the first half, but then went really odd and went off to a strange place, which is annoying as it had real potential.

166,nobbytatoes,one exceptional film,9,9 March 2006,"It has been awhile since David Croneberg has made, in a sense, a main stream film. Croneberg's last film to have main stream appeal was 1986's great horror film The Fly. Between The Fly and A History of Violence, Croneberg's film has made great films; Dead Ringer, Naked Lunch and eXistenZ being highlights, though they all have held a withdrawing and distancing element. A History of Violence isn't so much as a return to form, but brings back the recognition of David Croneberg.In an idyllic slice of Americana, Tom Stall happily live in the quiet town of Millbrook. Everyone knows your name, the streets are clean, its a perfect sleepy little town. Tom has a loving wife Edie, his son Jack and young daughter Sarah. Life seems all too perfect; in one scene with the whole family consoling Sarah after a bad dream, and Edie dressing in a cheerleaders costume for sex. One night at Tom's dinner, two violent strangers plan to rob the store. While the two stranger both hold guns, Tom kills both men; in a brutal manner. The town call Tom a hero and praise his act of defence. With his name all over the news, another stranger come to town, Carl Fogarty. Carl starts accusing Tom of being someone else, Tom holding his defence that he doesn't know of this other person. As Carl starts to push Tom other identity, Edie and Jack doubt who Tom is and whether he has a violent history.A History of Violence is such a brilliant film from David Croneberg. Croneberg has been know for his exploration of flesh and sex, though as his 'flesh horror' isn't as strong here as in his previous films, his exploration of sex still remains; with two very contrasting sex scenes. Though it shows that Croneberg is dealing with more than the flesh this time. In the opening sequence of the two strangers killing occupants at a motel, creates so much dread, especially with the easement they take to kill a young girl. The notion of vengeance and violence of society is deeply explored by Croneberg; with some very confronting violence. When Tom's son Jack violently bashes two other boys in school, it's a stark reminder that this violence does hide away in everyone and can erupt uncontrollably. Mistaken identity and redemption are other themes wonderfully explored, how much can and do you really know about a person, and can forgiveness be given on a tainted past.Finally dropping the rugged ranger look, which stuck from the Lord of the Ring films, Viggo Mortensen's mysterious Tom is perfectly played, with hints and herrings to the darker past that he may hold. Maria Bello is equally great as Edie, questioning herself with every violent act from Tom. Ed Harris's facially disfigured Carl is an amazing performance, helped by his deformed eye. Only in a cameo role, William Hurt steals the entire film, in a very twisted, funny role.Continuing his exploration of entwining sex and confronting violence, with a deep message of society and the violent nature of humanity, A History of Violence is David Croneberg's best film in a long time.",A History of Violence
167,mOVIemAN56,Viggo Mortensen delivers the best performance of his career,7,7 March 2007,"A History of Violence was a film I've been looking forward to for sometime. I just never could find the time to flick it on and watch it from start to finish. I didn't know much about it except that the guy who played Aragorn from Lord of the Rings was in it. After I went to IMDb and looked at the cast list and was able to see the cast assembled, I decided to make time to watch it.The film follows a man by the name of Tom Stall who lives a quiet little town in Indiana. He runs a diner, he's got a wife and two kids, he has his own life and he keeps to himself. He seem's to be living the American dream. That is until two men try to rob his diner and he defends himself and his customers. He becomes a local hero but not everything is great when something out of his past arises causing a tear in his quiet life.Viggo Mortensen is terrific as Tom Stall. He is quiet and a bit scary. He fits right in with a man trying to forget his past. Viggo Mortensen is the kind of person I'd like to see take on even bigger roles (if LOTR does not count) and become a mainstream actor, not just a guy who pops in and out of the spotlight. His acting ability is beyond great and he seems to fit right in with any role he takes. I have yet to see him in a role he doesn't work in.The supporting cast is just as good. William Hurt, Maria Bello, and Ed Harris all deliver top notch performances. William Hurt is the kind of person who plays right in with his character and in this case he IS Richie Cusack. Maria Bello is one of my favorite female actresses and did not disappoint me at all with her role as the wife, and Ed Harris simply puts the icing on this film with his role as the menacing and mysterious Fogarty.Now considering the film is called A History of Violence there is obviously going to be violence in the film. But what this film does what other films don't is the effect of violence on the characters around it. We see the result of violence on people's emotions and actions the whole while the film doe not glorify it. David Cronenberg is making an even bigger name for himself in the movie industry and with this hit he could soon become a real big name in Hollywood. I greatly enjoyed this film and will watch it again.3.5 out of 5 Stars",A History of Violence

I had heard from several different people that this was pretty much a crappy movie so I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed nearly all of it. It's a fun action/thriller with a very dramatic feel to and a lot of great scenes.I thought Viggo Mortenson was fantastic as well as William Hurt and Ed Harris. The story is very interesting and keeps you guessing until the credits begin to roll. The gore was also great as well as the action scenes and effects. This'll be one that I'll definitely be revisiting at some point.See this film if you love gory action films with good plots. I think you'll like it.,A History of Violence
169,Rockwell_Cronenberg,"A dissection of violence, family and man.",10,1 March 2012,"A History of Violence took David Cronenberg into a new and fascinating area of human drama. It is a film that explores many themes, from the impact of violence on a household to the dark nature that burns inside all of us, but at it's heart it is about a family torn apart by a lie. Cronenberg, as a filmmaker, was born in blood, but not in the rural America way that this film represents. He came from decades of the most shocking, grotesque physical and psychological horror that cinema was capable of, which made his exploration into the more realistic side of violence that much more intriguing. A History of Violence isn't loaded with the kind of insane imagery and special effects that left lasting impressions from his first few decades of film, but instead it takes it's place in the heart of America and doesn't remove itself from being firmly planted in a realistic setting.The film opens on a beautiful long-take of two mysterious men emerging from their hotel room, ready to check out and head upon their day. The opening is incredibly mundane, the two discussing the hot weather and their need for more water. As one of them comes out from the main office and the other goes back in to retrieve the water the moment takes on a shocking and sinister tone, as we see that these are men of extreme, immoral violence. Quickly we cut to the Stall family, where Tom Stall (played by Viggo Mortensen, in his first but not last collaboration with the director) awakens in the middle of the night to ease his daughter out of a bad dream. The introduction to the family is serene and very Little House on the Prairie, with it's sweetness and almost too-perfect dialogue.The next morning we open up on the town of Millbrook, Indiana, a quiet and peaceful place where everybody knows everybody else and you can walk to work if you want to. It's a lovely location, the kind of place that I would like to settle down one day, and Tom had made a wonderful life here with his children and wife Edie (Maria Bello). Of course this being a film, conflict arises when the two bad men stroll in and Tom is forced into an act of violence to protect himself and others at the local diner that he owns. This first act of violence is one of few in the film and it comes as a major shock to the viewer.In Cronenberg's previous films, the violence was always expected and sometimes outlandish, as appropriate for the science-fiction tinted stories that he was putting on display. Here he takes his same in-your-face approach to the violence, but the sereneness of daily life and the genuinely human tone of the piece makes it even more shocking than any of his previous works. Something as simple as a character shouting becomes something entirely out of place, entirely disruptive to the flow of daily life in this town.Tom's heroic act of violence sets off a chain of events that brings chaos on his home, with the menacing Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris) showing up afterwards and insisting that he knows Tom, but that his name is Joey Cusack and he is responsible for a lot of terrible things. This idea of the mild-mannered Tom Stall being a man of danger creates a rift in his home, constantly put into terror mode by the looming threat of what an outside force like Fogarty is capable of in this sweet little town. Cronenberg uses this paranoia and break of familial bonds to really dissect the typical American family, and in turn to dissect the archetype of the American man.I'm always a great admirer of when films are able to use sex as something more than just gratuitous thrills for the audience, and Cronenberg has always been one to bring much more importance to the act than most of his fellow directors in cinema do. A History of Violence features some of the most stunning use of the physical act I've ever seen, because not only does it use it as a moment of great importance for the characters themselves but it's one of the few films I've seen that is able to use sex as a means of significant character and thematic development. There are two sex scenes in the film and the contrast of them, the first being sweet and loving, the second being violent and brutal, speaks volumes to where the characters are at both points and how far they've come as a result.Stall must resort to one final act of violence, again being pushed into it by forces out of his control but completely by consequence of his own actions, and afterwards he cleanses himself in a lake in what is one of the most stunningly beautiful scenes I've experienced in film. Tom Stall is put through so much heartache throughout the film, torn apart by his own sins, and here at the end he has faced his demons and is now fully able to wash them away, baptizing himself in water after he is forced into a baptism by fire. It's a remarkably touching moment that brings this character study full circle, allowing him to return to the life he created for himself, but the film closes with a moment that lets the audience know that even if his family does accept him back nothing is going to be the same. You can't escape violence, not in this life.",A History of Violence
170,gary-444,"Quirky, Powerful and off Genre",7,26 December 2006,"I caught this movie unaware of who the Director and Cast were, let alone what the storyline was. I was rewarded with an above average movie which flirted with the Gangster genre, aided and abetted by ingredients from Western Revenge stories, and the unexplained, from sci-fi plots.Like many, I have enjoyed David Cronenberg's The Fly, The Dead Zone, and Dead Ringers, with an honourable mention to Crash. Viggo Mortensen excels as the lead Tom Stall, the ordinary man with extraordinary killing skills.Ed Harris is a savage counterpoint as Carl Foggerty, Stall's nemesis.The opening failed Coffee shop robbery starts off almost as an homage to Tarrantino's similar scene in ""Pulp Fiction"", but ends much more violently and unexpectedly. Cronenberg walks a difficult line throughout.He claims a distaste for violence and the glorification of it, but the raw brutality shown here is as graphic, and raw, as anything you will see anywhere.The sub text throughout is of the lurking power of violence which is almost expressed as an extra terrestrial power, a nod to his sci fi antecedants.Sex is similarly deployed in an ambivalent manner. One scene has Stall and his wife acting out a schoolkid cheerleader fantasy culminating in explicit, full on sex, the other key sex scene has Stall brutally forcing himself on her before she acquiesces, consents, and crucially, enjoys.Ultimately the film aspires, but fails to match, the flawed hero grandeur of say ""Carlito's Way"" ,which itself has Shakespearean Tragic pretensions.A cameo performance by William Hurt, gaining him bizarrely a ""best supporting actor"" nomination, is a distraction.The lack of local interest in the mounting feast of violence requires serious suspension of disbelief. But the integrity of performance from the entire ensemble is a joy.The 94 minute running time is tight and disciplined, and the otherworldly dimension of Stall, his wife, the luscious Maria Bello, and son in particular, provides nuances to a traditional core plot which lift this well out of the ordinary.",A History of Violence

It has a 90% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and is the highest rated film on Metacritic.If you are reading this, it is because you don't put all your faith in the professional critics. There have been too many times when a film has gotten great reviews and you paid your $10.50 and wasted 2 hours of your time. Apparently the requirements of a film for someone who has to pay for it is different than someone who gets paid to watch it.""A History of Violence"" is not a great film, or even a very good one. It is slightly below average. It has extremely slow pacing, which considering it is only about 90 minutes long, means they had very little story to tell.The professional critics would lead you to believe that this film is some sort of artistic statement about violence in our society. It's not. It is just a cheap gore fest. Richard Roeper says this film doesn't glorify the violence. I thought David Cronenberg went out of his way to make the violence as gory as possible. The way the sex and violence is depicted is totally gratuitous, but it is the only thing that stands out in this otherwise run of the mill film.The acting is some of the worst I have seen in a long time. Viggo Mortensen is real stiff and seems uncomfortable with his accent. Maria Bello matches his tone or lack thereof. Ed Harris is the only one who brings some life to what is otherwise a pretty dull film.The story has huge loopholes which I will not discuss because I don't want to give any of the story away. The ending did not have any sense of resolution. The directing is competent, but nothing special.There is a novel by Alice Hoffman called ""Blue Diary"" which has the same basic premise as this film. I highly recommend Hoffman's book over this film for anyone interested in this subject matter. It actually resolves the issues that both these stories introduce.There is also a film called ""Out of the Past"" which has a similar premise and it is much better than this one.If you enjoy graphic sex and violence in an otherwise slow film, you might like ""A History of Violence."" It is not a bad film but there is really nothing special about it other than the performance by Ed Harris. If you don't go to the theater very much, you can do better elsewhere. Don't believe the critics!",A History of Violence
172,come2whereimfrom,Cronenberg back on form.,7,2 October 2005,"A history of violence David Cronenberg returns with a bloody and brutal thriller which uses some of the themes he has explored before in a much more realistic way. Set in a quiet American town it tells the story of Tom stall a family man and small business owner who becomes a local hero after shooting two robbers who chose his coffee house as their next job. The only problem here is the unwanted attention his newfound fame brings him also brings some gangsters who are convinced he is not who he says he is and is in fact part of their criminal underworld. The film is paced slowly to start to lull you in to the lifestyle of the townsfolk, but quickly picks up pace after the first shots are fired. Cronenberg explores the idea of layers, not just in Tom's mind (is he Joey the gangster or mild mannered tom?) but also in society (violence is wrong of course, but when tom's son hits back at the bullies at school your secretly routing for him) so here the viewer is asked the questions of is it OK to be violent for the right reasons? To stand up to a bully? To protect your family? And how far is too far? The film is full of acts of violence from small to large and visceral. And much of the story hangs on these. Cronenberg and Viggo Mortensen (who much like Elijah wood in sin city, casts off his lord of the rings tag) keep you guessing about tom's real identity for at least half the film. It is hard to say more without giving too much away but it is a return to form for the director who's career has been a hit and miss affair, with challenging images alongside the challenging questions raised, a history of violence is a dark and bloody atmospheric thriller which will be hard to forget and all too easy to remember.",A History of Violence

As goes for the rest of the entire cast. Even small children are somber. So the lack of personality variation really makes it a grind.The first sex scene was very good cinema, however the staircase scene makes no sense at all. Someone's idea of violence and sex being linked which they aren't except in the case of a maniac - which is not the case with these characters.",A History of Violence

175,benoit-3,"I guess it's not ""gratuitous"" pornographic violence if they charge people money to see it...",1,15 March 2006,"In my opinion, this film glorifies violence and its moral is therefore evil. But I will grant that Cronenberg didn't get where he is today without learning how to push a few buttons along the way. Cronenberg knows how to show primal violence because that is his specialty, the thing that made him rich and famous. One of his manipulative devices, in this film, is hiring Viggo Mortensen as a kind of surrogate (and younger) Clint Eastwood in the principal role. You may have noticed that very few critics have singled out Mortensen's acting in this film for the very simple reason that he is only asked to go through the motions of the script (talk slowly, serve clients, kill people, comfort his son, rape his wife, what have you) with a totally blank expression or, occasionally, that of a sad puppy. That is so the audience can do all the work of projecting whatever feeling they want on his character, like they do on ""the man without a name"" in spaghetti westerns. But the fact that the actor was also the ""knight in shining armour"" (not to mention ""a man of mystery"") in ""Lord of the Rings"", that he shows all the right moves of ""Billy Jack"" and that the Howard Shore score is a retread of the ""Lord of Rings"" heroics sort of make you want to root for him, despite his troubled past and the ambiguous situations he finds himself in. The film would not have worked at all in the heroics department if the main character had been somewhat less than superhuman in his ability to dispatch the living. What we are admiring in him, first of all, is his ability to kill, with a gun or with his bare hands and with an apparently untroubled conscience. But if the hero had been anything a little less than a perfect killing machine, the film would have actually gained in humanity and realism and carried some kind of useful message. As it is, it is nothing more than the screen adaptation of comic book violence glorifying - once again - the ""hit man lifestyle"", with a little something extra in production values for the loafers to chew on while they are nibbling on their free hors-d'oeuvres at the Cannes film festival.Violence is going to be shown anyway in commercial films, whether I like it or not, because that is what people want to see more than anything right now. I of course prefer films that do not glorify violence in a direct or indirect way. Films that glorify violence in a direct way are called schlock. Films that glorify violence indirectly, like ""A History of Violence"", are hypocritical schlock. And that is the worst and most dangerous kind of violent film, in my humble opinion. The kind that wins awards and gains respectability...My personal opinion remains that Cronenberg has nothing really serious to say; he just likes blowing up people real good.Barring that possibility, the ""points"" made by the film are either one or several of the following: 1. Violence is sexy; it turns women on even as you rape them. 2. There is nothing wrong with violence that enough violence can't make right. Violence is a good way out of an intricate situation, like getting rid of a school bully or erasing one's past. (See: ""Mystic River"") 3. Violence is an excellent tool of father-son bonding and it tightens family relationships in the long run. 4. Violence is a worthwhile way of life, especially if you're on the winning side. 5. The medias glorify violence because it is entertaining. 6. Violence is always good for a few hearty laughs. 7. If you can't find a serious, self-respecting writer to go along with the points you're trying to make, you can always adapt a comic book, sorry a graphic novel, to the screen.Gee, thanks, Mr. Cronenberg! You're such a profound thinker! I don't know how America ever got along without your precious insights!",A History of Violence
176,ExpendableMan,"Good but not great, not quite the sum of its parts",5,15 May 2006,"Tom Stall is a family man living an unremarkable life in a small town in Georgia. He loves his wife and kids and runs a diner with his friends and everything in his life is quiet, decent and utterly content. Then one day a pair of killers walk into his restaurant and before he knows it, Tom has two corpses on his shop floor and is being heralded by the media as an American hero. There's just one problem: all of a sudden members of the Irish mob are turning up on his doorstep and they're very keen to know exactly why Tom is so proficient when it comes to killing people...From this premise, director David Cronenberg sets about making A History of Violence one of his most intriguing films. There is none of the blood spattered body mutations of his earlier work in horror and instead the film is quieter and very slow paced, a tactic which makes the outbursts of brutality all the more shocking. Unfortunately though it isn't quite the film it promises to be, the character study remaining relatively underwritten and filled out instead with a horrifically violent ending that feels more tacked on than essential.On the plus side though, what does work is Cronenberg's dissection of the American dream. Once the introduction for the killers is over and done with, the next fifteen to twenty minutes are spent establishing just how perfect Tom's life is. That his family are a unit is rammed home with the first shot of them all rescuing his young daughter from her night terrors and the archetypal breakfast they share nails it even further with barely a hint of subtlety. Coupled with the small town idealism of quaint little diners, friendly vicars and lemon meringue pie, no expense is spared in crafting this heavenly little world even if the sex scene where Tom and his wife sixty nine one another seems a tad unnecessary.Once Ed Harris and his goon squad arrive however we are presented with the dark underbelly to this unrelenting slice of Americana. Convinced that Tom is really an ex gangster named Joey Cusack, the mob harass Tom at work and home and it's not long before the body count rises, the family man rising from his humble status to defend his loved ones and his property. The sight of Tom stood outside his home with a shotgun in one hand and his wife stood behind him, daring the mob to come closer shows us what A History Of Violence really is; a modern day Western, the common man standing up to the forces of darkness.But is it? After all the gangsters do have a point; Tom is awfully good at killing. He couldn't actually be the deranged murderer they think he is could he? Well anyone who's read the title of the movie will know and therein lies the twist in the tale: Americana is built on lies, deceit and bloodshed.The finished product therefore is a movie of two halves. As a modern day Western it is a fine example and it is easy to cheer on Tom as the downtrodden underdog even if he has better odds than he first appears. As a character study of the American family unit under stress from a series of traumatic events however it fails, Cronenberg relying on shots of the hero sleeping on a sofa, an uncomfortable sex scene and some utterly pointless full frontal nudity to make his point. Nevertheless, it is an enjoyable film if approached in the right frame of mind and though not perfect, still worth a minimum of at least two viewings to take everything in.",A History of Violence
177,MovieCriticMarvelfan,Cronenberg does it again.,6,9 October 2005,"David Cronenberg one of my favorite horror directors of all time has struck gold once again, this time showing that he can a lot more than sci-fi and horror. This time he chooses to make a violent, but powerful acted and character driven movie called ""A History of Violence"". ""A History of Violence"" has a very familiar storyline that some ignorant audience members might use an excuse to not see the movie, but boy would they be missing out on a great movie!!!! Yes the story is nothing new in today's time, a guy living the normal life has a past that he doesn't want to reveal and has been hiding. Then during one instance, in a life or death situation, his identity is revealed. The story then has Viggo Mortensen (in perhaps his best role since the Lord of the Ring movies) as Tom Stall who is the owner of a small restaurant/coffee shop. He and his wife both work side by side. He has two great kids, one daughter and older son. He has everything a guy could want then one day, a group of lowlifes try to rape an employee and thus he springs to action. Like a hired killer, Tom disposes of these trash quite easily. He is labeled in the media as hero, and while Tom enjoys this and thinks none of it, an old friend is watching. Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris, who is equally great in this movie) comes looking for Tom. His wife Edie Stahl and Tom don't recognize him. Carl eventually tells us all about Tom's rather elusive history. It seems that the guys Tom wasted are aligned to the mafia, and that Carl is their ""main"" guy. Carl thinks Tom is actually some guy named Joey from his crew. Of course Tom doesn't recall him or so we think. Not going to spoil the end for you people but what I can say is that ""A History of Violence"" much like ""The Constant Gardener"" is another memorable film from 2005 A very good film and for Cronenberg, man this is quite an accomplishment. Most ignorant critics will say wow what a breakthrough!!!! But really there are some Cronenberg traits in this movie like his other ones. For one the characters are pretty darn likable, the characters are real and gritty, there are some violent imagery that pushes the film to present us very discussionable moral themes at the end, and the best part is that is it very well acted. This is a great Cronenberg flick, it shows to those snobby critics that he can do a lot more than horror, but I've always known that every one of Crony's film has good drama, and character development. See this movie now!!!",A History of Violence
178,luke-a-mcgowan,"Very slow burn, with a huge lack of pay off",4,16 June 2015,"Sometimes things work in films, and sometimes they don't. Spoiler heavy review follows. Much like the much derided (and deservingly so) The Tourist, sometimes a twist can only possibly go one way because the film hasn't left itself room to move. Ironically and very disappointingly, the exact same twist happens in A History of Violence - turns out the meek hero is actually the guy we've been looking for the whole time. In The Tourist, it was explained away by plastic surgery. Even that was good next to the laughably bad excuse I was given in History of Violence - ""I took him out to the desert and killed him"". What, you killed your identity? Why'd you have to go out to the desert? Do you actually have split personalities? Why do you change voices? Are you like a sleeper agent who can leap back and forth between certain forms when threatened? None of this was explained in History of Violence.I put this movie on expecting the film to follow its premise - a mild mannered hero is mistaken for a long time mob acquaintance and must deal with those repercussions out of his depth. I'm still waiting to see that movie. Beyond the film's stupid plot, there's actually quite a bit of good stuff in here. Cronenberg's knack for gratuitous violence and sex makes dull points of the film far more memorable than they would otherwise have been. The upsetting violence really does great things for creating an atmosphere of dread. Ed Harris is a highlight, wearing that hideous eye makeup like a crown and owning it completely. Maria Bello is a great actress, and Ashton Holmes isn't too bad either. Not a lot goes into exploring who they are - probably because it'll create too many questions when the stupid twist arises. Howard Shore's score is very reminiscent of Lord of the Rings, which is amusing when Mortensen is on screen. The film's highlight is William Hurt, who in 10 minutes is the most memorable and exciting part of the film. When Viggo flips out and starts wasting his henchmen, Hurt's look of disgust and incredulity is absolutely priceless. The best scene in the film is when Viggo slams the door on him, he pull his keys out and tries to remember how to get back in. He's deliciously malevolent but surprisingly hilarious.You can easily skip the first 20 minutes of the film, especially considering that its just a red herring to try and convince you that he really is just a normal (read boring) guy with a normal life. Also his son is a wuss apparently. That's not important. The only other thing you'll miss is a bit of cringeworthy dialogue (from Viggo, Bello and little Heidi Hayes, who unfortunately cannot act) and a lot of set up. Ironically that only leaves you with just over an hour of film left, but it won't feel like it - this is probably the slowest burning 90 minute film I've ever seen.",A History of Violence
179,PipAndSqueak,In the long shadow of 'Unforgiven',8,2 October 2005,"Cronenberg has much to learn about technique so that his 'clever' shots and angles don't interfere with the tale he his telling. In this sense he has much to learn from Eastwood whose Unforgiven is a clear predecessor. Occasional wooden acting and unnecessarily craned camera work nevertheless fails to spoil this immensely watchable story. There is blood and gore - just be amazed by the make-up artist's skill! It's a believable story, in the main well cast. William Hurt however does come across like a Mark Gatiss clone (League of Gentlemen) and doesn't quite convince as the malevolent brother. Here we have a history of one of humanity's flaws - no answers, and raising many questions. A definite must see for our times.",A History of Violence
180,Pookyiscute,Excellent,10,29 April 2006,"Why this was overlooked for an Oscar nomination this past year, is beyond me. It was well-written, well-directed, and most of all well-acted.Viggo Mortensen plays a small town, Indianian, who owns the local diner. With his son and daughter and beautiful wife at home, one evening, two criminal men come into his diner. After refusing to leave, because they're closed, the two men become violent and threaten to kill the waitress, if Mortensen doesn't give them all the money from the till. Mortensen, swiftly and efficiently kills both men, and becomes the town hero. After gaining wide coverage of his heroism, the following week three men in suites come to visit him. They claim that he knows them from his past, but Mortensen denies the accusation.The movie continues on this path until we find out the truth of what the man who we've come to genuinely like, has hidden from us.If you're someone who gets offended easily by sex scenes or violence, I would definitely not recommend this film. It's full of both, each equally offensive. There are two very racy sex scenes,some nudity, and there is more blood and violence than in most violent movies.Viggo Mortensen was excellent, and I would say the same for Maria Bello. Ed Harris and William Hurt however, stand out more than anyone else in this picture, in my opinion. They both give outstanding performances, and I'm a bit surprised that neither one of them received any recognition for their work.All in all it's a terrific film, and I will definitely be seeing it again in the near future.",A History of Violence
181,Quebec_Dragon,Thought-provoking quality drama,7,24 June 2009,"Let's start by writing this is a film I have difficulty evaluating. You notice the great technical qualities but emotionally it leaves you conflicted. Which, considering this is a Cronenberg film, might just be what was intended. I've seen most of his films and ""A history of violence"" is probably the least weird and most ""commercial"" (a term used by the director himself). It's a psychological drama with of course certain sequences of violence. It would not qualify as an action flick because the fight scenes are quite quick (less than a minute mostly), realistic, harsh and not glamorized. They're rather shocking but somehow exhilarating (like an adrenaline rush) but linger just a bit to show the results and make you feel uncomfortable. In the end, it does make you think about violence, if it's something ingrained, how it affects people, if it can sometimes be justified and if it can be overcome.Let's not forget a very interesting mystery aspect regarding the past of the main character played solidly and subtly by Viggo Mortensen. All the actors were quite convincing in their parts, the wife being suitably loving and tormented, the main gangsters being suitably menacing. They felt like real characters and I particularly liked the interactions between the wife and husband. Cronenberg is obviously a professional at his craft and shows it once again. It's cinema d'auteur as we would say in french but it's not boring or overtly intellectual. So if you're a Cronenberg fan, this is obviously a must-buy but expect it to be relatively more ""tame"" than his previous efforts. If you like smart character driven psychological dramas with a hint of mystery, it's a must see but I'm conflicted as to how re-watchable it is, making a purchase recommendation an uncertain thing. Fans of the Cohen brothers dramas/thrillers would probably like it also.Rating: 7.5 out of 10",A History of Violence

Based on the plot for 'The Fastest Gun in the West' whereby someone who is an ace killer is trying to hide in obscurity, but reveals his hand by necessity, the ramifications of stepping back into the limelight, eg gangsterism, are played out very starkly and simply - revenge and violence. Stripped fairly bare (literally as well as metaphorically) it engages the emotions and interest, and manages to slide by the reasons as to why the hero dropped out of sight - well done, the Director! The acting is like a one note charade - guess the answer/outcome from such appalling evil characters? But does not suffer from the pomposity and operatic pretentiousness of Scorsese and Coppola's overblown (and vastly overpraised) mafia movies. Indeed this film would have been a western 40/50 years ago, but the heart of the US history and memory of origins has shifted - literally and cinematically? - from the western frontier to the urban jungle.

Is he Tom Stall, aw shucks diner owner or is he super-hit-man Joey Cusack from Philly on the run from the mob? And if he is, how does he handle his family and friends finding out and the mob which is rightly or wrongly after him?Along the way to answering these questions there is plenty of action and bloodshed. It was interesting reading on IMDb about the director's aversion to gratuitous violence because there is so much of it. Not just killing, but graphic shots of those who have just had their jaws shot off, nose shot off, top of their head shot off...I could have lived without that. Plus some gratuitous nudity and sex scenes thrown in to boot (did I mention the Sopranos?)....I only watched this movie to see Viggo Mortensen in a non-Aragorn role and it was bizarre. His face looks downright strange without the whiskers and his body, though buff, has none of the heroic proportions of his alter-ego. At one point I found myself laughing and calling for him to pull out his sword because the against-all-odds killing (a la Aragorn or Die Hard) got pretty predictable after a while.If you liked the Sopranos you should love this movie.

184,The_Core,Great film...,8,17 April 2006,"It's evident to me from reading some of the other reviews that a lot of folks just don't 'get' David Cronenberg. I can see why in some ways, but I'm puzzled at the one-star reviews. If nothing else, I found this film highly entertaining and so fast paced it seemed to end as soon as it started (in fact, I wish more time was spent in character development... a three hour movie would have been better.I don't really agree with Cronenberg's ""Darwinistic"" view of violence (which is for the most part no longer necessary in today's society, not to mention doubtful as a trait passed down in families) but I sure do appreciate a director putting his ideas down in film so effectively. Apparently the psychological meaning of the second sex scene escaped a lot of people as well, which I find to be strange.Anyway, this is certainly a movie worth owning on DVD... particularly if you're familiar with some of Cronenberg's earlier films.

Not only long lost, but long sought after, as Ed takes off his glasses and shows us what Tom (called Jerry by Harris) did to him many whacks ago! Tom tries to play dumb for as long as he can, but when Ed threatens his family - Yup, you guessed it, off come the glasses again and mayhem ensues.Problem is, that after all of these made guys are whacked openly, no FBI shows up.

186,tccandler,So close and yet so far...,7,11 January 2006,"Picture, for a moment, the Venus de Milo with a clown nose and a funny hat. In a nutshell, that is David Cronenberg's ""A History of Violence""... A brilliant work of art with a few of the most ridiculously embarrassing and utterly unnecessary accessories in recent memory.There you have it... Scattered throughout a taut and mesmerizingly tense screenplay are some scenes that had my jaw dropped, partly through amazement that they were included and partly because I found myself laughing at unintended moments.Viggo Mortensen plays Tom, a small town family man who becomes a local hero when he thwarts a robbery and possible rape in his own restaurant. In doing so, he kills the two criminals and the media picks up on the story.Within days of his new-found celebrity, he is paid a visit by some Philadelphia mobsters, led by a scar-faced Ed Harris in a chilling performance, who are convinced that he is a man named Joey Cusack.I cannot detail the plot without giving away major plot points that are best left to a virgin viewing experience, but needless to say, Tom and his family are hounded by the danger of this mafia threat and Tom is forced to take action.I was reminded of the 1998 masterpiece, ""A Simple Plan"" in terms of tension, style, the small town intimacy & the mounting escalation of dramatic events. It was this part of the story that was truly riveting and masterfully written.However, there are about a dozen scenes of such cringe-worthy corniness that I found myself questioning the brilliance of the rest of the film. Some of the scenes were the worst in ANY film I saw in 2005. All but one of them involve Tom's children. The adults in this film, Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello, Ed Harris and William Hurt, all give fine performances worth of award consideration. But the kids in this film... OH... MY... GOD!!! I can honestly say that I haven't seen such wooden acting outside of a Star Wars movie. Actually the acting is Star Wars puts these kids to shame. The worst of these scenes involve a high-school bully's attempts to push around the son. Every time we break for this sub-plot, viewer's eyes will be rolling.The family moments are so forced and awkward that is almost destroys the credibility built up in the rest of the screen-time. There is also one astonishing poorly timed sex scene on the stairs (you'll know it when you see it) that may have been the most miscalculated moment of the decade. It belongs in a daytime soap opera.I am not sure that I have ever been so conflicted in watching over three thousand films. Most of this film deserves an A... Parts of this film are truly not worthy of a Porky's sequel.However, brush aside these 10-12 scenes, about 20 minutes worth of useless plot, and you have one of the best films of the year. How can a film alternately be this good and this bad? I am giving the film a recommendation, but I cannot imagine that you won't notice the same flaws. Some may be more forgiving than I, as is evident from the critical acclaim it is receiving. But the flaws are there... you cannot convince me that you didn't at least recognize their presence.Cronenberg's ""A History of Violence"" is a concerto by Mozart interrupted on occasion by the theme to Benny Hill. It is so close to greatness that it feels like a real shame to have let it go for some unnecessary scenes.",A History of Violence
187,basrutten,Nothing special whatsoever,4,31 October 2006,"I had quite high hopes for this movie, but they were not satisfied at all. Presented in the media as something special, ""A History of Violence"" is anything but.The premise behind this movie is fairly simple, and I'm not going to bore you by repeating it here. It could have made for a decent thriller, but it overplays its hand badly by trying to be a serious drama.The problem is that for a serious drama, both the script and acting are simple way too shoddy. Just about every character is an enormous cliché or even a caricature, the dialog is about as far removed from sharp as is humanely possible, and most of the actors make a very uninspired impression. Some of the acting (William Hurt and the girl child) is atrocious to watch, Viggo Mortensen does little but stare, and only Ed Harris is halfway decent.As a thriller, it doesn't really work either. It's slowly paced, it's full of gratuitous sex and the story is enormously predictable.In the end, I was bored and frustrated by this movie. Bored for all the obvious reasons, and frustrated because this cast should have been able to do much better, and because an otherwise original and interesting director has delivered a movie that claims to be really special is anything but.",A History of Violence

189,Nemesis42,A study of the darkness within us all.,10,8 November 2020,Out of Cronenberg's recent works this is the best. A study of karma in part. What is most interesting is how his 'innocent' family deals with the events and revelations. This aspect provides a rotational pivot point and counter balance to the violent side of the world in that film. The pressure of the incessant nasty and dark components of the world vs the peace and harmony many of us desire.This tension between the two binaries also illustrates that we accept the undeniable darkness within us as individuals. This concept for individuals is pushed constantly in the film. Even in the final scene where the most 'innocent' character accepts the violence into the family.Brilliant work by the team.,A History of Violence

It started of well and maintained this presence of something is about to happen but it really never took off. The plot also kind of gets really lame and by this time I has snoozed off twice and had to concentrate on the screen something that I have never really had to do but probably will let you know how bored I got . However some action sequences were entertaining no matter how out-landish they looked . Ed Harris just about was the only actor worth watching despite the low level of screen time he was given .

191,alfiefamily,Masterful and Disturbing,9,1 January 2007,"""A History of Violence"" reminds me of the old line about watching a car wreck. You don't want to watch, but you can't turn away from looking at it. This is a movie that will obviously have many people cringing. Not just at the body count, but because they may realize that everyone is capable of some type of brutality or violence. I think that was director David Croenenberg's main theme with this film. To show people that at any given moment, when provoked, they are capable of great violence. Not just the hit man, or the battering husband, but the child when pushed to the edge by a bully. The wife who feels betrayed by her husband and acts out her violence in a sexual manner. Croenenberg wants us to see that no matter how we each try to suppress it, or want to deny that it's possible, at some point we may all react to our most basic animal instinct. The instinct to survive.The cast here is spectacular. Viggo Mortensen is Tom Stall, a man who is trying to hide his past. Maria Bello is his loving, supportive wife. Ed Harris is a man who reminds Tom of his past, and expects him to make amends. And William Hurt, in only one scene, steals the film as ""Tom's"" brother Richie. All of the performances are perfect, but Hurt is especially delicious as he tries to explain how upset he was when his mother caught him trying to strangle Tom as a baby.One of the other things that I loved about this movie, was the fact that the director did not try to drag out the movie and tack on one surprise fake ending after another. Too often directors will add too many twists and turns to their films thinking that it makes the film more interesting. It doesn't. Croenenberg trusts the story to end with a question mark. I won't divulge the ending, other than to say that it will make the viewer reflect on their own thoughts of violence.On the one hand, I can't wait to see it again. On the other hand, I'm not so sure that I could possibly watch it again.9 out of 10",A History of Violence
192,JoshtheGiant,Brilliant,9,19 March 2006,"David Cronenberg is one of those directors that no one has heard of, and that half the people that have heard of truly hate. He has a habit of making extremely gory and disturbing films that often are also classics. His films are terribly hard to watch. They often center around the worst things that can happen to the human body. In one of his earlier films called Videodrome James Woods had the pleaser of pulling a video cassette out of his own entrails. A History of Violence is while far from his goriest, most disturbing, or best it is none the less very gory, disturbing, and good. The plot is tight. It would have worked for a short film and in the hands of any other director would have failed. Cronenberg on the other hand has experience with this kind of story. Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello, Ashton Holmes, and Ed Harris are all amazing and Oscar worthy but it is William Hurt in a fairly small yet hilarious performance in the end of the film that is the standout. He is just brilliant. Cronenberg is a great director and although he has been better he still is amazing here. He knows his story and his characters so well that they seem more than a little real for us, and for some of them that is a very scary thing. A History of Violence is one of the years best films, but is not for everybody.",A History of Violence
193,roland-104,Cronenberg trips over tired clichés on violence in the U.S. - disappointing,5,4 November 2005,"David Cronenberg, surprisingly, delivers damaged goods in this dull, crudely constructed story of a former mob hit-man turned solid citizen turned killer once again because of circumstances. Small town coffee shop owner Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) has lived nearly half his life peaceably with his wife Edie (Maria Bello), an attorney. They have a teen son and young daughter.But Tom is not who he appears to be. When he adroitly overcomes and kills two itinerant crooks, this brings Tom his 15 minutes of national fame on TV, and also brings some serious mobsters to town to visit him. Seems they have recognized Stall as Joey Cusack, a nasty hit-man in his day, who disappeared from Philly years ago. Tom must once again kill or be killed by these heavies, and it doesn't stop there.The problem here is not the premise. People by the tens of thousands change their identities every year. Rather it is the regrettable mix of a ho-hum screenplay, adapted from a graphic novel, and the tepid acting of the central characters. Mortensen (Aragron in the ""Lord of the Rings"" series, among his 40+ film roles) is all but lifeless here and is unable to carry the film. Bello's character provides some dash in rough sex scenes with Tom but otherwise offers little to the proceedings. The screenplay does her no favors when it requires her to withdraw loyalty from Tom too quickly in favor of pouts and profanity. The son's sudden turn from milquetoast to dangerous fighter is not credible.The kindest thing to be said for Cronenberg here is that this was not his project: he was a hired gun, i.e., brought in by the producers to direct. Perhaps he was tempted by the multimillion dollar budget, the largest chunk of change he has ever had to work with for a movie. The only reasons to see this film are Ed Harris and William Hurt as mob chieftains: they seem to be thoroughly enjoying themselves. The moral lesson hamhandedly meted out here is, well, what? Once a crook, always a crook? Hmmmm. Perhaps it's that old staple film saw: that you can't shake off your wayward past. Mercifully, you can shake off this disappointing movie. It only takes a few minutes. My rating: 5/10 (C) (Seen on 10/16/05). If you'd like to read more of my reviews, send me a message for directions to my websites.",A History of Violence
194,TheMovieMark,One of 2005's Biggest Disappointments,5,30 September 2005,"Are you in the mood for a fast-paced, action-packed thriller? Well, so was I. Unfortunately, you won't find it here. However, if you were extremely interested in A History of Violence after watching the trailer and you're in the mood to be disappointed, then by all means, knock yourself out with this one! I simply don't understand why everybody is praising this one to the high heavens. I was looking forward to it, and I hate to say that it's simply the biggest disappointment of the year. It starts off on a promising note when Viggo takes care of the bad guys who enter his diner. For a few brief moments it looks like it's trying to be a well-crafted mystery/thriller. But once it starts inducing unintentional laughter thanks to scenes that look like they came out of a bad after school special or a soft core made-for-late-night-Cinemax film we realize that this is just a complete mess.The sex scenes? Gratuitous and completely out of place. I have to believe that Cronenberg's desired reaction from the audience was NOT chuckling and shouts of, ""Someone fast forward please!"" And the acting of the secondary characters? Laughable. What was up with the high school bully? This Randy Travis/Patrick Swayze hybrid sashays onto the screen sportin' a nice 80s mullet and a flipped up jacket collar looking like he just tried out for a rejected pilot called Son of Fonzi.Viggo's son isn't much better, spitting out completely ridiculous lines like, ""Hey dad, they want to interview you because of what you just did!"" Thank you, Captain Obvious. The lion's share of the bad dialogue goes to this cue card reader, and I sure wish I could expose more of it to you. Unfortunately, doing so would reveal too many spoilers, and I refuse to do that no matter how much of a letdown the movie is.I dare you to try to avoid erupting into laughter when William Hurt's mob character appears and plays the cliché card so close to the vest that you're left waiting for him to say something like, ""Youse wants I should trows youse a beatin'?"" Were these supposed to be caricatures? The movie takes itself way too seriously for me to believe that's the case.I started to lose all hope once the mystery that was crafted at the beginning produced an unfortunately predictable payoff, but I thought there was a chance we'd be served a nice big slice of knockout ending. Thought wrong. Viggo's fighting at the end is pretty cool, but it only occupied maybe 5 minutes of screen time. So what do we get rather than a slam dunk finale? Well, the closing scene of the movie might as well be called ""The History of Silence"" because the audience is forced to sit there and watch Viggo Mortensen and Maria Bello just stare at each other for what feels like about half an hour. I'm sure plenty of turtleneck-wearing movie critics will find some sort of hidden meaning in their glares, but had I been at home I would've been trying to find the remote so I could make use of the friendly fast forward button.",A History of Violence
195,Ziya90,"It is not deep or thought provoking as critics and Cronenberg fans think, but it is definitely an exploitation of violence and sex",2,20 March 2016,"I admire the director Cronenberg and like most of his works, but A History of Violence is not about violence, it is exploitation of violence in sick, disgusting manner. There is something wrong with the way of handling violence and sex of this film. Even the sex scenes between the couple is somehow different, crude and nasty. In real life, it is OK maybe, but the question is what is the point? If it is to show us the passion between them, there are lots of ways to do that. I think this movie is an example of violence porn. The movie starts out well with a powerful opening scene, good atmosphere like a modern Western, amazing villains, but then it turns into a nasty B movie in the end. I love B movies from 90s and 80s especially, but it doesn't fit here. The cinematography here is very well done, Ed Harris was the real star of the movie for me. However, our anti hero and his origin story don't work because of all those sickness and sadism and it is like the movie glorifies his nasty actions and probably want us to accept his acts and root for him. The story with memory loss or secret identity themes make no sense here. Sorry, but this movie is not Total Recall which is a real masterpiece. The man who appears in the final act doesn't add anything to the story in spite of that great actor who was wasted here. The final act that reminds you a bad B movie is another violence porn, softer this time. Our anti hero is not another manly man unfortunately. His violent actions cause some sick and sadistic moments, so what would you do if your anti hero is a hateful man? I was with Ed Harris's character though. By the way, I disagree with the idea that A History of Violence is a deep or thought provoking film. This film is no Shakespeare, it is like a violent action movie for video with some great actors and good cinematography. I enjoyed some parts, but overall I was disgusted. One final word, I think Eastern Promises is a better film.",A History of Violence
196,RockPortReview,Viggo Motensen's History of great films,8,3 April 2012,"Famed Canadian director David Cronenberg's last three movies have one thing in common they all feature ""Lord of the Rings"" star Viggo Mortensen. These movies are ""A History of Violence (2005)"", ""Eastern Promises (2007)"", and ""A Dangerous Method (2011)"". Their collaborations have made Cronenberg's films more widely accessible to mainstream audiences, while also bringing strong critical praise. Each of these films will be reviewed in the coming weeks in the Rockport Review. I have also previously reviewed a number of Cronenberg's earlier films such as ""Rabid"", ""Scanners"", ""Dead Ringers"", and ""The Fly"".""A History of Violence"" is based on the graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke. Screenwriter Josh Olson was nominated for an Academy Award for his job in adapting it for the screen. This is the story of a small town man named Tom Stall (Mortensen) who owns the local diner. One night he skillfully dispatches a couple of thugs who try to rob the place. He then becomes an overnight media sensation while also inadvertently bringing his dark and buried past to the surface. Tom lives the classic American small town life, he is married to Edie, played by Maria Bello. Together they have a teenage son and a younger daughter. Tom and Edie have a strong loving relationship, but when a group of tough guys from Philly come to town, they not only threaten Tom's marriage but his life.Ed Harris plays Carl Fogarty a made man from the Philly mob who visit's Tom's diner. He has a nasty scar where his left eye use to be and is quite intense and menacing. He calls Tom by his supposed former name ""Joey, Joey Cusack"". With Edie at his side Tom is confounded and insists he has the wrong guy. Fogarty talks to him like they are old friend and his words have a truthful intensity to them. Local Sheriff and friend Sam looks into Fogarty's background and confirms everything Tom suspected. These are dangerous and violent people. When Fogarty stalks Tom's wife and daughter at the local mall, and tells of her husbands shady past, Edie starts to freak out.Uneasy times consume the Stall family; who is their husband and father anyway? Are Fogarty's accusations true? Things come to a head and an intense confrontation in the Stalls front yard ensues. Tom has no choice but to protect his family at all costs, but his son Jack seams to be following in his fathers violent footsteps. Tom realizes he needs to put ""Joey Cusack"" to sleep for good so he goes to visit his high ranking mob brother Ritchie at his Suburban Philadelphia mansion. Ritchie Cusack is played by William Hurt who was surprisingly nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his 10 minutes of screen time. Tom/Joey and Ritchie have little brotherly love for one another as they confront each other one last time.This movie is skillfully acted and well put together. Viggo Mortensen is known for really inhabiting the characters he portrays and doesn't disappoint here. David Cronenberg got his start in horror films and has been known for his kind of bizarre bodily violence, something that is readily apparent in a number of scenes in ""History"".

David Cronemburg proves yet again he can master a superb cast as well as the story, and it clearly shows here. A History of Violence is a real piece of Hollywood perfection that doesn't get boring or cheesy like past Hollywood films. Take for instance Batman Forever or the more recent Meet Dave. these films totally lack all the substances and layers of a good film. Violence on the other hand explores brutal realism with a pitch perfect story.On its surface it bears an intriguing resemblance to Straw Dogs. The fact that a peaceful man living in a small town, is forced upon to commit graphic acts of violence. Cronemburg also at the same time impacts the audience with the fact that to Tom Stall/ Joey Cusack that violence is the only way foreword.

Regardless of my ultimate feelings about the film, I was never bored.The hero's initial success in vanquishing the murderers was believable (with some allowances made) in the context of real-life possibilities. However, the repeated Ramboesque victories over the bad guys took this past the plane of human experience into the realm of the graphic novel. The son's realistic and believable experiences in school bullying were dealt with by a totally unrealistic (though gratifying) response, suggesting that super-human powers are genetic.I don't complain at all about believability (though I never believed William Hurt). The questions raised by this film were wonderful, such as the son's dilemma: do I hate dad because he is an underworld kingpin who concealed his origins, when I have benefited by the genetic transfer of his power to deal with my enemies? A fascinating film which I cannot easily forget.This would be an entertaining as well as thought-provoking film, which I'd recommend for rental and viewing.",A History of Violence

Great, but surely not Cronenberg's best work.

200,smellthecult-com-1,Stylish thriller,8,22 September 2009,"Cronenberg's Mafia effort is a stylish, if not entirely convincing affair. Viggo Mortensen, the man with a jaw so square you could butter it up and stick it under the grill with some grated cheese plays Tom, an everyday sort; kind, unassuming, a good family man. One night, as he is about to close his diner a couple of Mafia sorts enter and insist that he serve them. He attempts to comply, clearly hoping that he can co-operate and see them on their way, when events escalate as the hoodlums threaten to kill a member of his staff. Without pause for thought, he bursts into action, killing both of the mobsters, seemingly surprising himself as much as the bad guys. Shortly after, a Mafiosa lynch pin from Philadelphia pays him a visit and insists that he is not actually called Tom but Joey and that the scar on the Wiseguy's face is as a result of a barbed wire attack by the aforementioned Joe. And he's seeking retribution. Within hours, the life of the previously sedate and settled Tom is spiralling out of control as a battle of identity ensues. Whilst not Croneneberg's best effort, this is nevertheless engaging, tense fare with an intriguing premise and riveting performances all round, particularly from Viggo 'Aragorn' Mortensen, a man with depths of ability I was previously unaware of. It's a brief movie too, something I tend to approve of, coming in just over the hour and a half mark, meaning that little time is wasted on unnecessaries, trimmed right down to the bone for maximum impact. The 2 docked marks are as a result of the latter scenes, involving the Mafia, lacking real credibility. That aside, this is a confident, understated, intelligent thriller that should appeal to most with a brain cell to rub together.

201,moutonbear25,History Repeating,9,5 November 2005,"A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE Written by Josh Olson Directed by David CronenbergTo decipher and comprehend the nature of anything in the present, one must have a solid understanding of the past history leading up to the present moment. With ""A History of Violence,"" Canadian filmmaker, David Cronenberg explores whether one man can escape a violent past to maintain a simple yet meaningful present while ultimately avoiding history repeating itself through future family generations.Viggo Mortensen plays Tom Stall, the owner of a local diner in a small town. His life is simple and fulfilling. He starts each day around the dinner table with his beautiful wife, Edie (Maria Bello), infant daughter (Heidi Hayes) and mild-mannered teenage son, Jack (Ashton Holmes). The stall family is functional, happy, balanced. It is both comforting and reassuring to see such a pleasant family where everything isn't perfect but the effort is being made and the commitment is strong. Everyone does their part, from Jack feeding the dog to Tom sitting up with his daughter after a nightmare to Edie dressing up like a cheerleader to roleplay with her husband. This family seems aware of how fortunate they are to have each other and to live in the town of Millbrook, where people stop to say hello on the street as they walk past, where people aren't faceless. Cronenberg takes his time with this setup, allowing us to become drawn in to this comfortable place. Of course, we have the knowledge that something bad is on its way from before the film started which builds tension as we wait. It also makes the fall so much further as there is much at stake for the Stall's. On one insignificant day, Tom fights back with precision and intensity against two men that hold up his diner and threaten his patrons. Tom's act of extreme bravery garners him national media attention and subsequently leads some gentlemen, of the disturbing and frightening nature, to the town of Millbrook and his diner counter. Led by Carl Fogerty (Ed Harris), these men accuse Tom of being someone he claims not to be which in turn forces him to face who he used to be, who he has become and how to integrate both of these sides of himself.Tom's use of violence is shown as a means to defend one's self as well as to intimidate at times. This dichotomy debates whether violence is the only solution to violence. In the case of the diner incident, there is a threat of pain and death, forcing desperation and preservation to become the controlling factor. There is no question that Tom did the right thing by protecting himself and his patrons but the nature and reality of the violence is still difficult to stomach for those who witnessed it. To further show a pattern of history and legacy being passed on, Jack takes from his father's example, consequently blurring the lines when he fights back against a bully in school who accuses him of weakness. Violent tendencies in youth are more primal as they supposedly don't know any better or don't have a complete understanding of their emotions forcing them to act out instinctively. To have violence as a natural reaction, as in the case of the unsubstantiated bullying, confirms it as a means to mask a greater fear. To have Jack fight back asserts his power and self-worth but could easily lead to an unhealthy reliance. Like his father, Jack could end up having to walk away from a life where violence is a normal part of that life. But like his father, will he ever truly be able to leave it? Violence can show up anywhere and creep back in at any time.""A History of Violence"" is haunting and disturbing. It is a quiet film that moves at the pace one would expect in a town like Millbrook and when the violence unravels itself on screen, it is quick and sudden. It is cold, senseless and gory and it will both shock and jar you. The unsettling carnage lingers in silence and so will you.",A History of Violence
202,screenwriter-14,Violence Begets Violence...,8,23 September 2005,"From the first frame of THE HISTORY OF VIOLENCE as the credits roll, David Cronenberg sets up the audience for the violence that follows, and masterfully moves the film forward as the young daughter wakes up to a bad dream with loud screams. Brilliant! Then he introduces us to the characters all in one scene and the story moves forward with what we think is just a happy American family. What a surprise is in store...Viggo Mortenson is tremendous as Tom Stall, and gives a subtle and powerful performance, as does Maria Bello. Their chemistry on the screen and their sex scenes play into the theme of violence as the film progresses. And the final scene of the family at the dinner table with no words said, is one to remember.THE HISTORY OF VIOLENCE is well written, with tremendous character development and direction from Cronenberg, and a superb cast. William Hurt reminds me of the 'Godfather' in his scenes with Viggo Mortenson, and like 'The Godfather', delivers a performance that is chilling and of course, violent, in its end. This film captures the violence and the undercurrent of anger which takes place today in American society, and the blood and gore which is shown visually on the screen only enhances the statement of violence in the film and within American culture.THE HISTORY OF VIOLENCE presents tremendous performances from a cast that really delivers, and is a must see film in 2005.",A History of Violence
203,PCT1970,Cronenberg & Mortensen Create Masterful Violence,8,11 May 2019,"This viewer has seen almost all of Cronenberg's array of films covering different genre. This is hands down has best crime drama in this viewer's opinion. Cronenberg directs a virtuous film. The entire cast deliver splendid performances and includes stars such as Harris, Bello, Hurt and Holmes. This is Mortensen's finest performance aside from ""Captain Fantastic"" and ""Green Book"". However it is Hurt who commands the screen, although his time on screen is limited. His portrayal of a subtle, loving, vindictive, duplicit and brutal brother is mesmerizing. The plot revolves around a conventional family man Tom Stall who owns a diner and lives in a small town in Indiana. His family includes his wife Edie, teenage son Jack and young daughter Sarah. There has been a crime spree taking place and when the two vicious criminals try to rob the diner, Tom disposes of both men with raging animal like instincts. His heroics spread through the media and suddenly he is visited by a facially scarred man Carl who sits at the counter and refers to Tom as Joey. Carl continues to taunt Tom and is claiming Tom is actually a former gangster from Philly that he obviously had a brush with previously. Tom continues to deny the allegations, but his wife Edie and son Jack are suspicious due to the manner in which he took out the robbers. In an ironic discussion Tom talks to Jack about violence and bullying due to an incident at school which causes Jack to run away. This gives Carl the opportunity to snatch Jack up and bring him to the Stall residence in order to force Tom to come with him back to Philly. Carl releases Jack and before he gets in the car Tom's history of violence kicks in. He murders the henchman ferociously, but gets shot by Carl. As he lay there with Carl hovering over him Tom finally admits he is Joey, but before Carl enacts his retribution Jack ambushes him with a shotgun blast. While in the hospital recovering Tom admits he was a hitman that killed for money and thrills, but he left that violence in the past. This drives a wedge between Tom and his family which was already becoming strained. Tom gets a visit from the local sheriff Sam who is confused as to why these men went to all the trouble and eventual death if they weren't sure they had their man. Edie steps in and keeps the façade of Tom being a decent family man going which seems to appease Sam. Even after this act Edie and Jack feel betrayed by the man they thought they knew. Tom receives a call from his brother Richie demanding that he come to Philly or he will just keep dispatching men. Tom meets Richie in Philly. Tom is there to settle the dispute with his brother, but because of his past actions and the inconvenience it caused Richie he has his men ambush Tom. This film has many memorable scenes and quotes. This viewer's favorite scene is the meeting between Tom and Richie. It's symbolic of the strength and loyalty between two different types of families. The plot is intense, thrilling, clever, duplicitous, poetic, rampant, savage, blazing, intelligent, cathartic and has an ambiguous ending. The main theme in this viewer's opinion is that a man can't always receive absolution by leaving his actions in the past. Sometimes your history catches up with you and only the truth can truly set you free. This is a bravura work of art and one of the very best films in it's genre.",A History of Violence

The film stars Viggo Mortensen as Tom Stall, a small town everyman who owns a diner, is married to an attractive lawyer (Maria Bello)and is the father of two children whose life is changed forever when during what appears to be a random act of violence at his diner one night, Tom kills two people in self-defense and in defense of his business and patrons. The publicity that surrounds this event shines an unflattering light around Tom which he is clearly uncomfortable with but we're not sure why until a stranger pulls into town claiming that Tom is not who he says he is. Tom denies the allegation but it eventually becomes clear that Tom is actually a former mafioso named Joey Cusack, who has been tracked down by his brother, with whom he has unfinished business. The slow reveal of this story is quite unsettling because as we watch, we begin to figure out what is going on, but we hope we're wrong. The film not only looks at mob violence, but it also looks at violence as an instrument of self defense; it looks at the possible connection between violence and genetics as Tom's son is observed dealing with a school bully in a rather unsettling way, and it even examines violence between a husband and wife as Tom's world begins to unravel and he attempts to take control of his life again by taking control of his marriage. Mortenson turns in a complex and evocative performance as Tom/Joey, a quiet man driven to extremes as the new life he has constructed for himself begins to fall apart. Maria Bello gives the performance of her career as Tom's wife Edie, who has had the emotional breath knocked out of her marriage and is at a loss as to how to deal with the fact that her entire existence has been a lie. Ed Harris does a bone-chilling turn as the mobster who tracks Tom/Joey down and, as we learned, was disfigured because of him and William Hurt received an Oscar nomination for his flashy turn as Joey's brother, a performance that gets more interesting with multiple viewings. A haunting and powerful film experience that will get inside you and eat away at your soul and provide just as many questions as it does answers.",A History of Violence
205,vailsy,exceedingly average,4,24 June 2006,"firstly the score for this film is distinctly ordinary, and in my opinion brings the whole movie down with it... the sound is extremely similar to 'lord of the rings' which doesn't help mortenson's performance here at allthe story also has several flaws. in particular the lack of police involvement.. they live in a very small town and yet the mob are able to drive around in their black car freely and hassle the family at willi could put all of the above aside, but mainly mortensons past is just not interesting enough to warrant this movies existence. the film had the potential to have much more depth and plot twistsoverall i found the film flat and average, not what i was expecting at all",A History of Violence
206,seaview1,A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE Disturbs the Senses,9,12 October 2005,"This is not a pleasant film. It is about the nature of violence and how humans are forced into violence and its consequences. Master of visceral angst, David Cronenberg, tackles the subject of the present haunted by the past in small town America in A History of Violence. Although its subject matter is disturbing and the visuals are unnerving, it boasts some of the best acting in any film this year and is the most accomplished of Cronenberg's cinematic canon.Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) is a family man who runs a quiet diner in a small town and has the idyllic life of husband to a beautiful, loving wife, Edie (Maria Bello), and father to an adolescent son, Jack (Ashton Holmes), and younger daughter, Sarah (Heidi Hayes). One fateful day a pair of serial criminals barges into the diner looking for trouble in the worst way, and Tom must protect his patrons and staff. What transpires is a remarkable display of self defense and marksmanship as Tom becomes a local hero for his bravery. Soon after, a mysterious, black car begins to stalk Tom and his family at his diner and home. A hardened looking man named Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris) approaches Tom. It seems Tom's notoriety in the media has attracted Fogarty's attention leading him to believe Tom is not who he appears to be but rather a man named Joey with a very dark, violent past. Years ago, this Joey had run from the mob after causing a lot of trouble and mutilating one of Fogarty's eyes. The uneasy tension bubbles over when Fogarty and his men confront Tom at his home as his family watches in terror. What happens then and afterwards leads to traumatic discovery and the reevaluation of relationships that culminates full circle at a mobster's mansion in Philadelphia.Adapted by Josh Olson from the graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke, director Cronenberg displays a sure hand in his scenes of conflict whether they are emotional or violent. How ironic that the Canadian born director comments on the violence in the U.S. He does a nice job of setting up the scenes and characters methodically as we first see a loving family amid an innocent town. Subsequently, an ominous atmosphere of foreboding hangs over the rest of the film. There are some terrific set pieces that culminate in startling violence, and the confrontation at Tom's house is quite memorable and results in a moment of truth. Let it be said that the violence is organic. It grows out of necessity and is carried out brutally and swiftly. The scenes have a lingering trauma on the characters and the audience. The visuals are stark and powerful by cinematographer Peter Suschitzky with a brooding score by Howard Shore (ironically a veteran scorer of previous Cronenberg films and Mortensen's Lord of the Rings trilogy). In fact the film, with its small, peaceful town contrasted with an evil menace, feels like a David Lynch film, and is thematically very much akin to Blue Velvet or Twin Peaks.Ed Harris makes a grand entrance early on and he grabs this juicy role and never lets go. It is certainly one of his finest performances. William Hurt makes you realize just how talented an actor he is in the relatively short but brilliant turn as a mobster from the past with an agenda. But it is lead actor Viggo Mortensen who shines as the reluctant hero. He balances just the right amount of paradoxical innocence and cunning. He is a man about to peer over the precipice and lose everything he has. His brooding, quiet but strong avenger is constantly riveting. Maria Bello is quite touching as the affected wife and mother who is confronted by fear and uncertainty. Even Stephen McHattie registers strongly as one of the baddies (very reminiscent of the scum in Natural Born Killers) at the beginning.Some directors are accused of making movies of interminable length. Not so with Cronenberg as he may be accused of being too economic and concise. While the pacing is tightly edited for maximum impact, some relationships needed to be fleshed out more. During the course of the story, there are two graphic displays of sex between Tom and Edie (one playful and the other angry) which serve as emotional counterpoints to their relationship. We need to understand what is going on in Edie's mind and how she faces the future with her family. While there is a promising development of the early bonding between Tom and his introverted son Jack, we want more exposition of Jack as he goes from harassed school kid to a coming of age. We just needed a bit more character development, but what we do have is pretty thought provoking and unforgettable. The final scene is memorable.A far cry from his notorious horror films, this film delves into the true nature of self and identity. This is Cronenberg's most accessible film since The Fly and The Dead Zone. While his early horror films like Scanners and Videodrome dealt with physical transformation, this film deals with metaphysical transformation. He comes dangerously close to his earlier, notorious cult film, Crash (not to be confused with Paul Haggis' current film), another film about human behavior dealing with psychological change. His films often deal with ugly, sordid truths and secrets that lie beneath what is perceived superficially. A fascinating study and exploration of human behavior under the most extreme duress, A History of Violence is an intelligent, brutal gem of a film not for all tastes, but for those willing to peer on the other side of sanity and complacency, it's a dark slice of unsavory life.",A History of Violence
207,headhunter46,"A roller-coaster ride, shocking and moving.",9,24 June 2006,"The actors/actresses in this movie were very convincing, believable and carried their parts flawlessly. I was drawn into the movie and never once did I get the feeling they were ""acting"". I felt as though I was actually watching the events unfold.This movie depicts as easy-going, mild mannered man who loves his family and operates a local diner. One day some truly evil characters, cold blooded killers, come into his diner and immediately become abusive and threaten with guns. Our mild-mannered family man takes a lucky swipe at the first villain, snatches his gun away and dispatches the second one. Pretty good reflexes for an average guy right? Unfortunately, the news network shows our hero on national news and a few days later, some very menacing people show up and insist our hero is not Tom Stall but rather some guy named ""Joey"" from Philly. I found myself believing that our hero is not Joey but the bad guys won't give it up. They begin to cause trouble for our hero even to the point of following his family around. Their big mistake comes when they grab Tom's son and attempt to use him as a means to coerce our hero into going with them in their big, black car. Our hero, Tom, reacts in a way most men would in defense of their family. The plot thickens and worsens until Tom is forced to go to Philly to meet an even more menacing character there. I won't spoil this movie for you by revealing any more of it but I must say there were surprises galore in the plot which I am certain you will enjoy. I never felt the violence was there just for the sake of it. In every instance, Tom was defending either his customers in the diner, his family, or himself. He never took pleasure in wasting the bad guys as some do in other movies. He didn't smirk or laugh at those he killed. No, our hero did not enjoy killing, he only did it in self defense which is why I think you will identify and perhaps even sympathize with his dilemma. I feel the sex scene on the stairwell was overdone. The plot could easily have had them chasing each other up to the bedroom where she indicated a softening of her anger and let things flow from there. At any rate, this movie has high quality acting, and the plot is relentlessly engrossing. It kept me guessing and on the edge of my seat. It is the best of its type I have seen in a long time.",A History of Violence
208,ryangilmer007,Nice diversion from typical Hollywood,7,13 July 2006,"David Cronenberg's ""A History of Violence"" is a nice character studio over how hard it truly is to overcome a violent nature and the repercussions of falling back into that nature.It this story and in the real world it doesn't matter if the reasons for violence were noble or if external forces are pushing you into returning to them (or both).There are no real excuses other than that the person must take responsibility and in this movie the main character (Viggo) does.The movie is strongly acted and written with a taught sense of urgency.William Hurt once again provides a fascinating evil performance.While the end of the movie does turn toward the dark side, this is in fact that is a breath of fresh air from the common approach which would just add a happy ending to tie things up.Happy endings aren't always what occurs in the real world and as such this brief slice of life is more realistic than otherwise thought.",A History of Violence
209,arthera09,I guess I just did not get this movie,7,24 May 2008,"First of all I would like to say that I like William Hurt and I do not think that this was a nomination worthy performance. I thought his performance was forced and did took away from the movie. I do not think he can pull off the mob boss kind of guy. I would have loved to have seen some one with a more explosive personality that really got p1ssed off. I did not see any rage. I think the role called from someone who could explode and then gain composure quickly and still conscientiously destroy and exploit the people around him. Other than that I loved the movie for the first 2/3. But it kind of went down hill for me in the last bit. I did love the last scene, the whole Philadelphia part was not paced well and the action felt slow and not as intense as the previous scenes. I thought it was a brilliant movie and the writing was fantastic and some really good acting. Someone in the threads was commenting on how the whole bullying thing was not believable, but having seen some of that stuff first hand I think it was actually pretty well done. The action scenes really were something special and ever since Moe on the Simpsons talked about stomping throats I have not scene something that really stood up to the anger that someone must feel in order to stomp on someone throats until this movie. Maria Bello was so perfect and one can see why someone would give up a previous life for her. The family dynamic was excellent and seeing how all of this effected the family was probably my favorite part. I do not agree with the critics for a lot of this movie, but it still was good up to a point and then it just slowed down.",A History of Violence
210,jay4stein79-1,Out of the past come villains and monsters,9,19 March 2006,"Well. since I've just written my review of Good Night and Good Luck, I'll take a similar method of attack here. I'm an ambivalent fan of David Cronenberg, though I think after seeing this film I might become a bit more of a rabid supporter. Everything I heard about this film-- again mostly from my Hollywood friend and reviews--led me to anticipate a letdown with History of Violence. That the film completely enthralled me, I think, may accentuate my admiration of this film (it's the other side of the coin of Good Night and Good Luck--a film I expected to be disappointing was actually one of the best I've seen this year). After a wonderful, languorous opening that, for me, recalled the beginning of Once Upon a Time in the West (I think that was intentional--didn't Henry Fonda shhhhh a child before shooting it?), we find ourselves in the Stall family home. As Cronenberg says on the commentary, it's a little exaggerated, but not completely out of the realm of possibility. I prefer to see these early scenes as sharing the same general DNA as the early scenes in Blue Velvet. There's no ironic montages of fake blue birds and stout men riding old fire trucks, waving, but the sense that we're in Mayberry (excuse me, Lumberton) and all is not what it seems is definitely present thanks to the brilliant opening. The story is engrossing and exciting. It's also appalling. Cronenberg here takes a stab at Sergio Leone/Sam Peckinpah style anti-violence through violence, putting his unique stamp on it. Cronenberg forces us to confront our own blood-lust/lust in the violent scenes here (including the sex scene on the stairs). Sergio Leone would buildup to a violent outcome, and, when we should be getting the ""money shot,"" he cuts too quickly for us to see any real bloodshed. Peckinpah had the opposite m.o. He would slow everything down and show it in all its brutal glory--he would disgust us by drawing out the bloodshed to interminable lengths. Cronenberg brings the gore. You want to see people shot and punched? Fine--I'll show you someone still alive with half their face shot away and I'll show you the bruises on a woman's back from rough, stairway sex and I'll show you noses punched back into people's skulls and throats snapped by feet. The audience becomes complicit in the violence--we want to see if but then find it disturbing. That's the point. The acting is also wonderful. Viggo Mortensen has a commanding presence and Maria Bello brings strength to her character. She is not the traditionally weak woman of action films, but rather can hold her own against thugs. Then there are the two primary villains in Ed Harris and William Hurt. Ed Harris is spectacularly menacing without me being able to pinpoint why. What was wonderful about William Hurt's brief appearance is his ability to show how utterly incompetent a gangster he is. He's never threatening and never really dangerous. He's an oaf and it makes the audience wonder how he got as far as he did. The last thing I'd like to point out is the film's indebtedness to Out of the Past, a great Jacques Tourneur noir starring Robert Mitchum. I find it amusing that none of the reviews I read brought the connection up, since it what I thought of immediately while watching the movie. Criminals come and claim a ""good man"" was once like them--it's the same basic story with different methods of telling it and different outcomes. The story probably wasn't original to Out of the Past, but, for me, it's a well-known antecedent to this film and one that fans of this movie should check out.",A History of Violence
211,grnhair2001,ehhh,4,30 March 2008,"Most people either loved or hated this, but I'm somewhere in the middle. While I'm a Mortensen fan, this is not his best work--not even close. What I like about it: there's no real ending in the Hollywood sense. As it fades at the end, they aren't happy, we aren't happy, and we have no idea what the family is going to do from now on--nor even what we'd like them to do. While you might root for Tom/Joey at some level throughout the movie, he's really not admirable--there is more than the typical white hats-black hats morality at work here. What I don't like: clichéd bully interaction with the teenaged son at school, clichéd small town (Hollywood's view of the Midwest, where none of them have lived or care to actually research in depth), clichéd fight scenes where hero kicks guns out of three opponents' hands, yawn yawn. Sex scenes don't bother me at all, but these were utterly gratuitous; I understand the original screenplay had no sex, and that was a smarter decision than the one the director finally made, keeping the focus on violence. I suspect the director of thinking, well, we've got a look looking babe here who's willing to show her ass, and we're going to get an R or worse rating anyway, so let's do it. This is not a good reason to change a decent screenplay.",A History of Violence

Didn't we just say his name was Tom? What's going on here? I put this movie in the same class as Natural Born Killers, Pulp Fiction and Sin City and may be better than all of them. OK, maybe not better than Sin City. Every actor, and the director, of course, deserve some kind of acting award. It is that good. Let's give them all Best Supporting Actor and Actress Awards except for Mortensen. He gets the Best Actor Award. We can do that, can't we? But, special mention should be given to Maria Bello, Ed Harris and William Hurt. They have really stepped up from previous performances.You are literally riveted to your seat wondering what will happen next. No, it's not an Action Hero kind of movie (and some may take exception to that), but it moves along at a crisp pace and, of course, some things will shock you. And, I mean really shock you. Like NBK, PF and SC didn't? The thing that is most impressive here is that the story is quite simple, and then things become complicated, but still simple enough. Follow?

213,Jamie_Seaton,Probably Cronenberg's best work,8,30 October 2009,"with me not being a big fan of David Cronenberg i was considering on not watching this. i'm glad i did because its very good. some scenes are very notorious and very graphic. Viggo Mortensen plays nice family man that has a very dark secret about his past and its going to come back on him 10 fold. Maria Bello plays a OK part as Tom Stall's (Mortensen) caring and affectionate wife. Ed Harris plays a good part as a mysterious character that knows about Tom Stall's past. i especially liked William Hurts performance, i can see why he got nominated for best support in this. it also got nominated for best screenplay. this is a good film that i think is probably a little too good for Cronenberg's name to be on it. 7.6 on IMDb, a little overrated but not too far off i'm thinking........... 6.8/10.........j.d Seaton",A History of Violence
214,Barky44,"Interesting, but not outstanding",7,16 October 2005,"A History of Violence has an interesting premise. A peaceful, ordinary man in a small Midwest town has an encounter with some very unsavory characters. When the life of a fellow towns person is jeopardized, the ordinary man shows extraordinary prowess ... in killing the attackers. Then there are questions from his family, friends, and neighbors, and then the Mafia shows up. Is he a regular guy, or a trained killer in hiding? I really like the concept, and in the beginning the film shows real promise. Everyone questions: is he or isn't he? It starts to affect his family as well, as it naturally should.Well, eventually we learn the truth about his past. Yes, he was unsavory. But here the film takes a wrong turn. They continue on with the hero/anti-hero traveling to Philly to settle old scores from his violent, criminal past. Big mistake.The interest in this film isn't in the crime story, it's in the story of the man and how he copes. But the filmmakers turn it into a typical crime saga. It goes down the path less interesting, something worthy of Van Damme or Vin Diesel rather than Viggo Mortensen.I'm also not thrilled with one completely pointless sex/rape scene. I know the director was trying to give us insight into the true nature of this man, but the scene was so out of place and distracting it really seemed like the director was simply getting his rocks off rather than making something of import.The film does have some decent performances. Mortensen, Maria Bello as his wife, and Ed Harris all give strong performances. Ashton Holmes as the son does well, too, but William Hurt is horribly miscast and completely unbelievable as one of the villains.7 out of 10. Most points are lost due to the wrong turn in the second act.Barky",A History of Violence
215,deastman_uk,I dreamt my dad was a weirdo,5,6 October 2005,"It took me a bit of time to work out that like his previous film eXistenz, Mr Cronenberg is not actually playing straight with the audience.The theme of a man that is hiding his past plays out in front of us. But suddenly we enter some sort of phantasmagorical element. Not in an immediate or obvious way like in most of the directors films, but little things that appear, or don't happen. The family characters are somehow interchangeable. Events somehow lack conviction as if in a dream. The bits that do (yes, like the sex scenes) are out of context.But I'm not quite sure I care. Unfortunately the film plays like a fairly implausible thriller, and thats what sticks in the mind. As well as how pretty Maria Bello is.",A History of Violence

The performances are strong, and the cinematography is excellent throughout, with bursts of action particularly impressive.While there's no body horror, this crime drama is typical Cronenberg, containing the usual graphic sex and gory violence associated with the director; and this is another solid addition to his filmography.7.5/10",A History of Violence

Naturally, this being Cronenberg, there's also some uncomfortable-looking sex and enough splattery gunplay to counter the cerebral stuff.A pair of lowlifes get proceedings off to a nasty start before we are introduced to Tom Stall and his nice-as-pie family in a couple of scenes that veer dangerously close to The Waltons territory. Thankfully, the the schmaltz is ground under foot when the aforementioned lowlifes come to town.Viggo Mortensen is well cast as the not-quite-ordinary Joe, and Maria Bello offers typically doughty support as his wife, but it's a shame that Ed Harris' one-eyed mobster isn't around for longer.

220,spacemonkey_fg,Great actors + Good director = Excellent Film,10,23 March 2006,"Title: A History of Violence (2005) Director: David Cronenberg Cast: Vigo Mortensen, Ed Harris, William Hurt, Maria Bello, Ashton HolmesReview: David Cronenberg. The name is synonymous with films dealing with violent and sexual content matter. Films like The Fly, Videodrome, Rabid, Shivers, eXistence, Scanners and Crash all deal with the dark, violent and sexual side of the human nature. Of course all those movies were sprinkled in one way or another with sci-if/horror elements. I personally became accustomed to seeing Cronenberg address his usual themes mixed with some sort of fantasy, yet here comes A History of Violence a film without a single creature, monster or decease to be seen. What is this new fiction less Cronenberg like? Do his films still rock without a fantastic element to aid them? The story in this film revolves around Tom Stall. A guy who lives a seemingly perfect family life. He has a beautiful wife, a cute little girl and a happy go lucky teenager. He has his own little diner in a small town in the middle of hickville USA. Basically the guy lives a quiet happy life with his family and friends. But one day a pair of certified evil doers walk into his diner and decide to rob the place. Things get a little hairy when Toms heroics make him an instant celebrity and a part of his hidden past begins to resurface.The strength in this movie are the incredible performances. We have a very strong cast filled with seasoned veterans that bring these characters to life. Viggo Mortensen does good as Tom, the guy you'd love to have as a neighbor or a boss. The all around nice guy. Of course the guy has a dark hidden side to him and Mortensen played well the role of a guy trying to repress those darker impulses. Ed Harris playing a gangster type in search for Tom does a very memorable job as one of the villains in the film. He truly devours this role and portrays a cool and calculating villain who means business. And in this movie we don't get just one memorable villain but two, since in an interesting turn of events William Hurt actually plays a villain in this film. I'm used to seeing Hurt play the nice guy, the caring father not the cold hearted villain. And this makes the character all the more interesting.Maria Bello as Toms wife did a fine performance as a sexy wife who will go out of her way to make her man happy. Even doing some role playing games when in bed. If you're a guy, you'll love the scene where she dresses up as a cheerleader to make Tom feel like he is a teenager all over again. And speaking of teenagers, Ashton Holmes playing Toms son did a very good performance as well as a kid trying to avoid violence in school, but ultimately succumbing to it. So all in all we get some really good performances from everybody involved.And how about that good old fashion Cronenberg violence? Well it is toned down in this film when compared to the all the gore seen in his previous films. This movie focuses more on its themes and story and performances then in shocking you with its gore. But when violence does occur its very significant and yes, still shocking. Like the short controlled burst of a machine gun, in this flick, Cronenberg controls the levels of violence, but when he does fire them at us, the are just as shocking as anything he has ever done. There are some truly intense moments on this one.This is one of Cronenbergs best films. And this comes from a guy who has seen almost all of his films. This movie demonstrates a sure steady hand in storytelling. This is one dose of sex and violence you wont want to miss. Nothing bad to report on this one.Rating: 5 out of 5",A History of Violence
221,widescreenguy,when push comes to shove,8,22 April 2006,this film works on a number of levels.the scene when the son finally retaliates against the school bullies gives one a sense of good for him. then there is the issue of the extreme violence the lead character is subjected to and commits. and then gradually the truth leaks out.and then the point is made about all this sudden extreme violence is just a 'sign of the times'.one is left with the philosophical question if people can truly change and at what point do we finally get to leave the past behind us.cronenburg is noted for numerous slasher type movies with a great deal of violence.

The movie starts out with Viggo Mortensen living in a small made up town in Indiana with his wife and two kids. His wife is a lawyer and he runs a small restaurant and both his kids are in school. Then one day two men walk in looking to rob the place and Mortensen kills both of them and everyone thinks he's a hero. Then Ed Harris shows up in a black car and a black suit saying that Mortensen isn't who is says he is and that he used to live in Philadelphia and was involved in the mob.

223,FilmSnobby,Seed money for the next project that Cronenberg REALLY wants to do.,3,5 October 2005,"While watching *A History of Violence*, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was watching little more than a violent revenge-fantasy, of the type usually promulgated by nerds. The chatty denizens of IMDb confirmed my suspicion: it turns out that the movie is based on a COMIC-BOOK. Oops, sorry -- ""graphic novel"". I suppose the title should have been the giveaway, for ""graphic novels"" tend to have pretentious titles. Pretentious, sub-literate text and pretentious drawings, too, but that's neither here nor there. The larger point is that whoever wrote this tawdry tale -- and I'm sure he -- and I'm sure it's a ""he"" -- is revered as a genius in Comic-Con Land -- is clearly re-working the Hulk story from Marvel Comics: mild-mannered David Banner-type goes berserk, dispatching two bloodthirsty nut-cases who hold up his Small Town, Indiana, diner. ""You won't LIKE me when I'm angry,"" as Bill Bixby pointed out more than once.So Viggo Mortensen turns out to be amazingly, and unbelievably, competent in hand-to-hand combat and with firearms, firing a Glock 9 like a ten-year veteran of Special Forces, U.S. Army. Otherwise, he's utterly normal, a family man with a pretty wife and two kids. He is, in other words, the perfect ""graphic novel"" hero: a man whose ""superpowers"" or ""dark side"" or what-have-you stretch far beyond the point of credibility. Which wouldn't be so bad if ""graphic novels"" weren't otherwise drearily realistic. ""The Hulk"" comics series never pretended to be anything more than fantasy. But we're actually supposed to buy the characters and situations of this ""realistic"", ""graphic novel"". The viewer, meanwhile, will roll his eyes in exasperation when it's revealed that Mortensen might have once been a hit-man for a Philadelphia crime-syndicate who ran away from ""the life"" some twenty years prior. An Irish-mob enforcer? Please. Have you ever seen hit-men? Remember Sammy ""The Bull"" Gravano or whatever his name was? Or what about those fat, out-of-shape creeps we all saw standing around on the sidewalk with Gotti, courtesy of those FBI surveillance tapes? A mobster's only muscle is his gun. But in *A History of Violence*, Mortensen is still in Strider Mode, in perfect physical condition, still combat-ready after twenty freaking years. I don't buy it, guys.Maybe I'm getting hung up on the plot, when I should be praising Cronenberg's ""daring commentary"" on Violence In America, for that's what the majority of the professional film critics seem to be talking about. Which is disheartening, incidentally. Now I've read some of the reviews at IMDb, and some of the smart folks here -- amateur critics, and the more honorable for it -- have already pointed out that Cronenberg's presumed thesis about the inevitability of violence is rendered hypocritical by his absolute GLORYING, his unabashed WALLOWING in the violence he throws up on the screen. Yes, the blood is more copious than in the usual action picture; the effect of bullets tearing into flesh and bone SEEMS to look realistic (though who knows or wants to know?); when someone gets his nose smashed deep into his own skull, it looks genuinely ugly and the camera lingers on the view in a tough-minded fashion. So what? Does Cronenberg really think he's above the fray? If his plan is to pander to the lowest common denominator of an audience which KNOWS it's being pandered to, well, he's still pandering. Clever, self-reflective ""knowingness"" doesn't absolve him -- or us. This movie belongs in that special group of films like *A Clockwork Orange*, *Irreversible*, and a few others, in which the director and the audience make a cynical pact to exploit each other's festering desire to take a holiday from civility, allowing one and all to indulge the baseness of our common natures even as we rationalize this immature behavior by sprinkling high-minded phrases like ""violence in our modern culture"" like so much intellectual sugar over the whole bloody mess.Presumably, Cronenberg signed on to do this lazy hack-work in order to get his next *Spider* or whatever made. Fine, but we have to live with this one in the meantime. I'm giving it 3 stars, instead of 1, out of 10 because, though inherently contemptible, it's also competently done, in terms of narrative brevity, camera placement (especially during the action scenes), and the startling pair of husband-and-wife sex scenes: Cronenberg makes us ponder a rowdy, lustful 69 scene early in the film when Mortensen and Bello are happily married, and a ""hate-f--k"" scene on hard wood stairs when they're not so happily married later in the film. Been a while since we've seen such married carnality. We might, in fact, have to go all the way back to Roeg's *Don't Look Now* to find it. Perhaps Cronenberg's next picture -- the arty one I'm sure he really wants to make -- will be a remake of *Eyes Wide Shut*. The two scenes here are more shocking than Kubrick's final opus in its entirety.",A History of Violence

Ed Harris was a good antagonist along with William Hurt, but I never felt like Mortensen could have actually been a gangster. I do like how the director never explained how Mortensen was able to get a new identity though. It leaves the answer to the imagination.The movie was also obscenely violent (as you'd expect) and surprisingly sexual. I've always wondered just how close to having sex actors get on film, but this more or less answered my question. Most of the violence was, ahem, nothing I haven't seen before, but I teared up a bit when the little girl was killed. This film takes a rather strong stomach to watch, but it's good.",A History of Violence

Joey Cusack(Viggo Mortenson) is a former mob hit-man who has established a new life and identity as the owner of a small town diner. As Tom Stall, he becomes a peaceful and mild mannered family man, and his wife (Bello)knows nothing of his previous career.When two thugs looking for money attack his waitress, Tom becomes his former self and brutally kills the assailants. The national acclaim he receives attracts Carl Fogarty (Harris), a mobster who has wanted to kill Joey for years. When Fogarty and his men come to town, the body count increases and Joey's new family becomes increasing puzzled about the identity of the man they thought they knew. Joey wants to shield his family and keep things the way they were, but circumstances make this impossible. Joey is like a former gunfighter who is forced to take up arms again when he and his family are threatened by men from his past. Hurt plays Joey's crime boss brother. The direction, writing and editing are excellent. The acting is powerful and convincing particularly from Harris, Hurt and Bello. This is a film you can watch again and again.",A History of Violence
227,jindann,"average movie, highly overrated",5,16 June 2021,"Story is slow paced but isn't too boring, the acting is actually ok. But the biggest problems of this movie when you think of it is actually quite silly. How can a person living a life of crime, having a ton of rivals and enemies in the past being so careless showing his face in front of the medias with his own family exposing them to all sorts of dangers? When you think of loopholes like this the movie becomes ridiculous. He should be so familiar with the ways of the crime family, that doesnt forgive and forget, that he and his family should have been gone and disappear right after the first incident, but instead he continues to live his life like nothing has happened, even when the threats were coming again and again which is ludicrous. The way the mobsters handle the matter is again completely stupid, which they should have enter his house and taken his family as hostage while hes at work with guns pointing at their heads, and they have had so many opportunities to really kill him and his family, but instead doing it in the dumbest methods possible . This goes the same with his brother which have a ton of chances to take him down but instead they chose the most stupid of ways like what ed harris did. These flaws totally destroys the credibility of the movie, which could have been so much better if they were on the run trying to evade the hitman.

He has a family of four including a loving wife named Edie(Maria Bello). Everything is normal until one night, just before closing his diner, two murderous crooks start trouble. In a bold attempt of defending his self and others in the diner, Tom kills both men and becomes a local hero overnight.After being released from the hospital he is almost immediately bombarded by reporters and and small group of men led by Carl Fogarty(Ed Harris) who claim that Tom Stall is not what he seems. A trail of deceit and violence takes the family spiraling downhill where Tom must face his past.Effectiveness would describe the movie in general. Mortensen and Bello were tremendously effective. Their acting helped a relatively simple movie evolve into something more. They brought a sense of realism that is very hard to find in todays cinema. The excess of violence was also very effective. It makes the eyes squint when visualizing, showing the magnitude of each situation but also puts in humorous remarks to re-soften the mood.

And then dude was like d-u-u-u-de and then I was like d-u-u-u-de. Sorry, got lost in the moment.

First we meet the unnamed ""bad guys,"" who drive around from small town to small town, robbing and killing for no particularly specified reason. Then we meet Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensenmmm, Viggo) and his perfect family. Things start to get good when the ""bad guys"" try to rob Tom Stall's small town diner, and Stall beats the s*** out of them. News of his heroic acts spread across the country, and with his face on everyone's nightly news, enemies from Stall's past come back to haunt him.If you're at all sensitive towards excessive violence and gratuitous sex, then this is not the film for you, because those are the only entertaining moments in the whole movie. Some of the fights are wicked cool and some of the sex is hardcore (I swear they're doing 69 on screen), but beyond that, all that's left is a slow start and a completely anti-climactic ending.

234,stevetseitz,still waters run deep,7,29 March 2006,"The pacing and style of ""A History of Violence"" really transform what could have been a pedestrian tale of identity and hidden past into a superb thought-provoking yarn.Quality performances enhance the excellent cinematography and the ""Cronenberg"" knack for interesting details.I truly felt for Tom/Joey and, like him, wanted for everything to return to normalcy for him and his family.The actual acts of violence aren't really as frightening as the loss of that sense of normalcy and trust that families need.Even with an questionable (rotten?) past, we sense that the character fleshed out by Viggo Mortenson is a man looking for peace, decency and dignity in a world where violence, evil and disgrace are becoming all too common.Thank you David Cronenberg! You have become seemingly one of the first directors who finally filmed a beautiful and erotic love scene between (gasp!) a husband and a wife. (I am of course speaking of their first encounter.) It's sort of a nice change of pace in a movie world populated by incestuous, adulterous, pedophilic perverted lechers, to see some good old-fashioned physical attraction and intimacy between a husband and wife.",A History of Violence

236,cdelacroix1,History of Violence is a Story of Coping ... and Redemption,9,1 October 2005,"What an amazing movie! Great plot, great story, great execution ... what's not to like? The basic character theme is really nothing new. A quiet man who has a sharply contrasting violent side ... dates back to Shane ... and To Kill a Mockingbird ... and more recently to The Bourne Identity.What is different here ... is in the expert depiction of the quiet man in situ, in his life of peace, of quiet, of happiness. And in making this life appealing. It's so easy to make such a life sound like a classic bore. Yet nothing of the kind is here. This man's life in the small town is unfolded for us very quietly, with vast understatement, and yet in some way it sounds so compelling, so convincing, and so very very engaging. This is a good life, a life that has depth and meaning and desirability: fun, enjoyable. This is no small feat, in our jaded time, to render such a life genuinely engaging. The last time this was achieved on film that I can think of was with Nicholas Cage & Tea Leoni in The Family Man.The community was utterly believable and appealing in a way that brings Mayberry to mind from the old Andy Griffith show. This small community of appeal seems to be a recurrent theme these days. No where better done than here. And ... small thing but I've just got to note it ... I want to celebrate the decision to depict the small-town sheriff in a believable and home-spun yet very professional, very competent depiction. Nice to see a small-town law enforcement officer not treated as a bumbling clown in a movie for a change.The acting (and casting) in this movie are just plain wonderful. Throughout, no exceptions. Viggo Mortensen is perfect in his role. Maria Bello is always good, this was no exception. Like Tea Leoni in The Family Man ... does an absolutely splendid job of raising the ante on domestic happiness ... and does so with utter believability. Ed Harris and William Hurt were flawless. And young Ashton Holmes as Jack turns in an extraordinarily sophisticated acting job for one so young.Back to the Story. For it is the Story that really carries this movie. We have this wonderful in situ representation of the Quiet Man ... and these bursts of violence that intrude with a gradualism and incongruity and brutality ... that truly seem to make this movie a History of Violence in more than one way. For throughout, we have this clear indication that the Quiet Man has this (personal) History of Violence. And at the same time, there is almost a sense of archetypal unfolding of how Violence traces its history in the history of humankind.When I *first* saw the title of the movie, honestly, this was what first came to my mind. Sort of like a History of Greece or a History of World War II. A History of Violence. Later I realized that the title referred to an almost clinical individual profile, the kind of thing you might see in a clinical history of a psychopath, or on a police blotter: this man has a History of Violence. But of course so does humankind. And in both senses we have in this movie a History of Violence.How the lead character ... and those around him ... cope with his personal history of violence ... is a true microcosm for how the community ... and the world ... copes with our universal history of violence.I don't want to give away the ending. But will say this. It is of a piece with the film: and suggests both Redemption ... and the need for ongoing Coping with what is an ongoing Story ... and an ongoing History ... of Violence.",A History of Violence
237,das417,A History of why David Cronenberg Shouldn't Direct,5,3 October 2005,"After finishing watching A History of Violence, I was left with the question of what it was it thought about it. Did I like it? Did I not like it? It was one of those movies where I couldn't make up my mind as soon as it was over. After a day of indecision, I have decided for the latter and here is why I have that decision.Though A History of Violence has a good story, interesting characters, and good acting, it suffers from poor pacing and directing. Sluggish most of the time, it then throws in a few moments of graphic violence and sex as if to remind us why we are watching a movie with such a title. It almost tries to hard to focus on the 'violence' of the film while sacrificing other elements of story telling.Tom Stall (played by Viggio Mortensen) is an average American living in an average American town in the heartland of Indiana. He has a devoted wife (Maria Bello), and two average kids named Jack and Sarah (Ashton Holmes and Heidi Hayes). Their lives are normal and rather easy going as most people's lives are in small American towns.Then, one day, everything changes.After preventing a robbery and killing two thieves, Tom Stall becomes an 'American Hero'. Though he tries to shy away from such titles, the sudden fame brings up a past 'Tom' wants to desperately forget about in the form of three strangers dressed in dark suits who follow the orders of Mr. Fogarty (the always welcomed Ed Harris) who arrive and only refer to him as 'Joey'.It is then that the problems begin for A History of Violence. Though the movie does not fall into the typical 'action' movie ideal where the good guy immediately kills all the bad guys after some clever lines, the story sudden stalls (no pun intended) and almost comes to a complete halt. We are treated to vague threats and hints of a past of 'Tom' that are the supposed crux of this movie but really don't go anywhere. Oh, and Jack ends up beating the two bullies harassing him. Can't forget that part, can I? After a threat made to Jack on his own property, 'Tom' reverts to his 'Joey' alter ego and kills two of the dangerous men while Jack does away with Mr. Fogarty himself. In doing so, Tom reveals to his family who he really is and there is no escaping that reality.If this were the end of the movie then there would be a solid conclusion for A History of Violence. Instead, Conenberg drives the story forward with a final confrontation with Richie Cusak (William Hurt), the brother Joey Cusak has been running from for all these years. More graphic killing (as the tile of the movie implies) and then, quite literally, the movie ends with Joey returning to his family in time for an uncomfortable dinner.I had high hopes for this movie but the above mentioned slow pacing and poor direction ruined any real affect A History of Violence could of had. What could have been am interesting story of a man being forced to face his past and how his instead becomes slow and pondering and fill with rather bad 'Philly' accents. I blame this on David Cronenberg alone. Direction, or lack of, is what prevented this movie from being as enjoyable as it should.5 out of 10",A History of Violence
238,Movieguy_blogs_com,This is the best performance by William Hurt in his entire career.,8,27 September 2005,"In 'A History of Violence' Viggo Mortensen is Tom Stall, a proprietor of a small diner in a small town. When some out-of-town bad guys come to the diner and start some serious trouble, Tom takes them both out. Suddenly overnight Tom is a local hero.Now that Tom's picture is on every news program, more bad guys from Philly think he is the crazy Joey Cusack (a mob hit-man wanted by the mafia). When these guys show up, things start to get interesting.This movie was really good up until the ending. It keeps you interested throughout the movie, but suddenly ends on a confusing note. I hate that! However, I also think this is the best performance by William Hurt (Richie Cusack) in his entire career.Overall, I thought the whole cast did a superb job (Maria Bello, Ed Harris, etc.).

In the so called movie, we meet our protagonist Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen), a normal dad, well it seems like that anyway. When he is forced to kill two people, to save the life of a woman, his past starts to catch up with him...""A History of Violence"" is directed by David Cronenberg. He did a very good job at directing it. What also added to the movie was that he'd worked with Viggo Mortensen before (Eastern Promises). He also used some shots, that not a lot of movies would dare to use, but it worked in this movie. He has his own special style, which is a very good style. That he has his own style is also a good thing, you can have your own style like Micheal Bay, but also like Christopher Nolan, and he is reaching to the Nolan side. If that made some sense for you. The cinematography was good too, every shot looked pretty, and I don't really have to say anything else about this part. Like my title says there is a lot of violence, well not just my title, but also the title of the movie. The violence is done very good. The blood looked great, just like the gore. Not at one point in the movie I would say that it was obviously fake. Theses scenes were also very well directed. How he showed you things, and some things not, so there could be a reveal. But he also forced you to look at specific things in these shots. Birilliantly directed. The soundtrack of the movie was very good too, so was the costume design. The sound, not the soundtrack, was well edited and chosen. The issue that I have with the movie, is that there were some moments that it felt like they dubbed over some of the movie parts. An example is early on in the movie when Tom and his wife are sitting in the car, and having a conversation. The make-up of the eye of Fogarty was also very good. You knew that it was fake, but it looked convincing enough. The editing was good to, I only managed to catch one mistake, so that's good. (The son switches arm position between edits in the locker room)The acting was one of the big and best parts. The main character, our protagonist, is like I've said, Tom Stall. Tom was played by Viggo Mortensen. I knew that he could act from seeing ""The road"" and the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, but I think that he did one of his best acting jobs in this movie. He was very convincing as a normal house dad, but also how he could make the switch in becoming a killer called Joey, his past self. On the characters I'll touch a bit later on in this review. But he was very good. The next person I'm going to talk about is his wife. She is called Edie Stall, and was played by the lovely Maria Bello. She was very good too. From her we got to see a more emotional side, which she handled very well. This is a hard part for some actors, but not for her. The antagonist of ""A History of Violence"" was Carl Fogarty, he was played by Ed Harris. Ed Harris is a very good villain. In this movie, but also in a lot of other movies. You also have the helpers of the story, these are the son and daughter of Tom. The son had a bigger role. He was very good. The rest of the supporting cast was good as well.The script was for me the best part of the movie, followed by the acting. The dialogue was good, and funny even at moments. The characters were well created and original. For example the interesting character of Tom. You were left in the dark with him, and slowly as the movie progressed, you got to know more of him. This was a very good feature. You could guess what was going on, but you weren't entirely sure about it. The story was good too, just one thing that I didn't like, but what was necessarily to the story. This was the side storyline of the son and his cliché bully. At first I thought that it was just one cliché bit, and that it was unnecessarily, but this builds up to a character arc. And eventually to a similar one, again. This was a Love-Hate part for me. The other characters were also well made, but not always developed. This wasn't something that would add to the movie, so I'm glad that they didn't put big effort in that. The story decreases in quality for me near the end. It still stays good, but not as good as the previous part, that's why the movie loses a point, for me and goes from a nine to a 8.1. That was my review for the ""A History of Violence"". I think that this was a very good movie, it's dark and gritty. It has great characters and great violence. 8.1/10",A History of Violence
240,jimi99,nothing to say,3,10 January 2006,"""A History of Violence"" is the worst kind of nihilism: Family Value nihilism. It has really nothing to say, besides the most obvious: big city gangsters bad, small-town life in rural Indiana good, especially if you wear a crucifix that gleams and love your family intensely. It does do the ""violent gene passed on to son"" faux myth better than the awful ""Road to Perdition,"" that old blood-drenched rite of passage we all can relate to as American males. But it still deals in stereotypical characters, the dialogue is clunky even for an exercise in graphic murder and mayhem, and the ending is every bit as nihilistic as ""Taxi Driver.""

For example man as head of the family, twin identities, repressed desires, quiet little town and seedy big city, violence in school/ family/ sex etc.By Cronenberg's standards this is almost black comedy, though the ending sequence is extremely powerful: Tom having diner with his own family amidst neurotic tension, just after he has disposed of his ""old"" family. Essentially, Cronenberg explores the same ideas as in ""Spider"" but here in a larger (and more mainstream) context.

242,Aristides-2,A to Z spoilers,1,26 May 2006,"Nominated for Best Screen writing? Someone kidding here? Script was riddled with improbable situations as well as preposterous ones. At one point several scenes in a row reminded me of the olden days of TV's, ""Movie of the Week"" where scene after scene were so created THAT EACH ONE WAS THE VERY OPPOSITE OF BELIEVABILITY! To name some: 1) The classic bad guys at the beginning go into a small town restaurant at closing time(8 pm? 9 pm?) and instantly go about setting the customers/owner up for, not a robbery since they're out of mony, but a rape, at the front of the store, WITHOUT LOWERING THE BLINDS! 2. Tom Stall's wife is a lawyer but must not have many paying clients SINCE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE THE FAMILY'S SECOND VEHICLE REPAIRED causing her poor husband to have to walk to work! 3. The captain of the Philadelphia mob (with two of his armed soldiers present) who Tom has viciously blinded in one eye, using barbed wire(!) recognizes him from the national coverage he's gotten for earlier derring-do,THEN DOESN'T JUST EXECUTE HIM SILENTLY BUT MAKES A CONSPICUOUS, MORONIC SPECTACLE OF HIMSELF FOLLOWING TOM AROUND TOWN! 4. These same gangsters show up at Tom's house, daylight, having kidnapped his son. The wife and Tom, inside the house, see the car pull up and the bad guys show up with the kid in tow. THE WIFE FAILS TO CALL 911 AND ASK FOR HELP! 5. Same scene: With his father about to be shot, after his Bruce Lee bit disarming and killing the two soldiers, the son SILENTLY PICKS UP A SHOTGUN LYING CLOSE TO WHERE THE CAPTAIN, who apparently has no peripheral vision in his one remaing eye, IS STANDING AND SHOOTS THE GUY TO DEATH. 6. At this point in the movie Tom has had nationwide publicity for shooting two sociopaths to death, but when he kills two more Mafia-types while at the same time his son kills a mob captain NOT ONLY ARE THERE NO REMOTE VANS NESTING ON HIS FRONT LAWN BUT NO ONE IN THE PRESS OR IN LAW ENFORCEMENT THINKS OF CHECKING HIS PAST, ie. fingerprints anyone? 7. Local sheriff is ""suspicious"" and comes to the house to ask some ""tough questions"" but is disuaded BY TOM'S WIFE WHEN SHE SHOWS EMOTIONAL SUPPORT FOR HER HUSBAND. 8.Pacificist 16 year old son, who the writers purposefully show as a non athlete, has a scene where he shows great street violence and expertise and KICKS THE STUFFINGS OUT OF THE BULLY, WHO BASICALLY STANDS THERE AND MAKES HARDLY ANY MOVE TO PROTECT HIMSELF OR STRIKE BACK. And more and more of this kind of illogical and poorly thought out story and plot. Oh yes, one more, one of my favorites: Tom's brother, inside the brothers multi-million dollar mansion, has one of two goons try and garrote Tom in his office, but Tom, who manages to get a hand between his neck and the garrote (fair enough), wrestles the goon to the floor and while they're wrestling on the floor THE OTHER GOON AS WELL AS THE BROTHER, BOTH OLDER SEASONED GANGSTERS, DON'T GET THEIR GUNS OUT TO MAKE SURE THE TOM'S KILLING TAKESPLACE. THEY PAY FOR THIS WITH THEIR LIVES! I could go on and on but will end this review with an alternate title for this movie: ""Histrionics of Violence in Violent Movies, Part Ad Nauseum.

Our myths, our religions, our fiction, and are non-fiction are paved with violence. From a simple game of dodge ball the ongoing war in Iraq our lives are filled with violence. David Cronenberg's A History of Violence is a tale of a simple act of heroic violence and how even if you don't plan on ""living by the sword"" sometimes the sword is thrown into your lap.Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) has a simple life. He owns a diner in a tiny little Indiana town. There he makes sandwiches, slings burgers, pours coffee, and make a darn fine piece of pie. He has a beautiful family, his wife (Maria Bello) adores him, his son looks up to him, and his daughter is just so darn precocious. His world is rocked when two men try to violently rob the diner. Tom shoots to kill, setting up a series of events that will shake him and his families life forever.A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE is one of those movies that tries to turn the familiar thriller on its head. It succeeds sometimes and at other times it clunks along offering very few questions as to why things are happening. When the film finally reveals itself, your left holding a bag of half thought out ideas, and performances that aren't quite believable enough to add up to a film worth spending your hard earned time and energy on.Mortensen and Bello carry the film. It's a tough job and you can tell both actors are trying really hard to save it. Unfortunately Mortensen is given a character that has no real life. He just floats in and out of reality, and when all is said and done I wasn't sure if his Tom could be who he says he is. The final act puts him in a house with John Hurt. The scene is so stilted it's as of Cronenberg told Mortensen to back off. It's Hurt's time to shine. Hurt mugs to the camera creating a character who is all performance and no life.As for Bello she's asked to pull her character through some even bigger hurdles. But again the material she's given leaves no room for subtlety. So you watch as this character runs the gamut of emotions for what? I'm not really sure. One minute she's big and brash the next she's sullen. Some better motivation would have lifted her performance out of the gutter. But alas she's good, just not that good.A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE is another head scratching question asking ride that will have you leaving the theater ready for a night of discussion. But at the end of the road you'll probably find that there was nothing profound to learn from it, and you won't really be entertained by it. You might like this film bout you probably won't love it.",A History of Violence
244,darin-wissbaum,A history on how to make a bad movie...,1,17 August 2009,"Nothing more than a cheap action film Masquerading as some deep thinking film on violence. If there was some deep level or point that David Cronenberg was trying to get across I must have missed it. A guy (Viggo Mortensen) now living in some small town running a café who has a violent past (in the Mafia I guess) kills two men who try to rob his café. Now his name is in all the papers and he becomes worried by this. Why? Because he does not want his past to be known or the people out there still looking for him that have a contract on his head. Ed Harris and William Hurt play the bad guys who come after him or send a lot of guys after him who end getting shot, stabbed and beat with a shovel in the process. Then there is the ending with Hurt and his thugs at his mansion. What happens there? Strangulations, shootings and beatings. The good guy Mortensen (if you can call him that) returns home and life goes on. Give me a break!!!",A History of Violence
245,eonbluedan-1,Absolutely superb,10,1 January 2011,"Family man Tom Stall runs a coffee shop in a quiet town. The shop is visited by two criminals, and through an act of bravery and unprecedented violence, Tom becomes the local hero. As he and his family attempt to return to normality, in walk another group who do not belong, headed up by a Mr Foggarty, demanding Tom admit he is not who he claims to be. It is the calling into question of Tom's identity that sets the stage for this Cronenberg classic.The film's strengths are numerous. First, there is not a weak link in the cast; even the people we haven't seen before (most notably Tom's son, Jack) turn in great efforts. Maria Bello may as well be married to Viggo Mortensen, Ed Harris is his usual intimidating, brilliant self, and in a role that can't take up more than ten minutes' screen time, William Hurt almost steals it with a character unlike any he has played before. Then we have the formidable Viggo giving a clever, studied, subtle, utterly convincing performance as Tom. Just how studied and subtle it is, in fact, becomes clearer on repeat viewing. He is the new master of the understated performance, understanding the power of low-key finesse in a way that echoes the likes of De Niro and Spacey. The theme of violence being fundamental to the human condition joins the more common ones in Cronenberg's work: questions of identity and the complex duality of human nature. The latter of these is examined at its closest with two very different, very deliberate love scenes, which Cronenberg put into the film himself (they were never part of the original graphic novel). The first is a scene that shows us just how beautiful and fun sex should be between a couple this deeply in love, and is a pure joy to watch; the second is a superb juxtaposition that properly challenges the audience.From a technical perspective, there really isn't anything wrong with this film. It looks great, the score, by long time Cronenberg collaborator Howard Shore, does exactly what it is supposed to do, underpinning every moment of tension and drama. Cronenberg's talent allows him to work through a few different tones, including, at points, dark humour. There is in fact a scene you could believe had been written by Tarantino, which doesn't sound like it should work in such an otherwise serious film, but it is perfect.The review wouldn't be complete without mentioning the violence, of course. It is straightforward, without glamour or sheen, instant, sloppy, and always justified. It is this that interests Cronenberg, how we justify violence, and even applaud it. We fully appreciate the violence we see is necessary, but he wants us to acknowledge it isn't a light subject we just brush over. Regardless of how right it seems, real violence is never pretty, and should stay with you; it should change you. The technique of manipulating the audience, making them complicit in the violence, is not a new one; Kubrick and Tarantino are both famous for it, but when Cronenberg does it, it is to ensure that, whilst cheering, we understand what we're cheering. This ties nicely back in with that Croneberg theme of duality.A perfect, provocative film for a mature audience, with a closing scene that may disappoint those who haven't been paying attention. It haunts, and provokes.",A History of Violence

However, this time it was something brilliant.Apart from some Cronenberg-trademark gore scenes of fighting and killing, the movie follows a relatively steady pace that slowly gives rise to menacing tension. What was brilliant about A History of Violence is that it shakes the subconscious solid bond that the viewers usually create with the protagonist. This unspeakable act of confidence and the natural identification with the protagonist are infringed by the whirling circles of suspicion that the viewer finds himself entangled into.Viggo Mortensen and Maria Bello gave some plausibly mature performance. And Ed Harris was a wonderful addition to the cast as usual.",A History of Violence

This film ventures away from his usual horror/ extreme sexuality focus & is a very well put together crime drama/suspense thriller. I love all of his earlier films, with the exception of Dead Ringers & Crash, but he has made probably his career defining film, with Ahistory Oof Violence. Viggo Mortensen was fantastic as a man with a Mafia past that he has hidden from his family,his community & mainly & most importantly his self. When the creeps come a knocking, he has to explain his self to his very confused & hurt wife,played excellently by the always good Maria Bello, & defend himself against Ed Harris ( who is also great in this film) & his goons & he does so quite well, in probably the goriest death scenes outside of a horror film, I've seen in a long time!

249,hesketh27,Taken in by the reviews!,2,4 October 2005,"I saw the trailer for this film a while ago and thought it looked promising. When it was released here last week, the reviews in all the papers I have read have been overwhelmingly positive and I looked forward to going along to see it. Well - I went last night and I must say that I was mightily disappointed! The film started off well and the entry of Ed Harris and pals kept it moving along nicely. I felt there was potential for much further development of their role but after they are no longer in it, the film starts to go down hill fast. I am afraid that I found the sex scenes totally gratuitous and that they had no real place in the film. The full frontal of Maria Bello - what the hell was that for? The handling of the school bullies by Stall's son was just laughable and there are more holes in the plot than Swiss cheese! To top it all, a fine actor like William Hurt manages to turn in a ludicrous performance as a pantomime villain. I suppose its best not to analyze films too much because it can spoil your enjoyment, but the more I think about this one, the worse it seems. This really is a turkey I'm afraid and if Steven Seagal or Jean Claude Vandamme had played Tom Stall (and it is that kind of film), I'm sure it would have gone straight to video!",A History of Violence
250,alexkolokotronis,Falls Short,4,22 February 2008,"A History of Violence to me was a very mediocre movie to me. It built up the suspense for the first hour making you wonder who is this guy and why did he change his identity. Yet the ending was horrible, it really brought the wrong type of closure and really made me feel like I wasted my time. Technically this movie was not that well made either. The acting, the cinematography, music and writing were all very mediocre and filled with clichés.First of all the fact that William Hurt got an Oscar nomination for barely 10 minutes in this movie is absolutely ludicrous. I cannot even talk about his performance because he was hardly in the movie. Ed Harris who I respect very much as an actor gave a regular, stereotypical portrayal of a gangster which wasn't to satisfying. Viggo Mortensen played average, he was not good or bad, he was just there.The cinematography wasn't even there and the moments it was, it was easy to see what was coming next. The music added to this as well with a very simple soundtrack that was also just there to fill the void.Lastly the writing was not good enough to get an Oscar nomination. All it had was a simple dialog and stereotypical small town life. Very disappointing in every aspect. I would not recommend this film.",A History of Violence

All the reviews and all the trailers had made me incredibly interested in what seemed like a truly original movie. Finally I got to sit down and watch it on DVD... and I found it to be a little below my expectations, but they were set very high.The film tells the story of Tom Stall (played by Viggo Mortensen), a small-town family man who runs his own diner and maintains a normal life. However, when two thugs come into the diner one night to rob the place, Tom proves a natural killer and saves the day. This small town hero becomes a national hero, and the attention and press bring some unwelcome visitors.Carl Foggarty (played by Ed Harris) arrives claiming to know Tom as Joey... a killer from Philadelphia with extensive ties to the mob. Little by little, Foggarty's presence makes Tom and his wife Edie (played by Maria Bello) unsure of who they really are.I won't spoil the rest because for anyone who sees the movie and doesn't know the twists... it'll be all the more enjoyable. For me, I knew all the twists and still found this to be a tightly wound drama that is thought provoking without being preachy. It manages to be a mainstream film while not losing an independent edge. It does so by being as polished and well-produced as any mainstream film of this past year... but it maintains a more bold, defiant, yet sensitive voice.David Cronenberg crafts a taught package here... and he gets some great work out of his cast. Ironically, the one ensemble member most snubbed around awards season this year is the first cast member I would nominate... Viggo Mortensen. Every layer of Tom Stall is there in his eyes, and if ever there was a multi-layered character Tom Stall is one of the more complicated ones. Sadly, Mortensen is the only cast member to seemingly make it through awards season completely unnoticed.The supporting cast is strong as well, particularly Ed Harris as Foggarty for me. He had a brooding and threatening presence mixed in with a lackadaisical wit that made him all the more threatening. Ironically, Maria Bello and William Hurt (the most widely awarded members of the ensemble) didn't impact me as strongly as others. I thought both offered very good performances, but personally I don't find Maria Bello's Oscar Snub ""unjustifiable"" and William Hurt's nomination was kind of pushing it in my eyes.A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE had many elements I liked very much... but there were moments when the voice dubbing was noticeably off and also moments where I really feel that sharpened editing and better underscoring would greatly help the film. These mis-steps don't make A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE a bad film by any means... it's actually a great film. However, it never quite met my incredibly high expectations.... B+ ...",A History of Violence
252,malcp,Graphic Novel in film shock horror outrage,3,17 April 2012,"I'm glad it mentioned that the story was based on a graphic novel at the start of the film because otherwise I'd have had very serious concerns about the motivation of the people who sponsored it's production. The only motivation is to make money and exploit the current range of popular graphic novel based films. The violence in this film is almost comic-book, but filmed just a bit too lovingly and too realistically to be mistaken for that, no Hammer-horror Kensington gore here, the director is looking for something else. Art? Who knows. The story is intriguing but ultimately wafer thin and again without a pre-warning that it was based on a graphic novel and superb acting throughout would have been completely laughable. What does this film aim to do? It takes what must have been a fairly interesting graphic novel (I haven't read it but it must have been good enough to attract some attention) and converts it's story into live action. In doing so it fails as a dramatic work because the story and characters aren't strong enough without the subtlety of the original medium. It fails as a film because the story and in particular the ending is painfully weak and my only thought is that not every graphic novel, toy or comic book is strong enough or can provide enough dynamic material to make an interesting film. Avoid this and watch Sin City or The Dark Knight.",A History of Violence
253,FilmFan777,"Extremely Disappointing, Much out of Place",4,1 October 2005,"Yes, these comments will contain some spoilers...I just have to vent. Since you know what the story is about, I wont waste that time yet I have to vent about a few things.I'm 'amazed' at the positive reviews this film is getting. I appreciate all kinds of films and can come away liking something for one reason or another 'HOWEVER' there was far more about this film that 'irritated' and agitated than pleased.Violence: Yes there is some violence in here and I thought it was some what believable. However the gore of it (though I liked the difference of it), seemed out of place with this film. As if someone from a horror film splashed some Freddy over a drama.Gratuitous is the one word that keeps coming up. I don't mind sex scenes in the least HOWEVER, it has to fit the glove and the sex in this film didn't do that. The first sex scene in the bedroom was so uncomfortably shot, corny at best and simply out of place. Almost like they were shooting a cheap porn instead of building part of the story.The scene on the stairs... there was something interesting in the content of it however it screamed again, corny and out of place and over the top.Speaking again of gratuitous, what was the purpose of having Bello walk out of the bathroom with her robe open? Not only did it not match the mood of what was going on, it totally takes you away from the issue at hand. It detracts from the story, not supports it. If they'd put it in one of the sex scenes, maybe they'd get away with it however here, they just dummified it. Threw it out there to show this actor doesn't shave, I mean come on. A story is something to build on. In many parts of this film they seemed to take away from building and throw something in that just took you away from it all. Simply not the point.Photography: You shouldn't be distracted by the photography. It should embellish. Here, I noticed times where it seemed they used an odd lens that just didn't seem to make sense. Enough that it 'actually' makes you notice. And this was done several times. Almost like they were experimenting or simply again, throwing something different on the wall to see if it stuck. And this is not the kind of thing you guess with.Casting: The school bully? He irritated me from the moment he showed on film. He was sooo typical! I mean come on. The casting and director and writer couldn't make him a 'lil' more original? Pretty boy tough guy acts like a jerk and pushes the tough dad's wimpy boy around til wimpy boy turns to superman like his dad Jacki Chan-ning two or more guys at once. Plleeeeaaase.Casting: The son of Viggo's character seemed like he was also plucked from a completely different film or teen wanna be TV show and slopped into this film as was Ed Harris and others.Another out of place moment: When Viggo meets his brother at his house, whats with the elongated seemingly homosexual greeting there? I mean, it could lead you to believe his brother used to molest him, that his brother is gay, that the two brothers used to be lovers and one went to the straight life.... Hey I'm Italian and our family is very affectionate yet if uncle Joey greeted me like that, it's Twilight Zone and shower time. Just another example of something being sooo out of place with this film.The Writing: There was some real corn popped into this script. Yet with the director doing all he could to disrupt your viewing pleasure, it almost seems a waste to go into it.Director Croneberg did some cool work with The Fly, Dead Zone and Scanners however that was loooong early 80's past and I've noticed nothing of him till now. And not something I'd be proud of.Overall... I cant believe all the positive reviews for this film. Viggo, Harris, Bello, Hurt all actors I enjoy. The idea of the film I like, some of the violence, certain aspects of which I liked and others turned off by. Yet I was not Thrilled by this predictable film in any capacity.

I knocked off 3 points on my vote because they went way too far with the sex and violence. I'm 56 and SWMBO is 48; at one point, SWMBO whispered to me, ""This is R-rated? I don't even think *we're* old enough to see this!"". And frankly, I'm tired of the blood-and-gore-all-over-the-floor (and the walls and the ceiling and the people) school of movie-making. One can show extreme violence without being gross about it.Having said that, I will give big credit in one aspect: the fight scenes are very realistic. This is the way martial arts is supposed to be used in self-defense. No flashy jump kicks to the head, no reaching down the throat and ripping the heart out, just very precise, powerful techniques that disable an opponent quickly and thoroughly.

255,mockturtle,The Master Returns,9,23 September 2005,"A true craftsman, David Cronenberg is in grave danger of becoming the greatest living filmmaker. His consistency, economy and mastery of tone, theme and pacing have made his last two features (""A History of Violence"" and ""Spider"") among the most adept, intimate and terse statements to come from any one director during that time (at least until we see how David Lynch's next film ""Inland Empire"" fares). This film works on many levels as a simple story and as a grand parable. All the actors serve the story, even in the flashiest roles (William Hurt is in fine form). The casting is remarkable: Stephen McHattie? Somebody cast this guy as Lance Henriksen's brother, quick! Some of the things that seem out of place at first fall into place as the different layers of the film are peeled away. For example: the son is improbably ripped for a dweeb, and has been provided with an improbably attractive fellow outcast. At first this seems like Cronenberg is doing the ""O.C."" thing, but it fits so well into the overall Hollywoodization of the small town that it makes sense as a chosen unreality, complete with blonde girl child-actor moppet. This will hopefully go a little of the way towards explaining why some of the characters are caricatures and why some of the situations seem like they are recycled from other movies: they are intentionally. Watch ""Out of the Past"" or ""The Killers."" That is not to lessen this film by comparison, because Cronenberg has accomplished the equivalent of how in ""Spider"" he brought us inside Spider's mind without any special camera tricks. In this film we watch a Hollywoodized fiction drained of its ketchup-fake blood until it runs dry and the family, through their trial by fire, pass through the lookingglass into the real world, the same way a real person does when the violence enjoyed by them on the big screen enters their real lives. Audience members gasped repeatedly at the results shots following the violence: they had their cake and Dave made them eat it too. The shots of the recently dead echo the scenes in Werewolf or Vampire movies when you see the monster turn back into a human after its death.Film can also be seen as a ghost story: imagine that when Ed Harris first calls him Joey Cusack...what if when he says he isn't Joey Cusack he is telling the truth? That Joey is almost an evil spirit that repossesses him. And that's why he doesn't change back into Joey's clothes when he goes back to Philly, because he's being possessed. Just an idea. My favorite thing about this movie is when people think they're the only one to come up with the idea that it has multiple layers, and you can hear them patting themselves on the back: ""it's almost like a metaphor for the country..."" no, really?The other knuckle sandwich is for people that think it is just a graphic novel adaptation. Cronenberg never read the graphic novel and didn't even know it was one at first.Viggo Mortensen. Without anyone really noticing it, Viggo Mortensen has created himself a theme; a theme that culminates with this film, a film that he probably would have landed even without ""Lord of the Rings"" in his back catalogue. Look at his filmography: Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III; Young Guns II; The Reflecting Skin; The Indian Runner; Boiling Point; Carlito's Way; Albino Alligator; the two Hitchcock remakes. All of these movies (even the bad ones) have to do with the mythologizing of violence in America and/or its consequences. His Quebecois secret agent in ""Albino Alligator"" capable of unforeseen violence, in ""Reflecting Skin"" there are mysterious 1950's youths in a black car that pick people up and drop them off dead. Mortensen really is becoming our Charles Bronson, whose son he memorably played in ""The Indian Runner,"" another film where he is a violent younger brother (despite William Hurt's excellent turn, and interesting facial hair configuration, I still wish David Morse were brought in to solidify that parallel). ""A History of Violence"" could be seen as his thesis film. If you check his trivia on IMDb you'll see that ""Viggo"" basically means ""warrior,"" appropriate.As for the rest of the principal cast: Ed Harris underplays!!! And he's an underling, he didn't insist on playing the big boss guy! He lets Hurt bring the ham, and for that I salute him.Maria Bello is all of the adjectives repeatedly used to describe her: earthy, sexy, realistic, and thoroughly convincing.The spine of this film is the love between the man and his wife; that is what lifts it above parable, fable, exercise, it is what gives it an emotional core and makes it ultimately affecting.Not that I'd complain if he made another venereal horror movie.And to Cronenberg: thanks for the shout-out to Genny Cream Ale in the bottle, if you think it's tough to find it that way try to get it on tap, there are only 3 bars I know of that have it that way.",A History of Violence

Aston Holmes who plays his son, Jack, is another one that really needed a grocery bag over his head.Aside from that, the story was very well done.Tom Stall is just an easy-going guy running a restaurant in a mid-sized town. He's got a pretty wife, a son, and a cute little daughter and the family is happy. Tom's got the American dream going for him.Then one day two punks show up and decide to rob the restaurant. Faster than you can say Jack Robinson, Tom has leaped over the counter and saved the day! Not only is Tom a local hero, but the media latches onto the story and it spreads far and wide.This incident is about to change Tom and his family's life forever. Especially when Carl Fogarty (played brilliantly by Ed Harris), and his goons, show up. It's obvious these bad boys are Mafia.What do they want with Tom Stalls? Well, it seems Fogarty is convinced Stalls is really Joey Cusack, a man who almost put his eye out years ago and was a member of the Mafia.The twists and turns this takes, due to Fogarty showing up, leads to some hard action in the film.If you find violence isn't your cuppa tea then you might want to re-consider watching this film (although the violence is no worse than most in today's films), but there are some bloody battles.The ending was rather strange, I thought, the people just sitting there, no one saying a word.

Until two vicious thugs rob the place and Viggo displays too much tactical know-how in taking them out single handed, becoming a media hero and bringing attention to well there's the plot of this searing, melodramatic tale of a man who might not be what he appears.Maria Bello, as his beautiful wife, remains in a blissful, dazed denial about her husband's true identity, until bigger fish Ed Harris and his formidable goons move in to take Viggo out since he was once, in their opinion, a successful hit man. After all, how could an average Joe be that good with a gun? While EASTERN PROMISES director David Cronenberg sets a nice platform of slowburn suspense, reminiscent of exterior, woodsy Film Noirs like HIGH SIERRA, the good stuff i.e. our hero becoming an antihero takes too long to get happen and once it does with the 11th hour introduction of a mob boss played by a completely miscast William Hurt it's too little, too late. Although Viggo Mortensen, displaying an old school tough guy countenance (think early 70's Charles Bronson) does play the part well – there's simply not enough for his true self to fight for, or against.Based on a graphic novel, this needed to be more... enjoyably violent. But the main problem is the script, so full of ponderous clichés and drawn-out, uninteresting bouts of dialog with brooding characters talking and talking about things almost happening, or just about to happen, yet nothing really ever does.For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com",A History of Violence
258,gluba2000,Did I See A Different Movie?,1,30 September 2005,"With all of the rave reviews for A History Of Violence I was expecting something great.I'm wondering did I see a different movie? I thought this movie was so filled with clichés and was very predictable at times.I honestly didn't like it one bit.The movie started off by setting up for the audience that Tom Stall is an ""all American"" guy by commenting to diner patrons that he'll ""see them at church on Sunday"" and by having a nice demeanor/way to himself.Some guys come in, wanna rob the place and kill them all. Tom acts in self defense, kills both of the guys. Now he's a town hero.Some suspicious looking guys come by and call him Joey. Then his wife gets suspicious and she finds out about his former life as Joey, a member of the mob in Philly. When she does she storms into the house mad at Tom/Joey, he grabs her, they have sex on the stairs, after they're done she fumes off upstairs.Then later on some guys come by wanting Tom/Joey to come back with them to Philly, an argument ensues, gun shots are fired, the wife screams at the windows and the daughter asks her calmly ""is everything OK, Mommy?"" like she didn't just hear the gun shots! The movie was just so filled with clichés. The worst of all the clichés was the son being the typical nerd with the ""different"" friend (we're supposed to assume that by her hair) the cliché tough jock (with the team jacket and all!) who gangs up on him with his friends.The subplot was boring, pointless, and above all (once again,) cliché.The acting I didn't find all that spectacular either (didn't the main actor win an award for his acting in this at the 2005 Cannes film Festival or something?) I thought the actress who played the young daughter's acting was so stale and bad.I say DON'T waste your money on this if you're listening to the rave reviews.

260,padiyark,More complex than its source,9,26 October 2005,"I had the pleasure of reading the graphic novel before watching the film, which is a rarity for me. The graphic novel is a relatively straightforward novel about the main character's history of violence. Director David Cronenberg, however, is more complicated than this novel, as we have seen in his films like ""The Fly"", ""Dead Ringers"" and even ""Crash"". In Cronenberg's hands, the novel is transformed into an essay on violence and how it starts to interweave within society. Don't expect all-out action from this film, which is why I think some did not like it. My only reason not to give it a 10 were the 2 sex scenes. It's not that the scenes themselves were bad, but they really were unnecessary, and if anything, broke the continuity of the story. But judging from his past movies, Cronenberg has some issues with sex.Performances are top par for the most part. Viggo Mortenson, while superficially flat, does convey the dilemma and the agony of the character extremely well. Ed Harris portrays his menacing character with such ease, yet avoids the caricature that others may have made it be. Even Ashton Holmes as the son does a superb job in showing adolescent turmoil. But the biggest surprise was William Hurt. Hurt, while always a good actor, is usually pretty laid back in most characters he plays. In this, he puts those roles aside and gives one of his most enigmatic, yet capturing performances to date. As for Maria Bello, she's adequate as the wife, but apart from the last scene in the movie, did not leave a mark of remembrance.Great film overall. Just don't expect this to be an action film.",A History of Violence

The first thing most people have said was 'David Cronenberg'. An objective review of a film does not compare one to another nor does it base its who's in it or how it fits in with the others from that particular director. You judge it based on character development, plot, writing, screenplay, pace, timing, genre, photography, locations, lighting, visual effects, the score, acting, direction, etc. and so on.I have seen quite a few movies, and sad to say haven't rated in awhile, but the fact that the rating was so high and people ranted and raved about this movie astounded me. So I thought I'd throw in my 2 cents for what it's worth.The character development was minimal at best. There was no development--all was simply mentioned in some vague reference to Tom (Viggo Mortenson)'s past. So what, he went into the desert, shed his skin, and became a new person? Doesn't work that way, especially when you're a cold-blooded killer. I understood Edie a little better--her love for her husband, her fear for her family, and her anger and turmoil at being lied to and unknowingly put in danger, and learning she never truly knew her husband. The son was poorly written. Sure, he may very well snap after a bully has been toying with him for a year, but he wouldn't just start kicking the crap out of everyone and cussing like he's a tough guy. Up until that point, he was played as a sensitive, quiet loner type who used his head instead of his fists. That was a cheap way to play the whole 'he's his father's son' crap. Very poorly written. The ending scene where he had to do what he did to save his father is much more believable. The daughter is just there--no development at all. After the first scene with Tom and Edie, I did not relate to these characters at all. I didn't feel like they were real--I didn't care about them.I just cannot fathom how a movie with Viggo Mortenson, Maria Bello, Ed Harris, and William Hurt could be so poorly written and underdeveloped. The fighting was horribly choreographed--every last punch looked fake--I was laughing at it. It reminded me of the old westerns I used to watch.The plot was pretty much nonexistent and what WAS there was repetitive. How many mobsters does a guy have to kill to live in peace? Couldn't they come up with anything better? I lost interest when Ed Harris' character started stalking them. He was so brazen and stupid about the whole thing, I did not believe it--it was so incredulous. The movie lost its momentum after his character was killed.There wasn't much of a score to speak of. The photography was okay. Locations were in tone with the movie, but nothing more. All-in-all, pretty unimpressive and oblique.An action movie has never felt so much like a drama to me. Other than killing a few mobsters every week or so, what action was there? There was no suspense in the stalking because it was so unbelievable. The story could never hold my attention for more than 5 minutes. And gore? Are you kidding?! I've seen more gore in Tales From The Crypt!!As far as acting goes, not impressed. I actually think the best performance was by Maria Bello. Viggo can do so much more--we all know that, but perhaps the blame lies with the director. Not impressed. Not at all. Nothing special, nothing remarkable. I'm trying to figure out if I saw the same movie as most everyone else who reviewed.THE FINAL VERDICT: The only reason why I'm not irritated at wasting time out of my life to watch this is because a) it was only an hour and a half, and b) I have a movie pass, so I don't lose money seeing it. Recommended only if you have absolutely nothing else to do and have seen pretty much everything else on the new release wall, or possibly if you're a fan of the director, but other than that, Running Scared (2006) with Paul Walker would be more worth your time.4.0 out of 10.0",A History of Violence

263,bulleetz37235,Kick ass entertainment,9,6 March 2006,"A film of supremacy.David Cronenberg's latest film is a blockbuster of all proportions. It involves a bunch of themes that a sick guy like him would take advantage of with pride. And he does.Viggo Mortenson stars as Tom Stall. A quiet man in American suburbia who owns a profitable diner, and has a blooming family.But then one day, he is confronted by a couple of store robbers who insist on inflicting as much punishment as they can whilst doing it. But Tom Stall isn't about to let his friends get hurt, he leaps into action, saving the day in a profoundly brutal manner.As a result the media circus begins, shining light on Tom as a modern day American hero. As quaint as it all seems, this triggers off the rest of the story.In comes Ed Harris, as the mysterious and scary Mr Fogaty (sp.) a Pillie man who insists that Tom is an old 'friend' back from Philadelphia, and that he must come home.Tom however contests his identity. He isn't Joey, he is Tom... But as the film plunders on, it seems that his battle against these mob-men is getting quite heated, as they stalk his house and family.Eventually comes the showdown between the lot of them. As the mob move in, taking Tom's son, and insisting he comes 'for a ride.' Once again, it's brutal action again. As Tom slays these men right in front of his family - not without a little assistance from his son Jack, at the last moment.Jack, being quite a key character as he throughout the film, enjoys violence as well. As he beats up his school adversary, and also blows Mr. Fogaty away. This shows a 'running in the family' kind of thing. And illustrates violence as being, only for those brought up with it.The final confrontation between Tom/Joey and his old past becomes apparent in the final quarter as he travels 'home' to meet his brother, and settle things once and for all.--- With a great moving story, which is both slow and fast paced it incorporates it's themes of violence, redemption, father-son bonding, brotherly love/hate, family, love and most of all the past inflicting the future making for a hell of an intelligent and deep picture.With a strong cast including already mentioned Mortenson and Harris, but also Maria Bello as Tom's wife, and William Hurt as his long lost elder brother. The talent on show is great, and I love how this film, is always teetering on the edge of being surreal and ridiculous, but always a little realistic.With amazingly gory special effects to boot, this film would be offended if it was called anything but great. Because it is, and I highly recommend you see it.",A History of Violence
264,pookey56,reinvention,10,5 October 2005,"when i first started watching David Cronenberg's films, it was hard to miss his gift as a director, but i thought he was somewhat, well, psycho, twisted. somehow he made arm-pit vampires sexy, had babies killing with big ball-bearings (divorce therapy), made ground-breaking films with exploding heads and guns fused on to people's hands, groups of people getting off on car crashes, twisted twins, cockroach typewriters, science gone so terribly wrong (bzzz);i mean, Cronenberg is out there. i have a lot of respect for Mr Cronenberg as a director, largely because he is a risk taker. A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE could be his best film to date. it forced me to go for coffee and cheese cake after watching it, because this is a film that needed discussing. it stays with you. for me it asked two very compelling questions: is there such a thing as redemption? i sure hope so or we are all damned. and if there is, what price do we pay? the other question it provoked was, can we ever escape our past? can we truly re-invent ourselves, and if we do, at what cost? i noticed a few shots of the rear-view mirror in the cars reflecting what was behind them, as if to say that what is behind us is still there following us. i particularly liked the short but impressive scene with Ashton Holmes and a jealous classmate. unpredictably, it showed how words could win over violence. basically a pacifist, as we are led to believe he was raised, he becomes drawn in to a violent world. he is an all American boy, who killed someone as a direct result of his father's past. But he also lost his temper and beat up a class mate, showing us that sometimes the nut doesn't fall far from the tree. there is hypocrisy in this film, tied to honesty, a measure of redemption, sacrifice, and yeah, violence. a remarkable film that avoided so many clichés and formulaic plot, it reminded me of the short story by Aldous Huxley called UTOPIA; great performance by William Hurt; it was so satisfying watching him as the actor who won the academy award so long ago. he provided the most satisfying, blackly humorous, brief yet memorable scene since Beatrice Straight in Network; and Ed Harris, an almost charming ghoul in contrast to that sociopathic mercenary we saw in UNDER FIRE, Viggo Mortenson, who never disappoints, and Maria Bello reflecting all those conflicting emotions. there was humor in it too, dispensed in a way that is all Cronenberg.i enjoyed that scene with the two teens wondering what people their age did for fun on a Saturday night one hundred years ago. and no neat ending. his young daughter sets a plate for her ""daddy"", but as young as she was she wasn't as innocent as we might expect. she couldn't help but feel the tension in the room; that everything had changed. but he was still her loving father, the dad who chased the ghosts away in the dead of night. having said all of this, i admit that my favorite scene was that shot of Aragorn's ass. sweet. a truly terrific film. and ya; i saw his ""tail"".",A History of Violence

If it wasn't for William Hirt and his cameo appearance as Vigo's troublesome brother I would have left long before. This has got to be a very big disappointment for Vigo fans. He has shown such great promise and talent. What did I enjoy about this flick?.....The actor who played ""The Bully."" Didn't catch his name but we'll be seeing him again soon I'm sure. Oh!! There was one other thing that I positively have to say was well portrayed in this inept movie.....The passionate love scene with Maria Bello definitely was a highlite not to mention her quick 3 second walk thru semi-nude. I sure hope she was paid top dollar for that. She is one very attractive gal.

266,Supachewy,"Not Cronenberg's Best, But Still Worth a Watch",6,20 November 2010,"The crime thriller A History of Violence is directed by David Cronenberg and stars Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello, Ed Harris, and William Hurt. The film takes place in modern day Millbrook, Indiana.Tom Stall (Mortensen) is the average man. He works long hours at his diner, he has a wife (Bello) and two kids, a son and a daughter. The family goes through all the usual problems such as how Tom's teenage son must face a bully at school which is actually somewhat a metaphor for the real story and Tom is friends with everyone in the small town because of his diner. But when one night two men attempt a robbery in his diner he uses amazing skills to kill the two men who threaten the lives of the customers and himself. Tom becomes a local hero and is on the news all over the country, even in Philadelphia where a man involved in organized crime believes that he knows Tom Stall as Joey Cusack. Can Tom protect his family from these men, or is he actually who they say he is? The script for this film was written by Josh Olson, and was based off the graphic novel. Even though it is critically acclaimed I was not a fan. I just never felt a connection to any of the characters of this film, I was only able to watch it and not able to absorb it. I understand the parallels between the son's problems and Tom's problems and that is clever but it did not make me enjoy the film. This film could have been much more exciting and not as corny because the whole thing felt fake, and I know that those of you who have seen it are saying well it's supposed to feel fake because of the way the film turns out but it felt too fake. It just wasn't a very enjoyable film for me even though the way everything played out was very logical. I know it was nominated for an Oscar, but it just didn't work for me.David Cronenberg is considered one of the best directors and he shows his talent in this film. The opening shot of the film was very impressive and he immediately lets the viewer know that he knows what he's doing when he's behind the camera. The shot that I am talking about is the shot that lasts about a minute or more with the two men who will rob the diner later in the film and it follows them into their car and to the two people that are killed in a motel. The rawness that is used towards the middle of the film with Tom Stall and his wife getting into some intimate action on the stair case and then later when she walks into the bedroom completely naked shows the dramatic change that the story has taken. Cronenberg has had a great career so far and even though I'm not a big fan of this film I am a fan of his direction of it and I can't wait to see what his next film will be.The acting in this is impressive for the most part but there were a couple of performances that bothered me. Viggo Mortensen plays the lead and he does a fine job, but not as great as he does in Cronenberg's Eastern Promises. He plays the part of the average man perfectly well, but he does not really bring me into the film. I don't really think he could have done much more with the role though it is really the way the writing was set up. Maria Bello did not give a great performance, she just kept on her angry face and yelled at Viggo the whole time. Her character was fake in the film in a way but her performance felt acted out, while a great actor does not seem like they are acting, they seem like they are themselves. Ed Harris did a great job in this film being the man with the organized crime connections who came to town. He was very creepy and memorable, and will definitely make you happy not to be in Tom Stall's shoes. William Hurt was nominated for an Oscar for his role, and he deserved the nomination due to his comedic style of playing a big mafia guy. Every single line he delivered perfectly and proves with this film that he is still a great actor. The performance by Ashton Holmes made it very hard for me to try and enjoy this film because of how poor an actor he is. He plays the part of the son and he is just terrible in every way, in how the delivers his lines, his facial expressions, just awful.Overall I give this film a 6/10. I know a lot of my review sounded very negative for this film but if anyone enjoys the crime drama I advise you to watch because of its critical acclaim. It was just not for me but you may love it, so give it a chance. I'm looking forward to Cronenberg's next film A Dangerous Method which will also have Viggo Mortensen as the lead.",A History of Violence
267,citizenchris,Subversive Masterpiece,8,18 October 2005,"""A History of Violence"" Let me get this out of the way...I loved AHOV. Here we have a film that tricks you into thinking its something like a premium cable original movie. It appears on the surface like that typical thriller/drama you've seen a million times. Though just beneath the surface lies a cunning subversive element ready to jump out and attack you. Very much like its protagonist Tom Stall (played by the masterful Vigo Mortensen) isn't the simple family man he appears to be neither is the film all that simple. The film seems to be concerned with an examination of the necessity of violence in our society and whether we can subdue the primal urge towards violence in order to exist in this society of ours. To me the film illustrates its point extremely well. Juxtaposing the violence of the so-called ""bad men"" in the (wonderfully shot) opening scene to the violent acts committed later in the film by the ""good"" Tom Stall. By the time the credits roll I was left feeling just as uncertain as I could imagine the characters were feeling....thats a neat trick if you ask me.",A History of Violence
268,LadyLiberty,A History of Violence less than the sum of its pieces,5,2 October 2005,"I went to see A History of Violence after reading a stellar review of the film and the level of acting in it in People magazine. Given that People's critic hates far more movies than she, I figured it was worth a look. A History of Violence, however, turned into a sort of mixed movie bag, at least for me.The film opens with a pair of men bizarrely lackadaisical men checking out of a small town motel. What they leave behind them when they go, however, serves in the strongest possible terms to prove that the pair aren't so much calm as they are sociopathic. As the pair wend their way through the Midwest, the scene changes to that of a small town diner in Indiana where owner Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) serves up a great cup of coffee and typical small town conversation and camaraderie.Tom and his lawyer wife, Edie (Maria Bello) live just outside of town in an old farm house with their two children, Jack (Ashton Holmes) and Sarah (Heidi Hayes). Their marriage is a good one; their teenaged son has some trouble in school with a bully, but it's nothing beyond what you'd see in countless small town high schools across the country. In short, the family is entirely ordinary in just about every way. But then the traveling men show up in Tom's diner and threaten him and his patrons. Seeing a momentary opening in the tense situation, Tom takes action and suddenly finds himself a local hero with his praises sung and his face broadcast in newscasts across the area.Tom modestly shrugs off all of the attention and says he just wants to go back to his quiet life; his wife, though proud of him, agrees. But as the reporters finally leave, three men in a shiny black car show up, complete with a menacing aura and unbelievable claims. Carl Fogerty (Ed Harris) is one of those men. Horribly scarred and with only one good eye, the soft-spoken Fogerty approaches Tom as if he knows him. Calling him ""Joey,"" Fogerty tells Tom that he just wants to talk about Philadelphia and something that happened there in the past.Tom tries not to offend the man even as he just wants him to go away. But even his wife begins to wonder what's going on when she reflects on just how handily her husband disarmed the men who tried to rob his diner, and her fears of the men who seem to follow her and her family everywhere only make her doubts all the greater. While Tom struggles to preserve his quiet life and to protect his family, more and more secrets come to be revealed and even he begins to wonder just how all he knows and loves will survive.His personal politics aside, I love Viggo Mortensen. I can't imagine another man in his role in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and I thought his portrayal of Frank Hopkins in Hidalgo was spot on. As Tom Stall, Mortensen is also very good. Despite a restrained demeanor, he somehow conveys a panicked struggle just below the surface of his character that gives reality and dimension to the performance. Maria Bello is all right though she has little to do but be angry or afraid. Ed Harris is, as always, just brilliant; William Hurt, though limited by a small role, is terrific. Ashton Holmes, who is making his movie debut in A History of Violence, does himself proud as a boy who must face his demons even as his father is facing some of his own.The story told by A History of Violence is compelling to say the least (it's based on the graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke) The real shortcomings of A History of Violence lie in the script that conveys that story. The movie moves very slowly at times as it works to establish the very ordinariness of characters who are about to have their mostly uninteresting (except to them, of course) lives turned upside down. While I appreciate that the writer is drawing some contrast between now and later for us by doing so, the time spent was just too long and as a result there were substantial stretches of time when the movie dragged. It also appeared that, while the graphic violence in the film was shown with real purpose, one of two relatively graphic sex scenes was entirely gratuitous and as such was more an interruption than anything else.A History of Violence is a relatively short movie clocking in at just over 90 minutes. It seemed much longer than that. When a movie is billed as a psychological thriller (and it could have been), it should have been over before we knew it. It wasn't. I saw the film with a friend and her kids. When the lights came up at the end of the show, her 19 year-old said, ""That is the worst movie I have ever seen."" No, it's not the worst. But it certainly could have been better and, in fact, deserved to be.FAMILY SUITABILITY: A History of Violence is rated R for ""strong brutal violence, graphic sexuality, nudity, language, and some drug use."" This is not a movie for children or for adults who are upset by blood and gore. Some death scenes are very graphic; the sex, too, is well beyond what younger viewers should see. A couple of the performances are well worth seeing for those who appreciate such things; if you're willing to endure the slow scenes (and there are too many), there is a substantial pay-off waiting for you as the movie progresses. The question, however, is whether or not you're willing to wait for it. I was; my friend and her kids were unequivocally not.",A History of Violence
269,Surecure,Best Picture of 2005,10,13 March 2006,"Let people talk about racial disparity in LA, or gay cowboys, or Israeli vengeance, or either of two media icons... the true best picture of 2005 was never nominated for the Oscar. Of course, as history (pardon the pun) goes, the Oscars rarely get it right.David Cronenberg has always been a director that sits on his own amongst all the celebrated directors of the modern era of film-making. His intelligent perception is more often than not misunderstood by average audiences and his unique view of the world is rarely a comforting one. A History of Violence is probably his most accessible film to date, though it does not pull its punches in doing what most Cronenberg films do: challenges one's beliefs.While the story itself is about a man who becomes a hero only to have the publicity attract criminals who believe he is somebody else, the real story is much different. While the audience and the characters are trying to determine the true identity of the protagonist, Tom Stahl -- played flawlessly by Viggo Mortenson -- the real story is how the protagonist himself is trying to determine who he really is, and it is this journey that unravels the entire life he has built.Cronenberg is nothing if not indirect in his explorations. He builds his compositions slowly, an almost unobservable crescendo that viewers only recognize when the sound becomes impossible to shut out. While the audience may be looking at a simple picture of a simple family in a simple town, Cronenberg is planting invisible pieces that build to a larger puzzle ultimately destroying the comfort zone all the serene images have built.In the case of A History of Violence, Cronenberg exposes the vulnerable nature of identity, both personal identity and public identity. As Tom Stahl is forced to reconcile who he is, so too are the members of his family forced to understand at a different level how their own personal identities are dependent upon each other. When one identity is drastically changed, so too do all the dependent identities change. And as Cronenberg shows through the rise in anger in Stahl's son and the altering of sexual energies with Stahl's wife, sometimes these changes can be completely unpredictable and difficult to cope with.Few films rise to the level of being a completely new focus on an age-old paradigm, but A History of Violence's deconstructionist take on the simple, small-town America is as refreshing as art as it is enlightening as social commentary on an inescapable aspect of human life: the role of violence (both physical and emotional) in personal identity. In this, Cronenberg has crafted a lens that exposes more than many might find comfortable in exploring, as this film is as much a commentary on all people as it is about any region. Add to this a brilliant script, a perfect cast, fantastic cinematography and a wonderful score and A History of Violence is as close to a perfect film as one can get.",A History of Violence

271,engelst,Bland work that may go into history as Cronenberg's worst,4,9 November 2005,"A History Of Violence needs only a few minutes to demonstrate a dogged and stubborn blandness, which unfortunately for any fan of Cronenberg, will not subside until the end.The story and what the director did with it belong in a medium level TV series, not a motion picture.The acting is of the same calibre. Mortensen is his usual colourless self, a puzzling choice for a part that is built up of explosive bursts of passion and violence. Noteworthy are Ashton Holmes and the ever impressive Ed Harris.I would put this film in the ""Alan Smithee"" category, as it is far far removed from the quality of earlier Cronenberg work such as The Fly or Dead Ringers.",A History of Violence
272,Quentintarantado,A fascinating contrast to the graphic novel,9,12 March 2006,"I saw the movie first, and I was impressed. Then I read the graphic novel, and the changes made in its journey on screen are very interesting.The script focused on Tom and his life now. There are no flashbacks to Tom as a young guy, and what he did to make gangsters want to find him. In the graphic novel, there is the supporting character of Richie, now transformed into Tom's brother. Richie's fate in the novel was conceptually horrifying, so much so that I guess it would take away from Tom's story.However, I wonder if Richie's story could have been incorporated anyway. It's a haunting idea, and I'm sure it's one of the reasons the graphic novel became memorable. It may have been why someone wanted to turn it into a movie.Ah, well, imponderables. Cronenberg decided to jettison the last cry of help in ""The Fly"" and he had his memorable ending instead. This ending, at the dinner table, is very, very good, and is more appropriate for what this movie has become, but this ending pales compared to what happened to Richie.Two more comments: I think it's an interesting choice that Ed Harris's character is killed by the son. It was the wife in the graphic novel. That decision is certainly an improvement because of the implications it raises.Lastly, in the novel, Tom is no killer. He was goaded by his friend Richie, but they had no prior experience, and only luck, youth and daring enabled them to succeed. Here, Tom had previous training, which is a kind of a cheat. I would like a TRUE everyman to confront violence, and suffer through the consequences. Realistically, an ordinary man would get blown away, but maybe luck, or an innate talent for violence, might enable him, never mind how slight that chance is, to survive. For that, I can't give this movie a 10 out of 10.Richie's story, and the idea that Tom is an ordinary guy and not a super killer, are the graphic novel's best facets.Among the movie's assets, it has Bello, Mortensen as well as everyone else's acting, Cronenberg's storytelling and the implication Tom's talent is transmittable through the genes. Oh, and that last dinner scene is exquisite, despite what I said about it. A quieter ending for a quieter version of the story.I guess I like both versions of the story, and I'm happy both exists.",A History of Violence
273,underfire35,A History Of Cronenberg..........,10,24 March 2006,"There are very few filmmakers that I trust. I count David Cronenberg amongst them, which is good because in his latest film, A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, it is required. On the surface the film seems to be fairly ordinary. The storyline is pretty much by the numbers, there are no great twists or revelations. To many, it may be an easy film to dismiss as just another violent action film. I suppose it helps to have a knowledge of Cronenberg's past films: SCANNERS, THE FLY, DEAD RINGERS, CRASH (not the recent Oscar winner), NAKED LUNCH, SPIDER. All these previous projects act as a kind of mission statement and give some insight to what Cronenberg is attempting to say with A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE. In this one film, he brings into play many of his past themes: violence, sex, death, identity, hidden lives, troubled interpersonal relationships, the decay of morality, the attempt to retain morality even after it has proved to be a chimera.Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) is a peaceful family man. He owns a small diner in a small town in Indiana. One day two men enter the diner intent on robbing Tom, when the smoke clears, nothing will be the same for him or his family again. Not soon after a slick mobster with one dead eye walks into the same diner claiming to know Tom, to have a dark connection to him. Stall's wife Edie (Maria Bello) believes that the strange man is mistaken, that there is no possible way that Tom could have ever known this person. She supports him fully, but even she falters in her own mind. Tom's son, Jack (Ashton Holmes), is in many ways effected by the events. A cycle has started; at one point, after a showdown with the mobsters, Tom looks at his son and it seems clear that it was only a matter of time before Jack would be born into violence. The events that follow shed light on the mystery and so I will stop here. The plot outline is deliberately brief; to give too much information away would be to undercut the effect of the film. A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE is Cronenberg's critique on the specifically American love of violence and death. Being a Canadian, he can view it with a certain closeness, but still be able to stand back and look at the whole picture. I think his observations are spot on. The focus, as the title suggests, is violence and in the film it is always sudden. It almost always is though. Whether unexpected like the Kennedy assassination or as inevitable as a beach front landing during WWII, there is always that one moment when force is applied to the human body resulting in injury or death. Once that happens, everything has changed. Like blood sprayed across one of Edward Hopper's more idyllic paintings, A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE both engages the audience in the gruesome acts, then repels them. In one scene where a character is shot in the top of the head, everything leading up to that point is choreographed in an ""action movie"" style. Where Cronenberg differs from many directors is that following the initial moment, there is a scene of the same man struggling to suck air through a mouth and jaw ruined by the exit wound. We, as the audience, have watched the thrill of the violence, but Cronenberg also makes us view the very real aftermath, he forces us to watch that character die.The performances are another thing that brings a certain edge to the story. Viggo Mortensen brings with him the heroic stature of the LORD OF THE RINGS films, something that Cronenberg then toys with. Maria Bello brings strength to Edie, but also vulnerability as she faces a situation, and inward desires, that she cannot understand. Bello is fastly becoming one of my favorite actresses, between this film, AUTO FOCUS, and Permanent MIDNIGHT she has become one of the more underrated female leads working today. Ed Harris is always great and here is no exception. He does quite a lot with the small part of the mobster in creating menace and backstory. The standout, however, would have to be William Hurt, who shows up in the third act and simply dominates the story. Again, with brief screen time, Hurt creates a wonderfully oily, posturing, and completely incompetent villain. It is one of the most organically strange characters in recent memory. It could be stated that both Harris and Hurt are over the top, becoming almost caricatures, but I believe that was the intent of Cronenberg. The contrast between Tom Stall and these looming figures is pointed. Much like the setting of peaceful rural Indiana serves well as a backdrop for moments of shocking brutality. The juxtaposition of the two extremes is what Cronenberg wants to emphasize.There is much first rate work behind the camera as well. The cinematography by Peter Suschitzky is understated though sharp, capturing all the nuances of Cronenberg's vision. Composer Howard Shore's music plays on the Americana of the setting, but slowly introduces darker undercurrents suggesting that all is not what it seems. The screenplay, adapted By Josh Olson from a graphic novel, while fairly mainstream in its construction, offers the perfect framework for Cronenberg's dark sensibilities. A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE seems to be a film that people with either ""get"" or dismiss. It is lumped together under the ""action/thriller"" category, but remains neither. It is instead a study of the elements that make up such a genre. Very rarely do action films deal with the consequences of violence, how it effects those whose lives that it touches. David Cronenberg has always been a challenging presence in film and A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE is no exception. His message is more subtle this time around, but that in no way lessens its impact. 10/10",A History of Violence

But there is no real...point.The first two thirds of this movie is good psychological build up with a clever use of tension between the characters due to a great cast. This however goes out the window in the last third with a sudden gore fest emerging and the movie inconsistently hovering between high drama and something that requires 30 galleons of red liquid.The movie's humour also falls flat as it doesn't straddle well between the drama and the funny parts. Cronenberg would have been well advised to look at Tarantino's work to see how it could be achieved.This movie ends up as a mess of genres with no real purpose or ending. A shame because the potential was very much there for something really special.",A History of Violence
275,Pierre_D,Excellent thriller with deep humanity,10,21 November 2005,"I came upon this movie accidentally, wanting to see the new Harry Potter but seeing it sold out, and this film had barely started. I convinced my best friend to see it, we sat down not quite knowing what to expect, and we were riveted throughout.From the opening sequences, this film is unflinching in its portrayal of violence and its consequences. We see how redemption sometimes comes at a cost as Tom Stall is in a 'podunk town' as a cafe owner, then finds his life shattered as he dispatches of two town-hopping criminals.It is at this point that the movie really picks up as Ed Harris arrives as Fogarty with his goons and delivers an incredibly commanding performance that stays with you longer than he does in the film.We then pan to the son having troubles with bullies and dismissing them at first with wit, then with his fists with unbridled aggression, showing what we are all capable of when pushed a little too far.Maria Bello is incredible as Edie, the pretty wife of someone she hardly, in the end, knows. Her reactions to her husband's revelations are real and hardly forced.As the movie develops, we see that Tom has to deal with his past, and this leads to delicious moments from William Hurt as his brother. Hurt clearly relishes his role and hams it up and adds some needed levity to the film's gritty tone.In the end, Tom returns home and his family accepts him back...but not without tears from his wife, still stung by his betrayal.There were not more than 20 people in the theater when we went, including us.

277,sullibrandon,A taut and tense emotional thriller,9,24 March 2006,"A History of Violence tells the story of Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) and what happens when he is forced to kill two people in defense of his small town diner and those within it. He is hailed as an American hero, and everyone admires him. Unfortunately, this brings him to the attention of a couple of people who claim to be old friends of his, including the brilliant Ed Harris.I saw this movie a couple of days ago, after it came out on DVD. I had heard all the critical praise about it, and was expecting a good movie. I was not disappointed.The characters are fleshed-out, full, and I instantly fell in love with every one of them. Viggo Mortensen plays the tortured Tom Small to perfection. How he is torn between the violence within him and the peace that he knows he must show his family is very well done. The range of emotions that play across Viggo's face throughout the movie are almost deserving of an Oscar. His wife, played by Maria Bello, is just right for the part. I could feel how she was at the same time horrified, and admiring, or the man that her husband became after he killed the two men who were going to kill him.This movie is also deeply disturbing. Aside from the moments of intense (and creative, I might add) gore, there is an underlying tension that runs the length of the movie, as we struggle along with Tom Small in trying to figure out who he is. It also puts into question a sort of tension that exists within all of us, as we struggle to find out who WE truly are.This movie, aside from being graphic in the gore sense, also contains two graphic sex scenes, and brief full frontal nudity. The sex scenes were intensely helpful to the plot, and served as a contrast between each other, with the innocent sex scene at the beginning and and the slightly twisted and rough sex scene an hour into the movie. The way they work in tandem is beautifully pulled off, although I thought they could have done without the full frontal nudity. It had the sense of just being tacked on there, and didn't really work with the scenes that came before, or after it. Mostly it seemed to be added for the purposes of titillating the audience, to illicit some kind of response, but it just fell emotionally flat and did not resonate or strike an emotional cord at all.The end of the movie was also well pulled off as well. I won't give it away, but how the filmmakers seemed to give a sense of closure, while at the same time not quite doing so, was very well done. I do not completely respect movies that give the audience everything they want in terms of closure. Movies that keep me guessing are some of my favorites.This brings me to what was wrong with the movie...why I am not giving it a 10/10. The violence, though the director claims was realistic, seemed a little extreme sometimes. There is a part where a man's jaw is hanging off of his face, by just a few tendons, and he's babbling in incoherent pain in a pool of his own blood. Other parts in the movie seemed enlarged in terms of blood, with more blood and more gore thrown in to excite the audience. I believe the movie would have benefited from a more realistic view of violence. I also found the movie a bit disappointing, in terms of the twist halfway through. I won't give that away either, but when it happened, I was like, ""What? Um...there's nothing else?"" Perhaps the simple way the twist worked was best, but for me it didn't quite meet the momentous build up.On the whole, History of Violence is well worth a rental. My quibbles with it are minor. The characters are good, the plot is fresh, the whole thing is just beautifully well done. I highly recommend it.",A History of Violence
278,jt1999,Ultimately pointless,4,22 September 2005,"This film is proof positive that classic filmmakers are in short supply -- and that David Cronenberg is a competent -- but not great -- director. In the hands of a Kubrick, Lynch or Hitchcock, this could have been an okay film. But the cliché-ridden script (""I want the truth!"") finally reveals itself not as a profound meditation on violence and human behavior, but a familiar story about a man returning to his violent past, done much better many times before by Fuller, Leone, Scorsese and Eastwood (""Unforgiven"" might be the best point of reference). A slow start, obvious happy-family setup so we can see the contrast later, flat performance by Viggo Mortenson and embarrassing, unnecessary sex scenes between Mortenson and Maria Bello don't help matters. Ed Harris steals the show as a frightening, scarred criminal, while William Hurt almost saves it as a strange, funny-scary east coast mobster. But the open ending and ""Sin City""-style over-the-top comic book third act turn what began as a realistic story into a pulpy, ""graphic novel"" (as comic books are now being referred to). Finally, ""A History of Violence"" is more a collection of potentially good ideas than a cohesive story -- yet critics will no doubt lavish heaps of praise on director Cronenberg. Why? Not for making a great film -- but for surprising everyone by making a film with neither flesh-eating viruses or exploding heads (everything seems better when you expect less). Meanwhile, a fantastic film (""King of the Ants"") by a director who actually seems to understand violence (Stuart Gordon) can't even get a theatrical release.C+",A History of Violence

It had an intriguing premise and pretty good cast (Viggo, Ed Harris, Maria Bello), but the plot leaves a lot to be desired. Without giving too much away here is it what made me the angriest:1. Vague reasons for Viggo being where and who he is. 2. People are killed in a major shoot out with no investigation by the state police or FBI  the only police presence is the town's moronic sheriff (who wears a STRAW hat!) 3. Bad guys that can't shot straight. 4. Stupid sub-plot with Viggo's son that borders on the ridiculous. I am sure that the OC or One Tree Hill (or whatever the current teen TV show is) has had a better plot than is allotted to this character's sub-plot. Come on; was it really necessary to waste time on the ""silent, sensitive"" type taking on the school bully? And they get into a fight at a softball game! 5. The girl that plays Viggo's daughter appears to have ridden the ""little"" bus to school before making this movie! 6. One strange scene that borders on justifying marital rape.Things that I like:1.

281,stodruza,"It is a good piece of entertainment, but fails to evoke any ideas or emotions that would make people reflect on their own inner qualities.",7,23 March 2006,"Before I went to see The History of Violence I thought this to myself: This film is going to goad the audience into liking it, and two: It won't have one tender scene in it. I was wrong about the first intuition: This film moves along because of the story, the events that unfold to hold our interest. But I was curiously right about my second premonition. The tender scene in the film where Tom makes love to beautiful Maria Bello is strictly used for set up for the bare plot to unfold, and not is in any way build on later with perhaps other tender scenes used to build up further Tom Stall's personal condition. Having convinced himself (I think) of the film's broader and important implications, this would not occur to Cronenberg, when in fact that's where the nuance and truth of the story lies.Watching this film made me feel alive, but so would a moderated dose of morphine. I enjoyed it, and it's a pretty good film. The main problem I think is one of expectations and overreaching, not in the film but in Cronenberg's media marketing campaign. The lip service is that A History of Violence raises important questions, but I challenge Cronenberg to seriously elaborate on each one, not in a sound bite which anyone can swallow but in an essay. ""How this film contributes to a historical debate on violence,"" or, better yet, ""The Macroscopic implications of the Concept or Concepts put forward in this film."" Don't tell us it's important when it is just entertainment with homestead justice as the main theme.This film works on a micro level for me intellectually and emotionally as much as it is about one man's, Tom Stall's, story of survival. America at large does not need a lesson of using force in order to right its past violent behavior, although it does need a lesson on not using violence every time it can in order to solve its problems. ""You're in so deep now, that you better know how to shoot your way out!"" Isn't that the central message of this film if there is one, as Cronenberg has suggested this film is loaded with layered textured meaning? Just tell me it's entertainment, and one man's story and I'll be fine, but don't bullshit everybody on the philosophical pretensions of this film. To me it's laughable.Also, the film wants to be something a little too much and this is evident in a few scenes where the dialog falls into cliché apparently because the screenwriter could not think of anything else to say, or didn't think to or feel that he needed to search another avenue of expression. It is a good piece of entertainment, but fails to evoke any ideas or emotions that would make people reflect on their own inner qualities. The guy had to do what he had to do. No matter how good and story driven the film is it leaves us short, whether we know it or not (and we don't in real time because the story that moves along is strong enough to hold our interest), it leaves us short of any lasting sustaining emotion, the kind of emotive forces that Paul Thomas Anderson has only begun to approach in his work. Also, it has in it covered up in a personal survival story of one man, a paucity of ideas for contemplation somehow inherent in the material. Some of Cronenberg's work to date is powerful to be sure, but this film really lacks an artist's sensibility. This is something interestingly that Cronenberg began to do in The Dead Zone, attempting and succeeding to some degree to flesh out Johnny's (Christopher Walken) character beyond the essential structure of the story.Along with Cronenberg's non-diagetic media efforts he is in an important sense pandering to the overall culture, refusing to explore deeper personal issues that make a man a man. Now he doesn't have to, if he kept quite and presented the film as a personal story. Many critics today would dismiss a less than perfect attempt at this, however, as it could and probably would be a trickier and harder film to make exceptionally well. I actually understand the impulse to include broader implications in his marketing campaign.What the History of violence does, finally, if you chose to look at its broader implications, and there is no reason why you should outside of Cronenberg's marketing efforts, is the reaffirming of the American Ideal once again: If you know how to kick some ass, you'll have a place at the table. Or, ""You gotta do what you gotta do."" You have to be bad to be good latter? In certain situations violence is sometimes necessary? This all sounds one dimensional to me. These are all interesting themes, but they are small themes, which have simple and correct answers. That's fine, and thanks for the entertaining film.",A History of Violence
282,Rogermex,Not what it was cracked up to be.,3,8 October 2005,"After perusing all sorts of positive reviews of this flick, I decided I'd better catch it. What a rip-off! This thing was certainly over-hyped, as if it were some sort of new achievement in drama, one of the year's best pictures, etc.The plot was preposterous - this owner of a hash joint is actually an ex-gangster who spent ""three years in the desert"" (what, like Jesus?) persuading himself he's a new person. Or so he tells his peculiar wife, whose idea of hot aggressive sex is to play-act cheerleader, everything but the pom-poms. Their adolescent son can't decide whether he should develop his skill at masochistically egging on a bully into rolling him, or to change in his school locker into a ninja costume and suddenly do whiplashing martial arts on the bully and sidekick. As for the little girl in the house - forget it, one of the worst child actors I've ever seen. Poor thing peroxided her hair for the role.Speaking of hair, what's with Viggo's quite weird do?

283,chanelit-1,A great film from a Master Director = not to be missed!,9,3 May 2006,"A very strong and powerful film dealing with themes that are relevant to all of us. A History of Violence is without a doubt, Cronenberg's most mainstream effort but is still imbued with his stylistic touches and a sense of hyper-realism in a world of fantasy.The film asks many questions and doesn't give as many answers, so as to make the audience work harder and to let the film linger just that but longer in the memory.With today's notions of religion, compassion and caring - a film that dissects the very nature of man's wild/animalistic side - the violence and lust of the film, couldn't be better timed.The violence in this movie is disturbing and the results are always unpleasantly gruesome, but never overstated. If anything, Cronenberg is holding back, deliberately, in certain scenes to maintain the truth of the violence as opposed to glorifying it. Make no mistake - there's plenty of blood in this film, but we are never drenched in it.The two scenes to me that propel this film into adult-only territory are the sex scenes which are incredibly graphic but again, there for a purpose and cutting in between the violence.In summary, this is a film you should watch. It's not horrifically violent or pornographic but does for the odd second here and there, flirt with both. For a purpose.

284,shattenjager777,A masterpiece,10,22 October 2005,"Now, first of all, do not go into the theater if you're offended by any amount of sex or violence. If any of that can offend you, this will, and you will probably be sorry, so just don't do it.Secondly, for those of you who want nothing but sex and violence will likewise be disappointed--there is plenty of violence, but it is all rather brief and the sex certainly isn't explicit to the point of being worthy of pornography if that's what you want. Now, on to the actual review.""A History of Violence"" is largely an exploration on the effects of violence, as we see two cold-blooded killers quickly killed by a nice guy restaurant owner and watch how it affects his family and then a major plot twist takes us on to see even more violence and again how it affects everyone. Director David Cronenberg and screenwriter Josh Olson craft a film that seems to show the entire possible range of reactions to violence and even shows us different reactions to different types of violence. The effects of Tom Stall's self-defense slayings range from increased violence in the case of Jack, his son, to anger at Tom in the case of his wife, Edie, to a seemingly fearful response from Tom himself. And later, when more violence ensues, the effects are again the visible portion, ranging from sexual arousal to a need for atonement (more specifics are impossible without spoilers--though there admittedly isn't much plot, it has major twists that need to be hidden).Necessarily, with so much focus being on the effects of violence, the acting is very important and in fact is extraordinary. Viggo Mortensen--another Cronenberg star fresh off of major action success (a la Peter Weller in ""Naked Lunch"" coming off of ""Robocop"")--may surprise many with how brilliantly he performs as he plays one of the deepest, most complex characters you're ever likely to see on film. He seemingly has to portray every possible emotion and does them all believably and with a wonderful restraint that fits the film perfectly. Maria Bello, meanwhile, also has a subtle, complex character and as usual performs brilliantly (Why do people always seem shocked that she's so good when she does it every time she's in a movie?), conveying all of the subtleties that her somewhat heavy-handedly metaphorical wardrobe skips. Ed Harris has a depressingly one-dimensional and rather dull character and thus does not have the opportunity to exercise his acting muscles, unfortunately, and William Hurt is much the same--though both are receiving great reviews, I think those have more to do with reputation than their performances, which are fine with what they have, but that's not much. Even Ashton Holmes performs quite well as Jack Stall, who is going to have to pay a lot of money to psychologists somewhere down the line after this much trauma.Cronenberg's film is, not surprisingly, full of low-key lighting and beautiful cinematography, but his camera is perhaps surprisingly quiet. It seems that he's just going to let us watch what's going on rather than trying to tell us anything and that choice of a sort of directorial restraint is often very effective, and especially so here. He and editor Ronald Sanders also give the film an almost disturbingly slow pace except for the violent scenes, which are almost music video-like in their quick cutting and constant action and seem even more so for their presence next to so much slowness. As usual, Howard Shore's score is middling--it works but it certainly isn't Bernard Herrman or Peter Gabriel level.All in all, this is a slow, disturbingly believable and excellent work showing the effects of violence. It's not for the squeamish or for the blood and guts crowd, really (hopefully Quentin Tarantino fans stay away--this is for those of us who weren't dumb enough to believe ""Pulp Fiction"" was an ""intelligent"" movie), but anyone who can handle it SHOULD watch it, because it is as brilliant a movie as I have ever seen, truly.",A History of Violence

Like most people I do not like to know the plot or, especially, the ending but I think most people coming into the movie without any prior knowledge would have a basic idea what the story is about and it seemed as if it would be the basic comic book story. Now don't get me wrong, I do like comic books especially the graphic novels but, like ""Sin City"", most target an audience which crave sex and violence. Despite the hype, ""Sin City"" was pretty poor and it seems as if this movie would be more of the same. But looks can be deceptive. There is sex and violence but what raises this movie above the ordinary is the story and the acting. Like all good movies it gets you thinking but without spoiling the plot by getting into to much detail there is a cause and effect for all the actions. The casting of the movie was also interesting. Viggo Mortensen is a very under-rated actor and this movie shows that he can still play ""Lord of the Rings"" but also superb characters like La-Ling out of ""Carleto's Way"".

286,TIALI,"Some people can change, some won't",8,1 October 2005,"This is about violence. HoV starts with 2 murderers who complain about the life and want to stop all the moving from town to town. But they only talk. Every chance they get to kill someone, the do it. They don't really want to quit. But Tom/Joey is different. He really abandoned his old violent life and raised a normal family. Tom is the stick by which is family is measured. His wife is loving, and his son is passive. But when Tom reveals that he's really Joey, he gives permission to his family to change: his wife transforms into something wild and his son explodes. Tom's web of violence spreads across his family: this is like a lesson in nature vs. nurture. Is violence learned or part of our genes? In this case it's both. We see that violence can be controlled through Tom, but we also see that once violence is seen as normal, it can infect others. Tom is able to escape his own violent tendencies, but he can't control others. He might be able to influence his family, but only as long as he can keep the outside world away. So the story takes us back to Tom's brother--his only other flesh and blood relative. Tom needs to break the bond with his violent genes, otherwise, how can he ever expect to nurture his family back to a peaceful existence? And when Tom returns home, he's unsure whether he's succeeded. So the one person who seems to be immune to the violence is Tom's daughter, who offers a solution to her family's problem. If you look at A History of Violence realistically, you'll notice a major flaw: you can't kill 2 serial killers and 3 mob guys without attracting Federal Law Enforcement attention. But in this movie, the only attention Tom/Joey attracts is from the local sheriff and one local news station. In the real world, his front yard would be filled reporters and police. (Unless no one knows about the 3 mob bodies--if they're hidden in the woods, then that would explain why no Feds show up to question Tom and possibly take his prints and discover who he really is.) But this movie isn't about that world. I gave this a high rating, but I'll admit that none of the images stay with me. This was a good story, and a movie worth seeing. But the style of the movie was pretty dispassionate. The violence was represented without much emotion. The scenes in the beginning and the final dinner scene had more emotion.

Late that night, at closing time, those same two killers enter the diner that Tom owns. They draw their weapons threatening him and the remaining customers in the diner. The usually mild-mannered family man, Tom, is forced to take drastic action and violently the situation is resolved. Tom is hailed as a hero by the town and the media. He just wants this all to die down, to return to normal, but that former innocence is gone. And now three men, led by the menacing and scarred Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris), skulk around town. They believe Tom is Joey Cusack from Philadelphia, someone who they have a beef with. This obviously creates turmoil in the family. The oldest son gets in trouble for fighting back at a bully.

Having said that, it is precisely that which has spurred me to write it now.I watched this movie last night and was, if anything, slightly disappointed. I was expecting to be blown away (no pun intended) but I never really was. I won't bore you all by rehashing the story, I'm sure you have an idea. There were just a few moments where the movie felt a bit laboured to me. I'm not sure what it was - the dialogue was pretty consistently good, the acting was superb, the pacing was great - but, when the movie finished, I just felt a little let down.Having dwelt on it overnight and thought about it this morning, I'm starting to feel different. While watching the movie, I felt underwhelmed by Viggo's performance but, at the end of the movie, I skipped the DVD back to about 15 minutes into the film and noticed the subtle yet profound difference in his performance of the character before and after all of the acts of violence he is forced to commit which force him into rediscovering his former self.I have since been thinking more and more about the idea of the subtle being the most powerful form of persuasion, and it is here that this film, with contemplation, really succeeds. There's something about the atmosphere at the end of the film, something totally unspoken, which says, ""things will never be the same"". It would have been the easiest thing in the world for Cronenberg to make a huge point of telling us this, but he doesn't. This is truly the hallmark of a director who knows exactly what he is doing and my respect for Cronenberg has skyrocketed. It was not an obvious choice for him to make this movie to begin with, as it is a much more ""commercial"" outing than anything he has ever done. Despite this, he has managed to lace it with an underlying intelligence that we hardly ever see in mainstream cinema.As for the supporting cast, Maria Bello really gets a chance to show her ability, and does so in a wholly convincing and engaging (if not entirely original) way. She is also absolutely gorgeous! Ed Harris does his thang in typical Ed Harris fashion, a little too close to his performance in A Beautiful Mind but sufficiently menacing nonetheless. William Hurt is hysterically funny without slipping into parody, which is a hugely difficult thing to do. He more than deserved his Oscar nomination. A nice surprise was Ashton Holmes' performance as the son of the family, who is facing his own dilemma in terms of dealing with his own use of violence. Besides looking a bit too old to be in High School (he must've been 25/26 during filming), he is absolutely perfect.The violence, as I'm sure the reader will know, is quite strong but it is never gratuitous and, personally, I didn't find it shocking. It is very well done in terms of make up and prosthetics, and very little (if any) CGI was used - another reason to admire Cronenberg. The cinematography is nice - lovely frames and good use of colour (as much due to Carol Spier, Cronenberg's long-serving Production Designer) - and the editing does exactly what it needs to without ever drawing attention to itself.I have to say, the more I think about this film, the more it continues to impress me. Before I started writing this I had given it 7/10 but I just put it up to 8. Who knows, maybe tomorrow it'll be a 9... Definitely one to watch, wait a few weeks and watch again.",A History of Violence

I love good movies and most of my top ten match the top ten of the majority of ""professional"" (i.e. they don't pay for their tickets OR their popcorn) critics but we part company in a major way when it comes to this movie.I can't think of one positive thing to say about this mess of a movie...strike that, Ed Harris is excellent as always and provides the only thrills in this flaccid thriller!Everything about this movie is extraordinary, and when I say that I am breaking that word into two parts as in EXTRA ORDINARY. The camera-work is pedestrian, the dialog is stilted and unconvincing and the acting, wooden at every turn.If there was ever a sterling example of gratuitous sex and violence this is it. As I said in the beginning, I am not clueless. I realize the film is called ""A History of VIOLENCE"" so I'm not surprised that there is violence to be had...what surprises me is that even the violence is pulled off without imagination. By now every six year old knows about exploding squibs and fake spraying blood and brain matter. So just being gross isn't good enough anymore, you have to be gross with flair. Obviously David Cronenberg isn't comfortable with his flair either because he exhibits none of it in this cinematic train wreck.And far as the sex scenes go, they could have been left with the dust bunnies on the editing room floor and the film would have been none the worse for it...and thatgra·tu·i·tous - adj. Unnecessary or unwarranted; unjustified. is the dictionary definition of those scenesWait 'til this comes out on DVD and then DON'T RENT IT!",A History of Violence
293,maatmouse-1,A History of Violence - the clue is in the title,8,30 May 2006,"I came to this film expecting great things of it. Sight and Sound (The BFI house magazine) rated it very highly and spoke very well of Viggo Mortenson's performances and those of Maria Bello, Ed Harris and William Hurt. But this was different. A rare pleasure in Cronenberg's work. A film that didn't go to unbelievably dark places like so much of his other work. A believable film. Few thrills. Quite an accessible film, considering the man's back catalogue.Mortenson is wonderful in his role of the main man of the piece. He initially plays a family man - a classic good guy. Happy family, good love life, nice wife, great kids. Then one incident in his diner forces him to reveal something else. That something else is a spot on an otherwise classic good guy. The idea that he might not be a typical family man, that he has a hidden past he has walked away from. You begin to understand why later on in the film when the other 'bad guys' turn up and cause havoc.This is a film which has you thinking straight away. Cronenberg isn't going to spoon-feed you the answer, you got to go out and find it. My favourite moments of the film come as we wonder whether Mortenson has rejected his good family or whether he has sold his soul to the devil (I'm sure that was what William Hurt was trying to portray in his chilling delivery as Mortenson's troubled brother).",A History of Violence
294,larry.launders,A History of Boredom,4,26 September 2005,"This movie can join the growing list of those that had a lot of potential, but I have to imagine that the cutting room floor contained sequences that would have helped the movie out considerably, and didn't contain parts that were left in the movie that didn't help it at all. Good cast and production qualities, though. ******* SPOILERS AHEAD ********* The opening sequence is going to set the pace for this movie. In other words, it is going to be very slow, almost boring in places, with the ever present possibility that it will turn the corner and become something interesting. By the time any action scenes, or things of real interest come along, the impact of them has already been robbed by being bored by the overly long setup.For all the time spent on establishing the two hombres in the beginning, only to have them be gone from the movie about a quarter of the way through in a scene that barely eats up two minutes of screen time seems a waste. The two are only established as 'bad', and that's about it...other than boring.Once the big event happens, our everyman character behaves exactly like we'd like to see him behave. He's not thrilled with having killed two guys, even though they were up to no good, but it happened, had to happen, and he prevailed. Time to move on.However, the news gets him some notoriety he doesn't want. Namely what turns out to be a big mob wheel coming to visit. The small town sheriff makes a comment a bit later in the movie that nails it - these guys don't expose themselves on a hunch, so why is he here? Which then brings us to a pivotal point in the movie: Is our hero part of some kind of Witness Protection program? Is he really the guy this mobster thinks he is? Is it just a case of mistaken identity? And not only is the sheriff asking this question (even if a bit rhetorically) but big bad mob guy shows up again where the wife and littlest kid are shopping, and plants the seed of suspicion in the wife who now asks the same questions.Now if you're smart enough to think about asking those questions, one presumes you're smart enough to consider what answers you would get. If he really IS the guy the mob thinks is he, would he say so? IF he IS in some kind of Witness Protection program, would he be ABLE to say so? And IF it is some kind of mistaken identity, wouldn't he stand on the same story he has been for the last however many scenes? Just what kind of an answer can you expect? It is at about this point in the movie, perhaps halfway through, that everything else that has been started to help flesh out some of our characters (sub-plot lines and such) completely disappear from the movie. Fortunately for the viewers those big questions do get put to rest thanks to a face-off with the big bad mob guys. Our hero wins again, but with the help of his son, who happens to have overheard an exchange of dialogue that condemns our hero to having had the past the mob guys thought he did.So the son freaks out. The wife freaks out later when she finds out. Then they have some weird gratuitous sex on the stairs. I'm all for gratuitous sex scenes, but this one just felt completely out of context.Oh and for those who really like Viggo, you'll get a healthy butt shot out of it.For those that like Maria Bello, she provides a few shots of eye candy. One of them even makes sense.Then of course, and there have been plenty of tips to this coming point, our hero gets a phone call from his big brother. Whom of course is still in the mob, but he could only rise 'so far' in the ranks because of what little brother did. And talk about telegraphing your moves...if William Hurt's mob guy, who is at some kind of boss level, is that bad at setting up one dangerous person to be done away with, it is amazing how he got where he was, unless he's up the ranks inside a really stupid mob, anyway.Another exchange of dialogue that doesn't help the suspension of disbelief is ""For crying out loud, you've been Tom Stall about as long as you were my little brother."" OK, from the looks of things, that means by about the time Joey Cusak is 20 (or so), he was infamous and needing a way out so he goes to Arizona and establishes a new life.WTF? And even if he pulls it off, how does our small town sheriff manage to get so much history on the mob guys that came to town, but can't find ANYTHING about Joey Cusak, the guy they think Tom Stall is? So yes, our hero returns to his brother, settles the old dispute by going back to being the guy he is accused of having been (which he was) and kills everybody.The ending scene was no doubt supposed to be a bit of a tearjerker, and could have been. But it doesn't come out that way, it just falls flat.This is an unenjoyable movie that has a few enjoyable moments in it. I give it as much as a 4 because of the good cast and good production quality. I give it as little as a 4 because of the direction and editing.",A History of Violence
295,nowonmai42,Viggodrome!,8,30 October 2005,"In the first fifteen minutes of ""A History of Violence,"" we get a small town diner, a baseball game, and a sneering, varsity letter-wearing high school bully. Throw in an apple pie on a window sill and some kids saying bedtime prayers, and you've got the Saturday Evening Post. But this is the work of David Cronenberg, whose films so often explore the blurry – and icky – lines between biology and technology. So it's not surprising when this film, too, heads for the gray areas, this time between the sensibilities of Rockwell and Tarantino.Small town diner owner Tom Stalls (Viggo Mortenson) runs the kind of place where you can eat at the counter, and ""see you in church"" is a standard goodbye. When he single-handedly foils a robbery and saves a few lives, then, the townsfolk are impressed and grateful, but not all that surprised. Tom is a Man, after all, and that's what Men do. But as David Lynch has taught us, pastoral postcard America often conceals deep weirdness and violence. The diner incident is of course big news in Anytown, USA, and Tom finds himself attracting not only local reporters who want to know ""how it felt,"" but also the Reservoir Dog-type Mr. Foggerty (Ed Harris), who isn't surprised that Tom knows his way around a gun, and waxes nostalgic about good times in Philadelphia involving barbed wire and a guy named Joey Cusack. Foggerty seems to think Tom knows exactly what he's talking about.Tom as ""local hero"" his family can handle, but after the Foggerty matter comes to a head, they do begin to wonder where these moves that would make Jeff Speakman proud are coming from. Perhaps more unsettling is the fact that they unconsciously sort of get off on their new image of dad. Junior soon finds in himself the will to flatten his jock tormentor, and wife Edie (Maria Bello) with some gusto acts out a rough rape fantasy with her hubby. Tom Stalls, indeed, but can't prevent the inevitable truth from coming to light nor catching up with him. That's shocking enough to his family, though maybe less so than the ways that knowledge affects them.""A History of Violence"" is fond of feinting toward familiar territory, only to veer away. Just when we think we've seen if before, in ""Natural Born Killers,"" ""Cape Fear,"" and the ""just when I think I'm out, they pull me back in"" tropes of countless mob flicks, it shifts its focus. For all its brutality, it comes across as a quiet movie. There is indeed more to Tom than he lets on, but less than his detractors might believe. He may be a liar in the strictest sense, but his protestations to his family and persecutors are sincere. The contemplation of violence, both pre and post-facto, rather than the acts themselves, drive the film. Whether the capability for, and indeed commission of, such acts permanently defines a person is left for us to decide. The film ends ensconced once again in small town tranquility, though this time seething with unspoken fear, accusations, and uncertainty. ""A History of Violence"" doesn't force itself with preaching or moralizing, but simply unfolds. It's another solid offering from the strong career of David Cronenberg.",A History of Violence
296,cardinalbunal,"Jesus, Ritchie.",10,28 October 2007,"The title and the foreshadowings make the secrets of this movie a little obvious. But we do care about the outcome; because the exposition keeps us involved, and tension, emotion and conflict build-up after the first violent confrontation of Tom Stall. I don't think the sex scenes were gratuitous, but they were nothing less than aggressive, so are the action scenes, with very graphic violence - and nothing hinders their artistic integrity because Cronenberg doesn't resort to fancy cuts or close ups. Otherwise, this is a slow moving but riveting drama about a man who deals with the past that has come to overtake him and his integrity as a man of family and virtue.5/5",A History of Violence

He pretends not to know who those guys are, yet he knew them, then why wasn't he overly concerned with his image all over TV? Where is the story arch, where is the hook, where is the plot? What are we suppose to walk away with?The film just seems like a concept first, then someone filled in the lines created a story from a 1 page script and then got some actors threw in some sex scenes to fill space and bang! another Hollywood junk product which will bring in money.",A History of Violence

299,thurberdrawing,A History of Cinema,10,9 October 2005,"THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS. I'm writing this comment not only because I thought this was a very good movie but also because its detractors seem to have misunderstood it. To misunderstand a movie or a book or a song is different from finding it good or bad. I've seen movies I have not understood and have withheld judgment until I've gained perspective on them. Many of the reviewers here clearly have bumped into a work too difficult for them to grasp and their reaction has been to express astonishment that anybody has found satisfaction in it. So, let me say this: The opening scene showing two extremely violent men committing their crime is, in itself, absolutely realistic. It's stark. It's neither exaggerated nor underplayed. The rest of the movie is deliberately off-center, because what the viewer is supposed to be thinking throughout the whole thing is ""Will this movie return to the soulless violence of the first scene?"" The crime at the start of the movie is unmatched. Gruesome things happen later, some of them rather comic, some silly, and some shocking, the most shocking ones being a slap, a moment where someone vomits as a result of emotion. Masks are torn off. But everything in this movie stems from the first scene, even though the plot itself doesn't relate to it. The main characters don't seem to know that the crime in the first scene has happened, but the mood its sets informs everything they do, if only because the person watching the movie always has this scene in the back of his mind. The first scene traumatizes the viewer. It softens him up, if you will. THIS is the world we live in, Cronenberg is saying. It's as if TAXI DRIVER had started with the climax. If this is a funny idea, then I suggest Cronenberg expected people to laugh at inappropriate moments, which is what has happened at many theatres, as a glance at three or four reviews here will show. People were laughing at the showing I saw, but I think they LIKED laughing at these inappropriate moments. This movie invites that type of laughter. We're supposed to find it funny. But there's one scene nobody laughs at. That's the first one. That's the one that's supposed to stick in your head and make you say ""This world shouldn't be this way."" I'm going to list a few things that show Cronenberg did a lot of things on purpose in A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE: When the cop comes to the house to question Tom/Joey about whether or not he's in the witness protection program we see children's building blocks on a shelf on the wall. They're two blocks with the letters ""E"" and ""T."" Tom (or Tom/Joey, if you will) is an alien in his own land and runs the risk of being driven from his home. I won't argue about this obvious reference to E.T. But it is only one of several flags Cronenberg has set up as a way of saying ""There's precedence for what I'm doing, here."" It doesn't matter if you're rooting for Tom or not. You can't deny he's the classic fish-out-of-water whose at the center of many, many movies: THE WIZARD OF OZ, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, THE WRONG MAN, RAINMAN, FORREST GUMP, and, of course, E.T. are all variations on the theme of the stranger at risk. Apple pie and coffee play a conspicuous part in this movie--a reference to the obsession with apple-pie and coffee in TWIN PEAKS. PULP FICTION informs the proceedings, with the prevalence of diners and wise guys. The family threatened? There's precedent: THE DESPERATE HOURS, CAPE FEAR, STRAW DOGS, THE BIRDS. The family threatening? THE GODFATHER. If it's played over-the-top (the scene with the brother) or below the radar (the son) it's because Tom's dual nature is being highlighted by his ridiculously bad brother and his milk-and-cookies son. Tom/Joey is his own SHANE, disrupting and protecting his own family. If you want something MORE grisly than this, but which influenced it, take a look at THE UNFORGIVEN (an update of SHANE.) References to other movies don't make a great movie, but they do indicate that things can be put in place for a reason. I don't think a frame of A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE is wasted. It's entertaining, thoughtful and chilling.",A History of Violence
300,druss44121-1,A History of Missed Opportunities,6,29 September 2005,"A History of Violence Much like its main character, there is much that the new release A History of Violence hides. Perhaps beneath its deceptively simple plot there once lied true significance, or maybe a nifty premise is all screenwriter Josh Olson had up his sleeve. Either way, one of the biggest disappointments of 2005 has just been unleashed.The latest from fairly infamous director David Cronenberg (The Fly, eXistenZ), Viggo Mortensen is Tom Stall, just your average country home dad. That is, until one day when two men walk into his restaurant bringing more than empty stomachs.Killing them in self defense and saving the lives of the few people in the restaurant with him, Stall becomes a hero and a mini-celebrity. However, all is not rosy as questions begin to arise about his past and why exactly he was so capable in killing his assailants.With this clever basic premise, this is likely one of the movies that critics will love because it is so vague that it simply ""seems"" deep.However, while as a 20-minute short film A History of Violence may have worked, as a feature it is simply a hollow beast that lags and drags without actually doing much of anything. True, at times the mystery is quite palpable and when the action and violence does occur it is appropriately gritty and believable (except for one moment at the end that involves a little bit of bullet dodging.) Besides this, though, the film is merely average, placing much faith in the success of an overall payoff that never really comes. It also tries to say something about human nature. There are some vague themes of evolution and history and the way we evolve not only as a group but as individual people, but it all mainly comes off as a simple puff of steam.There are also moments of intense raw emotion not trapped by any of the usual sentimental chords found in the typical family drama.The beginning is anything but raw, though, screaming ""Happy Family! Happy Family! Look at how happy that guy from The Lord of the Rings is, oh man wouldn't it suck if that changes??"" The script only really begins to come alive after Stall defends his restaurant and becomes a mini-hero, and even after this the moments of real tension and passion are few and far between. Especially near the end when it seems everything is coming to a rousing finale, the sad truth is that there is little left to be discovered.Tremendous clichés that border on laughable also abound. One of the best is the town bully who has a vocabulary of about three words. Something tells me he's been spending too much time watching Tom Berenger in The Substitute. Dude, the 80s are over.There are also two sex scenes, one of them completely gratuitous and unneeded, the other expressing some of the most complex emotions of the characters that this film ever dares to explore.In the end, the pretentious mess that is A History of Violence folds under its own weight. Failing to decide whether it wants to be a thriller or a drama, it balances the two genres poorly and never really hits a climax in emotion or tension.Ultimately proving that it really comes down to the script and the execution of the story, nearly everything else here works.The performances are all top notch. Viggo Mortensen is especially great, capturing with perfection the bevy of conflicted emotions within Tom Stall, the insanity and the warmness.The rest of the supporting cast is also top notch. Ed Harris is memorable as the lead man who stalks Stall and his family. Maria Bello is able make her shallow ""happy housewife character faced with a dilemma"" character feel real even if she isn't.David Cronenberg competently directs and the cinematography borders on gorgeous, mixing beautiful images of a peaceful countryside with the seedy underpinnings of city life. Also, the score by Howard Shore is unusual and unique, helping to add some class to a movie that at least avoids trashiness.Yet, with all this said and done this is still a film that just skims across the surface of its characters and ideas without ever plunging in head first. By the end, few of the initial questions posed are truly answered or even investigated.With this said, worse than the answers that are not given are the questions that are not asked. Except for one simple line, there is never a reason given as to ""why"" Tom Stall is the person he is, the person he has become.While certain things are best when they remain ambiguous, ignoring the complexities of the main character beyond a few pained looks is inexcusable. The mysteriousness works only to a point. There needs to be more than a few simple allusions to some vague clichés of old gangster films.Despite some haunting themes of bloodlust, sadism, and repentance, when all is said and done A History of Violence opts to keep it simple, giving the illusion of depth while actually choosing the road most traveled.Critic's Conclusion: One of director David Cronenberg's more mainstream films, this is tailor made to win awards and earn critical approval. Unfortunately, the actual film takes its unique and mysterious premise and goes nowhere with it. Lacking real depth or any conceivable twists, this is a thriller without the surprises and a drama without the emotion. For a better version of the same general themes go rent Unforgiven or Miller's Crossing.Rating: *** (Three stars out of five)",A History of Violence
301,karmaswimswami,The point of this film totally escapes me,5,12 December 2014,"""A History of Violence"" is a film with no generalizable theme, no deeper meaning, no point worth mining it for. It mostly works as a vehicle for depicting plenty of violence, particularly lurid face punches and graphic gut-splattering shotgun blasts...a wheelbarrow of gruesome ephemera. It's tough to discern whether Mortensen's part is too lightly written or just underperformed. The film's grotesque opening passage only serves to anoint the viewer with blood in a way the director feels needs to be done to establish the right downwardly mobile aesthetic mood. Maria Bello's character is human and well- played, but somehow doesn't belong here. Not a film I recommend....I resent having paid anything to watch it, and will not do so again.",A History of Violence
302,jon2005,A History of Violence,8,22 May 2006,"With the very first scene, director David Cronenberg sets up the tone and atmosphere of his latest film. Two men are talking at a motel for a few minutes, they go inside, and one of them kills a little girl. No remorse, no hesitation; just shoots her.And this is the kind of short, sharp violence that is interspersed throughout the film. Don't be completely fooled by the title  yes, there's violence, but there's not really much of it. What there is of it, though, is brutal enough that it should hurt the audience too.The film takes its time with setting up the story, and this is what makes the rest of the film so shocking. It's nearly halfway through before Tom Stall (Mortensen) is called to defend his diner from two evil types. Before this, we see him as the idealistic family man; wife and 2 children, all happy with their lot, well liked by the small townsfolk around him. Then within a couple of minutes this life is totally uprooted by Tom's defense of his diner. He's on television being branded a hero, and then the real trouble starts. In walks Carl Fogerty (Harris), who claims that Tom is actually called Joey, and was a gangster back in Philadelphia. And so begins Tom's battle to protect his family from these ruthless men. It is a testament to the writers and director that the is-he-or-isn't-he formula works so well here that we really are left guessing as to who Tom is, right up until the moment it is told to us. The family believes devoutly that he is Tom, Fogerty believes devoutly that he is Joey; and the audience is left wondering, and up until the moment of truth the film can easily turn either way  we are really given no clues, unless you already know where to look for them.Not much more can be said about the story or the violence without giving more away, but it must be said that this is not a film for the kids. It is brutal and graphic  we are shown the results of the hand-to-hand fighting in rather a lot of detail, but the audience needs to be shocked for the film to work. As a 12A rated film, it would be less effective, as it would be unable to convey exactly what people are feeling and how they react to what is happening to them.The performances from everyone involved are terrific. The film stands on the shoulders of Viggo Mortensen and Ed Harris, who both carry the burden with so much ease. Mortensen shows nothing of the possible ""Oh look, it's Aragorn"" type audience reaction, instead coming off every bit as a small town everyman. Maria Bello is also excellent with what she is given, portraying all the mixed emotions needed with skill.A History of Violence is not a long film, but length is not needed. We are told all we need to know, and by the end, the audience is still left questioning: will life ever be the same? The film does not answer this, instead letting us make up our own minds. It is a brutal film with a stark message, and whilst the audience should be walking away shocked, it will give you something to talk about for a long time afterwards. It is strange that this kind of film should be so compelling, but it is, and is definitely worth a couple of viewings.Rated: 8/10 More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",A History of Violence
303,loydmooney,recherché,1,29 October 2005,"This is a retread of fairly obvious ideas that have been handled much more masterfully by much greater directors. The notion of the violence lurking within us all has to be done and redone so many times that it is going to take something a lot better than this to move me very deeply. That said, I watched the whole thing. Near the end was a little ashamed to have done so, especially once he arrives back at the castle, the whole business of the brothers fighting it out, and then the obligatory tossing the gun into the water in a renunciation of everything he has become. Very clumsy stuff, and then the Quaker scene at the end was even more clumsy. Maybe the best of all time for the guy who can't escape his past is the great Anthony Mann western, Man of the West. The gang he returns to is much more scary, the fight Gary Cooper gets into is absolutely raw. However, the rapelove scene, whatever it is in History, near the last third, is powerful. Wonderfully shot in the stairwell, relentless, shocking. For it alone, I was glad I had almost wasted a good two hours in a theater. Like the crash scene in Aviator, it kept me from saying, ahh suckered again by all the wild reviews. Still it is pretty sorry when about all there really is new in a movie is one scene.

Unique or not, though his movies are garbage IMO. Now I know why I never heard much about this film since the ten years when it was released. The horrendous acting and amateurish dialogue (who writes this crap?) were cringe-worthy. The pacing was poor as well as scenes that just dragged on so long I had to fast forward to get through this.

307,stemelia21,It was a good film,6,7 June 2020,"I'd like to say first and foremost enough with the 10/10 ratings. This is not a 10/10 film regardless of who directed it. This site is not director category site. Rate it on how actual good it is.The film itself is ok, the storyline is simply but keeps you interested enough to finish the film. I feel it took a while to start. The transition parts where Tom Stall changes into Joey were good and well acted. I feel the film threatened to be more but never really pushed the envelope. The gore and sex scenes weren't bad at all and showed difference between Joey and Tom. The last bit of the film at his brothers mansion was the worst bit. Firstly a big mob / gangster has three /four guys to back him upon a situation like that, plus Joey's/ Tom's blood and finger prints would be all over the place. It just ended really rubbish.6/10 is a very generous rating for this film. Watch it but dont be expecting a 10/10 film.",A History of Violence
308,Tecun_Uman,A not so thrilling thriller,7,18 September 2006,"""A History of Violence"" is a pretty good film. Yes, it has a few flaws, like most films, but no glaring ones. As for the violence, I thought it was rather tame compared to several other films in recent years. In fact, I would say that the producers of this film were actually thrilled that some people were overplaying the violence, because it could only perk interest in the film. There are no real surprises or great mysteries here. All questions are answered fairly quickly. The acting is somewhat subdued. Yes, there are two sex scenes that are a tad stronger than most in an R rated film, but hardly stuff that would warrant a ""porn"" label. The film is a simple little story about revenge and facing your past, hardly themes that are new and fresh. I guess what I am saying, is that this film is OK, but when I hear things like ""brilliant"" and ""best of the year,"" well, I don't see it.",A History of Violence

310,Degree7,An unintentionally hilarious farce of epic proportions.,5,5 May 2019,"What else is there to say about this film other than wonder why everyone seemed to drink its koolaid without an afterthought? The Norman Rockwell depiction of America is so on the nose and predictable, you can see the story beats coming from a mile away. It only gets worse once the cartoonishly evil (and classically idiotic) mobsters from ""Philly"" show up, and start threatening our hero and his family by standing menacingly outside his house in broad daylight. I lost count of the innumerable times they said ""Joey"" in a faux-East Coast accent, while then letting ""Joey"" pick them off one by one as they conveniently fumble for their guns.By the time ""Joey"" has arrived in ""Philly"" I had already checked out, but it was entertaining in a B-movie sort of way to watch William Hurt ham his way through the last 15 minutes. But that's all you can take away from it; the picture fails as an action flick by having short, illogical and poorly staged fights, and falls apart as a drama once the camp factor becomes overwhelming. But if you wanted to riff this film for fun, it works splendidly.",A History of Violence
311,info-11400,"Slow paced, almost boring and a bit predictable",5,10 February 2007,"During large parts of the movie, Cronenberg takes his time. One can do that, if the images are worth it. But the film has a 70/80'ies look that is not at all interesting. The sex scenes are obviously a provocation aimed at American viewers. Well, I'm from Europe, I didn't really care, and I felt, the sex scenes made little sense for the storyline. The violent parts showed some typical Cronenberg gore. So what? The guy was a horror movie director in his first life. What sense could the partly excessive violence have? To shock the audience? No, they were far too mild for that purpose. To show the existential drive and power in violence? Have You seen the HBO series ""Rome""? That depicted violence of that kind, all the fury, all the rage, all the brutality, unforgiving. I didn't see anything of that in Cronenberg's film. That leaves us with the story itself, with the family/partner situation that is. With the strong elements of trust and suspicion. It simply does not work to my mind. The actors are great, but the story is way too conventional. Not disappointing for Cronenberg, but why nominate it for any Oscars?",A History of Violence
312,MiloMindbender,Cronenberg's worst (including Crash),3,5 June 2007,"I was a big fan of Cronenberg, but it's clear from this (& Crash) that he should stick to sci-fi. The premise for the movie could have been very interesting, but its actual implementation is universally awful. Nothing about this movie is credible. The dialogue is as contrived as it gets, Not of the characters are remotely believable, and the individual scenarios just don't add up. If the sheriff found out about the ties between organized crime, why didn't he ever contact the FBI when the family was being stalked? Why did everyone always neglect to call for help when they had ample time & opportunity to do so? Why did all the exchanges with the mob types go unnoticed by people in public places (the mall, the diner, etc.)? Why didn't the son ever comment to anyone about the harassment at school & when it was obvious to others at school why didn't fellow school mates say anything? Why does every scene have to be a big blow-out, ultra dramatic sequence? Why does the wife heave violently? Why does she hit him, then consent to have sex, then slap him and run up the steps? There is nothing in this script that is actually true to how people actually behave. From all the rave reviews, it looks like people have been so inundated with CGI & cartoon violence, that they think a manga with real people is somehow deep & involving. If you really want to see a movie that handles, sex & violence in a daring, but credible way, the French do a much better job. Check out Irreversible or Humanite instead.",A History of Violence
313,nived84,"Stunning and well executed, one of the best films of 2005",8,19 March 2006,"In director David Cronenberg's latest thriller A History of Violence we follow the story of Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen), the local town family man with a pretty wife and two kids. Tom owns a diner in the middle of the small town of Millbrook, Indiana, where life is simple and quiet. That is until two killers show up looking for trouble. One of the guys draws a gun and tells Tom to empty the cash register and threatens to kill the remaining customers. He responds by leaping over the counter, and gunning down the two men in an instant. Tom is considered to be a hero for taking down the two criminals, but he says it was just shear luck. Or was it? That's when Carl Fogarty (played perfectly by Ed Harris) shows up thinking that Tom is actually a man named Joey Cusack; a hit-man from Philadelphia, who nearly killed him many years ago. So who are we to believe? Is this all just a case of mistaken identity, or does Tom really have a dark past that he's tried so hard to keep a secret?A History of Violence is based on the graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke. The film is quite effective, especially in showcasing how fragile the human body really is. The brutal violence of the film is quick and sudden, and always justified. It's not shown in slow motion to ""milk"" or glamorize it, but to show it as Earth-shattering and vicious, which you hardly see in modern movies, because it's often stylized to look pretty and entertaining. But even as the violence is entirely justified in A History of Violence, it's also a startling reminder of just how ugly it can be.David Cronenberg's A History of Violence is not a film for everyone, some will really like it, and others will hate it. But whether you liked it or not, anyone who claims to know anything about films in general has to be able to admit that it is undeniably well made and acted, and at only 96 minutes long, doesn't waste any time doing anything other than storytelling that advances the plot and characters. That being said, A History of Violence isn't really about plot twists as much as it is about characters and character development. Only upon multiple viewings can you really appreciate the great performances from this cast. It's the small things, body language, gestures, eye movements; all of these things allow us to read what's going on in the character's mind at a given moment. And this is important for understanding A History of Violence, because this is an emotionally complex film, and sometimes it's the things that people don't say that speak the loudest.Cronenberg himself has said that he is a complete Darwinian, and the idea of survival of the fittest fits perfectly in context in A History of Violence, because deep down inside Tom is Joey, and Joey is the fittest to survive in a world of violence. But Tom is the person Joey wishes he was; an illusion of peace and happiness. It's not until Joey can finally come face to face with his own history of violence, that he's tried so hard to escape, and has successfully done so for quite some time (that is until he became a hero), that he'll be able to escape his past once and for all. That's why it's called A History of Violence, because it asks the question can someone change their own past history of violence and create a true, and authentic new life that's free of violence?",A History of Violence
314,PenOutOfTime,"Technically strong, but seriously flawed.",4,8 December 2007,"""A History of Violence"" displays skillful photography and film technique, but an excessively manipulative use of plotting renders the film unrealistic, and the themes of the film are unbalanced.Central to the problem is the desire of the filmmakers to make the film an internal struggle of a man against his own violence. This is of course, a perfectly worthy goal, but to make a great film, such a struggle must be SHOWN, and we are rather, simply TOLD about it, again and again. A man trying to shed an internal identity based upon cruel violence might be expected to display such violence when provoked, but while the protagonist is frequently engaged in combat, the filmmakers manipulatively blast the viewer with the most unavoidable excuses for every aspect of it.The protagonist kills some robbers at his café for example, but these are not 'mere' armed robbers, but are also (rather unrealistically) serial killers on a cross-country spree who intend to kill all the people in the café. We have the protagonist killing his brother, but a couple of hugs and references to such a relationship is completely overshadowed by the fact that this character is trying to have our hero garroted, shoots at him repeatedly, and to top it off, we are told that he tried to strangle the protagonist as a newborn baby.Now when our hero stands in the face of such provocations, and reacts only to defend himself or others, you could imagine perhaps, that he would be troubled, but we are shown little evidence of any predilection towards gratuitous violence of his own. This would be quite satisfactory if the movie were a conventional thriller, with the ""history of violence"" only a back-story, but there is insufficient dramatic tension to bring plot rather than the supposed inner struggle of the hero to the fore. Even then, it is quite inexcusable to fail to show some emotional tendency towards either passion or cruelty in the character of the protagonist. Our only real indication of such conflict is a dubious scene in which domestic violence turns into passionate and rough marital sex for our (twice wounded;both shot and stabbed) hero.Since the story fails to coalesce as a straightforward thriller (and indeed fails to deal with the events and their consequences very realistically) and because the film tries, but fails to delineate clearly a man's internal struggle for moral transformation, I am afraid that I cannot rate it highly. From a technical perspective however, the level of craftsmanship is high, fight scenes are well choreographed, and some of the acting performances are good, if incomplete as character portrayals.",A History of Violence
315,auberus,"In ""History of Violence"" the important word might not be so much ""Violence"" but maybe more so ""History""",7,16 March 2006,"History of Violence is an interesting piece of cinema. I would not call it a masterpiece but I do see some thought through elements that make this movie stands out and intellectually challenging. I like David Cronenberg's cinema. His movies are much more than wicked story, ""Videodrome"" re-invented sci-fi. ""Dead Zone"" besides being the best Stephen King's adaptation is a gem as far as character development is concern. ""The Fly"" is visually stunning and ""Crash"" speaks directly to our phantasm in a very kinetic manner.History of violence is no exception there is more to see than the shear scenes of violence. In fact in ""History of Violence"" the important word might not be so much ""Violence"" but maybe more so ""History"". In his latest work of art David Cronenberg depicts the story of a common American man and his family,Tom Stall who could be your average Middle West guy, except he is not...A dramatic incident brings back the dark past of this modern days so called hero. Now you could stop right here and that would be just fine but think about it, don't you feel there is something more to this story? IndeedDavid Cronenberg is drawing a parallel that speaks directly to our guts. Like modern America was build over a dark and violent times (Indian genocide, slavery...) Tom Stall's model life was build over violence and murder. The past of our respective country is our heritage, it is not a conscious one but it conditions the way we act and more directly the way we live. We have a collective violent past and therefore we are even deep underneath violent people. Moreover because we are violent deep inside we have a History (capital H) of Violence. The problem is this violence seems so natural and justified that it becomes profoundly human. Indeed we are men and women of violence. There is an animal hidden (or not) in our very soul and the love scene in the stairs demonstrates how fascinating and part of ourselves this ""animality"" is. This History is a genetic gift we pass to the next generation and the scenes where Tom Stall Son fights at school seems like a testimony, a way to show his family (the human kind) that he belongs. Our past will always resurface one way or another.We need to be conscious that the demons haunting our collective memory (the one of our respective countries) will come knocking on our door. We have a History of Violence and we need to confront it in order to tame it",A History of Violence

Either way stay away from this dog. This is the kind of movie that you find C. Thomas Howell in, but he was either busy or he thought this would be beneath him. For starters, the writing is really bad. The backbone of the story is a good one, there is tons of potential in it, but it seems that the words have been written by the last scrip writer left in Hollywood. Ed Harris and W. Hurt have a couple of nice little roles, but who cares, everything else is so fake that you can never get into the story. And then there is Ashton Hall, this kid must have earned his way into this movie the 'hard' way, because he is just AWFUL, every time he had a scene my girlfriend and I were screaming at the screen.

319,JohnFilmfreak,What's happened to Cronenberg?,7,10 October 2005,"Where's the passion in his films gone? Where's his sense of style gone? Where's the magic?While the movie wasn't bad, it wasn't great either. Just like 'Spider'; if exactly the same movie had come out, but Cronenberg wasn't the director, it would have caught some attention, but quickly been forgotten, like so many other slightly interesting films which lacked the final oomph!The characters seamed undeveloped and flat. Some of the stereotypes were drawn to such extremes it was almost laughable. Especially the bad guys at the very beginning.Then there was the half-hearted attempt at making the Stall family appear like the perfect, normal, happy family. The problem again was depth, or lack thereof to be exact. This family was so picture perfect, any president would be jealous. The acting was pretty sub-par all around, except for Ed Harris, who did a pretty good job, even though his character seamed like it was based on some comic book super villain. And guess what; it was!Overall the film had way too high tempo. There was too much to take in and thus, instead of dwelling at the important plot points, he rushes of to tell the rest of the tale. In effect, this makes the film plot-run, and not a character study like almost all of his older films were. Cronenberg films used to say: It's not what happens to the characters that's important, it's how the characters deal with it. Now it's the other way around.Had the film been a debut from a young inexperienced director, it would have been an interesting start to his/her career. We would say that whilst he/she didn't quite master the complex art form of film techniques yet, he/she was on a sturdy path and it would be fun to see what he/she could muster with more resources. - But from Cronenberg, the man who has given us so many other gripping classics, who has made movies which spurred debates on the biggest of issues and who has drawn us into worlds where the incredible seamed utterly believable; to now protrude this shallow, lifeless pulp of a movie which sole purpose seams to be crowd pleasing entertainment; is nothing but a tragedy. Now this was not an original Cronenberg script. Many people were very anxious to see how his announced 'Painkillers' would turn out, given a very promising synopsis. But sadly, the project seams to have been canceled. Was 'A History of Violence' then perhaps something he did only for money? To me, it felt like some producer was ruling Cronenberg by a strict hand. After trying for many years to create another masterpiece, perhaps also he had to take a break, just to make ends meet? Is Cronenberg perhaps cured of his bohemian inquisitiveness to existence? Has he lost his pain, thus also his passion? Is he simply too content in his life now?In short: Where's the Cronenbergism?Although it might not seam so, I really am a huge Cronenberg fan. He shares the throne along with Takeshi Kitano as my favorite director. I sincerely hope that 'Spider' and 'History of Violence' have been small chasms, and that Cronenberg will make his future films the way he used to.",A History of Violence

321,oliver-123,Very impressive,8,18 December 2006,"There are loose ends in this film - we hear no more of repercussions from Jack's final attack on the bully, or how Joey gets away from his brother's house without being arrested (surely all the shooting would have attracted attention and calls to the police) and back to his truck (but maybe he takes a car of his brother's?), and the hints that Jack has inherited his father's capacity for extreme violence are not really followed up. But these in my view only pull it down from a 10 to an 8. The acting by the protagonists is fantastic. Viggo Mortensen seems to have an uncanny ability to portray the shifts between his mild and savage personas in his face; Maria Bello is excellent as his wife, William Hurt in a short but memorable scene as his brother, Ashton Holmes as his son, Ed Harris as Fogarty. The violence is believable and not gratuitous, except perhaps for the first scene establishing the nature of the two criminals who are the first to die, but maybe that too is justifiable, and sets up the viewer to accept Viggo Mortensen's character as his family and fellow townsmen do in the beginning.

323,janet-55,That thin line,9,2 October 2005,"Cronenberg's film inhabits the same space, that of Smalltown USA, as ""The Dead Zone""; where 'heroes' are reluctant, are not Adonises, don't live in G-Plan Frank LLoyd Wright style of dwellings but in good old-fashioned homes with creased rather dingy wallpaper and flaky paint on the exterior, and are content to celebrate their apparent ordinariness. And it is precisely these touches of normality that Cronenberg utilises in order to manipulate both his characters and his audience. Cronenberg uses Seasons to punctuate and accompany the unfolding of his story as in the aforesaid ""Dead Zone"" where the changes of the year are brought to bear subtly on the proceedings. ""A History of Violence"" starts with two men very leisurely packing up and leaving a rather run-down motel on an already very hot morning. Hot, bleached out sunlight changes for the lush trees of Indiana where the body of the film is set. As the story plays itself out verdant greenery turns ominous flame red, then skies become grey and trees shed the leaves as the eventual truth of the story dawns. This is an often very brutal film, even in the second of the two love-making scenes.The whole film treads that thin line between acceptable and seriously unacceptable behaviour that we all know lurks only skin deep within us all. I believe that Cronenberg is asking questions of human nature in general rather than just that exhibited in the US in particular. This film must be a certainty for Oscar nominations and awards, not least for Cronenberg himself and definitely for the amazingly understated playing by Viggo Mortensen in the role of Tom Stall. This is a film not to be missed.",A History of Violence

Yes, we know those people are connected somehow, but there was no hint of their appearance: they just show up and say I am blah blah blah and there comes a fight. I would've expected the story to have a more layered structure where a guy is mentioned somewhere before he pops up on the screen. People might argue that the writer did it deliberately to keep Tom's identity a secret. However, I think coherence is somewhat lacking in 'A History of Violence'.

It's somewhat dramatic and somehow documentary. For those who just want to see some blood, it's probably a bit frustrating to wait and wait throughout all those annoying wonderful dialog scenes with boringly brilliant acting and all that but in fact, ""A History of Violence"" comes up like an old Greek myth and is capable of becoming a synonym for duality and much more. Tom Stall can stand as the two faces of each and everyone's mind. The story can stand as a example for karma, the power of the past and the unpredictability of life itself.

329,maxskyfan-9,No Beginning. No Ending. Weak Middle.,5,9 September 2011,"Every single movie I seen with Ed Harris I have liked, that is what got me into this film. The two other reasons: the title seemed to friendly hint at something and the synopsis - a case of mistaken identity. Later I learned History of Violence was based on a comic book, which makes perfect sense now because like many comic books there was little substance to the characters in this film. The movie really played off clichés and the depth of history shown was disappointedly shallow. Since the movie has come out, I have heard that the clichés in the film were use intentionally. Supposedly, the film subverts them. I really do not understand that. A cliché is a cliché is a cliché and I think it is best to avoid them. However, the director does not share that point of view. The villains are absent of remorse, wear black suits and drive a black car. The first scene in the film shows two other villains in the process of killing their way through a motel full of people. Is there a reason why they would do so? I guess they did not want to pay the bill or something. The scene ends with one killer aiming a handgun at a little girl's face. Bang. A director could not lay things out more black and white than that. Even Darth Vader on his worst day had more range. From the introduction, I found the time spent with the protagonist was lacking. I did not get a chance to know Tom and his family before all hell broke loose and after the fallout not much more. There is no need to worry about me spoiling the ending. I cannot give it away because there was no ending, no beginning and no ending. The middle events happen quickly and badly most of the time. Because of this time gap great haste was given in telling the story, shoehorning what should have been several scene into a couple. The most ridiculously drawn out scene is when we first meet the family. Tom's daughter, the most forgettable daughter in the history of little daughters, had a nightmare. One by one, the whole family comes out to see what is going on and then comforts her. The writing is plainly on the wall, here lives a loving family, but it comes off as phony as if I were to plant a sign with tree labeled on it instead of an actual tree. But you have to hang your hat on this scene because that is all she wrote. There is nothing holding the family together without it. If I took out this scene and say two other scenes then I would have removed the entire family. It is like a frame without a picture, scenes stack on top of each other like a house of cards. As far as storytelling goes Tom's son, Jack, is told like everything else – in splattered form, sort of like a painting Ed Harris would do in that Jackson Pollock movie, but not so artfully executed. I had to wonder why they gave Jack a girlfriend and gave her no lines; why have bits and pieces of a story with absolutely no need to connect the dots? The story seems to work against itself, again splashing around in the shallow end of the pool with the wimpy kid clichés. Was it asking too much to get to know Jack before he changed? Because Jack is an empty shell just like his bully, Bobby. With characters so unoriginal and boring naming them seems to be the biggest accomplishment. Bobby could be one of a thousand different bullies and Jack is no different from a thousand different wimps. There is nothing remarkable here. What is noteworthy though is how Bobby reacts when Jack catches one of his pop flys balls. As if the sky were falling. A bully's number one modus operandi is not to highlight any of their faults. It makes them look bad. But that is what Bobby does in spades. Bobby is a caricature of himself. The entire scene plays out as if in a fun house mirror with dynamite Bobby igniting at the worst possible moment and simply Jack shocked that he could make the easiest of baseball plays. From the look in Jack's face you would think he could barely walk to first base without falling down. In all truthfulness, though I cannot speak too poorly on William Hurt's character, Richie. At least with Richie you had some decent dialogue and I can look fondly on that. There are only really four characters in this movie. As much as I like Ed Harris he does not play a character in this film, more like a sock puppet. Tom, Edie, Jack and Richie are the players. Tom can think of himself as two people all day long, but it doesn't make it so. I did not buy that one minute. You have to show one side clearly, otherwise there is no way of telling which side you are looking at.",A History of Violence
330,JCBar,Not a Cronenberg Classic,5,14 March 2006,"The movie was not quite as many critics hailed it  it was cartoon-like (probably naturally since it was based on a graphic novel) and overly violent. The sex scenes were borderline ridiculous, with both Maria Bello and Viggo being somewhat too old to engage in 'cheerleader' sex, and later again with 'bang your back against the stairs' coupling.The script was banal at times, and unrealistic in spots. The scene where Viggo tells his son that you 'can't solve problems by hitting people' five seconds before he hits his son himself was laughable. William Hurt was somewhat wasted, and why his 8 minutes of screen time got nominated (the main reason I rented the DVD) is somewhat mystifying. In short, an overrated film for the most part.Still  the film was entertaining and engaging enough to recommend it to anyone who is a Cronenberg fan. It had satisfying set scenes involving the son and the town bully; strong vignettes with the menacing Ed Harris; and the short sequence with Hurt (while not worthy of a nomination) still was worth viewing. And for the first half of the film it did generate a certain amount of suspense. So, okay  it wasn't quite the film I expected, but at least it wasn't 'You and Me and Everyone We Know'. I rather sit thru 'oldtimer' cheerleader sex anytime",A History of Violence
331,zippyflynn2,Atrocious,1,27 March 2006,"Completely unrealistic, contrived clichés, sophomoric acting, terrible direction, atrocious dialog, moronical script, I guess you get the picture. I saw this piece of crap for free at my home and wanted to walk out demanding my money back. I kept thinking I needed to give it some more time because of all the raves it supposedly got, maybe it was going to get better. No, it only got worse and more irritating. Wasn't there anyone involved in this dog who has lived any of these scenarios? Forget the violence, how about being a parent, or a kid bullied in school? No one was believable in their roles, the only one who wasn't offensively bad was Ed Harris but that's because he was laughable, a cartoonish character (and I usually think he's great in just about everything, his ""Pollock"" was outstanding). But you can only do so much with an excessively stupid script. This appears to be written by a naive teenager who has gotten all his/her ideas from the usual garbage on TV and lived none of it. Everybody was trying to be so cute and clever and hip even after what in real life are traumatic events that I just wanted to barf. This is Hollywood at its typical atrociously, unrealistically bad. It's almost as if they went out of their way to be annoying and horrid. I'm having my house fumigated tomorrow after this one, it stunk up the place so much.",A History of Violence
332,okami_ito,"Great Cast, great timing.",8,31 August 2005,"I really liked this one. The story is told straight almost skinned to the bone. The characters are all over the top but believable and most of all the mis-en-scene of the violence featured here is brilliant. Though there are some funny lines here and there and some characters seem to be borrowed from the early Coen-Brothers oeuvre the killings are pretty realistic and grim and nothing to cheer at. A lot of dead bodies are shown in a very banal way so that the movies sometimes looks like a documentary about murder. Another great thing about AHOV is, that it's narrative is 90% about the life of average people and the rest is some kind of a perverted action-flick in every gory detail.",A History of Violence
333,BrigitteD,An effective history lesson.,7,15 October 2005,"In the continuing tradition of director David Cronenberg's previous films, ""A History Of Violence"" takes an in-depth look at the gradual metamorphosis and primal urges of normal human beings. It is a slightly more subdued exercise, yet, it still carries its reliable traces of visceral sexuality and brutality.Viggo Mortensen, stepping away from his ""Lord Of The Rings"" fame, portrays Tom Stall. Tom is living the American dream in an old-fashioned Indiana town where everyone knows each other, and in which any kind of aggressive act is seemingly non-existent. He is the owner of a diner and is both husband and father to beautiful lawyer Edie (Maria Bello), teenage son Jack (Ashton Holmes), and cherubic little daughter Sarah (Heidi Hayes).Before closing time one night, Tom's diner is infiltrated by two dangerous perpetrators who begin harassing the employees and customers. Instinctively, Tom takes it upon himself to pull out a gun and kill the two men in a rapid and perfectly-skilled execution.Soon, Tom is hailed as the community's hero through extensive media coverage, a title which Tom remains modest and reluctant about. The public exposure also brings along unwanted attention for Tom in the guise of a facially-scarred outsider by the name of Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris), and his pair of dark suits.Carl claims to have associations and unfinished business with Tom, who in reality, is a man known as Joey Cusack from Philadelphia. Tom seems confused about Carl's allegations, and must convince his family that he is not the person he is believed to be.Is Tom really the average man he claims to be or will he be forced to resort to a discarded identity he has until now succeeded in concealing? Mortensen really shines in his role as an outwardly soft-spoken and timid individual whose inner layers threaten to speak so much louder. Bello is quite solid as the supportive wife who finds herself both intrigued and repulsed by her husband's revealed persona. And young performer Holmes really holds his own opposite his adult costars, as the adoring yet doubtful son who must confront his father.As the villains, Harris is highly menacing, as is William Hurt, who appears briefly in one of the movie's final sequences which begins with black comedy and ends in crimson carnage.""A History Of Violence"" is a title which promises and ultimately delivers what it implies, not only through its graphic depictions, but also through the questions it raises about human nature within different relationships and circumstances, asking us if it's possible for a person to find complete redemption.It also examines the ripple effect of its subject and how far it extends onto others, an example which is shown in how Tom's son deals with a school bully.With so many films which seem to glorify and condone violence these days, it's refreshing to see one that takes the time to demonstrate the repercussions that are so often ignored.",A History of Violence
334,Vash2001,Brilliant and haunting,10,6 August 2006,"I managed to finally see this film- on DVD. That worked out well because the special section at the end is very good and informative.SPOILERS AHEAD.................The storyline is about a small town restaurant owner and family man Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen in his finest role) who has two unexpected visitors at his restaurant - two cold blooded killers Leland and Billy who pull their guns on everyone there. Tom kills them and becomes an instant hero. However, all the media coverage exposes him to unwanted company. Gangsters Carl Fogarty (brilliantly portrayed by Ed Harris) and his henchmen visit Tom in his restaurant and insist that he is Joey Cusack, a gangster who in the past had disfigured Fogarty. Tom denies being anyone but Tom Stall. In a stand off at Tom's house he kills the the gangsters (this was one of the most effective scenes in the movie), but his past identity is revealed to his wife and son in the process.Viggo Mortensen does an amazing exploration of the personalities with very few words but extraordinary facial and bodily expressions. Finally Tom goes to Philadelphia go to settle the issue, hoping for a peaceful resolution with Richie Cusack (in an amazingly complex performance by William Hurt), but ends up in more violence. Tom returns to his family but knows how much has changed between them. He is apprehensive as he enters. Will they accept him? Edie and Tom stare at each other and the rest is left up to the imagination of the audience.The violence is brutal, but short in duration. It does not drag. The sex scenes are meant to show how the relationship between Edie and Tom changed (happy and playful at first, and angry/complex later). Everything in the movie has a purpose that leads to the development of the relationships and the story itself.As Director Cronenberg has superbly crafted this drama/thriller. He is supported by brilliant acting by all the main characters who give Oscar worthy performances. I was disappointed that only Hurt got an Oscar nomination. This film definitely deserved a best picture nomination for 2005.The screenplay is to the point; no scene is wasted. The cinematography uses the light very effectively. Howard Shore's musical score is haunting and beautiful. This is a film that one does not forget easily because it brings out the issues of violence in our society, good/bad, who are we really, do we know ourselves and those around us, and so on.This is a serious and mature art film. If someone goes there to see lots of action and special effects, he/she will be disappointed. I highly recommend it to those who have an appreciation of the fine art of movie making.",A History of Violence
335,QuirkNFreckles,Leaves You Wanting More,10,17 February 2020,"This movie is mysterious from start to finish. So if you're looking for closure in a film, you may want to move along. I think it's wonderfully done, and Viggo Mortensen is always wonderful. But there's no closure. You still don't learn much of the backstory though you do know some at the end; you don't know if the family recovers from all of the drama or if ""Tom"" ever becomes himself again. So there's some conflict there. But it does leave you thinking about it, and maybe that's the point.",A History of Violence

338,toadwriter,I expected more,4,11 June 2006,"The worst critique I can give this film is that it'll be forgotten.Here's some questions for you...1)Did you like Mortensen as the lead? I could have come up with a hoard of guys who would have been better.2)If Joey's such a badass, why is Carl Fogarty (e.g. Ed Harris) still alive? Why didn't Joey kill him when he raped his eye with barbed wire long ago?3)Did William Hurt act that well in your opinion? I couldn't tell if he was a mafia thug or drunk. His accent seemed to go back and forth from a Tony Soprano impression to a bourbon drunk.4)And what is Ed Harris's story? We have to assume he's an enemy, but why? Some barbed wire incident. Zippidy doo dah...In ""A History of Violence"", too much history is taken for granted and I'm not buying it. I would liked to have seen some flashbacks.Wouldn't you have liked to have seen the barbed wire incident; or why Fogarty's still alive? There are many unanswered aspects. TONS of holes in this movie.There's too much explanation (and lead-in) of the history without actually showing us. I did not like that aspect of the movie.William Hurt, Ed Harris, and all their cronies act like they're still active mafia thugs. Now many years later, you think Joey's still going to be sharp as he ever was? Are all the other thugs just wimps except Joey? Come on. Joey walks through them like they're butter and that just seems unrealistic to me.Lastly, ""Joey's"" family: His son acted schizo, Maria Bello was either acting like an emotional wreck or a whore. The chemistry between the two sucked.Honestly, the best part of the whole movie was when their daughter puts a plate on the table for daddy.I give this movie 5 of 10 because I do like the storyline, I just wish 1 of about 100 other guys were cast as the lead instead of Viggo. Actually, I wish for a lot more. I could have written this movie better. I can't believe it got any nominations at all.",A History of Violence

I think my expectations combined with sex scenes that really added nothing to the film brought my rating down to a 6 out of 10.I did enjoy the action in the movie, and thought that the acting was good, especially Ed Harris' performance.If you have no expectations before watching this movie, you should enjoy it.... but make sure you have a strong stomach first since the movie does contain some very graphic sex scenes, and a decent amount of gore.",A History of Violence
341,go_titans,over-rated,5,11 September 2006,"OK, I'm sort of in the middle on this one. It wasn't as bad as a lot of reviewers are saying, but it wasn't as good either. The sex scenes sucked because it was obvious that the director was trying to show his audience an intimate scene from a perspective that they might not have encountered in a movie before - unless they are into porno - and I hate it when I'm watching a potentially good film and the director's intentions become obvious. In the end the sex scenes were completely pointless and odd, and shame on the editor for not doing his job and editing them out after cronenberg had left the room. The son's encounter I knew was coming up while it was still early on in the film (cos it was obvious again), but in the end this section too felt completely pointless and didn't really offer anything of value to the overall story. The opening scene was pointless to the film. Why build those characters up? Was it just to surprise us again? The overall violence was cool but the ending was abrupt and had me feeling a little cheated. The wife's role was handled badly by the director, the daughter was completely lame with her acting, the son was kind of plain and unimportant, viggo was fine, hurt and harris were fine, but I wouldn't bother watching this film twice.",A History of Violence

After Ed Harris is dead, there is no emotional impact to the Hurt character, whom we never really get to know, etc. An action movie without a satisfactory antagonist is, well, unsatisfactory.

The bad acting mostly came from the little blonde girl who doesn't seem to be an actress at all, and shockingly enough, William Hurt, doing some sort of combination of William Shatner and Tony Soprano.To cap it off, the film ends somewhat ambiguously when answering the burning central question of whether or not a person can move on from such events. I can understand if they want to IMPLY the answer, but the implication is incomplete.Real shame. This could have been such a solid film.",A History of Violence
344,Lemos,A Revenge flick a la Steven Seagal by Cronenberg?,5,25 March 2006,"I fail to understand what all the hoopla is about this latest Cronenberg film. I've watched most of his films and this was by far the most disappointing. It's basically a revenge plot very similar to the recurring theme in most of the stuff made by Steven Seagal. Granted both the main actor and actress do a better job, but for example Ed Harris and William Hurt must surely only be paying back some favour they owed Cronenberg. The school scenes especially are just pathetic and basically rudimentary. I really did not fully grasp what all the violence and history of it was really about, or why it was called for by any/all of the characters that carry it out. Pointless nonsense!",A History of Violence
345,shes_dead,Could have been better,6,12 November 2005,"Cronenberg takes a seemingly more mainstream story this time round and does OK with it. Not many trademarks in this film though  the usual bodily (dis)functions, grotesque apertures and make up are gone, replaced somewhat by sparse but intense and fairly graphic violent deaths. The trailer for this film was very good, so I had high hopes and was left feeling a bit let down. The film begins with some extended shots with minimal camera work, boringly focusing on a couple of killers who have no further role to play in the film except to get killed by Viggo Mortensen. We are introduced to the protagonist and his family via his daughter waking up from a nightmare. Mortensen comes in to calm her down. Fair enough. But then the son comes to join in and tell her about the shadow monsters and it's getting cheesy and is an all too blatant attempt at displaying a well-rounded all-American family. The scene becomes frankly embarrassing when the mother then decides to join in and put in her ten cents. I couldn't help laughing at its ridiculousness. Mortensen does well in this film and is convincing, as is Maria Bello. John Hurt is very entertaining in his brief appearance. The rest of the cast are dire. The son, Ashton Holmes, I hope to never see in a movie again. His bullying sub-plot was also clichéd and pointless, neither progressing the story nor adding any depth, but seemingly merely to pad the already fairly short film (at 96 mins) out. And there's no way that girl would be dating him.Ed Harris is type-cast and unconvincing. From the scenes between the family & the sheriff we are led to believe Harris & his henchmen are exceedingly bad, scary people. However, on screen Harris is jocular and non-threatening and parades around with a kind of nonchalance that conflicts with the character his is meant to be portraying. Kris Kristofferson would have been a better choice (Just look at him in Silver City). The 3 main scenes of violence are well shot and choreographed, being quite convincing and just about gory enough to satisfy any Cronenberg fan. The 2 sex scenes are also erotic & somewhat unique, but the focusing on the bruises on Maria Bello's back after the encounter on the stairs was unclear in its intention. Unfortunately it's the in-between bits that let the film down. The breakdown between the family is too rapid and therefore quite unbelievable, as is the laid-back demeanour of Harris & his goons as well as their careless inability to be discreet. The interactions between the characters, especially towards the end, seemed incomplete and poorly written, and the ending itself was a poor one for a movie, in fact the entire story seemed rather on the weak side for a theatrical release. The camera work was nothing to speak of (Sorry, I've just spent the weekend re-watching Spielberg's Duel - the camera work for which is fabulous) and there were no scary sex diseases, spooky TV channels, morphing body parts or alien-like creatures that so often set Cronenberg in a category of his own. One thing left to mention is the highly suspect (verging on the ridiculous) scene where Mortensen runs home - on an injured foot - for what seems like miles, in the amount of time it takes his wife to load a shotgun. Oh please.If you're a fan of Cronenberg's early work, like I am, then this isn't really for you as it seems aimed at a more mainstream audience.",A History of Violence

Viggo Mortensen is perfectly cast as the easy going nice guy in town just trying to run his business and love his family. An act of violence in his diner receives a reaction you have to see to believe. From that moment on, this film doesn't let up for a moment, keeping your interest and keeping you guessing. Is Viggo's character the nice guy everyone thinks him to be, or does he have a hidden past? The viewer is cast to and fro as they try to figure this out. Violent to be sure, but never over the top, as Cronenberg has often been in the past. A fine supporting cast, with William Hurt at his seediest. Not simply a violence movie for violence sake (as was Natural Born Killers), but a movie with emotional depths to be probed, which addresses the choices we make and the struggles we have to live our lives fully and they way we choose.",A History of Violence

However, this way he has drawn the attention to a gangster (chillingly portrayed by Ed Harris) who believes he is another character called ""Joey."" What follows are some pretty intense and violent action sequences, great acting and a brilliantly evolving storyline.The acting is superb on many levels and every actor / actress gets top marks from me. The action is short, violent and unsettling, which to me really defines the entire film...a bit short but very special. This was the only problem I found with the film, it was a tad too short and ended a bit abruptly.

With what they were given, the actors were great. THAT IS IT! Everything else was removed from the ""Violent Movie Formula"" cereal box and the plot can be seen coming a mile away. I was really disgusted with the TWO highly unnecessary, highly graphic sex scenes. Does Hollywood really feel that America needs more pornography? They were out of place, they added no substance whatsoever. If I want porn, its everywhere - I don't need it in my movies. Are these actresses so desperate for employment that they're willing to strip on film? Nudity and artistic expression are not mutually dependent - just watch a Bollywood film, sexual tension and passion are expressed fully dressed without even touching each other! Hollywood is too cheap to try something that deep when you can go for the quick thrill.

I liked the plot with the teen ager who gets bullied by kids, but I am not sure how that contributes to the movie. Viggo's performance was only OK, too wooden. I think we needed to see some subtly in the 1st half of the movie before we know his secret. Now the performance by William Hurt was excellent -- as good as the publicity said it was.

I finished seeing the movie about fifteen minutes ago, so the best time to write this is now. First of all this is not an all-out action film, so if you were expecting that, you will be disappointed. Now, aside from that, I thought this was an AVERAGE movie that could have been A LOT better. I thought this was going to head down a very good road in plenty of instances, but when I noticed that it was already an hour in, I was wondering what could POSSIBLY happen now. Mortensen is a great actor. I'll give him that. Harris is a classic actor. This film has plenty of good acting, enough to make us believe the characters and who they are and what they are going through. I liked Harris' character and the only one I felt for was Mortensen's. He gets ridiculous reactions from his family. I mean, he is protecting them, but he gets bashed at because of who he is/was. The man made a drastic change, and that is not even appreciated by the ones he loves. I would explain further, but I do not want to spoil this. The fact that this is more psychological and about how people fight so hard with themselves is very good and well-done here. Mortensen's character has mental wars and inner struggles, and I like the way that is done. The films are shot stupendously, and if the story worked out great too, this could have been a masterpiece and up in my top five films of the year. But now we must go to the reason why I graded this a bit lower than everyone else. There should have been a little more explanation and background to this movie. I mean, after about an hour and fifteen minutes in, I just didn't care any more about what happened. Things happened and I started to wonder where this was going. It's really hard to explain, but I didn't feel any history to the main character's violence. There should have been a little more of that--a little more mental struggle. Then we could have felt for him more. There should have been more story for the violent side that this man once had. The last ten minutes were too blah for me, and I just shook my head. It happened so quickly and there was almost no point for it. A lot of different things could have occurred. But alas, I will stop there now. It is really hard to put into words the reasons why I thought this movie was only average. It could have really been a classic film.

356,deltajuliet,"Skillful and engrossing film, though slightly flawed",7,4 November 2005,"The film opens up with a long take, showing two men ""checking out"" of their motel. I found this first take quite fascinating. It showed the men slowly moving from their motel room down to the motel's office. I want to emphasize that this take was quite slow; but it was fascinating. Having any knowledge about the film while watching the opening induces an edge-of-your seat mentality. One thinks something must be about happen. It builds up, more and more. And the greatest part was that the climax of the scene was basically cut, but we still understand it and comprehend it with a grim fascination. Never before has such and anticlimactic end been so climactic. The film significantly picks up its pace from here (especially in the last act), but it is always engrossing.These two men eventually arrive at Tom Stall's diner. As the trailer reveals, Tom (Viggo Mortensen)kills them to protect himself, his employees, and the customers within.The rest of the movie revolves around Philadelphia mobsters and Tom. After hearing about the incident in Tom's diner and coming to see him, they claim Tom is really ""Joey,"" a man who used to be a criminal in Philly. One of these men, expertly played by Ed Harris, even says Tom attempted to rip out his eye with barbed wire. We don't know exactly what they want with Tom, but we assume (probably wisely) that it isn't something good.The last act seemed a bit rushed, especially in comparison to the rest of the movie, but it was (unlike the first shot) a great climax. I didn't quite know what to make of the very last shot of the movie, and I still really don't, but it has stayed with me for a while now, and I still try to comprehend what each character was thinking. I thus feel it was a good ending.Onto the ""deeper"" themes of the movie. The film is largely about ""nature vs nurture."" Is Tom really Joey? If he is, has he changed his ways, supporting the nurture side, or is he still a violent man, supporting nature? I think the movie suggests the nature side of it more. Twice Tom's son engages in acts of violence. We feel that they are justified at least once, maybe twice, but is that why he did them, or is he also violent like his father? My feelings on this theme: the movie doesn't develop its theory. It simply suggests through actions that nature is dominant over nurture, but it never attempts to deeply examine these counterparts. It might have something important to say, but it doesn't quite vocalize it enough to truly let us know. The theme had a lot of potential, and Cronenberg did a good job developing it (I'd bet it's a hard theme to work with), but it wasn't quite good enough.***** I would like to emphasize that the film lives up to its title. ""Violence"" surprisingly doesn't have that much violence, but when it does, it's there in full force. There are also two very intense sex scenes. These contain very little nudity, but they are, again, quite intense.",A History of Violence

As a big fan of The Godfather, Goodfellas, and The Sopranos I was totally disappointed and even insulted how the director tried to pass those 3 guys off as ""mobsters"". They resembled more Moe, Larry & Curly. The ""Cusack"" brothers were also totally unconvincing in their violent roles. I especially couldn't take William Hurt as a ""Mob Boss"". I guess he was trying to be funny. I didn't find it that way. Did he ever watch DeNiro, Pacino, Pesce, or Gandolfini act? It's obvious that the director never did or he wouldn't have picked those 2 clowns to play those roles. The movie is more enjoyable if you don't take the acting very seriously.

""A History of Violence"" is a great movie that captivates from the first moment. The movie unfolds in the typical ""Cronenberg Style"" layer by layer and piece by piece. Mortensen delivers another amazing performance and shows why Cronenberg can always count on him. William Hurt, in his limited screen time, is even better and I wish we could've seen more of him. The movie lives less from the story and rather from it's characters and the effects the events have on them. All the actors have a great chemistry. Cronenberg does another great job directing and, as in many of his movies, the focus is more on the character building than the story. Also he is not afraid to show the violence and blood which really makes the movie more authentic. The cinematography, also as usual, is excellent. The many medium shots and close ups are perfect for portraying all the emotions and feelings that are portrayed on the characters faces. In conclusion we can say that ""A History of Violence"" is a great movie with Cronenberg's usual mystery and plot twists, great acting and usual great camera work.",A History of Violence
359,lea-1,The History Of Violence or How to be a psychotic mass-murder/rapist and not get arrested.,4,3 October 2005,"Why does a director choose to put ridiculously lame, poorly scripted, poorly acted, non-plot advancing throw-away scenes in a movie? In The History Of Violence, every single scene populated by the wife and children of the main character, Tom Stall, are throw-aways. Take them completely out of the story and it doesn't change a single thing. Tom Stall has no redeeming qualities, if he did then the script was horrendously weak in revealing them to the audience, perhaps the forced, uncomfortable and lame 'small talk' moment in the diner just before Ed Harris and friends arrive was supposed to fill in that blank? There was no palpable relationship between Tom and Edie Stall nor was there a single moment that would have made me believe that Edie was the mother and Tom the father of Jack and Sara. There were no solid indications that Edie, Jack and Sara provided Tom with any motivation to maintaining his invented personality, thank goodness the script made sure that we were told who each character was in every scene. (sarcasm intended) What exactly was the purpose and intent behind this movie? Were we to be shocked by the way violence so easily invaded this nice little town full of nice little people? We weren't. Were we to be disturbed at the aftermath of the violence? We weren't. Were we to be shocked that behind closed doors Tom and Edie were violent with each other and apparently keeping a 'kinky little secret'? We weren't. The whole 'role playing cheerleader costume bit' was completely unnecessary and very badly done. Vigo Mortenson looked as turned on by Maria Bello as I am by the lint in my dryer. The rape scene on the stairs was just bad.Cronenberg is seriously in need of fine-tuning his handle on the art of character development. His characters are flat, the dialogue improbable, contrived and beyond ridiculous. Sadly there just isn't enough substance in any of Cronenberg's movies to make it worth my while to spend a lot of time thinking and writing about them individually but as a whole it makes for an interesting psychological profile study.My final thought on The History of Violence (and most of Cronenberg's movies) is this: What was the point of that? Are we all just indulging Cronenberg's exhibitionistic style of mental masturbation? Too often I feel like I just slipped a quarter in a slot for the peep show and it should have ended 30 minutes earlier than it did. I just wish that Cronenberg would give his audience something to latch on to and become involved with, instead, Cronenberg's audiences are largely just waiting for the movie to end.",A History of Violence
360,what3v3r,"Turn of the lights and let the ""violence"" unfurl.",9,6 February 2006,"I decided to come up with this writeup a week after I saw the movie. It definitely sticks and lingers on. David Cronenberg's direction is responsible for everything that this movie offers from ""on your face"" violence to ""smirk inducing"" dialog. A movie such as this is purely based on viewer perception as it hinges on non-conventional type of portrayals. Halfway into the movie, it matures into a decent thriller with sex and gore poignantly placed to fulfill Cornengbergs motive of delivering the tag-line successfully. The awesome camera-work(its really thriller-centric!!) and the ""Shore"" soundtrack really capture the gravity of the moments. In the wrong hands, the movie could have turned into a disaster crafting learning societies across censor boards. This movie demands its viewer to think and I would prefer to watch this movie alone on a silent night when my gray cells wont fail to capture everything to do with Tom Stall' or his alter ego's life. ""History of Violence"" had got three pillars a couple of them with gunshots and an another which by my terms is one of the best placed(in terms of movie context) sex scenes. Acting, particularly Mortensen and Bello adds all the required ingredients into the movie - innocence, fear, trauma, violence, love passion and more. The real celebration of the movie' spirit unfurls when Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) is accepted back into his family led by his little daughter notwithstanding Tom's dark and grotesque hidden past. All the killings and deceit just seem forgivable and there is an air or warmth and mushiness before the credits show up.",A History of Violence
361,tricksixxx,Decent I must say.,6,19 March 2006,"This is a very hard movie to review. On the one hand, it's very easy to watch and not get bored, and the acting is performed remarkably well. But I must say, the story was a little far-fetched, and it was not as brutal as some will have you believe. I mean the sex scenes are not that ""graphic"" and the killing in the movie are not that ""strong brutal"". I've seen this kinda stuff in the whole Lethal Weapon series, Casino, Goodfellas, American History X and a whole slew of movies that had way more good attributes than this one. So the shock value was 0. The screenplay was just average and it just didn't create that spark that leaves the viewer and awe and seemingly addicted to the screen. Even still, the fight scenes are very well executed and realistic, and the action is in the realm of believable unlike some movies. The camera/directing is really nothing special and it seems like the whole movie tries to revolve around some kind of obsolete shock value and its solid acting. Maybe I set my standards to high for this one based on IMDb user reviews and others, but this is just a decent little action flick, nothing more. 6/10",A History of Violence

First section we don't know what's up with Stall (Mortensen), second act is Ed Harris being odd and not quite typical charismatic Ed Harris. By the third act, the film unravels, the main character becomes vague with very little back story, the family starts acting erratically, the truck that's been hinted to being broken down is magically fixed, and Vigo looses his attractive edge that he's honed over the years from playing Aragorn. The end, while I wont spoil, is a total toss up. If you liked Killing Them Softly, and other similar overly violent flicks, you'll probably like this.(The sex scenes are hot and had to be awkward for both actors.

369,blue__yoshi,Graphic Novels,4,29 June 2006,"This movie suffers, in my opinion, because of its source material.Considering Cronenberg's style (who in the past has moved me to tears and moved me to fast forward), this is fairly tame. I had gone into the movie not knowing anything but hearing good word of mouth. But as soon as I saw 'based on the Graphic Novel' I had a sinking feeling. (Why o' why can't credits be put at the end of a film?) The problems I have with this movie stem largely from the source material - Graphic Novels require interest to be held for every frame of a page. They don't have time for subtle character development and they can't waste time with low-key characters. And so in translating a graphic novel to film everyone becomes cardboard cut-out characters, (like the bully). Or scenes become very obvious in their intention - like the cheerleader scene, (to set up their relationship, and the fact they didn't spend their youth together). You expect a certain amount of exposition in a film but in 'A History of Violence' it was not very subtle. They might as well have just had a crawl over the opening to explain to the audience the situation.Also many shots had a 'Graphic Novel framing' i.e. big faces close to camera, characters illuminated in darkness. This is not so much a criticism of the film, just a personal dislike.Graphic novels are full of tough-guy detective types and criminals (like those in Sin City). And that's why I don't read them. They're just too broad with their character brush strokes. They're kinda like adult cartoons. Which... well really, they are - adult comic books.The only benefit of this movie coming from a graphic novel is that they used a shot of a letterbox to reveal the Stall family name, and a shot of the Post Office to tell us the name of the town. In a poorly written film the screenwriter would have tried to fit that information into a badly written line of exposition. (Although the Sheriff did drop that line about their being some guy with a similar name living in Philly).If you enjoyed the hardboiled style of Sin City, and you long for the revival of Film Noir and those 50's detective stories where men are men. Then you may very much enjoy this. You should probably also be reading graphic novels too, they're full of this kind of stuff. I'd prefer it stayed there.",A History of Violence
370,daniel-ambia,the worst film of the year,1,19 January 2007,"A History of Violence obviously greatly appealed on some strange level to most critics across the country. It did not, however appeal to me or any of the other twenty something people in the theater when I saw it. The story begins with two obviously insane killers murdering a child in a gas station. Then we are taken to a small town where a local diner owner turns out to have once been affiliated with the mafia I guess. Well the two killers attack him and then he kills them. Then the mafia finds out he's there and they come after him. Well he kills all of them too then he goes back to his original home and kills the rest of the mafia people who are after him. The plot is not too original, kind of reminded me of my blue heaven with Steve Martin. But what had me booing the film out loud in the theater was the acting. The acting and the script were terrible. And honestly I like Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen. I liked Pollock and I liked Lalene in Carlitos Way. Somehow this movie was embraced by the film elite a group of people who praise boring, crappy movies for god knows what reason. The worst is in the end when he is confronted by the boss who keeps saying Joey over and over again in a horrible fake tough guy accent. Who ever that was I believe he was nominated for an academy award for his five minute contribution to the movie. The only good part is when the son of ""Joey"" beats the crap out of a school bully who has been bothering him. What is wrong with Hollywood today. I do not know. But this film was possibly one of the worst I have ever seen. In fact my friend and I hated it so much we almost walked out but since we lived in NYC at the time we had just paid nearly thirteen dollars for tickets.

371,joshstep41,America The Beautiful,8,15 April 2006,"Cronenberg returns to his thematic trappings of violent organics with this subtle pick of American masculinity.The script itself appears to be short and weak, but the film grows wonderfully with Cronenberg's thematic style - notably his Canadian perspective of small town America and the inherit destinies of its progeny. The film's ultimate strength lies here with Cronenberg's exploration of sex, violence, love, and family. His contribution is much more dynamic than the script ever could have been.Cronenberg portrays violence as a sort of hidden plague among the lands and people of America. The recurring career theme of sinister genetics is presented here as heritage in the protagonist's struggle with his past and the future that lies with his son's first handling of a shotgun. There's also an intriguing aspect of duality when Tom Stall says whole-heartedly that he killed Joey Cusak in the desert. The concept is also mirrored in the two sex scenes and rather effectively in the subsequent moment of looks exchanged between husband and wife.Mr. Cronenberg appears to have met the perfect vessel for his work with actor Viggo Mortensen. The two are so well suited for one another with this project that it is much like the child of a passionate love affair. All of the actors deliver, but Mortensen carries the film himself - it feels as much his as it is Cronenberg's.Although engaging and definitely cathartic, the presentation of two key action moments (the diner and front yard scenes) fall a bit short due to Cronenberg's lack of proper pace editing in tight moments. There is also a scene where Mortensen is accosted at home by a television news reporter that falls very flat due simply to lack of proper lighting. However, these are both easily overlooked in comparison to the oddly humor-laced third act. The light comedy is appreciated, but feels rather awkward given the preceding mood of ominous foreboding. This is in part personified with the performance of William Hurt  who oddly enough received an Academy Award nomination.The film concludes with a superbly poetic scene at the dinner table  where all American tales end  which reconnects the story securely into place. The final shot further reflects this with Mortensen's eyes  an image that captures the thematic bondage of the tale.A welcome return by Cronenberg.",A History of Violence
372,FrankDamage,History of Mediocrity.....,5,2 February 2011,"...is what this film might be referred to when they look back over Mr. Cronenberg's otherwise illustrious career of thriller and horror films.I remember watching Scanners as a young child of 7 or 8 and the indelible impact it made on me. Not only in my future love for film, but in terms of some of my perceptions at that moment and of horror films in general, that I would come see in the future. One characteristic I distinctly recall being aware of, even at that formidable age, was a certain type of pause, silence, or dead space, that was present in the film. It's something very characteristic of '70s films and also a technique that's been cultivated and used in varying degrees by directors such as Kubric, Wes Anderson and of course Cronenberg. In Cronenberg's films however, it tends to aid in giving a ""kind of"" b-movie feel to the work that usually enhances the terror, or anticipation of forth coming terror, without compromising the quality of the film itself. This film is the first I've seen of his where it was not used, but still comes out feeling like a b-movie. Which in this particular case was not helpful to the film.While the storyline is plausible (some time ago an actual person in the witness protection program brought unwanted ""mob"" attention to himself as a result of a confrontation, though not a ""heroic"" one, in the town in which I live) a great deal of the acting is not.To start with, Viggo Mortensen does a very good job initially in his role as Tom Stall, however the subsequent transformation that is needed later in the film, never really seems to manifest as convincingly as is required. Later in a passionate scene between he and his wife, it seems that it is intended to somehow establish a kind of appealing savagery to his character, but it just doesn't do enough to cement what we are supposed to believe about him by that point. Even with all that's already taken place.Another flaw comes in the casting of William Hurt as Stalls' brother Richie. As much as I generally enjoy Hurt's performances, he's simply not convincing in this role.Overall as a fan of Cronenberg, or as a fan of thrillers, one might want to take a look (if you can do it for free). However, don't go in expecting much and you won't be disappointed. The biggest mystery in this ""History"" is the reasoning behind all the hype this picture has received. Violence yes, but one of Cronenberg's best? Not by as long shot.",A History of Violence

This makes you realise that the aforementioned premise is itself unbelievable, that not even the 'magic' of film can paper over that crack, and that in fact those first 45 minutes were a wasted cinematic journey.The ludicrous script is strung together by a series of violent and bloody scenes which are all strangely similar to each other - so the scenes of violence end up being boring as well as exploitative and comic-book in nature.I wasn't surprised to find that the script was based on a graphic-novel (they generally lead to the worst kinds of film adaptation) and as one of his most mainstream films this marks a low point in David Cronenberg's work. In the past, even when his films have been flawed I have still usually found them original and interesting, but A History of Violence sees him capitulate most completely to commercial Hollywood tastes - it's a shame.A very strong cast fights hard against seemingly impossible odds - but their fate was sealed long before ... during the writing process.

375,JennyMenny,Mediocre,5,15 March 2006,"After reading some of the reviews, I am wondering if I saw the same film. I rented this last night, and I was expecting a great film. What I got was a mediocre attempt at greatness, a film that got caught up in its own supposed ""greatness."" The movie is SLOW.... I don't mean parts, I mean the whole film. When anything happens, it is crammed into one instance, with eons of pondering afterward. For example, the burglary in the diner. Don't blink or you may miss the part when he kills them. Then, we get an in-depth study in the reaction of all people involved. Note, however, that this was not good movie-making. This was dragging out your point. Then, take for example the so-called stand-off at Tom's home with the Philly mob guys (More on that laughable portrayal later on). They talk, they talk, they say come on, Tom then jumps into action thrusting one bad guys nose into his brain, shoots the other, and then the meek son decides to blast a hole in ed Harris. OK, right.... then more pondering, more thinking, more inaction.Then the end.... the penultimate scene....the shootout at the brother's house, followed by the drive home, which he magically does in enough time to stay in the dark the whole drive, followed by the unbearably slow dining room scene. Ugh.What was the point? That Tom Stall was a psychopath Mob killer who buried it away just until someone threatened him. Then....all of a sudden... he turns into this killing machine, which he can control and then goes back for dinner with the family who make him stand for a few minutes, but then let it go. The sex scene on the stairs?!? I don't get it. Now someone will give me some long symbolic explanation, but rational people do NOT act like this. If a movie wants to avoid being labeled a lame action film, or a predictable thriller, stop adding movie-like stuff to it. Am I supposed to feel bad for Tom Stall? For Joey Cusack? For the family, especially the son who really asked his dad if he would ""whack"" him? OK - Now for the WORST! William Hurt - a head of a Philadelphia mob family with Viggo Mortensen as his crazy younger brother. Superhuman little bro Tom Stall killing all of big bro Richie's bad guys and then putting one right between his eyes. The mob stuff was pathetic! - with the exception of Ed Harris who was at least fun to watch.I can't even organize my thoughts to comment because this stupid movie has me all garbled. I just kept waiting for some direction, some clarity, some structure, but what I saw was a bunch of separate scenes chucked together to form some semblance of a finished piece. This is not a study in violence, it is not more admirable because it didn't play on the gore factor (which it kind of did because two people had they brains blown out by the same guy). It even played on the sex factor as well with the scene in the beginning and the end.All in all, much of it seemed pointless. I was not moved. I was not inspired. I felt like I wasted 2 hours of my life watching someone's lame excuse for a thriller. It wasn't even thrilling, not poignant, not thought-provoking.I am a big fan of films.... I generally try to see the good in all but this was really horrible. I might actually say I hated it. It, meaning the film itself, seemed to think it was better than it was, if anyone can fathom what I mean, and conveyed that sort of emotion throughout, and that made it pathetic, lame, uninspiring, unimaginative, and uneventful.I wouldn't waste my time again.",A History of Violence

I finally watched it, although it was hard to sit through, and became sick. I couldn't believe it was going to actually end there, with them sitting at the dinner table. Characters come and go. And come and go. And COME and GO. Nobody, except the main characters, stays for more than thirty minutes. The opening scene is far too long too. They weren't even big characters and Croenberg spends the whole opening scene on them. The sexual scenes are done well though. Meanwhile, Mortensen plays his character decently. At first, I was like, ""He isn't believable as a father at all!"" But I soon realized, that's the point.

You can actually see the gradual change as he turns from small town family man into former mobster hit-man as the movie progresses. On second viewing I was able to truly appreciate this, how his accent, even his facial expression changed from one of cruelty to one of normalcy. And William Hurt.. playing Tom Stall's brother. Hurt was only in about 5-6 minutes and that was the only bad thing about the movie. He is incredible in this film and it did not surprise me when he received the best supporting actor nomination for his excellent performance.This is a movie about violence. Not just a film which features violence but one which explores the nature of violence and questions it's portrayal in films. Cronenburg is far from Alien to dealing with the theme of mutation in his films, but here that mutation is mental rather than physical with it slowly infecting every aspect of the family's life from the son's behaviour in school to the sex life of Tom and his wife, Maria Bello. The final scene of this film is a heart-rending piece of nihilism which is as much a comment on the audience as it is on the characters.",A History of Violence

William Hurt, Ed Harris and Maria Bello all do a fantastic job co-starring in the adrenaline pumping action flick. Cronenberg makes one of the years most action packed film since Face/Off.

379,Acolin_f,Cronenberg hits one out of the park,10,30 August 2009,"After four decades of making creepy movies like Scanners, the Dead Zone and Dead Ringers, director David Cronenberg hits one out of the park in a movie which captures the swift, unfair, coldly-calculating raw emotions of violence and the sheer impact its micro-second life has on the rest of ours lives forever.Last year, A History of Violence was toted as one of the Academy's best candidates for movie of the year. After finally getting a chance to see it from Blockbuster, I can see why. This movie slowly gathers force and rips through our sleepily lives like a tornado. There are no plot surprises here.A mere whiff of a hint of what we already know. A peek at the deep abiding love only a few of us are luckily enough to know. A truth about the quiet little joys in life, the power of love and the frightening, big bad world that surrounds us. With a tenderness that almost makes it a love story, a warmth that encompasses a family flick and a sudden horror that never looks away from blood, gore and an awesome talent for killing, Croneberg builds upon Viggo Mortenson's heroic Lord of the Ring performance with few words, intimate close-ups and a thoughtfulness reminiscent of Clint Eastwoods' wonderful Unforgiven, Mystic River and Million-Dollar Baby, in which company, this excellent film certainly deserves to be mentioned.On my dollar scale, where rentals score $5 and ownership is $20, I give History an easy $15, maybe $20. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I could rent this again, if only to comprehend the swift brutality of the action scenes juxtaposition with the raw sexual attraction the husband and wife feel for each other and the vastitude of familial bond. Powerful stuff, their lovemaking. Incredible stuff, this horror of butchery. Hard to see this movie as a mere R rating.Own it? Perhaps, if only to prevent this vision of yin and yang in our lives from disappearing into the gray horizon. ""Balance,"" the late Pat Morita extolled in The Karate Kid. Life is about balance. What makes this movie so good is the horror film master balances the fast scenes of unbelievable and unremittingly carnage with the ingrained sedateness and yet passion of a successful everyday life. We have within us, each of everyday us, the capacity to unleash a road rage of anger at the frustrations of modern life. Cronenberg unleashes the fire here with the deft skill of a pyro who loves the flame.",A History of Violence
380,Brewski-2,You won't see another film exactly like this one anytime soon,10,5 October 2005,"Others, in fact many others, have commented on the perfect casting, great acting, rural scenery and hometown sets and the appropriate use of violence and brief nudity. They are all right but here are some other things to look for.***** Spoilers Follow***** This is a Second Amendment movie - perhaps unintentionally - but the private ownership of firearms (and not handguns) allow a family to defend itself and allow a son to save his father's life. Also it shows that a familiarity with firearms allows Tom to defend the diner and his family and himself and an unfamiliarity with firearms almost keeps the wife from defending the home - she never cocks the hammers and can barely get it loaded.There have been several movies about ""cop gets family killed and goes on rampage"" from Mad Max, The Punisher and, sort of, Man on Fire. We are supposed to cheer or at least sympathize with the Vigilante bent on honest and well founded revenge. But this one of the first that leaves the vulnerable family as an additional worry for the vigilante/revenge guy to factor in.Ivan Reitman speaks about ""casual nudity"" in the 1980's when Stripes was filmed (watch DVD commentary) and questions appear about the need for the full frontal. I see this as the wife's way of showing Tom what he will be missing as she goes to another bedroom and shuts the door. The director teases more than shows in earlier scenes and that is all appropriate.Others comment on the closing scene and this is an ""A implies B"" scene where the daughter accepts daddy's return, then the son accepts daddy's return and the next logical step is mommy accepting daddy's return. You do not need to hit the audience over the head with it - except of course for those that demand to be spoon fed.There are the timeless values of Love conquers all, violence must be used to meet violence, good wins over evil, a person can repent their sins and be born again, family is the most important thing in your life, Like father - like son (as to be pushed over the edge), etc.I did not like the gratuitous drug use (joint smoked on main street) and there was a couple that brought a 2 year old to the theater which should almost require a call to DCF.However, it was great to see cinematography as art with scenes that just fill the senses. Once again Canada poses as rural America (Superman, Marlow - the HBO series, etc.) See it without your children.",A History of Violence

It gives us a great dramatic intensity with a permanent suspense. The soundtrack is as fantastic as the poster: Viggo Mortensen, very sober, is remarkably efficient in this double lead role.

382,bhagathp_v,A great plot not exploited to the full extent.,5,29 April 2014,Well ...Here is a movie that had a nice plot. An overnight hero who spoils the fun of gangsters in his stall and thus hailed by the small town is recognized by some other gangsters as one whom they have been searching for and wants revenge for his past actions!. Is this a case of mistaken identity or is this true?. Vigo and Maria Bello do a good job and so does other cast too. Screen play - not bad. But the whole point is movie unfolded in a predictable fashion and that was the only surprise - for this plot one expected lots of twists...could have been good. When the action sequence was expected after a tense situation (good screen play) - the actions actually fell very flat. It was disappointment for me. Can watch once with. My rating is 5 out of 10,A History of Violence
383,tacmovies,Aragorn isn't bad with a gun!,9,18 December 2009,"Story: The story is probably the worst part of this movie. Without summarizing the plot and keeping spoilers to a minimum, if the cops in Indiana and the cops in Philadelphia were to compare notebooks, it would be very easy to identify the killer at the end of this movie. Also, Viggo manages to overcome the odds so many times that it wouldn't surprise me if he were to also win the next week's powerball after the end of the movie, and William Hurt's character even points this out when he has the infamous line to his mooks, ""How do you f-ck that up?"" Some of the characters are written to be supershallow, such as the two killers at the beginning of the movie and the high school bully. That said, there enough story to keep this movie afloat. I wouldn't have minded a little more, but it gets the job done... but, then again, this movie was nominated for an Oscar for best writing of an adapted screenplay in 2006, so what do I know? C Acting: There are a lot of great actors in this movie, but I'm going to skip to the Sheriff who is played by the great Peter MacNeill. What? You don't know who Peter MacNeill is? Well, I'm not surprised. He played Hawk on Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future, probably my favorite TV show growing up, even if it only went one season. I want more work for Peter! Anyhow, Maria Bello was amazing(ly hot in that cheerleader outfit) in this movie, Ed Harris isn't on screen very long but leaves a major mark, William Hurt got an Oscar nomination and I support that one, and Ashton Holmes has some of the best facials in this movie I've ever seen. The scene where Maria Bello gets out the shotgun and Viggo runs home and bursts through the door was made by Ashton Holmes reaction as their son, sitting eating his cereal, confused beyond reason about what's going on. I loved that scene, and I think Ashton's reaction could make any scene in any movie funny.Enough about the supporting characters: How does Viggo do? Well, that's a difficult question to answer. (SPOILER ALERT IS OFFICALLY SET TO FUSIA) I didn't find his portrayal of Tom Stall to be all that convincing, but I almost think they did that on purpose because he's not really Tom Stall. I believed him as the action hero, even in the most implausible circumstances (except when William Hurt shot at him at point blank range three times and somehow managed to miss... Stormtrooper Marksmanship Academy, it's the only explanation!) and I believed him when he became Joey again. So, him playing Tom a little fake isn't necessarily a bad thing, and may have been a deliberate thing. (SPOILERS ALERT IS NOW LIFTEDED) All in all, the acting gets an A! Direction: The first shot in this movie is almost two minutes long... and it's beautiful. The cinematography in this movie is beautiful. The editing is beautiful. It creates such a brooding mood and it completely sucks you into the movie. The action sequences are over very quickly, but they're good and powerful enough that they'll be the strongest memory that you have of this movie. I also love the way that this movie uses the way the characters have sex to show the differences in their personalities. Cronenberg is one of the best directors working today, and this is one of my favorite performances of his. A Visuals: The line between direction and visuals is always a bit ambiguous, (I only break them up because Yahoo! movies makes me assign each one a letter grade and I can't give a grade with no explanation why it's there or it becomes meaningless) and it's even more difficult to define with Cronenberg because his strong visuals are so rooted in his style, so I'm using visuals to describe the special effects in this movie. Specifically, the blood. There's lots of it. It's disgusting and yet stylized in an oddly beautiful sort of way. I know the fight sequence with the coffee carafe was done using chroma keying and the results are spectacular. The bullet entry and exit wounds are some of the most realistic I've ever seen. Also, the contrast between the simple country house that the Stall's live in and the elegant mansion in Philadelphia really does an effective job of characterizing the inhabitants for us, but also make Philadelphia and Indiana seem like completely different worlds. The visuals also get an A.Overall: I really liked this movie. It's not for everyone, particularly if excessive amounts of blood or on screen sex of any kind at all offend you. I can't see a broadcast television clean cut of this movie ever being made that doesn't completely neuter the effect of this movie. It needs the violence and the sex to work, so again, if you don't like those things then you shouldn't watch this movie, although if you are into expanding your point of view then I think maybe you should watch this one anyway because this movie makes a great case for why blood and sex should not be taken away from filmmakers on the grounds that it would negatively affect their art. To everyone else out there, see this movie! All around, I have to give this one a B. It would have been an A if the storyline had been stronger, but it's still a damn good movie. It's well worth your money.",A History of Violence
384,gvf,A Neo-Noir masterpiece all the way!,9,6 March 2006,"Personally, I never made David Cronenberg for somebody who could direct a character-driven, gripping edge-of-your-seat thriller - and least of all a Film Noir epic.But that's exactly what has been created here - a modern-day suspense thriller that has nearly all the bells and whistles of classic film noir, molded into a contemporary crime drama.Meet Tom Stall - a respectable, caring family man who owns a diner in some quiet little town in rural Indiana. On the surface, he is just the average John Doe who has never done a bad thing in his life. One day, some gunslinging villains shake up the peace and quiet of his diner; Tom just snaps and kills both of them on the spot in a dramatic self-defense stunt that briefly earns him national television fame. Just days later, a bunch of mobsters from Philadelphia show up, telling him that someone back in Philly wants to settle an old score. Tom's facade begins to crumble as it becomes more and more obvious that he has quite a past - and that he was once an East Coast mob henchman under the name of Joey Cusack...The storyline bears a striking resemblance to the classic Noir movie ""Out of the Past"" and may therefore be seen as a mere knock-off by some. But then again, what's wrong with adding a new angle to a once-great story premise? Aside from dramatic high-contrast lighting and a dark, grim and existentialist overall feel and touch, the movie employs classic Noir clichés like a main protagonist haunted by his past who is drawn into a maelstrom of cataclysmic events. The too-good-to-be-true facade of a serene, carefree rural life in Heartland America is shattered in what has often been called the ""negation of the American Dream"" - another trademark feature of classic Noir movies.""A History of Violence"" was deservedly nominated for two Academy Awards - Film Noir hasn't looked this good in color for a long time.",A History of Violence
385,lulu18,Unnerving and Unforgettable,9,7 November 2005,"This movie left me shaken on so many levels. This is the first Cronenberg movie I have actually liked and while his other films were disturbing (Videodrome, for example), to me they were off the wall. This film, however, real and brutally honest.My one qualm was that Stalls' family was too perfect. All three people come in to comfort the little girl? However, that aside, the characters were real and you can feel for them, especially for Stalls, who has tried so hard to erase his past. However, the movie says it's not possible to erase your past which seems to come back and bite you. Or for most people, anyway. The brilliance of Mortenson's performance is that you can see in his expression that just under the surface is a brute killer and then a few seconds later his ""better"" side comes to the fore.The scene where he attacks his wife first and then has brutal sex with her was truly terrifying to me. My first reaction was that he raped her and I still think part of that was true. She was actually trying to get away from him when he dragged her and then pulled her clothes to have sex with her and she then acquiesced. Is Cronenberg suggesting that women like violent sex or that sex is violent? That scene really frightened me, almost more than the other violent scenes.And is violence genetic or just beneath the surface of us all as when he son brutally assaults his bullying schoolmate after taking his insults far too long? And lastly, what sickened me was the apathy of the students watching the bullying and then watching the attack without interfering or calling the authorities.This film stuck (and still sticks with me) like glue and I'm still wrapping my head around it to sort it all out. I'm not sure whether I like myself for feeling sorry for Tom and hoping his family takes him back.But then is there hope for redemption for those who commit violent crimes? Wow!",A History of Violence
386,FordPrefect-42,"Very good, but not without its flaws",7,23 March 2008,"After a second viewing I can clearly tell what I love, and don't like about this picture. Mortensen, Harris, and Hurt are all great and Hurt would have deserved the Oscar he was nominated for. Also, Cronenberg knows how to tell this story in a way that is both thrilling and strongly emotional.The main problem I have with the film is that Maria Bello, Ashton Holmes, and Heidi Hayes are not up to the standard that the three previously mentioned actors are. Hayes' is just a little kid, so I can understand why she sounds like she's just reciting lines given to her, but I expected more from Holmes who has a much bigger role as Mortensen's son. He isn't a bad actor, but sometimes his dialog seems forced and although I can understand his emotions during a few scenes, he sometimes acts in ways contradictory to what we've seen for his character. Bello's character seems to be an uncomfortable mix of several personalities: is she a loving mother, an independent self-sufficient lawyer, or a slightly kinky wife? Sometimes her character seems dependant on her husband, and at other times she seems ready to take on whatever comes at her. Also, like Holmes character Bello has a few scenes, most notably in a hospital room where I can understand her feelings, but she just acts like a bit of a bitch towards Mortensen. Instead of trying to understand him more why she was yells and accuses him instead of trying to understand why he wanted to change his life. Oh well, perhaps these character problems are because of the script, which I feel has a few scenes that ring false and occasionally forces its characters to do things for the sake of moving the script forward.Really though, the problems I had with those three performances and the script aren't incredibly major, but they did distract me. I'm fascinated with how Cronenberg takes this film and makes everyone seemingly equally good and evil. One thing I came away with is that everyone uses violence to get what they want. The two men at the diner use it basically for money, Joey/Tom uses it to get the peaceful life he desires, Richie uses it to keep the money and power he has, Edie uses it to protect her family, the school bully uses it to feel important, and Jack uses it to get back at the school bully.",A History of Violence
387,ddn32,I can't believe this is Cronenberg's,2,2 June 2006,"As a Canadian with a lot of experience with America and American film, I expected more from David Cronenberg. While the basic premise for the movie is interesting, the execution was poor. Too many movies, like this one, feed the myth of the American heartland. It is the virtuous place with friendly neighbours and townsfolk whose idea of paradise is a slice of pie and a good cup of coffee at the local diner. Husbands are loyal and wives always know their place. You understand these characters because you have seen them countless times before. I didn't expect Cronenberg to buy into this American mythology considering his track record. Much of this movie smacks of a TV movie. Take out the stairway sex scene and the blood and gore, it is a CBS Sunday Night Movie. Where is Melissa Gilbert or Valerie Bertinelli when you need them ?",A History of Violence
388,jfurioli_2000,A History of Violent Movies...,8,27 September 2005,"So we know the story: an average Joe, loving husband, caring father, model citizen in middle America is attacked by thugs but he saves the day by defending himself and his diner when it was obvious he had no other choice and ends up killing the aggressors. He should go back to his family a hero. We have seen so many films like this one.Yet it is more complex here. When someone dies, people have to live with it. When the hero kills a bad guy, is it because he is standing his ground like anyone would or because he is a killer, unlike anyone else? Can a normal man be a hero? Can we glorify him? Or does he have to be something different, hidden beneath the surface? The movie answers this question without a hesitation and it is not the answer we are used to. Some people will love it, some will hate it. I think a lot will miss the point. It is a movie about movies parading as an action flick.The fights scene are flawless, some nervous comic relief sequences perfectly timed, the acting is brilliant especially with Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello and Ed Harris. An Academy Award of the Weird and Questionable to William Hurt who makes a pretty good impersonation of Will Ferrell (why? that is the mystery of the movie).Otherwise, a good, solid movie delivered with precision in the execution y Cronemberg.",A History of Violence
389,janqb,No Growth,6,4 November 2005,"Good storytelling but unnecessary and unpleasant gratuitous violence and sexual content. I don't know how the movie made it into the R rated category; it's too explicit at times. Even with a parent or guardian I would never allow my kids to see this movie. The sexual content was especially unpleasant as I found the protagonist and his wife repulsive.The biggest downer to the film is that in spite of it being so character driven and so reliant on the relationships of the characters with each other and with themselves the characters don't really grow as people. Viggio's character seems to show some growth, but when he states to his brother that he does love having a family and being a father the audience realizes that he has always felt this way from the start of the film. He would not have stayed so long with his wife raising the children if he did not love them and love the simple life of a small town.Because you become emotionally involved with main characters and hope the best for them, it was such a disappointment that after taking us through so many emotional ups and downs journeying through the life of a former hit-man that we are presented with an inconclusive conclusion and a wordless acceptance of the hit-man-father without justifying why he was accepted once more by his family. The complexities of a tight-knit, small town, blissfully happy family dealing with a tragic, earth-shattering betrayal by the father can't be glossed over with such a cavalier ending! It renders all the gory violence, all the graphic lovemaking, all the intensity of the main characters completely pointless at the end. The director's meanings are left disjointed and we make only the vaguest logical connections between different components of the film. I gave this film only 6 stars because it has the potential to be so much more.",A History of Violence

There is violence, there is sex, but there is something missing. Oh yes, the point.The acting by most of the cast is very good, especially Maria Bello. Ed Harris misses a beat in a few scenes but does a good job. Viggo Mortenssen though only shows the occasional signs of life. At the start when he is meant to come across as a mild-mannered family man he instead conveys the image of someone who's had a frontal lobotomy.The family scenes come across as wholly artificial though Mortenssen shares a few good exchanges with the son and Bello carries every scene she is in.The action scenes are the weakest point of the movie. The way that the gun-wielding stooges repeatedly seem to be frozen in awe as Mortenssen's character lumbers around is like some kind of running joke. In fact many scenes had me wondering if they're meant to be comedic.It is well-paced with a good turn by William Hurt to add some sense of closure but at the end of the day everyone goes home none the wiser.",A History of Violence
391,solanki17,Great script with a highly innovative storyline and believable characters played perfectly,8,9 March 2007,"Starring Vigo Mortenson fresh from his success in the LOTR trilogy, this film casts him as the lead character in a strange but pleasantly unique storyline of a man with a checkered past which finally catches up to him. Ably supported by a great cast of actors Ed Harris & Maria Bello. The film begins with the audience learning about the main characters (Tom Stall) life style and his genuine love for his family. This is all thrown upside down when Tom is thrust upon society and labelled a ""hero"" for stopping a robbery and assault happen in his restaurant. But this event causes a chain reaction resulting in people from Tom's past catching up with him. The obvious denial by Tom to his beloved family of any kind of ill past in his history is quite illuminating to watch and his constant conflict with himself and his wife are great scenes to watch (played brilliantly by Maria Bello). The movie is a definite break from the norm and well worth watching. I would highly recommend it, David Cronenberg the director is known for his unique films (Existenz, Crash, The fly) so its not a surprise this has come from his stable.",A History of Violence
392,tha_mongoose,"""Daddy...There were monsters.""",8,12 June 2010,"A History of Violence is a movie about the human animal. Tom Stall is the father in a well-to-do family of 4. Happily married for what it seems like a good 16 or so years judging by the age of their eldest son the Stall family is one that shies away from violence at every opportunity.For this reason Jack (Ashton Holmes) the high-school kid deals with the typical school bully with verbal defences as opposed to physical confrontation. Whether this approach is appropriate or not is open to debate. Personally I think the way he's being disrespected calls for fisticuffs, but some may understandably disagree.The main focus of the film, however, is the ideal of the reformed man. The concept of tabula rasa, of the possibility of erasing the past completely and starting afresh.In that sense AHOV is an optimistic movie. It certainly shows Cronenberg moving away from the type of thing he was making 20 odd years ago (Videodrome), or more recently with eXistenZ (1996).There are many likable characteristics of the film. Firstly it is simple in its layout, without any incomprehensible twists or turns. The intention of this linear plot is for the viewer to be totally focused on what is being said.Secondly every detail has a purpose. ""There is no such thing as monsters"" Tom Stall (Mortensen) tells his young daughter at the start of the movie to console her after she wakes up from a nightmare in the middle of the night.Indeed. In AHOV the message is that we can change ourselves. That being a monster is not beyond our control. Certainly when you are faced with who Stall was and who he became the scenario calls for such an interpretation.However it is important to stress the element of love in this equation. Stall himself confesses to Edie (Bello) that were it not for her he wouldn't have changed. No man is an island, and human love has the power to heal souls and cure misled hearts.One of Cronenberg's best pictures (together with Eastern Promises), with deep philosophical tenets.

So I went to the theater prepared to look at a very deep and meaningful story: well, maybe I've missed something (I always had problems with Canadian auteurs) but what I think I saw is a western taken from a comic and that's all. Well, yes, any thinking person is able to extract from the film some questions like Can A Man Change his Life? or Are you Still Responsible of what You've Done Even When You Turned Into Another Person? but still you can extract something also from Mickey Mouse.

395,svetlastoyanova,A Violence That Will Stay In History,8,5 June 2008,"Another masterpiece by David Cronnenberg I have to say. History of Violence is a realistic picture of the violence in our lives and its effects on us. Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen ) lives and works in a small town where the closest to violence you get is the bulling of his son at school and his preach about avoiding violence by any means.Another day at his Dinner café is about to finish when two hit men come in and demand coffee. Tom obeys in order to avoid people getting hurt, but when the things turn a bit nasty he easily disarms and kills both men. He turns into local hero and his picture is all over the newspapers. That however brings some dodgy looking people to his Dinner shop claiming they know him, calling him Joey.Is he or is he not who they say he is? Well you have to see the movie, it is worth it. Viggo Mortensen is absolutely outstanding in his performance, Maria Bello as a supporting act gives his character the innocence and calmness of a country life that shatters with even bigger slam when the truth comes out. The reaction of Tom's family when so close to violence is so true, so human, so confused. They don't know how to react, they are not sure what they know and who they know. You can follow their emotional trial step by step.It is true the movie is violent, but only truly harsh and vile actions could trigger the reactions that come to follow. The director also paid a lot of attention on the effect those actions have on the common people. If the violence was not so brutally portrayed, it would not be in such a contrast with the real world Cronnenberg created right beside it. Outstanding!!!",A History of Violence
396,terrors89,It's not bad.,6,1 October 2005,"***Contains Spoilers*** Sometimes movies can have a hot actress who gets naked, a good actor who is quite studly, and a bad guy who is cool in that mean sort of way, and still be crappy because of bad writing and/or story. This movie fits this description to a T.Viggo Mortensen (Lord of the Rings Trilogy) stars as every bodies All-American next door neighbor Tom Stall, who has a beautiful wife Edie, played by Maria Bello (Assault on Precinct 13,) and two great kids. He runs the neighborhood diner and everything is great until two hoodlums show up and try to kill Tom and the rest of the staff. However, with some quick thinking and brutal violence, Tom kills both of the men. Tom becomes a national hero with his name in the paper and face on TV, which happens to bring 3 men from Philadelphia, one of which is Carl Fogarty, played by Ed Harris (Apollo 13,) who claim to know Tom by another name, Joey, and what to take him back to Philadelphia, to settle some unfinished business.The cast was very strong. I enjoyed Viggo's portrayal of the anti-hero that his character became. He also did a good job in the beginning of the movie showing glimpses of Joey, while being Tom, and at the end of the movie when the rolls were reversed. Maria Bello was also quite nice as the small town wife who was an angel during the day and a sex puppet at night. She has created one of the top ten sexiest scenes in movie history by coming out of the bathroom in a cheerleader outfit, portraying a ""sweet, innocent"" girl who is very naughty as she rubs her skirt and revealing her very white, pure panties. Very Sexy! She also did a nice job acting, a role that reminded me of her performance in the movie Payback.Ed Harris was quite intriguing as the mob boss Carl Fogarty. His performance was just menacing enough to provide some real thrilling moments, particularly the scene at the mall that could have been over the top but Harris kept it right on. Giving his character a physical deformity was a nice touch that was one of the few decisions the writer or director made.Earlier, I mentioned how Maria Bello's performance was similar to the one in Payback, which also starred Mel Gibson. The entire movie actually reminded me of the same movie, mostly because of the good guy image each leading actor had, and turning it around to play the bad guy. However, the stark difference between the two movies is that in Payback there was a rise in tension from beginning until the climatic final scene. In A History of Violence, the tension is jump started in the beginning scene when we are introduced to the two hoodlums, then we are allowed a reprieve while we get to no the Tom Stall character, and the tension is re-introduced with reappearance of the hoodlums. However, from this point on the tension never rises or falls, which is both good and bad. Screenwriter Josh Olson adapted the story from the graphic novel written by Josh Wagner and Vince Locke. The story is the week point and I don't know who to blame. My biggest problem is that, to me, there was no climatic scene. At no point did I feel the tension rise as Tom/Joey confronted his nemesis. The tension was steady, which was nice because there were scenes that involved Tom's son in a fight at school that really had nothing to do with the main story. But when Tom/Joey final confronts the men, instead of a long shootout or some decent action, it was a quick, bang, bang, bang, bad guys dead. Which is probably what would happens in real life, at least the quickness of the fight, but totally not exhilarating nor something I want to see at the movies, If I want reality, I will watch the news. I wanted to be on the edge of my seat and I wasn't.The there is the ending. After Tom confronts the bad guy and tells Edie who he really is, he gets a call from his brother and is forced to go back to Philadelphia and confront him. His brother, Richie, played horribly by William Hurt (The Village,) is a mobster who was screwed over by his younger brother when Joey was still with the mob, I think. It is never really explained. Anyway, the tension is still maintained because I was expecting a huge shoot out or something, of course this was before I new who was his brother. Once Hurt stumbled onto the screen, you could have phoned the movie in. More bang, bang, bang, bad guys dead.I will say that the final scene redeemed itself if I read into the expression Maria Bello gave him when he came back from this rampage. If, the look meant the opposite of what they talked about in the first part of the movie, then it was a perfect ending, if it meant the same, then I am even more upset. It is hard to talk about without completely giving it away, which I have already done so much I don't want to do anymore.I also have to say the sex scene in the hallway doesn't make sense to me and if someone will explain it to me I will appreciate it.Overall, I like this movie, but for the actors and not for the story. It will find its way into my video collection but probably at a discounted price, if for nothing else to have a Maria Bello full frontal nudity shot in the collection. ***This review and others can be read at www.bbmc.dockratent.com***",A History of Violence
397,whitakeroh,Over-the-top trash,2,31 January 2006,"I saw this movie with high hopes. I thought Vigo would display his dramatic, violent, masculine side. Instead he comes out in this movie like a little kid in his elementary school play. This movie has a decent premise, guy changes life to fit into smalltown USA and raises family. Bad guys come looking for him years later, all hell breaks loose. Sounds good, right? Wrong.This movie tried to become something its not, first, everyone was miscast. Viggo's acting was, quite honestly, horrendous. I'm no New York Drama teacher, but watching this you see over-the-top detached emotion. Maria bello is supposed to be a ""small town girl""? I don't think so. The gratuitous sex scenes just were not needed. I know that this Cronenberg has a reputation. But please, I don't see how, in any way, the sex scenes did anything for the film, if anything, they took away from the film. If I were the director of this film, I would have dived into the personality struggle that ""Joey"" was possibly under. I know thats the big surprise. ""wow hes really joey!"" but when that realization came I was sort of angry, I mean, tell us earlier then have some more detail built into his character. Also, the movie is a history of violence, but really, there is not much violence in this movie, what it is, is that the violence that does occur is in your face violence which really wasn't that bad. But I wanted more of viggo whooping up.And instead of turning him into a Martial arts, navy seal commando as cronenberg tried to do, just keep it simple, make him lethal b/c he has a meanness in him. That bothered me, was the director suppose to convince us that viggo was Jet Li? Lastly, Ed Harris should have had a larger part, and a better part. This movie had vast potential, but the potential was cut off due to an extremism that failed. This movie is barely worth the cost of renting a DVD.",A History of Violence
398,ArArArchStanton,It started out as a good idea,4,27 March 2006,"I wanted to see this movie so bad. I'm not a huge vigo fan, but he definitely deserves a chance to be a mainstay actor, so I've watched the movies he's released since the Rings's movies.The premise of this movie is good. It intends to relate the common human experience to the nature of violence and how we perceive it in contemporary society.The first 30 minutes of this film do just that. We see Tom (Vigo) as a common small town middle class man, who works hard to maintain a small but popular diner amongst the locals. He has a standard American family, and overall he is just what everybody in America would like to be. He has a great life.Then tragedy stikes him, but he comes out on the good end. He is shaken by an attempted robbery on his diner, which he thwarts by leaping into heroic action, whereby he kills the assailants.This event happen in the first 20 minutes of the film, and undoubtedly, this is the climax of the film. From here, Tom and his family try to reconcile the traumatic events, but when Harris's character arrives to insinutate that Tom isn't who he says he is, the intent of the movie is washed away when Tom reveals that he actually isn't who he says he was.From here on out the movie completely removes itself from the guiding principle of peaceful man vs. violence, and instead embraces the violence outright. With seemingly no emotion one way or the other, Tom commits one violent act after another. An oddly placed sex seen in which tom and his loving wife beat each other before getting it on gives way to greusome death scenes which are symbolic of the films move from principle to imagery.What they wanted to do, was show that Tom could not escape his past, but what is left out, is why Tom left that past exactly in the first place, whether or not he was multiple personality or just a good liar, why his wife took him back in the end, why he showed no signs of knowing who Ed Harris's character was until much later, and even then to no dramatic effect, and several other details.The movie just simply falls thin of it's own intent, as though the writer/director, became more intranced with the gore effects than concentrating on the overall movement of the story.Even the ""climactic"" seen with his brother, which is horrifically acted, shows no sign of emotion, and in the end we know very little about the circumstance surrounding Tom and his mob roots. Who was he? Why was he doing all this? How did he get good at fighting? We simply do not know. So much more could have been put into this film that had so much promise. Somebody should take this idea and run in a new direction with it. It really is a good concept.",A History of Violence
399,guillermotorofan,A disturbing examination of violence...,8,22 July 2006,"I was personally thrown off by A History Of Violence. Partly due to it's great reputation, and partly due to it's stunning and unexpected simplicity. In this day and age I expected anything but a simple plot. Something clichéd. A predictable plot. Poor acting. ANYTHING but a simple plot that doesn't try to surprise.Acting: 10/10 This is one of the rare films with a cast without a single bad actor. Viggo Mortensen gives a great performance as Tom Stall, the man with a past. No Oscar given, no Oscar earned, but still a notable performance. The same goes for the lovely Maria Bello. She does well as the wife who must deal with the fact that her husband may not be the same husband she married. Not your everyday role, or performance. Ed Harris gives one of my favorite performances in the film as the icy hit-man Carl Fogarty. He pulls of a menace in a very unique way. The sight of his cold stare from Carl Fogarty's damaged eye (""Barbed wire, wasn't it?"") chills the spine. Then very quickly, the mighty John Hurt, comes in and out in but a few minutes. Much like the flavor of chewing gum, it is there and orgasmically good, then it's gone. His role was (in my opinion) a bit too short for an Oscar nomination as Supporting Actor, but definitely worthy of the prestigious award.Writing: 7/10 The writing is a tad TOO simple for comfort, and the largest portion of the work for this film comes from David Cronenberg. Again, I think it was an Oscar nomination not quite earned, but it could have gone to the writers of ALONE IN THE DARK, so I have no room to complain. Directing: 8/10Cronenberg gives a masterful helm to this project, but will still go down with The Fly as the alpha male of resume. This film is directed with a rare and intense realism, that holds more fright than the intestine eating likes of THE HILLS HAVE EYES. He won't go down in history like Francis Ford Coppola for his GODFATHER, or Spielberg with SCHINDLER'S LIST, but this if a eerie film that he should be commended for.Effects: 10/10 Not a single shot of CGI to be seen, but some fantastic make-up effects for the scenes of splatter. This leaves me no room to critique, so I have no choice but to award it a 10.Score:5/10 When I said SIMPLE, I meant SIMPLE. Like everything in this film, it is downsized. A prominent score is not needed, but what is there is not memorable. Not frightening or moving. Cinematography:7/10 Simple film, simple shots. Not much to see here.Final Diagnosis: B",A History of Violence
400,dvdguy2005,Mr. Black's Grade: A-,8,5 October 2005,"A History of Violence Mr. Black's Grade: A- Directed by David Cronenberg , and starring: Ed Harris, Maria Bello, Viggo Mortensen, and William Hurt.Before anything I have to explain... there is some serious crush action at my end for the lovely and talented Maria Bello. There is just something about the lady that I find terribly attractive. This movie is no disappointment there, lets just say: Maria in a cheerleader outfit! Enough ink on my infatuations, time for the film itself.A History of Violence certainly lives up to its name. It is no Scanners, or anything along those lines, but there are short bursts of intense violence. Viggo Mortensen's character begins the film living an idyllic life in small town USA (maybe a little too tranquil for me). I do not want to go into the plot very much, but let's just say that this peaceful life goes through some serious changes. Maria Bello is great (naturally), Ed Harris is quite menacing and William Hurt has a scene that is quite brilliant. The crowd was clapping and laughing the whole time he was on the screen! It is a 'clean', exceptionally well crafted piece of work. Please remember that this is a David Cronenberg production, so there are a few moments that will certainly shock you. That is OK, go along for the ride - this is a very, very good film.",A History of Violence
401,Erick-12,Auteur or bumbler? Both.,6,7 February 2007,"I'm tired of picking on poor Cronenberg, but certainly he's problematic. Brags about wanting to make a commercial film this time. It is watchable, and certainly more thoughtful than some, but it fails to rise very far above the average fare today. A revenge plot, family man saves his family, becomes local town hero. The interesting bit is that he learned his deadly fighting skill from his criminal past, member of the mob. Though he's tried to go straight and peaceful, he's pulled back in and forced to defend himself. This film could raise the question of justifiably violent men defending the normal way of lifesince he's was a gangster. Allegorically, this theme wonders where to draw the line between ""da Family"" and the family, between gangs and communities. But that question is too dubious and/ or too vaguely formed here. The audience in fact is not encouraged to pursue it once it potentially appears  in the form of his wife angrily leaving him because he'd lied about his past all these years, only to be violently raped on the stairs by him. If one has a history of violence, can you truly reform? That seems to be Cronenberg's line of thought. Not very deep.",A History of Violence
402,roset60,"Not complex, poor acting, boring",1,1 October 2005,"This was a very slow moving picture, and some of the acting was really poor (the male lead, the little girl, the wife, the gay son). William Hurt was great, but only had a small part in the movie. Some of the bad guys were fine too. The supposedly deep loving relationship between husband and wife never got off the ground for me, in spite of the hot sex they didn't appear to have any chemistry. The son's problems, relationship with his Dad were artificial, not credible. Most of the 'acting' consisted of anguished facial expressions. The little girl was terrible, but she was given poorly written dialog so maybe for that she should be given some slack (compare her performance to the irritating but well acted little girl in War of the Worlds). I went to see this movie because of a five star rating in a review in the local newspaper. What a mistake!",A History of Violence
403,jeremy-liebster,Passes the time.... but a good film? Don't be silly!,3,4 April 2006,"It does irritate me on this database when people who like a film with lots of sex and violence claim that those who don't like the film can't deal with sex and violence. Now I have to say I love sex and violence and all in all the more I see in a film the better but I still didn't think that this film was any good (though the sex scenes were admittedly quite fun!). Don't get me wrong - it works as a perfectly entertaining mindless DVD rental on a Monday evening - but as a quality drama - you have to be joking. Let me first say however that the film started well. I enjoyed the buildup of tension, the slow realisation that Tom Stalls was not who he seemed, but then the film fell away and became silly. The fight scenes were preposterous which is fine in a martial arts film, but in a supposedly 'thinking man's drama' such as this one just appear very out of place. What is more the mob members are so absurdly clichéd in their accents, dialogue, even down to their black BMW with darkened windows that they cannot be taken in any way seriously. At some points towards the end the film seemed to almost descend into comedy which I am sure was not what the writer intended and as for that final scene around the dinner table when the little girl set her daddy's place for him while his eyes went all teary - the word nauseating doesn't even begin to do it justice. This film did have potential, but a crass second half really spoiled it for me.",A History of Violence
404,theoscillator_13,Absolutely brilliant...One of Cronenberg's best!,10,23 January 2006,"*minor minor spoiler at end* I don't know what to say about this film to really express what it made me feel. Before seeing the movie , I had gotten mixed reviews from people. Some people hated it and even told me they wanted to walk out on it. Some people liked it but nobody really raved about it, not even my roommate who is a hardcore Cronenberg fan. I don't remember the last movie that I saw that affected me so much. I really haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I saw it. I go as far as to say it was the best Cronenberg movie I have ever seen, even toping Dead Ringers which I never thought was possible.At the core this is just a perfect examination of the human psyche. What makes us who we are and can we ever change our primal instincts? Mortensen and Harris were incredible but the 10 or so minutes of screen time by William Hurt at the end of the movie really stole the film for me as far as acting performances go.This is a rare film that can both be slow, methodical and thoughtfull and be ultra violent, gory and brutal at the same time. And the bottom line is that this is not your average Hollywood movie. Where Hollywood wants to give you something easy to digest, Cronenberg wants to give something that is difficult to look at and makes you want to vomit it back up.The last scene says it all. Cronenberg's take on the happy ending. Tom returns, nobody says a word but they welcome him back to his spot at the family dinner table as if nothing has changed but it will never be the same.",A History of Violence

407,JohnnyNoGood,Very Different,9,4 October 2005,"I found this film to be different from what I or anybody would come to expect from modern dramatic films. By now, everyone knows the premise so I'll jump right into the critique. ""A History of Violence"" wasn't quite what I expected and for that I can appreciate it better. It took a very unconventional way to tell the basic story and never took turns that I expected. The main characters were realistically flawed and there were many scenes in the film that made the audience uncomfortable, which was necessary and intentional. Graphic violence and sexual situations were blades at the bottom of a seemingly straight-forward drama. The film had some excellent performances by both Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen, but the sub-characters such at the two children were terrible. I never bought the little girl's performance one bit! And much of the dialogue was rather bland, but Ed Harris more than made up for the sub-par juvenile acting and blank script. The film made the audience do a lot of work to decipher what it was saying and how it was saying it. I found it's message to be profound and meaningful, but anyone looking for a straight-forward thriller/drama should look elsewhere.

First, I must say that the two major sex scenes in this picture were fabulous - very passionate and erotic. Later on in the movie, William Hurt makes an appearance as a mobster, and I must say that I laughed out loud at some of his lines, even though he was a very threatening character. That's one of the things I really liked about this picture -it's weirdly funny in parts, and terribly scary in others. It was not at all what I expected, and I really was engaged all throughout the picture. Not formulaic, not predictable.

409,travisyoung,An unflinching manifesto,7,27 November 2007,"A placid mid-western family becomes inherently dysfunctional - even sadistic - when violence from both the past and present invades their disgustingly peaceful lives. Actually, words like ""placid"" and ""peaceful"" are too kind...everyone in this movie seems heavily medicated 90% of the time! Possibly the most sedate is Mortensen, who when armed with Wrangler jeans, a broken-down pickup and a bad haircut convincingly plays Tom Stall, the subdued owner of a local diner in a sleepy, rural town. And it works, because everything about this movie is vaguely lethargic. In fact, if the film were any less flat or (let's face it) slow, it simply wouldn't be believable. It's not boring - it's just not Hollywood either.True to form, director Cronenberg uses special effects sparingly yet with startling results, to illustrate the topic, not the story. The cinematography is visually mesmerizing, beautifully filmed with the deep, murky shadows of a Vermeer painting. Bello gives her best performance to date as the concerned wife/mother, and the entire Stall family evokes nothing but realism when seemingly ordinary people find themselves in extraordinary circumstances. On the other hand, all the other characters are cold caricatures, vivid exaggerations that feel completely out of place within the framework of the film.But right there lays the balance - a perfectly harmonized composition of intrinsically flawed elements. For example, a large portion of the third act is so clichéd and unimaginative that, were it not for the speechless power and sheer intensity of the final scene, the whole film would collapse under its own pretension.You may have noticed...I'm not going to share any of the large details of the plot, because the narrative is not what the film is attempting to communicate. Having watched it several times, I puzzled at what the movie really accomplishes: It's not a drama, because although you desperately want to know what happens, you couldn't possibly care when it does. It isn't a fable...there is no moral of the story. It certainly could not be called a character study - yet it is the relationships of the Stall family that perfectly illustrate what can only be described as a commentary on violence.Movies like this really aren't made anymore, and so it is remarkable how Cronenberg wields passion and induces deep thought in what is for all intents and purposes a sparse film in many respects. It is reminiscent of the New Hollywood film renaissance that took place in the late sixties and through the seventies, movies that simultaneously inspired and demoralized, revolted and delighted. Whether you will consider ""A History of Violence"" a bore or a thriller, trash or a masterpiece, it is undeniably a manifesto against violence that unflinchingly demands your full attention.",A History of Violence
410,jeff-coatney,Brilliantly Sub-Textural,8,9 October 2005,"I felt as if I was watching a documentary about how higher primates relate to each other. Most people are going to judge this film at face value. Look past the plot points and the characterizations and the brilliantly graphic violence and sexuality and you get to see the real History of Violence. This film explores how humans relate to each other using violence. We build intimacies, define how we love each other, create the social fabric we live within, all by using violence at every stage of life as a central and according to the point of view of the film, an essential tool to assert our power and dominance, protect what we value and connect to our sexuality. This film shows us the history of violence through the situations the characters face from adolescence all the way to a showdown for utter survival. Along the way, we see how violence emanates from all humans naturally and freely and may even be as essential to our survival as a species. There are many very eloquent moments in the film when we are surprised intellectually by how the characters react, yet those moments ring true instinctively. Maria Bello's character is tormented and repelled by the revelations from Viggo Mortensen's character, yet in the middle of their fight, she becomes aroused sexually. It's clear that in her character's mind, the primate part of herself betrayed the intellectual side of her being and that both satisfies and disgusts her. The complexities layer one upon the other in such a way that when the very realistic violence occurs, it heightens the effect in the most unglamorous way. Essential viewing for anyone interested in human behavior.",A History of Violence

Viggo Mortensen plays a quiet unassuming family man in small town Ohio. When two killers come to his diner attempting to rob and terrorize the patrons Mortensen kills them and becomes a media hero. This brings another set of men to town, gangsters led by Ed Harris who claim that Mortensen is a man who they knew as ""Joey"". This is the driving tension of the film and Cronenberg handles it very well. A film like this could easily degenerate into melodramatic cheese but Cronenberg finds the right balance of psychological tension and action. The action IS somewhat over the top and fairly graphic, but this is intentional. The action-hero nature of how Mortensen kills the men leaves us, and his friends and family, wondering if he really is this dangerous gangster ""Joey"". In the end this film is about the consequences of lies and violence on a family, and the possibility of personal redemption. There are a lot of nice touches in here. Mortensen and Bello are portrayed as a loving couple with, unusually in film, a healthy sex life. We have complex emotions from a wife who may not really know who her husband is. Cronenberg also hints at the story behind ""Joey"" but never fully fills us in, artfully letting our imaginations fill in the story. Even the last action scene, which skirts the edge of being too campy, manages to work within the film.

They lool like the perfect family. Some very odd scenes come up for us to see how perfectly balanced just nornal family, like the scene of the girls nightmare, where the whole family end up in her bed saying that there are no monsters. Than we dont know if the guys from the motel end up in Sam's dinner by chance, because its not the money they after of, or are they crazed murderes that roam around? Or are they already part of Sam's old life. They were not because Sam' problems begin because he is portrayed as hero in the news after killing the motel men.
So Sam's guys from his old life comes to get him, because we assume he ran from killer life. . They have an odd approach to Sam/Joey. They show up in the dinner they put on a show, then they show at a mall where Sam's wife with the daughter. One would expect that those bad guys would have led with the situation in a quiet and silenced mode. You know not to let the sherriff know that you're there to get and kill Sam. At the third visit they decide to strike and try to kill him. Again Sam/Joey show they hitman skills and kills 3 of them (maybe it was just 2, doesn' matter. The main bad guy, Ed Harris caracter is killed by Sam's son (that from being a weak guy all his life, now that he knows his dad knows killer things, is violent himself now, beating his bullyer at school with some ninja kind of way). All these killing in Sam' front yard, but there""s no fuss from the press now, we see no cops, nothing, we just see Sam alone in a hospital bed. So now Sam's family know the truth about his killer old days. The sherriff comes to the house in q casual visit because things dont add up. They dont, really. Then other men from the old days come and this time take him, only to be in a big house and Sam/Joey kills them all and goes back to being Sam again.
And thats about it this movie. And above all was the very odd behaviours. Like the motel guys ending up at Sam's diner to do just evil, they dont want money, because, as Sam says, they deal with not so much cash and wants do give it to them, they dont care, they're there to the devils work. Very odd. Or the acene when comes out of the hospital as a hero and when they to the house there is one, just one, reporter with a cameraman. She does the typical reporter scene, running up to Sam and shoving the mic to his mouth through the half closed car window. Sam manages to leave the car and she chases him trying to get some words. Well, that kind of reporter behaviour occurs when there are other reporteres. This one was alone. She could have talked off the record calmy with Sam convince him just to say some words. No shoving needed.

416,footzie,Wrong plot line,6,3 October 2005,"I was anxious to see this film because the reviews had generally been good.It could have been an examination of the disruption that can come to someone's life when sudden fame is thrust upon them. But, this would hardly be fodder for Cronenberg. Instead, after a very fine opening part, the film degenerates into a virtual comic strip. Mortensen is the ""man of steel"" without the cape. He certainly establishes that he can act out of the ""Ring"" cycle. Mara Bello is the much deceived wife. She is wonderful to look at and strikes all the right notes. She fascinates in the same way as does Diane Lane. Ed Harris does a sort of cameo role as a nasty piece of work and plays it very broadly. The same is the case with William Hurt, who can and has done better. He is totally over the top in a role that Christopher Walken would have waltzed through with quiet menace.Back to the exploding tomato heads, David.",A History of Violence

I've been waiting months for this movie and at the end I was totally satisfied...this is one of Cronenberg finest, he shows here that his ability to crawl under one's skin is not common to every director on the scene. To the most interested viewers: I suggest more than one view to discover and fully understand all the psychological finesses hidden into the script and the lead-acting, and then you'll fully enjoy this voyage into people's mind, masterfully built and beautifully orchestrated by an artist at his top who's gonna show you that everybody has something to hide, in an unusual accessible way.

It reminded me of some of the great Lee Marvin, Steve McQueen and Paul Newman gangster classics. Many of the scenes were memorial, the casting was brilliant and the acting over-all was great. The only weakness I noted was in character development. The character development reminded me of my mother's eggs "" Eatable, just a little over done around the edges."" The real hidden jewels of the film were the acting by Maria Bellow and the obvious genius of William Hurt (I always recall his characters, such a gifted actor). My favorite scene was the love-hate scene that took place between Viggo Mortensen and Maria Bellow on the stairs. I found this movie to be very enjoyable.",A History of Violence
419,joeydean61869,"Cronenberg's History in top form, unlike his history",8,10 December 2006,"***1/2 out of **** starsA History of Violence is a film about identity, and not only for one man. It's about the identifying glue that holds a family together, and the precarious absolution that may urge them into the future.David Cronenberg's movie begins with the aftermath of bloodshed. Two cold-blooded criminals have murdered innocent merchants for no other reason than to loot their belongings for survival. We quickly learn their experience with violence has long since mutated their sensibilities into a state of apathy. Suddenly we're thrust into the life of Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen), a diner owner in a tiny Indiana town. He's a loving husband with a loving wife (Maria Bello), and a father of a young girl and a teenage son. The film now illustrates an ""everyday man"" protagonist we've seen time and time again, but he has our strict attention because there's an atmosphere of impending doom: the two Criminals. Cronenberg has thus far succeeded in making us feel uncomfortable by a simple formula for conflict. We now like Tom and his seemingly perfect family very much and we hate the men we know he'll soon meet. The movie's set for us...we think. One night as Tom's about to close up the diner, the cowards walk in armed and money's not enough, they've also come for blood. After Tom's initial diplomacy fails, he deftly turns the cards on them with guns blazing and offs them both, saving the lives of others. The media quickly tries to immortalize him as a hero, and he's shown on National television, but he humbly wants to be left in peace with his loving family, passing off his bravery as something anyone would do, which makes us like him even more. Then one day at the diner in walks Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris) and a couple of his goons. Behind dark sunglasses and a badly scarred face, Carl talks to Tom as a man he knows as Joey. Something violent has happened to Carl and a man named Richie in Philadelphia, and Joey, Carl claims, has everything to do with it.Carl's allegation turns out to be true. Tom was once a man named Joey and he's been keeping it a secret for over two decades. He has changed his persona so utterly that he has most likely omitted Joey rather than he has abandoned him. Tom has vacated his former existence, but his innate dexterity as a killer is just as it once was.I believe whoever didn't think A History of Violence was an excellent tale possibly missed its intention to continuously, intriguingly and genetically link Tom/Joey with his wife and son. Before Tom's former identity is revealed, there's a love making sequence between Tom and his wife Edie that is so erotically honest, it should stand as an example for other film makers to follow when they're tempted to shoot a sex scene that would make a married couple already bored with each other after their wedding night. Edie surprises Tom with a role playing game, which I believe is a testament to her incognizant attraction to his true self. She doesn't know who or what he really is - even though she's ""known"" him for many years - yet she indirectly becomes what he really is within their rapture. Tom's son Jack (Ashton Holmes) demonstrates the identical tact and physical dexterity as his father while trying to subjugate bullies. Jack's difficulty with his tormentors makes for a fascinating and cohesive subplot. He has Joey in his blood, and he's helped to realize just how much when Joey comes to light.It could be argued that the revengeful attempts on Joey's life could have been easily consummated with, let's say, a spray of automatic gunfire or a stealthy shot to the back of the head, but would Joey learn his lesson about loyalty with such a quick death? And let's not forget a destroyed narrative. The horrible men from his past want much more than a fallen body, they want profound reconciliation because of 20 years of silence.I watched an interview with Scorcese several years ago where he was asked about his graphic, unpretending approach to violence. He knew no other way to present it, he said, than for what he thought it would really look like. This is the method Cronenberg uses in History. As the violence is in the manner of Scorcese, so the tension is in the tradition of Kubrick. Cronenberg's use of withdrawn characters who somehow seem insensible and sinister, reminded me of an ingredient used in films like The Shining and Eyes Wide Shut. Something's wrong with the ambiance, but we're not sure what it is.This is by far Cronenberg's finest movie. It's an arresting character study that branches off to an immediate family where the power of forgiveness is in question. Can Tom's secret be exonerated by those who love him? Perhaps, but the price will be astronomical.",A History of Violence
420,ennyman,Gripping? Defies description? If you don't think too much...,5,31 December 2006,"Having just recently seen Spider, and having loved Crash, I was expecting another remarkable Cronenberg film, especially with such a gripping trailer. The film is technically well done and the set up well conceived. Initially it appears to be a movie not unlike one of Hollywood's favorite motifs: innocent good guy minding his own business gets tangled up with bad guys that threaten his life or his family, etc. Cape Fear, Witness, Rear Window, Marathon Man and some other films come to mind. But then the story unfolds and we quickly recognize that Viggo is not so innocent, that he does have a past, and the film switches to Hollywood's second favorite theme: ""Man with a Dark Past that comes back to haunt him.""In point of fact there are a finite number of motifs in story telling and there is no harm in this, per se. The treatment is what makes it work or fail. History of Violence disappoints.The sex scenes were unnecessary, as several people have cited. But that is not what makes the film a problem. The school bully story line was interesting to a point but got old. THE REAL PROBLEM with the film is that it did not make sense that his wife would not know anything about his past. I can't imagine living with someone for fifteen or twenty years and not having some kind of clue that there is a 25 year gap in their life story. This kind of story is supposed to be believable but for me it was inconceivable. The first sex scene begins with Maria Bello in a cheerleader outfit saying, ""This is to make up for not having been teenagers together."" OK, so I figure they came from different places, but at least there was a PLACE he came from. How could there not be any discussion about this in his whole married life? In our house we constantly discuss the impact of family dynamics on our development, and places we have been or impact of events. The absence of details would one day be a clue to something, wouldn't it? The acting was good... Maria Bello and Viggo were well cast for their roles, but the raving praise of critics on this film is inexplicable to me. I think Ed Harris is always interesting, and I like seeing William Hurt again(even if the role was cliché/caricature.) The first heroic violence by Viggo is laudable, but when he nails the Ed Harris team and then the entire clan, well, it is too much. (and where were the maids?) Too many holes in this story. I associate Cronenberg with Art, but it looks to me like this was made for the masses to make money. OK for that, I suppose, but not a true great.",A History of Violence

This film seemed to suffer from an identity crisis: When it ended, I could not decide if it was an action, a thriller or a drama. Not being able to pigeon hole a movie into a category can be a very good thing but not to the extent that this film leaves the viewer completely unsatisfied in each of the genres that it attempts to fill.So, I'm left thinking it is either a weak action film, a weak drama or a weak thriller.I am glad I watched it, I did enjoy it a little, which is why I have rated it at a 6.",A History of Violence

423,almonetts,"A fiercely intense, thought-provoking, drama which questions the notion of violence",10,5 October 2005,"Directed by David Cronenberg and starring Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello, Ed Harris, William Hurt and Ashton Holmes. Based on the graphic novel by Jack Wagner and Vince Locke.First up, I am a Cronenberg fan. His films, as well as those of David Lynch, have always held a unique distinction in my mind due to a combination of resulting reactions (on my part) after viewing them. These reactions are usually rooted in perplexity, inspiration and outright distress. For each of his films I have disliked (""Existenz"", ""Camera""), I have loved at least two others (""Spider"", ""Crash"", ""The Fly"", ""Scanners"", ""The Dead Zone""), which is not a bad ratio, come to think of it. ""A History of Violence"" centers on the Stall family who live in Middlebrook, Indiana. They are a picture perfect family in an equally idyllic town, where everyone looks out for one another. This serenity is shattered by a seemingly random act of violence, which turns Mortensen's character into a local celebrity. He is a reluctant hero, shying away from all the publicity, seeking the solace and retreat of his family. A series of events, each with tremendous subtext, unfold with ferocity. The relative composure afforded by calm of the town and the peacefulness of the perfect family becomes undone as Mortensen questions a startling revelation. The reactions (of himself, his family and community) serve as compelling parables for modern times. It is here that the film truly shines, posing several pervasive questions: Does violence breed violence? How easy has it become for us to accept violence? Do we as a society have a predisposition to violence as a means to reach a solution? Cronenberg is sensational in the way he presents the above theses. Blending gruesome imagery with a pointed matter-of-fact sensibility, witty dialogue and slow purposeful camera work, grounds each actor with the material and creates a high-caliber uniformity in performance. Each scene holds a tremendous sense of foreboding, but not a single frame is unplaced or wasted. There are a few alarming moments (which I will not share), but the compelling narrative and the consistently overwhelming performances throughout are riveting yet excruciating to behold. Mortensen is nuanced, commanding, conflicted and terrifying. Bello is sexy, strong and a beautiful mess. Their scenes together are touching, powerful, emotionally raw and intense. The transition in the relationship of Mortensen and Holmes (his son) is exceptional and Holmes has a bright future ahead of him. Ed Harris is scary, vicious and cynical. He should find company in the Best Supporting Actor category come Oscar time, as William Hurt's performance elevates the film even further. While I would love to say more, I will leave it at that. His character is callous, ruthless and his performance reverberates on screen. As the film drew to a close I was not yet fully aware of its impact, until the brilliantly masterminded and constructed final scene, which juxtaposed the central themes against your own closely held ideals/morals. Thus far, I believe it to be the Best Picture of 2005. Oscar nominations for Best Actor, Actress, Supporting Actors (Harris and Hurt), Cinematography, Adapted Screenplay, Director and Picture are expected.",A History of Violence

From the point Tom becomes a media celebrity the plot goes downhill fast. Almost everything that goes on after that is just plain silly. If all Richie Cusack wanted was his brother dead then all of Fogarty's cruising around, acting sinister, was a waste of time: mostly my time. The best scenes in the movie, besides the café, involve Tom's son dealing with a bully - good job by young actors. By dealing with the café robbers, Tom became not only a celebrity but someone who the townsfolk would see in an entirely different way.

428,s_cadzow,Highly Disappointing.,4,9 April 2006,"A History of Violence was to me, like many others in 2005, a highly anticipated movie. Now for me, it was not for any set particular reason. I do not care one way or another for David Cronenberg and none of the cast, with the exception of Ed Harris, hold a special place in my cinematic heart. I wanted to see it, because it simply looked like a solid and intelligent film. I was wrong. Quite wrong.A History of Violence follows our lead ""hero,"" if you can even call him that, Tom Stall A.K.A Joey, played by Viggo Mortensen. Joey is a simple man, leading a simple yet happy life with his wife and two kids in a small Indiana town. One day, when his restaurant falls victim to an attempted hold up by two thugs, Tom surprisingly and savagely takes them out, saving the day.Well, the red flags start to pop up, and Tom is paid a visit by some even better dressed thugs, who know him by the ""mysterious"" name of Joey. After playing the typical ""You don't know me, I don't know you, I want to just live my life, I don't want no trouble"" game with the thugs for ½ the movie, the plot, or what you can make of it, starts to finally move.As I describe the plot of AHoV, I can't help but immediately jump right in to how irrelevant and unimportant it is. The first 15-20 minutes of the film, we follow these thugs who apparently play an important role, as we build our suspicions and take our sides. And then bam, they die. Enter new thugs. OK, now we start all over again, and before we can get to understand them, bam, they die. OK, now what. The fact that there is no set ""bad guy"" in this film is par for the fact that there is no real ""good guy either,"" I guess, if you want to credit the film enough to try and make sense of it.Tom Stall, or Joey, as we later find out was his past mobster name back in his Phillie days, is such a ridiculous concept, that there is no warrant in siding for or against him, and not enough substance to even care. We take a man who used to be one bad man, a killer, whose wrong deeds finally catch up with him, and we are supposed to feel sorry for him? That doesn't work, and it doesn't work because Cronenberg gives the audience absolutely no prologue to Carl Fogarty's (Ed Harris) entrance. Was Tom justified in his actions? What actually happened? For all we know Carl is in the right, and Tom does deserve to die, I mean, after all, I personally thought Carl Fogarty was portrayed as the more calm, collected, and intelligent of the two.Another major problem I had with AHoV was the incoherent attempt at some kind of formulaic plot by David Cronenberg. The side stories of his picked on son and sexually charged wife are not only unimportant, but also irritating. The embarrassing performance of Tom's son, Jack, and his overcoming of the school bully in no way furthers our understanding of the actions in the film, and is forgotten within the film as fast as it whipped by.And as for the sex scenes, all I can ask is why? Why oh why did Cronenberg see it necessary enough to take away from the already limited time that he obviously spent on the main story, to waste time on these horrendously played out and emotionally void scenes. We all know where to go if we wanted to see embarrassing, pointless and emotionless sex, and a David Cronenberg film is not where id expect to find it.However, after all of that, the worst of AHoV is still to come. The end confrontation, the climax, the battle of the ""good vs. bad."" How are we as an audience expected to care about the final confrontation between two characters that we know nothing about? How the hell did we even get to this point? The film simply doesn't come together at all.I really had no doubt before going into AHoV that I was going to like it, it looked that good to me. However, this film ended up ranking right next to Crash winning Best Picture as one of the biggest disappointments of 2005 to me. I honestly cannot come up with a single good reason, other than another consistently solid performance by Ed Harris, why anyone should bother seeing this film.",A History of Violence
429,El_Farmerino_Esq,"Genre Thriller, Cronenberg Style",8,13 March 2006,"Ostensibly, the plot of A History of Violence is remarkably 'normal' for a Cronenberg film, following the well-worn model of 'violent incident uncovers a seemingly ordinary man's hidden past'... Indeed, on the surface it's probably the most specifically generic movie he's made since The Fly. However, as with that movie previously, what set it apart is Cronenberg's mode of presentation...Firstly, and as a potential warning, A History of Violence is BRUTAL. It's representation of cinematic violence has a similar surreal, hard-to-stomach nature to it as that of David Lynch's Wild At Heart, and it induces much the same effect. No glossy Hollywood violence here - flesh gapes out of facial bullet wounds, noses are reduced to wet masses of pulp and bone, windpipes are sickeningly crushed underfoot... It's not a film for the faint-hearted, but it is an extraordinary riposte to the casual, airbrushed way in which violence is treated in much of contemporary cinema. This is a film where the audience feels every punch and is invited to test the limits of how much they can stomach. And, while not as shocking as, say, Noe's Irreversible, it works precisely because of the generic envelope in which it is placed. In the final sequence, where convention dictates they should be cheering the hero, the audience instead find themselves flinching at his every deed. Also, rather than the violent acts performed by Mortensen's character resolving his particular conflict, they serve only to destroy his persona and distance him irrevocably from his own family.As the bold title might suggest, A History of Violence attempts to examine the root causes of violent deeds. And, in a pared-down way, it does so: greed, revenge, pride, sadism, self-preservation, heroism and, in true Cronenberg form, violence as a sexual act are all represented here in some form. In addition to the main plot (involving Tom Stall being pursued by mobsters after he foils a robbery attempt at his diner) there is a well-played subplot involving Tom's son Jack and his response to being bullied at school. Seemingly pacifistic at first, Jack is drawn into the violent events surrounding his father...Performance-wise, A History Of Violence is practically faultless. Mortensen excels in the lead, and handles the slow descent of his character with great subtlety. Maria Bello convinces admirably as Edie, Stall's increasingly distanced wife, while Ed Harris is brilliantly unnerving as mobster Fogarty. The real revelation here, though, is Ashton Holmes, whose beautifully understated performance as Jack lends the movie warmth and the audience a grounded point of reference. An actor to watch out for.Overall, an emphatic recommendation to anyone who likes movies with teeth. But a warning to those with a weak stomach...",A History of Violence

432,mike-wright-1,Could have been a masterpiece....,6,12 February 2013,"A History of Violence is certainly a conundrum. If you treat it like a run-of-the-mill action thriller, its pretty good. However the irony is that's the exact type of film that Cronenburg's potential masterpiece is attempting to speak out against. I say potential, because if you treat it the way the director attempted, then it's really a bit of a mess.The film opens, like many films of its genre, establishing the picture perfect family life currently in place for the protagonists. In going over the top with the opening scene, Cronenburg signposts that he is looking to do something different here. That something is to look at violence, the immediacy of it and its effect on those who commit and witness it in an altogether more realistic manner. The first scene of violence is shocking, making the audience lean forward and take notice. A media circus starts to surround the protagonist as the public's interest is stirred and the film really starts kicking into gear. And just as it kicks, the wheels come off.There is a clumsy, muddled attempt at showing the effect of violence on Mortensen's son with a ""monkey see, monkey do"" encounter with a caricature school bully. Further attempts are made with Maria Bello's character, but because her development has been neglected up to this point, it falls flat.The encounters with Ed Harris and William Hurt as the films primary antagonists only serve to confuse things further, as characters who are supposedly at the top of the criminal underworld commit error after error straight from the James Bond book of villains. Personally I think DC was in several minds over whether to satirise the genre, or to show his audience what they really want in an exploitation manner, or to make a straight forward, but more realistic thriller. In the end, it's all a bit of an uneven mess.There is a terrific final scene which to an extent, saves the piece.

433,JumeirahSun,"Weird, but not thought-provoking",4,13 October 2005,"This movie quickly became painful to watch. Not because of graphic shots of bloody corpses or sex scenes, but because it is 1. Not a very engaging story and 2. Filled with terrible acting. Mortensen and Harris are okay, but Harris's role is not that of the main antagonist. He drops out of the movie before long, and the plot drags without him. Most of the supporting cast just plain stinks. The little girl, in particular, is awful. I am willing to be generous where child ""actors"" are concerned but every time she came on screen I just cringed. The role of the son is one of the more interesting ones and I am afraid it came out rather muddled. I believe the director was going for a poignant image of the forming of a young man's character, as shaped by school bullies and the actions of his main role model, his father. Unfortunately, the son utters lines that perhaps needed to be said to move the story along but did nothing for the development of his character. He just doesn't seem genuine--nothing in this story really does. Maria Bello has received some bad press for this but I don't think she is that bad. If one's part is written and directed middlingly well, then it stands to reason that the character will come across as very average and forgettable. The storytelling is heavy-handed and gratuitous: we have the scene that demonstrates that Stall is a loving, caring father; the scene that demonstrates that he and his wife adore each other; the scene that tells us the townspeople like and respect Stall, etc. I found these scenes to be just a series of clichés, strung together but not adding up to anything.

So, she dresses up like a cheerleader, they have mutual oral sex, so, now we know he loves her, she loves him? Okay...sex but no nudity. Then, later, violent sex on the stairs. Why? If she is scared of him, why did she act so passionate? And how did he keep his violence in check lo these many years until the stairs when he starts to strangle her?

So, as far as I know still, Joey could have been a decent guy with family in the mob and just wants to get away from them. If I knew he was mean...well, maybe it would mean something. You remember Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven? Even though his character was now a good guy, you knew that not in the too distant path he had been an evil SOB who killed just about everything that walked, or crawled, and was a killer of men, women and children.

The way he shoots sequences using only one shot to tell a story makes it so much more engaging of a film, than just having a bunch of cuts and different angles. David Cronenberg does an excellent job with storytelling in this film. A History of Violence story is what is really interesting. It shows the good and evil of humans and what it takes for someone to cross those evil boundaries. The only thing that I'm a little eh on is the subpar performances. A History of Violence stars: Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello, Ashton Holmes, William Hurt, Stephen McHattie, & Ed Harris. The performances by Mortensen is sometimes good in this film and sometime it isn't. Sometimes the delivery of his lines aren't that believable. Bello's performance is embarrassing and found myself laughing at how cheesy it is at parts. The best performance in A History of Violence is by: William Hurt and Stephen McHattie. Both of these actors are hardly in the film and give performances better than the leads. McHattie is really mean and I love it. Hurt comes in at the end of the film and the few lines he has the delivery of them is a bit scary. A History of Violence is a film that I don't recommend for everyone.",A History of Violence
437,infinito2345,Not my kind of movie ...but I still give it 10,10,13 May 2006,Violence and emotion never get along together...... The one complaint i have is that viggo mortenson is depicted to be a superhuman being who seems to even dodge bullets and mutilate people.... Maybe they could have depicted the scenes in a more realistic manner.... Also I don' mind excessive violence(i really loved kill bill).But i was not able to sympathize with Mortenson's character.I mean i couldn't understand if he was good or evil...he seemed to be a little of both.... Or maybe that is where the greatness of the film lies..i think you can decide for yourself...It is a fast paced and entertaining movie..but it is too short to form any solid character sketches.Also the sex scenes were completely unnecessary...they seemed to be put to simply attract the audience....For example look at taxi driver...there we can sympathize with de niro's character and the cause for violence is justified...but here causes are blurred and characters are blurred....Highly recommended for entertainment and performances.....But the film seems to lack something...a soul.Or what i mean to say is if the film depicted reality then i think i am better of dead.It left me disturbed.,A History of Violence

It has absolutely NO originality to it.It's about a family man who's past catches up with him.. big deal!!! is that suppose to be suspenseful??

439,canadian_roughneck,Not Bad..Pretty Good,7,26 April 2007,"This wasn't a bad movie. It was kind of slow in parts and in some parts..pointless. It had a good plot and a lot of good fighting scenes. Viggo is a very good dramatic actor and good at playing an almost 'split personality'. The cool thing about the movie is that it takes place in Millbrooke Ontario and it says that it takes place in Illinois. I am from the Millbrooke area, which is cool and I recognized some of the scene locations. I would recommend this movie for anyone who has time. I'd also recommend that you rent it before you buy it because I'm not sure if everyone will share my opinion.7/10",A History of Violence
440,mcdooley,Hurt and Harris are short-lived gems in a big mess,5,25 March 2006,"I had high expectations for this film and was disappointed. I finally quit it toward the end (watching on DVD) as the predictable, cliché, cloying ""moment"" from the little daughter at the dinner table was unfolding. I knew it was coming as soon as the camera went to her.I should say at the outset I'm unfamiliar with the graphic novel on which this film was based. But I did go to IMDb to verify my suspicions that the the script was written by a man, because the wife's part, ""Edie"", was written atrociously. Is she strong and tough, is she weepy and fragile, is she okay with what she learns or not? I have no idea, and this is not a case of a character having subtle complexity. Edie's just a chaotic hodge-podge of fleeting personality traits. Too many of her reactions to various situations made little sense to me. Forgive the clichéd term, but I could not get any sensible handle on her ""motivation"" from scene to scene, except for those where she was fierce and protective (they should have stuck with that). I was amazed to find out the schizoid Edie was a lawyer, based on how we were getting to know her.Ah, but what a perfect dream plaything she is for Tom! In one woman Tom gets to boink the head cheerleader, indulge in a violence and rape fantasy, and then have a woman who Stands By Her Man when the cops come around asking questions.Last random negative observation: Was this guy secretly Batman? What was with the fight scenes? It's almost as though this movie was made from a comic book. Excuse me, I mean ... ""graphic novel.""The two biggest positives for me were William Hurt and Ed Harris, both of whom were--and no surprise here--excellent. Ed Harris's character, generically speaking, is an old tried and true standby in movies. But he somehow manages to bring yet a new inflection to this type; and especially he comes up with an original, convincing brand of sheer menace.If you were to write the dialogue out on paper that is spoken by William Hurt's character of the brother, I think it would look pretty flat and uninspired. But Hurt, in too short a role, makes every line work; he really mines a lot more out of his part than would seem to meet the eye from the script. He creates an intriguing blend of half-psychotic threat and bitter mid-level executive (so to speak) stuck at one spot on the corporate ladder.Low marks for direction. My experience was that first it was going to be this kind of movie, and then whoops, it's going to be more like that kind of movie. No, wait, we're back to the first kind of movie again. This was not a case of breaking genre boundaries in an innovative way -- Cronenberg just couldn't make up his mind what he was directing.",A History of Violence
441,Joropukki,My History with Cronenberg,8,11 August 2016,"They rarely make movies like this any more. Only eleven years have gone since the premier of this film – and now you have to move over to TV to see anything like this. Seeing it for the third time tonight, I was vaguely reminded of the first season of True Detective and on second thought, the American Friend by the German Wim Wenders. The History of Violence could almost have been made in France or Germany. I've never been a fan of David Cronenberg. I think he's been showy and too shocking on purpose, not unlike another David – Lynch. I deeply disliked Twin Peaks, for instance – a pretentious, self-mystifying piece of crap. Here DC is on a good track. Even the music is great. It's fascinating to read the divided comments on this film. I like it because it's really very cinematic and thoughtful. Violence in it is obligatory – like in a Greek drama. I only give it an eight because the ending is prolonged and somehow contrived. Viggo and Wifey are great and the Sheriff very believable. The ending loses something of the spirit of this relative masterpiece.",A History of Violence
442,sanjulathish,Viggo Mortensen is as violent as the Character suggests,8,22 June 2017,"Been a fan of viggo mortensen since watching lord of the rings trilogy and eastern promises. The attitude/screen presence this guy can bring to the screen is near perfect and can only be matched by some, and he delivers yet again in the cronenberg movie A History of Violence. As the name suggest the violence in the movie is good, the action scenes are superbly coordinated. The story gets predictable as the movie goes, but still Cronenberg keeps us immersed in the movie. u know cronenberg is a great directer by just watching the opening scenes which include the family of the protagonist. at the very moment we will feel the bond between the family. every family member did their utmost best, special mention for Maria Bello(as she was great as the wife). the character development of the protagonist is well and tightly done. if you loved eastern promise, i am sure u will love this one too.",A History of Violence
443,D_la,"Strange, and slow, but good",7,7 October 2005,"This is a strange film. I suppose I should have expected that from the director though shouldn't I? We open with two criminal-types, drifting across America, leaving a trail of casual violence behind them. And, if I hadn't seen the trailers, I might have thought that these two were the main ""baddies"" of the film. But although their dead-eyed gaze might be enough to stare down the school's bully, they pick the wrong diner to rob when they head into Stall's late one night. This is where the story takes off, although the pace is still quite measured.Tom Stall, married with children, turns into a hero as he deals, quite effectively, with the two gun men. He himself ends up in hospital, but neither of the robbers will have any cause to see a doctor again. Tom, as a hero, gets his face plastered all over the news, and so results in strange mobsters from the East coast turning up.We never really doubt that Tom has a past, but the film takes its time to get to the truth. And it does so through graphic violence, and sex. I can see why it got its 18's cert here.I suppose you could argue that this film raises questions about violence, and change, and well, a lot of things. In a way it is an old western film, where a good man has to take up arms and fight for his life. But then again, is Tom a good man?",A History of Violence
444,HaN-hAn,A great cast let down by Hurst,7,29 June 2006,"Maria Bello is fantastic as the devoted and loving wife who turns tortured and conflicted after she finds out her husband is an ex-mobster. Viggo Mortensen shows us how a schizo killer should be played. Ed Harris was above average. However, the whole movie was let down by the amateurish performance by William Hurt. He seemed more a clown than a mobster. He was not menacing but laughable.In response to the questions asked about the relevance of the sex scenes to the general storyline, the fairly straightforward answer is that they show contrasts. The initial sex scene between husband and wife is means to be sweet, funny, naughty, and in a strange way, wholesome and consensual. The second sex scene is violent and rape-like. IMHO the sex scenes are used to contrast the life before and after ""Joey Cusack"" comes into the Stall family's life.",A History of Violence
445,DaMarco-2,The most overrated film of 2005,2,4 January 2006,"It is impossible to believe that this terrible film--one of the year's worst--has received such high acclaim and has been deemed one of the best by many critics. Nothing takes me out of a film faster than when characters behave like ""movie people"" instead of like real people. No one in this film behaves or reacts the way actual people do, but rather in a silly dramatic fashion that is pure theatrical tripe.The reason for this vast overpraise is Viggo Mortenson's excellent performance as Tom Stall. His character is the only one which is reasonably well written, and Mortenson delivers as he reminds us that he is one of the most under-treasured actors in Hollywood (along with Alesandro Nivola). He hits every note of his character's conundrum just right.Like ""The Road to Perdition,"" this film is based on a graphic novel, and like that film it features talented actors wasted on a paper thin plot and shallow study of human emotions.You can see the film is going to veer off course in a mundane scene where Stall's son Jack (played by Ashton Holmes) is bullied in the gym locker room. Jack is at first humble but then comes back with smart alecky remarks and everyone laughs at the more popular bully rather than the geeky Jack. Has this ever happened anywhere? Yet we see this idea played out in terrible films like ""Can't Hardly Wait,"" where characters do what we wish could happen in real life, instead of what would actually happen. And that's the rub for this film. The bad guys are always losing, which makes you wonder how they got the status of being bad guys to begin with.Then there is the famous/infamous sex scene on the stairwell between Tom and his wife Edie (Maria Bellow). Anything that gives us a nude Mortenson is certainly welcome, however this scene is ridiculous. I won't give away anything except to say it ends the way every scene in this unlikely movie ends: stupidly and unbelievably.Every year a graphic novel is turned into an overpraised or overly stylized film (""Sin City"" anyone?), when in fact these films never quite get beneath the surface. Twenty years from now people will laugh at the idea that this film was as highly regarded as it is today.",A History of Violence
446,Tomrad,Terrible!,4,30 October 2005,"I am frankly baffled when I read some of the reviews of this film. One said ""nice to see something so original in a genre full of clichés."" I'm sorry? This is the most clichéd, laboured, badly written, laughable thriller I have possibly had the misfortune to see. The four stars I have given it were purely for comedy value, because this film drowns in its own pretensions. It desperately wants to be an art film: unfortunately the director is under the impression than all you need are some meaningful pauses. Consequently, they dominate the film, especially in the hilarious final scene. The script is atrocious, with unintentional comedy everywhere, especially in the cartoon mobsters accompanying Ed Harris. To be honest, I enjoyed this film mainly because of the unintentional comedy (although a lot of it involved waiting a long time for actors to speak). I don't wish to say that there was no artistic merit, either, as it had some interesting things to say about American society, was well shot and the actors did their best with the material; it's just a shame that the dialogue was so terrible and the direction so flawed. I realise it's hard to believe me in the wave of rave reviews this film has garnered, but I feel I had to make my voice heard in the mass of adoration for this rubbish.Catch it on TV if you want a laugh.",A History of Violence
447,rchadwi@hotmail.com,Has it's Moments but Precious Few - CONTAINS SPOILERS!,6,11 October 2005,"My wife hated this movie coming out of the theatre, but I rather liked it. However, hours later I was convinced that I, too, rather disliked this film. The premise of the movie is simple - a small-town diner employee (Tom Stall) thwarts a robbery/rape attempt by two armed bandits. His ability to disarm and kill both bandits is rather ""too good to be"" for someone not specifically trained in the art of killing. Of course, the news coverage reaches some dangerous characters from the Philly syndicate who call him ""Joey"" and insist he was a high-level syndicate member, brother of crime-boss Ritchie (played by John Hurt). The mob guys keep visiting, insisting that he is ""Joey"" (which he vehemently denies) and menacing the family until a final confrontation in his front yard where he again disarms and kills said mob members. Now his own wife is somehow convinced (seeing him in action) that he IS ""Joey"" which he readily (and mysteriously) confesses, all of a sudden. Now she feels she lived a lie, hates him for it, etc. All of a sudden, ANOTHER set of mob dudes (his brother, Ritchie's, crew) says he needs to come to Philly to see his bro. Well, the two bros aren't exactly ""brotherly"" and in fact Ritchie means to kill the person we now know was, in fact, Joey. Another confrontation ensues and let's just say Joey is VERY good at killing people. He returns home from Philly to a very shocked but still-together family. And here the movie ends.Well...what to say? This movie is supposed to be big on character development/study (read: SLOW). Slow it is, with plenty-o-sappy moments establishing the stereotypical small town and Tom/Joey's small-town family life. However, said ""development"" is very, as I said, stereotypical - no deeper or more real than any other of the movies that attempt such a feat. In fact, everything about this movie is pretty run of the mill - the mob guys come, menace the family in the same way mob guys have done in many other films (e.g. showing up at the mall where mom/daughter are shopping...daughter goes out of sight, mom panics and finds her with mob guy...he's being all nice but still gives the old ""veiled threat"" speech). The character of the family is hard to develop due to seriously bad acting by BOTH the children (teenage boy and kindergarten-age girl). The wife begins to actually believe Tom IS ""Joey"" based on...nothing, really - the word of a mobster menacing your family?! Then there's Tom/Joey's ""confession"" to his wife that indeed he did have a secret past. Why confess??? There are so many other ways he could have gone to explain his deftness at warfare (he was in the military, for example...other ""stories"" at which someone hiding their identity would have well developed). Then, finally, the scenes where he is forced to dispatch his attackers are virtually undeveloped, short, and non-suspenseful.So while I was kind of enjoying the movie, the payoff never came. The acting was sub-par by many of the characters (excluding Vigo M. and John Hurt), the characters themselves acted unrealistically (which is not good for a movie whose main claim to fame is character development) and the whole secret-identity/mob menacing aspect was nothing new. Thus, I too was disappointed by the film, while my wife simply hated it.",A History of Violence
448,oliver-stevenson,Very Disappointing.,6,29 August 2006,"The opening scene of the film promised much. The cheap motel, a couple of nasty hoods and plenty of atmosphere. 'Great' I thought. A gritty violent film that would have me thinking about it for the next few days. But no. After the initial hard(ish) hitting opening scene we then meet the blandest, most self righteous, dull family in the whole of small town America in a pointless scene dragged out for 5 mins to fill time. The film descended into what can only be described as a 'Made for TV' movie. The acting was wooden not due to the lack of talent on display but due to the really terrible script and childish screen play. Awful dialogue and terrible characters. I did not feel for any of them. The sex scenes were there to help prop up the film but were a little too over the top.On the plus side. The violence was pretty good with a good level of gore and realism. Great choreography and some slick moves. Ed Harris made a great villain and was a shinning light. He reminded me a little of Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper) in Blue Velvet (but only a little before I get flamed).Over-all I was disappointed by this film. I would not recommend it unless there is nothing else to watch. It was not the worst film I have ever seen.A great idea for a film, wasted. Perhaps one day someone will remake it properly. I have given it 6/10 as its not the worst, it is a great story (although done badly) and the violence was good.",A History of Violence
449,Adrienne85,Ruined by a crappy ending,5,20 April 2006,"Is this a thriller? Last time I checked thrillers were supposed to be exciting and keep you on the edge of your seat..Tom Stall (Mortensen) is an average man married to they lovely Edie (Bello), father of two, working at a diner in a peaceful small town. One day two bandits passing through decide to rob Tom's diner, but their plan backfires as Tom kills them both and becomes hero overnight. Then enters Carl Fogerty (Harris); a mob guy who is convinced Tom Stall is in fact Joey from Philadelphia (an organized killer). He won't take no for an answer..The movie begins with a dry scene where the bandits have just made a stop somewhere, then followed by an awkward sex scene between Tom and his wife. Things pick up quickly when the bandits enter the diner and things start to happen. The idea is original. Mortensen and Bello do a convincing job (Bello seems like she's cut out for the thriller genre). In between there's scenes with their son being bullied at school and you're wondering where the movie was going with that.It's a good movie for about an hour. After that it seems like the creativity ended (and you will know what I'm talking about when you see it - and if you do; told you so).",A History of Violence
450,kevin-477,Superb in just about every respect,10,30 September 2005,"I'm usually up with the movies, but this one completely escaped my attention until I saw a poster advertising it at a bus stop. So, knowing nothing about it at all (except that it starred the excellent Viggo Mortensen - surely the best thing to have come out of the entire bloated Lord of the Rings farrago), I went to my local cinema on opening night to see it. It seems I wasn't alone in lack of foreknowledge, either: there were only 4 other people present. By this time, I was almost convinced it would be awful - but what a surprise.I give this film a vote of 10 because it scored on all fronts for me - least of all for surprise value. Excellently acted by the entire cast (perhaps a special mention for William Hurt, as he wasn't in it for very long, but he certainly made his mark); also tightly plotted, scripted and directed. The violence foreshadowed in the title, though visceral and graphic (be careful if you have a weak stomach), isn't gratuitous and is excellently choreographed. There's also some wonderful wish-fulfilment scenes for anyone who, like me, was bullied at school. Perhaps the only dull point in the entire film was the 'establishing' stuff at the beginning, centring around Tom Stall's blissfully happy family life. But there was a good purpose to it: it set up a particular set of expectations which, had they been fulfilled, would have made the film very formulaic and clichéd indeed. But I was wrong-footed there. The film went on to defy formula, and to play very deftly with the viewers' sympathies. Anyway, the dull points were easily made up for by the action scenes.I won't say any more because it's easy to give too much away. It's probably best to go in blind, like I did - and, hopefully, to be rewarded for doing so.",A History of Violence

A bit too long and drawn out for my liking, but the majority, it would seem disagrees. I guess it's a matter of taste, but to me, the film got quite tedious and a little boring in parts.

The story took a while to get going and then drug for a long time near the end but the middle was packed with good stuff. The first thing I noticed, and appreciated, was the very long opening scene. I didn't time it but it seemed like about 4 minutes with movement and without an edit. Even seeing some of the crew in a reflection didn't take away from this awesome shot. As much as I enjoy sex scenes and naked hot chicks, these scenes were unnecessarily long and graphic. It seemed as though the director just wanted to throw in some nudity for his own jollies. It really hurt the flow of the script. Bad choice! The characters were believable and the SFX work was incredible. The fight scenes were good but the editing was bad. For the editors: One punch = 1 hit. It is so cheesy to add the connection of a punch from 2 or 3 angles because they can't decide which ""hit"" looked best. Ended... poorly.

455,Hellmao,A history of boredom,4,21 November 2005,"Considering the very good ratings that A History Of Violence receives from many professional reviewers and movie fans alike, I am astounded. Some people find it a thrilling masterpiece. Well I don't.After a brief opening sequence with psycho killers on the road, Cronenberg introduces the family of Tom Stall. Parents and teenager son gather around little daughter's bed to comfort her in the wake of bad dreams. Sweet. The next morning they have coffee and cereal food, get dressed, prepare for the day and talk everyday family talk. Yes, it is a happy family and after making love the parents tell each other how much they love each other. All nice and well. Of course, it does not stay that way. The thugs from the opening scene enter town and head for Tom's restaurant with thirst for coffee and evil. To avoid a bloodbath, Tom is forced to use skills from a dark past that make him the local hero, but also draw the attention of some big city mobsters from the same dark past. Tom has to change his identity again to fix the problem, leaving his innocence and a lot of corpses.There are many disappointments in A History Of Violence. First of all, it is full of clichés. The high school bad kid and his sidekick, the local sheriff and the female TV reporter all look exactly how you expect them to look. All supporting roles keep pale and Ed Harris and William Hurt have little to say. Their motives and lives keep unfolded. Tom's wife character is not interesting, neither. When Tom is about to give up and confide in the local police officer, she prevents him from confession. She may have been upset because of being framed for many years, but now she thinks of her family. Stand by your man. The father  son on violence could have been very interesting, but is abandoned when it began to unfold. Cronenberg does not work out any side plot and stays very close to his leading role. Anything around is left in insignificance.Viggo Mortensen is very good as a low profile family man with a quite and deliberate mentality, but it is very hard to imagine the psychopath killer that Tom once was. When he is forced to give up his cover identity, there is no schizo frenzy, no Mr. Hyde touch and no visible struggle. He just goes on. Maria Bello does not look like a happy mid western family mom, but like a anorectic city woman that gets bored to death in a smalltown place. The only thing we get to know about Edie Stall is her faible for kinky sex. Ed Harris has an excellent suit and some good lines, but nothing to say. Later, William Hurt's character is left dead and meaningless the same way, both accompanied by stupid bodyguards. No, this movie is not exciting, not well made, and does not add anything interesting to the reflection of violence. When Tom, amazingly recovered from various shot wounds, returns to his forever distorted family, it does not really matter how they live on. I already looked forward to leaving and did not even read the credits, my ultimate expression of disapproval.",A History of Violence

457,CheeryToes,This movie has everything you could want:...,1,16 October 2005,"Gratuitous sex  I can understand from character development how much a couple loves each other without seeing Viggo Mortensen's head between Maria Bello's legs. I can understand a woman struggling with confusion about who she is, who her husband is, what all this means without seeing a physical fight turn into sex on the stairs. No woman, of the strength of character we are supposed to believe Maria Bello's character has is going to have found out that her husband is no one she knows, has spent half his life horribly killing people for fun and money, have a fist fight with him during which he holds her up against the wall by her neck and then dissolve into sex with him on the stairs.Completely ridiculous violence  I am to believe that the mob guys believe he is Joey Cusack, an incredibly dangerous man who has just threatened them, and yet the one guy will still step in close enough to him to be disarmed? I am to believe that while he is punching that same guy's nose up through his brain  say hitting him 10 times or so  that the other large ARMED man does not just shoot him, but instead waits for him to punch the guy and take his gun and shoot him first.sure. And I saw the son killing Ed Harris a MILE off  so how come Ed Harris couldn't? (and side note, I don't care if you did just shoot a guy, you wouldn't hug your dad with large chunks of said guy all over the front of him) Oh and let's not forget that Tom/Joey has been living in rural Indiana for 16+ years (based on Jack's age) being a dad, husband and diner owner and suddenly he's got cat like speed and reflexes, never misses a step.Dark dreary filming  Filming is supposed to set mood, not overpower it. If I'm noticing the texture and the lighting over the content of the film, something's not working. It's splendidly beautiful fall weather in Indiana and that could have been used as a wonderful contrast to heighten the mood of the movie, but even that was dampened under the heavy-handed ""mood."" (except for one incredibly brilliant fiery red maple that could not be quenched) The whole movie plodded along, plod plod. Mortensen was wooden. I thought the best acting in the movie was the kid, Jack. I just wanted the movie to end and then when it did, I was completely surprised, I said out loud ""Is that the end of the movie?"" and someone behind me said "" Thank God"" everyone walking out of the movie was commenting on what an awful movie it was.

459,selvatica,very predictable,4,14 October 2017,"Predictable from a to z, that's why i give a 4, it's a hapsnatch precooked predigested story for a very lazy,for USA probably, public. very disappointing, cliché sleeping pill full of stereotypes....bla bla bla. ...even their sexual relationship turning kinky,is so predictable....i hoped for surprises and some depth,but none of that. Bad film.( PS: I'm a big lover of 'rêal' Cronenberg: The Brood, Dead Ringers, Naked Lunch,Crash, etc, and don't appreciate his latest try-outs at all, specially his Hollywood escapades like this one or the screaming J.

460,Sy-4,Welcome to Cliché-ville,6,23 October 2005,"Reading through the long list of glowing reviews on this website, I can only conclude that there are currently two movies called ""A History of Violence"" doing the rounds. One of these is a deep, moving, and well-acted thriller; while the other is the pile of crap that I've just seen.Well, OK, the film wasn't completely awful, but you have to feel a movie isn't hitting the mark when intense meaningful looks from the lead actor merely provoke peals of laughter from the audience. The basic ideas weren't bad, but everything was treated in the most simplistic way possible, from the clichéd mobsters to the boringly predictable reactions of the wife to Tom's shadowy past. And the sex scenes! While this movie does probably represent your only chance this year to see Viggo Mortensen performing oral sex on a woman in a cheerleader's outfit, it was all just so obviously tacked on to add interest and (gasp!) shock value to an otherwise plodding movie. It just didn't fit in. The few brief moments of action were fine, I suppose, but nothing out of the ordinary.Anyway, this is more than enough words wasted on a fairly mediocre movie already, so I'll stop there. 6/10",A History of Violence
461,cmzapffe,"Don't Miss ""A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE,"" Cronenberg's New Masterpiece",9,7 October 2005,"""A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE""(2005) Director David Cronenberg has created a near masterpiece with this movie, which is certain to be on my list of the ""10 Best Movies of 2005.""While the title may be off-putting to some and invoke questions from others, I would hasten to assure you that this movie is not as violent as you might think. The scenes of violence, while graphic, are short and then passed over. What this movie does dwell on is the long term effects of that violence, especially its devastatingly corrosive effects on family relationships.Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) is a family man and a solid, respectable citizen of a small farming town in northeastern Indiana. He has an idyllic life with a loving wife, two healthy kids, and a pleasant career as the owner of Stall's Cafe on Main Street.One day two mindless toughs attempt to rob his diner and rape an employee. Tom unexpectedly leaps into action and dispatches both men with lethal force. The media circus following this event creates a very unpleasant aftereffect for Tom when two mobsters show up from Philadelphia and claim him to be one of their own. They demand that he return back to Philly with them.Their subsequent visits create further problems for Tom's wife and children, not to mention the local sheriff who happens to be a family friend. Is this devoted family man really who he says he is, or does he have a dark secret in his past that no one in town knows about?This excellent movie is not about violence but rather a thoughtful study about why some people find it so difficult to escape their violent past in an effort to change the course of their lives. Be forewarned that there are also several scenes of intense sexuality in this film. Grade: A, Recommended? Highly! One of the best movies of the year!

But at about 48-58 minutes through, it took a turn for the worst. It had some very strong brutal violence and strong sexuality. Not for young ones....lol. I don't mind those things. But it wasn't the great film i was hoping for. Disappointing, but not the worst film I've ever seen. In other wards, not a great film. But it is decent if you are just looking for a time killer.Also Don't watch special features before viewing the movie, the features contain spoilers.The acting was good.The plot was decent.The pacing was decent.My rating: R- strong brutal violence, sequences of strong sexuality, Language, at times pervasive.Hope that helps!",A History of Violence
463,rob_lavender,Thoughtful thriller packs a punch,8,31 August 2011,"David Cronenberg's crime thriller is a neat piece of work, tied up in a tidy 96-minute package without ever feeling hurried. The acting's generally of a high standard all round, with Viggo Mortensen standing out in the lead, and Ed Harris and William Hurt particularly impressing in supporting roles.The story centres on a family man's heroic deed in foiling an armed robbery, and its aftermath, which sees news coverage bringing unwanted attention his way. The distinctions between peaceful small-town Americana and big-city organised crime are writ bold when the two worlds collide, and the ripple effects of violent acts are shown to their fullest extent.What Cronenberg gives us is a regular family in a regular town, one to which we can all relate. So when he sets thrilling action scenes atop this melodrama backdrop, it feels all the more immersive; we watch movies so a part of ourselves can imagine our own lives taking such a dramatic turn, and by contrasting movie-script events with the mundanity of everyday life, this is made all the easier.A History Of Violence is an artfully restrained piece. Although aspects are undoubtedly gruesome, they're never dwelled upon, and it's a better film for it. It's unflinching, yes – but it's never gleeful. We see characters suffering the consequences of their actions, in some cases physically and others mentally. It doesn't preach, but there's a touching tale redemption to be found if you care to look. 4/5",A History of Violence
464,benihana83,Flawed but somewhat effective,6,1 October 2005,"In ""A History of Violence,"" Viggo Mortensen plays Tom Stall, an average guy in a small rural city. He and his wife, Edie (Maria Bello), share a healthy and loving marriage with two children (Ashton Holmes and Heidi Hayes). Tom owns a diner in the center of town, frequented by the locals. The townsfolk eat, drink and carry on inconsequential conversations about the simple life.It all seems like a story lifted right out of ""Leave it to Beaver,"" but things take a sharp turn for the worst when two thugs hold up Tom's diner one evening. In one swift move, Tom is forced to shoot and kill the men, saving his life and the lives of his employees. He becomes a town hero, attracting national attention and fame.Tom's newfound celebrity brings a horde of new patrons to his diner, but it also brings some unwelcome guests. In walks the mysterious Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris), who seems to be mistaking Tom for someone else. Their encounter sets the stage for a poignant, albeit flawed look at violence and its influence on those it touches.""Violence"" is based on a graphic novel by the same name, but it strays from that version drastically after the initial premise has been laid out. Cronenberg himself has even said he had no idea Josh Olson's screenplay was based on a graphic novel until they had completed several drafts of the script.Despite its ingenious premise, this is far from a perfect movie. Among many, two particular faults stood out. First, the initial half hour is an uncomfortable mess, as Cronenberg tries to establish the character of Tom Stall and his relationships with those around him. It isn't until Tom's encounter with Fogarty that the film finally begins to take shape.The score is also way too overpowering for this type film. With all the huge, sweeping horns and strings blaring over every scene, you'd think you were in the middle of a superhero movie if you had your eyes closed. In a movie like ""Violence,"" less would have certainly been more.Despite a multitude of nitpicks, ""Violence"" rebounds mainly on the shoulders of its cast. Each actor should be recognized for raising the level of Olson's mediocre screenplay. Mortensen really shines here, giving a nuanced performance as Tom. He plays the character sheepishly at first, but drastically changes his approach as the story unfolds.Then there's Ed Harris, who gives what may be his best performance since 1999's ""The Truman Show."" In ""Violence,"" he gets a great change to show his terrific range as an actor, although I would have liked to see his character developed a little bit more.The real gem, though, is Bello, whose character has to watch this story unfold for the first time along with the audience. Edie Stall doesn't know what to think, let alone what to do about the situation, and the subtle emotion in Bello's eyes works better than words ever could. She received a Golden Globe nomination for her work in 2004's grossly underrated ""The Cooler,"" and turns in another fantastic performance here.Cronenberg has earned quite a cult following over the years for his offbeat work. He is best known for directing bizarre and grotesque scenes in movies like ""The Fly,"" ""Shivers,"" and ""Scanners."" So, in a film about violence directed by one of the masters of violence  along with Quentin Tarantino  you would expect some scenes to be particularly sadistic; but while the bloodshed in ""Violence"" is gritty and certainly gruesome, it is also incredibly real. In this film, Cronenberg has chosen not to glorify the brutality. Instead he has painted a stark portrait illustrating how a seemingly idyllic society and its inhabitants can be affected when violence is inserted to the equation. While it is reasonably flawed, ""A History of Violence"" still manages to serve its purpose adequately.",A History of Violence
465,imdb-2078,Remarkably Inept,4,5 September 2006,"Great acting can't save this film, in which absolutely everything feels unnatural. Its origins as a ""graphic novel"" are all too apparent: every scene, word, and action feel like panels in a comic book.The problem is that it disturbs the flow of the movie; it's hard to stay with the plot when every character acts like a comic-book character instead of a real one. If the movie were tongue-in-cheek it might work, but clearly we're supposed to take things seriously -- and that's hard to do when every word and action ring false.Mortensen is very good, Bello is excellent (and smokin'), Ed Harris is brilliant, and William Hurt is completely miscast as a Philly gangster boss.Both the violence and sex are graphic; the former is gratuitous and disturbing, the latter is very affecting.",A History of Violence
466,mega_mike,"Harris rules, Hurt...not so much",7,8 June 2006,"The first half, maybe even first two thirds of this movie are excellent. The story, acting and cinematography (especially at the beginning) are all top notch. Unfortunately the movie falls apart into a cliché filled cheesy action flick in the final scenes.What really stands out in the first part of this film is Ed Harris's performance. Harris' stage presence in this film is unbelievable and grabs a hold and does not let go in every scene that he is in. William Hurt's performance at the end of this film is memorable...but for all the wrong reasons. As another poster put it, he plays the stereotypical gangster so close to the vest its like he is a cartoon character (i.e. Jason Isaacs in ""The Patriot""). The character does not flow out of Hurt and appears forced...which makes his performance look exactly like it is....a performance.Overall this is a good movie and is worth watching. Is it Oscar worthy? In the best scenes, yes...in the rest....dear god no.",A History of Violence
467,FairiShadows,"Good movie, but not quite worth the hype",8,11 October 2005,"Let's get some stuff out of the way...It's not as violent or bloody as everyone would have you to believe. Are you someone who watches real crime shows on TV without a second thought? Heck, have you seen some Law and Order episodes? It's really not THAT much worse than that. And the scenes do not last too long. If you can handle that, then you have nothing to worry about.The sex scenes are... um graphic. Not as in porno-graphic but as in well maybe soft-porn. They however, are plot driven, well directed, well acted essential pieces to the film. If you can't accept them for those reasons, then you shouldn't bother. You'll be distracted when that's not the point at all. And why should you see a film if you're not completely open to what it can give you? Now, those two seemingly craw catching tidbits are gone, let's get down to my personal views.I absolutely enjoyed the film. I think, that if I had my druthers, I would have gone in a completely different direction both in writing and directing. I however, don't get paid to do either of those things, so we'll just leave that alone. What was done, was done pretty well and what wasn't done all that well in my opinion, could be for story reasons that I do not understand.Overall I thought it was good. I'll start with the acting though. I keep reading about how wonderful the acting was. OK, it wasn't bad, but really? I was only blown away by Viggo Mortensen, annoyed by Maria Bello, wished there was more of Ed Harris who was great in his part, mildly amused by the children (Ashton Holmes and Heidi Hayes) who I thought had glimmers of hope that were too soon dashed and sickened by William Hurt who I think is a fine actor but this part made me rethink that.Like I said, I enjoyed both Mortensen and Harris. They seemed to get this film and then become the film. Bello didn't seem to realize where she was at any point. It was like she was on hyper-load the whole time. She gave an overwhelmingly underdeveloped performance and by the end I was screaming for some of that violence to spill over onto her. Hurt was just comical. I can't explain it, he was just amazingly funny in a part that I don't think should have been quite that funny. If you could have gotten rid of both Bello and Hurt's performances this could have been a really great film.Aestetically, this film totally rocks. Forget the blood and gore, everything else worked wonderfully. You don't get a beauty sense from the movie stills. In watching the film, you can't help but marvel at the brilliant cinematography. You know how they say it's about location, location, location? Well, they may be right and this film understood that.Having never seen a Cronenberg movie in my life, I can't compare it to any of his other works. I can say, that if this is just a glimpse of what he is capable of, then I'll have to look for his other projects. I'm guessing this is the most commercial of his products and it is quite commercial in an indie/artsy kind of way. I say it that way because it's a little too real and gritty to really be called commercial. The guy knows what he's doing though. He made a film, that if I was just looking at the nuts and bolts of it, I'd laugh that it ever got made and turned it into a chilling work of art. I often watch a lot of good movies or good stories, I hardly ever see a good film though.The music does what I think most film music should do, it enhanced the story but it didn't power the story. Often, I watch a movie and I hear it more than I see it, which for my overactive imagination does well, but in a film that's telling the story, the music shouldn't take over the job and it doesn't here.Well, if I obviously like it, then why isn't worth all the hype? Well, it's a good film, absolutely, but it's being dubbed one of the best of the year. It doesn't quite live up to that bill. The development of the story is a little lopsided, like I said, the acting wasn't complete, the dialogue left a lot to be desired considering the other wonderful aspects of the film and by doing that, it glared harshly rather than melt with the overall feel of the film and retouching the development of the film, for what it did show, the film was too short. It's great to leave us with questions and open to debate, but I don't think leaving us feeling like we don't know who the heck these characters (other than Tom Stall who I completely credit Mortensen with conveying who this guy is superbly)are nor do we even care as part of one the best films of the year. Personally, I like all of the characters to be rounded enough for me to feel their importance to the story. If I can't see that, all I ask is why did you waste the time to bring this character in anyway? And those are a few of the reasons I don't think it's worth the hype that it's received. It's great, yup. But it ain't that great! Overall, I like this movie. Is it for everyone? No, but then again? The LOTR trilogy, Star Wars, Jaws and Titanic aren't for everyone either. I'm sure there are those of you who'd argue with me on that one, but trust me on this.",A History of Violence
468,rlipton,subtle and trope destroying,9,3 October 2005,"This is a strange modern day western, like Unforgiven, it looks like one thing and is really another. Its a bit like David Lynch's blue velvet, or the Cohen's Fargo, a normal setting turned into the abnormal in terms of both expectation and action. This movie is actually wickedly, darkly funny in many respects, scenes undercut what people say, what people say undercuts the actions. Tom Stall telling his son that he shouldn't have beaten up the bully and then slapping his son was obvious but fun. Other things were more interesting, there are bookended sex scenes, in the first sex scene it was all ""gee whiz, oh my gosh"" cute, Maria Bello in a cheer leader costume, the other sex scene was far darker, and dangerous and very ambiguous in terms of what the viewer should take away from this. THere are lots of quiet man/heros with a past that were forced into action/chose action, Shane is an archetype, Unforgiven another example. But this movie brings the question into a new light, Stall seems to have genuinely recreated himself as the laconic and peaceful mid western town dweller, there is a past, he has gone beyond it. He has great kids and a great relationship with his wife. The obvious message of the movie is that its really not that easy, nor should it be, to leave one's past behind. Stall's past saved himself and others in the diner, stall's past almost got his family and himself killed. Who is stall/Cusack, and does it matter that he was one thing once and another now? Was he hiding his ""real"" identity or actually became a different person than the person he was in a previous life. The ambiguous reaction of his family is also very good, they want to blame him, scream in righteous anger at him, but at the same time, keep him. The scene in which his wife cries in his shoulder in the presence of the sheriff is quite remarkable, she is genuinely crying, in confusion, loss, etc. Interestingly, the family didn't leave, there wasn't even a question of this, except for his son running out and getting nabbed by the ""hard men."" Another question has to do with Tom protecting himself and his family from his past, he brought this on himself, yet if you believe that he believes he is a different person than this seems a legitimate claim. And its pretty clear that Viggo was not playing this as a cynical way to hide. It seems a story about someone trying to overcome his past with quite uneven results. The only slight problem I had was with Tom Stall's seeming lack of action when Ed Harris came to town, the only explanation for this is that he was truly convinced that he was in fact just tom stall, if it were not the case, Joey would have immediately gotten his family to high ground after Harris came into the diner, armed himself to the teeth and gone hunting for hard men wearing black. So too, when he was sitting in the chair in his brother's office, he had to know that he was at extreme risk, it was only a matter of luck that he survived that encounter and he seemed so ill prepared, this was the one flaw in the movie, even the best assassin type character would not have been so casual in the face of such deadly force. Otherwise, kudos, a thoughtful, decentering, deconstructing movie that sustains reflection",A History of Violence
469,michaelamurphy,Over-the-top and Far-Fetched,6,4 July 2007,"David Cronenberg's film about a man (Viggo Mortenson) who saves his wife and co-workers from murderous criminals in a brutal fight in his restaurant, is awarded the title of town hero. Tom Stall (the hero's name) gets uncontrollable business boost as a result. During the morning rush, three men dressed in black sit at the bar called Tom by Joey Cusack. Tom repeatedly tells the trio that his name is Tom, not Joey. However, the crew's leader, Carl Faugerty (Ed Harris), knows that this ""Tom Stall"" is not who he says he is. Faugerty is so determined to weed out this Joey Cusack, that he even follows Tom back to his house multiple times. After a brutal shootout on Tom's front lawn, Tom's wife, Edie (Maria Bello) begins to wonder if Tom isn't all he claims to be.Despite having an interesting first half, and being extremely entertaining throughout, this was a huge disappointment. After seeing the previews for this film, I was anticipating this film for the longest time. When I finally saw it, I was surprised that it wasn't very good.The story is intriguing, but after the first half, it starts getting very far-fetched and ridiculous. Just graphic brutal, over-the-top violence is the only element this film weighs itself on. It tries to hard to be good that if it just was made as a regular movie, it could have been much better.As for acting, Viggo Mortenson was the completely wrong choice. After watching this film, there is no way you can even believe that this is the same guy who played Aragorn in the Lord of the Rings series. Maria Bello is top notch and definitely should have been nominated for Best Actress (or supporting Actress) in 2005. Ed Harris is also very enjoyable during his scenes. AS for William Hurt (who was nominated for Best Supporting Actor) was completely awful. He is in the film for a max of 10 minutes and does absolutely nothing.As for the movie, it is enjoyable but not all its hyped up to be. I was very disappointed and I believe anyone else who watches this film will feel the same way.",A History of Violence

Unchanging soft bland music that comes with every scene whether it's tense, light, sexy, violent, or a family scene. Strange frequent U-turns in character personality. Super cringey sex scenes. Dialog written by AI trained on nothing but old movies and soap operas. Script written by an alien familiarized with humans only through TV and radio transmissions in space.

A brilliant combination of contemporary violence and the old film noir conventions. This movie can be said to work on many levels but it also appeals to the bottom line in all of us.Despite the slow parts and the highly ambiguous ending, I highly recommend this film and urge those who have seen neither this nor Eastern Promises to see this first.",A History of Violence

473,Hurr78,Riveting,10,25 September 2005,"I really liked David Cronenberg's films from the 1980s. Videodrome, the Dead Zone, the Fly and especially Dead Ringers were expertly assembled films that caught my attention and held it. With the exception of M Butterfly, I really didn't care for anything he did in the 1990s. It seemed as though the man had lost his touch. But what really happened was that he was just in his cocoon... he went in as an expert horror/thriller director and emerged as a fully realized master. Spider was a good warm up. Now he has made, in my opinion, the finest film in his career to this point.Cronenberg expertly plays his key themes off of one another: family, the disturbing connection between intimacy and violence, and the uncontrolled nature of violence, no matter how skillfully used. We see that even the most controlled violence is not a scalpel, it is a sledgehammer that spreads unanticipated waves of destruction rocketing outwards. This is no lightweight film... it will leave you with a great deal to discuss if you are open to what it has to tell you.A History of Violence also benefits from very strong performances from all of the principal actors, and an appropriately modest score from Howard Shore.It's probably the best film I've seen this year.",A History of Violence
474,KarinaGW,I still haven't decided if I like it or not,8,27 October 2005,"It is a well-done film with very strong performances by the entire cast. It is very pretty cinematographically. At various junctures of my life I have had the hots for each of William Hurt, Ed Harris, and Viggo Mortensen...so it was fabulous seeing them all together in one film. But, I still haven't decided whether it was brilliant or horrible as a whole....it's very odd. I wasn't surprised to feel that way right after, but 24 hours later, I still can't decide.One bit of warning, there is probably 5-8 minutes of reasonably explicit sex (in my opinion, the scenes went on just a little bit past when they should have to convey what they needed). This is not really mentioned in any of the advertising. It made for an interesting time because I saw it with my 17-year-old son (we are both huge action movie buffs). Fortunately a) we get along really well and were not hideously embarrassed about it and b) we were the only ones in the theatre, so we could comment out loud about it.",A History of Violence
475,sc_taylor,Outstanding!,9,4 October 2005,"Cronenberg finally departs from his trademark ""body-horror/sci-fi"" genre. But not exactly into the mainstream.Whilst this is one of his more straight forward and linear plots, it unfolds slowly and with an eerie sense of not quite knowing where you are being taken next. The performances are all excellent, with Mortensen almost underplaying his role - to stunning effect. Mario Bello is first class as the loving wife forced to confront the truth about a man she thought she knew.The movie is shot in quite long takes and Cronenberg is not afraid of giving his actors quite long, almost uncomfortably long, pauses. It is a seemingly simple film, but its menace unfolds within you long after you finish watching it.The final touch with the little girl welcoming her daddy home is magnificent.",A History of Violence
476,burgerific,The Most Overrated Film of the Last Decade,1,29 December 2005,"While ""A History of Violence"" makes for some unintentionally good humor, it is by far the most overrated movie of the last decade. It is so cliché-ridden that I found myself time and again: 1. Seeing what was coming 2. Giving the director/writer too much credit and imagining no one could be that clichéd 3. Trying to devise alternate scenarios that wouldn't be so contrived, only to... 4. ...discover my first, and worst suspicions were trueSome examples: -Tom's wife says that she would like to make up for the fact that they didn't have a chance to be teenagers together. Cut to Viggo sitting on his bed, looking anxiously at the closed bathroom door. Now, the first thing that comes to my mind is ""Oh God, she's going to come out in a cheerleader outfit"". Then I begin to doubt myself; ""No, no one could be that clichéd. Maybe it will be a school-girl outfit, or basketball jersey..."" Nope. Cheerleader.-Tom blows away Ed Harris' toadies, but is not unarmed, injured and at the mercy of Ed. Where's the shotgun? Where's his son? Pow!-Tom returns home after killing his brother and his wife sets his place at the table, thus representing that he is welcome back into the family and his sins are forgiven...gag me.Beyond Viggo and Maria Bello literally every other performance in cringe-inducing (and not in a good way). Harris and William Hurt deserve particular attention as their characters are about as three dimensional as a sheet of newspaper. Tom's son is one of the worst schmactors I've ever seen in any film, ever. Add to this boring cinematography, a sleep- inducing pace, stilted duologue and some of the most outrageously dishonest scenarios ever put on film (the school jock has it out for the son because he caught a fly ball...in a gym class baseball game!) and you've got a bad 1983 made for TV movie, but even that may be giving this film too much credit.",A History of Violence
477,se7en45,Cronenberg delivers another landmark film,9,3 October 2005,"Cronenberg has craftily delivered a film that superficially looks like a mainstream offering in the Capraesque style but, it is in fact, a multifaceted exploration of the thin veneer that separates passive calm and glacial rage. This technique is deceptive and lulls the audience into a false sense of serene security before the primordial violence takes residence inside the peaceful shell of the main protagonist.John Wagner (the creator of ""Judge Dredd"" and ""Strontium Dog"") takes the basic theme from R. L. Stevenson's macabre novella ""The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde"" and drains out the Victorian melodrama and replaces that with a grim contemporary reality. And there is an undeniable nod to John Ford's cerebral and elegiac ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"". The questions raised are rich in complexity and the answers on offer are nightmarish. What is the price of freedom and justice? A bullet? Chew on that unpalatable concept as your morality hikes up her skirts and flees though the exit doors.The richly plotted screenplay has what the recent ""The Punisher"" sorely lacked. Both films are sourced from similarly themed graphic-novels but whilst ""The Punisher"" showcased super-heroic antics and fancy shoot-outs and bled out the psychology and sociology, ""A History of Violence"" decides to opt for a psychological study steeped in sombre vitality. A slow burner it may be, but the film has an edge as sharp as a bullet tearing through a jawbone. This movie should be seen as Cronenberg's calling card for the proposed adaptation of Alan Moore's groundbreaking ""Watchmen"".The performances are so real you'll swear that you're watching a documentary. These actors kick the scrotum of current Hollywood trends with a vengeful glee.Everything falls into place in this movie apart from Howard Shore's soundtrack. He seems to be recovering from his ""The Lord of the Rings"" marathon and some of those melodies have been lethargically regurgitated for Cronenberg's opus. Nevertheless, this is a minor quibble and I have to stress that the sound is well used in this film. Whether it's the clinking of coffee cups, the loading of shells into shotgun barrels or the harried breathing after a run across the fields, the soundstage artists have done a splendid job. And let us not forget the sounds of silence. They eerily build up the nerve-wracking suspense far more powerfully than if they were allowed to underline the action with a thunderous soundtrack.Get drunk on this profound and compelling film, gorge yourself on John Wagner's graphic-novel and spread the word.Highly Recommended.",A History of Violence

Both the sex and violent scenes are quick and direct. While the violence is quite graphic, as to be expected with Cronenberg, the camera does not linger on it at all. The real story is told through the emotional dynamics in the family as the plot unfolds. Mortensen's performance as Tom Stall is brilliant and wonderfully nuanced and the entire cast is first rate. Maria Bello as the wife and Ashton Holmes as the son and Ed Harris as the ""heavy"" are spot on. William Hurt's scene is a standout. There are moments in the film where you laugh and then are horrified within seconds. DC doesn't dumb down to the audience but enjoys the complexities of human reactions to issues of identity, violence and society's view of ""good"" versus ""bad"" violence. I still can't get this film out of my mind. I'm definitely planning on seeing it again when it opens widely. Highly recommended.",A History of Violence
480,charlie_mc_us,liked it,7,7 March 2007,"I liked the action scenes in this movie -- and it's a little weird, since Cronenberg is making some kind of statement about violence. Even though I can't figure out what that statement was. This is the only Cronenberg movie I've liked -- I found all his other movies to be pretentious and silly. So finally I like one -- and here's this William Hurt accent that not only has nothing whatsoever to do with Philly, but is fake sounding, too. I guess some critics complimented Hurt for that accent. Sheesh! OK, if I have to take up a few more hundred characters, I'll do it with a question. What was the last film Hurt was good in? Maybe he was replaced by some zombie Hurt that heard it needed a Philly accent, and thought that was some kind of euphemism, and just made up the worst fake-sounding accent it could.",A History of Violence
481,hapiores,From the man of the independent circuit...,8,15 January 2008,"Always a name taken into account, David Cronenberg has changed the course of his cinematic career in the last couple of years. Being a synonym of independent shock films dedicated to the symbiosis between flesh, machine and technology - for which he was know throughout the eighties and nineties - his last two movies seem to deviate slightly from this kind of thematic.""An history of Violence"" circles around the idea of how violence surrounds us and how it can be part of the history of an entire country. An ordinary family is chosen, in a small town with quiet lives and a tight community, where everybody knows everybody - all but the white fences are shown. Things seem to change when an unfortunate event puts Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) doing what he didn't seem do be capable of when he kills two criminals. From this point on we're confronted with the changes within this family as a whole and those in each of the characters.The independent feeling that Cronnenberg carries with him, no matter where he goes, gives a perfect psychological mood to the picture - as with ""Eastern Promises""- and the pace, always very calm,tells us that this is not a movie about action but violence. Stray by a little and it will fail. In the core of the movie is one of the things he himself pointed out, this idea that it shouldn't just show violence to the audience, it should provoke people in a way that they would have to make a choice between rejecting what they see or embracing it and desiring it. This is very pertinent since we are used to see people killing portrayed with all the lust and style.",A History of Violence
482,REvans9092,Don't Miss It!,10,1 June 2012,"This action-packed movie is one of the best films I've ever seen! It moves quickly and doesn't sugarcoat realitydealing realistically with family problems such as bullying, crime and sibling rivalry. The actors are flawless in their STUNNING performances. The main character Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) is a family man who owns & operates a diner. He's living on a horse farm with a devoted wife Edie Stall (Maria Bello) and two beautiful childrenthe American dream. His dream and bucolic life turn ugly when his past and current relationships collide. The script is SO flawless that you begin to experience every circumstance that befalls each well-crafted character.The school scene in which Jack Stall (Aston Holmes) is bullied is so realistic that it makes you cheer when Jack kicks the bully's ass. Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris) looks and acts like a scary, bitter man.I loved, LOVED William Hurt's character Richie Cusack. He's absolutely chilling and believable as the other brother who has gone to the dark side to head a crime family. The final scene with Tom's daughter is touching and made me cry!Every part of this story is well acted and well scripted. Don't miss it!",A History of Violence
483,Ultra-violence,Well played and well said....,8,8 March 2006,"It's refreshing to see a film that is trying to make some what of an effort to differentiate the style of film work used in today's films and to poke at the lifestyles that we accept in todays culture. The film starts off with two mafia thugs leaving their vacant hotel room, murdering the hotel clerks with absolutely no remorse and maybe even a little pleasure. It's not just a hint that they killed the clerks and maids, but as you see the bodies lying in the office in a puddle of blood with graphic images of throats being slit, you begin to realize that this film's pace is based off a great deal of realism. You're then introduced to the ideal loving American family that attends the needs of every member of the family, regardless of the situation. Although the dialogue is extremely over exaggerated and at times unnecessary, you begin to understand the use for it as the characters develop. The story follows the life of Tom Stall a husband and father of his family and who seems to be the biggest lovable wimp and/or loser of the small town that he lives in. After the characters are displayed as being a pure and simple family in a small American town, the families image is disrupted when an extensive and graphic love scene that involves a cheer-leading uniform between Tom and his beautiful wife, Edie Stall. Although it could be perceived as a pornographic scene, they are married and they are allowed to do what ever it is that they want to do behind close doors and it does prove that even after having two kids, they are still very much in love with each other and that Tom has the picture perfect life of a husband and father.Tom Stall owns a diner in a small town where one routine evening of closing up shop, the same two thugs at the beginning of the film enter the diner demanding service, after they have been told to leave. Like any other mafia thugs, they become agitated by hearing the word no and begin to clean up house by killing everyone in the diner, all for the pleasure and to cover up their footprints. Tom sees an opportunity to save the day and turns into attack mode and killing the two men with hand-to-hand combat and the thug's own guns. The graphic display of the aftermaths of a bullet entering the back of one the thugs head and exiting through the lower half of his face returns to the realism approach that the film is trying to display. This is a disturbing image but very necessary to complete the effect. Tom is considered a national hero and his name and photo are on the national television news. Being the modest man that he is, he regrets having to kill to solve the situation, but understand that there was no other way. During his fifteen-minutes of fame, he is discovered by Carl Fogarty, an older man that is being followed by two other thugs dressed in a casual suit who could be nothing else but involved with the mafia and begins calling Tom ""Joey"" as if that his real name.Meanwhile, as Tom's son, who is heavily influenced by his fathers way of handle a very dangerous situation, he decides that the only way to solve the problem he has with the high school bully is to viciously attack him and his friend during a confrontation in the school hallway, leaving the two on the ground with a grotesque look of broken noses and busted lips. Tom becomes angry at the fact that he used violence rather than words to confront an ever so common schoolyard bully, although Tom used violence to solve his problems.After being stalked, threaten, and harassed by Fogarty, a confertation in the front yard of the Stall household proves that maybe Tom is not really Tom and maybe that he is this viscous trained killer named ""Joey"" that he has been claimed to be. After his confession in his hospital bed, his family loses trust in him, not knowing who their husband/father really is. They become very angry at the fact that he has lied to them all these years, but they do not abandoned him. After a couple of days of the silence treatment from his family and another threat over the phone from members of the Philadelphia mafia, he decides that he's going to go into the lion's den and end it once and for all, for the protection of his family.A History of Violence is based off the graphic novel written by John Wagner and Vincent Locke and is more of a graphic novel in motion that anything. The dialogue is short and blunt, but also necessary and acceptable for this style of film. It shows the real effects and outcome of violence, almost making the audience feel ashamed at the fact that we pay to see violence in films, but is shown to only be necessary when it comes to the protection of one's family. The film ends with an open ending in which isn't accurate to the novel, but still able to challenge the ones mind of acceptance and consequences in the most extreme situation. A History of Violence is a great film that actual discourages the act of violence and encouraging the commitment of family through the roughest of times, that is rarely seen in today's culture.",A History of Violence
484,cpburrowes,Good but not great.,6,23 May 2006,"Something a bout Cronenberg's work always leaves me unsatisfied and this film is no different. I enjoyed it. It was well acted, well written, the effects were excellent as well, but the effect it had on me was rather blah. If the acting, writing, visual effects are great, I find it most easy to use Cronenberg as my scapegoat and I blame him once again for coming close to greatness. I must admit that his is far better than his feeble attempt at the eroticism of car accidents in Crash but, as I've been saying, I walked away from this viewing experience unsatisfied. I can't put my finger on the cause of my lack of satisfaction but it remains, nonetheless. Good movie but definitely no masterpiece.",A History of Violence
485,crell54,A history of violence..... FANTASTIC.,9,15 March 2006,"David CRONNENBERG. Directs this movie with such expertise, that he should have at least been nominated for an Oscar. This film is a must see. Viggo Mortensen is out of this world as the family man/ Mafia killer who must face his past [ which he kept from the misses] and we all know guys that, that is a big no no. They always find out. Anyway, Maria Bello is good as the wife who finds out her husbands dark secret and his son played by ASHTON HOLMES is really good. ED HARRIS is superb as the bad guy and WILLIAM HURT is good as RICHIE the mafia boss. However. You do get a little annoyed at the moppet who plays the daughter, She tries to be a DAKOTTA FANNING but fails miserably, apart from the sodding kid, this is one strong film, slow at the start but it soon picks up and develops into a film that could challenge American BEAUTY into my top five films of all time.

486,Chris Brown,not appropriate for minors or the faint-hearted,9,11 April 2008,"Excellent casting. Excellent acting. I believe the script was more original than most films. There's drama, suspense, and action. A bit of a psychological element is very briefly thrown into the mix. Cronenburg could have more fully explored this psychological element, but he chose not to go that route. (I am neither praising nor attacking that decision.) The story is not hard to follow, but it does throw surprises at you from EARLY ON. Thus, I must advise that you read as little as possible about this film before watching it. Even reading the back of the DVD case will spoil some of the film's early plot. This film possesses a powerful ability to put you on the edge of your seat with anxious anticipation of what you *think* is going to happen next. If you read the back of the DVD case, it could hinder the director's ability to make you feel the right amount of tension.I would highly recommend that minors not view this film. The violence is much more jarring and visually brutal than what you see in the Die Hard or Terminator series. I would instead compare the violence to the shots I've seen in some brutal gangster movies.A movie has to have something special to get a ""9"" from me. This film wins due to an original script and its ability to put you on edge.",A History of Violence
487,e-shabalin,A History of violence,4,29 May 2006,"I do have this movie on DVD, but I truly expected much more than it really was offering. The storyline is much too simple, I've seen it all before. Here in Holland they use this type of story in life insurance commercial on TV. And it has even a comedian side of story. Have you seen JOE DIRT the movie? Exact type of trouble Christopher Walken gets into, old gangster changes his name, leaving big city behind for a God forgotten village, after he become a hero the bad boys came to mug him, and guess what, he killed them all. In JOE DIRT they fitted the same story into a couple of minutes of action within they're own story. There is nothing new in A History of Violence, no fresh new ideas. I know Willam Hurt as one of the greatest actors of all time, my personal opinion. See Smoke the movie for example. But in this video clip he get's a short appearance, which I've expected to see much more than that... And there're so many lacks in this story, like where is the FBI? The two serial killers moved from state to state so it's FBI problem, but there is no any kind of presence of them anywhere. And killed gangsters from Philly and NYC are no case for the local traffic-Sheriff, the FBI suppose to surveillance and questioning the whole family. There is no gangster left alive, they killed them all in close range, in cold blood, police will never buy they'r story, FBI will develop they own theory which will lead to Philadelphia.Notice! If you take a closer look at the crime scene than you'll find 3 dead body's, murdered in cold blood. One body shot to death (his gun has never fired a bullet, so he was shot before he drew the gun, if he had any), second one shot in the back (probably he tried to flee), and another one with broken arm and broken skull (and again you won't find any traces of gun powder on his hands). The ""victim"" him self has been shot with minor injury as result) Conclusion is simple it doesn't look like self defense. There is no possible way to clear up this situation to any authority's in the world. Statements of his son or wife would be seen as not reliable, they'r all closely related. They definitely need a lawyer or two... But please find out for your self and make your own judgment",A History of Violence
488,ejwells-2,Obviously MANY just don't get it,8,11 February 2007,"It's humorous to read the negative comments on this film. I guess there's really no getting away from dunces posting reviews. It's all part of the game, and, quite frankly, the major percentage of movie goers are basically dunces, only impressed by some glossy Joel Schumacher, or Michael Bay dreck. But, happily, for the rest of us there are directors like David Cronenberg, Chan-wook Park, Takashi Miike, Takeshi Kitano, etc. who make films that are original, thought provoking, and challenging. A History of Violence is one such film, and possibly the best English language film of 2005. Absolutely pitch perfect performances from the entire cast (special nod to the great William Hurt, with what might be the best supporting performance of the year), and to Viggo for stretching a bit. The script is great too, but the film (no shock here) achieves it's greatness from Mr. Cronenberg, who NEVER disappoints, ALWAYS surprises, and often reinvents elements of the craft.

490,brianoh2,"Good, but ........",7,9 February 2008,"I thought this was an entertaining movie and thoroughly enjoyed it. There was good acting by classy actors. All of the main actors were a credit to the movie and the director. Obviously for that to happen, the director did a fine job. To put it a little more into perspective however, this movie sought to appeal to our basic instincts of the ""good"" guy beating the bad guy. This is probably partly because it rarely happens in real life, but quite often in Reel Life. From that perspective it has similarities to Rocky and Rambo. The movie has an interesting twist insofar as most of us think that the ""hero"" is not actually the bad guy initially. As he begins to get into the car with Harris, it appears he will go to ""Philly"" and all will be sorted out. The one thing that I found unrealistic and unlikely was the reaction of his family to his alter ego, Joey. I guess that the sex scene on the stairs was to show us the double standards of his wife to the extra persona of her husband. I gave the movie 7 out of 10. That may appear a little light on, but that is to reflect why this movie has the appeal that it does. Although highly entertaining, it is because of the main reasons it is appealing. My vote reflects my opinion of the story, the screenplay, the directing, the casting, and the acting. It is good to see good actors employed to entertain and show their wares. Unlike some movies that I have seen recently where acting talent has been utterly wasted - a la ""Little Fish"".",A History of Violence
491,panicoma-1,Clueless Plot less Formless Pointless - Usual Cronenberg Fare,1,15 May 2009,"I watched this directly after the magnificently wretched Eastern Promises (see my comment), and didn't realise till the titles came up that it was a David Cronenberg effort. After slagging-off his Anglo-Russian pantomime and awarding perhaps half percent credit for Mortensen's performance (not without critical drawbacks), I wondered if I'd done him an injustice; maybe he'd actually made a WORSE movie and I'd just missed it? I wish ... This is far, far inferior to the later effort (and I will stress - EFFORT).Why do they keep on giving this man money to try to make movies when it's painfully apparent he hasn't even got what it takes to make a third rate film, and this is with a cast including Ed Harris and William Hurt? Okay, it's based on a graphic novel, but isn't it about time they gave him something more suitable to do with his time; adverts for The Mindless maybe, shampoo promotions or dogfood slots? I'm reminded of Steve Martin's line in Trains, Planes and Automobiles, when he says to John Candy's Dale Griffin character, 'hey and here's some advice, next time you tell a story - have a point'. Here there IS no point. The unraveling anecdote has no form, no plot and no direction, but I think we've come to expect that haven't we?Once again Mortensen is great, the only thing he does wrong is to get involved with the piece, and he ought to steer clear of this director chum if he wants to retain any dignity or progression in his career. It's one-dimensional, and keeping with his usual theme, Cronenberg has no sympathetic characters, in fact none of the characters have any character at all. If he's a film-maker fascinated by violence, we'd all be better served by leaving him in a dark room to tell himself what he'd like to do to all those intellectuals who make witty, themed movies full of body, charm and charisma (Wes Anderson for instance), directors who hit the mark on every outing with courageous invention, multi-layered creativity and possibly much lower budgets?While there are Cinemas still able to break even in the face of recession, it seems madness that no-one can spot meaningless operas of mayhem before they get any further in production than the story-board. There are so many useful and talented artists, from writers through to those more heavily involved in such projects that it seems inconceivable that not one person with the requisite power to stop this sort of drivel had the balls to yell out 'CUT' before the whole silly episode got out of hand.My biggest gripe with David Cronenberg is that he doesn't appear to credit his audience with any intelligence at all any more, or perhaps he's lost the ability to spot a good story. I now think he's capable of screwing-up any and every idea he's handed, and the man must be restrained physically from entering any studio with the intent of telling a tale HIS WAY.Of the actual film, William Hurt, miscast as a Philadelphia heavy, and Ed Harris with ridiculous mob uniform of black suit,tie and shades are given clunky clichéd dialogue the like of which (sorry for the cliché) has not been heard since the original '50s series of Dragnet. The sex scenes, those heavily overdone, ambiguous -(does she like it, doesn't she like it) - have all been done before, with grace and danger, and so much better, in B movies from the Golden Age of Hollywood and New Wave French Cinema.What was Cronenberg trying to say,(badly)? Perhaps, 'everyone reverts to their real personality in the end'. Well David, on this showing, you've proved that YOU do!",A History of Violence
492,Big Huge Doug,Not what the reviewers promised,4,27 October 2005,"My wife and I were severely disappointed in this movie. It's workmanlike enough, but not a particularly fine piece of film-making. Mostly, though, our disappointment stems from the fact that the hype was very different from the reality. It's a fine movie until about two thirds of the way through; then things take a slightly unexpected turn and the entire promise of the first part seems to vanish. All the plot threads involving the son, for instance, vanish completely, never to return. In the final third, the movie devolves into something very mundane. It doesn't have anything profound to say, nor does it say tried-and-true things in a particularly entertaining way (though William Hurt is always fun to watch). The reviews had me believing that this movie had some really interesting insights into our culture of heroism and violence, but that's not what the movie is about at all. Save this one for your rental list.",A History of Violence
493,dr_praetorius35,"Cronenberg, wizard of cinema...",9,3 October 2007,"What a great director David Cronenberg is. Whatever he touches becomes gold: in every movies he directed (most of them, horrors), there is so much more to gain than pure fun that its easy to be overwhelm by it... But he rarely make movie for the casual viewer and, although A History of Violence is easily his most commercial movie to date (that is the sole reason why I give it a 9 instead of a 10), there is more in this flick than the usual commercial all-public movie... and this ""more"" is understandably the Cronenberg touch.Cronenberg is well known to make movies that the viewers are invited to search meanings, though he never gave the answers: as I said in other movie comments: it's part of the reward that comes with the viewing experience. And so is the case with this really intelligent movie: it's not about suspense or surprise ending, it's about violence and the way, as an audience, we react to it... and the way we may use it in everyday life. While rather sparse, the violence in this film is always quite realistic (with the results showed in typical Cronenberg sensibility, so it's not for the squeamish...) never gratuitous... Which may be why the audience may be led to embraced the violent counterpart of Mortensen... It's so much easier since Cronenberg take the time to let us bond somehow with the Stall's family and the deep love between Tom and his wife.This is a real intense movie, even if you know already the story, believe me: and that is the part of Cronenberg's talent. He and his crew worked with a well written script and everyone gave it its due. The performances are stellar: Mortensen and Bello are quite touching (and really intense and passionate), while Harris and, especially Hurt, are simply juicious in unconventional mobster role... And the lines everyone delivers are not clichés, so you're in for an interesting ride (again: even if you already know the story, which was my case when I first saw this movie)...Anyway, except for the soundtrack (and even that may be part of the process to make the audience connect with something that looks at first glance an average movie, with average characters, etc.), there is few clichés in this ""commercial"" movie. The action sequences are not made to be artistic but realistic and there impact is thus quite enhanced. And, since everybody is easily attracted by sexuality, it is well known that Cronenberg always approach this side of human life with, well, few taboo... I'm sure you won't see often, in a commercial movie (again, I said it), a couple so much in love do the 69... (oups!) Well done...Again, Cronenberg and his fine cast have made what is easily one of the best movie of 2005... That it seems almost already forgotten is a shame...",A History of Violence

I don't usually like violent or gory movies but I very much enjoyed this movie. The story has a lot of twists and turns and you can't predict whats going to happen.The movie leaves you thinking about how sometimes you really might not know a person as well as you think.

495,MrLuthor89,One of this year's Best...,10,2 October 2005,"David Cronenberg is one of those directors who likes to mix it up...and truly give the audience something different. In this day in age of film, different...is something that we really need. YES it was extremely violent (Well with a title like A History of Violence...what do u expect?)....but lets face it, in America, violence is almost as common as breathing. Especially in American film. But Cronenberg doesn't waste time trying to sugar coat violence as a beautiful martial art that is always done in the name of justice or choreograph it with a baley teacher, instead he shows it for what it is. The violence is rough, hard-hitting, fast, gruesome, and most of all...real. Cronenberg shows us a man who tries to deny his natural born, violent behavior and ability to kill on response. With this...I give you A History of Violence...The film begins with a couple of psychotic, kill-and-rob for no reason maniacs who, just after murdering everyone who ran the motel they stayed in, decide to rob the wrong place at the wrong time. The place is Stall's diner. The man who runs this place is named Tom, he's a quiet, courteous, caring father and husband. We see how Tom lives before his run in with these psychopaths. He has a great marriage (whos sex life is obviously in great shape) and two kids who love and respect him...so how could this man be ""so good at killing people"" as Ed Harris's character says. Tom is faced with a dilemma in watching these men take hostage of people he knows and cares for...so he violently takes the two men out. From there, it's all a downward spiral from his family's peril caused by an old enemy named Fogarty (Ed Harris), his marriage falling apart with his wife (Maria Bello), his son's (Ashton Holmes) sudden behavioral change, his turn into his old self, and his final confrontation with his brother (William Hurt). This movie doesn't glorify violence as countless other films have...it merely shows how violence can be necessary to defend the ones you love.This film gives way to a myriad of brilliant performances. First credits go to Viggo Mortensen, who could have done what Ben Affleck did, after a couple of successes become a Hollywood dimwit, and do a bunch of mindless, brainless, pointless, and totally and completely unnecessary films. Instead Mortensen turns in an amazing performance that could go along the lines of a Jimmy Stewart type of character. You look in his eyes when he is the loving and caring father, and you see innocence and compassion, but as he begins to change, you can see the intensity of anger and violent rage in his eyes, even when he is not fighting. Maria Bello has always been an overlooked talent, for a long time now. She plays the victimized wife role differently than most. She obviously loves this man through anything, but her confusion is evident during she and Mortensen's fight/sex scene. Ed Harris gets high points for playing a chillingly, venomous character. His mobster is played out brilliantly. I am convinced that even without the frightening eye he could have pulled off a convincingly evil performance. I'm hoping for Harris to receive yet another Nomination for this film. Speaking of nominations I also hope the Oscars pay close attention to William Hurt. Hurt has had a long and respectable career, but he has never hit the notes that he has hit in this film. While only having one scene with Mortensen in the finale, Hurt displays a brilliant, villainous, and somewhat comical performance as Mortensen's vile, mafia don brother. The fight scenes are gruesome, especially the battle between Mortensen, Harris, and Harris's men. The finale with Hurt and Mortensen goes from an intense interaction with the two great actors into yet another violent fight sequence. But there are some comical points in the finale, including William Hurt reaching for his keys (When you see the film you will understand).Ashton Holmes is also a new talent to watch out for as Mortensen's slowly changing son. Brilliant film all around.9/10",A History of Violence

I was so grossly disappointed as the trailer appeared quite different but I was grossly disappointed to find yet another appalling Viggo Mortensen film, and yet another shocking gangster-eqsue film-that-tries-to-be-something-it's-not (ie Revolver). For anyone who tells me I'm shallow for not seeing some deeply hidden, and meaningful aspect to History of Violence- I have to ask, what on earth this hidden meaning would be, and why it has to be quite so hidden, as if it wasn't for every single second of it being dreadful, the film had the potential to be really good.",A History of Violence
498,DouglasGlendower,Slow but steady...,8,27 October 2005,"A good piece of character driven drama, History Of Violence is shot in a dark and simple style that draws the viewer in and allows the best impact from the excellent and small cast. Viggo Mortensen gives an understated performance in the lead role, moving quite well through the slowish pace of the movie. Ed Harris is... Ed Harris, coming off quite enigmatic and believable in his role as the heavy. The movie reminds me quite a bit of the slower film noir that I've seen, and works quite well for a mature audience. Teens looking for ""violence"" in Violence should stay away, 'cause the background scenes will put them off. Adults who don't like graphic violence should also pass.

499,kmscb-1,The story lets the actors down.,8,8 October 2005,"""A History of Violence"" is one of those movies where as you're watching it you're thinking, ""This is very well acted and well directed"" but where there are still so many little things that consistently pop up to keep you from being fully involved in the story, it begins to hurt.The basic premise is the perfect American myth -- a gentle family man confronted with violence is forced to take action to protect himself and his family...again and again. You can see it in classic movies ranging from ""High Noon"" to ""Cape Fear"". Added into the mix is the American ideal of a second chance, of re-inventing yourself and starting life anew. And Tom Stall is, without question, the epitome of an American man caught in a bad situation who is forced to do things he swore never to do to end the danger to his wife and children. It's too bad the filmmakers became more interested in keeping the pace of the movie up rather than letting the story tell itself.First let me emphasize, the acting in this film is exquisite. Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello, Ashton Homes, even Ed Harris and William Hurt in characters that are written as one-note, all of them make these people as real and believable as you can imagine. And David Cronenberg knows exactly where to put the camera for the maximum effect, even if it's for a long, languorous take that leads to a horrible realization.(SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ON)But the script! It's B-movie at best, and not even good at that. It ignores story for effect, ignores logic for pacing, ignores reality because it's just too inconvenient. And I know both Cronenberg and Jack Olson are responsible for it. There are so many occasions where the truth of the moment is violated by something stupid or by confusion as to the basic timeline. In the opening, for instance, a man guns down two people off camera with a pistol in the middle of a deathly quiet morning...and you don't hear a sound. Not even a cry. The only point being Cronenberg and Olson want us to be horrified at the realization of what happened as we waited, bored, outside. Okay...maybe that's a stylistic choice, but dumb things like that keep happening.Tom Stall kills two men in his diner, saving several lives, and the only people who greet him as he leaves the hospital -- that night? the next day? two days later? -- are some townsfolk thanking him for what he did. No reporters, even tho' the story's even being carried by CNN; no cops wanting to talk to find out if these guys mentioned any of the other killings they were involved in; nothing. He just drives home and a lone TV reporter waits patiently beside his door to question him at just the right moment...and he blows her off.Then some gangsters come rolling into town, not quietly or subtly or even gently, as any supposedly intelligent man who's running a major crime syndicate might do; no, they come in with everything but trumpets sounding to announce their arrival. My first thought was, ""How'd those idiots live so long?""I think the one that really tore it for me was the ""climactic scene"" at a mansion outside Philadelphia, where we have a gunbattle and not one cop shows up. Not one security guard. Nothing. Gunshots going all over the place in an area of filthy rich homes, and nobody takes notice. Yeah, right.What makes me hate not loving this story, tho', is the final scene. Where the actors did work so silently beautiful and heartbreaking, I ached for them being in a movie whose story was only half-baked.I attended a screening of ""A History Of Violence"" where Josh Olsen said a lot of things were left out of the script and the movie because he and David deemed them unnecessary and/or boring. And that made me was to scream. A similar comment was made, once, by a film teacher when I was in college. We were discussing ""The Grand Illusion,"" a 1937 film by Jean Renoir about POWs in WW One. There is a sequence in the movie where two Frenchmen who've escaped a German prison camp spend the night with a German widow and her daughter...and for the first time we realize that war has wiped out a generation of men, leaving behind families who now have to cope with their futures. My professor said, ""The whole bit is unnecessary; the film could have ended with the men's escape and still been a great movie."" My automatic response was, ""And that's all it would have been. With that section included, the film's story became poetry.""And that to me is the one great fault with this movie -- its makers became so focused on telling a quick lean story, they all but deliberately removed any possibility this could have been poetry on film. The actors sensed what it could have been and delivered; too bad Olson and Cronenberg let them down.",A History of Violence
500,JoeStracke,I think I see the problem...,8,19 July 2006,"After seeing this film, I logged on to skim through the reviews-- as I always do. I also never watch previews, since they only serve the same purpose as a top-heavy bimbo in a beer commercial. Instead, I prefer to simply scan the shelves at my local video store for things that catch my attention. Sometimes the films I rent are good, sometimes they are so-so... and yes, some I find utterly worthless.Regardless, however, my opinion is derived solely on internal influence. I find it amusing that so many people rate a film based on previews, past films or preconceptions. One would think these types would eventually weary of being disappointed in life, and develop some sort of method to stave off the illusion they dwell in. I even read where some brilliant soul offered suggestions as to what *could* have made this film a 'blockbuster'... as if that were some sort of Holy Grail, and not the mark of what has come to mean over-budget celluloid drivel! Enough ranting; bottom line: Think for yourselves.I liked this film, all in all despite the rather disjointed beginning. The immediate contrast threw together emotions that leave one with a feeling of unfounded discord. I later understood that the effect was supposed to infer a 'storm on the horizon'-type mood but as I implied before, I knew nothing of this film before pressing 'play', so I was left feeling a sort-of annoyed trepidation.The 'violence' theme runs on several different levels simultaneously, making a rather unique continuity. Character development was used efficiently... intentionally sparse at times, I believe, in order to allow the viewer a chance to imply what they will, without being pointlessly mired in meaningless tangent.In summation, this is a very worthwhile film for those who enjoy film... but should be avoided by those resolved to prejudice.",A History of Violence
501,Illymovies,"""graphic sex scenes and violence?""....then you missed the point!!!",10,25 February 2006,"I always try to read the good comments for a movie, but especially the bad ones before I see a movie. I must say that some of the bad comments on this movie are well...pretty bad themselves. And why are most comments coming from the US criticizing the so called ""graphic sex"". And I quote somebody from Austin TX saying ""some of the sex is hardcore. I swear they're doing a 69 on screen). A lot of people seemed to think that the sex scenes were just put in to add interest to an otherwise boring movie. Why does everybody mention these so called ""graphic scenes""? First of all, they're not that graphic, and they're done in a completely tasteful manner. And I found these scenes to be absolutely necessary for the movie and not a cheap way to ""shock"" us, as another writer put it. There was nothing shocking about them, and it defined a very important part of the couple's life (their love making). Obviously, as she learned something about her husband that she didn't know before, something pretty dark about him things changed between them. The way she perceived him as a person affected her in that she was both afraid and curious about this ""new husband"". Thus the kind of cute, love making scene was contrasted with the more lustful one in the second half of the movie. I thought this contrast was necessary for the movie. I also loved Vigo's acting and I thought he was a great pick for this role. He was always so extremely calm, and innocent and at times you couldn't really tell if that was the real him or if he was still Joey. I loved how this movie was really about a certain duality that exists in all men (meaning all people, men and women). And this duality can be anything and doesn't have to be attributed only to violence. I think the director was smart enough to use violence to capture our attention. Just like Kill Bill shocked us with the violence, this movie did too (only to a much lesser degree ...I thought). At the end of the movie, we don't care if Vigo is Joey or Tom, because he's back home, he's back to what's good and he's back to the only thing that he has left and at that point we know that he has managed to redeem himself. Some have said ""Vigo was not effective, he was just quiet"" and ""it started too slow, it was boring"". This movie kept me intrigued from beginning to end (it didn't drag on because it was only about 1.5 hrs.)and it was beautifully filmed. For all who thought that this movie was all about violence and a seemingly stupid plot with unnecessary added graphic sex scenes, I can only say that unfortunately you missed the point! Hopefully YOU won't.",A History of Violence
502,yrfilms,A top notch thriller,10,5 June 2005,"I saw the film at the Cannes Film Festival. All I have to say is: Wow. One of the best thrillers ever. It's refreshing to watch a film in genre that's so often full of clichés. Besides being a thriller, it also a smart film about the culture of violence. How it dominates our world. One of the questions the film asks whether one can live free of violence, even the slightest. In the film violence lurks in every corner and the characters are forced to defend themselves. Definitely my favorite Cronenberg film, also his most mainstream I might add. It's a modern Western and reminds one of those great Western films. As the title indicates it's a very violent film but guess it will be toned down as usual, specially the sex scene. All the stars are in peek form and perfectly cast. William Hurt makes a comeback to better roles. He was also great in ""The King"". It will and should get some awards at the end of the year from critics and etc.",A History of Violence
503,mrbill-18,Poor Screenplay and Directing Undermine Decent Story,3,17 March 2006,"Although I have not read the graphic novel on which it was based, the dialog in ""A History of Violence"" sounds like it was lifted directly from the story's source. (Was this screenplay writer really nominated for an Academy Award?) William Hurt almost saves the movie, but his role is too small and too late to have much effect.Although Mortensen is also good in his role, such as it is, his relationship with his wife (including gratuitous sex scenes), played by Maria Bello, and the ""loving family"" scenario set in backwater Indiana story are completely unbelievable.

How long will this family be able to stay in small town U.S.A, before the cops tie the first 5 killings with the the rest of the killings at his brother's house? Why did the movie try to get us to sympathize with a guy who not only did not leave his violent tendencies behind, but appears to have passed them on to his family. Ed Harris and William Hurt are a welcome addition to any film, but the sex and the nudity are filler. The scenes of violence are the only part of the movie that fits, everything else is a mess.",A History of Violence
505,Tinuvielas,"A clever, manipulative, well acted and highly entertaining take at the title-giving topic",9,25 August 2005,"More than the average bunch of journalists showed up at the Hamburg press screening of David Cronenbergs suggestively titled ""A History of Violence"", eager to see the R-rated film that had caused quite a bit of discussion (and uncomfortable laughter at the exaggeratedly graphic scenes of violence) in Cannes. It turned out to be a very refreshing experience indeed. Although this is easily Cronenbergs most accessible film, one that may disappoint old fans but will certainly win him lots of mainstream viewers, it's still a long shot from the cliché-ridden thrillers one usually gets to review. A clever, manipulative take at the title-giving topic, oscillating between relaxed mid-western realism and the extreme, almost comic brutality one has got used to in the wake of Lynch, Woo and Tarantino. Very minor plot spoilers in the following two paragraphs: ""A History of Violence"" is the story of simple, good  not to say good-looking, though his film-wife Maria Bello calls him just that, in a slightly ironic moment typical of the film's many Hollywood-references  family man Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen), who's suddenly faced with a couple of brutal killers walking into his coffee-shop with every intention to wreak havoc. He rises to the occasion, surprising himself, his employees and the audience by deftly finishing the villains off, and becomes the rather unwilling all-American hero of the day. Unfortunately, in the wake of Tom Stall's sudden fame, an evil big-town gangster (Ed Harris) shows up, black limousine, scar-face, bodyguards and all, who insists on recognizing Stall and mistaking him for someone else  someone with, precisely, ""a history of violence"" behind him. The gangster lingers in the vicinity, threatening Stalls idyllic small town family life, raising questions and suspicions. And of course, eventually, the situation gets out of handWhat really distinguishes this mistaken-identity plot of the type ""innocent-man-is-faced-with-violence-and-has-to-act"" from other, similar films (Dirty Harry and many Westerns come to mind) is the way Canadian David Cronenberg manages to deconstruct the US-culture of visual violence and armed self-defense by seducing his audience to embrace that culture, to like his characters in spite of their brutal actions, to have fun and feel uncomfortable about it at the same time.In addition to that, Cronenberg also takes his audience on a ride through the total range of human emotions from loving tenderness to blazing hatred, portraying every possible human relationship, each of which features an aspect of violence at some time  sexual relations certainly included, though those may not feature in full-length in the US theatrical versions... Man and wife, parents and children, brothers and sisters, boys and girls, old friends and young bullies  you get it all, portrayed by an excellent, carefully chosen cast of actors that manage to make their characters come realistically to life in spite of  or rather in juxtaposition to  the topical story. Cronenberg in fact took pains to choose actors who aren't just charismatic, glamorous stars taking care of their image, but who have a reputation for embracing their roles, for being somewhat eccentric and therefore willing to go beyond the usual acting limits. Next to Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello and Ed Harris, there is also William Hurt who appears later on as a criminal and who, quite obviously, really enjoyed his role. The final scenes between him and Mortensen are easily the most drastically violent ones in the movie, reminiscent of the graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke this film is based on. They are also the ones that had the critics laughing  although it was the kind of laughter that sticks uncomfortably in the throat.",A History of Violence
506,legadillo,neatly made,6,2 October 2005,"but kind of empty. It doesn't say anything new. It asks 1) can a man redeem himself of capitally heinous crimes; 2) even redeemed, should he escape the punishment of the state; and 3) would you want to live with him? The family's descent into violence is pretty improbable: the father can still assassinate whole groups of menacing people after 15 years without practice (maybe he did tai chi behind the garage all those years just before dinner); and his deadly facility is genetic: his milquetoast son proves surprisingly adept when pushed too far by a couple of school bullies. And those after-office workouts have paid off for the wife. She lands a few direct hits on her husband's head after more than a decade of perfect peace and marital harmony.I dunno, it was just OK.

507,fuzaborsky,Interesting to say the least,8,3 October 2005,"Spoilers:Wow, two movies this year and I have been incredibly impressed with both (other being Batman)What a thought provoking flick this was. And how refreshing for a movie to end when its supposed to instead of being dragged out 2 hours just for the sake of making a 2 hour film. It is great when a film ends when the viewer actually thinks it should. How many times do we sit viewing a movie and it keeps fading out to another useless scene. Not this one. How did it end in your theatre? Mine, the scene went black and house lights came up immediately....wow! What a great technique. Then it faded for us to watch the credits.Few comments,No, the two criminals at the beginning were not sent by Ritchie. In my mind they were sent to show that if you have a violent background no matter how hard you try to escape it violence will seek YOU out. Like honestly, what are the chances of those two fellows ending up in that small town. Of course they also started the chain of events that lead to him being found again by his old acquaintances but more so I believe to show he couldn't escape.Even the final scene you wonder, did he escape it? His son and daughter make a gesture of forgiveness at the kitchen table but not his wife. (The sex scene was definitely not a sign of forgiveness)Inbetween are typical Croneberg gross out scenes and some brutal violence mixed in with some surprising laughs. He used both very successfully as he had my packed theatre laughing, moaning in disgust and even some nervous laughter during the sex scene.Finally something a little different to watch instead of the same old formula crap, remakes, etc that keeps getting pumped out nowadays.",A History of Violence

510,jtbrat3,"A decent flick, with a flash of inspiration",5,3 October 2005,"""Tom Stall"" seems, at first, a thoroughly nice, if somewhat dull fellow whose life mirrors the virtues of the small Indiana town where he lives with his wife and two kids. He is mild and self-deprecating to a fault, plainly a stranger to the anger, brutality and criminality of the big city.We are surprised - and so is Tom, from all appearances - when he deftly kills a pair of murderers who invade his cafe one day at closing time. Against his will, he becomes a ""hero"" and his exploits are celebrated in the media.Unfortunately, the publicity brings three gangsters to town, who claim to know ""Tom"" as ""Joey"" and to have some scores to settle with him. He says he has no idea who they are and his wife and kids, along with his neighbors and most of the audience, believe him. However, after some suspenseful moments, we learn that he is, or at least ""was"", ""Joey Cusack"", the brother of bigtime Philadelphia mobster, ""Richie Cusack"", and a person with a well-deserved reputation for violence. It seems that after a falling out with his brother several years earlier, he left Philadelphia and assumed a different identity. The revelation that ""Tom"" has a ""history of violence"", raises questions about who he actually is. Is he still ""Joey"", or has he really become a different person, ""Tom""? Tom/Joey is summoned to Philadelphia to meet Richie. As it turns out, Richie plans to have him strangled, but Tom/Joey is simply too strong and too quick. He turns the tables on his attackers and leaves them all - including Richie - dead on the floor of his brother's mansion. Then he returns home.By now, of course, his wife and children are thoroughly disillusioned. They no longer know who he really is, gentle, unassuming ""Tom"", or savage, ruthless ""Joey"". It is obvious that their trust has been shattered and will take time to rebuild, if indeed that is possible at all. The movie ends with Tom and his family silently eating dinner together, amid tensions you could cut with a knife. This is not a great movie, even if you are convinced, as I am not, that people can suddenly and radically change who they are by an act of will. A lot of the scenes are hokey and unreal. Some are laughable. There are also a lot of dull moments, so few will complain about the scene where Maria Bello flashes her sex at the camera, however gratuitously. For me it was the high point of the film.",A History of Violence
511,Hermitage171,blissfully skates the line between wish fulfillment and art,7,4 July 2006,"Perhaps the oldest and most pervasive motif in wish-fulfillment/fantasy cinema is that of an unstoppably tough fighter who does not seek violence, but has it forced on him by the bad guys. Tom Stall/Joey Cusack, as we see him in this movie, is such a person. I know that it is not realistic, but I heartily enjoy watching him take on a bunch of armed villains without holding any weapon himself, and subduing them in a matter of seconds. Likewise, I enjoy watching his son smash the mindlessly evil school bully into a pulp, after making every reasonable effort to avoid a confrontation. These situations aren't realistic, but they have an undeniable crowd-pleasing appeal, perhaps appealing especially to men.At the same time, Tom's death-dealing prowess is more of a problem for him than it is for most action heroes, who are happily nice guys one moment, and killing machines the next moment. Tom finds this duality so difficult to reconcile that he splits the two parts of himself into different personalities, with different names. Apparently, he even goes into the desert at some point and performs some kind of ritual to ""kill"" the violent personality, or at least to gain dominance over it.The theme of an action hero being torn apart by the tension between their instincts for violence and compassion is also not new. See Ender's Game, Blade Runner, and some versions Batman, and several others that aren't coming to mind now, for different takes on this theme. This brings us a bit in the direction of an art film rather than a fantasy film, because of the moral and psychological difficulty of the protagonist.Also, the way that this movie is scripted and directed very much suggests the artsy genre rather than the fantasy genre. There are few if any cheesy action hero punch lines, many of the scenes have a slow, brooding quality, and there is no facile resolution at the end.As we see it Tom/Joey in the course of this movie, some aspects of his violent personality remain, but the nice personality seems to stay dominant: even when the character returns to Philadelphia, and begins talking more like Joey, he asks for peace. (Note that the city of brotherly love was an ironic choice for a murderous showdown between two brothers.) This is, as I see it, a personal victory for the protagonist. However, we are left with the question of whether he can return fully to his life as Tom Stall, now that his dual nature has been revealed. Can his wife accept him? Will he able to stay there, or will he have to flee and find a new identity to avoid the retribution of the mob? Will his family have to hide as well?

521,myrealnameisjon,It Kills,9,7 May 2008,"David Cronenberg showed his ability to shoot himself in the proverbial foot with his film Eastern Promises. However, he showed an equal, but opposite ability to make a masterful piece of crime-based art with A History of Violence. In my immediate curiosity, I wonder if a direct could really get Viggo Mortensen to foul up a role involving a cool character. I submit that one cannot and Cronenberg failed to do so in Eastern Promises despite multiple attempts. All failures aside, A History of Violence is a great film. Mortensen is a master of his craft and showed every bit of his skill in this film; Ed Harris plays devious as well as anything else and he made for a frighteningly mischievous bad guy; Maria Bello was as stunning in presence as she is in beauty; and I would like to make mention that young actor Ashton Holmes showed more range and believability in character than most actors twice his age. My only critique about the film is that Harris' henchmen looked like they were better fit to be extras in a low-budget porno. I realize the overall insignificance of their parts collectively, but I would have gone with more mobster and less Ron Jeremy's third cousins.",A History of Violence
522,njbono-1,Wow just awful,4,22 October 2005,"OK for the guy who said people didn't like this movie for the nudity and/or the gore - wrong! We didn't like this movie cause it has no story.The problem with this movie is 1. Bad writing2. Terrible Directing3. Horrible actingWe were laughing at the serious parts in this film.OK so I'm not going to spoil anything here, makes no sense to do that. The film's first 10mins are painfully slow. Viggo is actually very good in this, I like how he handled this role and seemed very convincing at times.As for the violence and nudity - they didn't offend me at all. I found the gore to be very different from a lot of other films. I do have to admit though, the background music and the color of the blood reminded me a lot of some of the older Friday the 13th movies.Now, I like William Hurt but his role is joke, sometimes painful to watch. Thank god he has some really good films in the works!One other thing, nothing against anyone else in the world.. but only Italians and Spanish folks should be making any kind of film involving the mob. See the mob is not supposed to be funny in this movie, but they make em out to be stupid and it really disrupts and tension that is trying to build! I suggest DO NOT SEE THIS FILM. If anything wait for video.thanks.. Jim",A History of Violence
523,Geronimo2900,"Good, but nothing particularly special",7,21 March 2010,"*Spoilers* A History of Violence, for me, was a film that was interesting in terms of the themes it covers (redemption, identity etc), but was nowhere near developed enough to be classed as the masterpiece some call it. Running for only 96 minutes, i felt that, upon discovering that Tom Stall was, indeed, Joey Cusack (which was fairly evident, but i won't go into that), the portrayal we were given of Joey as a past character was fairly weak and solely violence orientated, getting to the point where he seemed more like a fatal subconscious from a Jet Li film than a real person. References to Joey's history with Fogarty and to his time in the desert promise an interesting exploration into the character, yet none of this surfaces. Whether this is meant to be subtle, i do not know, but to me it simply came across as slightly empty.As for the plot of the film, there were several things that i though didn't really fit. Firstly, the whole section with Tom's son, Jack, seemed utterly pointless, with the whole relationship between him and the bully being entirely cartoonish - and the addition of the girl Jack's friends with seemingly being entirely devoid of a point. It seems like this whole chapter was put in in order to lead up to Jack and Tom's 'showdown' or to prove that somehow, genetically the 'Cusack' family were born to fight... Secondly, why did Tom run home instead of call Sam or borrow a colleague's car? Also, Tom was ex mafia, not ex ninja, so why can he fight ten times better than any other member of the mafia? Why does no one shoot him A) At his house when he's breaking the henchman's nose B) At Richie's when he's winning against the guy trying to strangle him? Overall entertaining, with good performances all round, but numerous significant flaws and a far too shorter run time detract from the film quite heavily.",A History of Violence

Both purchases were based on recommendations and reviews i had read. I watched Crash first and was absolutely stunned - a fantastic film, so i had high hopes for 'A History Of Violence'. I was sorely disappointed.The idea behind the movie is a good one. A very good one. However, the film itself is a bad let down. The script is shockingly poor. Some of the dialogue is like it has been written by a 10 year old.The mobsters are like characatures of mobsters. The kind of mobsters you might expect in a spoof movie. They are not believable in the slightest.The acting (from everyone except the main characters) is bargain basement acting.The sex scene on the stairs is totally unbelievable.

525,supcuzz,A chilling masterpiece,9,7 October 2005,"First a personal gripe: It's about DAMN time that a distribution company had the guts to release a movie like this to over a thousand theaters so people like me don't have to drive to New York every time they want to pay their hard earned money to see something other than Vin Diesel and The Rock. Thank you for that, BUT, shame on you for basically revealing every plot point in the stinking trailers. It's like I need to be sequestered for two weeks before any good movie comes out because you people ALWAYS REVEAL WAY TOO MUCH IN THE TRAILERS!!!! Ever hear of LESS IS MORE??!! Why do we need to know about the act of violence in the diner, and that the main character's true identity is shrouded in mystery?? Why not just say it's a frigging R rated movie about VIOLENCE starring the guy from LORD OF THE RINGS?? Nuff said, I'm already forking over my ten bucks. This way the audience may actually be SURPRISED when some of these things happen. Imagine that. Wouldn't that be nice? Idiots.Now to the movie: I loved this movie. From the opening sequence A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE lets you know that 'it's not messing around'. This is a challenging, adult movie that could seemingly care less about appealing to the greater masses (14 year old fans of THE RING should sneak into another R rated movie). Croneberg and company threw caution to the wind and made a creepy, balls-out, little gem of a thriller that delves deep into questions that aren't easily answered. The story, as we already know from the trailers, more or less examines the destruction that violence has on one man and his family. This may sound like it's been done before but I can assure you there has never been anything quite like this. The scenes of violence, although chilling and expertly executed, are not what most disturbed me the most about this movie. It was witnessing the aftermath of these acts and seeing the characters try to regain some semblance of normalcy that was truly horrifying. This small premise was more than enough to keep me riveted and unnerved until the final fade to black. Which brings me to the ending. No eleventh hour twists here, no miraculous epiphanies, and no selling out for a happy ending. What a frigging' concept, a movie that ends when and how it should. Halellujah! SLIGHT SPOILER AHEAD I will never be able to shake the last few minutes of this movie; the fact that it was done with no words and very little on-screen action testifies to Cronenberg's talents and the strength of the script. Absolutely amazing, and in my mind it could not have been done any other way. I'm sure plenty of people walked out of this one feeling cheated and let down, expecting issues to be resolved and everything to be black and white. I for one thank the filmmakers for seeing their vision through to it's unsettling and quiet resolve, as any attempt to do otherwise would have undoubtedly cheapened the whole affair.SPOILER OVER All in all A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE is a great film, albeit packing less impact as a result of the plot-ruining trailers. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 was because of William Hurt's somewhat baffling performance (miscast), and some slight improbableness right before the aforementioned brilliant ending. A NOTE TO ALL FILMMAKERS, STUDIOS, AND DISTRIBUTION COMPANY'S: PLEASE MAKE MORE MOVIES LIKE THIS, AND DON'T REVEAL THE WHOLE PLOT IN THE TRAILERS!!",A History of Violence
526,Vulcan91,A Punch to the Stomach,9,14 October 2005,"A History of Violence Most of the people in the Raleigh theater that I was at were looking for a good way to have some fun on a Friday night. ""Ah, that one has 'violence' in the title, it should be entertaining."" Or maybe they just saw that it had ""that nice young man with the long hair from the hobbit movie"", and might be worth seeing.They never knew what hit them.I, however, had a secret weapon; a trick up my sleeve. I had seen a little film titled ""Naked Lunch"". I know David Cronenberg's game; you are searching for two hours of escapism, but what you get is a punch to the stomach, and in the end you leave the cinema scarred for live, yet for some reason wanting to go back and buy another ticket.Cronenberg brings his A-game with ""A History of Violence"", and the unsuspecting viewer will be shocked beyond belief at what they see. As the film unfolds, we find ourselves in the ultimate clichéd rural small town; a ""Pleasantville"" style place where everyone knows each other and most people will spend their entire lifetime living in peace in the same house. But as anyone who has seen the trailer, read a synopsis, or probably even read the title of the film knows, one of the residents of the town has a background unlike any of the others. Viggo Mortensen's 'Tom' is that character, and through the duration of the film, we see the transformation that violence sparks in him, and others connected to him.And as you might expect, Cronenberg is not afraid to show that violence, front and center. The violence in the film was extremely realistic, and the shock that the audience experiences is equal to that of the characters in the film. When a character is killed, it happens fast. In the blink of an eye, it is over, but the characters that remain standing are stunned. They stand frozen on the spot, unable to turn away from the horrifying sight, and the audience's reaction is similar, as the theater falls deadly silent (no pun intended).While the violence is terrible, and immediately abhorred by both the characters in the film and the audience, some of the characters display an innate attraction to violence. Maria Bello plays Tom's wife Edie, and there are a couple of somewhat disturbing scenes involving her that highlight this. More than once during the film, a violent encounter sparked a sudden burst of laughter throughout the audience, followed immediately by silence, as the effects of the actions seen on screen sank in. The film seems to be making a commentary on violence in the world, and the reactions of the audience confirm the authenticity of the reactions of the characters on screen.David Cronenberg has managed to direct a film that serves as both a well-paced, immensely entertaining thriller, and a thought provoking character study. Every shot is crafted to perfection, and amazing performances are pulled from most of the actors. Viggo Mortensen has said this is the best film he has ever been in, and I would certainly affirm that it is his best performance. Ed Harris is phenomenal, and puts on one of the best supporting performances of the year. ""A History of Violence"" is shocking, disturbing, eye-opening, humorous, and engaging, and I certainly will not be surprised if it receives a best picture nod this winter.4 stars (out of 4)",A History of Violence
527,carped,"So, where's the beef?",6,7 December 2005,"SPOILERS ALERT! Based on an enormous praise from the critics and IMDb comments, I had very high expectations before I came to the cinema. Critics were ranting about a deep message on the inherent violent nature that lies under the surface of a common man in America, about a subversive method of violence exploitation in that film. Unfortunately, I did not find in the film anything like that.The movie is based on a century old formula of a seemingly simple family man, who is forced to meet face to face with his dark violent past. Cronenberg managed to pull some weird laughs out of combination of gory violence and humor. This comes off like something really funny if you forget that Tarantino and many of his followers pulled this kind of tricks a little while ago.Granted, the story is told very well. Short outbursts of violence and sex are interlaced with spare moments of small-town ordinary life. The actors are all excellent. Viggo Mortensen is very good as coffee-shop keeper and a family man with a dark past, as well as all supporting characters. Ed Harris and William Hurt give outstanding performances as ruthless bad guys. But all this doesn't add up to a truly great picture. Just a fairly good modern film-noir, done with competent hands. One must have a whole different movie in his head to come up with the conclusions and generalizations that many critics came up with.Ultimately, the movie leaves you empty-handed, or empty-minded as a middle-of-the road thriller, high on promise and low on delivery.My rating: 6 out of 10.",A History of Violence

The acting seemed to me average but the story is intelligent an yes: violent. Anyway some thing confused me about this one, although the script was vertiginous, still the scenes looked rather slow. Another interesting but slightly unnecessary elements were the sex scenes between the main characters. It was remarkable to see the incredible Maria Bello in those scenes but from my point of view it din't add value to the story.Well, leaving aside the boring expectations, you'll surely enjoy this piece, and in the end you'll feel pleased to have rented it.

529,CarolWolf,Why is A History of Violence not a great film?,7,14 November 2005,"Why is History of Violence not a Great Film? by Carol Wolf ***full of spoilers***History of Violence should be a great film. Yet in the end, the parts do not add up. Tom Stall has been accepted back into his family, despite what they now know of his former life. He has seen the love in his wife's eyes. Why does that not feel like the end of the story? It is because it is not only her love that he must have, to rejoin his family. It is her acceptance.What she is taking back into her family is not only the husband she knew, but the monster part of him that, when last seen, she utterly rejected and sent from her room and her bed. After being thrown out of her room  though not her home  Tom has gone back to his old life and confronted and overcome the threat that had caught up with him. But his wife does not know that. To take back her husband, Edie must find it in her to trust and love all of him. That move has not been made, and until it is made, the story is unsatisfying and incomplete.Ultimately, this film falls short of its greatness because the writer failed to think through each of her scenes from the wife's point of view. Actions and reactions Edie should reasonably and truthfully have had are thus overlooked, and much of her behavior is excessive, unreasonable, and inexplicable. The beautiful and moving rendition of Tom's character is not there for Edie's. This is because the writer is looking at her only through Tom's eyes. The writer is not seeing Tom through hers.The key scene between Tom and Edie takes place in the hospital. Tom at last admits to his other identity, that of the gangster Joey Cusack. Edie's rejection of him and his circumstances is total: upon hearing his admission, she vomits. But consider: Edie last saw Tom take on three armed men and very expertly kill two of them before his son killed the third. Before that, she saw him unhesitatingly law down his gun and give himself up to the men who wanted to kill him, in return for the life of his son. What she saw was his willingness to sacrifice himself for his family, and his prowess as a warrior against evil men who threatened his family and himself. So why would she vomit?What the scene should have been about was not Edie's rejection of Tom/Joey, but the question of how they are to go on together in the face of the lies that he told, the danger he embodies. Most importantly, are we still in danger? Will more evil men threaten us because of Joey?When Tom comes home from the hospital he is again confronted by Edie, who provokes him into manhandling her. This escalates into a conflict with sex as the weapon, wherein she gives as good as she gets. After the climax of this scene she rejects his touch and ejects him from her bedroom.It is a great scene, but once again, it is off target. One can see the effect the writer is getting at, but he has missed, again, because he has not thought through the scene from each characters' points of view, but only from Tom's.A woman who discovers she is married to a killer needs to know, more than anything else  under what circumstances will he turn on me? The scene that followed should have been one question and one answer after another  If I do this, will you hurt me? If I need you to, will you let me go? If I want to stop now, will you stop?  which would tell her whether she should get near this man ever again, or not. Having powerful passionate sex together simply begs the story. For her to engage him, provoke him, couple with him, and then reject him, is inexplicable.The other question that lies between these two is, will any more bad men come here to threaten us because of Joey? Tom is never asked to make the choice to go for the sake of his family. Why not? If Edie has rejected his touch and ejected him from her bedroom, why has she not asked him to go and take his evil associations with him? Thus, Tom is asleep on the couch when his mobster brother calls. A far stronger choice for the writer to have made would be for Tom/Joey to chose to turn again, to call his brother, and go and face the monster in his lair. That decision would show Joey to be a hero: Joey has indeed become Tom. Instead, he responds to his brother's call; he goes where he is told. It's a much weaker action, and it weakens the character. Tom arrives back home the next day at dinner time. For him, the world has changed. He has won free of his past. For Edie, nothing has changed. None of her questions have been answered, none of her problems resolved. If she had told him, in a previous scene, all right, I love you, but until you don't represent a danger to my family, you go and don't come back  then his return would be her answer, and he could symbolically lay the head of the monster at her feet. If the writer had served Edie's character as well as he served Tom/Joey's, Maria Bello would have been able to give a performance with as much beautiful precision, depth and passion as Viggo Mortensen. The scenes would have torn up our hearts, the ending would have been completely satisfying, and History of Violence would be a really great movie.",A History of Violence

I never thought I'd see a Cronenberg film with wifey, hubby and 2.5 perfect kids sitting down to a meatloaf...and the meatloaf wasn't even an insect/primate hybrid or made from talking cancer cells!

The resolution of the ""problems"", caused by those who are terrorizing him and his family members, that is used by Tom Stall, shows us that the only permanent solution to terrorists is to eliminate terrorist nations. When you are attacked, as Tom was, you must not only fight back, you must also completely wipe out those who are at the root of the terrorism, no matter what your previous diplomatic relations may have been. Of course, for those who believe we can reason with terrorists to cure the problem, then continue to evaluate the film as you initially do.I also agree that the acting and staging were very well done and the picture should get an Academy Award, but ""Holywood"" will surely ignore it.

532,dave94703,A title sure to be misunderstood,8,1 October 2005,"I had a devil of a time convincing my movie friend to go to see this jewel, because he was sure it was a documentary. It is not. The movie doesn't tell THE history of violence. The title is a wryly understated play on the characterization in pseudo-psychiatric evaluations that explains why people who outwardly seem to be relatively functional members of society nonetheless commit heinous crimes: ""the subject has a history of violence"" (the way you'd use it in a sentence like ""Cronenberg has a history of making his audiences uncomfortable"").It's as if violence were an addictive habit that the weak-willed can't quite get a handle on. While your average discontented male manages to suppress the desire to take out his everyday frustrations directly on their objects, in some, the characterization implies, the impulse is too strong, or the ability to suppress too weak, and their lives (and police records) are dotted with outbreaks of fistfights and mayhem.And indeed the men in this movie all have such histories, or create them before our eyes. Yet in each case the relationship to violence is distinctly different. Two characters are inured to it and almost comically blasé; one has by dint of extreme effort weaned himself from that sort of indifference; and one is pushed to violence despite his heroic efforts to avoid it.So the stereotype is wrong. (Isn't it by now itself something of a stereotype that stereotypes are wrong?) Except for the psychopathic, our relationship to violence isn't inherent and expressed by how often we resort to it, but rather is mediated by how much of it presents itself in our lives and how we end up dealing with it. And inasmuch as it provides an outlet for suppressed anger, it's cathartic and, as Cronenberg enjoys illustrating, can as a byproduct lead to the exploration of uncharted waters for women as well. (Okay, I enjoyed that scene too.)Cronenberg isn't out to make us squirm with irresolvable moral dilemmas. Except for the psychopaths' victims (who appear briefly and with a minimum of on-screen mutilation), the victims in this movie all have it coming big time. If we're made to feel uncomfortable, it's because the payback is simultaneously sweet and gory, and it's hard to reconcile totally contradictory gut-level reactions. One thing is abundantly clear: if you're going to make a movie where your central character meets up with a whole bunch of violence, he better be exquisitely trained and have a preternatural feel for it, or the comedic aspects of the experience just won't come across well.",A History of Violence
533,LThomas72,"Man, Viggo Mortensen is hot...",8,1 October 2005,"So it's a Cronenburg film that feels like De Palma and, in the same way that Mr Lynch shucked off his trademark noir-weirdness and made his best movie ever, with 'A History of Violence' Cronenburg may well have made his own 'The Straight Story'. It's a poignant, thoughtful, honest portrayal of a family going through hell, made all the more emotive because - with just a few carefully drawn scenes - Cronenburg actually makes you care for them. At times the relationship between Tom (Mortensen) and wife Evie (Bello) is even close to cliché; that they're still so passionately in love even after 16 years or so of marriage is well...kind of implausible, but the dialogue between them is so emotive and simply written that you buy it. You buy it all. They have a delicious little girl, a sensitive, smart teenage son (Ashton Holmes) who's being bullied by the school jerk because of it, they have friends, a community who give a toss about each other, they even pick up litter on the streets of their own town. They're living the dream. Then one day, two guys try to hold up Tom's Diner, and the dream falls apart.Without even breaking a sweat, Tom kills the two guys in cold blood, quickly, ruthlessly and - it seems - without a moment's pause for thought. He's an American hero, his picture on every newscast on every channel and suddenly it all starts to unravel. Men arrive in town who say that he's someone else - a legendarily psychotic young mobster called Joey Cusack - and, when he denies it, only seem to become more determined to prove they're right. Suddenly Tom's idyllic small-town existence is shattered and, with only the elderly sheriff as protection from real-life mobsters, his family's lives are suddenly under threat. Which would be terrifying, if everything they believed about him wasn't true.This is a great film, because it's simple and because Cronenburg - better than most directors I think - understands what scares us. I can't go to a gynaecologist since I saw 'Dead Ringers' and I still can't look at oxygen masks in the same way since 'Blue Velvet', and I know that, when I have a family of my own, I will be terrified of anything that will threaten them. That Tom (Joey) is able to defend his family and protect his home from his ugly past is made all the more poignant because, in the closing moments of the movie, you understand that he hasn't. He's lost his family and his perfect life forever because of who he was and who - it seems - he still is. If there's a hidden tag-line to this movie, I'm guessing it's 'you can run from your past, but you can't hide', but maybe that's simplifying it a little. It may be a visceral film, but it has all Cronenburg's trademark complex subtext. It's both brutal and subtle in the same way as Mortensen's acting - the way he flips between the lovable, aw-shucks Tom Stall and the razor-edged Joey is really astounding. A great thriller with a fantastic climax.",A History of Violence

But, this movie as awful...and the full theater in which I watched this littering of celluloid...all who exited the theater sounded out the same conclusion..lousy and not worth the money they paid to see it. Tha film is LOUSY. Not on the actor's abilities, but on the script and direction. Its bloody, and painfully slow. Underacted with a script that even the best actors, past andpresent, would not be able to save. It drags on and on, then you get a close up and personal view of violent gun shots hitting their mark, then slides back down to BORING!! It does this throughout the movie. Thes story is just plain stupid and uninteresting. The only possible saving grace of the movie...for the females anyway, is the gratuitous butt shot of Viggo. There is no chemistry between Viggo and his leading lady. Its totally predictable from the first few scenes where this was headed,and it did nothing but get worse the longer it played. Don't get me wrong..I wasn't expecting Lord of the Rings, a movie that is totally incompatible....but it doesn't even come anyway near the types of powerful performances that I have seen Viggo give. It was a total loss of money and time, and not even worth the $7 I forked out for the movie. Either the director or the screen play writer managed to get get some good actors and stick them in a movie that could only be saved by a rewrite, as in major overhaul. I am sure that the glowing reviews I see are being sent by people who blindly feel if Viggo is in it, it has to be outstanding. Well, I am a die-hard Viggo fan myself, but I cannot tell a lie....this was one of the most boring and anticlimactic waste of a movie with a good cast, I have seen in a while.

Well, I just watched it again, hoping that I was simply wrong and it was better than I had originally felt. After all, I do enjoy Viggo and Maria Bello a lot and maybe I was just in a bad mood when I first saw it.But I had the same problems the second time too. The opening scene simply exists to introduce two very unpleasant characters. They have already killed a couple who run a motel; when one of the bad guys goes back to steal something or other, the couple's daughter appears and she is going to be killed as well. This whole sequence was completely unnecessary to the narrative. These two unpleasant characters could have shown up at Tom's cafe with no introduction and done the same things. So the opening scene has literally nothing to do with the rest of the film other than prepare us for ugliness.And from then on, once again I was confronted with one cliché scene after another, ""I know you're really Joey"" ""No, you're mistaken I am Tom"" etc., leading to two violent bloodbaths. Oh, and Tom's kid can suddenly and miraculously beat up bullies. At the very end Tom goes home and no one can speak at the dinner table. Whoa. Really profound. Reviewers go on about how there is a ""sense of menace"" throughout the film -- I never felt anything but tedium. The movie held no surprises and goes nowhere that I haven't seen in many films before. Yet that means it is ""ironic"" and ""distanced""?

Not that there's anything wrong with that.However, here is a very different movie from Cronenberg, and many are saying it's his most accomplished work yet.I'm very conscious about directors when I watch a film, because I know that all of the style and substance of the work involved goes through them. David Cronenberg comes to my mind as one of the best, even if he is a bit kooky with the effects sometimes (not so much in this film, see ""Videodrome"" etc.) Even if you aren't a fan, you should know this isn't his campy style, it's a rather serious story. Nevertheless, it is still ""a trip"" for lack of a better cliché. Only a ""ten out of ten"" film can make me sad and angry, then have me laughing (not throughout, just around the end.) This is definitely a film worthy of that score. It has the thoughtful pacing and awkward humanity of something like David Lynch would make, alongside the intense aggression and eye for gore of something out of a Tarentino film.More important than those comparisons, though, it is just a great story with good acting all around. Definitely the best picture at the box office for the time being, and will hopefully get some nominations. It's an excellent thriller that steers clear of the standard Hollywood formulaic nonsense.Anybody thinking about taking their teens (hopefully not younger kids) to this should be warned that there are some very elaborate and LONG sex scenes (they're quite good though... heh!) Also, it IS still a Cronenberg movie, and David does not skimp on the blood and gore. Just a warning for the squeamish and/or the timid.",A History of Violence

He tells the couple that he has researched story out of Philadelphia, the biographies, violence, disappearance of Joey after a violent attack on mobster Fogaty ,Ed Harris,...The Sheriff,Sam's role in town , is to maintain the calm,law abiding citizenry, as he tells Fogaty...""We'll keep an eye on you!"" Then we see him in the mall, eying Edie and the daughter,implying threat to Stall's family, despite his intent, to bring Joey back to Philly to confront his issues there. It disturbs me that the Sheriff disappears from the plot/storyline, after he states his increasing interest in,concern for Tom's/Joey's history and their AFFECT upon his role in Millbrook, today and in the future...WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN/will be the Sheriff's confrontation with Tom/Joey after Sam reads the NEWS from Philly, of which we learn he has more than a nodding familiarity and an Eminent Domain responsibility..PLEASE writers of scripts for film, don't introduce and then drop characters like hot potatoes; if they are significant, as Sam appears to be, then bring closure...YES, I agree.

540,Kleister-Meister,Convincing family drama of crime and violence,8,21 September 2010,"Is it possible to start a new life when you have a history of violence? This is the topic of David Cronenberg's movie ""A History of Violence"" in which Tom, the father of a family, becomes a local hero after killing two people who wanted revenge for something Tom did in his past as ""Joey Cusack"". Always in struggle with both the criminals who want revenge and his own family members (especially his wife) who lose their trust in Tom, a dramatic try to correct his life leads to a last violent conflict with his past.The movie is a well acted drama of a not that typical American family questioning integration with a violent history.

541,zenpunks,A History of nothing else....,3,14 April 2017,"...sums it up for me. I didn't have a great deal of expectation as I got to see this movie for free on Amazon Prime -missed it when it was first out. The film is 12 years old but it's bad now and for it's time -as much as movies have changed and audiences have gotten smarter -it doesn't matter a well done movie is a well done movie period from any time and this isn't! I agree with all the previous reviews in why the movie is lacking: underdeveloped story and characters - ridiculous action scenes that lack suspense, surprise and might as well be in slow motion -sex scenes and full frontal nudity that are completely out of place and no real history to the characters beside Toms'(Viggo Mortensen) ""history of violence"" which isn't ever really fully explained -he screwed with bad people in his shady past- I don't care enough about the character to care! I'd be more interested in how he came to this small town and chose to stay, how he met his wife and how they fell in love and the changes that happen to him as he becomes a husband, a father and a better person. All of that is just assumed in a sophomoric connect the dots kind of way as should be expected based on a graphic novel -there is a deeper, fuller, much better story here that's never realized -it's too bad cause David Cronenberg has done much better work (check out The Dead Zone) - (*spoiler alert*) the whole killing off of the 3 bad guys (including Ed Harris' character) and how that is swept under the rug -where is the town reaction, news etc. -after such a big deal was made about Tom being a hero??? someone already in the spotlight would have even more attention on them just days later after a triple murder on their property??? I feel like this movie should have been much longer and should have taken at least 30-40 minutes or more to establish itself and Tom's life in small town (Millbrook, Indiana) America -before the bad guys show up (Think of the movie Witness and why we care about the characters...) And yes the movie has violence and to me it doesn't matter or work for the film - like Quentin Tarantino's movies are often violent but because they are so well done and you care about the characters the violence is a working part of the story and doesn't degrade it. This movie lacks everything: story, real characters and even violence that matters or works!!",A History of Violence
542,Whadever,This is not a thriller.,4,14 August 2020,"I saw this movie years ago and liked it. At least I think I did.
After seeing it again tonight, I find it lacking in several areas.
The acting is far below par. I've seen many great child-actors at play in movies but the Stall daughter is not one of them also the son and wife become completely unrelatable somewhere halfway through the movie.
Only Viggo & Ed seem to make it to the end without any real damage... too bad the plot steals Ed's spotlight.
Speaking of the plot I found it paper thin and cannot comprehend what it is that some other reviewers liked about it.
Maybe they were fans of the graphic novel?
Style-wise Cronenberg makes a good effort, especially at first but then the plot turns to mush and no style-elements can save it.To me this was not a thriller. For it to be a thriller I'd have to care for the main characters. When I see actors acting, I'm not seeing the people in a story.
After 15 minutes and some horrible child-acting lines I gave it a 6/10.
By half time only a 5 or so was left... for me the movie ends on a 4/10.
I will not be watching this again. Ever.",A History of Violence
543,Grkmagas85,WHat's going on with viewers today? MAJOR SPOILERS!,1,17 October 2005,"I can't believe this movie is getting such good reviews, I finally saw it today. *** SPOILERS********** Alright, so the movie starts off with a shot of a chair, then the director spends ten minutes extra trying to get us to understand that this is a loving family, done. Tom Stall, played horribly by Viggo Mortensen is a former criminal from the east, Philadelphia to be more specific. He has successfully relocated to a small town in Indiana and all is well - until his diner gets robbed. Tom reverts to his instincts and kills the two men and now he's a hero. Took long enough to get to this part, now we see Tom Stall's son getting bullied in school and playing baseball, very useless if you ask me, doesn't do anything for the story. Ed Harris shows up at Tom's diner claiming he's ""JOE CUSACK"". We know the bad guys want TOm, why is not yet known. After some pointless sex scenes, yeah married couple performing 69, the bad guys finally reach Tom at his house. Tom goes psycho and kills all the men after we FIND OUT Tom's brother, Richie, wants to see him. This is mind you 50 minutes into the script, NOW we find out Richie wants to see Tom or Joe, whichever. Tom has some make up sex with his wife on the steps which is so out-of-place it's not even funny. Very unnatural dialogue also detracts from this film. Tom's son suspects of his past, and tells his father, who mind you has been good to him all these years: ""WHat are you gonna do, WACK ME? Like those two guys in the diner"". LOL! What's that? A son saying that to his father after he killed two men in self defense, trust me, the dialogue is horrible, and so is the acting. We're now well into the third act, we still don't know why these ppl want Tom for, finally Tom visits his brother Richie. Turns out, all Richie needed to do was call his brother up, yep that's right - A PHONE CALL. No need to send five guys to get killed when you can just call your brother up. Alright, he calls him up and Tom meets RIchie at his HUGE MANSion. We now finally figure out the reason for all this VIOLENCE> Tom was crazy back in phili and he killed a bunch of dudes, now RICHIE can't move up in the criminal world because of his brothers actions. EVEN Though he has a huge mansion and lives well, his brother being alive is messing everything up! SO, instead of leaving his brother alone in Indina, he decides it would be better to kill him. Yeah, he's as good as gone in Indiana, but NO! He wants to kill him. SO Richie attempts to have Tom killed and Tom of course kills everyone in the mansion. He goes back home and lives happily ever after. Very bad dialogue, very bad direction, very bad acting. 4/10 stars NEXT!!!!!!!",A History of Violence
544,lord2480,"Great performances, but plot a bit thin.",8,5 October 2005,"History of Violence has some great performances. I love Mortenson, Harris and Hurt, but the plot seemed a little too thin in the end. Reason why it seemed a bit thin was because it's hard too tell if Mortenson was Joey or Tom. It seemed like he was a witness protection program for awhile. I kept thinking which guy is the villain. The performances are great. I love Foggerty's bruised eye and Mortenson saying ""Jesus Ritchie"". The violence is flawless and understandable. Go Viggo Mortenson for an Oscar Nomination Overall, i give this flick an 8/10Joe Calahan",A History of Violence
545,brillpro,History of Violences leaves lots of questions such as WHY?,5,30 September 2005,"""History of Violence, if you believe the trailers, is a really hot film. Hot enough after seeing it to believe Viggo Mortensen should burn it from his resume. I almost walked out but being the kinda guy I am, hoping for some redeeming features or plot twists, I stuck it out. Not such a good move.Viggo wasn't bad. He's usually so good in everything even if he's become a little stilted lately. Not like his earlier work in Ruby Cairo, or the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Maria Bello was terrific everywhere along the way showing a very strong sense of emotion to her ever confused character. Even Ashton Holmes who plays their teen-aged son was good. Daughter Heide Hayes didn't have much to do so it's hard to judge.The script was lackluster, the editing purely was atrocious and there was so little emotion to the writing it just left you flat and wondering why? The premise was strong. A small town and well liked family man who runs a diner goes Stallone on two murdering thugs who threaten to kill everyone in the place. He kills them both and becomes an American hero.The television crews show up. Well sort of. His story is on local TV, the networks and CNN (you see this as he flips channels from his hospital room) but there are no crews waiting for him at the hospital. WRONG! One TV crew is waiting at his house. WRONG! And they never come back again. WRONG! C'mon a common guy does this and the networks are seen covering the story on television but no news crews show up? Where was this director? The guys who do show up are Ed Harris (typically cool) and his mobster buddies. Turns out our perfect local is a long lost hit-man for the mob in Philadelphia. Of course he denies it and the rest of the locals are not really involved except the town sheriff. He asks ""Are you in a witness protection program?"" Viggo ends up killing these killers too. In all, he kills 11 people in the film in between two not so bad sex scenes with wife Bello. Both are pretty gratuitous as is the violence but the first one is pretty well done. If you play the numbers game 69 sex in an R rated movie is pushing the envelope. It was nicely done though. In the second the women get a treat by seeing a lengthy shot of Viggo's naked butt and afterward the guys are treated to a full frontal nude shot of Bello. If any of that is offensive to you, I must remind you they were probably the best shot scenes in the film.The movie drags, and while the director may play it off as people being confused and going through a wide range of emotions the viewer sees it as, ""will somebody please get to the point in this clunker?."" The tell tale sign is when the audience gets up and leaves at the beginning of the credits not half way through.William Hurt pulls off a role as an aging gangster very well. Viggo continues to play Stallone though as this kid from the streets of Philadelphia who has been living in small town Indiana for 20 years uses Jackie Chan-like quickness in disposing of the 11 guys he kills. This is the same guy who races home limping as he goes because in the first scene one of the guys he kills stabs him in the foot. He's out of the hospital in a few hours and the next day is running a couple miles to his house to save his family. The cold hearted killer didn't even think about grabbing a vehicle? The film ending leaves you with lots of questions the director wants you to think about. Well here are some questions I want answers to. First, if Viggo owns a diner and wife Bello is a local hot shot lawyer, why do they live in a dumpy house and have only a pick-up truck. Why does Viggo walk a mile or so into town along a country road to work carrying his soft brief case? Second, why after Viggo and son kill Harris and his two thugs in the family front yard is there no crime scene wrap up or more TV crews, and why is the local sheriff talking to him about these Philadelphia gangsters as if he doesn't know they are dead.Did Viggo and son dispose of the bodies and act like nothing happened or did they leave out the police coming and taking care of the bodies, and the investigation afterward.And finally and most importantly, why did I spend $9.50 to see this piece of junk? Oh yea, I like Viggo. I like Bello even more but I doubt I'll ever see another David Cronenberg film again.",A History of Violence
546,Icarus8,uneven from good to bad,5,1 April 2006,"I had heard a lot of good reviews on this movie and I was definitely expecting a lot. So maybe that was my problem with this movie, too high of an expectation. The general storyline is of a simple family man that has his hidden violent past come back looking for him. However, each individual scene's directing, acting, characters and point went from dramatic to comical, well-done to amateurish, Oscar to Razzberry. The family scenes for the most part were well done but any of the scenes involving Tom Stall's past were cartoonish and exaggerated. Ed Harris and his goons in the black car were so cliché and boring. William Hurt was completely miscast-ed and horrible with his ""My Cousin Vinnie"" accent and dialog. The good was Mortenson and Bello who exhibited great controlled intensity and passion in their characters and acting. Back to the bad, the son's conflict with the school bully. While watching the scenes between the ""wimpy"" son and his antagonist, I had a flashback to the 80's and almost retched. Think Biff in ""Back to the Future"" meets Cobra Kai from ""Karate Kid"", it was horrible. Add his misfit ""girlfriend"" and you got ""Pretty in Pink"". All in all I was disappointed and incredulous at the high ratings and reviews this movie received.",A History of Violence
547,trinnisia,Great,8,19 November 2005,"I watched it yesterday and I thing this is a great movie. The film is rather short, but during this 1,5 hour we can see what influence has the violence on Tom's family. This is the film I will remember for a long time because it's different than other movies. In ""History of violence"" we can't expect what happen next. Even the end of the movie was surprising. Ed Harris, Maria Bello and of especially Viggo Mortensen done the excellent job. This movie is not only about Tom. His whole family has to face the violence in different ways. It also proves that we can't eliminate the violence even in such a small town like this. After ""History of violence"" I started to wonder if we can be absolutely sure that we know other person. This movie contents a lot of violence and I think this is the reason why it is so real. I can recommend this movie to all.",A History of Violence
548,1640abt,Dismal thriller,2,23 October 2005,"A dismal little thriller masquerading as art. Incompetently plotted and crudely executed it's the kind of piece that seems designed to make people who can't think believe themselves to be intellectuals. Also, it is astonishingly right-wing; a fable of red-state, 'family-values' America invaded by baddies from the wicked blue states. Yet another example of Hollywood acting, unwittingly or not, as propagandist for the most repulsive aspects of the contemporary USA. A couple of specifics: Clearly no-one involved in making this film has ever actually been to a small town. Leaving aside the way the actors look - as if they spend their lives on a stairmaster - it would seem that the only contact any of them has actually had with Indiana is to fly over it. And second; the ages! If the hero's son is 16 or 17 and he had been 'in the desert' for four years before he met his future wife then he has to be at least 50. They can't even get that right. As for the sex scenes, all they prove is that sexism is alive and well and living in Cronenberg movies. The woman loses her knickers but the man retains his boxers.Save the ticket money and rent 'Funny Games' instead. Superior in every way imaginable.",A History of Violence
549,garvneil,They come around eventually................,9,5 December 2005,"By far Cronenbergs' most accessible feature to date, A History of Violence could still manage to deter viewers with its extremely visceral violence and sex. This is Cronenbergs most focused and composed film to date. Yet coupled in the film are bursts of violent anger with displays of composure, both distilled in Mortissens character. It is a towering performance from the Lord of the Rings star. The transformation throughout the film is one which the viewer shares with his family. We are taken on a journey, one which can be very unsettling and thrilling at the same time. Mortissen has the ability to convey a sense of restricted passion and potential violence and can then unleash it on the audience with ferocious intensity. The film examines the roles and significance of both sex and in particular violence in our daily lives and the fashion in which they are dealt with in the media. It plays on our own in built reactions to scenes containing Mortissen getting the upper hand with violent crooks. We are presented with harsh violence in these scenes however the 'good guy' wins therefore it is justified in many eyes. It is this aspect of the film which is masterly woven by the director. We move from simply passive viewers to viewers that ultimately have to think about what we are looking at and more significantly the way we are assimilating it. Maria Bello plays the part of the wife with a humanity she has shown in her previous film The Cooler with William H. Macy. The second sex scene is very important thematically. Mortissen has become a local hero due to his courageous and clinically violent actions during a stick-up in the coffee shop he owns. A subsequent act of violence in the film leads her to question her husbands past. The sex scene is the result of two conflicting emotions, the first being fear of what her husband is capable of, the second being fascination with her husbands violent capabilties and strength. The final scene of the film is very poignant without being melodramatic. The beauty of this ending is in the way we, the audience, have to make the final choice with the family. Should we accept Mortissen back knowing all about his violent past or discard him as damaged goods? A History of Violence is a film that needs to be seen. It does what all good film should do for audiences, that is to make them think, react and to think some more. Cronenberg manages to thrill on an intellectual level and on a more base violent level. Amidst all the dross being released at the moment, A History of violence stands out as a beacon of hope for all us movie goers.",A History of Violence
550,themoviebuff2003,It's Only A Gangster Movie..It's Only a Gangster Movie..,4,4 June 2006,"Keep saying that to yourself, because that's all this is. Just a forties/fifties type/style gangster film, with modern gratuitous sex and gore thrown in for good measure. Good direction, great acting by Ed Harris as a sadistic mobster,, otherwise... just a halfway decent gangster movie. It just cracks me up how much deep psychological meaning crap people try to read into this movie. Watchable, yes. Slightly better than average, yes. But I'll have forgotten it within the next few months. I would have given it a six rating, if it hadn't been for the needless sex scenes, which detracted from the movie. Of course, there are those here who see the 'inner meaning' who will swear to you the sex scenes 'explain the relationship'. They're wrong. Better done than most of Scorcese's or Coppolla's repetitive mobster crap, but, in the end, just a fairly well-done gangster movie. Don't believe the hype. It's not a bad movie, just not fantastic. An aside-the one crazy in the beginning of the movie looks like Wes Craven! I don't know if that was intentional on Cronenberg's part or not. I don't consider that a 'spoiler', but I'm not sure just how strict the mods are here, so I thought I'd better play it safe. 8^D",A History of Violence
551,losdzez,I highly recommend this film.,9,25 September 2005,"I have to disagree with the assessment of another reviewer here that Viggo Mortensen ""didn't fit the role"". In fact, his being sort of an ""everyman"" with which we can easily identify makes him an excellent choice for this part. It is crucial that he be someone ""like us"".In addition, there is an economy to the film that is echoed in Mortensen's subtle (what I will call) character ""arc"". It's not really an evolution of his character but a demarcation, a border he passes back and forth over, that he reveals with a deft and nuanced performance. This film is about the way we as a culture view violence, how we find ways to justify it, how we even find satisfaction in violence despite protestations to the contrary. In some spots in the film the audience laughed or cheered, I felt, inappropriately - until I realized that was the point. We as audience, as culture, applaud violence and laugh at the concept of mediating differences instead of resorting to violence. Violence is so much more entertaining . . .And so as we watch we want to find a way to forgive the violence, to justify the behavior, so we can get it all to go back to where it was. But something is unleashed, something that existed just under the surface all along, something terrible and frightening and exciting and for Tom's wife Edie, maybe even a little sexy . . .My biggest critique of the film is that there are portions which were clichéd to the point where we find ourselves laughing but I found myself out of the film for a moment, as these moments felt jarring. Ed Harris' character seems like it came out of a graphic novel rather than from somewhere in Tom and Edie's world. John Hurt is even further out there, taking us into some sort of campy mobster film that almost seems unrelated to the film we were just watching. The scenes just didn't fit with what the film up to that point told us was ""the world"". Perhaps the point is that (a) that IS the same world, (b) violence (even as solution) only begets violence and (c) these characters' blasé attitude about violence reflects the way we as a culture seem to be able to view or even take part in the most horrendous violence and then move on to ""what's for dinner?"" But the fact that this other world seems so foreign and jarring is also testament to the connection that Cronenberg masterfully builds between us and Tom Stall and his family. We'll forgive anything for the possibility of having that perfect, comforting little family back, even if it is illusion.Cronenberg makes sure we see and understand the reality of the violence, the aftermath both physical and psychological. But he doesn't batter us with it. Even with a certain degree of mayhem, he still manages to sneak up on us and tap us on the shoulder, so he can remind us quietly that this is our world, our family, our patriarch, our violence. ""Oh, crap,"" we say, ""he's right.""And then, ""what's for dinner?""",A History of Violence
552,TVGoHome123,Difficult to Say,7,23 January 2006,"When I seen this for the first time in a long time I was speechless, however maybe not for all the right reasons. David Cronenberg has had an accomplished career of making films that are challenging to watch and, yet somehow in their own peculiar way, often awarding. I usually find it quite difficult to enjoy the visceral nature of his films but in this case it was a main plot device and therefore an essential rather than an option. Firstly the parts are well acted and up to major twist in the film the plot ticks along nicely keeping the viewer intrigued. This film will feel after the first time you watch as clique ridden for the first twenty minutes; so clique ridden in fact it become apparent that it is done deliberately. In time you realise that Cronenberg is making an unconventional thriller which has to be appreciated in this day and age. The reason that I did not endear myself to this film as much it that I found the scenes towards the end very unrewarding and cartoonish (understandable however when considered that this is based upon a graphic novel). Basically I think that even though I did not enjoy this film as much as others I have seen this year I find that by making a film as challenging as this Cronenberg is doing something which he and David Lynch are almost alone in doing so; making mainstream films which challenge the viewer rather than spoon-feed them the usual predictable stuff which culminates in the overall dumbing down of mainstream movies; which is admirable in itself.Rating: Definitely worth a watch and maybe a second watch to get the best out it.",A History of Violence

This is one of those films you just want to pop the play button without reading too many reviews. Nothing short of a raw array of emotions are displayed inside these frames. A nice touch of gore that isn't too overbearing, just enough to keep things interesting. After all, the title does include the word violence.With that being said, I definitely consider this to be an adult only film because the subtle leads into the murder and sex scenes are just bittersweet.

The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars and not 1 is because it was so bad that it was funny and did provide me with some amusement. For example: the rough sex on the stairs after he lunged at her throat and pinned her to the wall was hysterical! My fiancé, everyone else in the auditorium and I were laughing. And that really was not supposed to be funny. At all. Also the ""let me run home on my injured foot and actually beat the bad guys who are driving"" scene was ridiculous. And laughable. And the ""gee gosh golly sis are you OK after having a bad dream"" 15 year old son who sits outside of a building by a fairly busy intersection with his friend, the stereotypical crazy-haired, sneer-faced teenage girl with ridiculous clothes, smoking pot... who sits on main street smoking pot? The only quasi-good thing about the movie was the random violence. And there wasn't enough of it to make me like the movie.Overall, it was slow. The (almost nonexistent) plot was slow, the characters walked slow, talked slow, thought slow. The script was horrible. The acting was terrible.

If you were amazed by his performance in LOTR than please i beg you do not watch this movie. He was asleep half the movie. At some points i had to turn the volume right up just to hear his dialog i'm sorry but i think the fame got to his head.Enough of the bad.

Step two is making sure it has a good plot or good substance. Done. Vigo is a great, creepy, violent character. He was cool back in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre days, this shouldn't be new information to you.So I liked how it started because it made you think the movie was about the two killers in the early scenes. Then you get to know Vigo a little and how he's undercover gangster. The way he killed people made Steven Segal look like a punk. Then you have the bad guys who I happened to like until they introduced his brother. His brother was kind of funny but maybe that's what a dumb Irish gangster is like. Anyhow, Vigo's son was the bomb. One of the best scenes was when his father took the shotgun out of his hands. The dead silence throughout that scene and other scenes actually was thought-provoking. I think that dead silence meant ""ok son, gimme the gun, because u just killed a made man and you officially have the gene....I love you but this is badddd, come here, thank you."" The scene almost brought a tear to my eye. I love violence and Vigo was good at it in this movie. I only wished they could have made it more violent because it made me fiend for more.

558,LeightWinst,Excellent. But...............,8,4 April 2006,"An excellent, excellent film. But before anyone starts going, ""It's based on a comic book,suspend your rational thinking!"", I'm well aware of that.But........As I have read on other comments made, there are some matters not fully developed that perhaps should have been. For example, the full story of why Viggo fell out with Ed Harris (because he was crazy just didn't ring true for me),the Hospital confessional(was over a little too quickly) and the complete lack of Police investigation into one man and the MULTIPLE murders he has committed.But no more, here comes the positives!What the film is, is a serious discussion about the merits and non merits of violence in society, and the affects it has there-on. Especially in a small town where people ""Look after their own."" The violence in question, is explosive,exacting and not at all glamorous. It is used for reason.The performances are terrific, notables being Viggo Moretenstein and Maria Bello. And Ed Harris, is, well, Ed Harris(Superb in everything). One of note, and I mean note, is William Hurt. Oscar worthy he was not. He's good, but Oscar worthy? If anyone should have been nominated it should have been Viggo and Maria. Cronenberg has not made a David Cronenberg film,which I think is good for all film makers who have such distinct styles and are often associated with a particular 'brand' of film making, and has made a very, very good film as a result.Excellent.",A History of Violence

Viggo's son making a ""statement of the obvious"".. well people frequently do in real life, and in the movie it's a believable part of the flow. A couple fighting then having sex on the stairs, unrealistic? Well, from what I'm aware of from surveys, couples frequently have the best sex after having a row.. Characters like the school bully seeming like clichés? well, surprisingly, quite a few people in real life do seem like clichés, which is where the clichés came from. And that part (and every other) is played without any self-conscious irony/ nods to the audience, in fact everything is quite believable within the parameters of the movie.",A History of Violence
560,karen_a_k,A Masterpiece !,9,18 February 2007,"I do not like violent movies. Most ""action movies"" are a complete waste of time. No story worth mentioning and the emphasis on testosterone, big guns and big explosions. That's why it has taken me 2 years of internal debate. The only ""pro viewing"" argument was that Viggo Mortensen was in it. Well, I shouldn't have doubted his choice of script. This movie is a masterpiece! The violence and brutality are presented in such a matter of fact way, they seem to be inevitable, even appropriate. The bad guys are truly scary without having to brandish big guns or display muscle. They just ARE scary. I'm sure this is one of Ed Harris' best performances and I have never seen such a brilliant William Hurt. All the characters are convincing and superbly cast. Well, I could have done with less sex scenes but they were well done and so that was OK too.The music by Howard Shore is just perfect. Unobtrusive but supportive. Had I known that the music was by Howard Shore that would have been another ""pro viewing"" point.Can I recommend the movie ? To those over 18 and not squeamish - yes.9/10",A History of Violence

Pros : good story, great characters. The Cons : Not enough Ed Harris (he was the best character and an extraordinary actor)- where was he? Mortensen's character was never developed enough- he remained a mystery up to the final credits, some meaningless and disturbing sex scenes, and basically a juvenile script with some laughable lines. Start over take these wonderful actors, storyline, learn a lesson, and expand a bit here Cronenberg- you've been around too long for such a mediocre effort.

I found some of the scripting to be quite cringe worthy and unrealistic and some of the early scenes were quite poorly acted out especially in relation to those stories that relating to the family and children. On the plus side in the action/violent scenes and the development of the main character,who was acted more bearably than other characters throughout, was interesting. The one plus in terms of the story and style of presentation in violent/ tense scenes was that there were some minor reflections of the movie and TV series Fargo which kept me just about interested enough to stay watching to the end.",A History of Violence
563,robhastings1000,Bewildering - in a good way,8,6 December 2005,"From the very first camera shot, this film is completely engrossing. It is also rarely anything less than bewildering. This is a quality that comes in many different forms in the movies; the tangled plot chronology of Pulp Fiction, or the pure ""what the hell?"" strangeness of Donnie Darko for example. However, A History Of Violence does bewildering in quite a different manner. Basically, whatever assumptions Cronenburg encourages you to make, whether they concern the plot or simply the style of the film you're watching, he then defies and dashes.From the first half hour or so, A History Of Violence seems as if it will turn out to be a commentary on the part violence plays in modern society, in the same way as racism is examined in Crash. We see the foiled armed-robbery at the coffee shop, the high school bullying, the father striking the son when he steps out of line. But then suddenly the storyline gathers such momentum that any concerns about deeper meaning fall away, leaving AHOV to be an out-and-out thriller.All this is mainly possible thanks to Viggo Mortensen, whose ability to transform from considerate family businessman to the taciturn Terminator through the course of the film appears effortless. Combined with Ed Harris's battle-scarred and scared-of-nothing villain threatening to ignite the heavy tension at any second, and the strength of Maria Bello to boot, any shortcomings from a slightly overstretched plot can be ignored.",A History of Violence
564,amid77,Here goes the Magic,7,27 November 2005,"Well, its not Cronenberg best film.Somehow, this movie lacking real nerve impact, something horrible that will reach its ugly hand, grab my guts and squeeze it. And correct me if i'm wrong, but this is exactly what Cronenberg used to do in most of his previous films.And now, the magic is gone.Sure, we exposed to some nasty sides of quiet and peaceful American life, but hey, I refuse only to ""see"" the movie, I want to participate in this experience too. I want to feel the edge of the knife, slowly cutting my nerves, or maybe to feel that bullet going through my head and blowing my brains out, I want to feel a punch and taste the blood, but all I get when watching this film, is to feel like a distant viewer, a voyeur that floating above the bubbling swamp without any ability to be swallowed. (Wow, what a metaphor! Sometimes I'm amazing even myself).There is no real influence on the viewer, 'A History of Violence' is just a movie! And one thing I can't accept from Cronenberg, is ""just a movie"". Anyway, this movie depicts a lot of interesting situations that very nice to watch and nice to think about, but don't try to analyze it too deep, let the associations run, but not too far. This movie is not so complicated and more simple then you think.And if you want to see some really disturbing violence, I recommend ""Funny Games"" by Michael Haneke and his other films.",A History of Violence
565,nicolajdavies,Did I miss something?,2,17 May 2006,"OK, before anyone blasts me, and they may, because people seem to have some strong feelings about this film, I just keep thinking to myself that I may have missed the point with this. Admittedly I didn't like Reservoir Dogs when I first saw it either (and I love it now), but I just can't see this one growing on me.I saw this after seeing the great score and the great reviews on this site, and I really expected something special (which I got a week later in V For Vendetta), and to my credit I even bought a second copy when the first corrupted. That's how keen I was to see it! So, the plot...A rather sickeningly lovey dovey couple with a fairy tale relationship get into a situation, by chance, and the husband's true self is revealed. OK, so what? He confronts his past, deals with it rather too neatly to believe, and goes home. End of story. Thing is, I could have watched that in 5 minutes and it wouldn't have been any less of an experience.The baddies at the start turn out to have a minuscule part (I was expecting them to be the real baddies, and it's a shame they weren't as they were scarier), and the whole first few minutes following them seems pointless once you realise it was a bit part - I mean, why was it necessary to see what they'd done before they walked into the cafe. I think the hold up there made it pretty clear that they weren't nice people.Anyway, to continue: no innocent people die or get hurt, the bit part baddies are dealt with quite simply, the wife and daughter weren't even threatened, the real baddies aren't particularly violent, threatening or scary (in fact the one without the eye looked as though he should have been pensioned off when his eye was), the husband didn't even get injured, the police didn't come after him after the episode with his brother (speaking of which, why did the brother even need to kill him? it's made very clear he'd disappeared so completely that the bro could have just pretended he was dead, surely), the whole family was fine and dandy, the son's bullying problem seemed unrealistic and totally unrelated to the plot, the wife took hubby back (even though she looked a bit sulky) so the marriage was fine...I mean, really, nothing happened, not even genuine character development. The setting was unspectacular, the characters forgettable and unbelievable, and I was just left thinking ""so what?"" I think I'd have cared more if he or the wife, or even a kid, had died. At least we'd have seen emotion a little more genuine.I guess the only parts I actually enjoyed were the bits with gratuitous violence (like the jaw in the diner). Just as well with that title. At least the name worked.",A History of Violence

The movie had scored some great reviews in the newspapers In the about 90 minutes the movie lasts, there is only two scenes where you feel fine, and that is the two semi-nude scenes. There's not really any story, a man gets haunted by his past and therefor he must kill some bad blokes. Although the story it self sucks, Viggo Mortensen does his best to make the movie worth watching. His facial expression always matches the given situation of the film. I don't know if it could earn him an Oscar-statue, but definitely a nomination for it. So if you're a fan of Aragorn, sorry... Viggo Mortensen it's a film you cant afford to miss.",A History of Violence
567,a-dobbs,A Very Silly Film,3,24 September 2005,"Just saw this. What a very silly film indeed. It simply doesn't work on any level whatsoever. As an exploration of the cycle of violence, it never rises above cliché: Stall ""We don't hit people to solve problems in this family"", Son: ""No we just shoot them instead"", Stall: ""Whack!"" Audience: ""Yawn"".But as straight out drama, it fails miserably too. One example here(there are plenty more): Stall shoots two men in his diner and he's a national hero. Later, he and his son kill three more on his front lawn and no more is said about it. No media interest, no police investigation, no comeback of any kind except by the gangsters who sent them in the first place. This kind of self contained surreality works in the world of a Blue Velvet, but it simply doesn't work here and Cronenberg really should have made up his mind as to what type of film he wanted to make.And the violence and sex scenes in themselves are cynical in the extreme. It's as if Croneberg is saying ""Hey, look at the bullet wounds, look at the blood, and the naked lady, this is a SERIOUS adult film for SERIOUS adults"". But I'm afraid it's not. If Cronenberg has any kind of underlying 'message' that he's trying to put across then I'm afraid its been left behind in the editing suite. This film has as much psychological depth as a puddle in summer and is a major step backwards from a director who has yet to produce anything worthy of his inclusion in the top flight.",A History of Violence

569,Lawyerdude1989,I enjoyed this movie!,6,7 November 2005,"I enjoyed this movie! There was a good emotional payoff throughout the movie. The bad guys were very well cast! The only bad casting was the lead/ husband, the wife, and the son. I hated those three. The little girl was cute. There is really no mystery as to whether Tom is Joey. There are several lines that give you this information, as if the story would be better otherwise. This is a well told story without flashbacks. The downside is that the story is so shallow. Also, the plot is very contrived. 1 No woman lawyer would marry a man without knowing his past. 2 This small town diner would not be that crowded. 3 If the gangsters wanted this guy they simply would have got him without the cat and mouse. This story could have been written by a 10th grader. This is not a great movie. It is not even as satisfying as a good episode of Law and Order. However, it was good enough to satisfy my taste for a movie. Now that I think of it, this was really a dumb movie!",A History of Violence
570,OrdinarySun,A History of Violence (2005)... Sometimes it's better to not look back.,8,3 April 2006,"It's good ole' fashioned film noir. What more do you want? The Story: A mans violent past catches up to him when he becomes a minor celebrity after killing two men in self defense. It's simple and straight forward and that's almost it's biggest downfall. The cinematography is good, the angles nice, and all, but it's not the stylish neo-noir thriller that I was led to believe it was. So, I guess to say the least, it could have looked better, but still looked nice. The story is something great, and has a few plot twists here and there, but it moves at a somewhat slow pace, it takes about twenty minutes for anything incredibly exciting to happen, and then it becomes repetitious, drama, violence, drama, violence. The action scenes were great and scarily realistic from the visuals right down to the audio, but the action was missing something, it didn't have the cinematic edge that you would expect. Some somewhat pointless sex here and there, but seeing as how it's based on a graphic novel, that's to be expected. It's a good film but it's better if you're not expecting the next Cape Fear. Plus, where's the great character development? It's lacking in that department, you get a general idea of his wife, and you get a little bit more detail on his son, but these characters could have been explored so much better... Also, beware, I'm not spoiling anything, but there seems to be a lot of people that don't like the ending. Personally I thought the ending fit the film rather well, but I get the feeling that I'm a minority in thinking that.The Cast: Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello, Ed Harris, William Hurt, Ashton Holmes... Viggo Mortensen is Tom Stall, a man just trying to live in peace with his family. His acting is top notch and performance stands out from the rest. You'll feel a good connection between him and you, not sure if you should love him or hate him. Chances are though you're not going to hate him. Maria Bello is Edie Stall, she's Tom's wife. As the film progresses you get a little bit of an idea of what kind of person she is, and who she is, but not enough to make you really feel a lot for her. Ashton Holmes is Jack Stall, the son. Again you don't get much information about him, but you get more about him than you do Edie. To perfectly honest, I thought his acting was terrible. Not good, he had a few moments, but a lot of the time I felt like he was just reciting empty words. Luckily you don't deal with him a lot. Ed Harris is Carl Fogarty, one of the main villains of the film. He'll give you a great unsettling feeling, but this for some reason doesn't stand out as one of his most powerful performances. Don't get me wrong, he's great and perfectly cast, it's just not his best role. William Hurt is Richie Cusack, the big villain, the mob boss. It's a good performance, but he's not quite as demanding or intimidating as one would expect. I can see why he was nominated for ""Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role"" but at the same time I can't help but think someone else should have had his spot in the nominations. He was just lacking something, he came off as kind of a clichéd villain. Hit or miss.One to Five Scale: 3 Maybe it's because I had my hopes up, or maybe it's because there was a lot going on when I watched it... A second viewing might change things, but upon first viewing this one was unfortunately a three. It's a great film if you know what to expect. If you sit down expecting the next Cape Fear you'll be sorely disappointed, but if you sit down looking for a drama with a side of intense violence than you'll be in for a great experience. This makes for a great rental and possible purchase... And I say that knowing what I'm talking about, as I went out and bought a copy... Seriously, rent first, buy later.Tyler uninspired_2002@hotmail.com http://spaces.msn.com/stoppedby7/",A History of Violence

Viggo Mortensen is remarkable as Mr. Stall on this ""mainstream"" movie, and it's a shame that he was not recognized by the Academy on the last awards show. Maria Bello also, excellent on her continuous strike of good movies. It's a pleasure to see William Hurt back in action, in a well deserved Supporting Actor nomination. A ""must see"" movie, definitely. It's a movie with no special effects, with no machinery and art visuals. The best part is the excellent cast, the great script, and a brilliant and quiet direction. Don't let that the title mislead you, it's not about gore or extreme ""man to man"" violence, it's about violence inside your head, how it affect us, and how you can handle it.

A well-to-do gentleman with a top hat and cane walks down a sidewalk, steps off the curb and lands face down in mud puddle. Hilarious. Comedy is all about set-up and perception, and so is violence.Throughout this film we are subject to a multitude of forceful acts, all of them violent, all of them causing physical and/or emotional harm to another person, and all of them under vastly different circumstances. There were moments when (at my viewing) audience members applauded and cheered when act of violence was committed, they were also audibly horrified by others, and even found humor in yet others. Which acts are justified? Which are excessive? Is violence something that is passed from generation to generation? Can violence be funny, or even sexy? David Cronenberg plays the audience with this film, he asks us these questions, and we must think of how we reacted to each scene and find out where we draw personal lines.Although the film is thought provoking, it indeed has it's flaws. There are points where the dialog is unintentionally laughable, and the film's family seems to be wearing their smiles just a touch wider than comfortable. But powerful performances from William Hurt and Viggo Mortensen tend to stick with us more than other distractions. See this film, think about it, and draw your own lines.-3 stars for some iffy acting, clichéd supporting characters, and improbable situations even within the world the film creates.",A History of Violence

However, I found absolutely nothing in A History of Violence to be remarkable or even interesting. I thought the poor writing, direction, and acting was purposeful in order to set up a payoff later. Nope. There is nothing worth waiting the running time for. The characters and their interactions lacked ""truth"" and as one violent/loving/sexual scene on a set of stairs was embarrassingly thrust on the audience, I thought one of the six in the theater would leave.

So, much more I could say about this, one of the best I've ever seen, movie, but that would involve spoiling the movie for others.If you love thought provoking movies that make you rethink life then please do yourself a favor and see this movie and then you will probably be like me and start checking out everything Cronenberg.",A History of Violence

It is a movie that stays with you, both for the acting and the storyline. Whose history of violence is it? Is it the horribly graphically disturbing killers at the beginning of the movie, who unsettle you at first sight? Is it the Mobsters who come after him, who have a long history of violent behavior, or is it Tom himself? The over-the-top portrayals are fitting, and after so much disturbing violence, a welcome reprieve. William Hurt is better than his normal monotone form, and Viggo Mortensen (sp?) is a study in transformation once the plot line is truly revealed. Maria Bello is a bit anorexic, but credible as the confused, yet supportive wife. Good Show, I'm glad it was free, but I would see it again with friends.

577,kayins,One of the Worst Movies of the Year,1,21 October 2005,"For the life of me I can't understand what people see in this film. I saw it at the Toronto Film Festival. The movie is plagued with bad acting, bad dialogue, miscasting, and a cliché plot. I've read comments that the movie is introspective. But I failed to see an introspective moment on screen.****SPOILERS***** The sex scene between Viggo and Maria on the stairs was realistic, but the sixty-nine sex scene, supposedly to show how into each other they were, didn't work. While it's a great position between partners, it looks ridiculous when trying to show intimacy. Especially when they acted like they were snacking on each other.Maria Bello- Cast as a small town attorney. Miscast maybe. Her look speaks to big city lawyer but not small town.Viggo- At least Maria tried to act. Viggo looked like someone was feeding him his lines from behind the camera. I really love his wooden acting when he tries to tell Maria that he thought he buried Joey a long time ago. It looked like he was going to laugh at one point. Plus it's hard to take a middle-aged man named ""Joey"" seriously.Direction-Viggo's limping scene as he tries to race home to save his family. Crazy. Viggo snapping a flunkie's neck on his way out of his criminal brother's office. HI-larious. Or even the choice to have all the mob guys wear black like a vampire convention.I could maybe forgive those scenes (or not) but I couldn't stand the obvious metaphor with the weak bully who preyed on Viggo's son. The bully was really a wimp at heart and Viggo's son was just waiting for his burst of motivation to take on the bully and his flunkie in the spirit of his father's heroism. Haven't seen that before.But the worst was, no not Ed Harris hamming it up as Mr. Fogarty, but Viggo's daughter. She had to be one of the most grating child actors ever cast. She was horrible.In summary, from the moment Viggo's family crowded around the little girl because she had a nightmare and all were there to console her (in Cronenberg's hackneyed attempt to show Tom Stall's initially perfect existence) to the end when Tom/Joey/Michael Myers comes home to find his family tensely sitting at the dinner table and little girl Sarah pulls out a plate to show daddy Tom/Joey/Jason X is still part of the family, the movie was a complete package of one terribly directed cliché after another.",A History of Violence

It's the kind of movie that sticks in your head for the longest time and really makes you think (in a good way). For some reason, I cannot shake this film out of my brain.I am not going to attempt any explanations, this is the kind of film you need to see for yourself and think out for yourself. I am mostly writing this to say that you should not miss this one. The relevance of this movie to the world we live in cannot be overstated. If I make it sound too cerebral, be assured, the movie is also entertaining. Plus the cinematography is beautiful.It seems some people have problems with the quite explicit sexual scenes or with the level of violence, but I have to disagree. The violence shown is never gratuitous. Equally with the sex. It is necessary to the story, both as a counterpoint to the violence and to show how the characters are affected by what is happening.I am not saying this is the best movie ever made. There are moments when the pacing is a bit on the slow side. My main gripe is that the child actress chosen to play the daughter does not look right at all for a family which is supposed to be so ordinary and this actually took me out of the movie. (Somebody spends way too much on haircare products for a child this young.)

Mortensen and Harris are capable of so much more. The opening scene is oddly filmed, contains a disturbing element, and adds little, except as a set-up for the main plot point. Without much character development, this point could have been made quicker and easier, allowing for more backstory with Mortensen's and Harris' characters.From beginning to end, the movie is nothing but a vehicle for raunchy sex scenes and graphic violence. (This is one ""R"" movie which you should spare the kiddos.) I wouldn't mind those elements if they added something to the plot, but they don't. The suspense falls flat, leaving the viewer waiting for an interesting twist or satisfying conclusion which never happens. I, for one, was very disappointed.

584,b-doyle,Pretentious and nonsensical,5,9 January 2006,"Having sat down to watch 'A History...' with relatively high expectations, I came out of it very, very disappointed. Whilst there are some excellent performances (particularly Mortensen and Ed Harris), the whole film reeks of a victory for style over substance, the plot is thin to nonexistent, and the character's reactions to certain situations are implausible at best, and downright ridiculous at worst (see Mortensen's sex scene - with his deceived wife). Viggo Mortensen plays the mild mannered protagonist whose past comes back to haunt him, in the form of aging mobster Ed Harris. The result is a confusing bundle of violence and gunplay...the culmination of which leaves the audience feeling that they have missed something. Whilst the acting is often excellent, the film does not seem to go anywhere...and Cronenburg's self-consciously arty style begins to grate after a while.",A History of Violence
585,TheZapRowsdower,"...this isn't great on an objective level, but it is definitely good",6,3 October 2005,"It's that time of year again. Studios are releasing movies they believe are worthy of being voted best picture. That's right, forget about Cinderella Man (a film that should have been released around this time but was instead lost in the summer shuffle), because these are the movies the Academy is going to be looking at. Keep an eye out for Brokeback Mountain, Memoirs of a Geisha, and A History of Violence -- these seem to be the major players this year. But enough about what the critics and analysts say. What do I think?Personally, I found the movie to be very overrated. Notice, I didn't say it was a bad movie. Because it wasn't. What we're looking at is a really good story with really good acting, but a poorly written screenplay.So much of a film's quality depends on the screenwriter's ability to write believable, realistic dialog, which is an ability Josh Olson did not have. Before he began writing the script, he should have spent some time in high school, listening to how some of the students talked. I found any scene involving Tom Stall's son laughable and downright insulting (I graduated high school two years ago, high school is NOT like that). Most of the screenplay just seemed like a run-down vehicle to drive the fantastic story around in.Still, what director David Cronenberg managed to build on that weak foundation was no mean feat. Silence of the Lambs this movie ain't, but damned if Cronenberg isn't good at using subtlety. Viggo Mortensen, Maria Bello and Ed Harris are surely Oscar contenders (although I seriously doubt any one of them will win), and I gotta give William Hurt some credit for actually having a personality in this movie, as opposed to his usual monotonous performances. Ashton Holmes, however, was a terrible casting choice. If a character's scenes are poorly written, the least they could do is cast someone who can deliver it they way it was intended to be delivered.The story was intriguing, too. It was a very good psychological study... I can't really go too far into that without spoiling the movie, so I'll have to ask you to take my word for it. But if you can get past the lackluster screenplay (and we all loved Revenge of the Sith - that shouldn't be a problem) and pay attention to the story, you'll see that it is actually a work of genius.I'll be reading the graphic novel as soon as I can get a hold of a copy.I've learned to watch films from several perspectives, and I gotta say this isn't great on an objective level, but it is definitely good. Mortensen, Bello and Harris will definitely get the Academy's attention, and Cronenberg fans will love it. Still, I can assure you this isn't the best Oscar season has to offer, and I will not be surprised (or even disappointed, really) if this film gets lost in the shuffle.It does, however, earn my seal of approval.Premise: 10/10Acting: 7/10Screenplay: 4/10Direction: 10/10Oscar predictions:Nominations - Best Actor in a Leading Role (Viggo Mortensen), Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Ed Harris), Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Maria Bello), Best Director (David Cronenberg)No wins.77.5% (C+)",A History of Violence

It is not about violence, or gangsters, or the Midwest.This is not a film.This is a window into the lives of real people. The fact that they are characters played by actors merely reinforces how well they are portrayed. The dialogue isn't Movie Dialogue--it is simply how people talk, and how often they don't talk. The long stretches of silence, of thinking, of anger feel like they do in real life: not perfect, not smooth, not epic. Just ordinary.This Has Almost Never Been Done Before.The Last Picture Show, The Grapes of Wrath, Trois Colours, The Dead Poets Society...any others? A few, maybe. Never as strikingly as this. This is the rebirth of Cinema Verite, film as voyeuristic look into the lives of people who happen to be interesting. Love has never looked so.../involved/. Psychology has never looked so boring or unimportant. Gym class never looked so real.The scary part is...if this Happened to These Folks, it Could Happen to You.Eek.Cronenberg added the mind to his New Flesh in Scanners and the Dead Zone, but giving the New Mind power is one thing; shattering it into scared, broken pieces is another. This began with Spider, twisty and turny and incomprehensible, but was thrown into sharp relief in small-town Indiana.

Mortenson proves he's more than a one note actor in this wonderfully jarring and edgy film. The crowd I saw it with didn't appreciate its subtler qualities or its willingness to portray complex, adult sexual themes (unlike those found in American Pie-style movies). If you are looking for something with a little edge and intelligence in the year of The Dukes of Hazard and The Longest Yard this is your ticket. Be forewarned, however, it is one of (if not the) most violent films this year. This may seem obvious given the title but I must warn you this is not Hidalgo.

I haven't seen one for a long time that gets good, and sometimes great reviews (A local critic gave it 4 stars!)like this movie, and it turned out to be so horrible, like this one was. Ed Harris it great in it, but even he can't come close to saving it. The sex scenes were odd, and Mario Bello's man hands are creepy to say the least. If you haven't seen it, look at her hands in the first sex scene in the dark..wow! I thought ""Well, at least she isn't nude in this epic"",and there she comes in an open robe, and folks, she never has been, and sure isn't now, attractive in the slightest way. I know some guys think she's hot, but I don't get it at all.For every 10 seconds of action, there's about 20 minutes of looking at each other, teary eyed most of the time. There are high points, the action is done well, and the kid getting revenge on the jock was something I could relate to, having been harassed by a similar clown in high school. I got my revenge on him psychologically, years later, but the way it was done in the movie was pretty satisfying, and showed a ""Like father, like son"" theme, mess with them long enough, and they stomp you like a bug.The ending was a joke. Some posters said people laughed at then end and during the movie, but when I went it was like a crypt until the end, when all *7* if us in the theatre (Yes, I counted) either chuckled or snorted as the credits came up.Since it didn't have any really big stars in it, the studio wont lose much on it. The director has done much better movies in the past, so one dud won't hurt too much. I have to wonder about people who think this is a good movie, I really do.",A History of Violence
592,klineholly,"A brilliant, smart film",10,22 October 2005,"This film is excellent and is a refreshing break from the drivel that Hollywood has been offering lately. A History of Violence reminded me of a Quentin Tarantino film, only smarter. (I don't mean to slam Tarantino films; I think they're great but History of Violence was just a little more intellectually stimulating).At any rate, Viggo Mortensen is absolutely amazing-his performance is definitely Oscar-worthy. William Hurt is very good too--he plays his character with just the right amount of brutality and humor. Ed Harris was pretty good, but his character doesn't shine like some of the others.I only have one tiny negative thing to say about the film. I won't spoil anything but there is one scene between Mortensen and his character's wife that seemed just gratuitous--it wasn't believable and didn't add anything to the movie.Other than that, this movie is a must-see.

I strongly recommend you see it. Be informed that it is a film of a graphic novel and judge it that way. Viggo Mortensen (Tom Stall) is terrific. Maria Bello (Edie Stall) matches him as a woman who would hold a man such as Tom Stall's interest and desire.

Maria Bello's character, for example, seems to exist merely to provide the love scenes, which I also found to be unnecessarily graphic and to cheapen the movie. The characters of the bad guys (excluding our protagonist) are even thinner. They continually pop up as silly comic book villains to give Tom (Mortensen) someone to kill. The son Jack (Holmes) at least constitutes a part of the story and also has a background of himself.The only good aspect of this movie, which actually makes it worth seeing, is the depiction of the violence.

When he defends himself and his beloved ones he takes out his true nature, and it reveals the true nature of his family.

The movie started out just fine with a good opening scene and was even going fine but was totally ruined by the time we reached the middle. There wasn't a main struggle in the film and Mortensen's acting was bland at best. The struggle between the son and the bully was totally unrealistic and completely lame. The characters weren't natural and everything just seemed so scripted. I know it's a movie but there has to be a hint of realisticness that this movie just didn't have.Above it all, though, the main thing that got me was the anti-climatic events between Fogarty and Tom. They were building it slowly and it seemed to be going fine but out of nowhere they just kill off what was looking to be the main antagonist? And the whole scene with the brother, was there a point? They didn't build up a struggle and he just goes back to kill him? Why? All in all, it was poorly written and the acting was terrible.",A History of Violence
599,behavedave66,If only they looked out for their own,8,30 January 2007,"A number of the scenes in A History of Violence discuss a concept of looking out for one's own.Firstly Jake, the son, is threatened in the locker room after making the vital catch to win the baseball game. Jake is completely submissive in order to avoid a fight with the school bully, whose nose has been put out of joint by this. Surely at this point, Jake's team mates should have been at his shoulder defending their match-winning hero from an aggressive bad loser? The theme continues with the local Police Officer, Sam, who repeatedly assures Tom that ""we look after our own here""- a sentiment that maybe he has never been used to in the past- but one which his son Jake clearly understands.When Fogarty arrives at Tom's house, Tom tells his wife and son to go inside; ""I'll take them"" he claims. The result is that despite seeing off one hired thug, he is left on the floor at the mercy of an armed Fogarty. It is only the actions of his son, who has ignored his father's please to leave him and instead picks up a shotgun and shoots Fogarty, which saves Tom's life.As the film unwinds we learnt the family secret that is behind Tom's shady past. In his former life as Joey, Tom had a violent past and terrible track record, which had reflected badly on Joey's brother Richie (in gangland mob boss terms) and prevented him from being given as much power and success as he wanted. At this point, surely (given my understanding of gansters' traditional sense of family, taken from Godfather, The Krays and Eastenders...) Richie should have stood side by side with his brother and ""looked out for his own"". But again, he didn't and instead tried to have him killed. Disgusting.The final scene when Tom returns home to a family dinner reinforces this idea of close knit family security. So ultimately, family comes first and don't stand by while your mates get bullied.",A History of Violence
600,GaryIndianna,We Look After Our Nice People,8,8 February 2007,"During the promotion of 'History Of Violence', David Cronenberg was asked if he cast Viggo Mortensen because of Mortensen's innate sense of goodness, with which audiences might be familiar from 'Lord of the Rings'. No, replied Cronenberg, he cast Mortensen because he's strange. And if you look at Mortensen's other films, it's true. In Lord of the Rings, his hair was darkened, and he was bearded, so it wasn't so readily apparent. But there's something odd about him. It can be seen in 'A Perfect Murder', 'Hidalgo', 'Daylight'. Even in 'GI Jane', bulked up and with a moustache, there's something not quite right. Which is why he's perfectly cast as Tom in this film.Tom lives what might be seen as the essential American life. He has a loving wife, and two great kids - a teenage son and a younger daughter. He owns the town diner, and we're allowed to eavesdrop on the banalities of his everyday life. 'See you in church tomorrow', beams one of Tom's customers. But when two deeply unpleasant criminals stop at Tom's diner, everything changes. Tom turns the tables on these two invaders in dramatic fashion, and suddenly finds himself the main headline on every news programme on every TV channel. And he reacts in exactly the way we would expect him to, modestly shrugging his shoulders and mumbling that anyone in his position would have done the same thing.But there's a reason for Tom's modesty. Soon, gangsters come to the diner. They think that Tom is someone else, someone who crossed them years before, and who they've been hoping will show up again. Is Tom really Tom? Is he in a witness protection programme? Or is he actually someone else? Cronenberg is going back twenty years in this film, back to the ambiance of 'The Dead Zone'. In that film, Christopher Walken played a normal guy with a devastating secret, although with quite different consequences. The two films share the same muted mis-en-scene, the same autumnal quality of austerity. But whereas Christopher Walken's Johnny Smith was allowed to remain himself, Tom is not. Tom himself is the serpent in this bucolic eden.Despite the sometimes sensational scenes, everything about History of Violence seems subdued, understated. There's a great moment where the town's sheriff, Sam, pulls over the car containing gangster Ed Harris and his bodyguards. Sam doesn't realise the danger he's in, and tries his best to appear menacing. Harris is so unperturbed, he barely looks up from his newspaper. After Sam's big speech, Harris, asked if he gets the picture, merely shrugs 'Yeah, sure', and carries on reading. When later on, Harris tells Tom's wife of his (Tom's) true identity, he hisses, 'You know it's true'. And at that moment, so do we. There's also a finely judged performance by Ashton Holmes as Tom's son, Jack. He's a victim of bullying at school, and his transformation from turn-the-other-cheek nerd to locker room pugilist mirrors his father's transformation. As he realises the truth about Tom, Jack confronts him: 'Dad, if I knock over the drug store and refuse to give you a piece of the action, will you ground me?'.At the end of the film, Tom realises he must face his past as a violent criminal so he goes home to confront his brother, a gangster himself. His brother, however, is glad to see him only because it will allow him to kill Tom. William Hurt plays Tom's brother, in a one scene performance that defies proper description. He talks like Emo Phillips, the comedian, and has a ridiculous beard that would be better suited to Blofeld in a Bond film. Tom turns the tables one last time, and lives to return home, where he is, it seems, accepted. Maybe it's better to have a father you don't really know, rather no father at all.",A History of Violence
601,jrireland,There's no way this deserves one star,9,25 August 2007,"I don't care whether or not you enjoyed this movie, giving it one star is a joke. Some people called it ""The worst movie of the year."" These people must watch and incredibly small number of movies or have very selective memories because 2005 had the following films: Doom, Domino, Get Rich or Die Trying', Deuce Bigallo 2, Elektra and Aeon Flux. You have to be a moron to believe that A History of Violence sinks to the level of that garbage. Moreover, some of the problems people have with the movie are ridiculous. There were basically 3 types of people who didn't like this movie: People who thought it was too violent, people who were expecting an action movie, and people who were upset by the acting and script. If you thought it was too violent, you're missing the point. When the son beats the bully to a bloody pulp the violence is not gratuitous, it serves a very real purpose. This just proves my belief that realistic and intelligent violence somehow offends people more than the cartoon-like violence that glorifies violent people that is found in some films. The people who were expecting and action movie and didn't get one really confuse me. Basically they're saying that they went into the movie expecting a stupid Hollywood action movie and were upset that they got an intelligent and psychological film. Basically the movie was too intelligent for them. People who were upset by the acting and script are more understandable. I thought it was well done but it's okay if you disagree. Even so, this acting and script problem could not possibly warrant the one star rating some have given it. One thing I thought was really twisted was when people attacked the little girls acting ability. This is a little bit of a digression, but if a primary fault of a movie is the acting ability of a 7 year old the movie can't be that bad. Also, calling her acting ability ""horrendous"" as some people have is a very mean thing to say about such a young actress. Overall I thought the movie was very well done and the violence did serve a definite purpose.",A History of Violence

Based on what I had seen prior to this, I had found his films wholly unengaging, with little or no emotional or intellectual depth. His direction is habitually pedestrian, touched by stylized visuals that do nothing other than call attention to themselves.That said, I finally figured I had to see this film, albeit three years too late, spurred on by the comments of people whose opinions I generally respect.Sorry to say, though, that A History of Violence only confirmed my long-held view of Cronenberg: That he is a cold film maker with little or no understanding of human emotions and how to portray them cinematically.This film is flat, unengaging, clichéd and inept. The characters are uninteresting (even the villains), the dialog trite, the acting uninspired and the direction even more so. This sort of story has been done much better by many others before.

It isn't working. The 'graphic' parts taken from this graphic novel are edgy and promising; but,the rest of the film has no such texture.This is the most poorly edited film I have seen in years. There are so many unnecessary scenes--scenes that are neither foreshadowing, nor important to character development. (And many of them are needlessly long and painful.) Plus, the end makes you just want to scream. Not only is it wholly unsatisfying, it leaves you with nothing but questions about the future of these characters.This film has none of the redemptive features that you would expect from its title--which, in itself, already gives too much away.

The idea of a history of violence being suppressed and hidden and then recognized by someone who was harmed by you has the beginnings of a great plot. So my expectations of suspense were very high and in the beginning it seemed this movie might live up to its billing, but as the movie goes on it was predictable. The main character doesn't seem all that worried that a big mob boss has discovered his low key lifestyle. The one scene when he panics and believes they are going after his family is not believable and doesn't follow through.

The violence , crime , emotions and love-making all at its extreme to say the least. Although at certain point of time it seems that the scenes of Gore had been unnecessarily put too many times into it. The director David Cronenberg, in order to put a clear picture of the prowess our protagonist had with guns and fighting techniques was visible since the very first scene at the restaurant. No need to prove it again and again with a new set of villains. This was never supposed to be an action flick.But on the other hand looking from a positive perspective, the word ""History"" by showing only the present wouldn't have been highlighted or revisited if it wasn't for these scenes.Viggo Mortensen, our Aragorn (and forever will be, I'm afraid) has yet again proved his mettle with the kind of emotions portrayed through this character. A soft gentle father with a killer secret hidden deep within his heart to a protecting selfless one ready to forsake his future to save the family.I actually saw this movie after watching his ""The Road"" which I thought was not made for his stature. He sets yet another milestone, a shining achievement, giving us yet another role to remember him for.

606,WDD,One of Cronenberg's Best,9,27 September 2005,"POTENTIAL SPOILERS: I'll admit it, I'm a sucker for two things -David Cronenberg movies and story lines that revolve around the idea that all is not what it appears to be... Since A History of Violence makes good on these, it's a definite recommend. Cronenberg's direction is as such that when the moments of violence do occur, they're all the more effective for it. There is no excessive slow motion and hyper stylized camera and sound work (think Washowski's, Tarantino, Rodriquez, etc) but instead a documentary-like commitment to presenting the event as immediate and honest as possible. As a result, I found myself ingesting these moments for quite sometime after the film. His direction is so self assured that it's actually refreshing. I am sick and tired of violence being portrayed as pop video in modern cinema. All of those exhausting camera angles and obnoxious music in lesser films serve to insult and patronize me... The opening sequence of this film alone stands as an antidote to all of the aforementioned offenders. In terms of the performances, particular mention must go to Maria Bello. I could really feel her pride, lust, balls out fear, sickening sense of dread fused with an attraction and self-loathing once she learns she may have married a murderer.... Hers was a pitch perfect performance and I'd like to see her nominated for this. I was sincerely moved by this character. And of course, there is Viggo -although I am sure a lot of people will be writing about his performance most of all, I will say this,whether he is chastising his son about the rejection of violence as a way of dealing with matters (only to then strike him) or casually picking up empty soda cans and smiling at strangers before aggressively detaching two evil men from their time on earth -there is always a duality threatening to burst.... Viggo is walking a line here and it's a pleasure for me, as a cinemagoer, to watch that tension display itself on the screen. And, during one of many climactic moments, when Viggo utters the line ""I should've killed you back in Philly"" to Ed Harris, he's confirming something we'd already grown to suspect, he is both a midwestern family man and a cold blooded killer. It's a brilliant moment and a shining confirmation of why I still go to the cinema.",A History of Violence
607,jenwrks,Violence in the title but not the film,4,2 October 2005,"After seeing the previews and reading about this film (before any reviews came out to sway my opinion) I went to see it and was actually pretty excited about it. I think Viggo is a decent actor and I love Maria Bello (the bar owner from Coyote Ugly). HOWEVER. This movie, entitled A History of Violence, didn't actually have any. Sure, there were a few scenes with death, but it mostly consisted of people getting shot in the head. The best part was when Viggo killed those guys in the diner, and that was in the preview. Maybe I missed that it was all about the struggle of someone who has been lying to his family for 15+ years (judging by the age of his son). Maybe I don't get the deep conflict he had with himself. Maybe I don't care. I wanted to see a good movie about violence, and I was instead given a film with virtually no musical score that talked about how violence is bad as a consolation prize.

The first act of the film seems to be setting up some complex and fascinating questions about our relationship to violence and the nature of identity. But these themes are then largely abandoned, as the film becomes an extremely well-crafted and entertaining, but not particularly thought-provoking, gangsters and guns thriller. William Hurt I would go so far as to say was delightful, and I've honestly never liked him in anything before. Ed Harris is outstanding too. Garish product placement though: a certain box of Honey Bunches of Oats appears so often that it really should have been given some lines.

With Cronenberg, this is no exception. Within the first viewing of the trailer I said, ""God, this looks amazing! I have to find out who this guy is."" So I rented Spider, it was a highly underrated film. Scanners was unique and had that ""depraved"" style of a Toronto filmmaker stamped all over it. Then I watched the Criterion of Naked Lunch and was again amazed. Fans of Fear and Loathing should watch this similarly author driven insane/schizoid tale.So we can analyze a filmmaker based on his evolution or pattern of adaptation in making films. You can observe where the director sees a miss and a hit and exploits or shies away from his or her fears. Cronenberg a genius in my opinion, uses all his knowledge and sensibilities to create a near masterpiece of genre switching satire and utilizes this ensemble cast as an excruciatingly precise palette to create vivid and emotion imagery and movement.Viggo Mortensen has always been scantly used for leading man roles until the great LOTR trilogies. He does justice a complex and subtle alter ego pining a hidden rage and past for blood lust. Ed Harris reminded me of his strong character induced portrayal in Glengarry Glenross.The action scenes are all the rave, and no one's complaining about the intense graphed of that compared to the sex. Everything in this film comes fluid, whether the camera work or the surprises. The cues are thoughtful and purposed, and every scene captivates awe or anxiety. If you've seen Cronenberg's other works you'll enjoy and respect the intellect of this one.",A History of Violence
610,biggusdickus76,Totally disjointed & pointless,2,31 March 2006,"This movie follows a disturbing trend in Hollywood these days...it mistakes obliqueness with profundity. Nothing about this movie fit -- the plot was non existent & the characters were flimsy (with the exception of Mortensen's). William Hurt is embarrassingly bad here. There's really nothing nice to say about this movie. The most insulting part was what the director tried to do (without spoiling) I'll just say he took a fractured series of events, some under-developed characters, and tried to impose some profound statement on the viewer, again mistaking obliqueness with profundity. People who rate this movie high are overlooking the fact that the characters in this film & their actions are not only unrealistic, but don't even follow their own rationales.The sex & violence didn't bother me. This movie was awful for other reasons. Mortensen was good, though.",A History of Violence
611,AnneOBrienRice,Brilliantly about violence without glorifying violence,10,8 February 2008,"No, not for children, but mesmerizing and brilliant, exposing violence in all its hideousness; never glorifying it, even for a moment. Viggo Mortensen is turning out to be one of the most remarkable actors of our time, right up there with Johnny Depp and Gary Oldman. The subtle changes he achieves in his performance are so incredible that you really have to see the film more than once to get the full range. Everybody's excellent. Cronenberg, as always, is superb in his direction, delivering something utterly surprising moment to moment, and consistently thrilling artistically in spite of the most jarring shocks. Highly recommended to those who have a special fascination for the way violence is handled in film or any art form, which means that the title is right on. The pace is perfect. I rank it with the HBO series Deadwood for being a trip into Hell in which we see souls wrestling with absolutes and determined to achieve moral triumphs, in spite of overwhelming odds. I want to see the film a third time to better understand the relationship of the high school sequence to the major theme of the film.",A History of Violence
612,scratch1419,Top notch Cronenberg,10,8 November 2005,"I saw this film tonight - a brilliant interpretation of the graphic novel. Cronenberg is definitely one of the finest film-makers around. His cast is superb, particularly the leads. William Hurt delivers an Oscar-worthy performance, as does the always-great Ed Harris. Viggo and Maria prove, once again, why they are so highly regarded in the film industry, and deservedly so. The photography and editing are both brilliantly done, as is the case always with a Cronenberg production. The ending was extremely moving and effective - no talking, just a family hopefully getting back together. Ashton Holmes also deserves some recognition for his touching portrayal of the son - a major discovery. All in all - a terrific night at the movies. Yet another terrific Canadian movie! Bravo to Cronenberg and all involved in this film. Bring on the Genies!!",A History of Violence

I was made 10 years ago, and I can see why I never heard about it. Without a doubt, this is the worst movie of all time. I don't feel too bad saying that. So many of the actors in it have gone a long way in their careers, and I'm glad this is now in a distant past for them. However, I'm disappointed in a few of them. Viggo was in Lord of the Rings. How an actor can move on to this after being Aragorn... especially considering he was part of 3 colossal hits. I suppose what is the most unforgivable was the directing and editing after showing some really awful 'beginner-like' parts in a movie that should have been cut. There were also an unbelievable amount of poor sentences being spoken by actors that should have walked off the set after saying them To say I am disappointed is an understatement",A History of Violence
614,kristin_pettit,Awkward,3,8 October 2005,"I have been reading other comments about this movie that describe it as ""stunning"".. ""striking"".. ""brilliant"", even..The only thing stunning about this movie is how incredibly bad it is. I normally trust IMDb's ratings. How this movie managed an 8.1 I'll never know. It certainly isn't due to the direction, acting, music, or script.I won't waste my time on the plot. Everyone knows what it is about. The important thing to know here is why you SHOULDN'T go see it. Reason number one, the sex scenes.. The first sex scene can only be described as ""awkward"".I have never watched anything in my life where I felt so bad for the people acting out a scene as I did in the first sex scene (which occurs in the daughters bedroom while the wife dresses up in her daughter's cheerleading uniform.. tell me there isn't something wrong with that?!). I think at one point he actually says ""woowee"" or ""oh boy"" or something like that. But the part where she is standing in the doorway hiking up her skirt is not remotely seductive, sexy, cute.. it is painful. Painful, unnecessary, off-topic, and intensely awkward.From then on, the movie is full of silence, grimacing expressions, and scenes that made you lose all respect for the director (or desires to see their future movies). The movie has great actors, but if it was your first time to see any one of them in a movie, you'd think they were no-names.. the acting is literally that bad.Or how about the part in the hospital when he tells her about Joey?? There was nothing strange about that.. and the ending! They couldn't even give you a decent ending or some sort of closure. Your left with a ""what the.."" thought.. not so much because it is a thought provoking film, but because there is no closure. You sit through a painful ten minute silent dinner to find out that nothing happens.This movie is literally one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Given the potential that it had in script and in casting, I can't imagine giving this more than a 3, and that is a stretch. I can only say that this movie was incredibly awkward, tasteless, and very difficult to watch. Do yourself a favor.. see another movie.. ANY other movie.",A History of Violence
615,hungwellac,"Bad, just plain bad.",3,7 October 2005,"If you have not seen this movie, don't.I am a big Vigo fan and after seeing the trailers for this movie was quite excited about seeing it. I was extremely disappointed. I will say that Vigo's performance was above average and Ed Harris was fairly spooky and interesting. There is so little else I can find to say good about this film.In my opinion the graphicness of the sex and violence in this film was designed to probe the psychology of violence and the relationship between these two primal urges. It fails to do this.The movie is frailty disjointed. The first scenes are quite hollow to me and just don't tie into much. I know this was supposed to show us more of the nature of, as Kubrick may have said, Ultraviolence, but their role in the film could have easily been replaced by a couple of goons wearing stockings on their heads.The best part of this film is the end credits. If you insist on wasting money, I can set up a paypal account and you can send me 10 bucks and I will send you an email with a couple of pictures from rotten.com and some heavy R rated photos.

I am a hardcore movie-watcher,& I am almost POSITIVE that this movie was good on the big screen,but I watched it on DVD on my computer, & all I saw was mindless violence. All Viggo does is kill kill kill.This was, I am sorry, worse then some low-budget slasher movie. This had no good story, I didn't feel attached to any character except the son,Jack,for whom I was thinking there SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE!!!! This movie can be summarized in three words BANG BANG BANG!(two for the shooting,one for the pointless sex scenes). There was nothing good about this movie. I cannot see how anyone could even enjoy this. NOW I Am going to really say something shocking: I watched ""Saw"" yesterday, & it was a BRILLIANT movie,not because of the violence,or the gore,but because it had twists & turns & it was SMART! This was just.....it doesn't glorify violence,but it doesn't make it a better reason to put it there. It's not the graphic nature of the violence that bothers me....it's the mindlessness of it. Now i know what you are all thinking: ""this Nimrod is crazy! He says that SAW is smart when it has about as much mindless violence as this great movie!!!"" Well yes,I am sorry to say,that it does! but I got into the story of SAW & i wanna see SAW 2.

617,nemorrino,Can I have my money back!,1,1 November 2005,"That was my first reaction after I saw this movie. Maybe I expected more from the director and the cast, maybe I was in the wrong mood, but the final result was disappointment. Granted, Ed Harris, Vigo and the rest of the main characters are excellently portrayed, however the supporting cast is as terrible as it can be. The acting of the school kids is so bad I suspect it's purposefully so. However if this is the case it's ""too advanced for me"". The story is good, but with a lot of ""holes"". In addition the movie is full with clichés and every step is absolutely predictable. If you have seen enough good movies you can tell pretty much what will be the next screen-shot and result from the very beginning of the movie. I've heard some good reviews about this movie and usually I have an open mind, however in this case I couldn't find the art quality some rave about. I would not recommend spending 10 bucks to see it. I wouldn't even recommend spending $4 to rent it. If you have Netflix or something like that - go ahead and watch it, but otherwise do not expect much.",A History of Violence

That made the movie a waste of time for me as it felt incomplete. Like I was eating a great undercooked gourmet meal. I guess this is what was supposed to make it ""artful"" and good. I like a movie that has a great beginning (which it did), interesting characters (which it did) and a great plot (which it was appearing to have, and a conclusion preferably great; but, at least having one (which it didn't.) I left the theater shaking my head in disbelief that it was praised so highly. I agree that the characters were interesting and the plot was absorbing and then all of a sudden, the movie was over - Like the last 30 minutes of the movie was just whacked off.I felt kind of tricked or duped that I went to see this movie.When will I ever learn. When a movie is ""critically acclaimed"", it's going to suck as a good movie experience.

619,Dman61,This movie is far from what it is trying to be - may contain spoilers,4,23 March 2006,"I liked Viggo Mortensen in LotR and in Perfect Murder and this movie synopsis promised something similar in terms of his acting range. Unfortunately, I was in for a disappointment. This movie apparently has the pretense of being deeply psychological which it never fulfills. This time, his metamorphosis did not convince me at all. It felt almost like all the time while being Tom he made an extra effort to look sheepish, which looked like bad acting in itself, just I am not sure whether it was Tom or Viggo or the director we should blame for that.Holes in the plot made me shake my head in disdain. Like the way Tom/Joey kills ""all"" the bad guys, three or four people at a time, and keep in mind those are not just your average guys but people who kill for living. Well, how do we make that fly? Easy. Let's make the bad guys turn away at the most climactic moment of the brawl. Problem solved... (Not really...) I realize I may sound as an action movie buff who cares only about body count. Well, I am not. I wish I could see a real portrayal of feelings, choices, etc. What I saw was... how should I say... pathetic? Unfinished story lines, including the main one, also look to me as a script flaw and not as a means of artistic expression. Are we to believe that after Tom returns home his main problem is whether his family accepts him or not? Yeah, right. He needs to think what to do tomorrow when people from Philly will be back 'cause this time they won't mess around. On a smaller scale, his son's standoff at school also seems to be resolved, right? I don't think so. All this makes movie very schematic, and I am surprised some see it as logical, consistent, and even touching. Oh well. A couple more things. The little girl is outright creepy, she scared me much more than Fogerty himself - she has a face of a grown up woman and the fact that her lines are not typical of a six year old doesn't help, either. And last but not least, I don't think the amount of sex scenes is justified, not to mention that none of them I found erotic. For instance, the moment when Maria Bello gives viewers some frontal nudity is completely uncalled for and looks cheesy. (That is, of course, just an opinion.) Once again, it looks like the director realized the movie isn't exactly Oscar material and tried to save it by throwing some steamy stuff in.

Sure, the story was solid and the acting was brilliant but it just wasn't as good as many people had been making out. To anyone who has seen 'Open Range', the similarities should be as clear as day. Not only are the stories of a similar vain, but the filming style is very similar i.e. blunt in its approach to violence.

The characters where all believable and the violence was well....violent! :) I particularly liked the way Viggo Mortensen portrayed his character, he was calm and placid until his alter ego came out and then it was all go.

As portrayed in this film, small town America takes multiple killings in stride, albeit after one day of excitement. A lonely sheriff is the total display of law enforcement and it seems he never heard of fingerprints to positively establish questionable identity. I suppose we are to assume that the big city police are no more proficient. Doesn't anybody in law enforcement read a newspaper or watch the news? The blame must be laid with the director and scriptwriter. The leads are all excellent actors who are trying their best with inferior material. Stylized violence would have been preferable to the manner it is displayed in this film.

There were some good moments and a lot of interesting questions raised but no real answers forthcoming. Instead we are shown (and this was skillful) the abhorrent nature of violence when it comes home in the first half of the film, only to have it flip over into the cartoonish realm for the second half so people can leave comfortably laughing?

One day, some of his former henchman roll into town to try and ""talk"" some sense into our former thug. Push comes to shove and shove, well, lets just say the talk does not go over very well for the big city thugs. Viggo Morteson is our confused protagonist and Ed Harris is our main bad guy. Thin script, thinner acting, over the top stunts for a so-called retired wiseguy, and terrible dialogue....Honestly, the most redeeming part of this movie is the sometimes quite gory special effects. i love the part when he is just starting out his journey back to his old stomping grounds and the sign on the interstate says, Indianapolis 36 miles, Columbus 250, and the next city listed is PHILADELPHIA, some 680 miles away.

631,johngmiller,True vapidity,5,13 October 2006,"David Cronenberg has made a career out of making gory horror movies based on an intelligent precept. His best work, such as ""The Fly"" or ""Videodrome"", made you think and vomit simultaneously. He has garnered such acclaim from his contemporaries that he was named President of the Jury for the 1999 Cannes Film Festival.I'm not sure that his newest film, ""A History of Violence,"" will harm his reputation. But I really can't see it helping any. In the previously mentioned movies, there was plenty of gray area between what was good or evil, real or imaginary, to let you draw your own conclusions. Instead of offering options to ponder, ""History"" hammers home the answer: You can take the man out of the violence, but you can't take the violence out of the man. So much for ""the new flesh"".Viggo Mortensen, who plays tortured protagonist Tom Stall/Joey Cusack, must have been aghast to see his excellent portrayal sabotaged by the ham-handed moralizing. Ed Harris (Carl Fogarty) and William Hurt (Richie Cusack) also give stellar performances that are almost worth the price of admission.But most of their work is lost to the surroundings. Much of the blame belongs to screenwriter Josh Olson. Tom/Joey doesn't talk much, so the bulk of the pithy dialog is saddled on those playing his family, particularly Maria Bello (Edie Stall). She performs her role like an over-the-top drama queen. But if I had to spew such drivel as ""What are you, some multiple-personality schizoid,"" I would be desperate too. It's no wonder she agreed to full frontal nudity. At least she'll be remembered for something.The film's violence is graphic and brutal; truly splashy gore. But this raises the question of whether it's really necessary. Does that bloody-pulp-of-a-face propel the story, or is it simply exploitation? Maybe it's a metaphor for Tom/Joey's inner psyche, where violence is no longer shocking. Either way, it doesn't matter. The metaphor is too obvious to conjure any serious thought. I might as well be a 16-year-old at a slasher movie (""Did you see that guy's face? Pass the popcorn!""). Overall, ""A History of Violence"" is as literal as its name implies. If you want to watch Mortensen dispatch his enemies with deadly, grotesque precision, this film is for you. Otherwise, don't bother.",A History of Violence

Loved the ads, love Viggo Mortenson, and the critics were so enthusiastic about it how could I have ever expected the total suckfest I then endured on a rare 80 degree October afternoon in Minnesota?? There was no exploration of Tom's past and transition into his present - just the feeling that you were seeing the shadow of the guy he once was. A shadow who maintained his lightning fast reflexes and ease of killing with his bare hands in spite of roughly 20 yrs since he escaped his past and started a new life serving coffee and tenderly tending to kiddie nightmares. The sex scenes and close ups of corpses were gratuitous and pornographic. I hate writing that, because I just know some pompous jerk is thinking we midwesterners just can't handle sex. And close-ups of corpses. It's not that, it's that these scenes, while I suppose relevant in illustrating Tom/Joey's contrast and his wife's continued loyalty and more intense attraction to the rawness of the Joey side, felt completely out of place and unnecessary. That's the sex part, I have no idea why I needed to see somebody's caved in, bullet-riddled face. So you take a slow moving plot, add a scent of a story with no real meat, gratuitous scenes that just made you squirm, and a blonde kid who too closely resembled Christina in Mommy Dearest child-acting her way at the sidelines to the point of distraction and you have an exceedingly disappointing expenditure of both time and money.The only good thing about the entire movie was Viggo Mortensen himself. I love this guy, he's one of those rare breeds of actor who you never see as the same person. You know how Brad Pitt is always Brad Pitt in a movie, and Tom Cruise is always Tom Cruise? I like Mortensen because I forget who he is when he gets down to business. He's brilliant and well-cast in what should have been a better-written, more fascinating movie. His honest, good-natured, sincere, small town dad is such a contrast to the glimpse you get of who he was in his other life. My favorite scene in the entire movie was when he met the driver at the bar, and the driver introduced himself and said, ""Are you Joey?"" Viggo responds, ""Yeah, I'm Joey."" And he says it with this tone that up until then you'd never heard in his voice. There was an edge there, a crack in the Tom Stall facade, and to me this was a more significant crack than any of the violence he exacted on the bad guys. I'd have loved to have seen more of who he was as Joey, I think the contrast Mortensen could have created with a better backstory would have made for a more interesting film.",A History of Violence
633,lmiskg,Trash!,1,30 April 2006,"This film left me so speechless I have been moved to write a review and hopefully drag its rating down to its natural level (somewhere between 1 and 3). Where to start? The plot starts out being relatively well-founded but quickly peters out. There is a sub-plot involving the son, Jack, which is beyond pointless. The plot is full of holes such as where are the kids while the parents are getting hot and heavy in the middle of the day, how come having sex on the stairs is even viable after being shot in the chest, and so forth. The acting is, for the most part, good, but the direction is so off, the scenarios and imagery are laughingly heavy-handed, clichéd and plain bad. The two sex scenes looked like they could have been written for soft-porn movies but they are excruciatingly drawn out, to the point where I was embarrassed for the actors. They were completely passionless and I was left thinking ""What was that all about?"" However, those scenes were nowhere near as confusing as the full frontal from the leading lady (Maria Bello). It was so bizarre and distracting in its context that again, I just felt sorry for the actress. As with any modern film you think it is all going to come together at the end but in fact the final scene is beyond ridiculous in its bludgeoning triteness. I have to say I loved Lord of the Rings and really thought Mortensen would have great savvy in picking his next roles. Last week I had the misfortune of seeing him in Hidalgo and I thought THAT was bad.

His gritty, exploitative examinations of the human psyche are in a class of their own, especially in today's market of intellectually vacuous films. It is for precisely this reason that films like A History of Violence enjoy enormous critical acclaim, but fail to generate any real audience interest. Cronenberg refuses to pander to the lowest common denominator in his audiences, a practice that today's viewers simply aren't equipped to benefit from.The deceptively simple plot of AHOV follows one man through a violent personal catharsis sparked by events fundamentally beyond his control; not a new theme for Cronenberg. A persistent theme of ""good"" versus ""bad"" men permeates the film, ultimately serving as an ideological foil for the revelation that such polarized moralism may not be either practical or accurate. In the case of the protagonist, it is neither.I've added AHOV to my Cronenberg collection. It'll be there whenever anyone feels the increasingly rare need to enjoy a truly great film that transcends the banalities of suburban life without suffering from American Beauty-esq heavy handedness.",A History of Violence

What I don't like about it it's too simplistic in the character outlines. this guy is a sheep till he's supposed to be bad, then suddenly he becomes a monster. Wiseguys are stereotyped to a cartoon like appearance, the faces try to be realistic but they end up being cartoon-like too (William Hurt as a wise guy? come on, the accent makes you wonder if he's retarded or something), there are no subtle transitions in behavior, violence is inserted in this crude way, also sex is, the affective ties change like crazy to suit the story, too American for my taste. As I said, it's just too rough, a little polishing of the whole thing would go a long way. Why I make a fuss about subtlety? Those are the little things that make me come back to myself in the middle of a movie and say ""Ok, it's just a movie"". And that ruins it for me.",A History of Violence

Like Fight Club, the end was much different than the book, and it was still good.But this movie altered the plot so drastically, it doesn't even feel like the same story after about the first thirty minutes. They didn't even use the same name (in the book he was Tom McKenna, and in the movie he was Tom Stall)*spoilers* In the book, when Tom is in the hospital, he tells his life story to his family, centralizing a robbery that ""joey"" and his mob brothers were going to do. This was the bulk of the story. But in the movie, they simply focused on Tom getting his revenge on his former crime boss.The movie wasn't terrible in itself, and I probably would have enjoyed it if I hadn't read the book first, but I can't believe how the writers adapted this screenplay so poorly.So, if you've read the book, don't watch the movie.

A History of violence is a good film but maybe not a unique one, as Cronenberg is a unique director.I suppose that Cronenberg made a successful move into making crime films, especially when he made Eastern Promises after this, but I believe that Eastern Promises which is usually compared to this, is maturer in every aspect.I somehow didn't find it an original work by the director, but anyways It was great and certainly worth watching.

BUT I'm afraid to say that for once i cannot comprehend all the praise this film has received in the press.I get the point - character study of reconditioned ex-mobster and effects thereof on family of aforementioned ex-mobster. Great! unfortunately, the complete lack of character development rendered the vast majority of the film completely useless.The film was so stereotypical that it was embarrassing! not only was the portrayed 'love' between the main characters far too sickly and over the top, it was quite simply an excuse for hard core porn, and the most random full frontal nudity scene i have ever sat through. I have to admit, i couldn't help but laugh at the sheer pointlessness of them! Lets look at a quick synopsis shall we - Mr Goody Good Good, VERY normal cafe worker loves wife, has explicit sex with wife (dressed as cheerleader) kills random criminals (very violently) who come to rob his cafe. Is then tracked down by his old mobster friends. He is also a mobster (hence the title of the film) Family are disgusted, so he eventually kills his old mobster friends and has more explicit sex with the wife. He then, for no readily apparent reason, goes to hunt down and kill (very violently, once again) his mobster brother. Comes home and has meatloaf with the family (we assume that after the credits roll, he throws wife on table and has more explicit sex, but this was cut from the final version) To me that was about as deep as it got!! i managed to buy into the matrix explanations, but this is just a bridge too far!!!! waste of hard earnt cash!",A History of Violence

Bill Hurt has a very, very limited range to begin with, at least I think so, and this role was beyond a stretch, I didn't believe him as that character for one second, his attempt at a Philly accent was not even admirable, how must Ed Harris feel, he was great in this completely menacing and cold, he gave the best performance in the movie and no recognition.

It looked very good, and I loved how the focus was more on the character of the main character than the plot. Viggo Mortensen is one of my favourite actors and he doesn't disappoint here. Unfortunately, his family members aren't quite up to his great standard and it really shows. His son does quite well but seems to act and talk more like an adult at times instead of teenager he still is. Worst of all were Viggo's wife and his daughter.However, some of the smaller roles in this movie were awesome. Viggo's brother truly pulled off a great cameo. I loved it! Yet there is one thing about this movie that will stop me from ever watching it again. It was truly difficult to get through the sex scenes. I never can understand why movies have sex scenes any way. Why do these people think I want to look into this most private of acts? Especially if it's between a husband and wife, as it should be. It's such a beautiful thing, but it is ever only something for a husband and wife to enjoy, not for the world to watch and enjoy. And there was so much of it in this movie.

The rest is just pure filibuster and flat out boring. Do yourself a favor and only watch the preview, because thats pretty much the only parts of the movie worth watching (unless you are into a couple of awkward sex scenes and gunshots). For real, this movie was a joke. I can't say enough about how ridiculously drawn out it was and how much it totally blow-ed (past tense of blows). Just in case any actors in the movie are reading this, they all did their parts. But just in case the director/writers of this movie are reading, wtf were you thinking? I truly and honestly can't imagine how anyone could have found this movie ""gripping"" or ""intense"" or anything worth praise.

648,Alex_Pete_Georgie_Dim,What Did I Just Watch?,5,12 June 2013,"I put this DVD in expecting something on the level of Straw Dogs, where,a normal man's attempt to save his family brings him to a dangerous grey area with his own morality. What I got was something I should have seen from a mile away once I saw David Cronenberg's name on the cover. What I got was pure Cronenberg, a film that attempts to cover up its T.V movie level acting and low quality script with a bunch of blood, gore and sex.Let's get this straight, I have no problem with sex and violence (My favorite film is A Clockwork Orange, so if I did that would make absolutely no sense), but the way Cronenberg uses it is just pathetic. ""Is this scene going nowhere? Just start having sex! Yeah, right there, on the stairs! Is this stand off going on to long? Just kill everybody! Make sure blood spews everywhere so everyone knows what they are watching is graphic and mature."" It's same problem most video games have. Trying to make something mature by dumping gore on it just makes more immature.On top of that, the story has many of the characters are just plain bland. The bully at the beginning who gets upset because Viggo Mortensen's son caught a ball, is the one of the worst characters I have ever seen in a supposed ""Drama/Thriller"". He would be more fitting in Revenge Of The Nerds. Cronenberg couldn't figure out how to end this plot line, so the son just beats the bully within an inch of his life (""look at how complex and mature it all is!""). The two guys at the very start seemed to be interesting. Why couldn't the movie have been about them? Whatever their doing seems to be ten times more interesting than what the actual plot is. They end up dead just so we can have a way tor the mafia to find Viggo. Wlliam Hurt's character is the best part of the movie, and he's only there for about ten minutes before Viggo shoots him in the head (""Hide your kids! It's to mature for them!""). That seems to be a theme for this movie; whoever is interesting has to die within ten minutes of appearing on screen.Like I've said, this is no Straw Dogs. There is no grey area, everyone fits neatly into good (the wife, the son, the sheriff), or bad (the duo at the beginning, the mafia, the bully. They try to make Viggo's character seem in the grey, but he simply jumps from one side to another without ever being in the middle. All I can say is it has admittedly good practical affects, but that's a gimme for Cronenberg, he built his career off of it. Unfortunately he hasn't improved his other abilities, and tries to use these affects to cover it up. Don' t let the Oscar nods fool you, avoid this flick.",A History of Violence

The sex scenes were forced. The plot was crap! I went to see this film with high hopes because I like Viggo and I read the graphic novel. This movie was crap! The climactic beginning took 9 years to happen and the film slowed from there. If you want examples of long boring stretches of needless film footage, here ya go. The highlight of the film was when the sound went out and everybody in the theater started adding their own dialog! Viggo was not quietly effective, he was just quiet. The only reason I did not give a 1 was that all the plot supporting elements were good. The plot was just plain bad! If you have seen the trailer for this film, you have seen all you need to see!

651,fragbait,"Pathetic, useless and - well - violent.",3,21 November 2005,"I will make this my shortest comment so far.I saw this movie two days ago. We had a vivid discussion about it afterwards, but I will only mention why this film did not work for me:The story of the movie is so blunt and banal as it comes: ex-hit-man starts an extermination trip when his past catches up on him. Of course this also effects his family life, since his wife and children did not know any of his crimes long gone. Don't worry, I did not spoil something for you. There's no doubt, not for a second, that he had learned to kill in the past as he disposes of the two killers that try to rob his coffee shop.Now, as the title suggests, this movie is full of violence. To guess that it is a history or analysis of it is utterly wrong, though. It only depicts some violent deeds in one persons life. Often, the brutality doesn't contribute anything to the story, and is anything but essential. The film includes a quite disconcerting rape / sex scene, and tries to morph into a Kill Bill for the pauper towards the end. Of course, it miserably fails. The extent to which this film enjoys to splash blood, shoot people in the head or the like is unsettling at the least.So why don't I give only 1 out of 10? The reaction of the family, almost braking apart by the incidents and discoveries, is worth seeing.Ashton Holmes, playing the hit-man's son Jack Stall, in particular displays some impressive acting. Also, I can't really blame the film for its violence with such a title. But be warned - this is no film for families, nor for thin-skinned persons. It isn't pretty, nor is it entertaining or suspenseful. I don't suggest going into it. Watch the DVD if you must, and see for yourselves.3 out of 10.",A History of Violence
652,fourGrand,"Idea was good, acting sucked.. except for the big 4",2,30 September 2005,"The idea of the movie itself was pretty cool, but all of the supporting acting was worthless and totally unbelievable. The 'jock' in the film was absolutely ridiculous and there was no follow up to the brutal murders that took place on Tom's lawn. There were no police investigations, no mass media coverage, and certainly no investigation into the fact that the three mobsters he murdered knew him as 'Joey'. If they had a police file on this Joey character, wouldn't he look exactly like Tom????? The sex scenes although realistic were totally unnecessary and were obviously added for shock and a nice 15 minutes of filler. Viggo's character Tom aka Joey has no personality, but somehow gets to have rough sex with his wife on the stairs even after she finds out he's been lying to her their entire relationship, and that her last name, and their kids isn't real! Don't even get me started on the kids; they had no personality and the attempted relationship between the fathers history of violence and his sons hallway bash with the bully was laughable.

653,GrizzlyB,"Good story, good characters, and entertaining.",9,23 April 2006,"This was an entertaining and interesting show which featured an actor who is very much a non-charismatic, yet ultimately impactive star. The story translates well from the book and gives you an idea of what 'witness protection' gone wrong might be like. OK, so there are bit of Steven Seagal scenes, but not as many as the title would suggest, and in fact they are good...and well balanced with the story. Maria Bello is an undiscovered talent who should be doing other large stuff and is now maybe a younger and more current 'Sharon Stone' type of sex attraction. William Hurt does a really good mob guy, and is instantly believable in his role. Perhaps a bit too brief tho..as one wonders more about the history of 'Joey and Ritchie' and what the horrific past ruckus was all about. Maybe for another movie. Ed Harris is as good as it gets for a colorful mobster and again we wish to know more. A fair amount of Canadian talent is evident, which I appreciated, as well as some of the background. As the story would suggest, as well as the sub-story with the son, sometimes violence is an inevitable.",A History of Violence
654,crushtv-1,Most Overrated Film In Years,1,5 April 2006,"Does this movie really deserve one star? Considering the talent and experience this movie had to work with, I 'd say yes. Missed opportunities should count for something. Considering the expectations built up by the professional critics, I'd say some balance is in order.If you come to this movie expecting or even hoping for a good movie, you will be disappointed. If you open the DVD packet expecting a really good movie, you are going to be annoyed and a little angry. That's was me.For starters the pace of this movie is glacial. For a movie to use silence to develop character or tension is one thing. Jim Jarmusch, for example, is famous for using long silent shots with a steady cam to build comic tension. On the other hand, to offer long sections where literally nothing happens for no purpose other than to get this very thin plot to 90 minutes is another. Which brings us to the plot.The plot of this movie seemed to have been pieced together while the crew set up. Not only is it paper thin, it made no sense. We spent the whole second and third acts interjecting statements that started ""Well, why didn't...?"" and ""How did he...?"" There is a subplot where the teenage son is being bullied. For what? Because he caught an easy pop fly ball during baseball practice. As someone who experienced bullying first hand, my reaction to that and the progression of the entire subplot was ""Give me a break.""The title of this movie, its marketing, and many of the reviews promised an ambivalent investigation of violence and the way we look at it. There was none of that in this movie. The whole promised theme was a farce. The bad guys are very bad, they all clearly deserve whatever comes to them, and they are dispatched quickly with remarkable ease by a man who was given no real choice in the matter. The bad guys are appallingly incompetent. In short, you can get as much investigation into humanity's ambivalent relationship with violence watching Arnold Schwartzenegger in ""Commando"" or Geena Davis in ""The Long Kiss Goodnight"".The action is lame lame lame. If you are young enough to think fight scenes are thrilling where the hero moves around the room killing bad guys while the other bad guys stand around waiting to get killed or shoot at the hero from 10 feet away to little or no effect...if you are young enough enjoy that, then you are too young for this movie padded as it is with gratuitous gore and nudity.If a good movie is defined as one in which you don't know how it will end and you don't know how you want it to end, then this is the opposite. I knew for 30 minutes into the movie that it could only end one way (it would have been sooner if the story had moved at a moderate pace) and the only way I cared for it to end was ""more quickly"".",A History of Violence
655,tragic_slider,"Uneven plot, but with some great acting",5,10 March 2006,"I was excited when I sat down to see this movie. But then I was excited to see ""The Usual Suspects"" as well. An hour and a half later I walked out disappointed.As the story of unassuming Midwesterner Tom Small and his family, the film starts out with a reassuring warmth and attention to detail. By the end of the film, the tone has morphed into a Steven Seagal flick, complete with a battle royale in a mansion that wouldn't be out of place in ""Scarface"". The central theme of AHV seems to be that violence is inescapable everywhere, even in the most Mayberry-esquire of quiet towns, so at what point of aggressiveness can we blame those who out-brutalize the predators to protect others and themselves?? An interesting idea, perhaps, but one that is handled clumsily and with a certain lack of direction in this instance. As a ""man with a past"" story it fails utterly, practically the whole story given away as soon as the scar-faced Ed Harris sits down at Tom's diner (accompanied by two equally cheery dark-suited companions) and addresses him with mixed familiarity and contempt as ""Joey"". The only question that remains is how the future of violence will play out.BEGIN SPOILER DETAILS The central conceit of the film is that a brutal tough from the streets of Philly, a man who apparently delighted in cruelty and took out an enemy's eye with barbed wire, can transform himself into a laconic family man without any hint of his former life in his new personality. The further the story went, the more irritated I became with soft-voiced Viggo Mortensen as Tom/Joey. Viggo plays a convincing Tom Stall but never once shows the raw aggression and dominance that mobster Joey must have had. Further stretching the imagination are his perfectly maintained ninja-skills (looks like Walker, Texas Ranger led some workshops in Philly back in the day). What an utterly poor decision in casting.Speaking of which, the family dynamic is generally tin-eared. The interaction between Tom and his son lacks any sense of connection between them, just as the two sex scenes with Maria Bello seem oddly contrived. It's the supporting characters who give the movie life, with particularly magnetic performances by Ed Harris and William Hurt as acquaintances from Tom's past life. (Seeing a mild, bespectacled Hurt at the Academy Awards made me do a double take -- what a remarkable transformation he pulled off in his thoroughly menacing eight minutes on screen.) Some people may complain about the graphic violence but to me that was one of the movie's most redeeming qualities. The ugly, final consequences of violence are not shied away from. On the other hand the family themselves are transparently designed to be our protagonists as they progressively rip through two armed robbers, a sneering bully, three goons, and a houseful of mobsters without much hesitation. (I can see the script now: ""Conflicted Hero gives the camera a troubled look at having to resort to violence. Conflicted Hero then does a backward roll out of danger and gives it to them with both barrels."") The recipients of these respective beatdowns are so clearly Bad Guys that they might as well be wearing name tags announcing them as such.""The Matrix"" and ""Fight Club"" both had the conceit of an Everyman who was actually a superhero/bad-ass underneath once he let himself free of the shackles of his mind. Despite this pandering both were fantastic movies. AHV tries the same trick but is tripped up by a lack of direction and outrageous inconsistencies.",A History of Violence
656,kairanga,Some disturbing questions,6,26 March 2006,"I enjoyed this film a lot. However there are some nagging questions.If the story is about Tom Stall, why is the film starting with two killers? Isn't enough for them to burst into the diner and kill people? Do we need to know that they were professional killers? I think this movie had too much time for what it wanted to tell. So some padding? I could see that the diner staff were chilled and shocked at the ruthless dispatch of the killers by Tom Stall. The local cop is suspicious. There is enough going on to alert not just the local police but FB Eye as well. So how come our hero goes wherever he can without being pursued? How come the local cop is so nice when he suspects (may be eve knows) that our hero could be a gangsta? Doesn't the cop want to keep his job, the most noble intention of anyone? There was no character arc. Edie goes from all-love to hatred but not with any consistency. The ending is good but somehow there was no payoff. I was expecting Sarah Stall to run to papa and hug him as she would not be in state to understand everything about what dad did. Heidi's acting was contrary to my expectation.Both sex scenes were not organic - somehow planted gratuitously.This should have been a James Bond film, not the life of a diner owner in a small town. Somehow there are some missing pieces. It is more like an abstract art. Perhaps that is why Cannes liked it.BTW I loved both Viggo Mortensen and Maria Bella. Ashton Holmes was great.

This duo must be contenders for the deepest voices in film. I used to think Kathleen Turner was really hot, and she was in Body Heat and some bizarre film with Rutger Hauer I can't remember the name of. Its scary seeing some actors growing old. Its not so much the ageing process, but rather when they morph into someone else completely.

Pointless sexual scenes and nudity in ALL the wrong places and the 2-3 action scenes look more like they were taken out of some reality show because they weren't accompanied by the regular ""PAW"" sound that goes with every ""Hollywood punch"" but rather accompanied by splattered blood all over the screen.

660,damianj,Audiences will be divided,7,17 October 2005,"A History of Violence will invariably leave everyone who sees it with something to think about, but probably not all in the way director David Cronenberg had in mind. Powerful, graphic and well-acted by the cast, especially Mortensen, the drama explores the culture of violence and whether its possible to live free of it, but leaves too many questions unanswered. Mortensen plays Tom Stall, a normal guy with a normal life, a wife (Bello) and two kids, who owns a normal small town diner in America. His perfect world is turned upside down when, two thugs enter his diner and attempt to rob the place and rape the waitress. Normal quiet spoken ol' Tom however has other ideas and, much to the surprise of the entire town, takes out the pair like a seasoned hit-man. He becomes an instant hero, and his face is splattered across the national media, attracting the attention of some bad guys from the big smoke, led by the menacing Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris). Fogartyand his henchmen show up at the diner claiming that Tom is not Tom, but actually a notorious and very violent Philadelphia gangster Joey Cusack. Tom denies that he is Joey and claims he has never met Carl or any of his henchmen, but Carl doesn't take no for an answer and starts a campaign of harassment against Tom and his family, which culminates in more bloodshed, this time on the Stall's front lawn. It is an engaging thriller, that if nothing else, does have you questioning just who is telling the truth  is Tom really Joey Cusack? The story is interesting enough to keep you watching until the end, but there are some annoying holes (especially the characters' histories), and in an obvious attempt to paint a contrast between the Stall's idealistic family life and the big bad world of violence it has collided with, the loving family scenes are overdone. The ending leaves many loose ends too, which some film goers will appreciate, while others will just be left confused and wanting some closure. There are a handful of very graphic scenes, both of the violent and sexual nature, some warranted some unnecessary, including a rough sexual romp on the stairs which doesn't really add anything to the story. An earlier scene is borderline pornographic, again for no obvious reason, aside from sex for sex's sake. It's by far not a bad film, and the acting is excellent all round, but its clumsy narrative flaws ruin what could have been an excellent film.",A History of Violence
661,reventropy2003-1,I'd rather have the Pinto,1,11 November 2005,"The general public doesn't go to see a film because of its individual qualities (directing, dialogue, etc.), we go to see a finished product. Films are a lot like machines in the sense that if one part is broken, the machine doesn't work. This is why a history of violence doesn't cut it. The directing could be described as good when compared to everything else I've seen. Nearly every other aspect of this film was a vacuum taking away from the directing (which in itself was not very original). If you went to see this film because of the directing, than that's swell, but at least state that as your reason for having enjoyed an otherwise bad film. If you gave this film rave reviews you love Cronenberg, that is a terrible reason. I didn't know who Cronenberg was until after the movie. The fly was good. Maybe I'd put it in my top 150 list. I had seen spider. What a tragedy. A lot of the reviews I've read sound like a present tense Cronenberg eulogy. Praise Cronenberg! I get the sense that these were written by film student groupies. Cronenberg is a director that is still getting high production budgets to produce college level projects. In this sense he reminds me of David Lynch. And. well, I hate David Lynch. I didn't buy this movie for the same reason I won't buy a 1978 Pinto station wagon. It may run strong, but when it comes down to it, its a piece of garbage.",A History of Violence

The director was just absent, actors were playing just because they were supposed to do that, there was absolutely nothing there, except for the smell of the empty. The drama of a superman who regretted and found the forgiveness inside the Holly Family. Violence+sex+forgiveness, Croneberg didn't make a movie, he copied the Bible. Why do I have to suffer just because he decided to become politically correct? is it a sign of age, of pleasing some, does he need the money or just aging? And the violence scenes(wanna-be-Tarantino, but why would you like to be Tarantino after theCrash?) were pathetic. I just hope that Croneberg had a gun pointing at him while filming, that and the Alzheimer would be the only excuses...PS.That last happy-end scene, with the kids feeding the bad father and the gazing was the worse i've ever watched since the age of the ""little house on the prairie""",A History of Violence

""History"" is a film for moviegoers who have grown weary of mindless action. The brilliance of this film lies within its ability to crawl deep into your subconscious, set up a lawn chair and an umbrella, enjoy an ice cold lemonade, and worry the hell out of you. This film, with all of its oddly-Oscar-snubbed performances, begs its viewers to care about its characters, and one has no choice but to give in. I am in love with ""History,"" and It loves me right back. Thank you, David Cronenberg.

This dialogue runs throughout the whole film. There is no wit or skill in the writing, almost as if it were an amateur who thought it up! In fact, even an amateur would come up with something better than this. Much better. In fact, an amateur would probably have created a much more realistic environment and drawn on their own personal experience to do as such. Hasn't Cronenberg ever been in a fight? Or been angry? Or had a secret he didn't want people to know get out? ""The Perfect Family"" plot is painfully overwrought. Borderline sickening. The score sounds like something out of a Sunday afternoon matinée movie. There is little realism to be had. The character development is seriously lacking. Script writers sincerely need to consider what they would actually say in situations like this. This was confirmed by the age old use in American cinema of the long, drawnout scream of ""NOOOOOOOO!"" Should have went straight to t.v, in my opinion! SORT IT OUT!!! Oscar nominations???

666,jmyoung,I can't believe the number of reviewers who do not get this film,9,21 August 2006,"Wow.For all the people who criticized this film, please check out Ebert's review, which you can get through the external reviews link. It summarizes somewhat eloquently what Cronenberg intended to say (and I believe said somewhat clearly.) To address a couple of the specific criticisms (I don't have time to get into a full discussion.) - (1) The sex scenes - One purpose of this film was to reflect on Darwinism, and survival of the fittest. Along with that, I believe Cronenberg (I have not read the GN, so I do not know what to attribute to the original authors) was trying to show how little we have evolved, or alternatively, how much of our ancestral behavior we have taken with us. The sex shown at the beginning was oral, with implied other activities later. Oral sex and foreplay in general is not found in nature (maybe some monkeys?). It is practiced by a biologically and sociologically advanced society. The sex later in the movie is violent and quick - just the act of rutting. It is a demonstration of the thin veneer of civility.(2) The ending (and I mean the last 5 minutes) was probably the only way this film could have ended. The repercussions of what had been done, will probably affect this family for years. There are no easy answers to our emotional responses.Have to go.",A History of Violence

The actors handled the subject with maturity giving convincing performances. Sounds are mostly natural and camera angles excellent. Slow in pace, the movie builds up the atmosphere and reaches your brain. Yes, this is based on the graphic novel and creates the magic on screen. Viggo Mortensen is at his best and who can ignore Ed Harris. Almost everyone was believable. The movie proves how delicately the subject can be handled and even with the slow pace keep things interesting. Trailer is the biggest spoiler of the movie.

670,daneeta,See it! It's hardcore.,10,6 January 2006,"Saw Cronenberg's latest, ""A History of Violence"" last night at the Prince Charles. Yes, I am partial to Cronenberg films, however, he has outdone even himself.The tag line for the film states ""Tom Stall had the perfect life... until he became a hero."" The plot: small town family man thwarts robbery/murder in his diner, and becomes a media hero, which results in his hidden and violent past coming back to haunt him and his family. This film is a cross between what Todd Haynes wanted ""Far from Heaven"" to be and what ""Old Boy"" did so well.This film is based on a graphic novel by John Wagner and Vince Locke, so I was expecting some over the top bad assed action. Cronenberg soared way beyond my expectations. The film is sumptuously violent...but not shockingly. Every bit of it is necessary and right.Viggo Mortensen plays Tom Stall to perfection. I think this is the best choice Mortensen could have made after the LOR Trilogy...from Christ figure to psychotic multiple personality disordered yet loving father. His performance was outstanding. William Hurt playing against type was also outstanding as were all of the major players.But, it is Cronenberg who really shines. One scene stands out...the ""sex on the stairs"" scene. There are at least three turns in this scene, wrenching your heart from one end of the spectrum of emotion to the other.See it! But, if you can't take violence, beware. It is hardcore.",A History of Violence
671,BjaminDS-1,A Well Made Film,8,11 August 2011,"This movie is simply well made. From it's chilling introduction to it's silent conclusion, the entire film kept me on edge wondering exactly what was going to happen next. The first hour of the film in particular was amazing in its ability to slowly reveal what was going on as we attempted to figure out who Tom Stall was, along with his family and the sheriff. The violence in this movie is naturally very extreme, but not excessive. Ed Harris and William Hurt were brilliant in their supporting roles. I also really liked Tom's son in the movie, who had a very strong Jesse Eisenberg vibe. The film ends rather abruptly in my opinion, but looking back on it, the ending scene was very appropriate given the events that had just transpired and the kind of person Tom is. It's hard to go into too much detail without giving away too much of the plot, so I will leave it and that and say that you've got to check this movie out!",A History of Violence

It was just right. It was a lot more violent and gory than i expected, but this wasn't necessarily bad. The only thing i didn't like was the ending. It was kind of crappy, and didn't show the same emotion as the rest of the movie did. My dad kept telling me how i shouldn't watch it and it sucks, so i was surprised when i actually liked it. Also, I think that the movie should have gone into a little more detail about viggo's characters past and what happened between him and his brother. So this movie was a pretty good movie.

673,TheMoviehead,An Unsettling Film Which Defies Description (nearly),10,7 October 2005,"Leaving this film (just an hour ago now) I heard a phrase rolling over  and over again in my head: ""Wow.  Wow"". I cannot find adequate words  to relate. I found myself saying ""Why?...Oh my god!...How?...Wow..."".  The film touches, it festers, crawls all over and inside you. The film  does (I think) what Cronenberg intended it to do; frighten. I'm  speaking of real fear that is not spoken out loud, not discussed or  screamed about,or even fully understood. The best and only word I have  to describe the film is that it is ""unsettling"".  I won't discuss the points relating to the sexuality of the film but  will quickly address the violence. I read Cronenberg's answers to some  questions raised by the film, most relating to the violence itself. He  mentions that it is ""intimate, nasty, brutish and quick"" also going on  at length on the utilitarian nature of the violent acts in the film.  This is perhaps the first film I've seen to display violence in, what I  consider to be, a true sense. It is over so quickly and before one can  marvel at it, the guilt and terror washes over like waves in a storm.  It's relatively refreshing, albeit downright sickening, to see a film  that can still shock the hell out of what is thought to be a  desensitized generation.  That being said, one must remember that an author, poet, director etc.  NEVER has the final say on what a book, poem or film's meaning is or  what its symbols or set pieces are about. Each person in turn must have  his or her take on the medium. I'd like to close with my final and  wholly overriding thought concerning ""A History of Violence"": It is a  film which I desperately wish to see again but equally compelling is  the urge to never, ever see it again. Never have such strong yet  equally conflicting views about something so trivial as a film entered  my psyche.  The rating of 10 is based on my personal experience with the film, not  necessarily the merit of the film itself.  You may interpret that as you will.",A History of Violence

Any high school drama student could've acted out these characters. The script could probably fit on one piece of paper. Incredibly slow story with not much dialogue. I didn't feel that the scenes really built up much excitement or drama. When climax scenes did occur, I was left with thinking ""ist that it?"" ... which could be a good effect if it is intentional. Unfortunately it was not intentional in this movie.I have rated this as 1 because the current rating of 7.3 is grossly over- inflated. I'm probably more harsh on this movie because I felt jipped out of 1 hr 35 mins of my life by the people who have reviewed this movie previously.

675,Ornithopter,Fails to deliver both as a philosophical inquiry and as an action flick,5,13 December 2005,"According to its director and to many reviewers there is a philosophical depth behind this film. I agree that interesting questions can be asked about the necessity of violence for survival, its use in evolution and whether a person can change his violent nature. The problem with the film, however, is that it fails to seriously address these questions. What we see is rather a basic story of your average American small town guy, being confronted with his past that may or may not be filled with violent acts.When considered as just a film, without looking for a deep philosophical meaning, A History of Violence turns out to be a kind of action-drama that does not have much to offer. The plot develops slowly, does not show any real surprises and the actors offer a decent, but in no way above average performance. The only merit of this work is that it manages to portray violence for what it usually is: shocking, unexpected and uncontrollable. The sudden violent outbursts in the film are over before you realise it, with dramatic consequences to ponder over.Being too simple for a philosophical inquiry and too uninteresting for a decent flick, there is really no reason to buy or rent A History of Violence. If it happens to be on the air, you may consider watching it, but do not expect any grandstands.",A History of Violence

677,entropicflan,A Cursory Survey of Violence,6,17 March 2006,"This film is full of clichés, but that is sort of the point. The director is taking American movies conventions of violence, from western to noir and action, and trying to put them in a different context where the audience can be self-conscious about the ethics of these conventions and their responses to screen violence. That turns out to make for a pretty turgid movie experience in the hands of Cronenberg, one that only middlebrow types (like the kind that populate newspaper film critic land) will enjoy. The only director who could pull this approach off was Peckinpah (see the Wild Bunch, Straw Dogs, Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia). It's too plodding and self-conscious to be a decent thriller, and there aren't enough ideas being presented to make it intellectually satisfying. I don't think the melodramatic score by Horner helps either. A totally overpraised film, and this is coming from someone who likes Cronenberg (at least during the Videodrome era). Still, he's a talented enough director that he's usually worth watching even when he's tedious.",A History of Violence

Where is the Avante Garde, 'edgy' director who gave us 'Rabid'?Nothing in this film comes as a surprise. Everything is telegraphed before hand. It looks more like a bad 'Movie Of The Week' on TV than the latest offering from Canada's edgiest film director.Frankly, I'd rather watch Cronenberg as an actor in 'Last Night' (a truly 'edgy' film) than as the director in this piece of TV schlock.David...David...David...

680,godofsmallthings,One of Cronenberg's best! *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*,10,2 October 2005,"As a rule, I'm not a fan of David Cronenberg's work. Most of it I find too extreme or screwed-up.A History Of Violence is different.A lot of Cronenberg purists have stated that this film is Cronenberg in commercial mode. This is true. However, this does not detract from the amazing job he's done with this film. It's directed beautifully, and the violence- whilst graphic- is never sensationalised.Viggo Mortensen gives what I consider to be a career-best performance as the quiet, decent, hard-working family man whose past comes back to haunt him. His performance is quiet, intense and powerful. Maria Bello turns in a wonderfully restrained yet emotional performance as Tom's wife Edie whose life gets thrown into turmoil by the events of the film. And Ed Harris... well, he's as good as he always is. Even the more minor characters (the sheriff, Tom and Edie's son, the two killers who hold-up Tom's diner) are well acted.The only weak link, in my opinion, is William Hurt whose performance is a bit OTT and elicited laughter rather than any kind of menace. Having said that, it was quite good to laugh after the rather emotional and gut-wrenching build-up. Whether that was Cronenberg's intention, I don't know.I would recommend this film to anyone. It works on so many levels. You won't be disappointed.",A History of Violence
681,lucky13_54,did we see the same movie?,9,21 February 2006,"One of the things I like to do on this site is look at the comments other viewers have made about movies. The first thing I do is go to the option bar and press ""Hated it"" because normally the comments are extreme but they tend to make me think about the negative aspects of movies. And so it was with A History of Violence that I was combing through the comments today and clicked Hated it and to my astonishment I actually found many horrible comments accompanied by votes of 1s 2s and 3s. Some comments went so far as to insult the rest of the viewing audience that voted along with me to give this movie a 7.6. OK, I can normally tolerate opinions very well, but some of these comments are outrageous! Why the hell would you see a movie if it was that bad? And if you saw it because you did not know how bad it would be why would you bother to get online and try to discourage the rest of the population from seeing it even though the majority of that population disagrees with you? Thats as pointless as the negative comments claim the movie is. And on the subject of inner-theater reaction to the movie most of the negative comments are beyond extreme and embellished. They are likely false. I frequent the movies more than average and I have never seen group reactions as described where the whole audience boos or laughs the movie off. This movie I saw three times in 3 different theaters and I never observed any such thing. And I loved the movie, along with most others who saw it, and I saw nothing wrong with it.

682,sushiandrice,Excels in a way you wouldn't expect,9,10 October 2005,"David Cronenberg is not known for underplaying things. His long and varied career includes gynaecology, human/fly hybrids, car wash rape and exploding heads to name a handful. Through all the mental divergence and ""What the f*ck just happened?"" moments, they all delight in one thing: watching you squirm. His latest -A History of Violence- is no exception to the rule (though not as you'd expect) as Cronenberg channels his creative skills into a vehicle that's more socially-acceptable. Revenge.Tom Stall is a decent guy. He's got everything Joe Public would want. Two bouncing children, his own business, and a wife who'll get kinky with him when he wants it. He's making lemonade everyday until two low-time crooks show up at his diner looking for quick cash, and he has to put them in line. Suddenly he's hailed as the town's hero, the saviour of suburbia, but all the media exposure pricks the ears of one Carl Fogarty: a mob boss from Philadelphia singling Tom out as something he's not. The rest is gravy.Let's get one thing off my chest; A History of Violence is a superb movie. Cronenberg is at a stage in his career where he doesn't have to over-expose (and ultimately alienate) his audience to still shock them. Of course it's beautifully shot from the opening, the camera staying pallid and voyeuristic, only to mechanically pan across when the action does in a Conversation-esquire fashion. I love the way he really takes his time setting up a feel-good slice of Americana -riddled with self-knowing clichés- only to have it be torn down by its own inevitable culture of violence. Each thread is explored and fleshed out, then slowly but surely reeled in, catching us with our pants down in the process.Obviously Cronenberg has his notorious reputation for a reason and rest assured both gore and rough sex are present here. But he's far more interested in the people. So sure there are moments to creep you out, make you uncomfortable, except this time the sheer gravitas of the tale and genuine characters involved will stop you running screaming from the cinema. This is a mature, smooth, and slick tale of human drama in place of graphic experimentation that usually misses rather than hits. The on-screen bravura is supplied by a top-notch ensemble. Viggo Mortensen commands an instant respect and sensibility as the unlikely hero. As the character's journey is so bizarre you'd forgive Aragorn for stumbling slightly. Not is the case. He displays all-round family man, hardened killer, and everything in-between, never once pausing to try and smash you over the head with his performance. Maria Bello also is refreshingly different as the wife. Her beautiful portrayal of innocence clutching to an image of self-assurance never falters. William Hurt -when he finally shows up- had me in fits. But the jewel in the crown is Ed Harris, given a role he can really go to town with and maybe finally win the Oscar that keeps escaping his grasp.A History of Violence is the thinking man's thriller, taken from visceral source material and just disgusting enough to keep you entertained. When I finished watching Crash (another film by Cronenberg) I was horrified. But after a couple days you begin to appreciate its power. On the surface it's sleazy trash, but through all the sex, you see the characters have become zombified by the world they live in; the only way to arouse any kind of passion is by crashing a car. The same can be said of Violence, the abrupt ending only contributing to this, when it should only be a glorified Western or a toned down version of The Long Kiss Goodnight. A bitter picture that should stick with you for weeks after. And drinks are on me if you guess the ending.",A History of Violence

I didn't want to see this film at all and in retrospect, I wish I hadn't of bothered.They're both huge Cronenberg fans. Grandma is very fond of 'Crash'- the one about the people who get off on car-crashes. Grandad prefers 'Dead Ringers'- the one about the twin gynaecologists.Since watching these movies I have no longer felt truly comfortable around Grandma and Grandad.Personally, I loathe Cronenberg and all of his works. But sometimes I get guilty about that home Mum put them in so I take them out a couple of times a year to see a film. Or we just drink beer in Leicester Square, providing it's not too cold. They have circulation problems.This film was okay I suppose. I couldn't really enjoy myself as Grandma got drunk too early and kept turning around to wink at these two guys in the row behind us.Then Grandad laughed so hard he lost his teeth. Then he accused this young couple of hiding them from him so he tried to get the guy to step outside for a fight.Grandma got involved and it made think how we ALL have a 'History Of Violence'. This was a big realisation for me.Anyway, the film was hilarious and the gunshot noises sounded very realistic. Grandad said, pointing to the screen ""that is EXACTLY what blood looks like in real life!"" Grandma agreed with this and I started to wonder what the hell they had got up to when they were younger.The film made us all cry. At least I think it was the film.When I dropped them off at the Nursing Home they said ""Hey sonny. How about taking us out again real soon to see another movie ?!"" ""Sure, sure"" I replied.They must be kidding.

684,peelscreen,This film was simply not convincing...,1,16 March 2006,This film is confused about whether its fast paced and in your face for the mainstream audience or well thought out and paced for the art/film enthusiast. The two main characters hardly make a believable couple and their unconvincing near pornographic sex scenes seem out of place. The extent and degree that they are revealed is just not good story telling. I morbidly enjoyed the graphic violence but most will find it unnecessary. There were parts where I really felt I may have been watching a good movie but this film continued to remind me that I wasn't. I think the biggest enemy of this film is its production. There are so many unnecessary STUPID scenes that could have been cut out and this movie could have been something really good (although the ending wasn't believable and offered little reward).

I told myself, oh no, they aren't taking this approach are they? And pretty much they did. I just don't buy a person with multi-personality disorder who is / was ultra violent at one time, can go years while living a Mr. Rogers-esk lifestyle with no other hints at violence.

Seriously, if Cronenberg wants us to see the tragedy of the violence we inflict on one another, he should start by making us care about the characters he's going to foist on us, instead of shooting them blown-out, grainy, poorly-lit, and directing them to give performances where even WE don't care about what happens to them.Seriously, this film is not just a failure -- it is a monumental failure. The audience I saw this with demanded their money back. Hollywood -- here's a tip. Make films with people we care about. Give it a shot.

687,fishy1999,Is everybody on crazy pills? This film was HORRIBLE!!!,3,29 September 2005,"I can say with complete confidence that there was almost nothing redeeming about this film. On the basis of the 8.3/10 vote and the positive review on the front page I went and saw A History of Violence last night. The entire theatre was unanimously appalled at, just to name a few, (a) the absurdly superficial and flat character development (e.g. Viggo's character was always either slack jawed and incredulous or viciously violent - his accent also vacillated between his ""new"" Indiana and ""old"" Philly accent quite absurdly); (b) the completely undeveloped and unbelievable relationships between the characters (especially between Viggo and his wife); and (c) the EXCRUCIATINGLY SLOW, INFANTILE and LAUGHABLE dialogue (with characters often gritting their teeth and looking on intensely in a supposedly meaningful way). I might also add a completely random and awkward sex scene by Viggo and his wife that just didn't fit at ALL.I sincerely can't believe that this film has received such a warm reception from film fans. I know that each person has his or her own tastes, but, really, COME...ON! Cronenberg may be a fine director, but this was an effort that should never have seen the light of day, in my view. I will admit that the basic premise is pretty captivating, but the execution was incredibly poor.",A History of Violence

David Croneberg does a great job with directing - great introduction to the plot with no story holes and presentation of the mystery about the protagonist's character. The film is quite interesting (I ensure you you want get bored these 96 minutes) with great cast including Maria Bello, Ed Harris and William Hurt. Outstanding performance from Viggo Mortensen who, in my opinion, should have been at least nominated for best leading role Oscar.

Not a classic, as may be Videodrome for some people but, if you are reading this, I say: watch the movie.I like the cinematography, not the kind of an ""art movie"", just well done for the history, not that noir, not that white, the acting, well, not special, good, yes but nothing from the other world.It is an adaptation of a graphic novel, maybe not the best history ever told, but again, don't miss the chance, you don't find this kind of movie often, is a good one, it won't change your life, but you won't regret it, take that for sure.One last thing. About the violence, this movie is violent, as, I suppose, most of Cronenberg, and I'm not talking just of violence of shooting or hitting stuff, is a psychological thing, there is violence in the diner scenes, violence in the sex scenes, and in all over the movie, which I really like because is not ordinary, but stylish.

Which apparently a lot of you would be critics are.What gave it away for me and have me howling was the scene where Tom's running home from town. I mean come on that was too much. And the editing of it was great. Every cut scene was from a new perspective and completely different environment. I'm surprised they did't have a scene where he was running through a rainstorm, but that would have been too obvious I guess :).I could see how some people may have missed the whole point of the movie, and thought it was bad, but to sit here and say it was great, without ""seeing between the frames"".... is just sad.",A History of Violence

The characters (apart from Ed Harris) are very flat and I wasn't at all taken by the supposed family dynamics... it all looked rather 'acted'. The sex scenes were totally misplaced and didn't add anything to the story at all. To me it looked like it was put in there just for the sake of it..to be controversial or in your face (quite literally). And what about those sudden outbrakes of so-called crying by Maria Bello....

Initially, Cronenberg sets the audience up with a barrage of slightly over the top warm 'n fuzzies, then proceeds to deliver a sharp uppercut full of brutal, graphic depictions of violence, including the results of said violence, to make his point crystal clear.Violence is ubiquitous - it is in our lovemaking, children at play, every day on our streets, in our art, and in the animal kingdom. We may veil it but it is as natural to us as love, and happiness and sadness.Mortensen's performance is subtle yet powerful, and we can see his past bubbling just below the surface until he is given just the right catalyst.

William Hurt must have been drunk when he did this movie. it seemed like with every cut scene his got more and more inebriated.every time the actress playing the wife came in the room, covered in overacting like the stink of garbage, she ruined every scene. as if the scenes couldn't get any more boring, dragging on, with no music to hold your interest.i warn those who read this, don't waste your money on this movie like i did. and when it comes out on rental, don't rent it. let's pretend this never ever came out.",A History of Violence

I honestly felt that watching this film was a huge waste of time. However, I now understand why I truly hated this film, it was due to the fact that I expected it to be a realistic movie rather than approaching it as a comic book adaptation, which it actually is. I'm sure if I re-watch the movie with that sort of mentality I would enjoy it more, although I doubt I would like it very much. This film is DEFINITELY not for everyone! Those who do not enjoy overly violent films will most likely not enjoy this.

Producers and directors know that and I don't buy the claims of directors that pictures of this kind are meant to convey an anti-violence message. There's big money in those buckets of blood and no money in P.C. The film's three explosions of violence are masterfully done and we don't feel guilty enjoying it because, as in most such films, the ultimate victims are set up as so odious that they deserve whatever they get.Another plus for this film is the well used but ever captivating device of having the violence emanate from a person whose image among his fellows has been benign, meek or even cowardly. (Remember Glenn Ford as the storekeeper in 1950s movie, ""The Fastest Gun Alive""?) On another note, perhaps someone out there can help me and I hope this doesn't classify as a spoiler. Since seeing the film I have been aching with curiosity about a specific locale used in it. The book was partly set in New York, but in the movie the big city used is Philadelphia. A bar called ""The Track 'n Turf"" is a brief setting and one of the characters in a later scene comments on the age of the place. I grew up right down the street from the T&T in W. Phila.

The acting - especially by Viggo Mortensen, Ed Harris, and an unrecognizable William Hurt - is outstanding. Viggo thoroughly inhabits the two characters he plays, eerily switching from kind, meek, family man to cold-blooded, ruthless killer. A few of the scenes - most notably, Mario Bello's seducing of Tom - are pretty annoying, but overall, the script was superb. The make-up (blood, gore, ripped-off faces)for the murder scenes was by far the most graphic, but also the best I've ever seen. Despite his background - and even when you see the criminal in him, Tom/Joey is a sympathetic character, and you can't help rooting for him. Also, the scene in which Tom's son kicks the bully's ass is great. You feel for the whole family - and hope they can pick up the pieces after Tom makes his way home.",A History of Violence
703,Letswrite,Not Well Written,1,7 October 2005,"I'm not sure if the last commenter and I saw the same film. This film began bad and ended worse. The opening scene was not needed and lent no use to the story as a whole. It went on too long and it's pay off was so quick, it was anti-climatic. Character development was terrible. Without ""spoiling"" the film, I'd like to say the characters behaviors were inconsistent throughout the film. The wife would fluctuate. The son grew this super strength late in ACT II. The writer relied mostly on pulses of climatic moments to carry the film out, not story development. What I mean by pulses of climactic moments are gun fights and death of characters that we construed as major characters. Speculatory sex is used, that is sex scenes not written to advance the story wherein after the act the characters reach another plateau of growth or story progression. Sex in this film was just constructed for ""gazing"" as what Laura Mulvey would call it. The things they did. Shame on the writer and director! And I'm not a prude. But, here's why this film made it to the big screen. It relied heavily on known conventions of it's genre. Like a jigsaw puzzle with all the pieces laid out on the table but not put together. We know the nose goes here, the mouth here and the eyes here but all the stuff in between just doesn't fit or is in the wrong place or belongs to another puzzle. But the audience can make a face out of the fog if they look hard enough, and say, ""oh, I saw it. But..."". Also, some dialog could elicit a laugh here or there. It's the sort of humor that captures the male audience 18-49 (hmm, maybe the reason for the speculatory sex scenes). The humor in a sticky situation. But again, it wasn't consistent, just the mark of bad writing. If I could only spoil the movie (this doesn't constitute being called a film), I would provide a very in-depth analysis.

I have no idea how cocky the writer must have been to actually present this - and then they produced it? Here are a few points - And here are the spoilers so don't read beyond this if you don't want to read spoilers (I understand that their sensitive to this on the board)..Let's see this guy is supposedly a hunted mobster however, when TV crews are there - it's OK show my face - no problem -- I'll do the interview ... etc. Look it me in the paper - and no clue someone would find out - didn't even cross his mind - this hunted mobster.Next the Sheriff is in there saying tell me the truth - are you that mobster? He could have obviously looked the guys social up and seen for himself - fingerprints FBI data base - and the sheriff was totally irrelevant to the story - what little there was of it.Next, the mobster with the weird eye - it was taken out by what? Barbed wire? What'd this guy do, sand it down? Did he loop it around the eye and pull it out like a bad tooth? How do you take an eye out with Barbed wire? Next If he was in fugitive protection why didn't he call his fugitive protection person and get the Fed's to help him? Next the mobster with the eye supposedly works for the main characters brother. The brother is not a ""Made Man"" but the eye guy is but - the eye guy works for the brother? The brother couldn't get business because the eye guy was mad - but the eye guy is a chump for the brother...What's up with that? Next - when our main character is found to be Joey or Tony or whatever he kicks into this stupid Italian accent that makes a Saturday Night Live imitation Joe Pesci look real. It was unbearable to watch. But it gets worse, the guys brother and should be Italian with the same accent right? Well he looks and sounds like Rob Reiner - what is going on? Did the brother grow up on the non-Italian side of the house? Finally the brother want's to kill the main character because of? A drop in business. He hurt the eye guy and then the Rob Reiner looking guy couldn't do any business because the eye guy was a made man and angry.

Although on the screen only for a brief time, he is wondrous. His physical transformation for the movie takes someone familiar with his other work by surprise. Movie magic.

709,flexdream-1,Some people will hate this film,1,20 October 2005,"It's clear from reading the reviews and the polling that a significant number of people really hated this film. So, the best I can say is if you think you might be that sort, please save your money and time and don't go. In my defence, I didn't want to see this movie, but was outvoted by my friends, and of the 5 of us, only 2 thought it was crap.So, how might you know if you would hate this movie? Well, it's based on a graphic novel, and the disjointed but linked sequences show that, with no character depth or development, or insight into why characters are the way they are, or why they might have changed. The scenes of violence are graphic, but in a comic-strip innocuous style, with no shocking suddenness, pain, anguish or much in the way of consequences. Contrast that e.g. with Amerian History X, or even the overrated Pulp Fiction. This film has no insight into the human condition, and portrays violence as an answer to problems. The acting is mediocre, but that may be down to lack of direction, and the dull script. The wife is a different person between scenes, and Tom Stall is at best enigmatic, and at worst just vacant. Is there any reason behind the change he'd made in his life? Well, the film is too busy rushing around to fill in blanks like that. There are no dilemmas to resolve in the film, that haven't been done many times before. There is a whole genre of films like this - The Long Kiss Goodnight - which is more entertaining, and Nikita/The Assassin which is more thoughtful and disturbing. So, if you like to think, and value script over action, and already know that 'violence is really a bad thing' don't go. This film is pornographic in regard to violence, and rather than portray it in it's ugliness the hero is marked by his superior violence. Good points - fine work by Ed Harris and William Hurt. Good music. And, the town looked nice. I liked the first sex scene too.",A History of Violence

No it is the cheesy, incredibly lowest of the lowest script. Every star in this movie dies in the next 5 minutes after showing up on screen.

But the opening sequence (a long oner) really set the tone for the movie. Its dark, brutal but takes its time setting things up without getting the characters to have mass exposition scenes.But the core premise of the film is whether this guy (Tom Stalls) really is who he says he is or was he someone else. Right up to the revelation, you really are kept guessing as to the truth and Cronenberg does an excellent job in really pulling you in and really putting you in the characters shoes. The remainder of the film is dealing with the fallout of the truth and again you really feel for Tom and his family.The gore is not OTT but certainly shocking as is Tom Stalls reaction to danger. The sex scenes are very similar; intense and little graphic without becoming pornographic.Through Toms son, very awkward questions are raised. Tom Stalls reacts the way he does because of who he was/is (another point I'll come onto in a moment) but what his son when he decks his bully? It raises the question of are violent/dark sides inside all of us? The scene on the stairs shows his wife unleashing another side of sexuality as she appears to enjoy toms other side. Also, can a person really change who they are? These are just what I took from the film and there is so much more to explore. But the film is well acted, well shot and very well done.

It's trite.Then there are little things to complain about, the portrait of a 'small town life' which really seems phony, an overdone score, etc....things that sometimes can and often are overlooked in other movies...which brings us to the main problem with this flick: There's absolutely no suspense.You can diagnose the situation from nearly the beginning and then it's just waiting for stuff to happen....then not much really does.

715,sr-serious,"Bang Bang, The End",1,17 April 2006,"The only motivations that kept me from burning down my house after watching this ghastly abomination were the intriguing expressions that Viggo Merterson would flash the camera with every time he 'wacked' another 'Godfather wanna be'. That, a few obscene scenes and some other lame fluff pretty much conclude this film: before I could even start to enjoy the essence of the characters, they would be rapidly eliminated, as where the movie in its self portrayed a medioker plot that would desperately cast in any bit of random information simply to make it all 'work'. Although it showed potential, the story left miles of content lacking the slightest elaboration.Besides that, I could expect more from a Chuck Norris joke, except for the fact that I actually found my dad and I laughing at what we joshed to be the ending of such a praised movie when the screen 'blacked out' after the enclosure of a mild scene.

Still aching, I gasped in disbelief as the credits rolled by during the cheap suspense music that concluded this 'thriller' (I'd just as soon watch Barnie murder his whole camera crew (pardon the metaphor) than sit myself through this History of Hollywood Junk again).Unless you actually find pleasure in watching movies that suck up to the concept of suspense, you're better off watching real productions that make you proud to be entertained by such masterpieces, such as Secret Window, Fugitive, etc. I'm really sorry, but it was a disgrace to the film industry and a waste of my time.

716,DrDuane,Complete dreck,1,7 October 2005,"A total and complete waste of time, film, and somebody's (collective)attention span. The film had, literally, ""NO"" redeeming features whatsoever - hackneyed clichés, wooden, two dimensional characters (using the term loosely), and a squandered premise that could have been interesting. Perhaps the reason that the teaser trailer predominantly included footage from the diner shooting...ten seconds of mediocre action surrounded by pointless drivel and bad non-acting...should have been a warning flag. Cable network weekend programming and non-sweeps ""movie of the week"" fill-ins would not have paid anyone for this, let alone even considered running it. I cannot think of anyone involved with this thing who should not feel ashamed.

717,mahoski,Swing and a miss.,3,16 October 2005,"This film missed its own point.The REAL story here should have been the main character's struggle with his violent past. He has seemingly transformed himself. Then, in an instant born of necessity, the violence returns. Then, his turn-the-other-cheek son suddenly erupts in a violent rage at school, and it seems to solve his problems with a tormenting bully. This was a perfect opportunity for the film to focus on ""Joey's"" life-long struggle to put violence as a solution behind him.Rather than get into that complexity, we get ""Rambo Goes to Philly."" He addresses his situation with tremendous violence, then gently attempts a re-entry to the family bosom.We received NO insight into the man's transformation or the subsequent struggle to establish and maintain life as a man of peace. His son's entry into violence was tossed up as a big fat hanging curve ball, just waiting to be clobbered. It carried with it tremendous potential for character exploration.Swing and a miss.",A History of Violence
718,nathancarroll,Spider 2: Viggo vs. the coffee,9,30 September 2005,"Dead Ringers, Naked Lunch, M. Butterfly, Existenz, and Spider all have a lot to say about cognitive repression and screen memories. With A History of Violence, we get another franchise to these contemporary Cronenberg operations, but also a clear sequel --an explosive opposing force to Spider, and just as much about the history of psychoanalysis as violence in film. Sadistic desire not only haunts Tom Stall as a repressed doppelganger, it rubs off on the whole family. Its reappearance is celebrated by the community and country and finally changes all involved once its let out of the bag. Suddenly, everyone is repressing Tom's violent 'other' -and by extension, Cronenberg makes an argument that society is both complicit and culpable in Tom's destruction. As usual, Cronenberg sees the world from the disease's perspective. This is not the history of Tom Stall, it's about the disassociated perspective of cultural violence and its human cost. At the end of the day, it's closest relative is Peckinpah's Straw Dogs. If finally minor work by Cronenberg's standards, it's still corn fields ahead of most Hollywood fare.",A History of Violence
719,schuertje,Most disappointing film of the year,2,30 November 2005,"From David Cronenberg you expect more than an average Saturday night movie. Still, although it pretends much more, that is exactly what 'A history of violence is'. Sure one can act dramatic about the question 'is there murderer in any of us', but (a) there are a million books and movies about that theme and (b) this films adds absolutely nothing to that. 'A history of violence' is a cheap story, told poorly with way to many sideways that lead nowhere. On top of that the acting is pretty average and the casting just revolting (the blonde 2-year-old daughter puhlease!!!). Still, I would have bought it if the film ended when the son shot its father's attackers, but unfortunately Croneberg drags it about half an hour longer to a completely ridiculous ending. From the killing of Fogarty on the development of the characters is completely unbelievable and the need for closure in the final scene just nauseating. For a long time Broken Flowers, where Bill Murray uses this same excuse for acting as Viggo Mortenssen- was the favorite of most disappointing movie of the year, but in the end Cronenberg has won it. I just hope I won't have to sit through anything worse than this for the rest of the year.",A History of Violence
720,william-jones40,Exciting narrative which raises questions about US society,8,14 April 2006,"A History of Violence (David Cronenberg, 2005) The title sounds like an analysis rather than a narrative but, arguably, this intelligent and beautifully acted film is both. The action opens with a vignette of two psychopaths about their murderous business in a motel; it then moves to Indiana where Tom Stall runs a diner, deliriously happy to bask in small town American values with gorgeous wife and two kids. The two psychos roll into the diner; when they try to rape a waitress Tom shows astonishing skill with a gun in killing them both, thus becoming the archetypal hero. Jack, Tom's son, meanwhile teaches a lesson to his high-school bully exercising skills worthy of his Dad.So far, so much an advert for the National Rifle Association, but then a guy called Fogarty (Ed Harris) with dark glasses, two large side-kicks and only half a face blow into town. Dark glasses insists Tom is Joey Cusack, whose mobster brother, Richie, runs much of the crime in Philadelphia. By now Tom's wife (well played by Mario Bello) is alarmed and suspicious as 'Tom' does seem to have displayed some of 'Joey's' characteristics. And when Fogarty and his men try to abduct Joey ( whom we've guessed by now he must be) he shows the fighting skills of a whole SAS regiment in dispatching them, assisted by Jack, more and more a chip off the old block. The action from here on is riveting as Joey seeks briefly to escape his invented new life and go back to his past to achieve, if not redemption, then some sort of absolution and escape.This is very much a film about two glorified but antithetical species of American values: the homespun virtues of hard work, good neighbours and a loving family; pitted against the ultimate individualism of the gangster who rejects all moral convention to seize what he wants. Joey is where they both do battle for his soul but the film is also a metaphor for the whole American historical experience. A liberal, warm hearted communality is born of early arms bearing virtual gangsterism. We observe how it is Tom's current moral worth which is valued by his friends and family; and how his ruthless background as a killer is not judged too negatively. We see that violence has much, too much, to do with America's past and its present, even adding passion, on one occasion, to Joey and his wife's lovemaking. Viggo Mortenson displays an outstanding emotional range as Tom-Joey, the all- American Dad with the dark but ultimately forgivable past. In the final section of the film William Hurt contributes a delicious cameo as Joey's mobster brother, Richie.",A History of Violence
721,mcambarr,Not a classic but interesting,7,28 July 2006,"A History of Violence is a strange beast. I have read many comments that applaud it as a classic but I'm just not so sure. The story had so many facets of the characters left unexplored making it at times very two dimensional. Maybe Cronenberg wants us to learn from the characters actions their true identities identity is a major theme of the film. We are immediately exposed to the theme in the Stalls' role play during sex. The sexual encounters between the couple expose another side to the characters as the violence exposes another side to Tom. The action scenes are excellent and not over indulgent. Its not an action film but they are certainly a highlight. Tom Stalls seems almost immortal but sure, its only a film. They are unpredictable and very superheroesque cool. Its not a bad film, its not bad at all, its enjoyable to watch and interesting to think about afterwards but I can't help thinking it could have been so much better. Tom Stall is such a good character and Viggo Mortensson plays him superbly but I wanted more. I wanted to see more of the younger Tom, I wanted to see Tom in the earlier years with his family. Well worth a watch everyone but lacks a little depth which cannot be replaced by metaphors and meaning in the subtext. Its not a classic as some Cronenberg fans might suggest but will keep most interested. 7/10",A History of Violence

From what I hear, the book was quite good, and I can see how it might be. But, this movie, was bad, very bad. Somewhat entertaining at first, but it soon evolved to a silly totally unrealistic movie that to me almost seemed to have ""showgirlesque"" qualities.For example, the hilarious sex scene on the steps (after the wife finds out her husband is a former mobster) was akin to the pool sex scene in historic flop ""Show girls"". The fact that someone (a director I assume) actually thought this scene was a poignant emotional sexual release is hilarious. The bit with the dude kicking his leg like a dog was bit much...By the way aren't former mobsters suppose to be Italian, and not Polish? Anyhow, about 2/3 of the way threw this debacle I had enough, and had to shut it down. I have absolutely no interest in how this movie ends either, and I hope I never find out.It totally baffles me how a director/producer could actually watch this movie and think they just made something insightful, or even half way entertaining. If I were the dude that wrote the book, I'd be upset. Because you just got clowned...Put it this way, this movie was so awful, I even registered for this site just to tell the world..do please, please save yourself 2 bucks and rent something else, like Dukes of Hazzard, or Gigli, because at least those movies KNOW they are are terrible...gee...",A History of Violence
723,horseman308,Disappointing for so much hype,3,24 May 2006,"I was very disappointed with this movie, despite all of its acclaim, there seemed to be little to get excited about. My primary beef is the lack of character development. At no point do we know much about Tom's actual past. Yes, we know he was involved in organized crime, and we assume he was well known in Philly, but there's not much more. We don't know exactly what he did, other than kill people. We don't know why he stopped, or what he went through ""in the desert."" We don't know how he met his Edie, or why he moved to Indiana. We don't a lot about what he did to Fogerty, or why. We don't really know much about the falling out between Joey and Richie, about why Richie wants Joey dead (yeah, Joey caused lots of problems, but exactly what?). Though it's more of a subplot, we never really get any closure on what happens between Jack and the kid he beats up.There's very little character development and little plot development. The whole movie, even though it's shorter than most, is slower moving than most. It simply seems to drag on, but with little resolution. The ending is not too bad, in that you would expect some serious problems in a family that undergoes such events. But it's called ""A History of Violence"", but has precious little actual attention paid to the history or Joey/Tom's actual violent streak. We learn he's good at it, that he used to like it but doesn't anymore, and that it's been several years since he changed identities. That's it.The acting was well done. Viggo Mortensen did quite well with what he had to work with. Maria Bello was okay. Ed Harris was quite convincing in his role. But the best actor can only take a script so far, and this one was just simply disappointing.",A History of Violence

'Oh yes you are',3,19 June 2006,".........this film starts with a very cool well directed opening scene of a raid on the convenience store by the the two robbers, vicious and cruel they are given 'pulp fiction' style treatment, is this real- time violence or flash-back killings, who are these men, is the younger of the two the main character. The film carries on in good form with the excellent rendering of the heroic actions of Tom Stalls in the coffee shop scene. Tom the wholesome local boy efficiently kills off the crooks, with Vietnam War veteran or ex CIA assassin aplomb. The film asks who is this man, is he a hero in hiding, is he a military trained, is he a psychopath under the home town boy exterior. The story looks good, the introduction of Ed Harris as the mystery visitor adds to the mystery...........until, (which occurs far to soon in the running time of the film anyway), Cronenberg just gives the whole story away in one 5 minute scene.The film making as this point reverted into Panto to as vehicle to exercise the plot, the script might well have read thus to no less effect MAN WITH PATCH - Ed Harris, pulls up on the front lawn with gang of hired goons MAN WITH PATCH 'Your Jonny' your a violent criminal 'TOM 'No am not'MAN WITH PATCH 'Oh yes you are' TOM 'Oh no am not' MAN WITH PATCH 'You gouged out my eye' reveals eye patchTOM 'Oh no I didn't'MAN WITH PATCH 'Oh yes you did' 'your brother is a seriously violent criminal,you have done something wrong in the past' MAN WITH PATCH AGAIN 'Ah ha I have got your son, Mr Knuckles get him out of the car' ---Goon takes boy out of car TOM 'You got me bang to rights, Ill give in' 'let him go'MAN WITH PATCH 'Ill give him to you because am a big softy crim at heart, you can tell me all about it in the car, on the way to place where am going to kill you with piano wire'TOM 'Okay' ---boy runs back into house HERO ATTACKS GOON ON HIS LEFT TOM 'Sorry I have broken your nose with a slick kung fu move' 18 stone muscle man goon just stands there and takes the beating ----hero then takes out other goons with acquired weapon, goons stand still like stuffed targets taking slow mo style impactsMAN WITH PATCH 'By your actions you have just blown your cover ...you must be Jonny after all...ill have to shoot you now' BOY APPEARS WITH SHOTGUN MAN WITH PATCH 'Ugh you got me' -----boy shoots man with patch in back from point blank range with shot gun. Tom hugs boy.The end But no From here the film just lost the plot completely, our Jackie Chan trained hero is invited to his brothers mansion up state ( his brother just rings him out of the blue one night) to face a ritual killing. What exactly had he done wrong to anger them so, for them to want to kill him so badly? We never find out. Not surprisingly his brother and his goons turn out to be another round of stuffed targets to be blown away. Our 'Hero' is in the clear he has now killed off all stuffed goons left standing including his own brother. sadly DC misses his chance to kill this turkey at this point. Well slap my thigh don't you just love the remainder of the film our hero returns back to the home ranch, curiously in a night setting that looked the same as when he left, to be greeted a interminably turgid scene of the disgusted family staring at each other around the dining table. This overly long scene is thankfully broken by his little girl, who should have been in bed in the real world, setting out a place for him at the dinner table. Is this scene supposed to symbolise an olive branch of acceptance that dad is a violent thug and everything is okay now. Oh come on his wife would have been doing her pieces had any other husband just disappeared for two days on killing spree like that and just turned up out of the blue. Then maybe she enjoyed the violent sex scene on the stairs so much that she resigned herself to being able to put up with living with a callous lying murderer. Implausible ending really could have been better scripted. Overall a very good film to start with then very disappointing. Pretty much typical of a lot of American films of late carrying lame scripting and plots that do not endure beyond the half way mark. Clichés used in this film that ruined it for me Criminals drive big black cars with blacked out windows. The hero is an expert in martial acts, highly unlikely. Criminals are philosophical and want to negotiate. Crime bosses live in big mansions out in the country. A villain has a physical injury inflicted years before and is out for revenge. The bully confronts the underdog at his locker in the changing room. The bully and his cohorts confront the underdog in the corridor with banks of lockers on both sides.

725,strummerjoseph,arguably the best movie of 2005,9,14 November 2006,"Arguably the best movie of 2005. Alternately dark, brooding, and shocking, but always engrossing, the film asks many questions about the paradoxes of human nature. And the questions it asks -- about man's propensity for violence, the limits of redemption from one's past, the ostensibly moderating effects of societal and family life, social acceptance and integration on the one hand, and rejection and alienation on the other -- are so pertinent. Superb performances from everyone involved, especially William Hurt and Viggo Mortensen, the latter in a mostly understated, and therefore perhaps, curiously under-rated performance. The reliable Maria Bello is also memorable in a role that a lesser actress might not have got away with. But ultimately, the film bears the director's unmistakable signature.

The film took on a very unique feel, and remains in your mind long after you've finished watching it! The ending, poetic and brilliant, blew me away.

How can it be possible that this was nominated for best adapted screenplay? The dialogue was laughably bad and the story was absolutely ludicrous. I honestly think this nomination is the biggest miss by the academy. Literally not one interesting point of diologueThe acting? Terrible. Ashton Holmes' performance is hands down one of the worst I've ever seen. How any of his scenes made it out of the editing room is beyond me. All of his scenes with the high school bully, who was also an abomination, contained every clique you could think of. How Holmes' caught the bully's pop fly? What an interesting point of conflict for the two ""enemies""! William Hurt was good but an Oscar nomination for less than 10 minutes of screen time? Not even close.

Fortunately, it didn't take long before I found people with a similar opinion.Just another film on violence really.The film was done well enough. But in terms of its insight into violence there was nothing that hasn't been done before and done better.At the start of the film I thought that we were going to explore the issue of violence from the perspective of the films different characters as follows: 1/ The opening scene characters - these guys can slaughter a little girl to get out of paying an invoice and not have their pulse rates alter. A load of crap really, but I figured that these were symbols of the extreme that man can get to.I figured the film would then explore the road that can progress to this.2/ The bullied son  you've seen this done better in other films and even on TV. He was perhaps the example of innocence crossing over into the world of violence. The film doesn't really explore the issue  he goes from innocent wimp to hardcore emotionless ""yeah, whatever, I put him in hospital"" dude in an instant.3/ The main character  Tom Stall. This character was quite enjoyable. The emergence of the violent character from underneath the mild mannered shop owner is done well. He becomes quite menacing actually. I see the whole ""can a man be reborn, can he leave his past behind him"" philosophical angle that the film goes for with him but again it could have been explored and developed more. It doesn't really analyse how the emergence of his violent side affected his family relationships. Without this the question of his redemption is not resolved.A few reviewers didn't seem to understand the point of the sex scene. I thought this was pretty obvious. Its looking at the angle of whether a women is sexually turned on by the primal (violent) side of men. In the film she is. Such a philosophical question. For me it didn't ring true of real life. I'm pretty sure most women don't want to be raped by their husbands. Cronenbeg is pretty sexually messed up in my opinion  I suspect he doesn't have a lot of success with women in real life.Cronenberg for me is a cerebral director who is less skilled at exploring and capturing feeling and emotion.The film makes some efforts in this regard but doesn't nail it and for this reason the film fell short of expectations for me.",A History of Violence

Yes, true, it is a while since I have seen a 69, and yes I admit that I was childish and thought 'but what about the hobbits'.But take the scene where mommy demonstrates that she is unfamiliar with guns, whilst daddy is running through fields with a bad foot to save them. Which then develops into a scene with the son wanting to know why mommy was running round at breakfast time with a gun.OK, he's a timid, dope smoking teenager but wouldn't he ask mommy? Instead of sitting in the kitchen watching mommy, through the doorway, acting strangely while he chews on sugared wheat puffs (which he 'made' himself).But of course not, this is an 'adult film' and the director is a 'genius' and this warping of the time/place/realism narrative vortex (don't worry if this is too technical for you, this is an adult review, and I have a PHD in media studies (which may or may not be true)(but this is a review with themes and depth and subtext))...the 'why doesn't he ask mommy why she is waving a gun around for a curiously unspecific length of time' question.... (which must be at least ten minutes or why else would Tom/Joey/Hobbit-bloke make an issue of driving to work)...is an exploration of the Oedipal complex. And his repressed desire for this mother is demonstrated by his inability to light their joint fire by beating her up on the stairs (can anyone explain why there was a 'rape' scene in this film, and why she didn't just go to the police, who she is clearly friendly with (the sheriff having kissed her) and say 'my husband has beaten me up and raped me, and btw he is not the man I married and is in fact a a killing machine akin to the terminator) (Or indeed, how come the police had nothing on this 'Joey' but did have information about all of the other 'bad people'?) (or why no-one had noticed that the man at the café has lightening sharp reflexes, marvellous spacial awareness and a magical ability to read situations? I guess they all just put it down to good service).And there is the muff scene. Which at first might seem gratuitous, but since this is an adult film, dealing subtly with complex themes, is obviously there to show that no one is who they really seem and she is not a natural blonde.The only person to come out of this with any credit is Denise Cronenburg for the costume.This is puerile nonsense. Yes David, we know that violence begets violence. And yes, we are aware of the cinematic conventions of random murder solves all problems, and that love and family life has to be shown in saccharine sweetness (without breasts (see 'muff scene' (or indeed any of the 'sex' scenes)).

And while his notorious past confronts his family's understanding and ultimate approval of him, he cannot reconcile himself to the fact that he must again resort to aggressive acts in order to redeem himself in their eyes.Yet the movie is also a narrative in the violence that erupts in many personal clashes that everyday individuals follow over the course of their average days. In this respect, each individual is bound to this social contract, to the inevitable confrontations that challenge them.

What triggers us from rational beings to blood-thirsty animals? When is violence truly necessary? Are we BORN violent? With a terrific script, flawless acting, and expert direction from David Cronenberg, this remarkable film presents them. On the surface, it seems like a generic action/vengeance film. It has evil villains and a straight-forward good guy. Underneath is were the true genius of the film is. How violence and carnage can change everything in a second. Even what it can do to a all-American family. The last scene in the film is memorable because it asks us these questions. Today though, there isn't any easy answers for violence.Viggo Mortensen gives a amazing duel role. At first he is quietly restrained, then is merciless. He is definitely Oscar-worthy. Maria Bello is beautiful and lovingly-convincing. She makes it seem like these two were meant for each other. Ed Harris and William Hurt almost steal the movie with the few scenes they have on film. But, this is really Cronenberg's show.A lot of people will not get this film, and that is a shame. I just hope they don't criticize the ones who did LOVE this film. That's all I have to say about them.Please keep an open mind when watching this piece of pure film-making. This is now (in my opinion) the best film of 2005.",A History of Violence
738,mhickcox,Mayberry RFD meets Kill Bill I & II,6,3 October 2005,"I really have mixed emotions about this film. I too laughed at some of the oddest moments, or perhaps, perfectly choreographed ones. Before we went to see this movie, I did read some of the other comments, which helped me decide to go with my husband alone, and not with my 16 year old son and his two friends (thankfully!).I will be surprised if there aren't some Oscar nominations for this film.This movie reminded me of watching a bad accident unfold before your eyes on the freeway. You are totally engaged and have to keep watching, knowing it is going to get ugly. You want to look away, but your eyes are riveted to the scene. Creepy. There were moments when I thought I'd made a mistake and was watching another Tarrentino film.Did anyone else notice the Howard Shore score? Were there not times when you expected Frodo, Sam or Gandalf to break through the action and come to Viggo's aid? That kinda ruined the whole seriousness of the film for me...especially at the end.",A History of Violence
739,govegove,I really don't understand what people see in this painfully adolescent film,2,2 November 2005,"This movie pretends to address violence and rape in an emotionally and morally complex fashion, but it's just pretend. It's ultimately small-minded and sensationalist. It isn't the intense and disgusting violence that is most disturbing, but it's the adolescent, belittling treatment of the serious psychological issues which surround that violence.I went to see it on the recommendation of a friend I respect. I'm still not sure how to have a conversation with her about it.The acting looked like it was done by freshmen on their first day of drama class. Maria Bello needs to go back to acting school. Mortensen was trying to portray a confused guy with difficulty communicating, but the whole ""psychological"" element didn't come off well. The scenes were written to make convincing acting impossible--they were just so ridiculous. As someone else said, his whole running-with-a-hurt-foot-to-save-his-family thing was just embarrassingly. His stammering in the café to Ed Harris (""My name isn't Joey."" ""Yes it is."") did zero to make me feel like I was in a real, busy diner, let alone watching two real people talk. The scenes with his son and the bully looked like they were from an episode of The Wonder Years that got axed for being too goofy. When we get to the end, and William Hurt is there as his brother shooting several times at point blank range but missing him, and suddenly the movie tries to get all campy... the whole thing was just lost, lost, lost.Let me back up here. A History of Violence tries at different points to be a) serious movie, b) a shocking wannabe early-Tarantino, grotesquely-violent-but-it's-okay-because-it's-""deep"" movie, and c) a campy, almost Princess Bride type movie near the end, and then d) going for a challenging, serious ending.It fails at being a serious movie because it is unbelievable and the psychology behind the script has the emotional intelligence of Mickey Mouse.How does it compare to early Tarantino? Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs made me say ""God, I never want to see that again, but I'm glad I saw it once"". It was grossly violent, but in a good way--shot characters didn't just disappear, they had a horrible groaning and bleeding persistence for an hour or more. And the dialogue was a brilliant. A History of Violence is a pale, pale rendition of this. We have some really nasty blown-to-bits heads that are squirting and breathing at us. And for what? I couldn't even enjoy a good ""ewwww...."" Why? Here's the crux of it: A History of Violence raises very serious and complex issues, but deals with them in an adolescent and self-mocking way which is so condescending and belittling that I find it personally offensive. They key scene is where the husband attacks and rapes his wife, but isn't necessarily a bad man, he's just lost and confused. There is gray area here, and it is opened up for us. They almost pulled it off. One spark of brilliance I did see in the film was Mortensen collapsed and confused with his pants down, at the bottom of the stairs. But the overall scene was unrealistic both in the details (there would have been words, she would have screamed his name, said ""you're hurting me"", said ""stop it"") and unrealistic in the context of the whole movie's psyche (in other words, his little Jekyll and Hyde thing didn't come off). Furthermore, the campiness of the rest of the movie, and its attempts shock value elsewhere, belittles this effort to seriously confront the gray areas of domestic violence. Watching the movie, I felt in my heart and in my stomach the rape scene boiled down to sensationalism. You can't be so idiotic and then try to engage the audience seriously on such a touchy subject. If you wanted to confront this issue, then don't be half-arsed. Make the characters complex, not caricatures. Make the son holler when his brain-splattered dad tries to hug him. In real life, compassion might come to other family members for a violent father / husband. But in this movie, the compassion wasn't earned, it was forced. And it felt like being at a family gathering and being told to hug the same uncle that molested your younger sister. I won't do it.I myself was assaulted sexually by a friend, and I learned to have compassion for my attacker--even if I didn't forgive him. I would welcome a movie that could deal with this. But instead of making Tom Stall a complex character, it creates a faux complexity. It goes beyond a sitcom mentality only by a step: it says with emotional scriptedness, ""You will feel conflicted here, but still be empathetic."" In trying to force a candied sympathy with Tom Stall when the performance was too cheap to be believed, and in bringing about a resolution that is too easy, this movie comes close to glorifying the violence and rape that it tries to address seriously.It becomes unredeemable when it tries to become cute, clever, and funny near the end. William Hurt plays Billy Crystal playing a mobster. And then, suddenly, we're supposed to be deadly serious again. If the movie can't even take itself seriously, how am I supposed to? This movie was a good idea. If it had more believable situations, if it had decent acting, and if it could take itself halfway as seriously as it asks you to take it, it could have been a real contender. Sometimes were hints of greatness, and the possibility of a powerful psychological piece was there.But it fails. Don't believe the hype. Have a good talk with your friend instead. Or watch Bowling for Columbine.",A History of Violence
740,npetrikov,Rewrite!!,3,23 October 2005,"Beautifully shot, well-paced action flick. Unapologetically violent, but not over the top--in fact, the denouement is anticlimactic, as far as death and gore are concerned.The dialogue, though, is from hunger. If you're going to base a movie on a comic book, choose a Marvel classic, with plenty of vocabulary and wit to boot, or re-write it from scratch--using some two-syllable words, just for fun. The cast said almost nothing more interesting than the action-flick equivalent of hi-honey-I'm-home.As for the probability of the plot, it was just the sort of escapist fluff that's one of my guilty pleasures. There was a fair sprinkling of ludicrous moments that I like to think were intentional, starting with the opening scene, in which a character drives his car from his motel room to the motel office--a distance of approximately ten feet. He must have been a Californian.",A History of Violence
741,nhutchind,Potentially good story... dies out before going anywhere,4,3 December 2005,"As far as I could tell, ""A History of Violence"" was made just to test the limits of how far a movie can go in regards to gore and sexuality. The story had great potential to be a very rewarding, interesting story, but it got swallowed up by the attempts to shock the audience with its content.1. Cheerleader Sex. Don't get me wrong... the cheerleader outfit was nice, but was it necessary for Edie (Maria) to show her panties, through which you could obviously see her pubic hair? Then, was it really necessary for the sex scene to be as graphic as it was? Tom (Viggo) having his face buried between her thighs and them writhing around on the bed as she wiggled around for the 69... not really necessary for the movie (to be that graphic, I mean). I realize that the director was trying to show how much in love they are with each other, but I don't think I needed to see Tom doing a face plant in Edie's netherworld.2. Graphic Violence. I love violence (in movies). I love the action and suspense and thrill of it all. I am used to seeing gore (don't ask). When I saw some of the shots in this movie, such as the scene in the diner when Tom shoots the guy on the floor in the back of the head and you see the guy's ""face"" quivering and spasming because the guy isn't quite dead, even though his lower face looks like hamburger... I laughed. Not because it was funny... not because the effects weren't good looking (they were), but because I couldn't believe that they were showing this in a movie. You've got to realize that a lot of the movies out there with violence in them either don't look real or you at least know in your head that the premise is so ""out there"" that you can't believe it. A History of Violence looks real and seems real. Besides that, the other deaths in this movie are obviously done for shock value because of the severity of the kill, and the way the camera zooms in to let you see the twitching spasms of death. Why else zoom in on a quivering mass of bloodiness?3. Rough Sex. Step aerobics takes on a different meaning within this film. Tom pretty much almost rapes Edie on the stairs. How else do you get from her slapping him, him choking her, them throwing her down on the stairs for a quickie (and it is quick Tom must be descended from a rabbit). I was uncomfortable during this scene, and from what I hear, so were the actors. They had to use stunt pads to film it. Stunt pads! The next scene shows Edie with a bruise on her back because they wanted to show it but they actually had to put makeup on all the other ones that were there from shooting the scene. 4. Full frontal nudity. I'm not sure about this one. I know there's the whole ""Basic Instinct"" thing, though I've never seen it and I've heard it's hard to see. In this movie there was no hiding it. Edie walks out of the bathroom with her robe undone and stops for a few seconds. All you see is face, boobies, and bush and then she walks out of the scene without saying a word. Was this necessary? Could she have not walked through the room with her bathrobe cinched? What did it add to the story?5. Craptacular ending. This is the last thing to rant about. The ending simply sucked. There was an overall unsatisfying climax with Tom/Joey killing his brother and then going home for some meat loaf (fade to black). What happens next? Don't give me that crap about making up my own ending. If I wanted to think I'd have watched Jeopardy. I watch movies for the same reason I read books and, yes, I get upset when an author takes the easy way out and says ""Joan didn't know what lay ahead of her, but whatever it was, she would be ready for it."" What the hell? Overall, my main complaint about this movie would have to be the ending. I can deal with the sex and violence, but I prefer that there be a reason for it. The main problem with the violence and sex was that some of it seemed ridiculously unnecessary and that other films with the 'R' rating don't have the same level of content that this movie does, leading to movie goers not being warned of what lies ahead of them.",A History of Violence
742,outislandart,I can't believe I waited to see this movie!,2,16 March 2006,"My expectations were deflated after I saw this movie. ***Spoilers ahead. Mortensen's character is totally unbelievable. A high school junior drama student could have done a better job. I didn't believe for a minute that his character had been a hardened killer. Maria Bello did an average acting job and was believable at times. The kids have to go! The son was annoying and whinny. I felt like slapping him silly. They must be sons and daughters of somebody in Hollywood. Ed Harris, one of my favorites shouldn't have taken this role. When he was acting I felt I was watching an animated Dick Tracy movie. The robbery scene at the café isn't even logical. Two hoods come into town and rob a tiny café? Everybody knows those places don't have much money. A liquor store or mini-mart would have much more money than a diner. The sex scene after the big fight? Anybody that's ever been married knows that doesn't happen. What's with the cheerleader outfit? When we meet Stall's brother towards the end, I couldn't help being reminded of the SNL character that plays keyboard with his wife at high school assemblies and sings cover tunes. What's with the end of the movie? Are we as viewers supposed to turn off the remote and enter deep thought about the stares? Whatever, I'm sorry I rented it.",A History of Violence

Low production values combined with high school drama level acting really just left me wishing I had chosen a different movie to view.I have also always enjoyed Cronenberg's ability to leave enough to the imagination but this film seems like he left all of the work up to the viewer. It was work just sitting through each flat exchange. Each actor delivering lines with a leaden weight. The dialogue from each conversant hitting the floor with a thud before the next actor talks.Cronenberg has always liked to take his time in setting up a scene but the time it takes to get through each frame is interminable. This wasn't a movie. It was a trade film showing how to do a read through and block a scene at the same time.",A History of Violence

This is where the story became unrealistic. I think the son's fight scene at school was unrealistic. His character seemed to be an intelligent everyday kid, and then all of a sudden he has super-hero fight moves. I didn't see the need for it to be so dramatic. He could have just stood up and fought for himself and had the same impact on the later confrontation with his father.Then final sequence with ""Joey's"" brother really made this end as an everyday entertainment movie rather than a good what's going to happen next flick.

The beginning is consistent and you feel that it's going to be a thriller. Once you the movie is midway through, it gets predictable. The acting is pretty bad.

The only real problem I had was the outrageousness of the high school bully character and that whole story line. The only thing I can guess is that the bully was supposed to mirror the viciousness of the Motel/Diner robbers. That could have been done better, but I won't get into it.Where this movie fell apart for me was when he went to Philly to see Richie. The dialogue was idiotic ""You finish your beer, we get into the Escalade and go see Richie."" Did GM pay for that ad or what? It just got worse from there.And if you think Richie and his four inept body guards were the only ones looking for Joey, you're in for a big surprise.

A massive rewrite might bring it up to the level of filler in a Tales From the Crypt anthology but only if a story of some mild interest was added. The violence is graphic yet unrealistic. South Park and Team America had better characters and acting. The best acting is the mucus flowing out of Maria Bello's nostril in the rape-love scene.

749,scdemandred,Highly Overrated,4,5 March 2007,"I was extremely disappointed by this movie. It had received high critical acclaim, and I expected more. My complaints: - Maria Bello's reactions were utterly unrealistic; her behavior that of a movie ""dragon lady"" rather than a devoted wife. The stairway sex scene is particularly indicative of this. If she was so revolted by the reveal that Tom was once Joey Cusack, why would she go from rage and disgust to incredibly horny for rough sex and back to rage and disgust in the space of 10 minutes? In real life, even the most painful problems are mitigated somewhat by sexual contact. Her character was poorly articulated and acted woodenly.The sex scenes themselves were superfluous. The first one was meant to be part of the setup of Tom and Edie as an idyllic, nuclear American Family of the new millennium (we are sexually healthy enough to address various kinks like roleplaying, even if it makes us vaguely uncomfortable to do so), but it felt tacked-on. I don't need to see that to know what the filmmaker wants me to understand about the family.Sarah's reaction on Tom's return from Philly is ludicrous. The son's reaction is believable; dad went to Philly to do *something ominous* and he's back now, what's next? The little girl should have jumped up and run to him squealing ""Daddy!"".There was a considerable effort made to impregnate every nuance of the final scene with great weight and meaning. It was done in a heavy-handed fashion such that the final staredown between Tom and Edie was painful. Sarah's slow march to get the place setting - carefully and deliberately placed on the sideboard in case dad came back *tonight* (Who the hell does that??) - and the son's tense passing of the meatloaf are examples of trying too hard to imbue meaning where there is already plenty of meaning inherent in the scene from the first 7/8 of the movie.This was my first Cronenberg film, and it does not make me eager to see any of his prior work. If his other films are this heavy-handed and obvious, there's not a lot of incentive. It struck me as a film that the critics really wanted to like because it was so ""real"" and ""gritty"" (a la the stinkfest that was 21 grams), but I think they missed the boat on it.",A History of Violence
750,DanielOgle,Great opening spoilt by pedestrian ending,6,14 March 2006,"Cronenburg has always been one of those directors on the edge, with this movie he merges his penchant for gore with that of extreme violence. This has a patient and enthralling opening, but doesn't allow the idea to expand. I came away a little disappointed with the journey Viggo made to meet his brother, played almost in a Cameo by John Hurt. There was no tension, might have been better to let the audience know that Joey/Tom was in trouble and was then motivated to see his brother.I was only convinced by Viggos portrayal of Tom. His alter ego, never seemed to gel overall, turning a very cool idea into something predictable.",A History of Violence

During the whole movie I was waiting for it to get started, when do we get to the point in this movie? But it wasn't until the screen turned black that I realized it was already finished, what a deception. None of the characters get any background information, which is really a bad thing because you don't get to identify yourself with them and so you really don't care what's going to happen. Not that really a lot happens... there are a few action-scenes but it looks like all the scenes are just grabbed together without really a common purpose. There's absolutely NO build up in tension or whatsoever, it's a complete waste of your time, you'd better go watch Rex Hunt on the Discovery Channel.",A History of Violence
752,gedroberts1961,Huge disappointment,5,16 November 2005,"Having read the reviews, i was looking forward to this film immensely. Everyone seemed to be raving about Viggo Mortenson's performance.However, I can only say that this was a huge disappointment.The beginning was so sickly that it would have failed a Disney film review board for stickiness. The story then continued with little or no logic, for example it would have been obvious to Tom/Joey that he knew the Fogarty character, and similarly the Fogarty character knew that he knew. The film could have at least been entertaining for the public if this question had continued to the end, but having admitted this 2/3rds of the way through it left the film with basically nothing to add.With respect to VM's performance, at no time did he convince that when he became Joey, that he was actually a very violent and very psychotic bad man. His performance was portrayed more as an avenging hero, which the Joey character was not.Even the extreme violence interspersed with quietness and calmness became a so what feature, a sort of ""oh look he's pushing that man's nose into into his brain, whatever next"". The interchange of pace was far better done on Saving Private Ryan.And finally the ending, which like the beginning, was almost from Family Movies 101. Children want daddy back.All in all, a very disappointing film, and one that I would recommend that you wait until it comes to TV and save yourself some money.",A History of Violence
753,rebel7254,"Entertaining violent scenes, good actors....not much else",5,20 March 2006,"I really expected more out of this movie. I was disappointed that it was nearly 100% predictable and slow-moving.For starters, the opening scene is basically a waste of time and it doesn't really contribute to the movie. Basically they could have cut it down to 2 minutes instead of nearly 10 minutes, because the main guys in the scene do show up again later. But you can understand why they didn't because that would shorten the movie even more than the barely average length of 96 minutes.Then we have the sex scenes. The first sex scene in the movie was also way too long and completely unnecessary. The second one was just dumb. If you watch it you'll see why. I suppose it could be designed to metaphorically link lust and violence or whatever as another user has suggested, but it's basically just another waste of time in my view. By the time all the unnecessary content in the opening scene and the sex scenes are eliminated, we end up with about 80 minutes of meaningful film.With all that being said, A History of Violence has a couple of good things going for it. The performance of basically all the actors is quite good. I especially liked Ed Harris and William Hurt's work in the movie. The scenes with Viggo Mortenson's character laying the smack down on the other guys are well done and entertaining. I would have gladly traded the sex scenes for two more of those. Though far from being one of the goriest movies I've seen, there is plenty of bloodshed to go around.There is nothing really special or captivating about the plot either. I wouldn't say that the movie ""sucked"", but it I wouldn't label it as ""good"" either. The actors do a good job with what they were asked to do, and the violence is pretty well done. But the predictability and mundaneness of the storyline coupled with too much unnecessary content in a just barely average length movie really hurt this one.

756,obsen,If only.....,6,22 October 2005,"*** Spoilers included!***""A history of violence"" is a movie that could have been something. It is one of those movies where the word ""if"" has a special meaning when thinking about what you have seen. The story is quite simple. ""Man lives in a small place and is the ideal husband. Man kills two men trying to rob his café. Man is contacted by gangsters who claims that he is a violent criminal running away from his past. Man turns out to be a violent person and goes on a killing rampage. Man goes back to his family."" Well, if you ask me this sounds like a rather clichéd story. And that is the trouble with this movie. It is a history of clichés hidden beneath scenes of graphic violence and some poor sex scenes. (The people who cry out about the sex scenes in this movie should see ""Baise-moi"" and ""Irreversible"" to see how sex can be used with a purpose in a movie. In ""A history of violence"" the sex-scenes seems awkward and without a real point.)You will not waste your time if you see this movie, but neither will you remember it in one years time. It is the little things that prevents this movie from reaching the top.

757,ekk2k,"An amazing film with depth, sensitivity, intensity and superb realism in its acting and message!",10,16 October 2005,"A History of Violence is a film almost for thought and not meant to be picked apart and analyzed by everyone who sees it. It embodies so much depth in not only in the way the film is done but in the nature of the human race also. In this there should really be two reviews to describe David Cronenberg's quiet and superb film lying under the radar of the mainstream media at the moment.The film opens with a stoic scene; drawn out and quiet. Two unknown men outside a motel, getting ready to leave, but soon enough the motel office opens up to a horrific scene caused by these two men, but the mood and character of the scene stays constant. It's now that the audience know that this is not just going to be a psychological thriller, but a film with a social commentary that is highly disturbing and not easily understood.The catalyst for this commentary is Tom Stall, a man who kills the two men from the first scene when they try to rob and terrorize his quaint diner is Millbrook, Indiana. Instantly, he's a hero, but questions rise as the agile way in which he killed these two men is noticed. The movie begins to unfold, with Ed Harris mistaking Tom for a man named Joey who, back in Philadelphia, was the trouble maker of some sort of crime organization. Tom's son also has to deal with the aggressions of a cliché bully. And the fun begins.David Cronenberg has been deemed one of the best directors for gore and violence. In this movie, when there is violence, it's noticed. The amount is not overwhelming, but it certainly makes a statement with its gritty realism, graphic and extremely well filmed feel. In a sense, the whole movie is like that. The intensely dramatic story of Tom Stall in accompanied by very real and very sensitive depictions, usually involving his wife. The audience ends up relating to the situation more than they ever though they could. You begin to think that this could happen to you.Viggo Mortensen and Maria Bello made the movie exceptional rather than great. They complimented each other completely and brought the intensity and also contemplation of both roles to life. Viggo's complexity was confusing and overwhelming at times; he was a character that should have been feared yet couldn't be by anyone viewing the film or by his wife. Maria Bello played a wife unlike any character I have seen before, she is the other half of the film. She plays the role perfectly, and with as much vigor as Viggo, and in the end she has you wondering about her state of mind more than his. Both actors should get nods from the Academy and although it's too early to tell, wins too.The film focuses on not only the extreme depiction of one man's 'History of Violence' but it captures it within society and human nature. The ever-present inclination towards aggression and the knowledge that it is present in everyone. Tom Stall represents a passive, loving, middle class America kind of man, and it is disturbing in the fact that he doesn't transform into something different, it is that he always has been. The real complicated twist is not only this message of disturbing facts, but the message of acceptance and defeat when faced with this violence and aggression. A contrast of resistance and temptation is depicted in the movie also. In the second of two extremely graphic sex scenes, the passion of hatred and violence clashes with human sexuality and is mirrored within it. Human sexuality and violence in the movie particularly between Tom and his wife are so realistic and so human that the audience can't do anything but realize the proclivity of human nature is dark and disturbing, and social, civilized societies are simply masking the degradation and passion hidden within every Tom Stall and family.Aggression is repressed, and let out when it can't be controlled anymore. Therefore, are we nothing more than animals? If not, are we not lying to ourselves by accepting these discrepancies or are we slaves to them and can do nothing more than try to absolve ourselves? Why do we react the way we do in these circumstances? Why can't we stop it? A+",A History of Violence
758,thetwacorbies,Deeper than the average thriller,9,1 October 2005,"I just saw 'A History of Violence ' and I thought it was fantastic. When I first heard about it, I figured, ""It looks like it will be a damn good thriller,"" and I liked the concept. I didn't realize (or maybe I forgotI don't like to read too much about a movie before I see it) until I walked into the theatre that it was directed by David Cronenberg. Then came the opening scene, and I knew that it was going to be more than just a good thriller: it was going to be interesting. (CONTAINS SPOILERS)A conventional thriller would have begun with the idyllic family scenes. But Cronenberg gives us this odd little vignette of two cold, sadistic killers. Who are they? Giving them a story before they appeared in the 'main' story was a lovely touch. Every character in the film was fleshed out. Even the small town cop seemed to have a real life, and a past, without one having to know anything about him. Then there's the scene in 'Tom Stall's' front yard, when he confronts the gangsters. I've seen Viggo Mortenson perform this bit of magic before, but it's very impressive. His back is to the wall, he has no way out, and in a close-up, his face changes. It's not overacted at all, but it's very clear that this is a different person. Even his voice and accent change. I felt very happy watching that scene. I love the way that David Cronenberg played with audience expectations. Regarding the same scene, in which 'Tom' faces 'Fogerty' (played by Ed Harris) and his henchmen. The way it is resolved is the kind of scene you'd see at the end of a mainstream thriller. Bad guys dead, family group-hugs, happily ever after. But this scene was placed in the middle of the movie, and it changed everything and everybody, and not for the better. We never see, or think about, what happens to these threatened family members after the credits roll. This movie does. So yes, I definitely think that this is a movie worth watching. Unlike many thrillers, the ideas and the implications will stay in your mind for a long time.",A History of Violence
759,d-sorin24,What's up with all the good reviews ???,6,20 August 2019,"This is a mediocre movie at best.Partly interesting story, bad acted storyline, badly directed, poor plot, in the end, the only good acted and believeble parts were the sex scenes.My advice, if you want to see a good movie, try something else.",A History of Violence
760,CaptainBlastem123,Completely Ridiculous,3,13 October 2006,"**WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!**Let me start off by saying how unrealistic, over the top, and poorly executed this movie is. I really don't understand why everyone has decided to hold this movie on such high regards. Granted, I really do like all the actors in this movie, especially William Hurt. But, I feel this movie just didn't play out the way it should have. From the start, we have what looks like a promising movie. It opens with two characters that are apparently heading east, while killing people and stealing money along the way. The story does follow these characters for a bit. BUT, they stop into Tom Stall's (Viggo Mortensen) Diner. They are killed shortly thereafter by our almost unstoppable hero. This plot event starts up the main story, but also ruins many potential elements that could have been explored. First off, we know nothing of the two antagonists at all. We don't know why they're heading east. We don't know why they're killing everyone and stealing money. To introduce such extreme characters as those, and kill them off soon after without explaining anything, is very annoying and rather pointless. It is not good movie making to fool your audience into thinking that two characters, with such potential as those, are nothing more but expendable pawns, especially if the story follows these characters. They are given a good amount of dialog, we are slightly let into their side of the story, but thenit's over. Very, very poor movie making. Next, in walks Carl Fogarty, (Ed Harris) who claims that Tom Stall, is in fact Joey Cusack, a former gangster in Philadelphia (Or some nonsense like that. The story isn't very elaborate in anyone's past.) Carl and his men decide to stalk Tom for a bit.then they eventually come straight to his house where we have another very sad movie sequence. They try to force Tom to come with them, Tom ends up beating up one of Carl's henchmen by overly breaking his nose (almost taking it right off with the palm of his hand, which is completely ridiculous. I actually laughed). Next, he somehow manages to shoot the other one in the chest several times. Ed Harris shoots him in the shoulder, (He was about 10 feet away. If he was aiming for his chest or head, he is a worse shot then a storm trooperbut hey, that's your awesome Hollywood movie writing right there.) Tom falls down on the ground, Carl walks up and does what EVERY SINGLE BADGUY IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE Hollywood MOVIE DOESHe points the gun andwowHe Doesn't pull the trigger. Instead we have ""Any thing you want to say before I kill you?"" Do I even have to say it people? Anyways, right before he pulls the trigger, Tom's son blasts Carl in the chest with a shot gun. Hmmm.Haven't I seen a movie before where the antagonist gets the hero on the floor with a gun to his head, but instead of pulling the trigger, he spouts off some lame nonsense to increase the tension, but milliseconds before he pulls the trigger, someone shoots him?? WOW!! That's like every other freaking movie. Thank you Hollywood for your originality! So, we kill off Ed Harris? Genius Probably the best actor in the movie..Oh well. Expendable, Expendable.I would also like to mention this movie has two very pointless and completely unnecessary sex scenes that are quite comical. I don't know, I was under the impression that a serious movie is supposed to NOT make you laugh. Both scenes were more unconvincing then any of Bush's presidential speeches. Moving along, we hear from Tom's brother, Richie (William Hurt). Tom goes to Richie's place. Richie tries to have his men strangle Tom. Ah, but Alas! Tom manages to escape the wire that's being pulled around his neck, crush another guy's throat, and snap someone's neck, then; Richie shoots at him and misses about 4 times. HE'S 10 FEET AWAY! Where did we see this before?? Looks like William and Ed need to get down to the shooting range. Anyways, Tom kills the rest of Richie's henchmen, and then kills Richie. Good job Mr. Script Writer. It would have been far more dramatic and realistic for Tom to get gunned down by someonebut nope. Mr unstoppable strikes again. What we have here is a movie that plays out almost like a lousy Steven Segal flick: completely incompetent antagonists, nearly invincible hero. Lame story mashed in between to soften the blow of typical Hollywood trash. Result? That's right! Trash!Thank you, and happy movie watching. Rob",A History of Violence
761,Tacoloft,Expect the longest 2 hours watching this movie,2,7 October 2005,"I was stoked to see this movie, in fact I was convincing myself I was going to like it. I sit down, the movie begins, and I wait forever for it to start! Unfourtunatly it NEVER starts. This movie is not unlike a long date with a hot girl that never gives you any action until you drop her off and she gives you a kiss. You end up with the worst case of blue balls with this movie because the flirt session the actors have with the camera NEVER ENDS... you end up finally getting a bit of action at the end and then the action is over. I wanted an action film and all I got was some stupid friggin Oscar wannabes eating up the film that could have been used to move the plot along. Movie pacing was like watching paint dry. Big competitor for the longest ending ever. And I thought Return of the king would never end... This was a big let down but deserves a 2 for the hairy taco and the 69 action and still only getting an ""R"" rating. Now pulling that off was entertaining...",A History of Violence

763,JeterRach286,very disappointing,4,7 November 2005,i don't know much about exact movie and film rules about angle and directing but i can tell you personally that this movie sucked. The acting was embarrassing and awkward to watch and you leave this movie with so much left open. after you watch a movie there shouldn't be 10-15 things that you have to explain to yourself. why did he leave philly? why didn't he tell his new wife the truth? what was with the desert? what actually happened to him in his transformation? what was with the sex scene on the stairs? As a movie lover i watch movies for entertainment and sometimes to think about more abstract ideas but this movie had neither. Too much was left unsaid and was terribly unrealistic. i was hoping that there would be an awesome ending but was terribly disappointed. it was too short and just not a good film. Not recommended,A History of Violence
764,moviemofo-2,A very relevant thriller,8,4 October 2005,"I saw A History of Violence on its opening day and I still haven't stopped thinking about it.It represents a realistic view on how violence is used today and how it affects the ones we love.Only two things bothered me since the screening, and neither has to do with the movie...First, the audience in the theater I was in - Were you so uncomfortable with the sex scenes that you had to snicker and comment like a bunch of high-schoolers? History portrayed a happy couple with a very healthy sex life - but all you could do was behave like Beavis & Butthead - grow up! Second, one of my favorite things to read are the ""Hates It"" reviews of movies I enjoy - mainly to see if my admiration for movies were truly unfounded. Many thought the movie didn't adhere to strict reality - that the actions of Tom Stall near the end weren't documentary-realistic.A History of Violence is a tale - and a dark one at that. It gives us a compartmentalized scenario and plays it out in a very brutal and heartfelt way.Along with Lord of War and Constant Gardener - A History of Violence forces us to look at our world in microcosm.More movies like this should be made.",A History of Violence
765,shockdoctor,A history of boredom,1,4 October 2005,"This has to be one of the worst and most boring movies I have seen in years. The movie starts off slow and somehow manages to get even slower as it progresses. The only decent action sequence was the diner scene, and after that everything else is laughable.The ""bad"" guys all act unrealistically. They can't fight, can't aim a gun, and pretty much exist just to get killed. In most movies you hate the bad guys, in this movie I just wished they would kill Tom so the movie could end sooner.The actors all do a decent job, but none of them truly shined or made their character interesting enough to save the movie. Even the softcore porn scenes weren't enough to interest me in the movie.All in all, this should never had made it to the big screen.",A History of Violence
766,krygsman,A hidden treasure.,8,25 July 2006,"I never rate an action flick over 7. Normally any movie with a lot of violence in it never even reaches a 6. That's because most of them simply don't know how to keep a good story line that is also believable. This movie feels like a drama while it has more excitement then most of the movies I've seen lately. It has been a long time since I got excited watching only a car drive by on the screen. Most directors find a way to distract you from the fear that the characters are experiencing but David Cronenberg really knows how to keep your attention.When I watched this flick I didn't expected much, after all it's an action movie and I only watch those to waste some time. This movie got to me, just like ""American History X"" did in 1998 and I never expected to be as much surprised ever again.",A History of Violence

Having just come back from the film, I am totally surprised by how bad it was.The story was not believable, the characters were under-developed, the acting unconvincing, and all in all, it was unbelievably bad! Every scene in the film felt as if it was there to prepare for a big scene or message at the end of the film which never happened.

A great premise and a great beginning, this movie takes a horrible turn for the worse and becomes nothing but pointless, sadistic, and poorly acted. Viggo, normally a phenomenal actor with incredible range, makes his character go from father of the year to cold-blooded killer with very little transition and none of the mystery implied from the trailer. Ed Harris, yet another waste of talent in this movie, portrays an aging gangster with a vendetta, but all intrigue is lost when the writer gives up on him after only 4 scenes. And another thing, who ever decided that William Hurt would be the perfect Mob Boss, has clearly never seen any of Mr. Hurt's work. A Mob Boss should at the very least appear somewhat...oh what's the right word?...tough, manly, sophisticated, cold-blooded. These are all words that never have and never will describe William Hurt.

By that I mean that this screenplay was adapted from a graphic novel and by definition the violence and everything else about this film was over the top. Yet, there was no stretch to suspend my disbelief.The most powerful element of this film was that every frame I watched had me expecting something big or bad or awful or surprising to happen.

770,BoSoxMick,Thoughts,2,25 October 2005,"spoilers, don't read anymore...I was looking forward to a movie which had some emotion to it, some acting that had some chemistry to it, and maybe an ending which concluded with something profound. After the movie ended, I thought maybe there was a glitch, and the movie theater missed the '...3 months later' addition. Unfortunately, there was none. This movie had too many open ends. What did Joey do? What did he do for 3 years in the desert? How did he kill Joey? How did he not have violent acts that resulted in death prior to the two thugs coming to town? Is that town that free of punks? The high school had a punk, so there must've been adult punks, especially at a diner. In his 15 years or so at the diner, he never once had an unruly customer? Who may have had a gun? He never hit his kid before the killings? He only relapsed mentally then? Wasn't it weird that Tom & His wife re-enacted a cheerleader sex scene? Maybe she likes it rough? I wasn't looking for a Steven segal movie, I was looking for a movie which presented an idea, and it didn't. If deep messages are not caught by the general public, you have failed. The Matrix series apparently had deep messages, and lots of people missed it. In my opinion, if you think most people missed the point, the average viewer, I think you might just be upset that you put so much hype into it and it failed miserably. I enjoy Viggo and Ed Harris and love Maria Bello. I think the husband/wife chemistry was just never there. Maybe that was the point? I doubt it. 'YOU'RE NOT EVEN FROM PORTLAND!' probably put that 'relationship' in perspective. I think the problem was this movie lacked any depth whatsoever. The bully decided he hated the son because he caught a shallow fly ball during gym class? There was nothing else to suggest otherwise. Seemed like a fun side story, however I think people picked up on it as soon as the son caught the ball and saw the other kids reaction. 'oh jeez, he's the punk'. Was the daughter a mute? Deep thoughts: small town comforts? Sheriff implies they're safe with him at the end. Religion? I caught the 'see you in church' bit. Love? Conquers all, even if you lied about killing people and returned after wiping out your brother and his henchmen at his palace? Why didn't he just move in, would've capped it off nicely.Don't bash me, please, i've read enough of the movie loving messages. I understand and respect your opinions on the movie. I'm merely giving mine. Thanks. Peace and love among movies.",A History of Violence

The film used awkward moments of unnecessary sex and violence to distract the audience of the utter lack of a well thought out, interesting, or surprising plot. The movie simply did not flow.

I understand to suspend your disbelief when watching a movie, but at the same time, let's make the scenes at least a little believable. A guy in hiding is going to be surprised that mobsters show up when he hits the news? Or was that supposed to be suppressed? The mobsters stalk the guy they're going to kill anyway? A phone call is made to the house and he runs the whole way there in the same amount of time it takes the wife to get the shotgun and get downstairs, and the kids were home the whole time? About the only believable character in the entire movie was the sheriff. I'm a big fan of Ed Harris and Viggo, and they deserved better than this.

I can honestly say that they must have been watching a different movie, this film was 90 minutes of clichéd stereotypes and poor direction and the audience I watched this with almost universally sighed with relief when it was all over.The interesting part of the story was almost over before it began, with a couple of killers on the run arriving in ""smallsville USA"" attempting to rob a café owned by Tom who proceeds to kill them both in self defence. The film then descends into a ridiculous and tedious plot about who Tom really is and why he seems able to be able ""to kill so easily"". I never liked Mortensen in the Lord of the Rings, and his subsequent roles have provided little evidence of any talent. He plods his way through this one, initially struggling to understand who he is and then suddenly remembering when Fogarty has a gun pointed at his head. Billed as a thriller, this film was one of the most predictable and boring movies I have seen in a long time with only a few brief moments of gore and sex to distinguish it from a low budget TV drama.

776,j-lindie,A History of atrocious film making,1,7 October 2005,"I cannot believe that people who have actually gone to watch this movie and are leaving positive reviews are actually leading their lives without the aid of a white stick and Labrador! It is easily one of the worst films I have ever seen and an example of actors taking an easy pay cheque.I'm all for scenes of nudity within movies (hell I'll pay extra), but the completely inappropriate use of such scenes in this movie left me squirming. In one particular scene, the wife of Tom Stalls, after finding out he was actually a gangster in a previous life, tries to push him away. This results in the ""real"" Tom Stalls/Joey Cusack emerging, who violently pins her down before she consents to having ""rough"" sex with him. What the hell was this movie trying to say at this stage? That women really harbour after bad boys??? Others may argue that the movie was showing deep psychological tensions between the couple. Boll**ks!!! In fact it couldn't be more boll**ks if it was wrapped in hairy skin and hanging from the back of a bull! It was just a crass attempt to inject some sexual interest into a horribly stale script.If this was all that was wrong with the movie you may partially overlook it, but sadly no, it manages to sink to even worse depths. The climactic scene where Tom Stalls faces off to his brother defies the laws of crap, by producing new levels of crap reference points. How we are supposed to suspend our disbelief (trademark Basic Instinct - possibly the last time I felt this angry about a movie!) to believe that a professional gangster can miss shooting someone five times from 4 foot is beyond me.The best gauge I can give you of how poor this movie was is that of a fairly full audience at my particular screening, there were howls of laughter at the poor acting in seemingly dramatic and gripping moments of the film. At first this annoyed me as i really wanted to give the film a chance, but as the film progressed I couldn't help but join in. As the film faded to black at the end and the credits began to roll, there was a deep intake of breath by the whole audience before universal laughter and derision. People were re-acting their favourite poor scenes in the lobby after as a homage to the level of crap it reached! I have never actually left a comment on a movie before, as I'm a strong believer in making your own mind up, but I'm strongly considering leaving my job and mounting a one man campaign to dissuade people from spending their hard earned cash on this pile of poo!

There is a menacing tone set in the beginning which is only relieved at the end. It was a similar experience to seeing Sam Peckinpah's, ""Straw Dogs"" in the theater. An unnerving threat begins and continues. However this was somehow quieter and more elegant. The camera work subtly makes you claustrophobic and keeps you on edge. The philosophical questions raised are varied and rich. I highly recommend this film as a theater rather than a DVD experience.

I really didn't care about any of the characters and the Howard Shore score was a little too ""hobbity"" for my liking.This film makes you feel like a voyeur because you cant connect with it, leaving you ample time to reflect on its dull and disappointing plot and acting as well as a misplaced score.

780,ianhowellevans,Deeply brilliant,10,6 October 2005,"Given the nature of Cronenberg's latest movie, I'll have to be quite vague in order to give any kind of commentary on the film's themes and ideas, but please bear with it. I'd rather deliver the kind of nebulous enthusiasm for this fantastic film that makes everyone want to see it, rather than a spoiler-heavy dissection that no-one reads.So. Yeah. Basically, it's brilliant. On one level, it's a terrifically exciting, emotional and original thriller. It follows genre conventions, and tears them apart from within. ON another, its an analysis of the way one act of violence infects a man's life like cancer, spreading through it and destroying everything that was good about it.The title itself refers not to the main character's history of violence, so much as the fact that the film is a history of violence (most likely in American cinema, I'm not sure you could map it on to America's history), charting it from its morally black and white origins, to more ambiguous situations, to voyeurism, complicity and the way that that role model debases the people that follow it.Like cinema audiences, characters are turned on by violence, but it's a hollow, degrading experience, the damage it inflicts represented physically. Other characters, who previously dealt with their issues with wit and intelligence resort to aggression and it's impossible not to realise the tragedy of this, the way they lose a part of themselves in the process.It's all extremely well delivered by a cast doing justice to substantial material. Viggo Mortensen does a marvellous job - one image of him stalking towards the camera with his face set in an unreadable leer is among the most terrifying images Cronenberg has ever given us.All told it's a marvellous critique of a history of violence in cinema and the hordes of people that pay good money to get off on it. Also, there's this great bit where this guy gets his face mashed off with a coffee pot and then his brains blown at and there's this close up of him face down choking in a puddle of his own blood and his jaw's all hanging out the side of his cheek.

782,noompa007,Some thoughts on A History of Violence,8,29 January 2006,"Cronenberg has matured as a director from the days when he made the cheap horror-flicks. He still relies on explicit, sometimes uncomfortable, visuals in his movies. AHoV for example, has its fair share of bloodshed. The movie begins well, with some interesting camera-work (the crane shot of the baseball field and some interesting perspectives on moving cars stand out). An early frame in the Stall residence( reminiscent of a similar shot in 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance') manages to encapsulate the entire family unit. As the film progresses, the changing dynamics of the family are reflected in the was in which family members are positioned on the screen. Howard Shore's musical score is strong as usual, something that is now expected of a composer of his caliber.The movie progresses smoothly through the first hour (it is a 96 minute movie). I will not bother going into the details of the plot, or the intricacies of the script. It suffices to say that Cronenberg draws on all his expertise in the horror genre, to create moments of heart-stopping tension. However, in my humble opinion, the movie seems to lose itself after a while. A fairly absurd scene in a Philadelphia crime-lord's house confirms a growing suspicion that Cronenberg wants at least part of the movie to cater to a mainstream audience. The movie does not capitalize on the solid foundation that it builds up over the course of the movie. Perhaps I was hunting for a drama that incorporates the fascinating family dynamics of the Stall household following a series of bizarre events. This is not an unreasonable expectation given the potential of the script. In particular, the mental turmoil of the son Jack begs for more attention. This movie could probably have been made a half hour longer with quality results. However, the movie scores highest in the acting department. Maria Bello could expect a 'Best Supporting Actress' nomination for her role. The role calls for a quality performance and Bello gives it her utmost. I expect that repeat viewings of AHoV will reveal deeper layers of Bello's character, enhancing her role. The star of the show is undoubtedly Viggo Mortensen though. Known mostly for his portrayal of the rugged Aragorn in the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy, Mortensen gives the performance of a lifetime. I was reminded of Tim Robbins' equally sensitive performance in 'Mystic River', another role where a lot of meaning was conveyed through minimal dialogue. Consider the much-hyped (justifiably so) stairwell scene in AHoV: Bello runs up the stairwell, disgusted by Mortensen, transforming the small-town, soft-spoken family man into a different person. Tom Stall becomes notorious killer Joey Cusack and chases his wife to the staircase, where he viciously grabs her, even pinning her to the wall by her neck. In an ever-escalating series of blows, we see Mortensen appear to rape Bello before she responds with a fiery passion of her own. In keeping with the violence of the scene, the two roll on the wooden stairs in a raunchy sexual embrace, with their passion expressed in a wave of violent energy. The scene ends in a remarkable way: Bello stands up while smoothing down her skirt, slaps Mortensen across the face and marches away. In what is possibly the most poignant shot of the film, Mortensen is captured vainly groping after her, transformed back to Tom Stall. The scene forms a sharp contrast to an earlier sex scene between the two when even their attempts at impish naughtiness elicit benign chuckles and smiles from the audience. In a perverse way, Bello seems to have a lot more passion for her husband after finding out about his violent past. I shall certainly study Cronenberg's genius in the direction of these two scenes. I was led to believe that Heath Ledger is a shoo-in for the 'Best Actor' award at the Oscars. Having watched Mortensen in AHoV, I think that the Academy has a slightly tougher job on its hands. At the very least, they owe both Mortensen and Bello nominations.",A History of Violence
783,forreal_finally,"Without a doubt, the worst movie I've ever seen!",1,5 October 2005,"OH MY GOODNESS! Make it stop. I went to see this movie with a friend of a friend, and for at least 10 minutes after the film had ended we both sat there in utter shock and disbelief. Could that really have been a 7.9 out of 10 Film, like IMDb has told me it was? NO WAY! This is such a disgrace for a great actor like Viggo to be seen in. To start this movie seemed interesting, the story seemed to escalate and only at the very end did I realize that it was all mis-leading you to think there is a climax.Why this movie sucks: Sex Scenes: I still don't understand the reason the 2 very graphic sex scenes were in this movie, I am certainly all for sex scenes when there's a point. I didn't see a point to either of them in this movie, people literally laughed when a very violent fighting scene turned into a STAIRS sex fest. Far too graphic for the 14A rating this received in Canada.Characters: Possibly this movies biggest flaw. Viggo's character has so little depth it was laughable, there was very little history given on his Johnny and there was no reasoning given for why he changed who he was, or how, or anything about his past really. You didn't even know him, yet the movie was supposed to make you feel for him? Then Johnny's brother comes into the picture, and he wants to kill Johnny because of what... Johnny made it hard for the brother to get into goods with some mob people? We also know nothing about him, and all he has to do is ask and Johnny just drives up to Philli with no more reason then, because. His character should have KNOWN what his brother was like and predicted it. None of this made sense to me, It all seemed so empty.Violence: I do NOT have a problem with violence in movies, I think a lot of times violence makes a movie have lot more impact (IE: Kill Bill, Four Brothers) but in this movie all the violence happened just so it would happen. There was no suspense, AT ALL. It just happens then its over, it was very boring, and very graphic.All in all, don't see this movie unless you your either 14, Stupid, or hate using more than 3 brain cells to watch a movie! HORRIBLE!",A History of Violence

If i sit in my seat and watch a movie, I have no reason to want to think about what the director is doing in this moment or the next. I want to be a part of the movie.

In fact, I believe he was credited with such.I don't know why I'm giving it a 3. Ed Harris was good. He's always good. He can take a horrible script and make it gold... when he is on screen.

785,killofquestion,A History of Violence is a stunningly intelligent picture.,10,16 October 2005,"David Cronenberg is a very accomplished director - what with ""The Fly"" (1986), ""Naked Lunch"", ""Scanners"", and of coarse ""Dead Ringers"" he has done a marvelous job directing numerous pictures with different subjects and genres. However all his films carry on thing through and that is emotional impact of events on the individuals depicted. ""A History"" once again follows through with that in images and feelings almost on par with ""Dead Ringers"". This is a study of violence, through an incident and how it's effects play on those affiliated with the committer. Viggo Mortenson turns in a tour-de-force performance as Tom Stall, without his acting abilities the film would fall under the weight of it's subject matter. The script is a wide, breathing, and alive, it conveys and allows every emotion to weave through it, without detouring from the main theme. Cronenberg's directing is as excellent as ever, and though some may argue this is his most ""main-stream"" film his style and presence is felt throughout. From the beginning lingering shot of the hotel room, you will be hooked and entranced throughout. The only negative thing available to be said would be that the son's (Ashton Holme's) acting is very stilted throughout and when he is set to deliver an emotional outcry, he falls slightly below expectation, especially amongst such well equipped and experienced actors as Maria Bello (Edie Stall). Howard Shore's score is very subdued, but it should be, and it elevates the ever encompassing dread and tension that is on full display through the film (aside from the beginning). All in all, I just must say great film.",A History of Violence

I do have plans of seeing this again. Bravo, Viggo, keep the good work.When you have a hard choice to make, how do you do it? Do you just stand there and do nothing, or do you make a stand? This is the choice that Tom must make. I believe that he makes the right one. You can't let people push you around, you have to do something. Even if it costs you your life.

787,lukebo,A 6 for technical style and riveting scenes,6,14 October 2005,"I read nothing but outrageously positive reviews of this movie prior to seeing it, so maybe I went in expecting way too much. I know nothing of Cronenburg, but I found myself strangely not liking the story much but admiring the way it was made. The scenes flowed well, the violence was extremely realistic, with images will stay with you long after the movie is over.The main issue for me is character continuity. Somehow we are supposed to believe that an extremely violent man can somehow turn on or off his violence as the situation arises. When he turns it off, no one, not even his wife, has any inclination that it could somehow exist. I'll bet it is hard to find anyone who is as passive as Tom in the first half of the movie, or as violent as him in the second half. Seeing those qualities in the same person is a little too much. The same can be said for his son. I like Mortensen, but at one point I wanted to scream, You know, whispering is not acting. As for his wife, first we are asked to believe that she in no way has seen his violent capabilities in 20 years of marriage (apparently he was too loose a cannon even for the mobsters) and then, when she finds out his true self, she is outwardly, afraid/disappointed/disgusted with him. But at another level she is powerless to resist the allure of his dangerous side (the stairway scene), but she hates herself for it. Well, she is a successful lawyer with no self esteem problems. Again, I couldn't buy it. The daughter was the only empathetic character in the family, but she really wasn't a factor in the movie.Ed Harris is superb as usual and his character totally consistent. His performance is worth the price of admission. The same can be said for William Hurt. But here is where we go so far over the top, we can't even tell which way is up anymore. Somehow Tom, a thug from Philly, who fights like he was trained by some Israeli special forces unit, can single handedly and without a weapon, confront multiple groups of armed mobsters, make quick work of them and incur only transitory injuries. And then at the end return to his preferred life as a struggling diner operator and family man. I couldn't make it mesh for me, but it contained enough startling and riveting scenes full of paradoxes, that I just had to think it over, long after the movie ended.",A History of Violence

Small town guy, Tom Stall, becomes a hero when he guns down mobsters in his café. Yet, one is suspicious about him, as are the goons who come looking for him and ask is wife to consider ""Why is your husband so good at killing people. It has some of the same resonance as Sam Peckinpaw's ""Straw Dogs."" Excellent performances from all cast members, especially Ashton Holmes and William Hurt.

No, period! The whole film is something like a ""Frankenstein"": events are not actual but it's not a comic, it's not epic... it's just a cliché and it ends to be a bit laughable.

790,yarbles-4,"""Strong brutal violence, graphic sexuality, nudity, language and some drug use""",1,2 April 2006,"""Strong brutal violence, graphic sexuality, nudity, language and some drug use"" -MPAA If you're David Cronenberg and your movie doesn't have a majority of the above elements it must be a failure, right? Well, this movie has all those elements and is a resounding success by Cronenberg standards. Fortunately however, not all movies are made with Cronenberg standards, and unfortunately, here are a few things this movie lacks, judged by normal standards: Good acting - The principle stars have trouble giving credible performances. The supporting cast is terrible, which is the true sign of bad directing. Good directing - Gratuitous sex, gratuitous gore, actors looking and feeling out of place. Yep, this is a Cronenberg movie! Good dialog - The actors had as much trouble swallowing this tripe as did I. Good pacing - This is essentially an action movie paced like an art film. Here, a half an hour of material is excruciatingly dragged out into two hours. Believable Story - If this was done as an action movie, I would give the story a pass based on the suspension of disbelief granted to all action movies; but since this was treated like an artsy drama, the story woefully lacks in credibility. Plot twists - I was patiently waiting for anything even remotely clever to come before the end, but alas, it didn't materialize.This material would have been much better off in the hands of an action movie director like John McTiernan and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger.Cronenberg, it seems, would be more in his element directing snuff films!",A History of Violence
791,eternal-sunshine-1,Dial A Cliché,3,30 September 2005,"As a long-standing fan of Cronenberg, I've been surprised at the enthusiasm this film seems to have generated. The dialogue is dull, the characterisation minimal and bar one or two powerful cinematic set pieces, for me, this extremely conventional film falls short of Cronenberg's usually high and idiosyncratic standards.Dealing in clichéd depictions of small town and urban life, there seems to be little genuine depth or plausibility. Additionally, there's a complete lack of tension throughout. At no point do we believe that Tom/Joey is in any real danger whatever precarious situation he finds himself in. Like The Dead Zone and The Fly (both far better films, in my opinion), A History Of Violence appears to be a way of Cronenberg making a 'studio' film in order for him to get enough finance for a more personal project (hopefully, something of the intensity and vision of a Dead Ringers or a Spider will follow).The two main ideas underpinning the film (the nature of identity, and the violence that lurks beneath mundane surfaces) have been better dealt with elsewhere in the likes of Music Box and Blue Velvet, Personally, I found the film unchallenging, trite and hugely disappointing.",A History of Violence
792,clubbenny,Worst I've seen since Battlefield Earth,1,4 October 2005,"I initially went into this movie with high hopes seeing the high rating and praises that everyone seemed to be writing. What I ended up seeing was an hour and a half movie that seemed like two and a half hours. It could have easily been cut down to one hour, but I'm sure I would still have been left with an empty feeling after a condensed version. In essence what I'm saying is that there is nothing there. The pacing was absolutely painful all the way through. At one point I thought my suffering was over when the Ed Harris mobster bad guy was knocked off, but that was wishful thinking. No, the story went on to show that Viggo's brother wanted to settle a score too. So I thought, ""well maybe this movie will redeem itself now."" Nope, another anti-climatic, slow-paced part of the story was nailed on. I'll tell everyone the overriding deep theme to this movie. You gotta eliminate all your enemies or they will keep coming to eliminate you, and sometimes you have to kill your brother or he'll kill you. You know, kinda like the Godfather but without all that skillful story telling, depth, interesting characters, memorable dialogue, truly interesting and complimentary subplots, and good acting. The lines didn't seem to have been polished at all. George Lucas would cringe at how corny some of these lines are. They may be alright to put into a graphic novel, but in movie you're gonna have to do better with your dialogue. I will say this about the graphic violence. Didn't bother me. After all, I did go see a movie called a History of Violence. The sex scenes? Borderline porno. All they accomplished was to add about 8 minutes to the movie run time. The acting? Again, I think even Lucas would shudder at the reading of lines. The Chrysler the mobsters were driving evoked more emotion out of me. A few other quick reasons why I disliked this movie: no suspension of disbelief, unsympathetic protagonist (if I'm gonna sit through an hour and a half movie, I want to care what happens to Viggo's character, I didn't, and that's why I would have been thrilled if it would have ended at Harris' death) - essentially a little bit of character development would have gone a long way. I know some people people seem to find much depth in this movie and will ostracize my opinion because I do not claim to the see depth. I'm sorry to say it's not there.

The parts looked perfect: cast, director, story...Viggo is great as Tom Stall, as is Maria (I'll show my privates in everything I'm in) Bello as his wife. The supporting cast is very solid as well. The dark veil of tension created is classic Cronenberg- and it works. The violence hits hard and the scenes are beautifully shot with simple, tasteful effects. As for the plot...SPOILER: Regarding the plot notion of killing the past in order to become free of it, this may work metaphorically, even spiritually, but literally? Within the context of this film, it was a major letdown. Some of Cronenberg's commentary on the DVD talked about subtlety and leaving questions unanswered, which is part of what makes his films so interesting. However the omissions were just too obvious, the subtlety was purely surface and the payoff was just too tidy.Just my opinion HD",A History of Violence
794,kyle-213,A History of WHAT!?,1,16 October 2005,"Don't buy into the hype. Anyone who explains this movie in esoteric terms does not understand the movie but wants to, and attempting to do so is just proving their own lack of comprehension in that their is nothing to comprehend. The movie goes nowhere and says nothing. I totally agree with one critic who wrote of director Cronenberg being unfamiliar with normalcy. Although part of this lies on writer Josh Olson but what else would you expect from someone whose last project dealt with killer insects? The truth of the matter is there have been no movies worthy of praise this year and critics and moviegoers alike are scurrying to find a winner...but this is not it. The most appalling aspect of wasting $8.25 on this movie was the main character stood for nothing. I was so outraged by the review on IMDb by someone saying that ""A History of Violence,"" is a great character study that I felt compelled to write this critique. It is anything but a character study. The main character Tom Stall never revealed anything about himself. With no development it is hard to have any feelings towards Stall or any respect for the movie. Also worthy of mentioning is the director's lack of self control. At times he could not help himself from being an a$$. For no apparent reason he pushes cheese down America's throats as if he's employed by the state of Wisconsin. I didn't appreciate the cheese incidents whatsoever as I felt them to be undermining of the audience's intelligence. Instead of building a story to a crescendo deserving of such over-dramatic instances (ex: Stall finding peace in falling to his knees and dipping his head in a lake; remember totally irrelevant) he forces them because he's always wanted to do them as a filmmaker but has never found the opportunities. This movie is nothing short of sh*t. If you watch this and are of any enlightened bit of intelligence you will surely snicker at people praising this picture. It is embarrassingly bad and will hopefully stifle Cronenberg's career here in the states. But for some reason I don't think it will because 8 out of 10 moviegoers are morons. In the end ""A History of Violence"" offers nothing. For a movie to have access to Ed Harris' talents and let them go to waste you know you're in for something bad. The lack of depth in this picture has not been witnessed by mass audiences since the release of ""Just Like Heaven,"" a week earlier. So what is ""A History of Violence,"" who knows and who gives two sh*ts. Much love, an angry filmmaker",A History of Violence

The rest of the movie was pure misery to sit through. Here's the problem (or the many):1. Terrible Editing. Painfully long scenes. Editing makes or breaks the movie. In this case, it broke in half.2. Terrible Acting. Viggo did fine, but the rest was very contrived, and borderline B-movie3. Organized Mob? Since when the the Philly mob cease to have Italian Americans? Ed Harris? He looked like he was from a comics movie, like Batman, with his over-the-top fake eye.4. Very disjointed. Long boring parts, with sudden and extreme violence. The violence just didn't seem to fit.5. No chemistry between Mr. & Mrs. Ex-Mob-Killer. Even the sex scenes were awkward, and just plain unbelievable. The first one was weird. They portray the couple as SO loving, and then all of a sudden it's kinky sex with a 69 scene. Where did that come from? 69? Just bizarre.6. I think Daimler-Chrystler funded this movie, with all the blatant 300C commercials throughout.7. It's a happy family, seemingly. Everything is perfect.

The upside of the plot is that it seems to thankfully resist a few painful norms, our hero, never truly takes joy in killing, he never really ""returns to his lifestyle, never having truly turned from his past"" as one might dread in such a movie, and there were no delays, or teasers or setbacks in the process of getting to see a sex scene, but both of them were tasteless in that they existed, while tastefully done.

From the beginning, which reminded me of Reservoir Dogs, to the end, which reminded me of no movie I've seen, the directing, the acting, and specifically the cinematography were stellar. The violence was gruesome and involving, but never gratuitous. I think the school butt-kicking scene made everyone feel happy and vindicated, judging from the crowd response in the small, sold-out theater. A note about the sex scenes: while these were not overly-graphic in the literal sense, they were extremely intimate. I think many people in the theater were uncomfortable. Not me. This movie pulls no punches, from the gut-wrenching murder of a small child in the beginning to the day of reckoning for Joey's brother at the end.

However, the dialog was so absurd the audience was laughing through half the film - laughing in embarrassment and not from joy. Performances by wife and son were unconvincing and poorly directed. William Hurt's performance also unconvincing and a tremendous disappointment. Cronenberg seemed to be attempting to create drama out of camera angles and musical score, but failed miserably due to the dialog and weak supporting performances. A better director would have strengthened the dialog and brought great improvement to the many poorly acted scenes, including both sex scenes, which were a complete joke.

800,AtriumLake,What was there that I didn't like about this film,1,3 October 2005,"This movie was almost worst. I was furious with the director/producer/screenwriter for shoveling out this stuff (stuff substituted for other words). I'm not talking about the violence, gore, or sex - which were all well-done but were visiting from a movie that a person might have enjoyed. I'm talking about the brainless intellectual treatment of the topic. This is getting raves for being a ""thinking"" movie about violence, action, thrills, suspense, or whatever you'd call it. But did the people responsible for this ever actually think about what they were doing.SPOILER MATERIAL: Let me just say that these folks haven't seen a cliché they didn't like (is that statement a cliché?). The story needs a couple of heartless thugs at the opening to serve as our hero's fodder - borrow them from Pulp Fiction. The bully at school is freakily like some character out of Breakfast Club. Do they know how far apart those two movies are? The customers at the diner are typecast simpletons, the high school kids are a punk girl, pretty-boy tough-boy stud, and a well-scrubbed all-American protagonist kid. And meanwhile how'd a 40 year old couple living in this farm town end up looking so damn fiercely sexy as Diane Lane - oops I mean Maria Bello - and Viggo? At the end of the movie, Viggo comes back from his Odyssey to Philly and his family is sitting around the kitchen table eating... MEATLOAF! Carrots! Mash potatoes! I wanted to barf - and not that barf that the wife does in the hospital room that made the audience laugh! What about when Viggo finishes his John-Wooish killing ballet at the Philly mansion at night - cut to the next morning and he's walking behind the mansion to the edge of the marshy water - where he throws the gun in... takes off his... SHIRT... and begins to wash the blood off in the cold water... Why??? What was he doing before? Why the hell didn't he wash it off in the mansion where he'd just killed everyone. A mirror could make sure he was really clean! And throwing the gun in the lake! I'm sorry does he want it to be easy for the FBI or police or someone to retrieve the gun and come find him... I know these sound like ranting complaints.. but this movie was phenomenally, evil-ly bad. People in the audience laughed multiple times. The fellow in front of me got up and left... i would have done the same except for my movie date.If you are going to make a movie that is exploring how the world really works, people really operate, and characters really feel - then put them in a real world. Who'd believe any of it?? I know the movie-makers thought they were being so provocative and incisive with messages and ideas - but they haven't a clue! Does David Cronenberg really even know anyone who is violent! He should think about making a movie about something he doesn't have experience with. That's called being a dilettante (I think?).Oh, And add the MUSICAL DIRECTOR to my list of those scorned! Can you say MERCILESS! I guess he had to keep up the awful drone to disguise the absence of plot from those last 10 people who'd mistakenly thought there was one.I need to stop and go do something more positive with. Let me end by saying some nice things. First is that I found William Hurt, Ed Harris, and the Sheriff (Sam?) all actually enjoyable.

The chemistry between Vigo and his family is absolutely horrendous!!!! I understand that the director was trying to convey a feeling of this family being torn apart, i.e., Tom and Edie's relationship. But when you have no foundation to begin with, what's to tear apart? You have to have chemistry in a movie to make it work, especially in this one. Throughout the movie i felt as if i WAS watching a movie and not part of the characters lives.There are so many plot holes to fancy I do not even know where to begin. But I assure you if I wanted to write a thesis on them, I could.I think I understand what this film was trying to convey, but it did a terrible job of conveying it through bad acting, a terrible plot, and pretty bad directing IMO.

Dialog between father and son? Duh, way off character. The ending? Yeah right. I sat through the movie to get to this? Wait for the DVD. Don't waste the cash on the movie unless you only want to see Maria Bello without clothes or Viggo's butt.",A History of Violence
805,theoscillator,Absolutely brilliant...Cronenberg's best!,10,22 October 2005,"*minor minor spoiler at end* I don't know what to say about this film to really express what it made me feel. Before seeing the movie , I had gotten mixed reviews from people. Some people hated it and even told me they wanted to walk out on it. Some people liked it but nobody really raved about it, not even my roommate who is a hardcore Cronenberg fan. I don't remember the last movie that I saw that affected me so much. I really haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I saw it. I go as far as to say it was the best Cronenberg movie I have ever seen, even toping Dead Ringers which I never thought was possible.At the core this is just a perfect examination of the human psyche. What makes us who we are and can we ever change our primal instincts? Mortensen and Harris were incredible but the 10 or so minutes of screen time by William Hurt at the end of the movie really stole the film for me as far as acting performances go.This is a rare film that can both be slow, methodical and thoughtfull and be ultra violent, gory and brutal at the same time. And the bottom line is that this is not your average Hollywood movie. Where Hollywood wants to give you something easy to digest, Cronenberg wants to give something that is difficult to look at and makes you want to vomit it back up.The last scene says it all. Cronenberg's take on the happy ending. Tom returns, nobody says a word but they welcome him back to his spot at the family dinner table as if nothing has changed but it will never be the same.",A History of Violence

807,wfieger,A piece of history in film making,10,27 October 2005,"Wow. This is definitely more than one could expect from 62 year old David Cronenberg! I sat in the theater and soon got involved into a kind of Tarantino-like action - only sort of different, more serious. The movie went on and soon the Tarantino quotations merged with manieric eye-catchers like Luc Besson likes to involve: Remarkable Persons and faces, crazy couture and accessories, things that catch your mind and eyes at the side of the action. Things of quietness you wouldn't expect from a Hollywood mainstream production. But this is only the show, the story itself is a classic tragedy form, pushed further in means of movie art. There has been Claude Chabrol and film noir, Tarantinos and Rodriguez' satiric latino action, Luc Bessons melancholic action dramas and now there is a new step: ""A history of violence"" marks the beginning of another refinement in expression. What you will see is good and bad, a man thrown in between who's at the mercy of fatality. Great and unique.",A History of Violence
808,crunchyfroggie,Unexpected dark comedy makes this film a winner,7,14 March 2006,"I attended the movie theatre not really knowing what to expect from ""A History of Violence"" (2005). I wasn't familiar with David Cronenberg's notoriously gory horror films, nor his status as ""Baron of Blood"". The film's premise is certainly not new: ""someone's out to get me but I don't know why"", and I wondered whether the film would stray into the old territory. Mistaken identity, amnesia, schizophrenia...The involvement of Viggo Mortensen (as Tom Stall), William Hurt and particularly Ed Harris appealed to me, and suggested that the film was more than just the usual Hollywood fare. Man, did I underestimate this film! I had one of the most rewarding movie-going experiences in recent memory - ""A History of Violence"" was excellent. The film covers an impressive range of genres: horror, thriller, crime, drama and even dark comedy. Bloody and unflinchingly violent, but unexpectedly funny (almost comical) in parts, the film had the entire lot of us (in the audience) gasping, groaning and laughing quite loudly. Never have I had such a communal experience while watching a film in a public (albeit small) cinema! It was remarkable.The film also manages to incorporate thematic elements (the culture of violence and its impact on people and communities) into the plot, thus satisfying viewers looking for a more ""brainy"" action-thriller. The high-school experiences of Tom's teenage son Jack (Ashton Holmes, who performs well) form a side-story that cleverly illuminates certain aspects of the film's themes.I was pleased to see Viggo Mortensen (who was in danger of forever being ""Aragorn"") play a convincing 'real-world' character, in a more weighty role than his (nevertheless likable) 'Eddie Boone' in ""28 Days"" (2000). Mortensen has the ability to convey so much in his facial expressions - a talent I wasn't aware of until now. Top performance from Ed Harris, who always impresses me with his ability to convincingly portray a wide range of characters, e.g. Richard Brown (The Hours, 2002), Parcher (A Beautiful Mind, 2001) and Christof (The Truman Show, 1998). Maria Bello was fantastic as Tom's wife Edie - a character with surprising depth and personality compared to the ""screaming woman"" common to so many films. William Hurt was great as Richie Cusack.10/10.",A History of Violence
809,lalwaniamyn,Wow....,6,2 April 2006,"I just watched this movie. Thank goodness it was a rental. This movie had an interesting angle and a good plot development, but then it just loses it after an hour. One eyed dude gets killed, Aragorn and his family is safe. What really throws me off is the sex scenes with no nudity, and then bam she's walking out of the bathroom a scene later butt naked. Why the sex on the stairs after such a violent way of getting there. They were fighting because she was so mad at Tom/Joey/Aragorn/whatever and hitting each other like crazy. It seems so unlikely such a close and happy family goes straight to ""F*ck you, Joey!"" and then she does him on the stairs. (Bare ass of Aragorn and all) It is a good plot development, but can pretty much be figured out in 80 minutes instead of 96 If there was like a beginning showing the life of Tom/Joey instead of the mystery of his past that is figured out 50 minutes in, this movie would have made more sense. Sex scenes are all great, but the second one just made very little sense and threw off the whole mood of the movie for me. 6 out of 10. Sorry Aragorn, better luck next time.

That would be more appealing to me and I think to a lot of other men. Instead I'm stuck with a butt shot, thanks a lot for nothing. Without the sex scenes, this movie could have been the best for me, but since I was stuck fast-forwarding through half the movie, I give it a 4.

Cliché and predictable, it's truly profound ""A History of Violence"" received such great reviews and an Oscar nomination. The bad guys in this movie are your archetypal bad guys who are after one of their own, who, apparently, had a change of identity, but not a change of heart. Ed Harris and his on-screen bad guy brethren act like they're acting like they're bad guys, doing what bad guys are supposed to do  act tough and kill people. Their performances are all totally unconvincing. From the beginning, I didn't buy a minute of it. But, since killing  even in self defense  in this small Indiana town can occur with little investigation from the ridiculously timid police, well, we have the makings of a farce here not worth your three bucks and 90 minutes, which could easily be spent on better, more entertaining movies.",A History of Violence

I was not let down in the least. I loved it. The look of the film as far as the house, the town, the restaurant gives the viewer the feeling of a small close knit community. Viggo again has great chemistry with his leading lady. I thought the plot ran smoothly, the characters examined thoroughly, and the acting superb. The young actor that plays Jack (Ashton Holmes )is excellent, I see big things in his future. The sex scenes were memorable, the violence though graphic was not gruesome nor too difficult to watch. William Hurt as always plays his role flawlessly. I would highly recommend this film.",A History of Violence
814,kay-johannsen,User Comment,9,8 February 2006,"A wonderful film. Only 96 minutes, but it seemed much longer. Quality more than quantity. The film gets to the point very quickly, which I find refreshing for a change.I appreciated the psychological aspects to the film, especially the son's (Jack's) surprising ability to fight and defend him self to such a competent degree. Where did he learn this? Is this his father's secretive and hidden ability to do this? I have heard that parents' unexpressed suppressed traits are often expressed through their children. Wasn't Tom suppressing his traits? All happening on a subliminal level of course. Has anyone else thought of this? I liked the possibility of forgiveness, which Tom's family gave him. I also think the Sheriff allowed the matter to slide  allowing a sleeping dog to lie so to speak. Also a type of forgiveness. All this forgiveness is given due to Tom's genuine and deep desire to leave his past behind him. I can only guess that Tom was forced into the violence he experienced in his past, therefore never his own choice. Something I would like to believe.I am pleased to read that Cronenberg cut the restaurant scene  glorified violence would have spoiled the film.I discovered two Goofs, which are not mentioned under Goofs on the film's page.1. After Tom Stall has raped his wife Edie on the staircase, he lies there with his jeans way down below his waist. When the camera zooms onto him his jeans are up around his waist. 2. After Tom Stall returns home after killing his brother, his daughter (Sarah) sets the table for her father. She places the knife and fork upside down and on the wrong sides of the plate. When the camera shows the plate, the cutlery is set correctly.",A History of Violence

817,miyazaki1980,Violence crossing life ...,8,5 April 2006,"History of Violence  touchy ! Violence and film have become too obviously related it seems. The standard recipe for an action movie, always seems to involve lots of blood, fighting and car-chases. Ironically, it has become quite accepted, as long as the violence shown doesn't fall into cruelty and outright unethical practices. In that respect, the movie seems to propose a kind of criticism that has seemed to be absent for a long time in American cinema. Strange, that even in times of republican ruling, when conservatives try to put their mark on society, there is nevertheless room for 'eye-openers' in the cultural sphere in scrutinizing the deficiencies of one's own society! Well then, is being self-criticism a sign of weakness then ? I don't think so. The film opens with two men who search their ways through the country, leaving a track of blood by killing people as they would go to the toilet. Without a single drip of remorse by the killers, people get shot and hit. Both grown ups as well as children become victim of this completely apathetic attitude. In this opening scenes, violence is becoming banalized. The characters of these scenes act as if no day exists without any violence. As if violence is an inevitable stretching of the muscles, day after day. The violence as depicted here doesn't contain any logic any more. Violence is like an eruption, without a clear definable reason. Violence becomes highly unpredictable and ultimately meaningless. It only deprives other people, its victims, of their meaningful lives. And that's the way violence has changes through history. But what happens when ordinary people don't take violence any more? What happens when the assumed 'weaker' of society respond to that actions in a lucid and ironic (even sarcastic) way? History of Violence. A 'small' man stands up for justice to be done during a hold-up in his coffee-shop. His son, a gay but clever young man, can be seen as a symbol of 'the weaker' who mocks the violence that is directed towards  his 'being'. He tries to reply violent homophobia by a non-violent and verbally skillful response in which he shows the meaninglessness of that phobia. In the end, both get trapped into the use of the fist, which they disdain so much. Scrutiny, was it? Reflection about the darker and sensitive sides of society wouldn't it? Violence attracts violence  and about where to stop it? Perhaps, by unveiling the hollowness of modern times  where people accumulate a whole record or a personal history of meaningless violence.See and judge for yourself.",A History of Violence

I'd say the first fifteen minutes is practical meaningless to the rest of the movie. You meet all these characters that have little to no relation with the rest of the movie, no plot(scenes with the same characters) develops until about the middle of the movie. And I assume to attract viewers the director put in a sex scene which had nothing to do with the plot-less movie. The hand to hand combat scenes are terrible. No contact punches, I hav'nt seen fight scenes that bad since early Jet Li movies. Loved the ending Viggo Mortensen single-handed, killed all the east coast mafia including his brother Steven Seagal style, how cool was that. Course why were his former mafia associates after him, who knows the director did'nt want you to know because he wanted to keep up his theme of about a thousand holes in the plot.

I think he was a good pick for the role, but that the character himself wasn't fleshed out enough. I never really felt like Tom Stall was any kind of real person.

Unlike Action movies which mostly glorify violence with a typical misogynistic, One Man; One riot mentality. History of violence is a train wreck covered up by ambiguity. Its sparse plot is covered up by poor understanding of psychological issues (Nature vs. nurture, etc) poor character development, and poor acting. The movie does not grace the audience with explanations for it's actions. Like a poorly done Mulholland drive, the movie alludes to a more artistic, lofty script, but reads/views like a poorly acted action movie. The characters are simple archetypal garbage as badly written as they are acted. The sex scenes remind you of a cheesy 70's movie with ""sex for sex sake"" rather than any romantic, amorous relationships. This movie does its best to capture a loving family; yet, acts more like a four people acting loving. If you want to watch the original story, watch A Long Kiss Goodnight.

David Cronenburg did nothing to enhance the writing/screenplay of this film and after all these years for only being known for The Fly, he's built little if no credit with my confidence in any talent he carries.

The day before i saw the movie, i picked up a copy of the graphic novel by John Wagner and Vincent Locke, and read it. It was EXCELLENT. I was excited to see the film, even more so after hearing that Cronenberg was directing. I was sure that he would do the comic justice, but boy did he f@#k it up. There were a few scenes that were out of the comic, but for the most part, all of the story material was new. The dialogue was like a barrage of rapid-fire clichés, and crappy delivery. The sex scenes were just plain creepy. The story didn't make much sense, and the ending was ridiculous (again, nothing like the book.) After seeing this film, I think it is time for Hollywood to STOP making movies based on comics. With the exception of Sin City, Ghost World, and American Splendor, every one of them has been pretty much crap. (League of Extraordinary Gentlemen anyone?) We will have to see how V for Vendetta turns out. I really don't think that film can express the same feelings and emotions that sequential art can. So i think they need to stop before they screw up another great piece of art. Don't waste your money on this movie. Instead I recommend stopping by your local book store and buying a copy of the graphic novel. It is a quick read, a fast paced, gritty, and intelligent story that you will finish in an hour, and at only $9.95, it is cheaper than going to the movies. (and you can skip the creepy *ss sex scenes between Maria Bello and Viggo Mortensen) Also be sure to check out the illustration of the twin towers near the end of the book.

I enjoy films, I enjoy Hollywood blockbusters, and I enjoy well made made-for-TV-movies. This was none of those things. It was a God-awful boring movie. Another reviewer thought that this was a wonderful character piece. I don't know how he could say that about this waste of celluloid. There is zero character development from any of the characters in the movie. Even when the main character's history is revealed, the audience is left completely unmoved, and unthinking, as this movie was so trite and contrived that it was insultingly mind-numbing. The dialog is awful, with terrible acting piled on top of it, and a pace so slow it would bore turtles, despite two very good sex scenes, and three action scenes that result in the deaths and injuries of well over ten people. If you're reading this before watching this movie, please save the hour and twenty minutes of your life that this will suck into a completely unfruitful void. Don't rent it, don't borrow it from a friend, and don't watch it on TV. It will amaze you that a movie featuring Vigo Mortensen, Ed Harris, and William Hurt could be this awful.

835,eschro-2,Appalling,1,18 April 2006,"This movie opened up with an intriguing scene, and I settled in for what appeared to be a descent movie. Suddenly, I felt spoon fed, on many accounts, particularly how lovingly perfect this family of four was, so unrealistic, so over the top, I get it already!! The writing was poor, the acting was poor. The soundtrack was atrocious, something from a bad 70's TV show. Then there was the teenage son with bully troubles, a scene straight out of an after school special. Ed Harris was a breath of fresh air, but William Hurt barely had a part - nothing much to say about that. Viggo was a flat line, and Maria (wife) was nice to look at, but again, nothing much there. What up with the gratuitous sex scenes - unnecessary. Some of the graphic violence was over the top as well. This movie had no thought provoking messages about violence in society, and most of the movie seem contrived and forced. The ending was awful too. Thank goodness it was under 2 hours.

It is hard to believe there is anything wrong, but we find out that is not true. It makes you wonder. Some hot scenes. Some a little graphic. But it turned out to be a great movie.

837,kpezzi,A Disappointment,3,20 April 2006,"I had heard positive reviews about this movie on NPR and had read several good things about the movie and its commentary on violence, family relationships, etc, etc, and I was expecting a movie that would be gripping, provocative, and intelligent.Sadly, this movie was horrible.The characters were unrealistic, both in their pre-Joey lives and then in their responses to the violence and betrayal that erupt after the shooting in Tom's diner. I found the sex more disgusting than the violence. The characters, setting, everything had an element of incongruity about them that had nothing to do with the incongruity that the director was attempting to develop. When Tom became Joey I barely noticed since Mortenson's original portrayal of Tom was so...undeveloped. I did not get drawn into the movie and I did not care what happened to any of the characters, except for the character played by Maria Bello. Ms. Bello did such an awful job of expressing any believable emotional responses that I was hoping she would be excised from the film by a stray bullet during a random act of (unshocking) violence. I was relieved when she got angry at her husband and stopped tenderly touching his face and gazing at him with that adoring, dog-like expression. This respite lasted until the final scene when I was treated to an extended, tear-soaked version of her look expressing a blatant range emotions. However, the scene with William Hurt was the worst. Ever. Horrible.My faith in NPR's judgment of modern culture is diminished. A much more provocative movie that did blow me away in the theater and made me think much more deeply about violence, lust, and escaping one's past was Sin City, also based on a graphic novel. Watch that instead.",A History of Violence

How mistaken can one person be. From the beginning every scene seemed to be up to 50% too long. The intro was of course elongated for the credits to be displayed and I appreciate that it was to convey the 'cold hearted' violent nature of the two men but please, it doesn't take that long to walk from the motel room to the car.The scenes of violence were at best good although the special effects looked very similar to the slapstick comedy of many 1980s 'video nasties' Very low budget.The film was completely obvious in the plot and over extended scenes in between violence were completely useless. I get the fact he was a family man with good small town ethics!!! I also got the fact that it was meant to convey the massive change from Joey but I could have summed it up in about 10 minutes for the whole film.This at best should have been an short film in the 'my first effort at film making' category of some high schools prize day.How very disappointing.",A History of Violence
839,alysheba1,Terrible,1,24 April 2006,"This movie was horrendous. It started off as though it might be interesting but the story and acting absolutely sucked! I laugh at how really bad this movie was. It was extremely predictable and the plot (what there was of one) was a joke. There is no deep thought in this movie, just bad acting and bad storytelling. I just have to ask a few questions for those supporters: The cop stops the lame mobsters and tells them to leave town; they don't, everyone still sees the bad guys, the cop doesn't come back into the movie until the end, what happened to his threat? Vito sees the boring, non-scary bad guys outside of his diner and just knows they are going to his house to kill his family. He calls his wife, she frantically gets the gun and runs through the house to lock the doors. He runs all the way home to his house in the country and runs right through the front door (couldn't he borrow a car, did he think he could run out to country faster than the weak mobsters car would drive?). The wife isn't looking out a window to see what's happening and how did Vito just run through the front door if she just locked them all? To top it off, her son is just sitting there eating cereal. Um, wasn't the mother frantic, was the son just a deaf, blind mute to not see something was happening? The boy has a tiff with the school bully because he caught a lazy fly ball in a gym softball game? Um, a lazy fly ball is not a homerun, a bit of a stupid overreaction by the bully I'd say. And the kid beating up the bully was moronic too.How the hell didn't Vito's brother kill him? That was stupid. Vito is running around a room yet no one can seem to shoot him. And Vito's stupid brother just walks out his front door to be shot by Vito who isn't hiding just standing there, yeah a very suspenseful ending there. Richie was a puss.The sex scenes were stupid. I always need to see at least one gratuitous 69 scene per movie and the sex on the stairs was a joke. Where were the kids (surely out since some weak bad guys wanted to kill them)? Why did the wife let him have sex and then wouldn't talk to him anymore? Did he rape her or was this consensual? I thought Vito's truck wasn't running yet he drove it to Philly. He couldn't drive it to work but he can drive it to Philly? He must have had a lot of time to fix it when some weak boring bad guys wanted to kill him.Do the original murderers just kill for no reason (a cleaning lady, yeah she is probably a threat to their big plans)? I thought they needed money, why were they going to rape the lady? I also think everyone believed they meant business before he had to say they meant business. Stupid.Seemed like a big shopping mall for a little town. Does everyone in the entire family always get up when the little girl had a nightmare? Etc.There were so many idiotic things about this movie that I can't believe everyone doesn't see it as a big ZERO. I've seen some bad movies but this one is right there. I can't help but to believe that if you liked this movie, you actually watched something else and mistook it for this movie. BAD, BAD, BAD.",A History of Violence

843,valueengineer,Promising title and cast but disappointing earnings,6,9 May 2006,"I am really disappointed with ""The History of Violence"". Tom Stahl is a diner owner who is attacked by vicious thugs. What happens next turns his life upside down and forces him to put it back in order. The movie does have the makings of a classic and Vig is at his best. The dark scenes and the vicious characters bring forth elements of film noir (Fritz Lang's classic, ""The big chill"" and Chinatown comes to mind) and the violent movies of the '70's, but this is where the comparisons end. The characters in these films are suave whereas the characters in ""History"" are brutish in a ""Walking Tall,"" ""Mr. Majestyk"" sort of way. But ""History: is neither the '70's gangster type film nor film noir. In these films the characters and plot lines are strong and rich. There is also a good supporting cast. These movies are also intensely absorbing (good editing). The plot in History is on the shallow side and is quickly revealed in the early part of the movie. None of the supporting cast except Maria is convincing. Ed Harris is uncomfortable in this role. Jack Stahl, the son looks as if he is always ready to cry. Portrayal of his life is abrupt as are the scene transitions. The love scenes are clinical. I am also disappointed that the big names in the film have the smaller roles.

Where the hell did they get the rest of these actors? And the dialogue in the movie is as stiff as a board. It had potential to be a blockbuster. If only they would have spent more money and got some real actors in there. Viggo Mortenson's role was very painful to watch. For such an acclaimed actor (The Lord of the motherf*ckin Rings) he fails to impress and quite often does such a bad job of conveying emotion properly in this movie that it makes me want to throw up all over myself.

The opening scene sucked. Right away I was skeptical, but having wanted to see the movie for so long I decided to stick with it. What a poor decision. If what makes a movie good for you is the acting, the writing and the presentation, then stay away from this movie. I really dig Vigo and Ed but was entirely shocked by their acting, vapid to say the LEAST. I'm not gonna knock on the story, because I believe a great movie could've been made from it.

As my wife and I sat watching the only that hit us was how awful this film was. And we certainly talked afterwards, but we were mostly wondering if we had watched the same movie as the critics.The thing that hit me most was how paper-thin all of the characters were. This is supported mostly by terrible dialogue throughout. I found that I simply couldn't relate to any of the main protagonists and at times their behaviour on-screen made me laugh out loud because I was so dumb-founded at what I was seeing. The only character that I felt was even slightly well portrayed was the mysterious gangster played by Ed Harris.The other major problem I found with this movie is that the plot devices were absolutely ridiculous. One shining example is the high-school bullying that occurs between one of the main characters, Jack, and another kid. But what did Jack do to earn his misfortune? Did he steal the other kids girl? Did he wreck his car? No. He caught a baseball. This is played out throughout the whole movie and is so contrived that I found my mouth hanging open in astonishment whenever there was a scene focusing on this tension.The end result for me is that this is easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

The storyline is interesting and Viggo Mortensen's performance is good, but there are many scenes that made what could have been a cool flick into a campy one. Three scenes in particular that turn it from being an engaging film to a laughable one are the following: 1. The beginning is unnecessarily slow in that it mutes the shock value of what's happening. One tends to be glad after the gas station massacre in hopes that the story will speed up. 2. The scene of Joey and Edie on the stairs is not only pathetically stupid but unrealistic with no real point in the movie other then being a fantasy for male audiences. Note: There is a difference between role playing as seen earlier in the movie and rape. Then Edie walks around with an open bathrobe, yeah right guys. 3. Jack's high school brawl implies a violent bloodline that isn't cultivated. This scene would have made much more sense if it occurred after he witnessed Joey's actions with the front yard incident.All in all, this movie is a disappointment because it had such possibilities.

We see how an average Joe turns out to be someone who handles violence very well. During the film we learn why that is. I don't know what David Cronenberg wanted to say exactly with this film but in my book it could have shown the ultimate consequence of when you choose to answer violence with violence. In the typical Hollywood blockbuster we always see the hero solving problems with violence and getting away with it. In real life however we always have to answer to someone when we do that, be it the authorities or the party you use the violence against. Therefore for me the perfect ending would have been if William Hurt's character would have killed his brother, showing that when you resort to violence, somewhere along the line it will come back to you with a vengeance",A History of Violence
853,joene123,The balance is gone.,5,24 May 2008,"When I was about to watch A history of violence, I expected a tragedy about a guy who accidentally murders another guy and then gets into drama and tension and fights with his family. I had only read a brief outline. Luckily, the movie wasn't like that at all. The alternative, however, wasn't much better. All right, the fighting scenes were enjoyable, but reminded me more of a video game like Hit-man than of a great action movie like Die Hard. Fair enough, this movie wasn't intended to be an action picture. It was intended to become a thought-through thriller, full of surprise and awe. What I missed, was the surprise. The moment Tom shot those guys in the diner, I knew he wasn't Tom Stalls. He was either an ex-secret agent or an ex-criminal, with or without amnesia. I just had to figure those things out, but the major plot was already revealed completely. About the thinking this movie should set you to: I had a few thoughts about violence, how it is inevitable and how it can destroy your life, even though you use it for a good cause, but I had those thoughts reading the above mentioned brief plot outline. This movie didn't make me look on violence differently, it didn't even make me reconsider my ideas about such a thing. Pity.True, the acting was good, Viggo and his son have nothing to be ashamed of. But the idea behind A history of violence didn't need this abuse.

855,esigward,Tension between the new life and the old one,8,10 July 2006,"He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is the Word of God (Rev. 19:13).I wonder if anyone else noticed the Christian symbolism in this movie. To start from the end and move backwards, the last lines of the movie are: William Hurt: ""Jesus, Joey."" (Blam, William Hurt is shot dead.) Viggo Mortenson: (With a different affirmation in his voice and sad resignation) ""Jesus, Richie."" (As though to say, Hurt does not understand the words, but Mortenson does).It takes a bit of concentration to realize that these are the last spoken words of the movie, because there is subsequent action but no further words. After the above scene, Joey walks down to the water, kneels over it and washes or baptizes himself. A silver cross is displayed on a chain around his neck. Then he goes home to his family at dinner. After a silent moment, he looks at his wife and the movie ends.I could not help thinking that, like Jesus in Revelation, ""His clothes are dipped in blood."" While he kills, his killings are all righteous retributions, which gives them an odd feeling of being joyous and messianically tragic at the same time. I liked this nuancing of the emotions delivered by the film, which was different from other violent movies I have seen. The hero is not ""cool"" about killing, and his killings bring him trials of a different kind from other movies. He is stretched in his faith that his new life can be lived at all.Now let's go back to the beginning. Joey is now a new man with a new name. He goes to church. He has a wife and two children. He avers that he hardly remembers his old man, that he is living as a new man.The perplexity and interest of the movie lies in how he will deal with his old sin nature and life, and how people around him will regard his conversion and his exceptional gifts as a killer. The church acquaintance who is also marshal in town accepts him as a Christian but is miffed by his remarkable sin life. Yet, neither he nor the wife will judge him. They accept him as a new man but with a real history. In fact, the great love scene on the stairs of the house is a kind of exorcism of the devil and the old life and an affirmation of his total manhood with all its history. It culminates with his wife saying, ""God."" On the other hand, his mobster acquaintances do not believe his conversion is real and repeatedly test him because they cannot see through their own idiom of unbelief when accosting him. Hence, he reveals to them his original gifts but backed by new sensoria and motivations. It is only faith in Jesus Christ that made him a new man that saves him from mere self-righteousness. Likewise, this faith makes it feasible that he can actually escape the world, the flesh and the devil without some ridiculous idealism. He is welcomed into a new community. In fact, it would have been marvelous to find another ex-killer in the community who befriends him and understands what he is going through.If this movie did not have this peculiarly religious symbolism, it would only be a tiresome cliché in the line of fast guns who are reluctant to draw -- like Shane. However, this hero is not motivated by a politically correct liberalisn, like Shane, but by how he will live as a new man with a peculiar gift for violence. Hence, the title is a good one, ""A History of Violence"" refers to his own history. One should consider that there are really two phases to his history. The first is violence for the mob, the second is violence for God.While it is definitely hard to portray a righteous killing, this movie accomplishes it by the unwavering faith of the hero that he is definitely killing from within his new idiom and not the old one. Thus, his killings resemble Christ's in Revelation--he is an unbeatable master of the battle field, yet he suffers by identification with fallen humanity. He loves his son, though he sees in his son the repetition of his own violence. He loves his wife yet sorrows over the pain he is causing her by virtue of his old life. He loves the brother he kills because there is no way he can return to the mob world. The return to home at the end is a ""Christus Victor"" scene. He is drenched with blood for having trampled out the grapes of wrath. It requires humble faith to see why.I won't belabor the point further. I enjoyed the movie, and would give it a 10, but I thought it was dark and murky about this symbolism. It is , after all, very difficult for a man to imitate Christ. It is holy ground where mere man must be careful how he treads. Joey is a saved sinner, he is not the Messiah Himself; and the movie does not portray the difference between the hero and the hero's Savior. But, hey, when have you ever seen the gospel presented in a movie. I enjoyed this movie because it really went where few scripts will go at all, into the complexity of an adult Christian life where a man seeks to please God and live in a real world at the same time.P.S. ""he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel."" Genesis 3:15. For the first killing, the evil mobster on the floor crawls towards Joey and stabs him in the foot, while Joey shoots him in the head. The camera shows the head, now flayed open at the jaw, literally crushed.",A History of Violence

They are both pretty shallow, as well as most of the characters in this movie. And those guys in the beginning of the movie. Who were they? Where were they going? I really do not understand why so many people find this movie to be so good. I think this movie is a complete waste of time. I would never watch it again.",A History of Violence
858,BJ Galler-Smith,Cronenberg hits a deep nerve brilliantly,10,29 September 2005,"I expected bloody senselessness and instead saw a film laden with the deepest human emotions. It was real. From youthful loving to hard violence, from simple innocent joys to the full depth of adult violence and sex, and ultimate redemption, this film has it all. Every piece of clothing and set, every camera angle and lighting propelled the story relentlessly. I was never bored, and never overwhelmed with overdone violence. Nothing was gratuitous. Viggo Mortensen proved he's one of the finest actors to come along in a long while. Maria Bello carries so much on her talented shoulders. With Mortensen she shines with alternately warming and heartbreaking truthfulness. Ed Harris was delightfully menacing, and William Hurt gave the liveliest and best performance I've seen from him.This movie is about truth and redemption. It's the best film I've seen in a very long time. Kudos to Cronenberg, Mortensen, Bello, and all the cast and crew for what was for me a nearly perfect movie.See it, then see it again. It's brilliant.",A History of Violence
859,alvaroduranm,Good story. Good movie.,9,3 August 2006,"Think this is a very good film. An interesting story, with progressively developed tension. Good acting and a clever rhythm. I can't ask more. I recognize I like violence movies like 'Natural Born Killers' or 'Goodfellas'. Maybe that's one reason for my 9, although not the only or even the more important one. Maybe some flaws in the screenplay, but not so annoying to spoil the whole movie. Vigo Mortessen does very well. Ed Harris is superb, as well as William Hurt. Maria Bello is great too. In contrast with other Cronemberg classic, there is not much weird stuff. Only some not ordinary injured faces and broken noses. Enough to find Cronemberg's signature, but not too much to spoil the movie.",A History of Violence
860,buck-aroo,I'm the 1% who didn't enjoy this film,3,23 April 2012,"Having not seen a trailer to this movie, I had no idea what to expect. This movie was recommended to be by a friend, and I don't have the heart to tell them how much I did not enjoy this movie. In future, I will take their recommendation with a grain of salt.As for the rest of the people recommending this movie, I cannot believe the amount of positive reviews there are! I feel like I missed something. Did you movie come with a box of happy pills to enhance your entertainment experience? *Some Spoilers Below*The acting was textbook cheese! However, I could move passed that, the acting isn't even close to what bothered me. And I agree with the one user review that mentioned how bad the little girl's acting was, but I guess they couldn't keep her out of the movie for that integral scene of her bad dream. If this was a family of robots, that scene would have been much more Oscar worthy than William Hurt's performance.I felt the two murderers in the beginning was built up a bit too much, just a lot of unnecessary detail I fixated on that had no relevance for later in the movie. When the character leaves his fingerprints everywhere on the crime scene, I just thought this was all going somewhere. To me, I just interpret this as filler. Ed Harris coming to town, that felt really over and done with quite quickly, my reaction was ""is that it? is it the end of the movie now?"". Sadly it wasn't because there was more crap to get through. William Hurt's storyline was just incredible uninteresting. Just a new jerk being introduce that would predictably be killed. The soundtrack for this movie, was incredibly terrible. I thought this movie was much older than it was. For me, some of the composition was repetitive and seemed out of place. There were times that it would have been more effective if there was no soundtrack and just dialogue. So much irrelevant material in this film just made me cringe. The son getting bullied, seemed pointless. And the ridiculous sex scenes! I get that they were trying to show this was a passionate couple, but really doing 69 and watching them do the things they do, to me that felt like it came out of nowhere.Now for the two sex scenes in the film we never see nudity, which I'm fine with. However, if you're going to have nudity in the film at least do it right. I was shocked with sudden surprise of the full frontal nude scene of Maria Bello coming out of the bathroom. Was that even relevant? Why make her naked now? Did they forget the nudity quota and had to throw in at least one full frontal nude shot. The film is cringing! I was bored for a lot of it that I ended up just passing out after it was finished. I would say skip it, but there seems to be a lot of people who loved the movie. So you may just be one of those people.",A History of Violence
861,protectmyballz,At least the Violence part was good.,4,23 September 2006,"Admittedly the ""Violence"" part was fantastic. I cringed every time someone got shot in the head and when Tom/Joey/Viggo Mortensen stepped on that dude's neck. The nose splattering repeated punches to that poor gangster's face was...well let's just say it was something. If I were to review this movie solely on violence, it would receive a 9/10. Sadly, there is more to this movie than that.The main story of this movie is: Tom a mild mannered man is confronted one night by two ""badmen"" that try to harm everyone in his peaceful diner. He kills them in an ""act of violence"" and then bad things happen. Gangsters come to his town and try to remind him of his horrible past. One of them named Carl Fogarty claims that Tom is not who he thinks he is. He claims that Tom is actually a man named Joey. A bad man. The gangsters continue to harass him until he ends up killing them. He reveals that he's not really Tom Stall, but is in fact Joey and blah blah blah. His family then starts to hate him for lying to them all that time. Staircase love making with his wife ensues. Tom/Joey/Viggo Mortensen then goes to find his brother Richie who tries to kill him for basically no reason and fails. Needless to say Tom kills Richie. Huh? He goes back home and the credits roll.It turns out the entire time Tom knew he was Joey. Why didn't he recognize Carl's face at all at the diner? He tried to gouged the guy's eye out with barb wire. You think you'd remember something like that? Why after saving his dad's life did Tom's son, Jack, just start to randomly hate him when he came back from the hospital for the second time? Earlier in the movie Tom just finishes explaining to Jack that ""You don't solve things by hitting people."" Then Jack says something that enrages Tom so he slaps Jack. Talk about being a hypocrite. There are so many faults to the story I'd have to retell the entire sequence of events to list all of them.The last scene of the movie was just plain horrible. Nevermind horrible, words can't even describe how useless and unresolved it was. Richie brings Tom into his mansion and spends 5 minutes explaining to him that he wants to kill him. He can't just say he wants to kill him though, he has to say a bunch of random disjointed stuff before hand. Why didn't he just shoot him in the head when he walked through the door? Tom beats up Richie's henchmen after they fail to kill him. He then shoots Richie in the head. Tom goes home to his family who are having dinner and have gone from hating him to being completely indifferent. They don't say anything as he sits down to eat and that's the end.Wo, Mario Bello (Tom's wife Edie) and Ashton Holmes (Tom's son Jack) were weak actors. Their performances were nothing. Nothing as in not being anything. They just didn't stand out. Neither did anyone for that matter. All of the characters were lame and boring.This movie was quite simply a waste of time and isn't worth yours. Anyone who likes this movie is entitled to their own opinion, no matter how bad it is. Don't see this movie and forget it ever existed. A well deserved 5/10.",A History of Violence
862,rwlake-81518,Poorly acted and terribly executed.,2,22 June 2020,"I was expecting great things from this movie, but I was truly shocked about how much I disliked it.The acting was sub par and the script seemed cheesy and predictable. The action scenes had zero suspense and lacked any sense of thrill. The premise of the film should have led to a quality final product, but it was not executed well due to horrible acting and laughably bad dialogue.Overall, this film is among the worst I've seen in about 5 years and I'm shocked it got any sort of Oscar recognition at all. Don't waste your time.",A History of Violence
863,alan-862,Unbelievable.,5,29 September 2006,"I've just seen this film and was disappointed. Let's start with the plot. Tom Small becomes a national hero after bumping off two hoods who walked into his café. He's across all the media, with reporters staked outside his house. Then, he kills another three villains in a shoot out on his doorstep. Following on what happened before, this would be a major, major story. Yet there isn't a sniff of any police/media interest, except for an extremely dumb sheriff who suspects he's not being told the truth. You don't say, sheriff! Our man then goes on to slay another four or five heavies in a country house, bringing his tally of victims to approaching a dozen. This would have been far-fetched in Zorro when I was a kid at Saturday morning pictures. Maria Bello, although very sexy and excellent in the role, looked too young to have a teenage son. I also feel the climax lacked a sense of, well climax. There wasn't for me a sense of showdown, and therefore the end of the movie took me by surprise.",A History of Violence
864,rayston-12261,Grossly overrated,3,17 January 2021,"So poor. Laughable acting from the supporting cast . Waited years to watch this only to be hugely disappointed. Has dated sooo badly.

865,paulstefano,What Happened to William Hurt?,3,4 December 2006,"This movie was great until...William Hurt showed up. Oh my God! Was his character supposed to be a joke? What was a dark and morose drama suddenly turned into a Simpsons episode. I guess he was supposed to be doing a South Philly Accent, but what came out was a cross between Jerry Lewis and Krusty the Clown. This literally ruined the movie for me. I started to ask myself if the director was taking a weird turn to take away from the violence the preceded, because Hurt, was truly comical. If this was the case, great, if not, William Hurt has completely forgotten how to act.As I mentioned the first hour of the movie was great. The acting was good. Viggo, was very believable, and I loved what he did to change his accent as his attitude started to change. Ed Harris, as always was superb, and Maria Bello did a good (if not completely fleshed out) job.",A History of Violence
866,michaelcurran26,A History Of Rubbish,4,4 December 2006,"Quite frankly, I'm pretty gutted that this movie wasn't better. Viggo was average and Cronenberg's direction was hugely inconsistent throughout. Right from the very slow and boring beginning through to the very slow, unrealistic and overplayed final scene, this movie was highly disappointing. The subplot which some have observed, parallels the main plot, was a bully story right out of a million other films. Bello does well despite all of the other shortcomings, Heidi Hayes for example as a completely unconvincing little girl. My main issue is that, whilst the main plot is enough to keep you watching, he could have done so much more with the story. So people commenting as if this movie has changed their lives really ought to watch Geena Davis and Sam L Jackson in The Long Kiss Goodnight. That movie isn't awesome either but it's a damn sight more watchable than this badly directed, badly written and badly acted waste of 96 minutes. With apologies to William Hurt who does his level best to rescue the film, but it's just too late by then.",A History of Violence
867,samsa00,exposes the dual side of Man,9,4 December 2006,"great film shows the true, dual side of all masculine beings...the family man and the brutal man.... very good but why did Cronenberg choose a 27 year old man to play a 17 year old high school kid???!! (the son). otherwise a great film very good movie excellent great acting. Why they chose a old man is beyond me I have no idea but its a great film showing the true nature of men, as loving beings on one side, but as feral, savage actors as well. the acting is generally good and it portrays the crisis of a family torn apart by secrets that cannot he kept for too long. William hurt finally sheds his dandy image and plays a goon quite well.",A History of Violence
868,writesmith,Logic might help,6,10 December 2006,"Here are some spoilers, both in giving away info and Cronenberg's lack of logic.When Viggo is stabbed in the foot, he shoots the attacker, then sits there , contemplating what has happened and what it might mean. He seems awfully calm and relaxed for having a blade sticking in his foot. I think most of us might have contemplated our navels after having addressed the extreme pain emanating from a pointed object in our body.Similarly, when Viggo realizes the bad guys are heading to his home, he runs home, on aforementioned injured foot which didn't bother him when a knife was in it, and calls his wife on the way. You mean this so popular man couldn't get immediate access to a car? Or call the sheriff first? No, running on his injured foot is his best option. (Yeah, I know there are no cabs in Indiana) As for the emotional believability of his son abhoring violence, then raging against his tormentor, for his two thirds of his family turning against him for saving their lives, that also strains credulity. Maria knows her husband has a secret past by the way he defends himself in the diner at the opening. I don't' remember her asking him about it. But she doesn't remember this after learning he does have a past? People only act this way when told to by bad screenwriters.",A History of Violence

It's too bad, the last 1/4 of the movie just sort of runs out of gas there's gigantic plot questions that are left unanswered and they try to dispatch with it in like a short dialog sentence and it doesn't satisfy. People keep taking about the sex. There's 2 scenes. The first one was pretty hot and pretty believable. The second one was suuuuuper cringy and just made very little sense and, I dunno, seemed more intended to titillate than to flow from the story naturally. And then the finale. It just didn't do it for me at all. Too much telling about the central question and not enough showing and then the movie just sort of...Ends. It was ok. I'd say it's a pretty good movie. If sex and violence offend you then maybe you want to think about watching this a little harder. It just seemed to have a lot more potential than it ever realizes. Let down.

870,stugee,a huge disappointment,3,18 December 2006,"I was really looking forward to seeing a History Of Violence. I'm a Cronenberg fan and generally enjoy the violent, creepy, edgy (don't like the term but you know what I mean) end of the DVD aisle that he inhabits. Add to this that I read the overwhelmingly positive reviews and was intrigued by the set up, and this movie turned out to be a huge disappointment.Fundamentally the problem is the script, most of the dialogue could have fallen from the deathless lips of Leslie Nielson or Charlie Sheen without editing  in this context it just sounded preposterous. I got no sense of any attempt at ironic distancing, the clunky dialogue just made me laugh, in between feeling annoyed and cheated that this great cast weren't being used for something better.The sex and violence was generally done pretty well, but mostly seemed kind of silly  along the lines of ""what's he going to do now, oh yeah, kill everybody"". The fans will probably say that this is the point of the film (Stall's tragic destiny)  but actually I think the point is, somewhere down the line you need to believe what you are seeing, or be engaged by something with some substance beyond the visual, and neither condition was met by this film. The big ideas which everybody is raving about actually seem pretty facile  yes violence is all pervasive and inescapable, yes, it is difficult to escape your past, yes, there is something interesting to be done with a movie about somebody attempting to escape their past (think Hal Hartley's vastly superior Amateur), its just this didn't get there.For the most part the cast did a good job with the material they were given. I have to say that Maria Bello always looked like she was consciously dressing down for the role, but it isn't her fault she looks that good. Frankly, I think it is clear the fault lies with the director.I see from the listing that the movie has evolved from a graphic novel and this may be the clue to two things, on the one hand why the too literal lifting of source material doesn't work as a film, and on the other why there are such numbers of ten star reviews here.",A History of Violence

But the music was creepy, so you knew something freaky was on the horizon. Within the first five minutes, you're like, this movie has issues.But Viggo Mortensen's character gets the bad guys, but good. Oh, man! It's the kind of violence you hope you can muster up if you're ever caught in an alley at night with nowhere to run. Inspiring, really. And the results of the bashings shown in close-up were great. I don't believe the movie was meant to be seen as a stand-up-and-cheer flick, but it serves the purpose. Plus, just based on the beatings alone, there's a good amount of comedy. Add William Hurt's character to the mix, and you've got real laughs. A point must be taken off for the sex on the stairs scene, which looked extremely uncomfortable, not to mention improbable.

I am astounded at the great reviews critics and people alike are giving this latest turkey from David Cronenberg; normally a successful esoteric auteur. The rave reviews are either from people who are deaf and blind, or they were paid off by producers who knew they just funded an enormous flop and they would be set on fire by the executives for even considering this crap. The swiss-cheese plot has a time line that makes no sense whatsoever, the characters are so transparent you could spit through them, and the dialogue is forced. The son's character and its subplot actually have no business being in the film at all; totally unnecessary. This is very Un-Cronenberg, totally laughable, and not to be taken seriously.

A completely non-existent plot, bad acting, shallow characters and pointless violence make this the Worst film to ever exist. The lack of plot is really obvious and what ever happened in Viggo Mortensen's characters past is never mentioned. The only idea that is ever mentioned is that he and Ed Harris are enemies for some reason. The idea that excessive violence and aggressive sex scenes that border rape are not justification for a movie. It takes a special kind of really terrible director to completely waste Viggo's and Ed's talent.

875,trking8,Worse than stinks,2,18 October 2005,"the biggest problem with the film was the lack of any credible plot. at first, the pacing and the cinematography establish a visually compelling film. however, even early on, it became apparent that they did not spend much on a script. the timing of events is terrible (e.g., without giving away details, the timing of the first violent scene, then cemented with the scene where Tom runs to the house). once this flaw became apparent, I couldn't help but watch the remainder of the film with a critical eye. the next element to fall was the dialog. it was hackneyed and intended to convey a depth that was nonexistent at best and, more often than not, laughable. this was evident by the fact that the audience laughed at lines that were (I think) intended to be dramatic. this movie makes me lose faith in the critic's community, which gave it fairly consistently good ratings. if you must go, watch it, do it with a critical eye and please post here.t p.s. william hurt was (unintentionally) comical",A History of Violence

Like, maybe Stall had multiple personality disorder or everything that was happening was some strange fantasy in his ""cookie cutter"" life. We really just find out in the end that he's a liar. Whoopdy do!!! The acting was sub-par and the characters were just unbelievable to me. What was up with the character that Ed Harris portrayed? Is it just me or do you think he tried a little too hard to be this bad guy, mafia dude? It was almost laughable. The high school bully was a joke too. Kids don't dress like that today even if it is small town America. I'll give History of Violence some points for the martial arts scenes.

Did he quit?? Watching this made me angrier than any of the characters in this movie.

What I saw couldn't be more opposite. In fact, the plot was deflated in the near beginning when the idea that Tom Stall was ex-gangster ""Joey"", presented by Sam the oh so friendly town sheriff. You weren't given a chance to be held in suspense! I appreciate moments that allow the movie-goer a chance to foreshadow future events, but it was all to easy to figure this movie out in the very beginning. I must admit that some of the more violent scenes were played out quite well, but they seemed to not mesh with the movie's idea.

There is nothing exciting about the film; it doesn't make you guess at what is going to happen next, its just a straight easy shot to the end. Throw in a few awkward scenes that don't fit with the mood and you have yourself one fine piece of whatever this is. Crap? I don't know if thats a strong enough word. The whole thing is lazy, predictable and pretentious. The very first scene spells it out in a simple manner: this is a cheesy, poorly acted film. It is clear that the audience is supposed to realize parallels between a few characters, but they are so obvious that they border on insulting.If you like self-indulgent crap, then you will probably like this film.

It was one of those movies that just crept into my 'majorly cool' category quite easily, and maybe a little unexpectedly.Overall, I found 'A History of Violence' to be quite excellent, enjoyable, and memorable. When describing it to a friend this morning, I said it was like Clint Eastwood's 'Unforgiven' - in that both films really have quite a simple storyline - there's no major brainpower needed to figure out what's going on. This sometimes turns me off a film, but in both these cases, it really worked for me. I think it says a lot for a film-maker to turn something so simple into such an effective film.It certainly doesn't move fast. Just like arriving in a small town where everyone walks slow, the service is a little slower, the cars drive slower etc, this movie just plods along at what I normally find to be a boring pace. But with this film I kept having this sense of expectation - ""Something is going to happen soon ... something that's going to be very interesting."" Needless to say, I wasn't let down. And I came to realise the non-action moments were actually really important in distinguishing the different aspects of Viggo Mortensen's character, and how his family react to him.I knew from the trailer that I would like this film. The story wasn't anything shockingly new (movies about people who return to a violent past have been done before: aforementioned 'Unforgiven', 'Long Kiss Goodnight', 'Bourne Identity' etc), but the small town, simple-life man idea kinda made me interested. Along with the fact that I've grown to like Cronenberg's films since discovering a bunch of movies I liked were all his (plus he had a cool cameo in 'Alias' for a few episodes ... gotta respect someone for wanting to be a part of such a cool show). The 95 minutes this film took to complete felt more like 2 hours. And it's definitely 2 hours I was happy to spend in a cinema. It has some quite brutally graphic violence (which I admit I kinda giggled at the gruesomeness of), some unexpectedly full-on sex scenes, all intermixed with (what I thought) was really great camera-work with a really dark & moody feel. It's more than likely going to end up in my DVD collection (as in, the DVD's that I purchase).Anyway, I was trying to write something here which reflected how I felt after watching the film, rather than go all 'movie-reviewer' on you. Hopefully this helps in some way determine whether you'll like the film as much as I did.",A History of Violence
881,bobt-16,"Could have been much, much better.",3,16 August 2007,"I add my two cents to the discussion just so Catpetal1 can sycophantically disagree with someone new.This film was recommended to me by someone whom I greatly respect, which is why I was shocked when I found it to be pretty awful. The story itself is fine. Who doesn't love a good secret identity thriller complete with mob tough guys, exploded heads and full frontal nudity?I'm not claiming to be a film expert or master movie genius. I did happen to go to design school and i'm currently a creative director. I mention this simply to show that I'm comfortable discussing visual design, story telling through imaging, continuity and pacing. It's what I do all day long.Some thoughts:The acting was not good. Very wooden and shallow. There was very little character development beyond the main premise of there's a bad guy acting like a good guy and how everyone reacts to that. Viggo really wasn't believable as either the good or bad guy. He had the same expression on his face while killing people, having sex, having dinner with his family, serving coffee. (No, that didn't illustrate that he was a sociopath or someone with a sordid past; just that he didn't know what to do with the role.) The rest of the family was weak as well. I just didn't buy them together as a family unit. How could you? You knew very little about them. We barely knew the wife was a lawyer. Was she from that town? The son got picked on, but did you really care about him beyond the fact that it's not nice to see anyone picked on? The daughter was just weird and super wooden puppet like. I just didn't care about any of them. Ed Harris was good in a pretty straightforward role...tough guy looking for revenge. Okay. fine. But nothing Earthshaking. William hurt was just weird. Since he had no background story, he could act any way he wanted and get away with it.The way the scenes were set up and shot made it feel like you were watching a play on stage. I felt removed from the actors and not involved in the action. There was something bizarre about it. Perhaps it was shot using the frames from the graphic novel and supposed to feel that way. Whatever it was, it felt stilted and too contrived. There was very little visual flow from scene to scene (I'm not talking about story continuity) and it felt clumsy and stuttering.I'm all for nice establishing shots that help the story along. I'll even gladly sit through some gratuitous footage if I'm riveted by the story. But like some previous reviewers mentioned, there were some scenes that did little to help the plot. The opening sequences of the two villains went on for way too long. The movie could have started with the robbery of the diner and we'd still get that they were really bad dudes. The first sex scene went on way too long as well. Did we really need to see it evolve into a 69? Sex for sex's sake. You can establish a loving relationship between husband and wife without boring us with their clothed, drawn out sexcapade (I'm no prude, either. Porn is fine by me.) The long ass drive to Philadelphia (thank God we were spared the return trip.) The scene in The Turf Club. The softball game. All pretty pointless (or too long). I understand that some plot points that need to be established. My point here is, it wasn't all bad, but there were some things that could have been edited and handled differently.Just an all around weird adaptation: Stilted dialog. Cliché at times (scene about daughter's nightmare. Small town sheriff role...his acting was pretty good, actually) What about sharing something beyond the barbed wire from Joey's past to pull us into his history...to involve us in the story a little more. To make us care about why the confrontation with his brother was so dramatic (okay, he cost him some money and time. Does that warrant death??) and then the end, where the daughter sets the table for Joey. And the son passes the pot roast. C'mon. It just didn't work for me.Okay go ahead.

Then the good guy has three confrontations with the menacing bad guys and wins them all, triumphing in the end against incredible odds because the bad guys always miss and the good guy hits everyone he shoots at. Familiar? A slight twist on the by-the-numbers plot is that the good guy has a violent history. Because of this, the first 15 minutes of the film are spent creating a Norman Rockwell family so that we're assured that he's really a good guy now. I kept looking for the fast forward button, but the theater didn't have one. I don't really see much character development other than a series of meaningful looks. Credit the actors with pulling that off reasonably well, but it really isn't character development because we never get a good look into the personalities. Did that look in the end mean she was going to stay with him? Who knows? I would have liked to have at least another five minutes at the end to find out something about these people, but after all this is a thriller, not a romance.I put a spoiler alert on this review because I ""give away"" the ending. But really, we expect it from the first reel. Over all, it held my attention, but there were no surprises.",A History of Violence
883,JacksonR22,This was a big disappointment,1,24 September 2005,"I was excited to see this movie and I (as well as pretty much everyone else in the theatre) left the movie laughing because it was so bad. It felt like it still needed to be edited, in some scenes the acting was very over done, I felt like it couldn't decide if it wanted to be a spoof of a serious movie. DO NOT waste your money on this movie. I am a movie lover it takes a lot for me not to like a movie but this may have been the worst movie I have ever seen. Some people might try to sell this movie saying it has ""deep characters"" and ""great directing"" but that is a joke. The basic plot is very interesting but the over the top acting and bad directing decisions ruined any chance of this being a good movie.",A History of Violence

He liked it a lot. I just hated it. To me movie has no action, no moral, no secret. The story is plain and predictable. I would say, the actors played well, but there were no scenes that could touch me. Movie is boring, static, and one of those...""is this a happy ending or you're happy that it ended?"" Apparently we had a good time making fun at the actors. Little Sarah looked like little monster (thanks to make up and light man). The son looked so ""gay"". And wife was just hilarious. Tom wasn't bad. Intimate scenes were inappropriate. And didn't help to create a feeling of family. In general, movie looked like a long promotion for weapons.

The plot wasn't very strong and the movie could have ended after an hour. It contained two very revealing sex scenes and a full frontal shot that was not needed. I did not need to see Viggo's butt, or him in her crotch area. It went on for way too long. This movie was sex and fighting. Someone referred to it as ""an old man's porno."" The effects with the blood were realistic and the fight scenes were good, but besides that I would not recommend anyone to spend any amount of money on it. This is coming from a younger person's perspective. I'm sure the older crowd thought it was brilliant.",A History of Violence

For example, at one point, when the bully/jock sees Jack at the post office and decides to beat him up, the audience had anticipation for what could've become a semi-climax of the film, where the Jack and the jock would face off in a fight. Yet after the intersection run-in with the two killers, the story line completely shifts away and leaves audiences hanging as to what happened to jack, and after wards, no visible harm exists on jack, which leads to the conclusion that the fight never took place, and that the jock simply drove away.also, the ending absolutely infuriated me! i watched the DVD version of this movie on my computer, and as Tom/Joey came home from Philly, there was only about 5-10 minutes left on the movie. this struck me as a surprise, because one would think a lot would happen, after he dealt with his dark past, and his wife and kids found out about this past as well. yet the story simply ends, without a single word spoken, with tom joining his family at the dinner table, and Edie seemingly praying.furthermore, the staircase-sex scene was absolutely pointless, and seem tacked on for the sole purpose of arousing the audience. The seemingly gentle tom has for the first time, roughed up Edie, and thrown her about the house. Edie seems infuriated and wants nothing but to get away, as tom dominates Edie, he seems to have a flash of sanity and begins to withdraw, yet Edie pulls his head back and they proceed to make out and they eventually have sex on the staircase. after a few moments, Edie takes one look at tom and shoves him away. does this make sense to anyone?",A History of Violence
887,tcraigc,Don't even rent it,1,1 October 2005,"Absolutely terrible film. Dialogue was canned, the devices were contrived and the characters were simply not all that compelling. Viggo Mortensen as the otherwise simple mid-western family man, Tom Stall, does a descent job with the script he was handed. Unfortunately, his contribution was all too often overshadowed by the atrocity that was Maria Bello's overly dramatic performance as his wife. Truly disappointing, as I really liked her simmering sex appeal in 1999's""Payback"" while Mortenesen conjures up a little of the psycho boy he expressed in ""A Perfect Murder"". Interestingly enough, the only scene that I found to be somewhat rewarding involved Stall's son, played by Ashton Holmes -the kid's pretty good for his age. Every other scene was either painfully predictable, doggedly slow or just plain violent. With that said, I have no problem with the use of violence in a film of this genre (the title obviously suggest its relative importance), but what I found truly offensive was that it was overly employed by director David Cronenberg to mask what appeared to be his lack of cinematic vision. If you do see it, and I'm sorry if you do, ponder this; would a cat named ""Cusack"" ever be in line to be the head of an Italian mob family like Richie claimed to have been?

The plot was predictable and went nowhere. The characters lacked any sort of depth and the acting itself was something you expected to see at a community theater. If I could've thought of anything else to do on a weeknight I would've walked out. I honestly can not think of enough bad things to say about this movie or one bright spot to try and point out. I'm a 25 year old heterosexual male and even I was a little disturbed by the oddness that made up these sex scenes.

890,comicology,Play Hard and Pay with your Life,7,30 May 2009,"It's a premonition that not all great graphic novels get their due recognition, when adopted into mainstream movies, a fact agreed among many comics fans. But the 2005 movie, for which the central plot was adapted from the History of Violence graphic novel, sure deserves mention in our HOV review post at Comicology.The Movie was directed by David Cronenberg, and had a mega star cast like Viggo Mortensen (as Tom/Joey), Maria Bello (seen recently in Mummy 3, as Eddie), Ed Harris (as Torrino, or Carl Fogarty in the Movie), and William Hurt (as Richie), with all contributing equally to the success of the movie.The Opening of the movie, with calmly looking duo, slowly moving past a Motel, leaving a blood trail , is sure to have caught the attention of all movie lovers. Especially considering that there was no background score for more than 5 minutes from the start during this scene enactment.More importantly Ed Harris's still and scary slow-paced acting (he was undoubtedly the perfect choice for graphic novel's Torrino's character), and Mortensen's renditions of a frightened man trying to save his present being haunted by his past. Bello's acting ably assists in bringing out the character of a worrying and supporting wife through his husband's struggle to take control of his sagging life.The scenes were Harris and his goons, stalk Mortensen's family were shot with a unique blend of suspense and thrill, which is sure to bring many a comic fan's dream of seeing a movie made out of a graphic novel with all its essence, maintained at the same level as the Original.Cronenberg was the right choice to direct this venture, as he has the speciality to make movies with themes ranging in the darker aspects of human emotions and behaviours (who can forget the Sci-Fi movie, The Fly), and the plot of HOV was literally his playground. Josh Olsen who adapted the Screenplay based on the Novel, also contributed to twists and scenario changes to make the movie interesting and packed for the 80 Minutes run-time, meaning it was meant to cut the past reciting witnessed in Chapter 2 of the Graphic Novel.",A History of Violence

The sex scene on the stairs, there were more laughs than I have ever heard from any comedy I have been too. Shortly followed by some pointless nudity, a great laugh had by all.

It isn't, it's very slow and I was embarrassed when all my friends asked why on earth I'd made them sit through it. It's a complete let down. There's some pointless and graphic love scenes, far too many long pauses and not enough action. I was fighting to stay awake towards the end. Nothing really interesting happens, it's predictable and not entertaining. Wish I'd opted for Four Brothers instead last night, that scored 6.9/10. I think it had the potential to be good, but it really does drag. They could have explored more into the character's past, or added a few other characters from the past for interest, but they didn't.

However, he seems to be past his prime banking upon his former self to sell this drivel, presently. There are infinite implausibilities, foremost...the final scene that eclipses all implausibilities that led up to it.There is no insight from a directorial perspective. There are, fortunately, some amazing performances that Cronenberg either hides behind or, needs to keep this movie going, whatsoever.To even accept directing a movie of this topic is an obligation to do it well, truthfully...at least. In that, lost cause. This is an issue necessitating some authority in its presentation. To wit, there is none. It loses itself within an insular view of a very real human concern.

The lives of Tom Stall and his wife were beautifully portrayed. Everything seemed normal in this rural town until two criminals come to town and attempt to stir things up. That's where this movie starts to fail. Where is the motive for the two villains? There is none. Tom saves his diner but brutally kills the two killers. Suddenly, Ed Harris shows up and tries to stir things up again. Tom runs back to his house to protect his family and forgets about truck. The group with Ed Harris comes to Tom (Joey's) house and tries to take him, but luckily the son decides to use the shotgun. Luckily, Ed Harris doesn't see him. Luckily, the shotgun spray does not hit his dad.Why is Tom's character revealed to be Joey half into the movie? The rest of the movie is just more violence and blood. People are saying how much character is in this movie, yet usually the story brings about the character. Since the story really had no realistic feel, the characters aren't able to have character!

I felt like I was the victim of an intricate joke. Eventually some claimed that I should read the graphic novel, so that's what I did.It was much better than the movie and eventually I got further than the scene I had given up on in the movie. When I had finished the book I wasn't really impressed but I could see how a movie could make it interesting, visually.So here I am, watching the rest of the movie and you know what? It's just as bad as the beginning, except now I know how badly they're messing up the source material. The story in the movie has nothing to do with the graphic novel by the same name which would be excusable to me as I don't really care about it, but they actually made it worse.I would love to hear what kind of crazy rationale they have for justifying calling this a good movie. I've been racking my brain trying to find some deeper meaning or generally anything that might have been over my head but I just can't find it.PS.

Did anyone else wonder if everyone in the movie was going to break out in a huge orgy? The mom kissed the sheriff and her sun full on the lips with her mouth open, that's nasty.The only scenes that were mostly decent were the scenes where Tom aka Joey killed off some people. I still don't understand how him and his wife ended up having sex in the stairwell when they were slapping each other and he was holding her neck. Personally I would have left him at that point.I also think the movie could have been great. If only they would have painted a good background for the characters and who ""Joey"" was, and why ""Joey"" decided to become ""Tom,"" and who Richie was.

Had I known that this film was extremely violent I probably wouldn't have gone.That said I am really happy that I saw this film. Best described as a thinking persons thriller it pulls you in and you experience the events along with the characters.Excellent performances by all. Mortensen was superb and Bello's performance topped hers in the cooler. I have always viewed Mortensen as a bit of a hunky lightweight but this role changed my mind. William Hurt gave a painful interpretation of a philly accent. Being from Philadelphia it was almost laughable.

899,shashankshekharpanda,A History of Violence,8,18 September 2012,"Tom Stall is an unassuming guy with no airs about him because he IS an unassuming guy with no reason to have any airs about him. He has a limp in the foot that compels him to walk lazily. He is otherwise healthy, of cheerful comportment and yet he has gravity enough not to indulge in 'levity' with no occasion to explain it. So he has a personable wife, an adolescent son whose violent exploits at school (only throws a fist when cornered) give him the only worry in his otherwise placid life. He lives in a quiet, small town, idyllic enough to pass for a page in a 5th grader's paint book. The air is fresh, people are folksy and civilized. He runs a little, cozy, warm cafeteria, serving coffee and tea to the customers who he knows by their first names and they know him with a familiarity that is as harmless as the 'grandfather clock', or probably more.Then, one day, two men, with very bad manners, walk through those doors into that café and start to lose it when told that the café is closed on being asked to served coffee. They pull out their magnums and shove it in the face of Mr. Nice Guy, Tom Stall or Viggo Mortensen and uproot the carefully manicured peace and quiet of the house.And, then, as the earthquake that gives no warning of its arrival, the volcano that erupts after being dormant for decades, Tom throws a jug- full of hot coffee into their face, jumps the counter and lands straight between them and snatches the gun of the weaker guy so fast, so damned fast that the index finger twitches to pull the trigger after the gun has been snatched. He shoots 'em both. Kills 'em.The excitement is consumed in a couple of days, but leaves a few questions behind, especially to his wife: How... how the hell did he do that? Disarm and kill two professional killers? What got into Tom Stall? Later more questions emerge. Why do two more men in black suit, white shirts and black shades walk in and one of them, a professional killer with many years of experience called Carl (Ed Harris) insists, even on being corrected, on calling Tom - ""Joey"", rounding his lips tastefully around that name? He has another question that seems to have intrigued him for a long time - ""How is ""Joey"" so good at killing people?"" And he doesn't mean just those two.",A History of Violence

901,heriot,A very complete portrayal of a violent change of identity,10,6 October 2005,"I have seen this film twice in one week. Having read a lot about the film before, I was first almost disappointed by the relative unoriginality of the plot line - man denies ever having worked as a mob hit-man, later on it turns out that he was a hit-man, but actively worked on obliterating all traces of this past. I enjoyed the second viewing a lot more, because I was then able to concentrate more on the questions whether you can change character so completely and how you would have to go about this. I gave the film an excellent rating after the second viewing, because I felt that the completeness of the portrayal was stunning. Scenes that seemed boring or banal on first viewing gained a significance in hindsight, all the almost embarrassing shyness and self-effacing qualities of the main character become more relevant when we see them as a conscious effort rather than as a natural tendency. This then ties in with the final conversation between Joey and his brother, where we feel that Joey does not really fully revert to type, he holds back, he is cool and detached, as Tom might be from this earlier life, which, paradoxically, might give him the strength and the coolness to overcome an almighty force of thugs. We see a conscious split personality at work, we see what happens to the wife and son once they find out and how they will have to feel that they now live with an actor rather than with a person. While there truly is nothing very original about the story, man denies being a spy/thug - turns out he is a spy/thug, etc., the film really deals with the consequences and ramifications in wonderful detail, very different from, e.g., A perfect murder or Dial M for Murder where the mere fact that this young woman has just killed someone seems not to affect her much, because she was justified in the act. In A History of Violence, the very fact that the act of violence committed does not affect Tom at all shows us that he has become so attuned to slipping into his mild mannered personality that it does not affect him as it would affect a person confronted with violence for the first time. The pleasure of having observed a real slice of life rather than any sweeping conclusions can be taken from this film.",A History of Violence

""You gonna whack me, dad?"" Honestly. Did they really think we'd believe a line like that? And the gratuitous sex scenes were beyond ridiculous. The acting is fine, but the plot just falls flat.

This had the opportunity to be excellent, even if somewhat familiar; in this case,you know the ending before the end of the opening scenes, and there isn't enough character development or incident to make it entertaining in any way once you know that.It should have started with suspense- was this man a skilled killer ? No suspense. No attempt to put in a red herring about why he was able to dispatch two hardened killers without breaking stride; no ""I was in the army..."" stuff. Immediately, up turns the man from the past, and there's no mystery left at all; a competent crew would have made a 2-2 1/2 hour film, with suspense, incident and characters who you could care about.Failure must be largely due to the script, it's a series of largely disjointed episodes, with none of them interesting enough to give the film any momentum at all.

904,way_homer,I would have walked out....,1,22 October 2005,"The only reason I didn't walk out on this flick was that I was with a bunch of people and it was a long walk home. I almost never walk out of movies. First of all, I think I'm pretty tolerant and open-minded, and secondly, when I spend almost 10 bucks, I expect to be entertained for at least two hours. But their comes a point when you realize the time you are wasting is more valuable than the money you spent. I'll tell you this much: by the middle of the movie, most of the people in the theater were laughing uncomfortably as stuff that was not meant to be funny.I wanted to like this movie. In fact, I was enjoying the beginning of the movie, thinking it had promise and that it was doing a good job of building suspense.However, there are far too many times when the movie does things that are over-the-top and flat out gratuitous. I know, I know, lots of movies do that and get raves for it. But this movie is not trying to be Kill Bill or The Big Lebowski--it takes itself FAR too seriously for that. And yet, most of the movie makes it impossible to take it seriously. I generally don't like when people pick apart movies for being unrealistic...isn't that what suspension of disbelief is about? But I think a movie sets the tone in its beginning as to the level of disbelief that is appropriate, so when a movie, like this one, starts introducing increasing stereotypical or outlandish characters and situations, its hard to take the movie seriously.I found out after seeing the movie that lots of people think its great. This is lost on me, but if you are considering going to see it, you have probably read many good reviews. Well, here are two succinct reasons why you should reconsider: --The violence is graphic and gratuitous: Granted, I know the word ""Violence"" is in the title, and its not like this movie is non-stop gore. But when it is violent, it is disgusting.--There is a sex scene that I guess is technically consensual sex, but it feels a lot like a rape scene to me.",A History of Violence
905,damn_lady,I was this - - - close to walking about.,2,24 October 2005,"Ugh, jeez. I have never been so terribly let down a movie that I was actually expecting to be good! I came to read these reviews after seeing Violence, and I am left to wonder if the world is insane, or just me. Sometimes, I can see how a movie can be good even if I personally don't enjoy it. In this case, it's just a bunch of clichés, poor acting, and weird, out of place scenes, topped off with a weak ending and odd morals.The first few minutes of the movie heralded disaster. About 4 lines in I leaned over and asked my partner ""do you think it'll be this cheesy the whole way through?"" - we shared a whispered laugh, expecting the movie to improve. Sadly, it didn't.Anyone who has seen the commercials for Violence already knows Stall used to be a criminal. So, what else is left? Weird family interactions? There wasn't much in this movie that indicated that Stall was the father of those children - in fact for much of the movie I though that they were Edie's children and Tom's step-children. Enter the clichéd little blond girl: this little girl, she is a terrible actress. Her lines were horrible anyway. Nothing she said or did is what a normal child would say or do in a similar situation. Enter the clichéd, smarter-than-bullies-and-tougher-too, big-city-dreams small-town pot-smoking boy: the teen-aged boy, Jack, was a good character. His bully conflict was cute, but seemed oddly out of place. The acting was quite good, but his lines were clichéd and often out of place (what's with him verbally attacking Tom Stall?). Enter the annoying, bony, emotionally unstable clichéd lawyer/power-wife: bleh, Maria, I am sorry, but you were just terribly irritating in this role. One moment she's sweet and kind and quiet, the next she's whiny and having a tantrum. One moment she's storming up to her room, the next she's having sex with her husband who she does, or doesn't, trust (I couldn't tell which). All through the movie she's answering other people's questions for them. And yeahhh, the cheerleader thing, how quaint. But really, if I wanted to see silly girls with dark tans hopping around and giggling, I'd go to a peep show. I went to see Violence because I was expecting quality, not just filler that is a poor attempt at shock value and nothing more. Enter the clichéd kind, soft, quiet husband with a mysterious past: ooh, booga booga. This plot has just been run into the ground! We knew coming into to the movie that he would was a former criminal. So why was the coffee shop scene (oops, Enter the clichéd teen-aged couple sharing a milkshake!) the only half-decent one of the movie? Enter the only GOOD character, Ed Harris: yes, when Harris was on the screen, this movie was watchable. Why, then, was he on for maybe 10 minutes in total? tsk tsk, David, I expected better. His lines, at times, were poor: ""How come your husband is so good at killing people?"" (at this point in the movie Tom had just killed the two clumsy cliché robbers) Anyway, you get my point. And what is up with the violence and sex? Show me a movie like Kill Bill, or Shallow Grave, or A Clockwork Orange... The sex and the violence belongs! It's good, yes, it adds to the WOWness of the movie. In Violence, there are these out-of-place, too-long or too-short scenes that make your pause, get out of your ""movie-watching zone"", turn to your partner and mouth ""huh?"".The end was odd, though admittedly by this time I was really close from walking out. The movie has the air of a feel-good, be-a-better-person type of movie, no? So why is the moral of the story: violence is good and cool, if you have a problem, violence will solve it! And if the problem returns, MORE violence will solve it! The more people you kill, the better your life will be!..Yeah... poor movie. Aside from all of that, I just couldn't get into it. I kept wondering what was going on, why it was going on, and where it was going. It didn't help that there were little goof-ups in the film - for instance, when the Sheriff (oh! Enter the cliché, small-time but good-hearted, get-to-the-bottom-of-things-but-too-trusting small-town sheriff) pulls over Ed Harris and his cronies (Enter the moronic, cliché, goons/cronies) and takes the license, and then doesn't give the license back; in fact is seems to disappear! I know now that this is a goof, but at the time I wondered what was going on.Aaaanyway, this was just a crappy movie. David, next time you want to make a movie this awful, please, spare me. Or put up some sort of disclaimed ""warning: this movie may kill brain cells and cause extreme boredom and frustration and is intended only for those who still think that shock value is shocking""",A History of Violence
906,kmsparham,Worst movie since Mikes Murder,1,1 October 2005,"Having read reviews on IMDb I invited my husband to preview this movie with me, and I may never live it down. The audience, which was substantial for the time of day, ended up in fits of laughter. The brutal violence and bad acting aside, the plot was so thin and unrealistic, and demeaning to family life and marriage. This is the first bad William Hurt movie that I have had the regret to witness. The predictability of the screenplay is more brutal than the violence, and desensitization aside, one wants only to kill oneself after viewing this abhorration. There is so much about this movie that makes it impossible to watch, and one waits for something redeeming and it never appears. Do not see this movie, total waste of time and money!",A History of Violence
907,MichaelBannon,"very good film, not a popcorn movie",8,4 June 2006,"I waited a long time to see this new effort from the master, DC, finally gave it a look one sunny Sunday afternoon, just me on the coach, expecting only good things, again its a DC film.The pace, sequencing, and acting was kinda haunting, and overall the film was chilling and effective. Some plot holes if you will, but VM, did such an understated role at times it was a pleasure to watch. And MB, was simply amazing.Now, the little girl, was a little girl what can you say, the son was good, at times annoying but, there was substance to his role and how he played it.William Hurt was bad, can't get past that. The sex on the stairwell, on the one hand it revealed a lot about the characters inner turmoil concerning their processing of the recent events. On the other hand, from the wife's pov, this guy your screwing on the steps in your home, is a former killer who deceived you for many years.The end of their sex romp on the stairwell overall made that moment plausible. their 1st sex scene was just brilliant, as it illustrated how they were trying to break the routine of married sex, and live a little-without actually cheating on each other-just screw your husband/wife in a fantasy situation---very good.The violence was right on! Nothing excessive but ultra real, thanks DC.All in all I could see a 7 out of 10 stars, but I felt it was 8 out of 10. There are problems, but the film is such a breath of fresh air, and DC's authorship is so obviously skillful, give everyone involved credit for doing a very good job.Skip the popcorn and sip some wine instead - enjoy the experience.",A History of Violence
908,apolk,A contrived attempt at a character study which fatally delves into a myriad of art-film clichés...,2,30 September 2005,"... While in films such as In the Bedroom, or Broken Flowers a slow pace is warranted respectiveley by insurmountable tension and suddle hilarity, within the context of A History of Violence it is clear within the first 20 minuted that the slow pace will have as much payoff as running 45 minutes on a treadmill. That is to say when you walk out of the theatre, all that remains is some slight aggravation at the directors self serving attempt at drama and intense sense of loss at the recollection of a once possessed 20 spot. There is no ironic twist, there is no hilarious happenstance. All the movigoer receives is a sound, heavy handed, Million Dollar Baby except worse- like bludgeoning with the directors clichéd attempt at a character study. The last scene is like Chinese water torture with the little girl of all people slowly and emotionally bringing Tom's plate to the table symbolizing a hesitant welcome. What is worse, the moviegoer is subjected to Mortensons horrible attempt at a Phillidelphia accent. His stiff, stoney characterization of Tom/Joey couldn't have been more dull. However the quality of the actors playing his children if possible was worse. This movie represents everything that is wrong with having an Oscar ""season"". The director constantly seems to be playing to critics, from Bello and Mortensons ironic sexual role playing transparently foreshadowing Mortensons eventual revelation to the , stated, painful, last scene's silent progression into the now vast collection of art film atrocities. This film somehow has a decent rating. Perhaps any time a director portrays gratuitous violence and something that appears ""deep"" the impulse is to simply praise. This will remain one of the worst films I have ever seen. I give it 2 stars because Maria Bello looks great in that cheerleading outfit.",A History of Violence
909,hlenbrdii,Worth watching twice,9,21 November 2005,"""I think I need to see it again - it's one of those that having got my expectations out of the way, I think I would appreciate it more the second time - it's certainly a film for the intellect, not for the heart."" That's what I noted in my journal after seeing this film. I don't know what I thought it was going to be, but I came away vaguely disappointed. I suppose it was because I found it totally unengaging - which I can only imagine must have been a ploy on the director's part - the 'apple-pie sweetness' when the family are introduced was so 'on the nose', it was distancing (in that it was so unbelievable) and prior to that, the violence of the 'Bad Men' was flagged up very obviously. It's only on the second viewing that I saw how very tightly structured this film is. The time is given as 96 mins, but cut out the credits and I'd reckon it to be 92-93 and incredibly spare  First and third acts at about 20 mins each, with the central 50 mins documenting how the hero's carefully constructed 'new life' falls apart through a random act of violence. There are shades of 'Shane' and 'Unforgiven' here as the hero is forced to take up the violent past he's laid to one side. It seems just about every major character is tested and shown to be capable of the violence of the title.Each of these events is signalled well in advance, but with the pace moving so sedately, excitement isn't generated, more a sense of the inexorable - violence WAS going to happen, and nothing came as a surprise. Now we know this - from the title if nothing else - but the results of violence, the realistic gore, is handled so clinically we might have been watching a medical slide-show - OK, it had the eewwww-factor, but that was just Cronenberg doing his trade-mark body-gore. This was initially what I found difficult; the director's seeming, determination to keep the audience as observers not sympathisers. The dialogue is, on most occasions, functional, and occasionally rather obvious. The acting is good - Viggo Mortenson shows his worth as a leading man, and I liked Maria Bello's performance - but couldn't they have found a 7 year old capable of emoting? I've seen better at our local youth theatre - and the son, Jack? Well he had some truly crap lines to say so I'll forgive him. Howard Shore's music was understated but so distinctly HS I kept expecting a pop-up for RotK to appear when the French horn themes started; and then again much of the narrative was played to silence or only diagetic sound.The film is structured as 'a world out of joint' in that the mid-point is the hero's nadir - Tom's second confrontation with violent men when he's forced to admit his past as a killer. From here on we know things are going to go badly for him. This culminates in the final scene that is beautifully handled while being designed to elicit the emotional pull the rest of the film avoids. No dialogue, subliminal music and a cut that brings an unanswered tension to the whole film. Cronenberg constructs an ambiguity here that opens a debate on the nature of redemption - the family's life was irrevocably changed. Where forgiveness might be a possibility, we might assume forgetting never would be.If you can, schedule a second viewing of this one  it's worth it.",A History of Violence

Any plot there MIGHT have been was over by the middle of this absolutely flavorless movie (about 45 minutes in). I remember my girlfriend leaning over at this time and whispering ""where does this movie have to go now?"". My thoughts EXACTLY!

Boring movie, formulaic, wants to make a point about something but forgets what it is. Sure, great 'performances' if you're into that kind of thing, but you walk out of the theater feeling like 'what the f*** was that about?'

912,shahid_fc,Great acting; shallow script.,6,12 September 2005,"I saw this film at the Toronto Film Festival, expecting a deep exploration of the roots of violence supported by Cronenberg's typically brilliant & gruesome visuals (Crash, The Fly, ExiStenz). Well, the scenes were graphic, rivaling Tarentino's plays in both Kill Bills. Viggo's character ended up being more comic-book than anything else, with the uber-ability to take out 5 armed guys without (initally) packing heat. Think Bourne Identity meets Mel Gibson's character in Payback - yes, he's THAT good! But each story traces the shallow cause of violence. Cronenberg does not go into the shadows (History?) of violence. The history of the violence here is taken literally. Somebody is violent and incites more violence as retribution. Somebody had a violent past and goes back to it. Any one of the stories would have been great material to go deeper into, (especially the son's) but the movie wraps up before anything of substance can be explored. 6 outta 10.An enjoyable flick nonetheless.----REVISION----One of the most often heard pieces of advice given to a first time viewer of art/music/film is to go in without any preconceived ideas. If you do that, there is a slim chance you'll get what you expected. I think that's what happened to me with this film. My preconceived idea was that the script should explore, then question (in a critical way) the fundamental motivations behind violence. Because of this, I appreciated the acting and the characters, but was disappointed by the script, which lessened my appreciation for the film. What brought on this confession? David Cronenberg himself in an EYE Weekly review by Jason Anderson:-----While critics have already tried to read the film as a critique of movie violence or even of violence's role in American society, Cronenberg resists such interpretations, saying he was only interested in how it would be used by his characters. ""I asked myself, 'What was violence to these guys? Was it a sadistically pleasurable thing? No, it was business. It's very functional and therefore you get it over with as fast as you can and you get on with everything else""Cronenberg says that another title for A history of Violence might've been 'Scenes from a Marriage'. ""We joked about it on the set,"" he says. ""There was this sense that this was a portrait of a marriage in all kinds of ways, especially under duress.""-----As a character driven movie, maybe even a dark comedy, this film is a success, and I can understand the immense praise that most reviews have given it. Ratings are a personal thing, so I still feel my enjoyment of it was a 6, but I understand and appreciate where the 8 and aboves are coming from. Still an enjoyable flick....",A History of Violence

Absolutely awful script. Mixed bag acting, but the bad far outweighed the good. Subplot about the son contributed zero to the film.

917,jae_the_fiend,Viggo Shines,8,7 October 2005,"Before I begin, let me state that I have not been the hugest fan of Viggo Mortensen. I believe his acting was decent in the LOTR trilogy, but other than that, I haven't seen much of his work, and therefore haven't been subjected to his acting skills. Today I drove forty minutes to go see this movie with a friend, because, simply put, it looked like it would be a good way to spend a free Friday afternoon, and the nearest theater playing it was in Orlando. I wasn't actually thinking about how good it was going to be until the first five minutes of the movie began, which might I add, was exceptionally shocking. The entire movie blew my mind, and the violence was top notch and done very tastefully, in my opinion. The drama, the acting, the action, and just about everything was done so well. I must say now that I've seen Viggo in this film that I look forward to seeing more of his films. He shone as the average American hero who did what he had to when lives are in danger. Ashton Holmes, who plays Tom Stall's son Jack, did well to capture an adolescent who only wants to be like his dad, who seems to be the perfect husband and father. Maria Bello, who plays as Tom's wife Edie, performs wonderfully as the wife who would do anything to protect her family, but begins to doubt when new light is shed on her husband. Let's not forget Ed Harris, either; his creepy demeanor and sour attitude only add to the frightening effect he has on the screen in this film. Overall, the film carries an essence that allows us to delve not just into the life of violence, but what comes after. I'm definitely going to buy this film when it comes out on DVD to show to all my friends.I give it an 8 out of 10.",A History of Violence
918,ElfLover,Could have been good...,1,2 October 2005,"Have you ever seen a movie that led you to almost completely lose respect for the actors in it? Well, this was one of those films. It was appalling. Between the stilted dialogue, the unstructured script, the looong drawn out scenes (instead of showing us 1 whole minute of someone walking, cut it short - we get the idea, he's walking...), and the awkward and graphic sex, this was probably one of the most terrible movies I have ever seen. I found myself checking my watch every five minutes. But it was similar to a car accident... I couldn't turn my head away... mostly because I was shocked into a stupor. After Lord of the Rings, I thought that Viggo Mortensen could do no wrong... he's a single card actor with one of the biggest movies ever under his belt... and then he goes and chooses this, well, garbage. Watching the sporadic sex scenes was like watching a soft-core pornography... the ""violence"" in the movie was cool, the 3 times it happened. I don't believe this was supposed to be a comedy, but the theatre was filled with laughter.All in all, I believe that this was probably a good book (and I intend on reading it to find out), but the people responsible for making this into a movie (particularly the writer), should be flogged.",A History of Violence
919,BluesBro715,Someone actually sat down and wrote this?,2,17 October 2005,"This is honestly one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. I'm usually very forgiving of movie's faults, especially if I'm shelling out 9 bucks to see it. But this movie was shockingly awful; there is no way around it. Let's examine the overall theme: If you kill a lot of people in the past... (now wait for the genius) you're going to have to kill MORE people to get away from killing people. Wow, what a fantastic dilemma. The fight scenes are needlessly violent (and I'm a product of the nineties so I'll be the last person to say violence doesn't belong in movies) and held nothing more than a quick cheap thrill and some shock value. The sex scenes are unnecessarily graphic; if this was an erotic thriller that was studying the elements of passion or how sexuality can exist in a small town too then it'd be fine. It wasn't really a problem until the sex on the stairs which established nothing more that angry sex is good and that the stairs is a bad place to do it. How deep. Oh, and the wife is a whore. But the overall problem of this is that there is no plot structure. It has no exposition, Stall's past is mentioned only in vague conversation. The plot thread of the son was an absolute joke. A caught ball in gym class? Are you serious? The son inherited his father's ""history of violence""...wow, didn't see that coming. Compare the whole ""killing your way to solution"" motif that this movie uses to similar cases. Man on Fire-fanfrickintastic (remember that beginning half hour where they bond?

What keeps me chuckling is the fact that the supporters don't seem to understand that the ""brilliance, depth and sensitivity"" that seemed so obvious to them was in fact startlingly absent. If you're a fan of the director, just saying that this is his best doesn't make it a good film.What I'm trying to say is simply this: we (the folks that were anything but impressed), we get it. Violence, sex, family, human nature, the whole nine yards. The movie tackles some interesting themes and I would be willing to admit that there was some interesting insight into all of them. But man, was it boring.The acting was not that great, the dialogue made me flinch more than once, and the cinematography was riddled with uninspired ""unique"" shots. (The view from the window, the odd-angled shots of the diner -- and how many headlights did we get closeups of?) A brilliant piece of film-making? Nah. An interesting film? Sure, I suppose.

921,grepsy,"A decent movie, but a horrible movie based on a book",4,15 December 2005,"As a movie, A History of Violence is a decent movie with good acting on the behalf of both Viggo Mortensen and Ed Harris that holds the viewer's interest until the end. However, as a movie ""based"" on a book it is horrible. Now, before anyone fusses about the fact that it is hard to make a 1 1/2 hour movie out of a 286 page graphic novel I agree. Now, I have no qualms with the embellishment of the story line, and the adding of additional material, such as the addition of Tom's sons life. But what does bother me is when an adaptation completely change not only the middle and end to a book, but also change a characters attitude and how his family treats him is absurd. Also, the movie's gratuitous sex scenes seem oddly tacked on, and add absolutely nothing to the work. Now, as you have read, this review does contain spoilers. There are several reviews on this site that talk about the plot of the story, and review it as just a movie, feel free to read their review and take mine with a grain of salt. However, I want to point out the major changes in the plot, and you can decide for yourself if this movie should even share it's name with the book.Just as a note, Tony and Joey are the same people. Joey is Tony's name, before he left New York.Joey has no brother, and Richie was his friend. Joey really only committed two acts of real violence when he helped Richie rob some mobsters, and when he tore out Fogarty's eye with the barbed wire in self-defense. Joey is taken to New York to tell his story about the robbery (he was from New York not Pennsylvania) and there he was contacted by the mob and said they would kill Richie if he didn't come and see them. Joey then ""escapes"" from the mob guys he meets only to be captured by the bosses son who tortures him. Joey ends up killing the bosses son. At the end of the book, Richie has been tortured for 20 some odd years and nothing but a torso and a head. Throughout the book, Joey is a kind man and only fights when he has too. After telling his wife and son the truth about his past, they don't hate him or feel like they've been betrayed, they still love him and support him. Joey's wife even goes to New York with him. The idea that Cronenberg tries to implant that Joey is a natural born killer, and that he is crazy isn't what the original character is at all. Also, the movie makes it sound like Joey spent his entire life with crime, when in reality he spent no more than 5 minutes as a violent criminal.The only things that are the same about the book and the movie are the character names, the scenes in the coffee shop, and the idea behind the front yard fight with Fogarty. With almost 3/4 of the book missing from the movie, and it changing how Joey is and how his family treats him I don't think this movie should even share the same name as this great book. They should have put in small letters somewhere on the poster, ""Inspired by a great book, screwed up by a bad writer.""",A History of Violence

It affords a jolt to the viscera, but unless it's the first one you've ever had, you're not likely to remember it a few days hence.It's a paean to the staccato violence has been fashionable in thrillers of late. The Bourne films and ""Collateral"" offer examples of technical perfection in this sub-genre, but sadly, ""History"" is an example of big budget amateurism. The carnage scenes are so ponderous that one could easily imagine the victims standing around, looking at their watches as they await their turn in the fray.The heavies our hero finds himself entangled with are, for the most part, professional, seasoned, cold blooded killers. As I understand it, their ilk are successful because you realize you've gotten on their bad side about the same time you find yourself being drawn down a surreal tunnel towards a bright light. Moreover, unlike in the aforementioned better made films wherein the hapless adversaries have no idea what they're letting themselves in for, Mortensen's antagonists, knowing exactly who he is and what he's capable of,engage him with suicidal nonchalance.As for the acting, I'm not sure anyone could play the lead role because it's a dubious proposition to posit that the nature of the duality of character we're asked to accept could even exist. One thing is certain, Mortensen didn't pull it off.Most of the other actors are dutifully journeyman-like. Maria Bello does a creditable job with the part of the loving wife. The parts of the criminals are consistently ruined for the reasons mentioned with the exception of William Hurt's turn as the hugely entertaining, if less than credible mobster brother.

The subplots were given as much emphasis as the main plot, and as a result the entire story was anorexic.

This was a waste of money, I would have rather burned a ten dollar bill (literally)This movie had potential... the truth, there was even a few good scenes and the plot was interesting at times... however, the acting was worse than a production by ""Intro to Drama 101"" and the sexual perversion and horribly directed porno scenes were enough to leave anyone feeling bad for watching this movie. The sex scenes were so out of place that I heard people laughing in the theater during them. They went way over board to the point of being bitterly disgusting and meaningless. I'd give this movie three thumbs down if I had another hand!",A History of Violence

Probably some kind of confirmation bias due to its director, because, well, the movie is TERRIBLE bad.Bad acting, bad plot, bad violence scenes, bad sex scenes, damn, the whole movie just doesn't work out. It has a promising beginning, but after the first half hour it justs become a really awful movie that tries at all costs to be some kind of 2000's masterpiece, it just pushes it too hard, everything is made in the intention of ""shocking"" you, and while it may actually work for some people, it does not for someone who is used to movies that REALLY set boundaries in being shocking like the ol'good exploitation movies.",A History of Violence
930,geordiekid,Painting a picture,7,3 January 2006,This films starts slowly and it looks early on to be degenerating into a Hollywood dramafest. Don't be disheartened as I was the first time I watched this.Quickly it paints a picture and it's not a horrible Hollywood tapestry that you might have come to except. This film combines violence of the blatant variety and although it's wonderful to watch from a movie-goer's perspective it's still got the humanity of the struggle of the family who have to come to terms with the difficulty of some of the realities which present itself through the film.The greatest compliment I can pay to this film is the uniqueness of it all. It's very different.I hope you enjoy it. I certainly did.,A History of Violence
931,Bobbadoc,"Profound, perfect",10,25 October 2005,"It's not about the violence. It's about the entanglements that can rob us of our most precious relationships and accomplishments and of peace with ourselves and our loved ones. This movie is perfectly written, directed, and acted. The most difficult of roles are portrayed seamlessly. The production values achieve the highest standards imaginable. This motion picture asks many questions. I think the most pervasive and important is ""Do you mean what you say when you talk about the paramount importance of family values?"" Further: ""If you do, what are you willing to do to protect your family -- not just from the paltry threats of your environment but from the subtle and elusive demons that haunt each of us?""

932,iaosun93,"disappointing, and ultimately, despicable",3,2 October 2005,"This movie was quite well-crafted - on the surface. Interesting story, good performances, tense atmosphere. But in the end, there were just too many holes in the moral and psychological dimensions of the plot - not things you'd notice at first, but upon deeper reflection, won't go away. And it's this ultimate lacking of a deeper point that makes this film despicable. To subject your audience to such intimate and emotional violence for what amounts to no good reason at all, where even a gore or ultraviolent action flick at least has a sense of distance if not a point, is to deceive people into accepting it on a more significant level than lesser films. It's not that Cronenberg refuses to judge his characters and their psychotic behavior, it's that he DOES judge them, but slyly hides his approval, and maybe even admiration, behind a thin veneer of apparent ambiguity. I used to think Cronenberg was a harmless goremonger with an existentialist bent, but now I have to wonder if he's not just a sociopath behind a bullhorn.",A History of Violence
933,Plodder,A History of Nothing,1,5 October 2005,"I went in to this movie expecting to be entertained and enjoy the movie. Within 15mins I was wondering what the heck was the plot in this movie.The whole side story with the son Jack was just stupid and a contrived conflict with schoolmates that I could barely choke down. Seriously, someone gets angry during a gym class of baseball because they lost? Really? What high school did this freak go to? Tom/Joey was not believable. I could understand someone who lead a life of crime wanting to get out and start a new life and have regrets about their past. But Joey did not seem to be running from a life of crime because he wanted a new start. He was running because he knew he crossed the line and did not want to deal with the consequences. This was not a man of remorse for his past. This was a man hiding from his past that has now caught up with him. After he kills the mob guys and then goes back to his old digs there is nothing in his character that says he regrets his past and is trying to lead an honest life. Not only was it boring it made no sense at all as to why this plot was still going on.The acting was terrible. The little girl could have easily been replaced by a doll. Her reaction to her dad coming back after being missing for so many days was abnormal. Jack's character could have had maybe more life to him if the actor was not so terrible. But the whole scene where he pummels the jock was ludicrous! Did the movie suddenly morph into a super-hero action flick because where the heck did Jack all of a sudden develop killer like moves like his father? Was the writer trying to imply that he was his father's son with killer moves and the ability to hurt without remorse? Tom/Joey's return in the end was bizarre. Again - did not feel like the character was remorseful and wanted his peaceful life back. Nor did you get the feeling that he missed his family. It seemed like he was just bent on getting rid of those in his past so he could continue with the life he had become comfortable with. Which in my eyes was totally different than someone who came back because he wanted forgiveness from his family and a chance to bring them together again.The contrived love between Tom and Edie was also forced. The sex scenes were just awkward. Did not get any indication of love from either character. And could she have looked a little less haggard all the time? They made her look like junkie for god sakes! I have to say the storyline was terrible. Acting was marginal at best by some of the actors. There was no suspense or drama anywhere in the story. And the ending was a farce.I will lose all faith in the Oscars if this movie or any of the actors even get a nomination!",A History of Violence

This movie was horrible and focused on parts like awkward sex scenes for about 10 minutes and was probably the worst acting I have ever come across. I'd rather watch a guy take a crap on a toilet than watch this movie. Hell, actually I rather watch a Keanu Reeves and Pauly Shore marathon than watch this piece of mindless garbage.....down right horrible. The hack that played the son in this movie is quite possibly the worst actor ever. You would get more entertainment out of watching a blank wall than watching that kid try to act. Another thing about this movie is the uncalled for sex scenes. And the director focused on them for seriously about 10 minutes each.

935,dirtyone,Great study involving Darwinism and the importance (or not) of the past,9,27 September 2005,"I saw this movie and loved it. I was taken in part by one of the central issues of whether one owes his/her loved one an open and honest description of his/her past. Tom has obviously hidden his violent youth in order to bury it (from himself as well as from his family). He has moved on. Now he's forced to face his past because his instincts are ingrained and really cannot be turned off. Very provocative (especially in light of the two sex scenes).Also, this movie reflects a more base ideal: Survival of the fittest. Early on, we see predators who are effective in their psychotic hunt. That is, until they meet Tom, who is a more effective ""predator"" (or at least hunter/defender). It certainly highlights Darwin's theories.Hope this movie does well. I'm sick of ""I'm a slasher, watch me kill, part III"".",A History of Violence

Mostly in awe of the amazing film making---the lack of hype, of the typical Hollywood ""blockbuster"" top seller, of special effects and clichés. The acting was impeccable, the script intelligent, the editing clean, with great pacing---not too fast, not too slow, and not too long, a fault of so many films today. A beautifully clear, complex, yet simple movie, with great cinematography---wonderful creative shots, nothing boring, nothing excessive.

Well, it's called ""A History of Violence"", and it's directed by David Cronenberg! What did they expect? The film is, simply put, amazing. Anyone who enjoys Cronenberg's other films will greatly appreciate this one. It speaks on many levels, and I suggest seeing it more than once to fully take it all in. Beautiful performances all around. I felt as though that is how people put in a situation like that would really act.

If Viggo Mortenson wasn't in it they coulda sold that to Maximum channel as a soft core porno and replaced Viggo for like Billy Baldwin. Every ones talking about Oscar buzz, but Hurts performance was comedic, Harris was just a neutron, Mortenson was just ehh , and Bello was hot.

939,Biggyworth,Truth or dare?,10,4 October 2005,"A movie that has some originality to it and has long been overdue. It just goes to show you that no matter how much one tries to overcome his or her past, there will always be someone there trying to take you back for their own purposes. The movie illustrated the anguish a person has to go through in order to make the issue of truth known once the process of lying begins. It not only impacts on the actual person, but has a rippling effect on those that he or she may truly love and care about the most. To know the truth is not the easiest task in the world to deal with and this movie in a crazy way justifies the reason people go through great lengths to disassociate themselves from it. Even one's own family can cause the greatest amount of grief and suffering by not letting things go. I hope that people viewing this film can truly identify with the main focus point that while it may not be easy to start over, some things will eventually have to stay the same. If Tom did not have his instincts about him, the beginning of the film would have truly been tragic. But to be able to react to dealing with deadly consequences in a moment's notice has its benefits. But I also think that his wife played the revelation of learning about Joey with too much drama. The scene on the stairway showed that she was still in love with the man she learned to hate. How is that for irony? Excellent film, nonetheless.",A History of Violence

What does it make? 2 hours of mediocre entertainment. The plot is so simple that you never have to pay attention in fear or missing something. You can pretty much figure out everything as it comes, and the characters give you nothing to care about.The son's conflict with the school bully is so fake and not how actual young people act. Not to mention the story is forced and hollow, trying to complicate the plot with a 'parallel' story but the character motivations just weren't there. Nothing about this movie engaged my spirit, or my concentration. If you want to watch a movie with about 10 minutes of pretty cool stuff, aka the killing and sex scenes, but about 110 minutes where you are told things you already from the title, go ahead and spend money on it, I'm glad this one was on my roommate's tab.",A History of Violence

This movie is just terrible. No other way to say it. However, don't let me mislead you. The writing is without question some of the worst I have ever seen, and the supporting cast around Mortensen and Harris certainly don't help the situation, but the movie is actually hilarious. The scenes are just so ridiculously over the top it is hard not to crack up at them. The school bully is one of the funniest characters I've watched this year. The movie appears to just be a collection of scenes that drawn out entirely too long and a majority of which really don't add to the development of the rather weak main story line. I'm not saying don't go see this movie. Instead, I am saying please go see it, but don't go see it expecting a masterpiece but something so bad you'll leave the theater still laughing at it.",A History of Violence
943,kfledson-1,"Tension filled, beautifully lit with great music",7,9 April 2006,"An interesting film from Cronenburg, much more main stream than his previous films. The tension was superb and its source varied throughout the film from the first moment in the motel office to the final scene when Tom/Joey returns home. Tension around the potential for violence itself, tension within the characters and tension between characters. The music was used to great effect to further heighten the tension. The lighting was excellent and also added to the tension and characterisations, Tom/Joey was frequently shot in half shadow, on the face of it a crude, but in this case an effective, way of demonstrating his hidden past when in Millbrook and his hidden present when back with his brother Ritchie. Another interesting aspect of the film were some of the unusual camera shots which could be construed as artificial but which added another dimension to the film. Although some of the violence had me turning away it was effective in demonstrating the extreme violence of Joey's past in direct comparison to his current persona as Tom. Overall an enjoyable and interesting film which held my attention throughout.",A History of Violence
944,howellp,Soft-Core Porn Meets Violence without Action,2,28 September 2005,"This was the worst movie I've seen since ""Cabin Fever."" The acting is terrible: if you like Viggo Mortensen, DO NOT see this film--your image of him as a good actor will be destroyed. This is only partly his fault--all the characters are poorly written and completely unsympathetic and unbelievable. It is not apparent who the ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"" are because the scenes descend into violence too soon to further the storyline. The explicit sex scenes were unnecessary, too long, and bordering on disgusting. The only action in the film was the shooting, and these scenes were over too soon to get into them, or to find any reason for the violence in the first place. The dialogue doesn't further the storyline, either, and the lack of soundtrack in most of the scenes makes it seem like it is still in pre-production. The only redeeming value of the film happens the first three minutes, in which there is a sight gag with one of the bad guys and his car. That scene could be added to a good film, and this one would be completely unmourned as it dies a quiet death.",A History of Violence

You get the feeling that both films are direct responses to 9/11. How American society is saying its acceptable to kill to people if you suspect them of threatening your family, not that I don't agree or disagree but I just wonder whether or not these films would have been made in the way they were pre 9/11? I doubt Hollywood would have let the so called protagonists return to normal life after the incidents, but they did which I find very interesting.

946,jimbo29,Struggling for material?,5,11 April 2006,"In my opinion, which is all I can give, this was a very average film. I will give some specific examples and so people can see where I am coming from...1) They spent quite a bit of time at the start showcasing the characters of the 2 initial killers. There seemed to be an uneasy relationship and it seemed like that might prove interesting as the film progressed... it didn't... they died in the first 10 mins.2) The whole sub plot of the brother being teased by the 'jock' was so obvious and stale as a piece of writing. Lazy, actually. How many times have you seen that storyline? It was like watching an episode of the OC.3) The sex scenes were a little OTT, and what was the second, rape-like, one all about? Just because something is weird doesn't make it good. Also the flash of muff and boob from Maria Bello was superfluous (and awesome) in the same sort of way as Halle Berry in Swordfish. Lazy.4) His brother Richard was the least convincing mafia boss I have seen in any movie. And when he goes down over to the lake afterwards and shouts 'Oh, Richie!', did anyone else think... hmm that was a bit weird/cr*p.5) I have seen many people post on here talking about the subtlety of the film. I would object and say it was the least subtle piece of movie-making I have seen for a while. All the characters acted as you would expect, the story was totally one dimensional.Overall, I think there were lots of scenes that were irrelevant and not all that interesting... so why were they in there you ask? I believe the reason is that the plot was so thin they needed to stretch it out. The whole film was 91 minutes before the credits came up. No serious film nowadays is under 90 mins. I think they were struggling for material and so made too much of what little substance the film had.I look forward to hearing your views....",A History of Violence

The problem I had with it is it seems like the director made them much more gratuitous than necessary, for the ""shock"" value. Close ups of guys with their faces blown off, noses gone, blood leaking out of the back of the head...seems a little contrived after you see the scene where he actually does this to the people. After seeing Tom/Joey smash a guy in the nose 5 times, what does it add by showing the guy gasping on the ground with his nose gone? Also, the cheerleader scene....what's the deal with the 69?

948,jeralhou,What a terrible movie,2,1 March 2016,"Glorifying gun violence with extremely shallow characters and terrible hokey dialogue, this movie never gets off the ground. And of course, the protagonist, rather antagonist in hiding, has kung-fu skills that allow him to kill several men in the span of several seconds. The plot is hardly believable: The wife wants to spice up the sex life with her husband so she dons a cheerleader costume. At one point she kissed a visiting sheriff on the lips to bid him goodbye. Then, after finding her husband has been living a lie(which causes her to throw up in the toilet)passionately make loves to him on the stairs. Even the son becomes superman in a fit of rage and sends a bully and his friend to hospital. The movie has no climax. The main character feels the need to drive somewhere far off to settle a score. Then, after putting a bullet hole in his brother's head, he takes off his shirt to show his manly torso and wash the blood off in a nearby pond. Even the ending is unbelievable, as he returns to an unloving family with tears in his eyes.

The violent killer Stall retired himself in the desert, a place of the mind not only a place on the earth. In his terrible loneliness he thinks: "" I want to be different from the man Ihave been in the past"". But this is only a choice, non a real change, and the past could reemerge, abruptly.

The short but significant roles by Ed Harris and William Hurt are the perfect touch.Make no mistake, this movie is dark; it will never develop into a ""pop"" film like you may expect it to, but if you are a fan of the obscure, especially in Cronenberg fashion, you will certainly enjoy this destined-to-be classic.",A History of Violence

The movie has the pace of a slow drag that pulls you along hoping that at some point you might be rewarded with some sort of grotesque violence. But even the hope of violence is put to rest as one must follow a poorly drawn out plot that is accompanied by horrible acting which bids adieu to the casting director of this film from the get go. Well lets just suppose that you can sit through the overall boring plots there is also the unneeded and at some points awkward and violent sexual scenes that did nothing to enhance the film but severely added to the overall disgusting waste of time that the movie is.

The two flaws i have with this movie are the child acting and the overly cheesy first half hour that took me out of the movie but other than that the movie is harsh and real and it unexpectedly got under my skin, simply great.",A History of Violence
959,ryanp555,terrible waste of time,1,19 March 2006,"I like a lot of dumb or bad movies, I can sit through them and watch them. However, this movie was just plain old BAD. I couldn't stand it, it had no point. They got the least menacing mobsters, are they even Italian? The acting was crappy. They left a lot of things unexplained, like Joey's background. All we know is that he was a psycho who killed people. I don't recall them ever explaining why he tried to attack Carl Fogarty. On the back of the movie box it should read, ""Great movie if you want to put yourself in a suicidal mood!"" I can't believe I wasted my time with this movie, I feel that much more dumb! Thanks Hollywood for churning out a totally dumpy movie!",A History of Violence
960,way2qwik,Just because you didn't get it...,9,1 October 2005,"doesn't mean it's a bad movie. It's obvious from some of the negative comments I read that the unintelligent among us who cannot appreciate bold film-making can unfortunately type their inane comments. ""A History of Violence"" is a daring film where the depraved violence in the movie is neither gratuitous or simplistic. It is a vehicle and a complex journey that takes the viewer through the very wrenching emotional twists and turns the characters go through themselves. There are times where the squeamish among us will have to look away. But that's one of the film's most brutally effective points. How much violence can we accept before we lose our sense of morality and justice? When are such actions deemed tenable? This movie is fascinating and the last five minutes of the film are some of the most captivating and courageous in recent memory. Appreciate this film for what it is: one of the year's best.",A History of Violence
961,irishmuffin,Did Ed Harris really want to be in this movie?,1,2 April 2006,"The dialog and plot were so trite and obvious that I wouldn't be surprised if Ed Harris asked to be killed off early in the piece. Was anyone actually surprised when brother Richie called? And what was William Hurt thinking? Talk about miscasting! And are we really supposed to believe that a killer like Joey can change his spots by moving to the desert for three years? And why did he? No explanation. Very little of this plot makes sense physically, emotionally, or psychologically. The poor script supervisor must have been laughing his or her head off. If this was supposed to show how violence begets violence, it failed miserably.",A History of Violence
962,scotttigger,Just awful.,1,31 March 2006,"What a truly dreadful / awful movie. Gratuitous sex and violence, wooden acting... The trailer looked so promising, with a great cast, but the movie itself was woefully disappointing.I see the movie is based on a 'graphic novel' of the same name, and indeed this movie is graphic in detail, which I feel is to the detriment of the movie. Some of the scenes continue for too long, without adding anything further to the plot.The characters were not believable, as the acting was so stilted and wooden at most times. There was very little on screen chemistry between the major actors, and I found myself cringing at some of the lines being delivered. I enjoy most movies I watch, or at least find some redeeming features, but this movie was not one of them.",A History of Violence
963,humppakuukeri,Thought-provoking in a disturbing way,8,3 January 2015,"The movie makes you think, and not so nice things. ""People sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf."" G. Orwell - We are taught to think that ""Violence isn't solution."" But what if someone would do violence to us? Violence takes only one person, the one who wants to use it. The victim doesn't have to agree to it. Victim will not be asked ""Is this OK by your morals?""And to effectively fight the evil, can you avoid being evil? Males are in society often the ones who use violence, in wars and peace. Women are mostly passive victims or bystanders. But this movie made me think (a thought that has crossed my mind earlier) that are women in fact encouraging men to be violent? Edie (Maria Bello) is very excited to see her husband kill the bad guys. He is a hero and shows up in TV. ""I kinda like it."" Edie says. She likes her husband to be hero, but she doesn't have to risk anything for it. Much like in wars, when women stay home with children and men go to frontline, to see who is the toughest guys and biggest bull. Weak men die and will be forgotten, stronger survive, become war heroes and remain on the pages of history. Many women are attracted to a war hero, or a man in a dangerous profession, where there is a risk of physical injury / death. Women are attracted to men of physical ability. While women themselves usually choose more safe jobs like nurse or teacher (or layer, like Edie in the movie).I found it disturbing that Edie was turned even more on, after she realized her man was a killer. She wanted sex with him, more than ever. She didn't want a tender man deep down, she wanted a dominant one. She lied for him and protected him from police, even though she knew he is wanted for murders. I've always felt, that some women are like that underneath. It might be more common in everyday life than it seems. Some of them won't admit it, some don't know about it. Murderes get love letters from women into prisons all over the world, in real life. Female convicts don't get those. Only male. I think there's even a term for it, Hybristophilia. Being attracted to inmates and men that have proved the capability to extreme violence (murderers). No guy want's to date a murderer. Only women do have this twisted quality about them. Of course they are a minority, but still the phenomena is clearly notable in jails around the globe. When Ted Bundy was captured and went to court, women flocked to see a glimpse of him. Same thing has happened with countless killers and sociopaths - some women are attracted to them. When Aileen Wuornos was convicted, there wasn't this kind of male fan phenomenon. Female inmates or violent women are not popular at all among men.Sometimes I feel women are the more dark and twisted gender. This movie was in that way realistic and brought to my mind saddening thoughts about humanity and way of the world. Women *are* evil. They are not active perpetrators, they cause harm and evil to the world in non-direct and passive way, that easily avoids the eye.Of course a man can't be a doormat. A man has to stand up for himself, to be admired by women. But violence that causes permanent injury or death is never justified. I hope some women can get truly attracted to more peaceful men, because otherwise humanity is doomed to have a bloody and war-ridden future. Until the dawn of time.The movie was well directed and acted. But it was also disturbing in it's message. But possibly true.",A History of Violence
964,alexschifferegger,Philosophically Flat,5,1 April 2006,"A History of Violence - What upsets a brilliantly paced and visually inspired film is a disconnect from its core principle - that violence is ubiquitous and random. We know better: violence almost always happens to someone else, far away. Cronenberg fails to bring it closer, and thus the film becomes an interesting genre piece: artful and well crafted, but philosophically a bit flat. Throughout, performances are stunning: Harris and fellow mobster William Hurt affect spot on, interesting interpretations of what could have been mere stock characters; while Mortensen and Bello compliment one another, and carry an identifiable spark into their roles. However, even the best acting too often plays like Pantomime, and no matter how incendiary the performances, some of the characters come off as two-dimensional.",A History of Violence

This movie has all the elements that keep me riveted: Action, love, family complications, suspense, and revenge. You must also see the making of DVD. It made me even more impressed with this film as there were a couple of points made that I missed.

968,akafiTz,Who I really am? Family is everything.,9,22 May 2006,"I just watched this movie and it upset me. This movie is just beautiful and subtle. The acting is fabulous, every single part of the movie is ""feeling"". Sometimes extra-words are not useful, only picture can translate the atmosphere and tautness. It's a realistic movie, not an Hollywood-action one. The music during action scenes is superb, the words are weigh. The hero is confronted to a dilemma : Should he try to preserve his family life or should he face up his history, this well-named History of Violence? But when the past came to him, he could't lie anymore to his family and to himself and had no choice but to face it. The choice of the music, always soft is really good : it reminds a drama movie, and it is kinda it because his whole family can't bear the Hero has got two faces : The good one, perfect father of a middle class family running a normal and happy life, and the bad (dead!?) one, remorseful murderer who still is the best in his domain. The strength of the movie resides in the thought about human being. In normal life, there is no bad people and good people, everybody is good in a way but evil is another, everybody evil man can repent and has the right to try to be happy. The ending is beautiful : when his wife and son know why he went out, they stare at him with disdain while the little sister, in her age of innocence, still consider him as a father and not as an assassin. This is my first comment on IMDb, and if I did it (i am usually so lazy) it is because you can't past through it. It only lasts 1h30, but it is really""concentrated"", so you never get bored, and you can enjoy it wholly.This movie deserves to be in the Top 250 of the IMDb. fiTz.",A History of Violence
969,sarahchuggins,Terrible and disrespectful,1,1 October 2005,"Basically, this movie is disrespectful and rather disturbing. The graphic scenes are not done artistically or tastefully. The director is obviously trying to just go beyond any other movie in graphic category. The sex scene at the beginning could be cute and sweet, but instead it is too long and rather awkward. The other sex scene is more like rape and totally unnecessary in length. Sex scenes can be tastefully done but this movie does not portray them in that light. I think that this movie has a really interesting premise but is supported by lack luster directing. The screen play is beautifully written and definitely keeps you on your toes. But the sex and violence and unnecessarily vulgar and do not allow the audience to respect the movie as a piece of art. True artists are able to take the evil in the world and make it evident and suspenseful through outlets such as music and through artistic scenes.",A History of Violence

See it a second time, and you will ""get it"" even more. The violence was terrifically shot and painfully realistic. The scene in their front yard was tense and brutal. Watch as Mortensen ""changes"" ever so subtly. He is fascinating to watch. The sex scenes and the emotions involved were unbelievable to watch. Very real, not romantic and ""beautiful"", showing ""perfect"" bodies. Both Mortensen and Bello should be commended for being so brave. Very sad and disturbing film. One of the years best films by far.

Viggo Mortensen is a brilliant actor and his depiction of a man who almost fooled himself, until reality hit one day is outstanding. Maria Bello matches the performance as well, rarely seen, but hopefully more in the future. Her presence feels natural. The ending is just perfect as it gives the viewer no answer. The Christ theme I was thinking of during the movie, even though Jesus supplely should be sacrificing himself, I don't find Tom Stall doing that in the end. Cynicly, he just wanted his life back no matter the consequences. And like when watching f.ex. American Beauty, I take notice of the natural access to guns in a private home.

973,mcoldmoon,No thrills whatsoever - dead boring!,1,31 October 2005,"First of all, this film had no tension or character development. The plot hung on flimsy, 2-dimensional ""secrets"" and ""mysteries"" (which one could figure out about 10 minutes into the movie, not to mention that every review in the paper gave it away - one went hoping for more, but found that what the review had given away was all that the film concealed). Not to mention cheap, pseudo-symbolic stuff and primitive, two-dimensional ""characters."" ""Thriller?"" Only the brain-dead might get a few chills.I must add that it is particularly regrettable to see such excellent actors as Ed Harris and William Hurt involved (that's what got me in the door in the first place), although it probably entailed just one or two shooting days for them (I guess it's better than doing a commercial, because it's still a ""film"").

I did not know before attending that it was based on a ""graphic novel"" (the oxymoron of all time) but my heart sank when I saw that info in the opening credits. My husband wanted to leave fairly early (after the ""I think I will run home on my injured foot"" scene which caused some audience laughter - this could not have been what the director ""intended"") but I asked him to stay because I could not figure out how there could possibly be any climax to a movie that was SOOOO predictable and had no dramatic (or even character) arc. I stayed until the scene on the stairs - and left because violence as foreplay is just too unacceptable. Slow pace, really bad dialogue, unsympathetic characters - a real triple threat.

The sex scenes were the utmost pornographic material, and the movie really could have done without them. It was also SO slow I was just dying for it to end. The only good parts in the movie was the gorish violence; the guy's busted up nose, entrails on Joey's chest, bullet through his brother's head and blood splattering everywhere behind him. The title of the movie doesn't match the movie at all because if I hadn't seen any previews of this movie, I would have thought it was some big History Channel movie hitting the big screens.

980,alanfjone5-1,"Great premise, spoiled by poor plot presentation. Overrated!",2,6 October 2005,"This film had great premise, but? The plot appeared thought provoking and my expectations were high, because many critics had scored this quite highly. However, once the actors appeared my expectations fell dramatically. The acting in the first half is both wooden and unemotional, not what you would expect from a close and loving family environment - which is what Cronenberg is trying to portray with the Stalls. The dialogue when the Stall family are together is slow and flat, the characterisations being shallow and too unbelievable. The impression given is one of strangers in a lift that has just broken down. Poor musical scoring does not help the laboured atmosphere. By the halfway point I was convinced I had made the wrong decision, as two people close to me had fallen asleep and I was going to be next. To the film's credit the acting improves tremendously when first Ed Harris and then later William Hurt appear. However, the background plot supporting their roles is both scant and tatty, quite clearly needing more depth.

Grown adults with children having sex in the wife's parents' house to substitute for their lack of a teenage romance? And all this happens in the first fifteen minutes or so? The fact is that the movie isn't developed enough for the story or motives of the characters to be believable. This could practically be assumed upon realizing that film is the length of a Disney animated feature, obviously not long enough for the development of what so many pseudo-intellectuals would lead you to believe is an intricate and well developed study on human nature.My only guess is that the graphic sexual content and gratuitous violence has catered to the crowd of young males who wish they had intelligent opinions but are still subject to their basal desires.

984,zacharylittle,Unwarranted Arrogance,4,28 March 2006,"What bothers me so much about this movie is the fact that it seems to suppose that the concepts it presents are anything but ridiculously clichéd.In fact, it seems to find itself revolutionary. This is a film about a man who may have a mysterious past, living in a small town, and it acts like it is the FIRST film about a man who may have a mysterious past living in a small town.I couldn't help but wait for the twist-- something to make this movie original-- but nothing came. It remained a story about a man who may have a mysterious past. So what? I've seen the Bourne Identity (not a very good movie, but... very similar, no?) and I've seen Dogville, and that more or less covers the bases. So why did this movie feel like it was expecting its viewers to be moved by the content? Let's look at Dogville for a second: person (this time female) in a small town, keeping a secret. It explores the ""town copes with a shock"" dynamic better than AHOV, it examines relationships in a manner far less glib and superficial than AHOV, and it has a more shocking ending. It even has a better mob-character/deus ex machina in James Caan.I've heard people praise William Hurt for his abilities, creating a rounded character in less than 10 minutes of screen time. First of all, I'd like to point out that his character is not particularly rounded... but lest we forget--- he's in organized crime. Is there a conventional symbol less embedded in the national consciousness than that of the mobster? How hard is it to create this kind of character? Admittedly, James Caan is also playing a gangster of some kind in Dogville, but there, we get to examine the father-daughter dynamics so often over looked in crime movies. After all, organized crime is generally portrayed as paternal or (gasp!) fraternal.If you haven't seen this movie, and are being persuaded by the inexplicably laudatory reviews this movie garners, don't be fooled. Rent Dogville. It is a far superior film, and doesn't feel nearly as smug as A History of Violence, a movie I feel like I've seen fifty times before.",A History of Violence

987,mb444,Many satisfying stitches but somehow the quilt doesn't come out right ...,6,6 February 2011,"Much has been said by the others about the Cronenberg style, and this film continues in that tradition, with its dark, creepy, catastrophic tone ... but in departing from that tone, compromises have been made to move the plot along, and in the process of doing so, the smooth forward movement that the film needs becomes haphazard, awkward, & jagged. I have some problems with credibility.First, in the diner why is Billy (Greg Byrk) shooting (inaccurately) at the grill man (instead of Tom) while Tom is leaping over the counter to get Leland's (Stephen MacHattie)'s gun ? Second, we are asked to believe that these gangsters only found out about Tom Stall's whereabouts from the media coverage of his heroics in the diner. Did news of this type make it all the way from Indiana to Philly? Third, the Maria Bello character is just not plausible. We are asked to believe that she is a lawyer, but never once do we see her functioning as one, moreover in the home environment she comes off as overemotional & not level-headed, not like a lawyer.Fourth, William Hurt is preposterously unconvincing as the mob heavy from Philly. The goatee, the accent, his lines, all make it even worse. How he ever was considered for a Supporting Oscar is unfathomable to me.Fifth, Ritchie's (Hurt) warm greeting of Joey seems too sincere, genuine & heartfelt to be contrived - i.e. for a non-actor - and coming from one who is about to (attempt to) kill his brother.Sixth, I wonder how Joey is able to kill five guys at the Philly compound after he's just told one of Ritchie's goons (and as we see ourselves) that he has driven 16 hours straight without sleep from Indiana. I mean is Joey totally superhuman? To do what he does in Ritchie's office in such condition with seemingly little effort? In spite of all this, excellent performances by Viggo, Peter McNeill as the Sheriff, and Ed Harris as Carl Fogerty.

I'm afraid i wont remember this film in one weeks time. if you want a really slow paced deeply layered film, i think Road to perdition( as a ""gangster"" film) is much better than this- it tackles the characters and fleshes them out better.i wanted some really meaty emotions and depth to justify the extreme violence and few sex scenes. it never came, it all seemed implied, with a pretty weak script to boot. With the pace being what it was, the story and iteration between the characters had to be really strong and in my opinion it wasn't really.",A History of Violence
989,bigfatben,"slow, awkward, totally laughable...what were they thinking?",1,27 October 2005,"I had high hopes for this movie when I went to see it. I like Viggo Mortensen and Ed Harris, and the plot looked great. But the first ten minutes of the movie (which set the pace for the rest of it) were sooooo slow. A few times I thought something was going to blow up, or somebody would get killed to bring us into the action. But there was nothing. I know it sounds like I'm an action freak with ADD, but there are plenty of ""slow"" movies that I love, but they actually have substance. This movie purposely went slow and it was painful to watch. The biggest surprises of the movie were the consistency and length of the sex scenes. Even after the picture was crystal clear about what they were doing, they pushed on. For what reason, I have no idea. What is the purpose of us seeing Viggo's face pressed into his wife's crotch? Why do we later have to see his butt and post-climax thrusts? How could there be any reasoning behind that? I finally came to the realization that this movie must have originally been only 30 minutes long, but they stretched it to fit the format of a feature film. The ridiculous pauses between dialog, the unnecessarily long sex scenes, and showing every detail they could about every move they made. I just kept saying, ""OK. I get it. Let's move on."" This movie did have two redeeming qualities (which would have been fine in the 30 minute version). 1. Ed Harris is great! He has an interesting character and plays him very well. All of the scenes with him were very engaging. 2. The three major fight scenes are awesome. The first one surprised me and inspired me to think I might like this movie after all. The other two were great, too, but by that time, I had really given up on the movie already. I don't see how so many people could see this movie with it's bad writing, line delivery, unexplainable attitudes and actions (don't get me started on the schizo son), and excruciatingly slow pace and rate it anything above a 4. In fact, in my theater, most of the people were laughing at (what were supposed to be) serious parts because of how unbelievable the plot or the script was. Please don't fold to the pressure of critics. Tell them what you really think. This movie just sucks.",A History of Violence
990,tomobrkic,Plain awful,1,31 August 2018,"A history of violence.
I freaking hate this movie. It is unwatchable. It's unbearable. it's an awful,awful film and I can't stress that enough. Starting at the beginning, with screenplay. Best adapted screenplay at 59th British Academy Film Awards. Really? REALLY? I had this film downloaded for quite some time before yesterday, when I finally got around to watch it. I was choosing between this one and 'Vertigo', but since it was relatively late I decided to go with this one(since it's only hour and a half long). 7.5 on Imdb, 81 on Metascore,and 87% and 76% on Rotten tomatoes. Well, that can't be bad.
...Well, it can. It can be really bad. But, to start(or continue) with screenplay. It's like it was written by some amateur. Like someone just decided to write a screenplay without any knowledge on the subject whatsoever. Dialogue is cringe-worthy, fill of cliches and unnecessary talk, telling us stuff that anyone could figure out by themselves. Conversations and the way characters talk seems so unnatural and forced that it was hard to watch. Kids don't talk like kids, adult don't talk like (normal) adults. Movie atmosphere is non existing and the one thing that movies should make audience do(and that's care for characters), this one fails miserably. I just couldn't care less what would happen to theme. I just didn't care. How the hell can then that script get any award?? Second thing is is that throughout the whole film I just couldn't emerse myself in the story because it all seemed so fake. I just remember thinking: this is not how anyone in real life would react to this situation. Overall story and execution of same is done, in my opinion, very poorly. But, we all know more than one movie with non-existing story which make up for that with stunning visual effects and brilliant acting. Unfortunately, this is not the case here. I just saw that among many, many awards this film won, there is/are some for editing. HOW??? Just watch scene in the dinner and you will get the idea. It's pause, continue shooting, pause again and continue again. It's so amateur-like. But, that's not all that is amateur- like. Acting, for me at least, is just plain bad. of course when actors must say some poorly written lines there's so much they can do, but this was simply putted awful. Starting with kids and moving on to almost everyone. Ed Harris, and William Hurt(more or less) were good. But even the main actors. It just seemed so scripted. Like they had to learn whole script by heart and they put all their energy and focus to learning every word, that they forgot to act it out. I just can't find one good thing about the film...Well, last scene wasn't bad.
All said and done, this is one of my least favorite films I have ever watched. And I've been watching films for 17 years. More or less. So that's saying something. For me, this is a film you should watch to see how not to do the movie. It's 1/10.",A History of Violence

I don't believe people can think for themselves, when you are sitting there at the end of the film thinking you must have missed something, trying to recall a deep meaning behind this movie, don't. The problem with this movie is that it got excellent reviews so it is already imprinted in your mind that it is a great Oscar-worthy film. A History of Violence has a lot of flaws and is a pretty dry movie but is mistaken by many to be original, thought provoking, and a taught thriller.A History of Violence is not the worst movie of the year, but Oscar nominations,come on.The five minutes William Hurt is in the film is lame enough but worthy of an Oscar consideration, on what planet? David Cronenberg produces another mediocre movie, this movie will not move Cronenberg into the eye of the general public he will continue to be in the shadows, where he belongs.

I suggest that you do, because when you subsequently discover it is completely pointless, you will wish that you had. As for the rest of the movie - terrible. The sex scenes are laughable - literally, you will be laughing. The ""suspense"" disappears very early, as all is quickly revealed, leaving the audience to endure a series happenings to characters that nobody cares about.

The acting is good and believable, but what can a good actor do when presented with poor material? The movie gets going in the last 20 minutes (from when Tom Stall enters the bar to meet someone who will take him to his brother's house), when it feels like the Soprano's directing crew has taken over.All in all a very disappointing flick when considering its potential.Regards to all, silvio",A History of Violence

(SPOILERS),5,13 October 2005,"I should first start off by saying that I honestly felt like this movie was going to pull me for a twist when I least expected it (and was hoping for it the most). I was not treated to such an act of kindness, but was forced to sit through numerous scenes that panned out just the way they looked like they were going to. (SPOILERS SOON TO FOLLOW) Thus, Davey C., I offer you these two simple endings that would have made this a much better movie: Our protagonist (of sorts) pulls up the driveway in his lame-a$$ pickup truck. He's filled with questions about himself, his own identity. Who is he going to become now that he's killed the big, bad mob boss and revealed his hidden identity to his family? CUT TO: Interior of the country home. His wife sits in anticipation of his arrival. Or will he come home at all? The mood is somber as the peas and carrots are passed around the dinner table and a large loaf of meat is preyed upon by the bloodthirsty, ravenous spawn of a killer. Suddenly the front door creaks open... 1. Our protagonist walks in, his head hung low. His family almost chooses not to acknowledge his presence. Slowly, he lifts his head, he looks at the wife, ""Who the hell is Joey Cusack? I mean, seriously."" (roll credits) 2. ...Suddenly the front door creaks open. The eager family lifts their heads from their sumptuous meal and jerk them towards the door. Who could it be? It's Matt LeBlanc!!! ""How you doin???"" JOEY'S BACK!!!

I was prepared to feel a little of one thing, but mostly another, but it was switched around.This movie feels so much more real than what I was used to. I was excited.It's not the kind of movie you get to just watch like a zombie, you have to think it, and live it, to love it. If you don't like the movie, chances are you're too used to mindless junk with a bunch of killing. Even though there is a lot of killing, this movie is serious. Like I said, it's very real. You have to go watch it with an open mind, because if you go there thinking it will suck, you probably wont understand it.I know there are a lot of people who give it one star. It's pretty much a love it or hate it movie. Some people say that the audience was laughing. Simply put, there are a couple very funny parts. Most people like it, those who don't, feel the need to twist everything around. I'm not twisting anything; the people who made the movie intended it to be good, and that's how you have to interpret it.",A History of Violence

I couldn't wait for its release, the trailer was intriguing without giving away too many details, and when I finally saw it I'm sure that my mouth was sitting wide open. From the moment the movie opened it was spectacular. I have seen a few other Cronenberg films and this may be his masterpiece. He steps out of his usual self to create what is simply put a masterpiece of the cinema. This film will easily be up for Best Picture, receiving almost unbelievable critical appraise for it. I strongly recommend everyone see this film for the sheer performances of the all the cast members. They are amazing and a true revelation, showing that there will always be hope for the cinema during a time when audiences rush to disasters like ""Waiting"". Like I said, rush to your local theater and see this movie on the big screen, you won't be disappointed!Note: To those easily offended by sexuality, there is some in the film that stands a purpose but may go a little farther than you would think.

The husband starts smacking around his wife then they continue on to have some pretty violent sex. No good. That pretty much sums up the entire movie in fact. I think the idea for the story behind the movie was good and the previews are pretty misleading. Cute family, little town, bad guys. They just pulled off a story that was intense in an uncomfortable way, kinda made you shift around in your seat kind of movie.

998,CineVeritas,I would've paid more to see this film.,9,7 October 2005,"David Cronenberg's 'A History of Violence' is definitely worth the trip to the theater no matter what the ticket prices are. Viggo Mortenson plays Tom Stall, a rural Indiana diner owner who sky rockets to local heroism when he saves the life of one of his employees by cold-bloodedly killing two potential robbers/murderers. A press storm results in his face being broadcast via local newspapers and national news drawing the attention of Philadelphia mob boss Carl Fogarty, masterfully played by Ed Harris, who believes that Tom is in fact Joey Cusack an ex-mobster in the witness protection program. During the screen time shared with Harris, Mortenson's ability to play a character with a deep internal struggle truly shines. After several encounters, the two have a stand-off involving Tom's son Jack, played by Ashton Holmes. Ultimately, Tom must go to Philadelphia to confront Richie Cusack (William Hurt) and somehow put an end to the harassment of his family. One sub-plot worth mention include; the tension that builds in the relationship between Tom and his wife Edie (Maria Bello) which culminates in a raw, violent sex act on a wooden staircase. Finally, the violent moments in the film are extraordinarily raw and powerful. The brutality, while shocking, really makes tom Stall's character all the more intriguing. Is he Joey Cusack or is it all just a mistake?",A History of Violence
999,Lawret,Thrilling,7,10 November 2005,"Exciting, but two flaws, one minor, one major. The minor flaw is that the clock atop the post office always reads the same time, night or day.

Even Philadelphia cops are not so inert to blink at 4-5 homicides.

I'm sure there are people more educated in the arts than I am that would categorize this movie as ground-breaking and unique. To me it seemed like long periods of extreme boredom punctuated by extreme violence and gore. Now, don't get me wrong, the action sequences were outstanding. The problem was they were too few and far between. I have heard it said that the movie was intended to be more realistic, which is fine, but it was not as entertaining to me that way. In my opinion there was entirely too much just panning the camera around the room and looking at people's faces who were doing nothing.

I gave it 5 out of ten as I thought the acting was superb and the scenes of violence kept you on the edge of your seat, hitting you with that punch in the stomach feeling when they were over. Viggo Mortensen and Maria Bello give stellar performances as the husband and wife who play off of each other as the plot twists and turns.However, I have never been a big fan of movies where the director spends so much time ""painting the canvass"" of the story that he forgets that people's interests lag as the plot sags ( see Kramer's Eyes Wide Shut).Alfred Hitchcock always said that there is no suspense in a gunshot, but rather in the buildup to the gunshot. Cronenburg seems to take the other point of view playing up the gunshot angle and not creating enough suspense before it happens.

Would have liked William Hurt's character involved a little more. Some may find the sex scenes a bit over the top, but I think they add to the feel of darkness brought on by the violent undertones of a bottled up past. I would definitely recommend this film to be viewed. Don't watch this film. Feel it. Perhaps watch something else of Cronenberg before you watch this one. It'll help set the mood. Any other director may have ruined this story. Yet Cronenberg seems to be able to take an off-beat plot and form it into art. It can't be easy. Perhaps Scorcese could pull this one off. I don't know.

Mortenson's performance was stellar, Maria Bello's was also very strong.

It was a compact movie, uncluttered with confusing sub-plots. The sex was graphic, but really an expression of love and passion in the context of marriage, which made it beautiful instead of tawdry. The violence was done in the name of self defense and therefore excusable. Viggo Mortensen exhibited his superb acting ability when you could see him switch from being Tom to being Joey when it was warranted.

The violence is harrowing but extremely realistic and entertaining and the sex scenes are extraordinary and in keeping with the overall tone of the movie.

The trailers looked great. Unfortunately, it rang so profoundly false I just couldn't suspend enough believe to enjoy it. Tom Stall (Viggo) was a ruthless, accomplished and notorious killer, what, 20 years ago? When he was what, 20-25 years old? And now after 20 years, after spending two decades reinventing himself as a mild-mannered café owner in Indiana, he hasn't lost even a foot off his fast ball? Still extremely adept at handling weapons and is a skilled hand-to-hand fighter with lightning-like reflexes and instincts? No back story as an ex-Navy SEAL? Nothing. And his son, a classic high school wimp, does a total reversal by not only kicking the school bully's ass but the bully's two buddies as well. Not just by grit and determination but through accomplished Ninja-like fight moves. Give me a very large break.The daughter was a little freaky too with her dark eye-brows and obviously bleached blonde hair. She looked a little bit like a miniature hooker. Not one member of the entire Stall family rang true...not even Maria Bello who was unable to demonstrate even a scintilla of chemistry with Viggo. The only mitigating performance was by William Hurt, cast entirely against type, as Tom's mobster brother. I'm afraid my recommendation must be to skip this one entirely.

The violence and sex were gratuitous, but thankfully they didn't dwell too long on the gory scenes. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the sex scenes. Our audience laughed a lot in this movie, and though some scenes were supposed to be funny, I'm quite sure many of them weren't meant to be.

I still haven't quite decided which.After a promising start you are assaulted with cliché after cliché. They found the absolute worst child actors on the planet. The movie has the feeling that it was intended to be a lot longer, but got mangled in editing. Characters that seem like they are supposed to be major supporting characters are often just forgotten. Whole plot-lines that seemed promising were either cut off prematurely or abandoned entirely. There are also scenes that appear to have been part of something bigger, but as it is now makes absolutely no sense in the context of the rest of the film. Imagine if a tennis player ran out on to the field during a professional football game, served a ball, then ran off the field with no explanation as to who or why. Now imagine that the coaches, players and referees just continued on playing the game like nothing had ever happened. Like nobody seemed to notice that tennis player. Thats the feeling you get frequently while watching this movie.The movie does however have value as a comedy. It's one of the films that are so stunningly bad that you can't help but laugh at it. You will laugh at the children. You will laugh at the sex scenes. You will laugh at the violent scenes. You will laugh at the credits. I honestly haven't seen a movie this bad in a long time, but I also don't think I have ever had as enriching a movie 'experience' in years. The entire theater was howling. Nobody could hold it in. It was that bad. Total strangers were slapping each other on the arm and high-fiving. We were in tears with laughter.

A lot of dead silence. I feel that the connection between husband and wife didn't seem realistic. I feel that Viggo did the best he could have with what he had to play with. I feel that this film should NOT have been made yet. It wasn't ready. Needed to go back to the drawing board and have a few more twists.

Unfortunately, for me, the movie advanced through its paces so slowly that somehow the ""suspense"" was mostly neutralized. I know this sounds strange, but just like a good comic has a great sense of timing, so must a movie. And this one just took far too long to get from scene to scene.A couple of times during the film my wife and I actually made comments that we ""hoped it would hurry and get to the good part"", but it never did.

The Director knew how to get the actors to integrate their own HISTORIES in this experience. I had the feeling Viggo Mortensen wasn't acting but maybe ""acting out"" his own contained violence. The story shows us that our history or past can never really disappear. It may be suppressed or repressed with a ""new"" identity made available to overlap the former, but it's only skin deep. Like father like son is also made evident and one wonders how much of our violence is learned or innate. Is it genetically passed on to our children? The name, Tom Stall, whether consciously or unconsciously chosen was appropriate because our ""hero"" 's life was put on hold until an unexpected catalyst brought back instinct; not rationality. Could someone have reasoned with Foggarty or Ritchie? This movie is also about instincts and morality. Could Tom or Joey's behavior be defended in court? Is he guilty of a crime, conditioning, acting in self-defense, living catharsis? Was he a liar? As Jungian psychologist and very much interested in the individuation process and one's search for Self identity, I wonder who was this man: Cussak or Stall? Regardless of who he thought he was, he showed us how we need to love and be loved; to be invested with an identity within a community and a family: to be someone for somebody. It shows us that with and in love, a history of violence can be relegated to the past: not to be forgotten but to be forgiven. I think that's why the children, starting with the youngest reinvested or reinstated him at the table where sharing bread can help create communion...with others and within self. This divided character was striving to be an individual; that is an undivided person...Great movie we'll be talking about for a long time.

I have read numerous comments regarding its pace. I think Cronenburg deliberately made the film slow in order to show how slow and boring life is in a small town. The action sequences were short and sweet, loud and very violent, showing the impact on its audience as it would do to a small town. Notice how the pace builds when Joey leaves the town for Philly. I have also heard people complain that we did not know why Joey left his life of crime. This is a story of Tom stall not Joey Cusack, sorry forgot the last name. If we wanted to know why he left that would open up a whole new film showing how Joey took Carls eye disappeared and tried to bury his demons and transform into Tom Stall. The story we are looking at is past demons catching up with a seemingly ordinary guy and the strains it puts on his family. People have also stated that there are some unnecessary sex scenes. The beginning one was very slow and showed two people very much in love. The second when Ede knows the truth is a lot more violent, its like Ede is having a one night stand with a totally different person and gangster hence the reason the sex is a lot more violent. Both of them showing that they have that aggressive streak inside them. Thought all performances were great Mortensen did have me believing he wasn't Joey, Edf Harris was great I hoped he lasted longer, Bello was probably the best performer she did angry, stricken, worried, sad greatly. The only one performer I felt was miscast was William hurt as Ritchie. Overall I enjoyed this film for every slightly boring bit you was greeted with a horrible act of violence this film was named perfectly. This is my first ever post so I hope i have not offended anyone just wanted to give you my interpretation. There is no film out there that everyone will enjoy.",A History of Violence
1017,kinetickaty,Porno with no plot,2,28 September 2005,"I used to be a Viggo Mortensen fan, but not after his latest choice of film. I had the misfortune of seeing a sneak preview of ""A History of Violence,"" starring Mortensen, Ed Harris, William Hurt and Maria Bello, which was hosted by the Nashville Film Club in Nashville, Tennessee. I looked forward to seeing what looked to be a thriller about a mid-western man's dirty past coming back to haunt him. What I saw was something far more sexually explicit than any R-rated movie I've seen to date. It was just one camera angle away from pornographic. And what's worse, none of the drawn-out ""love scenes"" had anything to do with the plot! That's not unusual for a typical movie these days, but I'm more concerned with how lax the R-rating seems to be getting. This movie is X-rated. No question. Please be warned that your eye will catch more of the actors' bodies than your mind will plot. If for no other reason, don't waste your money on this movie because of the unimaginative, slow-moving, downright boring storyline. My husband and I walked out of the theater half-way through the movie out of disgust and boredom. I'm not trying to start a boycott, I just know how I always appreciate reading honest reviews from other viewers. Apparently, one cannot trust the system to rate movies correctly anymore.",A History of Violence
1018,kauffmanphil,Subjective Interpretation(and there isn't a right one....Trust Me),7,30 September 2005,"Misunderstanding this film as an attempt to curb any sort of trend Hollywood has been rooted in, pertaining to violence, is inaccurate. The mere fact that the movie has grotesque scenes of violence seems to very obviously project to me that Cronenberg doesn't necessarily want to curb any sort of violence in movies. Aside from my opinion about it, Mr. Cronenberg stated himself on the radio, that it's in no way an attempt to counteract the violence depicted in movies. Did I just repeat myself? Yes, I did. It would be better to have violence in movies if can be some sort of visual warning as to what happens if you did consider acting on your violent tendencies, if you happen to have them.What is very compelling is Viggo Mortensen's character. Many people look down on small town people, but simplicity is beautiful. Ask yourself if you would be happy if you had the life of Jack Stall or Edie Stall after you watch the movie.And don't look down on cheering for the ""good guy"", after all what would you do if someone pointed a .357 in your face? Try to reason with them? Well, good luck, hope you have some money tucked away for funeral costs. Then again who cares about money after their dead? By the way, don't over-analyze the movie. Unless you speak to the director, and we all know he's probably too full of himself to talk to any of us non-Hollywood peons, you'll never know all the messages he was trying to convey.

I can understand it in the heat of passion, but not where it was. The ending sucked as well. The other movie goers were like "" thats it "". Wait until it is on hbo. Not worth even the rental fee.

They have so much magnetism that they do not even have to talk, especially Viggo, to carry the film. Ed Harris was terrific as was William Hurt. Even the Indiana sheriff was great.Their son, played by Ashton Holmes, had a very demanding secondary role and carried it off very brilliantly.I seriously think this film could be a serious Oscar contender.

Boring, long at 96 or 98 minutes, no psychological tension -- nothing. Gratuitous sex (and I'm no prude) and awkwardly placed scenes that, I suppose, were needed to drive the plot but the plot needed to be driven a hell of a lot faster than it was.

1025,superturtle-1,"Don't know if any of this is considered a spoiler, but just in case...",8,1 October 2005,"""A History of Violence"" takes audiences through the compelling history that one man has with crime, in turn leaving viewers with a history of violence to call their own.We meet the average small-town family headed by the average small-town man, Tom Stall (played by Viggo Mortensen). When confronted with a gunpoint robbery in his hometown of Milbrook, Indiana, Stall displays remarkable reactionary skills and impresses the town with his heroism. Now Stall finds himself face-to-face with east coast mobsters and is forced to relive a past he believed to have left forever.The movie starts out considerably slow and ends with little resolution. The actual plot doesn't begin until a good five, 10 minutes into the film after we are confronted with two minor characters that have a seemingless pointless exchange. We are then taken through a highly dramatic sequence of events that leads to an exciting climax, but then are left short of any sort of resolution. There are two silent acts that take place towards the end of the film that can symbolically hint to the audience what the conclusion may be, but that doesn't seem to be enough. Sequel, anyone? Perhaps.By the name alone, this movie was to be expected to be laden with gore upon gore, however the movie also carries another element commonly associated with an R rating: sex and nudity. The sex scenes hold little inhibition- we are confronted with two noteworthy sexual encounters between the two married characters, one involving a cheerleading outfit, and the other involving a hallway almost-rape. In the course of the film, we are also confronted with a full male back view and a full female frontal view. This, along with the violence, is not something you will want to bring your parents to see.The gore was prevalent, but the bloody effects weren't always as realistic. Minor injuries looked convincing; a scratch, a scar, a choke mark. Major injuries, however, weren't as believable. Maybe it was just that the gun shot face looked too much like Halloween make-up and the bullet to the head looked too obviously placed post-production.Where injuries faltered, however, some noteworthy cinematography made up. Conversations were sometimes exchanged between the two main characters in a nighttime bedroom where the color scheme included only blue and back, and audiences are left to make out only the outlines of the two bodies. The use of silence was valuable in these scenes as well, as in turn the audience is forced to pay attention to the dialogue rather than the visuals or background sounds alone.The acting was above par, especially with a little known cast. Mortensen's portrayal of Tom was uncanny, despite the complexities that character arises. Mortensen was able to play all facets Tom demanded, whether that be perfectly happy small-town man, murderer, or who Tom was in his past. An Oscar- deserving performance if there ever was one.His wife Edie, played by Maria Bello, was exceptional as well, but not on the same level as Mortensen. Bello was able to nail of her character's facets, but a terribly fake cry can do damage to one's overall performance.""A History of Violence"" earns four out of five stars for its compelling plot and good performances, however improvement can be made in special effects and conclusion.",A History of Violence
1026,jlyiv,Worst movie ever,1,2 October 2005,"How the hell do people like this movie? The previews looked interesting and I'd read some good reviews going into it, so I was completely disappointed with what was definitely the most PONDEROUS, TEDIOUS, and ASSENINE movie I've ever seen. Even my wife, who rarely dislikes any movie thought it was the worst movie she'd ever seen. At the end of the movie, the entire audience just laughed, and I, for the first time in my life, blurted out ""THAT SUCKED!"" It's two days later and I'm still mad about how terrible this movie was. I swear to God, the film was written and directed by the writers and directors of ""Saved By The Bell"", who were trying to combine a David Lynch paced film with the witticisms and brief violence of ""Lethal Weapon"".The dialogue. My sweet lord, the idiotic dialogue. The characters. My sweet lord, the two-dimensional, stiffly-acted, self-serving characters. The school bully?? What kind of retard thought of that character? Who didn't see his ass-whooping coming? The reporter ""interview"" when Tom came home from the hospital? What the hell was that??? The opening scene with the family in the daughter's bed? The beyond tedious ending! The endless scenes with nothing happening! It wasn't suspenseful - it was freaking ponderous! Since when did the mafia consist of all non-Italians? Since when do teenagers sit outside a post office on a busy street corner smoking weed without even trying to hide it? One sheriff half-assedly investigates five murders? Since when did mullets come back into style? Even the little things like background action where half-assed. The first scene with Ed Harris in the diner, none of the background actors are even pretending to talk to each other and there's virtually no background noise at all in this crowded diner. The scene where Tom runs several miles on a bad foot in a blind panic, walks through the door, and doesn't have a drop of sweat on him. And later in the same scene, his son says ""Dad, you're sweating"" and there STILL wasn't any sweat on him.And a note to the family that brought their three elementary school aged daughters to the movie and let them watch the graphic oral sex, stairway sex, and violence  thanks for making the only potentially enjoyable parts of the movie incredibly awkward.

There is no way the critics could have given this movie good reviews without being handed a fat brown envelope under table first. Don't waste your time or money, here's why:1. The first fifteen minutes (and introduction to the first two characters who quickly die) are unnecessary. Time would have been better spent developing relationships between the main characters...or better yet, giving us a REAL ending. 2. Poignant scenes, such as the meeting of the brothers, should have been intense, serious scenes; however, the audience was laughing because the dialog and acting were terrible. In fact, this theme continued throughout the entire movie...should we laugh or cry?3. Because my time is better spent doing something else, like watching my grass grow, I will not dwell on all of the many the bad parts of this movie, but I will say this final remark...sex scenes between middle-aged adults are fine if they are done in good taste, but when they are not it repulses the majority of the audience.

At least, I didn't think it could be as bad as it actually was. And it wasn't the fault of the actors; the script was so corny, everything seemed forced. Nothing was natural, rather you felt that the director was force feeding you what he wanted you to think. Yes, Viggo's character, Tom Stall, was a loving, caring, regular family man with a strong family. But in the scene introducing the family, we get the young daughter screaming, waking up from a nightmare. Viggo runs in to see what's the matter, but, that's not enough. Next, the teenage brother runs in to see what happened to his sister, and finally we meet the mother, Maria Bello. Everybody is so concerned and it is so tender and caring and so horribly over the top. What family is like that? Yes, we understand, all too painfully, that this is a close, loving, gentle, caring family. But it makes me hate every single one of them, and I really hate the director because I am not able to forget that I am, indeed, watching a movie. The forced script and direction makes it impossible to suspend your disbelief. This runs through the entire movie. The sex scenes were particularly forced, unbelievable and uncomfortable to watch.

I'm not sure who goofed in this film - because I have a hard time believing some of these actors would have been involved in this project had they known the outcome.

That's when you can forgive the good actors for accepting a role that didn't turn out to be what it could have been. What I am asking is, why are all those well respected actors just lying to themselves and Cronenberg? They surely must have seen from the script they were handed that this movie was absolutely undeserving of being made. This film could NOT have looked good, not even on paper.

What it seemed to me was David Cronenberg liked the story, wanted to throw in some gore and sex, and added some long shots for a nice artsy feel so the audience knows this isn't your typical visceral summer shoot-em-up.The sex scenes, for that matter, seemed gratuitous. I don't care who the director is, or how quirky or unique their representation of sex has been in the past. When most the audience is shrugging their shoulders and laughing uncomfortably with audible gasps of ""What?"" something went wrong. The scenes didn't add anything to the characters or the plot and could have easily been thrown away.The blood and gore were all well and good, but also a bit too much. Being able to see into the sinus cavities of a victim or seeing their teeth through a torn open cheek allow you to see the damage inflicted, but this in no way informed you of the consequences to the protagonist or anything else of merit.Finally, the movie just had terrible third act problems. Tom and his family were left in exact same position at the end of the movie as when he first got rid of Ed Harris' character... mending family, dead baddies, etc. The audience was not even aware of any danger of his brother until the phone call, at which point the movie could have ended without a fancy Philidelphia shoot-out.All in all, I am glad I got in for free and would merely recommend this to Cronenberg fans, because it seems they at lease would be able to make some excuses.",A History of Violence

The viewer knows who's side he (or she) is on, but is not always quite sure whether it is the right judgement to make.In some ways, it touches upon the theme addressed in ""Clockwork Orange"", i.e. the impossibility of completely repressing an individual's true nature and takes it a step further by involving the lead character's son into the equation. At the same time, there is no resemblance to Kubrick's masterpiece, whether in the storyline or practically anything else.In fact the plot is very simple: family man Tom Stall (an outstanding Viggo Mortensen) kills two criminals in self-defence one night while he is about to close his small-town diner and suddenly becomes a local hero. From then on, the whole movie is the resolution of a case of mistaken identity, that will change Tom's life (and his family's) forever.The movie is perfectly paced, with great performances all round, a tight script and a score that supports the tension in an unexpected manner. It is indeed a violent movie, although much less gratuitously so than most of the stuff that's around, particularly because this is no ""cartoon violence"" - this is real, vicious and its physical consequences are clear, without being dwelled on.Probably the most mature Cronenberg film I've seen to date.",A History of Violence
1043,lisa-khan2,Worst Movie Ever,2,5 October 2005,"I just don't understand how anyone could have possibly enjoyed this film. Even the sex scenes were bad. It was boring. The whole movie I was waiting for something, anything to happen to get me interested to stay until the end of the movie. And then it happened, William Hurt showed up and I thought, ohhhhh okay well maybe something exciting or rivoiting is going to happen. Ten minutes later he died and ten minutes after that, the movie was over. I wanted to leave halfway through but was convinced that since we stayed this long, might as well finish. Even though I considered it the worst movie ever, I gave it a 2 because my life isn't finished yet and there is a chance that I could possibly see something worse.",A History of Violence
1044,cjeffers-1,The only movie I've ever walked out on,1,5 October 2005,"Absolutely the worst dialog I've ever seen, unrealistic characters, gratuitous sex and violence that add nothing to the plot. I tend to see many action/violent type film a la Heat,Gladiator,Taxi, etc...,so I'm not ""anti-violence"" in movies, but this was ridiculous. The actors in the film are top notch, Ed Harris is one of my favorites, but even Hurt,Harris, and Mortensen cannot save this terrible film.Even the music score was subpar. My girlfriend was asking to leave after the first 45 minutes. By the time I left most of the audience was laughing at the dialog. I've had kidney stones that were less painful than this film. Whoever wrote that glowing review above must be one of the writers or on crack.",A History of Violence
1045,macca186,Another winner for Cronenberg.,9,9 October 2005,"Having seen the trailer for this film I had no clue what to expect but, coming from Cronenberg, I expected nothing but the best.The pleasant surprise was that, come halfway through the film, I still didn't know what to expect. The chopping and changing between quiet, thought provoking film and over the top, yet still, strangely, incredibly believable action really kept you guessing as to Stall's real past. In terms of the violence, it was exactly what I'd expect from Cronenberg. If somebody's face gets blown off you see somebody's face get blown clean off. Simple as that.Given the nature of the film, I was sceptical as to whether Cronenberg's characteristic style would fit but I am pleased to say it did the job nicely. Easily vile enough to make the more squeamish among you cringe, but still in strange moderation. It was extreme but only when it should be.Some superb performances really compliment the fantastic direction. Viggo Mortensen's Tom Stall was a perfect rendition of the quiet hero. The character was still brought to life fantastically despite the incredibly minimal dialogue and this quieter protagonist really helped to keep the character real. At totally the other end of the spectrum, William Hurt's portrayal of Richie Cusack was, in Hurt's usual style, a work of highly conceptual genius. Obvious fully into his role and happy to take it to it's limits, Hurt manages to provide an entertaining and yet, simultaneously, chilling enemy for his short spell of the film.All in all, ""A History of Violence"" is superb. The incredibly effective blend of slow-moving, thoughtful scenes and Cronenberg's token violence makes this easily the best thriller this year and one which deserves it's place in the movie Hall of Fame for years to come.",A History of Violence
1046,SeriousCarl,"Gratuitous violence and full frontal nudity, what more could you ask for?",7,5 October 2005,"If you go to this movie expecting a really great flick, you will be disappointed, but if you want see some gratuitous violence and a little bit of full frontal nudity, this is the movie for you.Although the plot is a little unbelievable, the movie isn't bad, and the flaws in the plot certainly aren't a show stopper.The action scenes are pretty cool and gory. This guy is like is pretty hard core, and it is great to see that one hit just isn't enough in some situations.The acting is believable, but a little unnatural from time to time. The dialogue could use a little work, but it does progress the script and so it fill its requirement.It is a graphic, dirty flick with no stings attached, and overall, I would recommend it.",A History of Violence

The group I saw it with and I all agree that it deserves between a 2 and a 3. I could see someone giving it a 5 or 6, but no more. And I can honestly say that the movie gets worse the more you think about it after seeing it. The lacking dialogue, the predictable storyline, the characters who seem to be intended as so non-cliché that they're cliché. And what's with th 'rape-turned-love' scene? HE HAD HIS HAND AROUND HER THROAT, AND IT TURNED INTO PASSIONATE LOVE. What is that!? The ending isn't all that much better, either, and neither are the very clearly fake tears that Maria Bello exhibits. And the baptism-thing? Are you seriously going to tell me that a man will walk out of a sixteen-story bathroom to go and wash his face in a lake!? My overall review, don't see the movie.",A History of Violence

The ""love"" scenes went a little too far for my taste, but the fight sequences were pretty good. Many parts of the movie did not make sense because they were overdone, overacted, or just plain unreasonable. Some example scenes include the hospital barf scene (which made me and my wife laugh), high school bully hallway confrontation (of Revenge of the Nerds grandeur), in person conversation with brother, and post fight cleanup at the lake. I'm trying to be as vague as possible, but you'll know what I'm referring to if you see the movie.

However there is a scene in this film, which competes for shock value. This film delivered it's storyline with subversive wit as well as stylish aplomb, the fast violence in contrast to the slow moving pace of life in small town Mid west. Yet the most intriguing part of this movie is the poignant ending, it leaves you knowing that violence is wholly acceptable in American culture yet wondering is it really?... Without being a spoiler you will have to watch the film to understand. A fantastic performance by all cast members in particular Ed Harris and Viggo, the tension is well crafted and as expected of Cronenberg their are scenes that may cause controversy in particular the sex scene on the stairs, which I believe was integral part of the film as it reflects the complexity of the main characters relationship.",A History of Violence
1050,ubikwitousninja,It will be a long time until I see a worse movie . . .,2,8 October 2005,"POSSIBLE SPOILER IN HERE ON A COUPLE OF MINOR PLOT POINTS!This movie blew chunks. Straight up. Anyone that thought they liked are the kind of people that analyze poems and paintings and find symbolism in the most inane things. I'm not going to waste too much time, but this movie was so bad that I feel it is my duty to spare future viewers a waste of 2 hours and 8 bucks.The acting was absolutely terrible. The mother, daughter (can't give her too much flak seeing as she is so young), and particularly the son were some of the worst actors I'e seen playing relatively major roles in a major motion picture. William Hurt pulls a standard move for his characters and tries valiantly to overplay his role. It's terrible.Some plot points actually make no sense what-so-ever. Take the scene with the retarded (he's not really retarded) son who catches the stud's fly ball to win the game and then is almost beaten up for it. For starters who, in high school, says ""Think you're a big bad-a** cause you caught that fly ball huh f@gg0t (can't post the real spelling of the word)?"" Completely fictional situation. Oh yeah, and did I mention it HAS NO Relevance TO THE STORY AT ALL! Yeah, I said it. It really doesn't affect a stinking thing. Man I'm ticked.There is one completely unnecessary sex scene that takes place on the stairs, that takes too long even though it's in there. Neither of them were tastefully done.The plot couldn't be more predictableViggo Mortenson's character is terribly bland which doesn't allow him to act to his potential in the slightest (not to mention the character is lame).Has one of the most INSANELY RETARDED ENDINGS EVER!. This is the kind of ending where the sweaty dude in his apartment that wrote it was probably snickering to himself thinking he was just the most bad-a** writer ever, leaving the audience hanging like that.Enough of that. This is a bad movie, you will vaguely be entertained at best (I personally recommend you sleep through it). Just to let you readers know, I know a HECK of a lot about movies and what makes them good. And this one is probably the worst movie I seen that was intended to be taken seriously in several years. Feel free to ignore me, but you will agree after that two hour gulag.Bu Radlee",A History of Violence

It was very slow in the beginning and the scene in the office was predictable and it was annoying to have to wait for that. If the movie was making fun of movies that do that, well, ha ha. 2. The whole cheerleader fantasy sex thing. He knew she was going to pick him up after work, but he acted like it was a big surprise when he came out. And what was the deal with the big build up like she was going to have a donkey show or something and then she's just wearing a cheerleader costume? 3.The two people fighting and then getting hot and having sex? That is not real life. When you fight, you hate the other person and find them repulsive, especially if you are married to them. 4.The kid has a bad dream and dad comes in the room first, then the brother and then the mother last? The best case scenario would be the husband groggily nudging mom to wake her up. 5.The husband trying to outrun the car to protect his wife? If he could call his wife, why not call the police too? No more minutes? She could have called as well, since they are so first-name-basis. 6.The truck is barely working, but it gets him all the way to Philly? 7. What's up with the name, Stall, or however it is spelled? Is that supposed to be funny because the truck stalls? And what's that about that name being available? That shouldn't be one of my top ten, since it's no big deal.8. I didn't like the guy, so I didn't really care what happened to him or if he got any meatloaf or not.9.It took too long to give him the meatloaf. Also, it was unclear whether or not it was meatloaf.

How about from the beginning! If it weren't for the gratuitous sex and excellent violence, this movie would get NEGATIVE 10. The acting was horrible and the plot even worse. Talk about throwing sh*t at the wall and hoping that it sticks, that movie was just that, SH*T and unfortunately for moviegoers like myself it stuck, or excuse me STUNK! Viggo, how can you go from doing so well with the LOTR's to taking on this pathetic excuse for a movie? I wouldn't be surprised if he and every other cast member are blacklisted and never offered a decent role again.Maria Bello, I must admit it was nice seeing your bush on the big screen, it was almost like you had Buckwheat in a leg lock and let's not forget the scene where you and Viggo demonstrate, needlessly might I add, how well and quick the two of you can engage in some 69 action. Oh and one more, lets not forget the violent sex/rape scene on the stairs, classic! If this movie had one thing going for it, it would have been the violence. The violent scenes are incredible, and I will admit the sex scenes were great too. However you take them out of the equation and you have NOTHING! Correction, you do have one thing, Ed Harris and his cronies rolling up in a tight Chrysler 300 Hemi, NICE CAR!",A History of Violence

I walked into the theatre expecting a good movie, a thriller, a movie that would leave things to my imagination.A History of Violence has left me shocked and angry. I'm angry I paid money for it and shocked no one left the theatre. I'm angry I didn't leave the theatre.This movie is a blatant attack on human dignity. This is not a film about reconciliation or conversion or on making things right.It's about graphic violence, degrading sex and vicious murder for those things in themselves.There was no point to this movie; no moral contained in the story.No, this was a film that ironically followed a public service ad from the Province of Ontario stating, ""If teens see smoking in films, they will probably want to smoke too..."" What happens when they see violent rape and murder scenes? I am only left to ponder...",A History of Violence
1054,k-kisin,"badly made, shallow and simply awful",1,9 October 2005,"This is possibly the worst film I have ever seen. Couple gratuitous sex and violence with a weak and illogical plot, unrealistic characters and poor directing and you start to get the idea.First of all the film is SLOOOOOOOOOOOOW. The first (totally irrelevant) scene takes 10 minutes. At that point you're starting to believe that the characters being developed in this scene are very important only to see them for a whole 2 more minutes during the whole film.The movie then spends a good half an hour showing us the Stall family in all it's averageness. OK, they're normal people...we get the idea. I could even see the reason for the first sex scene although it was bordering on uncomfortable.At this stage you're thinking ""OK, it's slow but something is going to happen now and the movie will take off"" and you're not disappointed by the diner scene although I didn't particularly want to see inside the bad guy's head. So, right, NOW the movie is going to start! Unfortunately, the only suspense you get from this point on is in waiting for something worthwhile to happen. As much as I love Ed Harris his character was unbelievably unrealistic (I mean, if someone nearly took your eye out with some barbed wire, surely you wouldn't go round to their diner for a chat - you'd hit them on the head with something hard and then take them to your boss instead of politely asking them to come after stalking their wife). After this the film goes downhill at increasing speed with completely pointless characters (like Stall's son, the local sheriff etc) being involved when they are quite irrelevant. The shockingly gratuitous sex scene on the stairs (I'd like to see the director actually try having sex like that in real life) which has no meaning sums it up quite well.The scene in Phily is linear beyond belief leaving a huge number of things unexplored seemingly substituting information with a pile of corpses while the ending itself is inconclusive at best.What have I learned from the film? Umm, just 2 things - don't believe reviews and don't see Cronenberg's films.",A History of Violence
1055,karri_p,Captures the intensity of emotion in that kind of violence,10,9 October 2005,I thought History of Violence was an excellent movie--anyone who has ever had the displeasure of going through violent events could identify with the tough emotions shown in the film--it wasn't over played--events that were difficult to process like murder/killing showed appropriate shock and after emotional effects.I will definitely be seeing it again. Viggo is as consistent as ever. This and his work in Hidalgo as Frank Hopkins witnessing the killings at Wounded Knee were really very appropriate reactions to traumatic events. He seems to have mastered the art of understatement that is similar to the reactions you produce when you go through hugely bad things in real life.,A History of Violence
1056,jlee1784,i don't know what you're talking about,8,9 October 2005,"I have no idea what the first guy that commented was thinking. Think about it. This was a 1:30 long movie that felt like 2:00 long. That's probably why the first guy commented so bad.You're not supposed to observe Ashton Holmes' acting abilities and judge them. I would understand if you wanted to claim that Viggo Mortensen's acting wasn't so top notch (which it was pretty damn good for the movie) but I could honestly care less about Ashton Holme's acting. He's not as big as Viggo is, so he's basically there to act like a scared individual that suddenly turns into someone similar to his father's past.Those of you who want to believe this film doesn't take the action as far as you wanted, well you know what? It's not supposed to. It keeps it at a limit and stops there which is great for the movie. I probably would've been disappointed if I were laughing at the action scenes because they were so amazing. No, instead I laughed because of the ""Oh sh-t!"" factor. The action scenes were supposed to make the audience think ""omg, i can't believe that just happened? did that happen?"" Look back at this film and ask yourself if every scene was important to the plot of the film. In my view, yes they all were. The way the director portrays this film to real life is as real as it gets.So, for those of you who watch this movie thinking it will keep you on your toes at all times, well, you don't have the right attitude.

Once this poorly crafted tale began to meander through the early family bonding, I began to realize that what should have been entertainment was starting a long nights journey into a daze. I will not reveal any important plot lines.....there are not any to reveal. The film moves from one situation to another, weakly linked by some sort of historical thread. Teen age boys will find it great fun. Murder, fights in school and full frontal nudity from a Sharon (you haven't seen my pubic hair since the nineties) Stone look alike. From the strange interaction featured in the previews to Ms Stone look a like humping on a staircase like a woman possessed, this film not only left me cold.

I don't know I think something was missing and I just cant put my finger on it.Do real couples after so many years make love like that?

The acting was pretty good I do think that it was very entertaining and the plot was excellent it was all the sex and the ending that was very disappointing. I also think they give away pretty much the whole movie early into it so for the rest of the movie you pretty much know what will happen and not so exciting anymore.

1061,ihinds,"Great actors, bad movie.",1,10 October 2005,"I've seen Viggo Mortenson and Ed Harris playing stellar movie roles so their talent isn't a matter of question. The storyline was sluggish and had all the vigor and movement of a pool of sludge. I won't discuss the plot, because it was nonexistent. To sum it up the failure of this movie to engage and entertain can be blamed on the writing. It was unfortunate that the considerable talent of Mr. Mortenson and Mr. Harris still weren't enough to make this lame duck fly. The sex scenes themselves added nothing to the content of the movie, and tended to add confusion to the issues. I can say though that while the sex scenes where unnecessary it was a pleasant change to actually have those engaged in the act be married. The violence in and of itself can't be new and startling to those who watch any movies at all. If it was the change, from milk bland Tom to Ex-Mobster, that was supposed to be a revealing turning point in the film it too failed to expose any real content in the character or storyline. And the ending... I'm sure it was supposed to be one of those poignant silences that are supposed to highlight the torn battle victims of the human conflict, but all it managed to do is make you waste another 30 seconds or so that would be better served preparing microwave popcorn. The absolute best this movie has to offer is the talents Viggo Mortenson and Ed Harris, but even that too gets lost in the urge to get up and walk away.",A History of Violence

She claims to have slept with the guy on five separate occasions, but her brain can no longer cope with the effects of the cocktail of psychedelic sedatives that she imbibes on a daily basis in her cliff top home near Cape Wrath, so I'd be sceptical about that one.Cronenberg really ramps things up a gear with his latest offering.

However,the most disconcerting part of the movie was the use of marital violence and violent sex as a means of resolving conflict in the relationship. It's not surprising that the highest ratings were received by males under 18; the gratuitous violence would be appealing to that demographic. However, it also means that very demographic has been exposed to a justification for using sexual violence against women when emotional conflict arises in a relationship.Poor judgement on the part of the producers, writers, and director.

The violence was the highlight of the film and was graphically brilliant and the sex scenes were vividly great yet meaningless to the plot. Yet, the ending was utterly ridiculous. If it weren't for the ending this movie would of instantly become a classic. The ending was sooo bad that when it ended the whole theater broke out in laughter.

(similar to the way Sin City was done). However I was horribly disappointed. The plot is only loosely related to the book and actual lines of dialog from the book are rarely used, probably because so many scenes were added that were never in the book. Names are different, ages, and even the number of kids in the main characters' family differ between the book and the movie. Also, roles that people play and major pieces of the plot are completely twisted around. The book also explains much more than the movie ever did. The movie barely explains anything and thus barely ends up resolving anything. On the same note, the ending is horrible in the movie, I was appalled to say the least. Another inconsistency that was particularly disturbing were the number of sex scenes in the movie, whereas nothing in the book is even romantic, much less a sex scene. My favorite scenes from the book were never even mentioned in the movie and the level of violence was toned down a ridiculous amount in the movie. It's called A History of Violence for a reason! - it's supposed to be incredibly violent!! When it all comes down to it, A History of Violence(the book) was undoubtedly one of the best books I have read. It is your average story of a man with a dark past that comes back to haunt him, however it is pulled off so perfectly it is brilliant. I was hoping the movie would leave me with at least somewhat the same impression. Anyone interested in seeing the movie I suggest you buy the graphic novel instead, it's about the same price, shouldn't take you much longer to read than to watch the movie, and above all it's a million times better.",A History of Violence

Maria Bello was pretty decent, she seems to do well as hormone loaded wife/lover of tough guys (Payback 1999 w/ Mel Gibson), the hot sex scenes, etc. Ed Harris was OK as the bad guy with the blind eye. Virgo Mortenses doing his usual stuff in a acceptable manner. But the script was poor, dialogs were very basic, brainless, and cheap.

1069,waterloo1410,Why the gratuitous sex?,3,16 October 2005,"I don't understand why the relationship of the husband and wife was debased twice in this movie with the very graphic sex scenes and the full frontal nudity of the wife. The movie begins with a very tender family scene. This lovely glimpse of family interaction in no way carries through as the ""core"" of the film. The sensitive son and adoring wife seem quick to separate themselves from the family unit as the dad is exposed and exposes himself as no stranger to brutality. The violence was rough but somewhat expected because of the title. (Whoever did the special effect makeup must have felt good about their ability to depict destroyed faces.) But the sex scenes were weird and unnecessarily lengthy and ultimately pointless to the story line. The uneven press coverage of the events in the film is somewhat puzzling, but perhaps the editors did not know what to do with that issue. Anyway, what a shame. I feel fooled by the reviews I have read about this movie and cheated out of the money I paid to go to the theater to see it. Waiting this one out for the DVD would have been for the best as you can always switch off the DVD player. My son and I were stuck at a theater miles from home so we sat it out. It was odd walking back to the lobby of the multi-theater movie house with not one word being said by our fellow watchers. I think everyone felt the same way - this movie was shockingly bad.",A History of Violence

That means that every other thriller will be awesome.OK, I'm not going to give a full review being that this is my first. I'd have to say that this is one film that has actors that could be the making of a pretty good movie, but it fell short of it. I haven't read the book, so whether it's a proper adaption of that, I don't know. Truly a film that was not worth my money with so many holes in the story I'd look forward to not watching any of the other films that are written by these writers.

1071,hldempsey,This movie makes me want to give up on cinema altogether!,1,16 October 2005,"I have never before been moved to tell as many people as I possibly can not to go see a movie. I have looked forward to seeing ""A History of Violence"" since I began reading all the good reviews this film has received in the press. Apparently these people were paid well by David Cronenberg.Look up the word gratuitous in the dictionary and you will see the movie poster for this film. There is gratuitous sex, gore, and horrible dialogue. The first 10 minutes of this film are the worst written, acted, and directed 10 minutes ever committed to film, and added absolutely nothing to this movie. What little they were supposed to add could've been addressed in a more appropriate place in a fraction of the time.The usually stunning Maria Bello delivered her lines like a bored production assistant helping a real actor learn her lines, and they could not have made her look worse. The 30-year-old ""kid"" playing her and Viggo Mortensen's son wore more make-up than she did. Morgensen looked confused most of the time, like he was sounding out the words in the script. The two sex scenes between Bello and Morgensen were the most painful things to watch since Extreme Makeover.They looked like two people trying hard to film an amateur soft-core porn film, while having never actually done any of the acts themselves.They looked ridiculous and I was embarrassed for both of them.I am not squeamish in the least (Fight Club is one of my favorite films), but the shock that Cronenberg must have wanted us to feel when he gave us an extreme close-up of the gaping holes in people's heads was only shock at how badly these scenes did not belong in this film. Maybe he thought we would buy into this nonsense if he showed he meant business.The skimpy story outline that tries to pass as a plot is ridiculously transparent. Did the screenwriter get this idea from ""Joe Dirt?"" Needless to say, I won't be adding ""A History of Violence"" to my DVD collection. Although it would be worth the $20 just to be able to run this movie over with my car",A History of Violence
1072,SpoR-One,What the hell?,6,17 October 2005,"I'll start this off with a quote of the previous commenter "" ""A History of Violence"": It is a film which I desperately wish to see again but equally compelling is the urge to never, ever see it again."" ""I would never see this movie again. First of all The characters are boring. There is a 30-40 year old guy and his 2 kids and wife and then he becomes a sort of a town hero, gets on the news and some bad guys from his past come after him. There is no real plot. Basically the movie is 5 minutes of rural farm town livin' Followed up by some killin' them followed up by some more rural farm livin' and then some cheap badly acted sex then some more killin' and then some more farm livin' followed up by some more sex. You see my point? As for the plot (if you can call it one) The bad guys are nice for some reason (wtf?) and the main character isn't really a hero hes just weird. The movie ended with him not really solving his problems. It just sort of leaves you wondering why it was over. I mean, I was in the theatre 20 minutes ago and when the ending scene (which really didn't even make sense) finished, I actually said ""What the Fu**?!"" out loud and everyone laughed and agreed. Vaguest movie i've ever seen.Overall I give the movie a 6 out of 10 though because the violence was very cool and VERY GRAPHIC. The plot sucked, was there even a plot?

It didn't flow and the sex scenes either made you laugh or sit there wondering if the movie had changed. The acting was bad, except for Ed Harris who did a good job. Everyone else looked like they'd never acted before. Its not that the violence and sex scene were dumb, its that they did't go with the rest of the movie. One minute you're watching an action film, the next a porn film and then some kind of romantic movie.

As a group, the main comment made was ""they should refund our money"". I have never been in a movie where the entire audience agreed on how terrible the film was.

Personally, I left the movie theater a bit puzzled and upset. Puzzled due to the abrupt ending and upset because I was unable to secure a refund after sitting through this thing. It really sucked. I mean, the only enjoyment was being able to see the ever HOT Maria Bello on the silver screen. Especially, after the skin show she put on in The Cooler (a good movie by the way). The acting was okay just that I feel that we sorta got to see the extended version of the film (ya know, the version of the film that they added all the scenes that they felt would not fit in and just seem awkward...). In the end, if it was not for the nudity, violence and a few standout performances (Ed Harris and Maria Bello for example) than I would not feel like I have been shoved into a complete state of melancholy.

The question of whether or not crime might pay in the long run and if it might be possible at all to hide from one's past, was very fascinating to me. I did, however, find that it was not answered in a satisfying way at all. The only solution given is to answer violence with violence, words and emotions seem to have no chance against ""actions"" at all...I have to say that I really am disappointed by Cronenberg's title, it does sound a lot more promising than it actually is.",A History of Violence
1077,Rahvin-5,Violence doesn't necessarily make a good movie,5,20 October 2005,"I have read the very excited and positive reviews for ""A History of Violence"" and considered them a recommendation for a very good film. However, when I left the cinema after watching the movie, I was unsatisfied, disappointed and had more questions than answers as well as an uneasy feeling about the way, violence was presented in the movie.The film clearly consists of two parts. The first part portraits the quiet and happy life of Tom Stall, a coffee shop owner in a small American town. His marriage is happy, he has two kids, and it seems like violence is unknown in the Stall family. This changes, when two criminals turn up in the coffee shop after closing time and threaten to rob the shop and kill one of the employees. Tom Stall moves in quickly and kills both of the intruders in a very efficient manner. The audience is thrilled, as it was possible to relate to the nice and normal guy Tom Stall all the way until then. We ask ourselves, how naturally violence can develop even in the most peaceful environment. Suddenly more bad guys spring up out of nowhere, as Tom's face is presented on TV and in the papers, and they obviously believe to know him from way back in the past. Up until now the movie is entertaining, capturing.As light is shed on Tom's past though, the film clearly loses in quality. We learn that he has not always been such a nice guy, that his life, his family is based on a lie, unfinished business from the past. In order to protect his family, he resorts to violence and from here until the end it is all about self justice with unconscious humour. What begins as a parable to modern America turns into a self-justice ""Dirty Harry""-like film with an overall disappointing plot. Whoever thinks it easy to follow the motivations of the characters from now on, should explain them to me. Why did Tom's son suddenly become violent as well? Why did his wife actually have sex with him, after she had found out the truth? Is it this easy and graphic: Sex and violence fit together? Why does he have to go back to Philadelphia and ""sort things out""? How can his family accept him afterwards, and why? The thing that really put me off was the way, how violence was presented throughout the movie. It is no splatter movie, but it is shown the way it really is: Blood, shattered bones, exploded skulls. In the beginning this seems to fit in, a clear opposite to the way the family and their life is being shown. But as the film loses its genuine irony and appeal, the violence without any aesthetics is as senseless as sort of ridiculous. The explanation offered by the director is not at all sufficient to justify the amount and looks of violence here. Violence, which only exists to portray itself, that does not necessarily make a good movie - although this was the impression I got from parts of the reviews here.The semi-open end, where no word is spoken and it's all looks and small gestures of the members of the family could not make me forget that this movie has great weaknesses and lots of unused potential. I'm sorry, but Cronenberg has not convinced me with this piece of his work.",A History of Violence
1078,joss_fangrl,I just don't get it...it wasn't that good...,2,21 October 2005,"I would have given this movie a 1, but I decided I'd give it a two based on the two things I thought were actually good about this movie...the sex and the violence. I was completely bored with the movie except for the sex and the violence. The dialog was horrible. I know these people are good actors, I've seen them in other movies...but the conversations they had were so dull. And the portrayal of Edie when she was upset just looked like over acting or a direction to overreact. I honestly felt like someone wrote the sex and violent scenes and filmed them and then noticed they didn't have anymore money, so they went to the local high school to write up the characters and the script. Maybe I'm missing it, but I just didn't think it was as good as everyone keeps saying.",A History of Violence

Many of the IMDb reviewers have fundamentally misunderstood this film and read it literally rather than as a medium for exploring themes and ideas. Why are Americans so obsessed with a literal interpretation, with narrative structure, character development and 'closure' and unable to understand reflection, symbolism and reference? With superb performances, stunning cinematography, superb deconstruction of American cinematic, social and historic archetypes, this films works not as a realist exercise but as a study and critique of American values and genres. Along with Lynch, Cronenberg is one of the great North American utters.",A History of Violence
1080,kaelaura,Awful,1,31 March 2006,"You have got to be kidding me. Whoever reviewed this as ""the best movie of the year"" had better be joking. I know what you are thinking, ""Ed Harris, Vigo Mortenson coming off Lord of the Rings, they're not gonna settle for crap."" Well, my friend they did. This is on the list of worst movies of all time. The story sucks and the acting is worse. I was so excited to see this movie and was tremendously disappointed by it. The direction of the movie was also simply horrendous. The plot line jumps all over the place trying to tell a story that is too long for the running time of the movie. Seemingly important characters spend, at times, less than five minutes on screen. Save your time and money and skip this one.",A History of Violence
1081,pareto-1,Cronenberg Swings and Misses,5,21 October 2005,"Too many times I have been disappointed by the work of Cronenberg critics and followers scream ""gotta see"". This one, regrettably isn't any different. Over-rated, perhaps because Cronenberg uses, yet again film medium mostly to explore just how far he can take violence and sex on the screen. Unfortunately, this is as good as it gets. The message in ""History"" if there is one to be found at all, is that violence is a difficult profession to exit with a clean break. Apart from the many variations on this theme, including De Palma's Carlito's Way as just an example, there is little to glean from the movie that everyone didn't already know, if they knew nothing else. The effort to show how violence can meander its way through a family only adds insult to an already weak and over-cooked story line. Moreover, there were places in Cronenberg's characterization within the family in that how the family responded to the violence was not clear or obvious, and could even be argued unrealistic. However, this is a minor criticism in the context of a much larger shortcoming with the film. I suppose if there is anything noteworthy to say about the flick, it is that the cast and cameo appearance pull this flick out of its downward spiral, with some good 1-liners to boot. Half the theater I saw this in left before the credits arrived, many disgruntled, some saying they could have been doing something else, like providing Cronenberg with a better script. I would have been happy if I could have just got my money back. So, if you're a Cronenberg fan and dig hot sex scenes and violence that is in your face, well you'll love it. If you are waiting, and hoping for Cronenberg to develop something that goes beyond singular self evident observations, take a number.",A History of Violence
1082,DR-A,An allegory of violence,9,21 October 2005,"David Cronenberg creates a powerful cinematic statement on violence in America. To me, it is the best of this genre since ""Natural Born Killers,"" and even more disturbing. Not only does Cronenberg examine the violence of today's culture but he cleverly lures the audience into accepting violence, stretches our tolerance of it, even gets us to hope for it, to take pleasure in violence. And once he has us there, Cronenberg shows us just where we have arrived... in crimson.The film is an allegory. Everything Cronenberg presents is baldly over-depicted. His villains are too evil; his heroes as straightforward and sympathetic as a sheriff in an old TV western; his picture of family life is too wholesome, his married sex too raw and contrived. All for allegorical impact. We understand that the Stall family is too good to be true, live in a town too simple and neighborly to be real, akin to the way the 50's are sometimes portrayed. We also see unfathomable Evil. Watch it prey upon Innocence - as our eyes squint and our stomachs turn. By such consistent overstatement, ""A History of Violence"" breaks free of particular characters in a particular story, and assumes an allegorical orbit around the concept of violence itself - violence in its destructive transformative essence. We watch it waft through town, change the flow of passion in a marriage, infiltrate family dynamics, uproot a past, seep into the future.Cronenberg captures the all-encompassing, irreparable damage of violence, the relentless pandemic of violence. Violence infecting all it touches; not just in blood, bruises and bullets, but violence choking out spirit - stomping away trust - violence lurking in downcast eyes bereft of hope - violence crusting up in dried tears - violence poisoning the atmosphere with fear and silence - violence reproducing and taking root in the next generation - violence thriving where once lived virtue and humanity.A film to see and discuss.Ray",A History of Violence
1083,nicoheiberg,A tale of modern conflicts of morality,9,22 October 2005,"Cronenbergs ""History of Violence"" should not be regarded as a ""Kick-Flick"". Rather, it is a chronicle of morality in modern-day US (dare I say western society?). Heroes are villains and villains are heroes! This flick raises important socio-political and moral questions about the nature of humanity, and every persons ability to control his/her life. Personally, I would not get too caught up in the plots superficial dealings, as they are a ""high-level"" tease. If, however, the conclusion of the movie entices the philosophical part of your brain, you have come a long way in understanding Cronenburgs intention with this movie.

There's the film flub (""Tom"" is shot in the hand but the next day has no bandage or visible injury), as well as the gratuitous sex scene and nude shot with Maria Bello. Also, watch for the scene when he is driving from his rural Indiana home to Philadelphia. While still in Indiana we see a highway sign advising that Phily is 680 miles away! How about getting through Ohio before we start seeing mileage signs for Phialdelphia? William Hurt was great as his brother, so some of the final 30 minutes were salvaged.

1085,ballachick247,Violence Breeds Violence,4,23 October 2005,"I thought the movie was excellent....for about an hour. It had the audience on edge throughout the movie, but towards the end, it seemed to taper off, leaving unresolved questions. Many times during the movie, everyone around me, including myself, were like ""What?"" Some parts in the movie didn't seem to belong there, especially the part with Tom and his wife on the stair well. The movie had a couple good actors in it; Ed Harris and Ashton Holmes. Other than that, the rest of the cast seemed to be underacting and couldn't quite get into the character.Edie, played by Maria Bello, wavers from remarkably soul-bearing to embarrassingly mannered, sometimes in the same scene. When asked to cry, she does so with the level of vigor of a whiny two-year-old. Jack was played by Ashton Holmes, an actor that shows promise. He played his part to a high potential, especially in the moments where he is face-to-face dealing with the taunting of a smarmy school bully. As for the youngest member of the Stall family, newcomer Heidi Hayes is a dead-ringer for Laura Dern without a semblance of acting ability. Her every moment on screen is nothing like the way a real child would act. The only part portrayed in the movie to its highest potential would be that of the Philly mobster Carl Fogarty, played by Ed Harris. He made the menacing mobster part more believable and intense, in comparison to Mortensen.Overall, I enjoyed the movie. If the movie had made more sense in what it was actually about, then I probably would have liked it more. I would recommend the film to anyone, but forewarn them of the gruesome graphic scenes in it and how the ending tapers off into oblivion. I would tell them that, yes, it's a good movie, but for only about an hour.",A History of Violence

It has none of the creative strangeness of his earlier films. Although the acting is decent, the lines are clunky, and there are big plausibility issues--and little ones, like a TV reporter who is completely foiled by ""I don't want to talk about it"" and a sheriff who says things like ""We're good people around here."" But maybe most importantly, the movie just proceeds dutifully from one scene to the next, where people say and do things that are completely obvious, that reveal no emotional depth, and that really have no purpose. Anyone who has seen the TV ads knows that Tom was probably once a ruthless killer and, yep, sure enough, he was. The revelation could hardly be less shocking, and the plot and characters develop in no interesting directions after that.",A History of Violence

So, let's see, in the space of a week a man shoots five men (ok, the son killed one of them) with a variety of firearms. Again, no investigation. Everyone carries on as normal.

What stinks is that the idea is such a great one, but the plot, writing, and acting are so flimsy and weak that you can see ever twist coming a half hour before it happens. The writing was dreadful. It was so stilted and expository. But the real big flaw is the acting. I thought Maria Bello was, as usual, very good. And there were many moments I liked Viggo Mortensen. But over all, it seemed like a graduate student film. All of the kids in the movie were atrocious. They were all ""acting"", you know? Pretending to feel the emotions that the script said they were supposed to feel, rather than really feeling them and being in the moment.And William Hurt and Ed Harris should be ashamed of themselves. They were cartoons. Laughable.I'm shocked that Cronenberg is still allowed to make films. I'm even more shocked that people actually reviewed this movie positively.",A History of Violence
1089,dud-sounds,complete and utter unmitigated rubbish,1,29 October 2005,"i didn't realise this was a Cronenberg movie until after it had finished. in fact, i didn't know much about the movie at all, but after some good recommendations from friends i was quite looking forward to it. rest assured, from now on, i will never listen to another word those friends say regarding movies! the only way i can describe this picture without swearing is a mess... in fact, it was so bad it encouraged me to sign up to IMDb so i could express just how painful an experience watching 'a history of violence' was!the film started (by this i mean the opening scene) promisingly i thought, with a nice long drawn-out opening shot and some distant, spacey acting. it also hinted somewhat of the nastiness to come. the quality of the film then immediately reared its head in the following 'child wakes up from nightmare' scene...(possible SPOILER, but of the most minimal kind)Aragorn/Viggo Mortensen - 'did you have a bad dream Sarah?' pointless daughter character - 'yes i did daddy' (son wakes up, enters pointless daughter's room) bland son - 'what's going on?' Aragorn -'Sarah had a bad dream son' bland son - 'oh no dad'(mother/bird from ER/that terrible movie where they dance on the bar enters pointless daughter's room) bird from ER - 'what's the matter honey? did you have a bad dream?' pointless daughter character (visibly getting bored now by the sheer length of the scene) - 'yes mommy, i'm going to sleep with the light on' all - 'what a great idea!'now, does a scene like this really need to last what feels like over three minutes?! i understand that Cronenberg's attempting to set up a semblance of the family's quiet life and how much love they have each other, but surely there are more subtle ways than this? now, i also realise that some may say Cronenberg often favours the more direct approach and tries to test his audience with occasional bouts of realism straight out of a comic book, but i'm sorry, just because he has built up a reputation of doing things this way (which on many occasions i've hugely enjoyed), does not mean he get away with sheer sloppiness of this magnitude. i thought 'Spider' was a great example of Cronenberg occasionally approaching his subject matter from a more 'considered' perspective, but precious little of that subtlety is on display in 'a history of violence'.the acting, i also thought, was below par. Mortensen was okay, though it seemed like he was repeating every other sentence that came out of his mouth. perhaps this is trying to portray Tom talking for his own benefit as well as others, convincing himself of that things he's saying are right & for the best, but even if that is the case it just came off as downright annoying. Maria Bello should stay on TV, Ed Harris was... well, Ed Harris, and William Hurt - what's the big deal? he was on screen for all of five minutes and at no point during that period of time did i see him do or say anything of worth or, as some have suggested, amusement. he should have stayed on the set of 'lost in space'.now, the violence and sexual content. put simply, i really didn't care. not at one moment in the movie did i feel any emotional contact with any of the characters' violent actions (and their reasons for committing them) save for - SPOILER - the son knocking the crap out of his tormentor at school, and that was simply because throughout i found the bully character so utterly pathetic and laughable that for all i cared he might as well have been put in hospital. END SPOILER - none of the violence really offended me. sure i was shocked in a few places, but that was simply because within a matter of seconds - SPOILER - one of the 'bad guys' had the front of his face hanging off. END SPOILER - so in this respect, Cronenberg doesn't hold back with, or indeed glamorise the violence, and certainly shows the immediacy and horror of it all, but to be honest, so what? it's hardly a difficult task to accomplish, especially for someone of Cronenberg's abilities. some of the sexual content also struck me as crass. SPOILER - now, don't get me wrong, i'm always down for Maria Bello with a completely untied dressing gown (in fact i waited what felt like years for that to happen in ER), but, in the context of the film, for the love of god WHY? so her and Aragorn get busy on the stairs in an odd 'what's going to happen' moment, then he's sitting in the bedroom, she comes out naked, closes her dressing gown and runs away in disgust. so now they can't have sex anymore. END SPOILER - does Cronenberg regard his audience as complete morons? or was there really no other way to indicate Maria Bello's feelings towards Mortensen's character? on this evidence, David Cronenberg is turning into Paul Verhoeven sans the wit.i don't often say this about movies, but going to see 'a history of violence' felt like a waste of money. usually there's something in a film i can invest in, be it a character, the cinematography or even the score, something that actually going to the movies really accentuates, but this picture had none of the aforementioned redeeming features. that said, i probably wouldn't let other people's opinions form a basis on whether i shouldn't bother seeing a movie. all i'm saying is, if you have to satisfy your curiosity, wait for the DVD.",A History of Violence

I think the film opens very well. The plot starts off a bit slow, some sexual scenes between Tom and Edie were quite pointless and some dialouge was very over done. All I kept saying to myself was, I get the point.Tom Stall is working one night, two men, who were introduced from the start, come to rob the store but Tom Stall flips, killing them and being shocked by it.OK, so far it's not that bad.Then Ed Harris shows up being awesome. His eye all messed up by this guy Joey who is believed to be really Tom. Ed Harris' character begins to stalk his wife and daughter at the mall.OK, so far so good.But here's when it sucks.Ed Harris is killed by Jack, Tom Stall's (Joey's) son. Good writing I think. The whole sins of the father now become sins of the son, yes it works. Then the wife becomes afraid of him, the family, everybody. OK.Then the movie decides to get pointless. He gets a call from his brother played by William Hurt. We all know now that he really is Joey and has been on the run for many years, hiding out in Indiana. So he goes all the way to Philly so we can see William Hurt deliver such a bad performance it made me wanna cry and some of the worst choreographed action scenes (if you want to call it that) ever.This film had the potential of being so much more.

It nicely (although uncomfortably) explores the insidious way violence, once introduced into an environment, infects its surroundings and leaves its mark. The questions regarding the genesis of violence and whether it can ever be genuinely left behind are intriguingly left unanswered. The film was very well acted and for the most part, well directed. However, I get the feeling Mr. Cronenberg doesn't know many women or little girls.The early love scene establishes not only that Tom and Edie are deeply in love and have great tenderness and respect for one another, but that Edie is no repressed, backwoods prude. So a passionate sex scene would not be out of character. What is out of character is Edie's amorous response to Tom's actions on the stairs. Nothing to that point has demonstrated that she is anything other than a well-adjusted woman with high self esteem. That woman would be appalled by the ""attack"" and would not find it stimulating. It would have made sense if Tom, in his anger and fear of losing everything he loved, had grabbed her neck and her ankle, perhaps even started to force himself on her (thinking he could remind her that he was still the man she loved). He would have caught himself short and would have himself been appalled. Additionally, the nudity that follows (the untied robe) is gratuitous. Edie is angry, hurt and frightened. She has said she doesn't know who Tom truly is, she doesn't trust him and doesn't know what he is capable of. No woman would willingly expose herself to a man she feels that way about. If Mr. Cronenberg needed the nudity, he should have caught it for a moment with Edie immediately closing the robe.Lastly, irrespective of what Edie may have said to Sarah, when daddies are gone for a whole day and night or even a few hours, little girls Sarah's age run to the door yelling, ""Daddy, Daddy"". It was not established that Sarah was afraid of or angry at her father so her behavior while touching is unrealistic. All in all a good story; sympathetic characters, sweet relationships, asking some meaningful questions and making an important point.",A History of Violence

Of course the worst about this movie is that i actually went to watch it because of its rating in this site!!7,6????Give me a breakkk!!You can do better than that!! At least it was funny.The movie starts with some really boooring scenes in the small town and what ,me and my friends, least expecting were 15 minutes of sexx.And i mean SSEEEXXXX!!!Well it was quite a documentary about human 'relationships' ;).Sorry about my English..",A History of Violence

To me this movie wanted to be a combination of Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, but it stayed as a ""wanna be""!It's one of those movies that it ends and you say ""who cares?!"" None of the characters are interesting, everything is quite predictable and the movie us sslloooowwww! At the end the mobster guys are more like a bad version of ""Men in Black"" you are NEVER afraid of them and you know that the ""hero"" will beat them all.In short, I really don't understand why the critics and so many people like this movie!!!

I have been a fan of Cronenberg's for a long time and fully expected a brilliant, if disturbing, film. Wow!! The direction, acting and writing were all top notch! Cronenberg has taken a deceptively simple story and created something much, much more. Anyone who thinks otherwise in probably waiting for the next Harry Potter sequel! This the type of movie Hollywood should be making, instead of mindless superhero sequels and video game adaptations. Keep up the great work David!!

Unfortunately, I found that there was a lot left unexplained, a lot over explained, and I could not really care about most of the characters. The son's situation seemed completely gratuitous, and for me to even care about what was going on in his life there should have been more fleshing out of the ""father/son"" dynamic. Speaking of gratuitous, while I am not one to turn down seeing Viggo Mortensen in various modes of undress, I thought that the sex scenes could have been more tasteful, and the audience would still get a firm understanding of the husband and wife's feelings for each other. I found the writing childish, and the acting stilted. Lastly, the story could have centered on Ed Harris's character's quest, with the movie ending on the Stalls front lawn. That, I believe, would have made a better story.",A History of Violence

Very good acting - Viggo's facial expressions were many and varied and really contributed to a deeper understanding of his character, Tom. Maria Bello was stellar. Ashton (the son) was quite good too. The story line seemed a bit weak and had I known the story line before I stumbled into the theater I would not have chosen to see it. But, DCs directing was as expected and I was somewhat surprised by how much I enjoyed this film. (well, I am enjoying and appreciating it more now that it's over - it's the kind that lingers on the brain long after) And then there are the (INCREDIBLE) sex scenes. yes, worth it just for the sex scenes, really.

However, there was something missing in this movie. Probably the fact that it started soooooooooo slow, had real problems with pace and lack of action at times (people looking at each other with sorrow in their eyes and not SAYING anything...nothing to carry the story forward).I don't like the choice made with Joey/Tom's past (why couldn't it have been a guy just trying to hide from his past (that would be very human and we could empathize) or some schizo thing a la Fight Club...either would've been more interesting than a ""quasi-multiple personality"" thing.But basically, the movie moves too slow...has way too much Act I, not much Act II, and a real ambiguous Act III which for me overshadow the fine acting.",A History of Violence

I ended up laughing out loud with my buddy in the cinema after the umpteenth ridiculous and unbelievable scene (I think it was the one where our main character jumped his angry wife on the stairs). Minutes later she stands in the the doorway butt naked. Just what was the reason for this scene? Another problem with the film that in essence it is finished half way ( or three quarters of the way).

I'm not a supporter of censorship, but at the same time, I dislike gratuity. Sure, it's titillating, but it demeans the viewers. It's sensationalism.Next, the movie stops being serious fairly quickly, and once Viggo gets to Phillidelphia, the whole thing is pretty comical.

The chemistry between the son and the bully was pure comedic magic. As if they were staring into the camera and saying ""Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn. You are on notice"" As I was leaving, I heard the most apt description to describe it - ""It was like a mediocre 'Lifetime Channel' movie"" Ouch.

1105,h-mercier,Message or no message?,2,29 December 2005,"For those who are conjecturing about a conceivable message in Mr. Cronenberg's movie (although he reportedly said there was none), or wonder whether they might possibly have missed it, here's the gist of it:In case your ambition as a retired mobster is to peacefully enjoy a modest but honest average American's family life, it's not enough to tear off one or two hit men's eyes with a strand of barb wire (it's dangerously unprofessional): you've got to terminate the job, i.e. to properly knock them off (including your own hapless brother if need be) before you're entitled to your son's respect and your sweet blond little daughter's redemptive love.Now don't bother to be truthful toward your spouse: in the best case she wouldn't be of any help; at worst, she might just muck the whole business up. So the less she knows, the better for her own good. By the way, true men don't chatter: they just do what's to be done, period. (However, raping her in the staircase, just in order to ensure her loyalty, might be a good idea.)Although I'm no pundit on American cinema in general, what I can say is that, compared with D. Cronenberg's synopsis, C. Eastwood's 'M$ Baby' philosophy, for instance, is one of utmost nuance and subtlety.Otherwise, a reasonably thrilling entertainment which you can reasonably omit to see, specially if your expectations are high in this field.",A History of Violence
1106,northern-cali-doc,Let's be honest: this movie is winning points for cool violence and sex,4,2 January 2006,"I've read many a movie review on this website, but after watching this movie, I decided to register and post a review.I'm no idiot: My interpretations of Mulholland Drive and Donnie Darko were pretty close to the Salon.com explanations.Having said that, this movie is no metaphor nor an exploration of any deep philosophical issues. Those who think so are likely marvelling at the naked emperor's clothes.To be fair, some might consider the gratuitous sex and violence artistic, in the way of Clockwork Orange. Or they might point out that the son's sudden and proficient outburst of violence suggests that a propensity for violence is genetic. May be. whoopty do.This movie is enjoyable and gets good ratings because it has the things that an American audience likes: a good guy that is humble but can kick ass, mean-looking evil guys that get their asses kicked, and a beautiful woman that has graphic sex with the main character.""Payback"" with Mel Gibson. ""Get Carter"" with Sylvester Stallone. I consider these movies similar to ""A History of Violence,"" because they appeal to the same appetites.I take issue with the graphic sex, but that's my personal opinion. I enjoyed the ass-kicking violence. I enjoyed the initial plot, which was very interesting. Mortenson plays the protagonist well; Ed Harris does a decent job as well. I don't know what to make of Maria Bello, asides from being eye candy for the male audience.But please: don't pretend this movie is deep, or even well done. The first two action scenes were exciting, sure. The action scene at the end is not only unrealistic, it's comical. The theater audience was laughing, myself included. Most of the characters were superficial cut-outs from a million other movies: the people who work at the diner; the kids sharing a milkshake in the diner; the small town sheriff; the high school bully; the mafia goons. The ending is abrupt and unredeeming.Conclusion: If you're looking for some good action like ""Payback"" and ""Get Carter"", than watch this movie.

For me the violence in this film is absolutely necessary for the way of the linear narrative, and the difference stories of the film. Violence in the film is genetic, and all of the members of the family accept that at last.

1110,oddtraveler,A History of Violence portraying neither very well!,1,16 January 2006,"I just came back from seeing this film with some friends and we all left the theater dumbfounded that a movie could be as critically acclaimed as this and be this bad! I've walked out of better movies than this; were it not for the fact that I was with a large group I would have. Where to start? I guess where most of the complaints start: 1. The sex scenes were awful. The first one: ""how can we make the audience believe that they're a loving intimate married couple? I know, let's throw in a sex scene with a cheerleader outfit and 69!"" Yeah right after more than 15 years of marriage she only now comes up with this? I get kinky and spicy sex, and among married people (all of us that saw it are married too), but both of the sex scenes were shot like porn - the mechanics of having sex dominated the screen time and overtook the focus on the interaction between the characters at that moment. There's been a lot of sex scenes that I can get behind that were kinky, but the director didn't turn it into a porn film (Something's Gotta Give scene where Jack cuts off the shirt with a pair of scissors comes to mind. Not my favorite, but certainly not porny). And what was with the ""my bathrobe's hanging open and I'm mad at you"" scene? Who puts on a bathrobe just to wander around showing full frontal?2. The violence. I know, I know, it's right in the title, but my complaint isn't about the existence of it in the film, it's the campy way it was shot. Tom/Joey killed someone, quick, cut to the gored up face or the crushed neck so people know it was violent! Not even any of the characters reaction to seeing it, just show the audience to gross them out. Not one scene was suspenseful, tense, or even well choreographed (what's with the gangster brother being totally unable to shoot a man ten feet away?)2. Where's any of the actual history in this History of Violence? Just a bunch of characters saying ""you know what you were like"", and a very flat reading by Viggo of ""I spent three years trying to bury Joey"" to his wife. 3. The acting by Viggo was entirely wooden and practically monotone. The girl who played the daughter was just creepy. 4. What married couple acts like this, ever? I've been in some fierce fights in my own marriage where I wondered who the hell this person really was, and the whole time I just sat there scratching my head at how they thought they had conveyed this difficult situation well. 5. Why was this whole movie gray? Visually it was about as boring as you could get, and the camera work just didn't seem very interesting or well thought out. 6. Last but not least, if you have that complex of a story to tell, then give it a bit more than an hour and a half. There were a lot of things that just weren't established well enough to keep the audience going. We all basically agreed that we wanted to like this movie really badly, but were pretty much completely uninterested after the first half. The fights between the family members were footnotes at best, and we see nothing of whether this guy is really a changed man or feeding his wife a line. The interactions with these characters is so scripted and minimally engaging that I never felt I got a good sense of what these characters' mindsets really were. WIthout that what's the bloody point? I really wonder about the people who watched this that would consider this a more mature film with complex and challenging themes.

Anyway, the characters are great, and mostly realistic. This isn't a movie for everyone, but then again, what movie is? I personally thought the development of the story was handled very well, while at the same time keeping the audience entertained with vices such as graphic violence and very very intense intimacy. The twist in the middle of the film (well, its kind of a twist I guess) is a great shocker and helps to drive the suspense even farther. I just wish it had been a little more revealing in the ending, but I guess the point may be to leave the audience with the ability to decide how things would end up if they were in that situation.

It seems to try to be saying something deep about violence, but it simply comes across as a bad action movie. Sure, we have the wife doing some apparently contradictory things and the last scene is unresolved, but that hardly constitutes depth. The sex, too, tries to be saying something deep, but instead meanders on and on, much as it did in Cronenberg's ""Crash"", obviously trying to make us feel uncomfortable but with no clear reason.William Hurt clearly went to the Tony Soprano school for his scenes - embarrassing from such a good actor.

The cinematography was excellent and the score very effect. You feel a cornucopia of emotions throughout the film and there is a feeling of dread that permeates the entire movie. Most of the acting was above average. The main actors do an excellent job and the supporting stars were effective. Cronenberg's touch is all over this movie. For all the people who thought that there was no suspense in the violence and also complained about the sex being too graphic... PLEASE!!! This movie is VERY violent but graphic??

1121,goldoug,I laughed all the way through... too bad this film's not meant to be funny.,1,13 March 2006,"I was really excited for this movie. It looked like it would be interesting with good actors and an original and intriguing concept. The trailer offered just enough information to peak my interest and left me wanting more. Unfortunately, the trailer was better than the actual movie.*SPOILERS* (although, spoiling this movie isn't exactly a crime) I'm going to start with the illogical reactions of the characters to what's happening to them. First off, when has anyone ever started a fight over catching a ball in PE class? I played many games of baseball/softball/kickball over my time in grade school and high school and there were plenty of botched plays by good players and good plays by less talented athletes. I never, EVER, saw any of the more athletic kids even get remotely upset when the less coordinated kid caught the fly ball of one of the better athletes. That scene early on set the tone for strange writing and dialogue for the rest of the film. I'm not going to claim that I completely understand women, but I think I know enough to question the sex scene on the stairs after his wife finds out she's been lied to their ENTIRE LIFE TOGETHER. They were married for quite a long time before this movie takes place. She only knew him as the father of their kids and a diner owner. Then all of a sudden it's apparent that he was once a hit-man for the mob. So what's her reaction? Of course... SEX ON THE STAIRS... which is then immediately followed by her being mad at him again. I'm not at all saying that she wouldn't forgive him for his past or realize why he was hiding it... but I don't know of anyone who would react like that and it was even a stretch for a movie. There are several other scenes which defy logic and any normal reason, however, I really don't want to go into all of them because simply, I don't have the motivation.The action was pretty realistic for a Hollywood film, although you'd be hard-pressed to find a shotgun that penetrated through a man and left exit wounds on the back side. The concept was good and that's what led me to watch this movie in the first place. There are all sorts of good actors in this movie, but all the great actors in the world couldn't have saved the horribly irrational and unbelievable dialogue. I really wanted to like this movie... I really really did. But I found myself laughing at the lack of believability of the characters, dialogue, and choices they made (this is not a comedy).The relatively high marks this movie has gotten further solidifies my feeling that as long as there is lots of nudity and/or violence (this movie has plenty of both) many people will enjoy the film. Forget about characters, plot, and quality film making... all film makers need to be successful is nudity with a little violence thrown in. Violence and nudity have their places in movies, but they should be used to support the plot, further character development, and build tension or climax. They should not, however, be the ONLY up side of a movie.If you liked it, great. I, however, thought it was one of the worst movies I've seen in a very long time. I was thoroughly frustrated.",A History of Violence
1122,jgelat1,Movie of the Year,9,10 April 2006,"The film on a whole is just a little short of perfect. The story has the right amount of suspense, mystery, and action to entertain even the casual film-goer. The direction and acting are where the movie shines.

(NO surprise to anyone who saw The Cooler) Mortensen s' acting was awesome as well. It is his responsibility in this role to lead the viewer to the end without giving it away, he does so stupendously. During many moments the viewer will second guess themselves. The brilliance is also in the directing of Cronenberg. At the appropriate moments he takes license with the story to reinforce certain personalities and motives. This is the tie that binds this movie so well. A History of Violence is the one to watch this year.",A History of Violence
1123,salinecreekdreamer,Leave it on the shelf.,2,16 March 2006,"We rented this flick before realizing it was another David Cronenberg film. True to his latest efforts, such as 'Crash', this film starts out hard to follow, taking an extraordinary amount of time to connect some of the characters and develop a plot line.While the warning of sexual content is listed on the cover, they fail to warn that the sex scenes have absolutely nothing to do with the plot and are poorly done. Gratuitous, at best.The family is sometimes portrayed as loving and normal, other times cold and dysfunctional. Neither portrayal is believable. The interaction is too stoney and scripted.Too many holes in the storyline. Impossible timelines. Questions left unanswered. (Who cleaned up the mess? Magic truck? Where have you been?) And an entire investigation left out.On the plus side, some of the action scenes are well done, if not overdone in some aspects. Ed Harris and William Hurt are excellent in their roles. It's a shame they were not involved in more scenes.Again, leave this one on the shelf. I want my money back.",A History of Violence
1124,ppinette,Overrated.,3,16 March 2006,"I missed this film in the theatres and was anxiously anticipating the DVD release. I rented it the first day of the release, and was highly disappointed. The characters lacked motivation, the dialogue was horrible at times, the 'plot twists' were beyond predictable. Hmmm, is he really Joey, or isn't he? Oh he is...now what? I know the daughter was only like 5, but come on, my dog could have delivered those lines more convincingly. Then the teenage bully... bad acting, bad writing. In fact, the only good acting performances were given by Maria Bello and Ed Harris. The son had his moments. Viggo Mortenson's character never showed a shred of believable emotion. If Cronenberg did that on purpose, it was a bad choice, as it left the character hollow. The fight scenes were totally unbelievable. Like when Richie is shooting at him from 7 feet away but can't seem to land a shot. Then after he kills Richie and his men, then wanders down to the pond why is it daylight all of a sudden? If he's been waiting around til morning, then why is he still holding the gun? At the end he gets home and his family is understandably glum. But isn't the daughter too young to understand what's going on? A real child would have jumped up and run to her daddy. Not this one, she hesitates, then gets him a plate. How sweet and thoughtful...but not human! Then the film ends, no closure, no dialogue. Thanks Cronenberg, I'll remember you for eXistenZ, not this garbage.",A History of Violence
1125,brokenarizona,"Good Movie, Disappointing Ending",7,26 March 2006,"This movie was very entertaining and quite suspenseful. I would recommend seeing it. My only complaint would be how the movie ends. What the ?!?!?! Viggo does an excellent portrayal of his character as does the rest of the cast. This movie had me guessing and second-guessing myself all the way to the confusing ending. All in all this movie accomplishes what it sets out to do. It's main and supporting characters employ a well thought out juxtaposition that gets its direction from the movie title. It is also quite graphic in the more violent scenes, as well as the sexual ones. Don't take the kiddies to see this one.",A History of Violence
1126,sammie_hager,Not Impressed,4,17 March 2006,"This movie was a real let down. Vigo has done better movies. This movie really lacks a story line. Between crying, fighting, and gun shots this movie really had nothing to offer. I was excited when the movie came out on DVD because I had not had the chance to see it in theaters. Since I am overseas I tend to buy movies since they don't all make it over to our theaters on base. After watching this movie I wish I had rented it for $2.75 rather then bought it for $19.95. All I could think about after the movie was over was that I had just wasted $20 dollars on a movie that really made no sense do to it's jumping around no story line nature. Like I stated before, Vigo has done better movies. This film does him no justice.",A History of Violence
1127,LongLive_TheCode,An Experience...,7,23 August 2006,"This is the kind of movie you should watch alone, and it's best if you know nothing of the the movie beforehand. It really is an experience in the sense- Cronenburg does an excellent job of making you feel what the characters feel and juggle your emotions.As I said, I personally believe this movie is best if you know know nothing of the plot at all, so I am refraining from writing a summary. If you really want to know just to understand what to expect, the IMDb outline captures it very well without giving anything specific away. The genre can be defined as a Crime related Drama with brief action sequences- if you like the Sopranos, you will probably enjoy this.Most of the acting is excellent, and it really helps you feel the other characters emotions and helps you become less of a silent omniscient observer, and more like a bystander to all of the events. Fear, concern, shock- all of it will take over you and make you get into the movie more.On the other hand, there are some drawbacks. A lot of the details are a bit gratuitous, and really unnecessary to the plot- they didn't entertain, they didn't shock, they didn't provide realism even, they were just distracting. Some of the dialogue was very clichéd as well, and I felt like the reasons behind some of the character's actions in the beginning were really undefined. The movie also isn't the kind of movie you can watch over and over again- once you know what happens, the excitement of your feelings being juggled isn't nearly as prominent.Overall, I highly recommend this. Probably only as a rental, and not if you're watching it with a lot of people.",A History of Violence
1128,ECCEpr,Wow,8,19 March 2006,"One of the best movies of 2005...and there were very few from which to choose. Viggo Mortensen and Maria Bello are underrated and should have been nominated. Intense and subtle at the same time - in terms of performance, plot and timing. Wow. Highly recommend this movie. Somewhat predictable but still very tight and exciting. I'm trying to get my breath back...I just saw it five minutes ago. Again, it should have been nominated for more awards. The final scene was very well done and moving. Thought the pace was slow at first but it was just right after all. My boyfriend made me watch it...and he was right. Good call on his part. How much more of this do I need to write? Get it NOW.",A History of Violence
1129,jdstower,A History of Garbage ...,4,21 March 2006,"I'm sorry but I had to post a review after seeing some of the rave reviews posted about this movie.I came into this movie with admittedly high expectations, and was sorely disappointed.After seeing the advertisements for this movie I was expecting the storyline to following something along the lines of Long Kiss Goodnight, but in the end the Long Kiss Goodnight is a far superior movie.The opening scene brings great promise, but the groans in the audience could be heard soon after this in the opening family sequence where the family tends to the daughter having nightmares. The acting in this scene was somewhat of a warning to come.The acting is mediocre. Ed Harris was probably the class of the film, while Ashton Hall - despite starting poorly in the above scene - performs well in the long run. Maria Bello gives her usual hollow performance, while William Hurt looked like he spent a whole half-hour preparing for this script. Hang on - check that - it must have been more because he must have spent a better part of the week growing that ridiculous goatee (or whatever it was).This movie traveled too slow - there was only really three scenes that involved any kind of action, and the storyline was not interesting enough to carry the rest of the film. I believe the Director knew this too, thus insert these intense, somewhat graphic love scenes, which (a) did not really add to the storyline, and (b) was completely out of context with the mood of the movie at that time - especially with the somewhat wooden Viggo Mortensen involved.And - while I am a member of the male community and therefore very much appreciate the naked female form - Maria Bello's open-gown shot came completely from left field.Overall, if this movie was two minutes longer I would have walked out. While some aspects of the film were enjoyable, overall it would be better viewed on DVD. And in regard to the other reviews on this site, I believe some people are guilty of reading far too much into this one. Take a deep breath, take a step back and have another look at it for what it really is ... a load of garbage.",A History of Violence
1130,myriad_mystery,Why the good reviews?,1,28 March 2006,"I just watched this movie, and I am incredibly confused as to how its rating on IMDb is so very high. I've read through many reviews, and a lot of people seem to comment on the ""deeper meanings"" of this movie, how it attempts to show us someone's philosophical ideas about violence in our society. I completely understand where they're going with this. It's a great hidden meaning, it sounds like it might make a good movie. But this? Please, not this. Not a single scene was believable. During the first sex scene, my state of mind was resolving more around ""wtf?"" than on considering how this scene showed some mystical bond between the two main characters. In both sex scenes, and in the violence scenes, I honestly felt like the movie was just trying to push, to be something it wasn't, to shock the viewers into thinking some deeper hidden meaning existed. But I can honestly say I didn't feel it. Shocked, yes. Did I come away from this movie feeling like I had learned anything? Not at all. Watching this movie felt like falling asleep, with occasional scenes of sex or violence thrown in to keep to viewer awake. Really, you're better off sleeping. The other main problem I had with this movie was the clichés. The worst of these has to be the bully at the high school. His character does nothing more than look angry, be a jackass, a coward, and try to beat up the little guy. Clichés are unrealistic. If you're trying to make a point in a movie, if you want someone to find a deeper meaning, make sure they believe in the movie enough to even think about it in the first place, please.",A History of Violence
1131,tucherlover,"horribly-horrible, if you are interested in horrible writing and sub-par acting, this is the movie for you!",1,25 March 2006,"Honestly, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in a while. The script is awful, the acting is horrible, and frankly it was a waste of my time. I had to do all I could do to stop my self from turning it off. The gun-shot scenes are well done.... that is the only positive this piece of junk is getting from me! I should have known better...... this tool Blockbuster-worker recommended the movie and his recommendations have been horrible in the past. For a point of reference, he said ""Kingdom of Heaven"" was horrible and he shut if off half way through. So basically, if you like Cinemax caliber movies, ""A Histroy of Violence"" is the movie for you!",A History of Violence
1132,mysticenforcer290,horrible... absolutely horrible.,1,25 March 2006,"This movie was horrid... I mean me and my father were both looking forward to this film. We thought it was going to be amazing. A film full of action and a great plot... but what we got was a slow movie with a generic plot.The plot was generic, I mean there are a ton of movies where someone is running from their past, someone from their past comes to find them, and then person is forced out of their new life. I wanted something new, I got something recycled.and then I thought I was going to get a nice, fast movie, with action and answers around each corner, what I got what a movie that moved at a snails pace. The starting scene was promising. I enjoyed it, I knew what was going to happen but the camera and the acting what generally good. After that the movie just got worse, once the coffee shop killing happened the movie got horrid.When the scenes that were supposed to show how the family interacted were on screen, it didn't seem real and it seemed that the actors didn't care and there was no chemistry. When ever there was violence it was too gory for the slow paced film that this movie was, and it just didn't fit, and the sex scenes were just randomly there. I mean one second the guy is at home lazy, the next he's killing someone, and then like 2 seconds later he's banging his wife, like wtf? I think the worst part was th ending. The ending was bad. First of all he goes to a mobsters house and there are 4 guards. They all get killed by the main character like like 30 seconds, and then of course the brother ends up going out side, the door closes and then someone gets shot, the brother thinks that it's his brother but it really was the last guard, surprise! He then drives home, sits down with his family at dinner and there is like a 10 minute scene where his family forgives him for lying to them for all their lives ""I know you are a mobster and I really know nothing about you, but I still love you."" since when would a teenager just forgive their parent if all they knew of them was a lie? Horrible, don't see it, I was disappointed, go see DOOM, Serenity, or well any other movie... this was bad, and well I'd rather watch Mortal Kombat (the movie) then it... skip this and see anything else, and i mean anything.",A History of Violence
1133,mariampaz,This is by far one of the worst movies I have ever seen.,1,25 March 2006,"I'm shocked that Ed Harris chose to do this movie... The casting was bad-I did not believe Ed Harris or William Hurt in this movie, and they are usually very good actors-either they were given very bad direction or they could just not play these roles. The story line had too many holes in it. How is it that one man kills 4 people and a podunk cop is the only one who investigates? Where is the prosecutor/FBI? It seems that the ""mob families"" involved are not very large or connected...how does one man take them all down and remain alive and unafraid after that. What did the son and the bully have to do with anything? It seems they were trying to make an attempt at the apple not falling far from the tree but it just was not fleshed out well. Why is the 4 year old girl still sitting in a car seat? That's petty but there are so many things from the beginning of the movie that are not believable that you lost me even there.",A History of Violence
1134,woltkamp,Worst Movie Ever.,1,27 March 2006,"This really may be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I don't even know where to begin the criticism. Bad acting, poor cinematography, no plot worth mentioning--and to top it off (or perhaps to try and add something exciting) random scenes of unnecessary nudity. (i.e. How on earth does Maria Bello appearing naked in the doorway of the bathroom add to the plot whatsoever!??!) And the gore--the whole movie was so laughable that the gore didn't even phase me. I cannot fathom what the value of this movie was--sometime you see a movie that isn't necessarily profound but is a fun diversion for a bit, but this one wasn't even entertaining. Don't waste your time, I am angry I will never get that hour and a half of my life back.",A History of Violence
1135,cybernetic_angel2,Over the Top (Good and Bad),6,28 March 2006,"My husband and I watched the movie in the theater and while he raved and raved about how good it was something sat a little ill with me, and I couldn't quite explain why. It wasn't until my husband bought the movie and brought it home to be watched a second time that I really understood what I found disturbing.I really liked the film. I liked Tom's family and his willingness to do anything to protect them. I loved the wife and her spirit that said ""I'm not taking this from anyone."" Throughout the movie she was always acting in defense of her family as well. The children were you typical American children; the boy bullied at school, the girl scared of the dark and protected by her big brother. The bad guys looked bad, the good guys looked good. There was a black and whiteness about it that wasn't blurred into gray. You knew who to cheer for. You knew who to hate.Warning, possible spoiler, do not read on if you haven't seen the movie and don't want it ruined.Okay, on to what made me think twice. To me, the movie was a bit of an over dramatization of a lot of things. It doesn't start out that way; the bad guys in the beginning were very believable. There were a few things that were so minor I wouldn't bother to mention them, but let's start with the mother.When the wife finds out that her husband really is ""Joey"" her reaction is as violent as though she were poisoned. She runs into the bathroom, throwing up. Then she storms out of the hospital room in an absolute huff. Never once do you see her really taking into consideration the fact that for 15+ years her husband has never shown signs of this ""Joey"" he has been a loving husband and father. And that seems to count for nothing all of a sudden.When the son gets in trouble for fighting at school Tom says to him, ""In this family, we don't solve our problems by hitting people."" The son responds, ""No, in this family we just shoot them."" After which Tom slaps him and he runs from the house. The scene was made for us to see an incline in ""Tom's"" violent behavior. We are supposed to see Joey coming back. Had I said that to my father he would have smacked me too. I think the cause and effect of that seen was way over done, and blown horribly out of proportion to the father/son relationship. Later, when the son finds out that Tom is Joey he approaches his father and says all sorts of demeaning things including, ""If I tell Sam who you are, are you going to have me whacked?"" A son who has grown up with a loving father (as depicted in the beginning of the movie) would be stunned but less than likely ready to assume that his father would do such things to him. He would be more likely to disbelieve and fight the truth than embrace it and label his father a ruthless killer just as the wife had done. My husband is a Marine. He has killed in combat, when he gets angry I ask him what is wrong and I try to comfort him, I don't get in his face and say, ""If I don't do the dishes are you going to gut me with a K-Bar?"" Nuff-said.Finally we have all this drama and all of this pain just to bring a man back to Philly and kill him. Three, heavily armed mobsters come all the way to Indiana from Philadelphia to collect ""Joey"" and take him back to Philadelphia to be killed? (Are you seeing where this is heading?) When Tom drove all the way to Philly and confronted his brother I thought perhaps they wanted him to come all the way there to pay back some money or maybe finish a job. Maybe they wanted him to go back into business with them. No, all they wanted to do was kill him. They are mob guys, they would walk into the diner shoot him in the head, go home and forget the ring around the rosy they so eloquently play with ""Tom"" and his family. They have better things to do, more important people to drop off of rooftops. These are professional mobsters who are not going to stalk a man for days just to drag him across the country to put a bullet in him (or in this case, strangle him). I was very disappointed that all of this happened just so they could kill him. It was a let down.On another good note, the acting was wonderful. The cast was first class and though they had little to work with, they did their best with what they had. The plot and script was poor, were it not for the cast the movie probably would not have even gone on to be a movie. Bravo to the cast. Everyone's performances were stellar.",A History of Violence
1136,sarah_cunningham329,The movie BEYOND cliché!,2,25 April 2006,"Personally, I found ""History of Violence"" to be perhaps one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. Everything was ridiculously, even sickeningly cliché: the characters, plot line, sex scenes, etc. Sure, you could attempt to uncover some deeper meanings in each individual line of each scene, as others have attempted to do; however, my personal opinion: the violent scenes were unrealistic, the sex scenes ludicrously unnecessary, the characters cookie-cutter, and the dialogue bland and uninteresting. I rented this movie thinking it showed promise; unfortunately, it failed to come through, and I was vastly disappointed. In short, the movie was poorly done. In a word, shallow.",A History of Violence
