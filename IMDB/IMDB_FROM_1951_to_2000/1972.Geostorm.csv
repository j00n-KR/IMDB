0,TheLittleSongbird,"Big in spectacle, not so big in much of everything else",4,31 October 2017,"Am hardly biased in any way against disaster films (there are some good entertaining ones out there), but judging from the dreadful advertising and negative critical reception expectations for 'Geostorm' were low. Still saw 'Geostorm', having liked some previous work of Gerard Butler, Andy Garcia and Ed Harris.Watching it giving it a fair chance, 'Geostorm' is not as dreadful as the misleading advertising made it look and it is nowhere near as bad as the worst of the SyFy/The Asylum disaster films. Then again, pretty much anything is better than films that are in a league of their own when it comes to incompetent quality, and putting 'Geostorm' on the same level of them would be insulting. 'Geostorm' has many problems, but at least it looked as if effort was put into it regardless of the generally muddled execution. Actually agree with most of the criticisms, other than finding that the visuals were better than has been given credit by the general consensus on Rotten Tomatoes.Starting with the good things, 'Geostorm' looks good. The special effects, although overused, are great and it was clear they were where most of the budget went. The Dubai tsunami is a standout. A couple of sequences are thrilling, again a standout is the Dubai standout and another is the Hong Kong explosions. The film is slick in photography and editing and the scenery is atmospherically and cleverly used.The music is haunting and rousing without being over-bearing. Didn't think much of the acting overall, but the best and most professional performance comes from Ed Harris, giving a performance that is in keeping with the film's tone while also trying to make a believable character out of what he has. Abbie Cornish also does her best.Gerard Butler however lacks his usual charisma and doesn't look comfortable. Jim Sturgess is also completely out of his comfort zone and looks embarrassed the whole time. Andy Garcia just looks like he couldn't be bothered. The dialogue is high in the cheese, cringe, cliché (not usually a bad thing but the film executes them badly) and stilted factors and can feel preachy, while Dean Devlin's direction is not a hack job but there is a real sense of inexperience and not being comfortable with the material.Furthermore the story just doesn't thrill and in monotonous in pacing and how most of it is staged. The spectacle is there, but even for a film where one actually goes in expecting to shut their brains off at the door there is a lack of brains and suspense, in turn replaced by tedium and excessive ridiculousness. Story-wise, 'Geostorm' is completely bonkers and on top of the generally less-than-thrilling, derivative and mindless action (with exceptions) there are attempts at character development that fall flat due to doing little to develop it properly (the brother relationship amounts to very little).As well as the heavy-handed and out-of-kilter political elements that just confuse the story tonally and an ending that feels completely at odds with the rest of the film. The preachiness of the ending also leaves a sour taste in the mouth.Overall, looks good but underwhelming on the whole. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Geostorm
1,Leofwine_draca,Better than you've heard,6,20 May 2018,"GEOSTORM is a serviceable Hollywood blockbuster with an imaginative storyline and little regard for realism. It appears to have received a great deal of criticism from fellow viewers but I've noticed that modern audiences seem to be out of love with the thriller genre these days and as such automatically hate anything that comes out. This film mixes the thriller and disaster genres pretty well, I thought; it has a decent international scale and some nice mystery aspects to the story that reminded me a little of OUTLAND and GRAVITY at times. The disaster sequences are derivative, but they're used as a means to an end rather than being solely focused upon, which is why this movie is much better than something like the cheesy 2012. Gerard Butler is fun as the weary action man, but this film really belongs to the tough women propelling the story along: Abbie Cornish and Alexandra Maria Lara are both very good. Ed Harris and Daniel Wu are also welcome presences in any movies in which they appear. Yes, GEOSTORM has problems and flaws, but it kept me watching throughout and certainly didn't disappoint me.",Geostorm
2,SnoopyStyle,frustratingly stupid without the campy fun,3,1 March 2018,"An international team led Jake Lawson (Gerard Butler) creates a global network of satellites to ameliorate the deteriorating weather. The system called Dutch Boy is controlled by a group of scientists from the massive International Space Station. Politicians push aside Jake and install his brother Max (Jim Sturgess) as the new leader with the UN set to take over from the US in 3 years. It's 3 years later and unexplained errors occur. Max recruits his estranged brother Jake to investigate any design problems on the space station.This is frustratingly stupid but not in a fun campy way. The only reason to have the space station is to have some big space action. Basically, the movie ends with control being reverted back to NASA on the ground which leaves me to question why a big expensive space station is needed. The only real world application is the repair garage for the satellites. It would make more sense for the satellites to be controlled from the ground. The CGI is fair for a second tier theatrical release. Everything is overwrought and big in a bad way. I'm willing to live with most of it until the movie gets the climax wrong. The emotional climax happens when Ed Harris is taken down. The problem with the rest of the movie is that it runs out of bad guys. It's a lot of uncompelling CGI action that gets very tiresome after awhile. It would help if Butler has to battle a bad guy on the station while trying to stop the global Geostorm but he had already knocked that guy off. This movie is throwing around a lot of CGI explosions without any tension or thrills.",Geostorm
3,Prismark10,Unspectacular,2,21 November 2017,"Dean Devlin together with director Roland Emmerich has had success in destroying buildings in films like Independence Day and Godzilla.In Geostorm which Devlin directs, the CGI is not as good the script is atrocious, the plot is diabolical and the acting ropey. Devlin's luck certainly run out here and the film gets progressively stupid.Following a series of weather related natural disasters, a system of satellites controls the climate. Called the 'Dutch Boy' it was designed by Jake Lawson (Gerard Butler.)Now some years later Dutch Boy is creating havoc. A icy patch in Afghanistan which freezes a village or a lava eruption in Hong Kong for example. The project is now managed by Max Lawson (Jim Sturgess) who replaced Jake after his outbursts upset the politicians.Max goes back to the International Space Station to fix Dutch Boy but both he and Max discover that Dutch Boy has been deliberately sabotaged to cause chaos, the culprit could be someone high at the Whitehouse.The film is a big budget dog's dinner.",Geostorm
4,nogodnomasters,I didn't know what eXtreme was,6,1 November 2017,"Plot Spoiler review? Extreme weather is killing the planet. Satellites around the globe are equipped to control the weather by shooting little pellets. It is controlled by a space station with the system designed by Jake Lawson (Gerald Butler). When the space station malfunctions, causing sharknados or something, only Gerald Butler pretending to be Mel Gibson can save the world...with the help from his brother (Jim Sturgess) who he must reconnect with to make a good personal story. It is quickly discovered it is sabotage and there is a mystery as to who would do this...unless you have ever seen a Scooby-doo episode, then you have it figured out. Are you smarter than a fifth grader? The science aspect of science fiction lacked explanation as to how they were able to control air pressure with pellets or the gravity maker which nearly every space film has, but in reality is not feasible any time soon...which is why NASA isn't working on one. The science fiction is more fiction than science. The mystery aspect wasn't really a mystery so we are left with a passable thriller with some light moments, mostly provided by Adepero Oduye.Guide: No swearing, sex or nudity.",Geostorm
5,kosmasp,"CGI good, movie not so good",5,7 February 2020,"And when I say good, I don't mean like excellent. But it's good, you should not be offended by it. I never watched this in the cinema, where I guess the movie might have impacted some people more than others. I don't even want to go near a comparisson with Jurassic Park (way better handled overall as a movie), but when it comes to story vs. technical achievements, there are similarities ... also when it comes to what you consider to help like a movie more or less.Butler is doing his thing and everyone else tries their best, but there is not much there. Some technical talk that may or may not make sense (I didn't really pay attention), with just a smudge of social commentary (climate change and all that) ... the main point is the movie tries to entertain and achieves that to a certain degree. Not quality time, but if you're into it ...",Geostorm
6,lee_eisenberg,Can some natural disaster deal with the people who make these movies?,1,16 February 2019,"Dean Devlin produced the likes of ""Independence Day"" and ""Godzilla"", so his directorial debut is a similar movie. ""Geostorm"" wants to see itself as an environmental movie, but it's the sort of flick that belongs on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"". Indeed, the YouTube series CinemaSins points out everything wrong with it. Just avoid it.",Geostorm
7,BA_Harrison,A s**tstorm.,4,16 February 2018,"Part The Day After Tomorrow, part Into The Storm, part 2012 and part every other wild weather disaster movie Hollywood has churned out since Twister, CGI fuelled meteorological mess Geostorm didn't go down a storm with audiences thanks to a wholly generic and extremely dumb plot and a lacklustre performance from second rate action star Gerard Butler.Butler plays engineer Jake Lawson, the man responsible for the Dutch Boy Program, a satellite system designed to control the Earth's catastrophic weather conditions. When the system suddenly goes haywire, Lawson travels back into space to try and find out exactly what has gone wrong before a planet-wide super storm (a geostorm) can wreak havoc around the globe.Tidal waves crashing through cities, sudden sub-zero temperatures, equally unexpected heatwaves, massive electrical storms, hail stones the size of footballs, and a silly thriller subplot in which an evil politician conspires to rule the world: this film is a predictable hash of warmed-up Hollywood clichés that never takes any chances. Furthermore, none of it makes a lick of sense, logic taking a back seat to the special effects. If all you want to see is more global destruction on a massive scale and some explosions in space, by all means have at it, but don't expect to be blown away.",Geostorm
8,paul_haakonsen,"Your average, generic disaster movie...",5,7 June 2018,"I must admit that I had my concerns about this movie because it had every indication screaming that it would be another generic foray into the disaster genre....And that was exactly what this movie turned out to be!The storyline was incredibly predictable and generic. And it was just so far out there that they had satellites to manipulate and control weather phenomena.It should be said that the cast was really good. They had some very good actors and actresses on the cast list, which includes Gerard Butler, Daniel Wu, Ed Harris, Andy Garcia and Jim Sturgess. Just a shame that these performers had next to nothing to work with.This was just as I had expected; a CGI galore fest. And trust me, yes the special effects and CGI was spectacular. There were some really impressive destructive scenes, which were awesome. Just a shame that they were few and far apart, because I would definitely have loved to see more of the destructive forces of nature. But even these scenes could do nothing to lift up that generic storyline that made ""Geostorm"".Not even remotely making it to the top of natural disaster movies, ""Geostorm"" came and went without leaving as much as a scratch on the paintjob.",Geostorm
9,CinemaSerf,"Looks good, but that's about it....",5,28 April 2020,"It's a sort of babysitter of a film, this one. Gerard Butler is ""Jake"", a scientist who is despatched to a giant space station to establish the cause of some seriously freakish meteorological goings on when the whole point of this multi-billion dollar system was to prevent the worst effects of global weather extremes. Soon he, and his brother ""Max"" - an Earthbound Dougray Scott are suspicious that there is a potentially devastating conspiracy and are soon concerned that it may go all the way to the top of the US Administration (Andy Garcia is the President, ably protected by Ed Harris). The babysitting - well that's because it has no rude words, lots of colourful and noisy explosions and a dialogue/plot that would happily engage an early teenage boy with little or no expectations beyond killing a couple of hours. It's not awful, but Dean Devlin was not wearing his creative jeans when he concocted this special effects extravaganza.",Geostorm
10,Calicodreamin,Solid action movie,6,5 June 2020,"Not bad, not great, a solid action / storm thriller. The storyline is well developed, definitely unique, but a bit predictable. Most of the acting is good, and the characters have good chemistry. Worth the watch, maybe not the re-watch.",Geostorm
11,oscaralbert,More believable than GRAVITY; more timely than 2012 . . .,8,23 October 2017,". . . Warner Bros. courageously warns Americans with GEOSTORM of what's in store for us because we ignored Al Gore. Most if not all Warner Bros. films, from the briefest Looney Tune to their longest Action\Thriller, are carefully crafted to warn the USA of its Upcoming Calamities, Catastrophes, Cataclysms, and Apocalypti. Sometimes it takes a skilled veteran Warnologist to interpret these Cautionary Tales. (This is much more rewarding and far less tedious than poring over third-rate ""quatrains"" from that over-rated schmuck, Nostradamus.) But GEOSTORM should prove accessible to all but White House Occupant Don Juan Rump's Red Commie KGB Fifth Columnist Traitor Dupes. GEOSTORM documents what can happen even under a Non-Repug President such as Andy Garcia's Democratic POTUS Palma if a Repug Mole such as Ed Harris' ""Leonard Dekkom"" is allowed to weasel in on the Coat-Tails of Power. With GEOSTORM, Warner warns us that America's clock is tick-tick-ticking toward a Final Countdown. Unless we strip all 100 million Hard-Core Repugs of their U.S. Citizenship (on the grounds of High Treason) and deport these traitors to Antarctica ASAP, Humanity will be facing its Extinction Event by the mid 2020s.",Geostorm
12,neil-476,Moderately entertaining drivel,5,8 May 2018,"Weather disasters are held at bay by linked satellites controlled by Dutch Boy software from the International Space Station. The system was devised by and built under the supervision of Jake Lawson. He was removed for being a loose cannon and his younger brother Max put in charge. Now, just as the system is about to be handed over to international operation, it starts to create weather disasters. Max has to send Jake up to the ISS to find out why.If you have seen the trailer, you'll be thinking ""The Day After Tomorrow v2.0"" because it is loaded with weather disaster money shots. But the majority of the film is a political conspiracy suspense thriller. The weather and space stuff is no more than eye candy and maguffins.First things first, the story is ridiculous, the science is arrant nonsense, and the timescale makes little sense. You might think Roland Emmerich is behind it, but it's his partner Dean Devlin who is the culprit. The half-hearted attempts to shoehorn in some emotional jeopardy (the poor boy and his dog) are particularly ineffective. This really is sheer rubbish.Yet Gerard Butler is always strangely watchable even when he's in something which makes you shake your head. Jim Sturgess as his brother is always likeable. Ed Harris collects a pay cheque. And the frenetic pace means that you are never bored.Make no mistake, this is a bad film. But bad doesn't mean unentertaining. I was entertained by this while simultaneously sneering at it.",Geostorm
13,Wizard-8,"Slick, but alternately silly or predictable",3,15 April 2019,"Knowing that Dean Devlin - who is best known for his collaborations with Roland Emmerich - wrote and directed this movie, I kind of figured what I would get before the movie started, and I was pretty much correct with my predictions. I knew that technically, the movie would be high class, from the sets to the special effects. I was right about that.But I was also right about the screenplay being not so hot. To begin with, so much of this screenplay seems familiar. The main theme of the movie seems cribbed from countless direct-to-DVD B movies from the past. Also, the characters are characters you have seen in many movies before, from their motivations to their actions. You'll be several steps ahead of both the stories and the characters at any point in the movie.What some viewers might not expect, however, is how silly the movie gets at times. For example, it's conveniently not explained how the nations of the world, even working together, would possibly be able to afford such a complex space station/satellite system, let alone maintain it. Also, it's strange that the world pictured in this movie has space technology decades ahead of our present level of technology, but the technology seen on Earth is virtually the same as it is presently in our real world. Trust me, there are a lot more silly moments that space does not permit me to get into further.I admit that the entire package put together didn't bore me, but all the same I was far from satisfied. It's no wonder this movie underperformed at the box office, even when considering the foreign grosses. The only circumstances where you should watch the movie is when you are in a really undemanding mood and you have to concentrate on another task while watching the movie. Don't fear missing any movie details while working on your task - as I said, you'll be several steps ahead at any moment.",Geostorm

I shake it off, I shake it off, i i, I shake it off, I shake it off.",2,28 November 2019,"Geostorm is an unevoking uninvolved disaster film.It should have started at an earlier point in the timeline. Instead of he did this, we did that, now we're here. As you never invest in any of the characters and it's all like a video game without consequence. Doesn't hold a candle to an ""Armageddon (1998)"" of its type. Butler and Sturgess are a poor leading combo. The premise isn't bad, needs to be done incrementally though.",Geostorm
15,FlashCallahan,Cloudy with a chance of cheese.......,7,18 January 2018,"After an unprecedented series of natural disasters threatened the planet, the world's leaders came together to create a network of satellites to control the global climate. But now, something has gone wrong.The system built to protect Earth is attacking it, and it becomes a race against the clock to uncover the real threat before a worldwide storm wipes out everything...........Geostorm is the type of big budget nonsense that used to fill cinemas in the summer 12 years ago, and would make such an impact on the box office, it would have been one of the biggest hits of the year.Think of Armageddon, The Day After..., and Independence Day. These films were huge hitters, but they came around when effects were taking a huge leap forward, thanks to the advent of CGI, so they were a spectacle at the cinema.This is cheese of the highest order, and the makers know it. When the first trailer hit screens a while ago, it was shown to be a serious thriller. Move forward six months, we have a different trailer, with rock music and jokes. The makers knew that something was wrong.But while the film does stretch beyond the boundaries of total nonsense, it's the kind of film that you can look at, laugh at, and have good old Butler doing his thing as the over the top astronaut come world saviour, who went and lived in a trailer after his brother fired him.People and places get wiped out in the same style that Quaid was up against in 2004, but this time, in 98' Avengers style, someone is using the weather as a weapon.When Ed Harris is in your film in a suit, there's no surprises for guessing who's behind it all.It's a brain numbing experience, and it deserves to be the flop that it is, but it's one of those films that beggars belief, and you'll have lots of fun when your not rolling,your eyes.",Geostorm
16,phd_travel,More of a disaster than a disaster movie,3,12 October 2017,This disaster movie starts off with good intentions with a warning about what climate change can do. We get little snippets of disaster weather wreaking havoc in cities. Then a tedious conspiracy theory plays out on earth and in a space station that regulates the weather that is going haywire. The disaster scenes seem short and TV movie like - surprising from director of Independence Day. There is a cheap feel about them. Snippets of disaster interspersed between tedious stretches. The subsequent car chase exploding space station and weather calamities all at once is just too much at the same time. Quality over quantity ought to have been in the minds of the film makers. There is a grand climax but in the end this will probably go down as one of the lesser disaster movies.Gerard Butler is okay if a bit non scientist looking. The rather unmemorable looking Jim Sturgess lacks charisma for a leading role of other scientist. Abbie Cornish is fairly convincing as secret service agent. Ed Harris plays the Secretary of State and a rather unconvincing Andy Garcia is POTUS.Not one of the better ones.,Geostorm
17,deloudelouvain,Reading some reviews I expected the worst but it isn't bad actually,7,27 February 2018,"I can get that not everybody is going to like this movie. For the budget it had it could have been better, there's no doubt about that. But saying it's the worst movie ever that's a bit over the top. I actually did enjoy this movie. It's one of those movies you don't have to think too much, just relax and let it come. The story isn't bad, I even thought for a sci-fi movie it had a nice refreshing story, different than the usual stuff we get. Certainly not realistic, not even in a far future, but that doesn't matter. I would have prefered a bit more disasters but all in all it was okay. The CGI's could have been better as well. The cast was good though, no real bad acting like some would say. So to me, for a movie in this genre it's worth a watch. I won't compare it to movies from another genre because that's besides the point. This is a sci-fi disaster movie and it's not a bad one.",Geostorm
18,SimonJack,This sci-fi thriller is okay without quality acting,7,7 September 2019,"Even with some big names in the cast, this modern-day sci-fi thriller won't hold up as a model for acting. But, with a far-out plot and the scenes to go with it of a mega-disaster theme, one doesn't need or look for great thespian performances. And, one can tolerate a couple of hokey scenes - between the two brothers Jake and Max Lawson. Gerard Butler and Jim Sturgess are in those roles. Andy Garcia and Ed Harris are the other big names besides Butler.""Geostorm"" is an edge of the seat sci-fi thriller, and it has some tremendous CGI in scenes of devastation around the world.It's no secret early in the film that espionage is afoot. For anyone who's used to films of this type, it's not too hard to figure out who the culprit is. I don't always guess right, but I nailed it on this one about halfway through the movie. That didn't diminish my interest or attention, because this film is loaded with space type sci-fi and some down to earth action. Besides, one can't be sure that a guess is correct until the end.This film didn't do well at the U.S. box office, but with its international flavor it went over big globally. It would be considered a flop at one-fourth its budget at home, but the box office worldwide was nearly double the budget. Maybe American audiences are so satiated with fast action films that many just don't appeal to audiences as much. I'm one of those who tires of the constant action themes that have so little plot and acting.But, ""Geostorm"" is better than most because of its plot, the sci-fi aspects, and some tremendous disaster scenes produced with CGI that look quite real. I am surprised that this film didn't at least get nominated for an Oscar for its visual effects.",Geostorm
19,siderite,The gall to try to sell this as a movie,4,4 January 2018,"Tommy Wiseau could not have written such a bad movie. I started laughing from the moment I saw they were using space shuttles on non reusable boosters to get to space, but then my smile faltered, because it went downhill from there. The acting is phoned in, the story is absolutely ridiculous and even the special effects are stupid. Worst of all, there is no geostorm! The title of the movie, moronic and meaningless as it is, is not about what happens in the movie, but about what they are trying to prevent from happening. All the scenes in the trailers are disconnected things that just fill in time. And it lasts for almost two hours! Bottom line: they have a cast of professional actors who can play anything with a straight face, and boy did they need it! There is no redeeming quality to this film. None! From the script, acting, directing, special effects, drama, they were all bad. The only nice part was Abbie Cornish, who is just so cute.

20,Hellmant,I had three caffeine pills (with the equivalent of two cups of coffee each) and I still kept nodding off during it!,5,8 November 2017,"'GEOSTORM': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new big budget disaster flick co-produced and directed by first time feature filmmaker Dean Devlin (who's previously co-written and co-produced such huge sci-fi blockbusters as 'STARGATE' and 'INDEPENDENCE DAY' 1 and 2). It was written by Devlin and Paul Guyot (who's also served as a writer and producer on the TV shows 'THE LIBRARIANS' and 'LEVERAGE', with Devlin). The film stars Gerard Butler, Jim Sturgess, Abbie Cornish, Ed Harris and Andy Garcia. The story deals with a series of natural disasters, in the very near future, caused by malfunctioning climate change devices, as the satellite designer, and his brother, attempt to stop them. It's gotten mostly negative reviews from critics, and it's also a big disappointment at the Box Office as well. I found it to be a pretty boring and unmemorable film as well. The story is set in 2019, after several huge natural disasters have caused massive destruction around the world. 18 countries have teamed together to build a natural disaster defense system, that they call 'Dutch Boy'. Jake Lawson (Butler), the architect responsible for the climate controlling satellites (which make up 'Dutch Boy'), is fired from his job for being a hothead. Jake's brother, Max Lawson (Sturgess), replaces him. Three years pass, and 'Dutch Boy' is now malfunctioning, by causing random natural disasters around the world (instead of preventing them). Max must now recruit his brother to help investigate the cause of the malfunctions, and stop them from continuing, before a chain reaction of natural disasters, called Geostorm, occurs. I think the movie has a good premise, which could have been used to create a cool natural disaster action flick, but instead the film is extremely routine and uninvolving. None of the characters are interesting, or fun, and even the action scenes are unmemorable (in my opinion). I was so bored by the movie that I had three caffeine pills (with the equivalent of two cups of coffee each) and I still kept nodding off during it. The film's one saving grace is Gerard Butler, who still is always amusing to watch (in almost any role he does), and technically speaking the movie is aptly directed too (there are some decent visuals in it). I think Dean Devlin is a talented filmmaker, and he seems like a great guy (I'm actually friends with him on Facebook even), but his talents are definitely wasted here. He needs to do a project that his heart really speaks to him about, I think.",Geostorm
21,thesar-2,A Global Warning to Ignore,1,18 February 2018,"Or...How 'The Day After Tomorrow' Just Became a Masterpiece.I used to love disaster films, but then again, I also used to love spoofs. The last good spoof was 2000's Scary Movie. And the last good disaster film was...was...well, maybe Dante's Peak in 1997. Definitely don't make 'em like they used to.I really wanted to give this movie an extra half star for the graphics, but even they were a letdown as they appeared in approximately 2% of this more-mystery-than-disaster-film. And I'm using ""mystery"" enormously loosely. Even the Scooby-Doo gang would refund the money and just tell the cops whodunit before the case was even explained.The one brightside of this movie, though also not enough for that half-star, was the unintentional comedy. I found myself laughing out loud more than a few times at the ""dramatic"" moments, the fact the cast obviously had no clue what movie they were in and the acting...including the worst actor I've seen in years: Alexandra Maria Lara who played ""Ute Fassbinder."" Seriously, if you like unintentional comedies like I do, she would almost be worth watching this (actual) disaster for. Almost.Following the plot of the terrible (1998's) The Avengers, there's a satellite of hate put in place to fix climate change since we really just needed a Band-Aid. But, shocker, someone wants to use it as a weapon and cause the movie's title.Aside from the horrendous acting, plot-holes, dialogue, predictability, clichés and false drama, another one of its worst traits: it's so...damn...long. I kept checking the time as the first two-thirds is just people trying to figure out the plot they may/may not have read in the alleged script. And then, FINALLY, the ""action"" starts...but, of course, as Hollywood does so much these days (cough, cough, Thor: Ragnarok,) they kept cutting away from what people actually wanted to see in lieu of the bad story and acting.Worse, when the climax finally began, there was approximately 36 minutes left and as it ended, there was about 20 minutes left. This movie would never end.I take that back. Mercifully, it did and since I survived the Geostorm, my life now has a purpose: MAKE SURE NO ONE ELSE HAS TO LIVE THROUGH WHAT I JUST DID.***Final thoughts: My jab at Thor: Ragnarok was in jest. I really did like that movie, but was enormously frustrated with its cut-aways. Almost every single time one of the 15 subplots or action scenes got good, bam!, instant transition to yet another subplot. My guess: they think, ""Well, people have seen this countless of times, so we don't need to show them this all over again...and we can save money in the process! Cha-ching!""Well, you answered your own thought there: if people HAVE seen it countless of times, make even more money by thinking of something new.",Geostorm

23,Cineanalyst,Disastrous,2,8 June 2021,"Morbid curiosity gets the best of us sometimes, and so I saw ""Geostorm,"" a movie that was notoriously bad even before its release--after poor test screenings back in 2015, followed by re-shoots and reshuffles, including bringing Jerry Bruckheimer aboard, and further delayed by schedule changes--pushing the impending disaster (of a) movie into 2017. Perhaps, not entirely unlike the political dithering and incompetence on such matters as climate change the picture criticizes. Anyways, the much-maligned CGI and preposterous scenario of satellites controlling the weather isn't the problem here, and some of the action is passable enough as far as these things go. The constant score begging for emotional engagement the movie can't earn is typical, too, if still lousy. I can almost overlook, too, that a supposed industry of world-class scientists and technicians is comprised of nobody over 50 or who couldn't supplement their income by modeling. After all, astronauts don't tend to be very old, but, for crying out loud, the crew mocks Gerald Butler--the Spartan Adonis from ""300""(2007)--for how old and worn out he supposedly looks. No wonder the world is staring down apocalypse if its leading scientist looks like he's lifted more dumbbells than books over his life, and his peers still mock his appearance.The main problem, then, is it's just incredibly poorly enacted and written. I wonder what the original cut looked like if this is the result after rewriting, reshooting and even recasting. All the brotherly quarrel stuff is garbage. Butler is mostly his usual affable self; that is, he presents the same persona he always does as opposed to actually acting. But Jim Sturgess is terrible. It's impossible to care about a character when everything he says is emphatic, bad-tempered or, when with his Secret Service girlfriend, nauseatingly cutesy. He's intolerable. So is his niece. Have the filmmakers ever met a child? They don't act or talk like this. I couldn't even pay attention to whatever she was saying in the forward and afterward of the picture it was so inconceivable. It hardly matters by comparison that the baddie is obvious from the get-go; the casting alone gives it away.On the other hand, it looks cool when Abbie Cornish's agent drives a car in reverse and, without sticking her head out the window, shoots dead the driver chasing her car....

Its lasers work well and have prevented many natural disasters on earth. But, Jake is late to meetings and has an arrogance which rebuffs Congress. Soon, they ask his younger brother, Max (Jim Sturgess), also a scientist and second in command on DB, to fire his older brother and take over. Reluctantly, he does. Jake goes home to work on green energy sources with his young daughter and Max leads Dutch Boy. Yet, three years later, the satellite begins to falter. In Afghanistan, villagers are frozen like statues. Rio has an ice storm as well while Japan experiences beach ball size hail. In Hong Kong, one of Dutch Boy's climatologists watches as the earth beneath his feet goes white hot and barely escapes with his life. No one knows what is happening so Max contacts his older bro to help figure out an answer. Naturally, Jake is still honked off. Yet, he built DB and wants desperately to prove its worth.

28,The-Sarkologist,Another Disaster Movie,3,22 October 2017,"In all honestly this is just another excuse for big budget special effects to show nature completely destroying human civilisation, and also a subtle jab at the climate change skeptics. Well, not quite because the reality is that while we might believe that climate change exists, in the end it is either in the too hard basket, or the somebody else's problem basket (which means that somebody else has to solve it for me because I can't be bothered). Actually, it might not even be that because it seems that they have solved the problem with a sophisticated satellite network, so it might even be suggesting that we don't need to worry about it because, well, the smart scientists are going to end up solving the problem.Anyway, the story goes that a system of satellites are created to control the weather, and thus solve climate change. However, while the US claims to have built it, it will be handed over to the international community. As it turns out there are some people that don't really want that to happen, so they decide to try and shut the thing down, or at least make it look like damaged goods. It actually goes a bit further than that, but that is basically about it – create a system to control the weather, and then have it break down unleashing huge storms across the globe.In the end this is basically one of those special effects extravaganzas, and I am even wondering why I bothered to even watch it. Actually, come to think of it there really isn't all that much to say about it. It isn't as if the acting, or even the story, is worthy of any awards or anything, not that those awards actually mean anything in the first place. In the end, it is probably one of those films that are simply designed to keep the masses entertained, and to also give us some false sense of hope that maybe somebody else can solve climate change without us having to do anything, or even change our lifestyles. Well, even though, despite all of the electric cars and what not, the number of shuttles being sent up into orbit seems to be somewhat counter-productive in the end.

the meteorological phenomens are too local,and are not thouroughly enough explained in the storyline why it happens. the thick density of tornadoes and lightening you may expect some sound from,and the electrical static from the blitz-weather,would have lifted the hair a mile high on the actors, but no,they are impecably well hairdressed,even though mr.harris's hair differ in each shift of camerashift and take when arrested in the end of the movie.the true timeline are severly erroinous, there mustve been teleportation devices in use especially near the end.the script deserves 1 star, and the sound work and sound effects particularly are failing alot. remember the most silent place in the universe is in the universe. the actors seems like amputees because the script doesnt function at allall in all it seems like a hurry to get finished project, and the theme as a succes factor has already been well used and elaborated. its a watchable film though,but just not good enough",Geostorm

31,tomgillespie2002,May just be one of the stupidest films ever made,3,9 February 2018,"It's been happening to major releases for decades, but nowadays near enough every big-budget blockbuster comes with its very own straight-to-DVD knock-off. Recently, cult label The Asylum have released the likes of Ghosthunters to coincide with 2016's Ghostbusters, King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table to sponge off the success of Guy Ritchie's equally terrible King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, and even Operation Dunkirk to dupe ill-informed shoppers into thinking it was Christopher Nolan's awards-grabber Dunkirk. When I first saw the trailer for Geostorm, I was convinced that The Asylum had stretched their purse-strings a tad, and that Gerard Butler had finally done the decent thing and stepped away from the big screen. It turns out that Geostorm is actually meant to be a proper movie, and that The Asylum's cash-in was in fact called Geo-Disaster.With its horrendous special effects, ham-fisted action and completely nonsensical premise, I refuse to believe that I'm the only one who couldn't fathom that this was an actual blockbuster attempt. Geostorm may just be one of the stupidest movies ever made, and the real horror is that the final product is actually the result of 15 million dollar re-shoots after audiences reacted badly to test screenings way back in 2015. If this is a result of expensive re-shoots and a two-year hiatus, then I'm almost curious to see what state it was in beforehand. I can only imagine that the original version wasn't quite as hilarious, although Butler was always attached to play Jake Lawson, the brain-child of a giant climate-controlling satellite dubbed 'Dutch Boy', so it must have been at the very least amusing. Dutch Boy monitors and influences the planet's weather after mankind has ravaged the Earth and turned it into a melting-pot of devastating storms and extreme temperatures.He may be highly intelligent, but as he's played by Butler, he's also punchy and obnoxious, and has his toy taken away from him by a Senate cub-committee after he refuses to cooperate. Jake's brother Max (Jim Sturgess) is placed in charge instead, but Jake's skills and experience in the field may be called upon again when Dutch Boy starts carrying out seemingly random attacks and threatening to cause a 'geostorm' - a super-storm of which none will survive. Abbie Cornish is also in the movie for some reason, even though she's way above this sort of schlock. Soon after starting to navigate through the unnecessarily complicated plot you will realise that very little of Geostorm makes sense, and you can probably work out who the bad guy is by reading the cast list. However, for all its utter stupidity and boring set-pieces where millions are indifferently massacred by bad CGI, I can never say that Dean Devlin's Geostorm was boring.

He has to find the mistake and correct it before it's too late for all humanity.I found this movie interesting at first but it became boring and predictable after the first half an hour. The plot twists were very predictable and you knew what was going to happen even in the end of it. The direction which was made by Dean Devlin was good and he presented very well the plot and the main story of the movie but failed on making his main characters understandable. The interpretations of Gerard Butler who played as Jake Lawson, Jim Sturgess who played as Max Lawson and Abbie Cornish who played as Sarah Wilson were good but not good enough to make this movie great. Lastly, I have to say that ""Geostorm"" is an average action movie and good enough to spend your time but I suggest you to lower your standards before watching it otherwise you will be disappointed.",Geostorm

Its big, loud, and dumb for what it is trying to be.",4,20 October 2017,"A disaster film from the producer of Independence Day tries to bring an another blockbuster cgi fest with the global world at stake once again. Plot may be cheesy but I am thinking the film is not meant to be taken seriously and enjoyed for what it is such as a popcorn flick that is loud, big, and dumb visual effects action. It does check mark all those. But Geostorm is not as entertaining or exciting. Gerard Butler has been missing his marks with films lately from the terrible London Has Fallen and so on. Its basically Die Hard meets 2012. Gerard Butler is sent to space in a weather controlling space station that stops terrible weather around the world. And a virus in the system that has been planted by someone in the inside of the government or terrorists. So they can cause a geostorm which can cause a global threat with big storms hitting everywhere around the planet. From a rapid temperature decrease that will freeze a person in matter of seconds. To huge tsunamis. To several tornadoes. And heat waves. Yes, the plot is cheesy. Not meant to be taken seriously. But the action sequences were not as fun as it is trying to be. The visual effects were terrible. For a big budget film. The budget must have went somewhere cause the cgi was bad. The acting was terrible, and the script is filled with laughable dialogue. Gerard Butler plays Jake, an engineer that is recruited by his younger brother Max (Jim Sturgess) to help fix the satellite. While Max's love interest Sarah (Abbie Cornis) works for the secret service and is on a trail of a conspiracy that someone has planted the virus in the space station. The action sequences were horrible. Its weird to see a smart car outrun a giant earth quake with the ground breaking away from the heat wave. And avoiding buildings that are being knocked down like dominos. Plus seeing all these explosions is filled with obvious cgi that looked too fake. The acting was not any better. Gerard Butler is a great guy but placed in a horrible script. The dialogue is terrible. And cheesy. Overall, Geostorm is a bad disaster film.

36,leonblackwood,"Decent concept, average execution!",4,1 April 2018,"Review:
This is another mediocre movie from Gerard Butler, who hasn't really made anything that great since 300 but his movies have been watchable and his performances haven't been that bad. This movie had a decent storyline, which touched on subjects that need to be addressed but once the politics got introduced to the plot, it started to go downhill. Gerard Butler (Jake Lawson), plays a engineer, whose head of a International Climate Space Station but his abrupt attitude keeps on getting him in trouble with head officials. They decide to turn the space station over to his brother Max Lawson (Jim Sturgess) but when the powerful network of satellites, which control the climate, start to go haywire and causes tragic deaths around the world, Max is forced to investigate. Max works out that the satellites, named the Dutch Boy Program, have been tampered with, so he calls on his brother, who knows the system inside out. He manages to retrieve some records, which show that the satellites were programmed to destroy various cities around the world, and with his brother connecting the dots on earth, they work out who the culprit is behind the world devastation. To stop the satellites causing more destruction around the world, they are forced to destroy the Dutch Boy Program but with time against them, and President Andrew Palma (Andy Garcia) being threatened by the cause of the whole problem, Leonard Dekkom (Ed Harris), the Lawson brothers go through hell to save earth. Although the CGI was pretty impressive, and the whole ""race against time"" aspect was intense, it still seemed a bit average, compared to other disaster movies. I liked the fact that they mentioned climate change, and the problems that it can cause around the world but to create a man-made machine that can control the weather, is going a bit too far. I didn't think that the cast was that great, except for Butler, Garcia and Harris and a lot of the movie was corny but it's worth a watch because it is an original idea. Watchable!Round-Up:
This is the first movie directed by Dean Devlin but he did write Universal Soldier, Stargate, Independence Day and Godzilla. For his first big budget movie, I have to commend him for making the disaster scenes look realistic but he could have done a lot more with the concept. I didn't think that Jim Sturgess was a good choice for Gerard Butler's brother, mainly because he had a distant look on his face all the way through the film, and Harris & Garcia could have been used much more. With that aside, it did bring to light what could possibly happen with the climate, if it we don't pay it more attention but the movie did drift off towards the end.Budget: $120million

37,TheMovieDiorama,Geostorm is a disaster of a film.,3,5 November 2018,"Both ice cold with its one-dimensional characters and blazing hot with its stupidity. A raucous tsunami of unappealing visual effects that never strike a balance between political thriller and global disaster blockbuster. It's hailed as an outdated illogical mess, and I for one agree. Having said that, some moments of enjoyment are to be had if you are willing to suspend your disbelief. A space station that controls Earth's weather system is being hacked and used as a weapon. It's up to Butler to save the day (because apparently no one else can...). It commences with a condescending expositional narration from a child about climate change, and how we as humans have caused this. Make no mistake, it's an important topic. But, it's never referenced in the film again. As if we're being told off and now our punishment is to watch Geostorm. The story balances a political story where NASA employees and secret service agents attempt to work out what the heck is happening, with Butler's heroic bravura as he works on the space station to also investigate satellite anomalies. The former is interesting, the latter is stupid. Let me explain. Watching agents investigate a global investigation where someone wants them dead, is slightly captivating. Witnessing a spacesuit being hacked (me neither...) as Butler attempts his best Bullock impression from 'Gravity', is not fun. The disasters themselves are tertiary, an afterthought if you will and boy do some of them look terrible, particularly the Dubai tsunami. It's another case of characters seemingly outrunning outlandish weather types whilst everyone else melts, freezes or drowns. At least the space station looks decent, so there is some hope! The culprit(s) was obvious and lacked authentic motives. Every character was one-dimensional. And, as always, Butler sacrifices himself...only to miraculously survive.

I really liked the two little mystery elements of who is responsible for what is happening in this film. A little mystery in any film is always a good thing. I also found most of the action sequences entertaining and unique enough to keep me entertained.The biggest problem with these films though is that they're all basically the same film, just with interchanging disasters. The formula is followed so closely each time that you can pretty much predict it down to a T (I think that's why I appreciated the ""whodunnit"" aspects so much). They really need to change it up in the future if people are going to keep going to these films (however I sadly fear that they won't).

Lots of good actors in this, especially Ed Harris and Andy Garcia, and even Andy's daughter was in a small role.So: It's ""just another disaster movie"". With a huge difference, the disaster is caused by something man-made, rather than earth crust displacement or Aliens or Climate Change, although Climate Change is one of the issues of this film and the reason why the technology existed.Gerard is Jack, a guy who had made a network of satellites that have given the Earth of 2019 relief from ""Extreme Weather"". A worthy endeavor, but as with anything, is susceptible to being futzed with, which is exactly what happens.But who is doing it? Initially this film seems to be taking a poke at a Democratic President played by Andy Garcia. But that's not it at all, with themes of Misdirection and mystery. And one of the disasters occurs in space, even though there are plenty of planetary disasters that might have been ripped from ""The Day After Tomorrow"", except that one of them happens in the middle of a desert instead of NYC.Dean did a good job directing something that I could have sworn was directed by the master of mayhem, Roland Emmerich. The photography is good, the effects are great, and the score by Lorne Balfe is excellent. It is not bogged down by too many pop songs.I always enjoyed being awed by Emmerich, which was why I enjoyed this, despite some flaws- Evidently, Devlin has been influenced by Emmerich for his style of focusing on a group of unlikely people that loosely interact, and that happens here.Although not the mega-hit material that Independence Day was, it fills our need to watch films about planetary disasters caused by stupidity and greed. Like The Poseidon Adventure, Towering Inferno, even older films like Crack in the World - We have a need to watch our planet being blown up, or unimaginable disasters occur on a Brobdingnagian scale. Sometimes, there was a gimmick added in like Sensurround, so we could feel the Earthquake in Earthquake. But this film did not need these, we wanted and got huge disasters, people escaping death by mere fractions of inches, but also a child surviving with his dog.But what attracts me are the themes of universal cooperation, isn't it better to have a world where all countries work together for something positive? When a lot of people of different cultures strive to fix problems, there is nothing wrong with that.The other issue, is making a film where we can take for granted that it could happen the way depicted and suspend disbelief for just two hours.",Geostorm

Realising that something is potentially wrong with the Dutch Boy program, 2 estranger brothers find they must put their differences to one side and work together to find out what has happened to the program before it can wipe out any more of the world's population...Global warming and the threat of climate change is something that has been discussed for decades and we're all being told we need to reduce our carbon footprint where possible. Therefore a film which seemingly offers a solution to such a large scale problem makes for quite an interesting concept.It's a shame really that Geostorm is presented and executed in such a uniformly dull way; whilst I understand that global warming and climate change are serious world issues the film still could have made some effort to try and at least make what we see here exciting or entertaining. Rather than do this the film feels more like a dull documentary, only on this occasion it's one that lacks any real social commentary. The film has some big hitters on board such as Butler, Garcia & Harris, but they really are slumming it here and these big named actors fail to make much of an impression; Garcia fares the worst here and just looks like he wants to be someone else. Harris does OK with what he has to work with, but he probably should have had a bigger role in the film given his significance to the overall story.The only time the film manages to generate any kind of excitement was when our attention switches to Hong Kong and all hell breaks loose. Aside from this section of the film you may find yourselves, like me, yawning, constantly checking the time and praying for the damn thing to end.",Geostorm

Boring and cliché reminding me of many other movies. Very obvious story, decent special effects for the disasters but not enough of them. I was bored and found situations laughable.

They soon discover a conspiracy in the satellites which were designed to prevent natural disasters on earth. I",Geostorm
47,kluseba,Standing your ground and protecting your integrity,8,29 November 2017,"Going into this movie, I didn't expect anything. I went to a movie night at my local cinema on a Tuesday night and simply needed to find a second film to complete my double feature. It turns out that I got much more than I would have expected from this film.The story is quite diversified and family drama, conspiracy thriller and science-fiction blockbuster all at once. The difficult relationship between the main character and his brother as well as his daughter was touching and realistic. The conspiracy included two major twists that I didn't see coming. The movie makes you believe that certain characters could be behind the conspiracy before the story takes a few clever turns. The movie obviously features a lot of vivid special effects. Usually I'm not a fan of artificially flavored CGI stylistics but they actually looked impressive on screen at my movie theatre and they were also quite diversified. Exploding gas lines, gigantic hail and tidal waves are only some of the impressive meteorological elements you will see.The film wasn't boring at any point and doesn't deserve the harsh critics it gets. It's one of the best catastrophe movies in recent memory, probably the greatest of its kind since the South Korean blockbuster Tidal Wave a whopping eight years ago.An honorable mention goes out to the opening sequence where the rough but sympathetic main character played by Gerard Butler delivers a passionate speech pointing out his team's accomplishments in front of an arrogant judge and an assimilated group of followers in form of a jury. They try to bring him down but the main character stands his ground despite risking his career. Standing up for your ideals no matter what isn't always easy and could put you into a lot of trouble but you won't wake up in the morning and feel like vomiting when you see your own face in the mirror. Integrity is worth more than any money in the world. This opening sequence perfectly represents what the rest of the movie is all about. This excellent opening sequence really struck a chord with me.In the end, ignore the negative comments and get entertained by a vivid movie mixing family drama, conspiracy thriller and science- fiction blockbuster with charismatic characters in a visually stunning way. Make sure to watch this film at a movie theater to appreciate its bombastic sound and visual effects. Geostorm truly is a pleasant surprise.",Geostorm
48,peterp-450-298716,It's not a complete disaster.,5,22 January 2018,"""Look, I know you're not gonna like it but as I see it, there's only one person to go after for this.
Your brother, Jake.""""Geostorm"" adresses an issue which is highly topical currently. The influence we have as human beings on the climate. And the consequences this has on our environment. Is it really true we'll be bathing in the shadow of the Cologne Cathedral in the future ? And will polar bears slowly exchange their winter fur for a thinner version, in such a way that after a few decades they look like oversized hairless Sphynxes ? Or will we be continually plagued by natural disasters that'll cause a multitude of victims among the population? The same problems are presented in ""Geostorm"". Fortunately, they had more visionary spirits and they joined forces worldwide. An immense network of satellites spans the earth and scientists can always intervene in a focused and coordinated way (from the ISS), in case of out-of-control weather conditions. Until some things start to go wrong.""Geostorm"" is a typical disaster film. There are some advantages while viewing this type of film. You can leave your brains at home because they aren't really necessary. If you have to pee urgently during the film, you don't need to watch the rest of the film with squeezed buttocks. It's like a daily soap on television. If you miss something, you can still follow afterwards. But be honest. When you're going to watch a movie like ""The day after tomorrow"", ""Twister"" or this one, you don't expect deep and ingenious written dialogues. You want to see impressive images with masterly designed digital effects on the screen. Not? The more dramatic and devastating the disasters are, the more successful the film. The footage of disasters on our planet aren't always impressive and baffling in ""Geostorm"". But the images from space, look incredibly realistic and enormously intense. You thought the images from the ISS space station being pulverized in millions of pieces in ""Gravity"" were impressive? Well there are some sequences in ""Geostorm"" that look even better.The summoned actors aren't the least either. Gerard Butler is not the best choice to play the part of the highly intellectual scientist Jake Lawson. I don't think people see Butler as a person with an extraordinary I.Q. (although I'm not saying he's as dumb as an ox). Physical efforts and situations where muscles are needed, fits better with him. And there's plenty of that in this film. Jim Sturgess plays his brother Max. You can't say their relationship is really friendly. But as expected, this improves as we approach the end of the film. If you want to see Sturgess shine as an actor, you better try ""Upside down"". Abbie Cornish looked familiar to me and that was because I saw her shine next to Woody Harrelson in ""Three billboards outside Ebbing, Missouri"" a week ago. Finally there's also Andy Garcia as the president of the USA. And Ed Harris as the secretary of state. Not that it really matters how legendary some actors are, because the overall story told here really is a disaster.""Geostorm"" isn't a brilliant film. Sure, the movie isn't completely boring. But there will be a few things that'll annoy you. If it's not the cliché content or the lousy, uninspiring dialogues, then surely the used special effects will cause annoyment. Because they are sometimes aweful and outdated. Like for instance the scene where an area was flooded by water and all of a sudden the water retreats. It felt as if it was filmed in a bathtub and suddenly the stopper was removed. And the U.S. behaving as if it's the big savior of the world again, was enormously irritating. Especially when you realize they are currently the biggest deniers when it comes to global warming and certain agreements and guidelines are simply boycotted (every proposed measure gets opposition from the American Petrol Industry). You can't say it's all politically correct. But you shouldn't expect something like that either when watching a simplistic spectacle film which was made solely for entertainment.More reviews here : movie-freak.be",Geostorm

52,rgkarim,GeoPower! This Storm Is Stronger Than Expected,7,21 October 2017,"There are very few things scarier than a natural disaster. What would happen if that power could be harnessed by humans, manipulated to our whim in order to keep our world acclimated and functioning perfectly? Could such a thing be used for good, or would it merely be repurposed as a weapon? This question is the key concept in my next movie review, titled Geostorm, the latest disaster flick to ""storm"" into the theaters. Pun aside, Robbie K is back for another overview, so let's get started, shall we?LIKES:The Sound: My first like is the incredible sound editing Geostorm contains within it. These editors ""blew"" me away with the fantastic renditions of Mother Nature's torment, capturing all those destructive sounds and unleashing them into the theater. Lightning filled maelstroms, horrendous fires, and bone chilling ice storms all drop with mighty blow, causing the theater to rumble in delight. This effect may not seem like much, but it really rounds the experience out and immerses you into the havoc. The Visuals: No surprise here, Geostorm's visuals are also beautiful displays of technology. We know this genre is all about making disasters look real, and this film brings that power out with little hesitancy. Watching destruction unfold is breathtaking, as the terrifying mayhem of the manmade storms unfold, helping you experience the horror without actually being there. Geostorm's displays, although limited in number, are the selling point of this film, especially during the exciting moments when our characters are trying to navigate their way through the destruction. Acting: Sometimes these disaster movies tank on the cast, resulting in whiny, nimrod characters who are asking to be sucked up into a twister. Not the case for this film. Geostorm's cast is actually fantastic in bringing their characters to life, and also brings an awesome team to the mix to diversify the genre. Gerard Butler was a solid choice for the lead, combining action gruff with scientific strategy to craft a tough as nails character to lead the project. This dynamic nature made a fun hero to root for while seeing him evolve past his flaws. Jim Sturgess does a bang-up job in his role as well, playing the role of the neurotic congressmen forced to choose between family and job. His character required a much broader class of emotions, and he manages to hit all of these with little trouble. As for the female leads of Abbie Cornish and Alexandra Maria Lara, these women were incredible displays of girl power in the modern world. No super powers needed here, for these women have intelligence, ferocity, and heart as they tackle all the demands this movie placed on them, and all with a realistic touch. I wished they had utilized them a little more, but they maximized their screen time. The Story: Despite how cheesy it looked, Geostorm's story was better than I expected. The characters have some backstory not lost to the storm, requiring them to grow much like the threat of total cataclysm. During the actual presentation itself, Geostorm is nicely divided into four sections each occurring simultaneously and playing important roles to the dilemma at hand. Throw in a little mystery to figure out the culprits, and you have a more engaging story line than we typically see in these films. All in all, they managed to execute this ridiculous concept quite well for me. DISLIKES:Storm moments: Despite the promise of major cataclysm, Geostorm is surprisingly bare of storm sequences for much of the movie. Many of these scenes are in the background, with only a few having that thrilling, on the seat edge. In addition, despite being thrilling, these moments get a little too ridiculous, the sheer unrealistic maneuvers violating the science without the technology to do so. While I appreciate, the disasters fitting into the movie, they still needed a little refining. The Predictability: Geostorm tries its best to throw you off the trail to the culprits, but the trailers and obvious foreshadowing will give you the answer within the first 30 minutes. In addition, the fate of other characters is not surprising at all, mostly because they figure things out minutes within the film. Had it not been for the visuals and exciting pace, the story would have been drab and put me to sleep. I'll admit there was a nice little uncertain moment, reminiscent of a few other flicks you are certain to remember. Past that though, it's a predictable mess indeed. Underutilized team: Like many films, our protagonist becomes part of a special team in charge of fixing the problem. Unfortunately, after the introductions, most of the team is essentially useless save two members who actually get more screen time. While not as bad as the gang from Wonder Woman, this group just didn't feel needed in the grand scheme of the picture and could have been utilized in a more conducive environment to add a little more suspense in the mix. Either that or cut the characters to help the budget. The VERDICT: Despite the cheesy idea, Geostorm was a welcome change to the natural disaster movie collection. Stunning special effects, a Sci-Fi Esque story, and dynamic characters are certain to entertain fans of this genre and bring with it a nice twist. However, if you are looking for a storm movie, you need to pick another tale as the disasters are a minimum or overly cheesy to be believable. Throw in some weaker story elements and predictable plot, and you further weaken the storm they were trying to bring. Overall not a bad film at all, and the special effects are more than worthy of a theater visit. Otherwise check this one out when it hits home release.

53,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Geostorm,6,24 October 2017,"2017's Geostorm is my latest review. It was initially shot over three years ago but that doesn't really diminish its quality. Geostorm is a disaster film and yeah, I'm a sucker for that kind of popcorn fury. You wanna see random cities get destroyed by hail storms, tidal waves, and millions of lightning bolts? Geostorm's got your back. You wanna see denizens parish from molten heat and from being flash frozen? Geostorm will give it to you. But wait, that's not all. Geostorm doesn't just have the weather as its only antagonist. There's also a creepy Secretary of State playing government cover-up by implanting a computer virus to destroy the planet. You just know that Geostorm is then gonna have vapid car chases, some fistfights, and some gnarly shootouts. Hey I can dig it. In truth, Geostorm is a little intense for PG-13 fare. I remember getting the same feeling watching people burn to death in something like The Towering Inferno (a disaster trope that today could have been rated R). Guess what, you've been warned as a moviegoer.For what it's worth, I almost decided to recommend Geostorm. What can I say, it surprised me. Call it science fiction fodder with ideas as opposed to just relying on chintzy special effects. Geostorm creates its own, unique world in which satellites control the Earth's climatic overhaul. There's also a sense of fragility and peril when it comes to Geostorm's take on natural disasters. Geostorm's logic is hokey yet weirdly fascinating. Its scenes of destruction are partial yet boldly intense. The critics have been lambasting this thing every since it came out last Friday. Frankly, they just need to chill.Now where would I rank Geostorm in the disaster porn canon? Well it's better than Deepwater Horizon, better than Into the Storm, better than 1979's Meteor, and much better than 1974's Earthquake. However, Geostorm is not quite on par with Cloverfield, The Day After Tomorrow, and Deep Impact. So OK, I'd probably put it in line with something like The Core. There's a flick that I'd also saddle with a strong, mixed rating (hint, hint).Anyway, Geostorm is distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures and features a musical score straight from the annals of Michael Bay. Added to that, Geostorm chooses the cities of Rio, Orlando, Florida, and Tokyo as candidates to bite the proverbial dust. In the casting department, Geostorm stars scruffy Scot and ICSS commander hero, Gerard Butler. Listen, I believe Gerard to be a decent actor. I really do. The problem is that his agent keeps putting him in movies that are critically panned on a dime. Geostorm inhabiting that kind of movie (this isn't my opinion), puts Butler in the position of being the poor man's so-and-so (Harrison Ford, Bruce Willis, Mel Gibson, take your pick). It's a shame. Heck, flicks like Playing for Keeps and The Bounty Hunter won't get him any closer to the Academy Awards either. Oh well. Butler is the heart of Geostorm and he does a bang-up job. My overall assessment of this motion picture: 2 and a half stars.",Geostorm

55,bkrauser-81-311064,"Geodude, this Geostinks!",5,22 October 2017,"There was little doubt this thing was going to be a turd. For three years now the trailer for Geostorm popped up on movie screens and on the internet with the frequency of a dandelion before it was unceremoniously plucked from a well manicured lawn. Because of extensive res-hoots, this thing has been shelved more times than expired beef jerky at a disreputable gas station. Now with it finally out; we all finally get a chance to chew on the rancid teriyaki tinged aftertaste. The question remains: is Geostorm, the story of a malfunctioning network of weather satellites threatening to devastate the world, really all that bad? Well, no, no exactly. It's not particularly good, but with The Snowman and Tyler Perry's Boo 2! out in theaters this October, Geostorm may by default be the best wide release movie this weekend. I know scary right?! A Gerard Butler helmed disaster movie that literally cuts and pastes pieces of Independence Day (1996), The Core (2003), The Day After Tomorrow (2004) and 2012 (2009) is now, generally speaking the best new flick you can watch at the Cineplex? Not since The Blind Side (2009) got glowing reviews has the world felt so backasswards!Geostorm does have a couple of things in its favor from the get-go. Not the least of which is everything borrowed from better disaster films are tropes that have transcended cliché to become virtually ritualistic. Will there be pompous politicians realizing - only too late of the consequences of their actions; yup. Will there be city wide devastation unfolding before the POV of minor characters holding their mouths agape; of course! Multiple malfunctions culminating in a literal time clock with a self-destruct sequence being activated; umm check. Will the dog survive? The velocity in which all these long favored clichés hit you is not unlike being overwhelmed by a tsunami. It's like watching a sizzle reel of stuff going ""boom"" real good but without small stuff like story getting in the way. Geostorm even chucks in a couple of throwbacks including Butler playing the kind of rugged, altruistic uber-scientist we haven't seen since the atomic age. And with such strict adherence to formula, audiences are guaranteed to figure out the entire conspiracy at the center, the moment someone with arched eyebrows shows up and asks ""how can I help?"" In that regard this movie isn't so much an original piece, as it is a sing-along. One in which a certain audience is liable to belt out melody.If however, you take out all the borrowed bits, Geostorm is a failure for all the regular, boring, humdrum reasons: bad acting, bad writing, bad pacing, bad directing and bad editing. First time director Dean Devlin obviously holds a torch for Roland Emmerich's oeuvre but his overuse of digital technology and generic camera-work lacks tactility and starves most the senses from anything truly exciting. The screenplay hangs a lot of its emotional baggage on a go-nowhere sibling rivalry that could have worked had they cast actors beside Butler and Sturgess, who look about as related to each other as a tangerine is to a hailstone. Then of course there's Geostorm's overt political message which is as clumsily executed as a 4am tweet.It all adds up to well-meaning but terrible movie that's no different than its influences and arguably did itself no favors by delaying its release date. Here's a fun hypothetical, if this truly is the best version that can be sluiced out of the silt then why not release it without the re-shoots and re-edits? Than it wouldn't have just been bad, it would have been shockingly bad and therefore worth a watch. As this is the finished product we got, the world may be better off if you just skip this one altogether.",Geostorm

Central to the problem of the drama is the reducing of a fantastical story to an implausible evil plot by one person to murder millions on the premise of 'doing the right thing'. Special effects are deployed without any background of tension and with no reasonable cause and effect, giving it a low budget low qulaity SciFy Channel TV movie feel.

62,Prashast_Singh,A gripping disaster film.,8,6 July 2018,"GEOSTORM is quite underrated in my opinion. While it's true that the film is not very groundbreaking or outstanding due to its simple execution, it can't be denied that the film packs a solid punch with its action sequences, plot twists and visual effects. Even though I didn't want to compare it to other movies of this kind I have seen, such comparisons were inevitable. But trust me, GEOSTORM is an entertaining disaster film. If you're looking for some extraordinary stuff, then this isn't the movie to watch. But if you just want to be entertained for less than two hours and leave the seat with a sense of satisfaction, you should definitely see it. It's an action movie sans any melodrama, and is exciting in many ways. The action is excellent and the visual effects are dazzling. Editing is good as the film has been cut at a decent duration and holds your attention for the most part. Cinematography is decent. Performances are quite good.GEOSTORM addresses an important issue of how we need to save our own earth. The new concept of disaster blended in the film is decent.

65,sergelamarche,Fun disaster,5,7 February 2019,"The storyline was a bit better than regular movie disasters. It had disasters, heroes, evil bandits, plosions, evil weather. What's not to like?",Geostorm
66,phubbs,Geostorm,6,12 March 2018,"Oh my what do we have here?? Did we suddenly quantum leap back to the mid 90's??? So, its 2022 and technology has apparently advanced quite a bit. The Earth is now surrounded by a man made net of satellites which can basically control the weather. Up in orbit there is also an international space station that controls said net of satellites. Bottom line, its a global effort by mankind to try and protect the planet (of course when I say global that doesn't include every country, ahem). There's just one tiny problem, not all humans are nice, not all humans are on the same page. And so the net (called 'Dutch Boy' in reference to an 1865 fictional story) is hacked and used to cause natural disasters around the world. Enter the net designer Jake Lawson (Gerard Butler), who is tasked to solve the problem and essentially save the world. The end.Some of you might think this is just a silly disaster flick, and you'd be right to a degree. But this movie is in fact more of a political thriller mixed with a disaster flick element. The natural disasters we see are in fact triggered and created by the man made satellites, which are in turn started by the evil saboteurs. So its not really man vs mother nature, its man vs man using mother nature as a weapon. To be truthful the idea isn't actually that bad, its just a bit dated. A Pierce Brosnan 'Bond' plot type of dated.Luckily everyone in the movie acts so seriously, so butch and stoic with their grimaces and steely eyed stares, you can rest assure that everything will work out just fine. Obviously our tough hero Jake Lawson won't die, you think he might (and really he should have, multiple times), but he doesn't. But its really quite amusing and so very 90's how the actors deliver their lines which such ridiculous levels of attitude; trying their best to look and sound as cool as possible as they glare into the camera. I think Jim Sturgess (Max Lawson) is the most guilty of this. He really shows-off all the cliched action movie facial expressions and poses. Its like everyone watched 'Armageddon' before they started filming.That being said what do you get? Well pretty much everything really, the full gamut of disaster porn. Huge tidal waves, electrical storms, massive hailstones, a firenado, a freezing ice storm, the ground being torn open to reveal what I presume was lava etc...There are lots of sequences which show innocent people getting killed in lots of various ways; including massive carnage to buildings and property.The action is of course all CGI which ranges from good to average. Whilst the sequences in space look totally fine but nothing amazing, they are by far the best looking parts of the movie. Almost all of the disaster action on Earth looks like CGI. To top that the sequences all look like they've been copied and pasted from other movies such as 'Deep Impact'. You wanna see city skylines get washed away (or frozen, or knocked over) by giant tidal waves? Its all here folks...again. The actual action is simply predictable. Again from seeing other disaster movies you can pretty much guess what's gonna happen. But one of the main issues with the action, like other disaster movies, is the fact its all so utterly stupid. Whilst trying to obtain a piece of data lodged in the space stations structure via a spacewalk, Jake's spacesuit goes out of control. He is flung all over the place crashing into the space station causing massive amounts of damage...yet he and his suit remain perfectly intact. On Earth whilst natural disasters are occurring specific characters are able to avoid the carnage around them and outrun pending doom in a car. How many times have we seen that? Then in the finale Jake and his new fellow scientist lady friend are both able to avoid masses of space debris flying around as the space station blows up around them. They both make it to a remaining intact satellite (via spacewalking I might add) which also manages to avoid all the deadly debris.Then to top if all of nicely the last intact satellite pod (why would a satellite be able to house two adult humans inside?) is picked up by a space shuttle...that just happened to be flying by? Seriously was this shuttle just off to the side waiting for the explosion to happen and subside so it could search for potential survivors inside satellite pods?? And while we're at it, why couldn't the self destruct be turned off?? The reason for having one was valid enough, but what about an abort option people?? I also found it quite cute how the person in charge of a countries satellite seemed to be from that country. Like, would NASA (or whoever) go to the trouble of finding a Japanese person to put in charge of the satellite that controls Japans weather?? So the Peru satellite is controlled by a Peruvian person, and the Nepal satellite is controlled by a Nepalese person etc...I mean I know political correctness is hyperbolic these days but Jesus Christ come on!Despite all that nonsense I gotta be honest and say I actually quite enjoyed this movie. It did exactly what it said on the tin. I was engaged and I found it quite exciting even though it was highly predictable. Yes its not a great movie, but its nowhere near as bad as people are making it out to be. I've said this before about certain movies, had this been released around 1995 or 1996, I think it would have been a reasonable hit. It would have fit in perfectly for the era, although it might have suffered from genre overload.

68,rockman182,Geostorm (2017),5,21 October 2017,"As soon as the trailer dropped I knew this film would be a joke. In recent years, Gerard Butler has become a king of being in hammy, corny, films so I knew this would be just about the same. I actually do like global disaster films no matter how cheesy the films usually tend to be. I knew not to expect much and just sit back and enjoy large scale cinematic disaster. After viewing the film, I am actually disappointed. The film stays too focused on its political themes, conspiracy, and character dialogue than something that should focus on its disaster element.The film is about a scientist who has to travel to space to fix 'Dutchboy' a satellite network that controls global climate in space. However, someone has been manipulating the satellites causing large scale climactic disaster around the world. The mystery runs deep basing itself on a political level. Its up to the scientist and his once estranged brother to save the planet from a geostorm that is threatening to destroy the planet in its entirety.The film does not offer enough disaster, straight up. I enjoyed 2012 (through its stupidity) because it offered many scenes of global destruction. This film shies away from it and only offers it in doses. Its the main reason anyone wants to watch the film. Yet we are subjected to far too much character moments, an on the nose political agenda, and a very generic political conspiracy that is actually really easy to solve. You've seen it all before, you will leave the theater completely forgetting the experience.You can see why this film was in developmental hell for a bit, there's just not a whole lot going on that can warrant your attention. Gravity did all the space scenes better and this film felt like it wanted to rip a few scenes. The actual disaster from weather scenes look nice but as mentioned before they don't come often and do little to add to a film that doesn't have a whole lot else going for it. I didn't expect much but still managed to be disappointed.5/10",Geostorm
69,RforFilm,Geostorm is nothing but 90's disaster film clichés and science that make Sharknado look credible,2,23 October 2017,"Disaster movies seem to be a genre that few can get right. Not that they're unpopular, as the late nineties through the 2000's gave us a ton of those. But while audiences may have gone back to them each summer to catch the latest crisis that threatens a city, critics rarely praise them. Even mass audiences seem to be aware of how crass they are. I'm sure if I were to name Volcano, Deep Impact or Independence Day, you'd probably tell me that one of them a guilty pleasure of yours. I'd be lying if I said I hated these, but it's clear that proper storytelling an compelling characters take a backseat to the real star, the special effects. One thing that's changed is that the blockbusters we have now contain all sorts of special effects. A giant tornado or a hail shower isn't going to look as impressive as Iron Man or magic come to life. Another is that people are more likely to consider just how many could die in a disaster movie situation. Finally, audiences are going to eventually want more variety and disaster movies tend to take the same route. Geostorm is so bland and generic of a disaster movie that you'd wonder if it was written to be a parody. Due to climate change and global warming, scientist Jake Lawson (played by Gerard Butler) creates a series of satellites that connect to a system called ""Dutch Boy"". This can deploy anything to stop major weather like hurricanes, tornados, and even control temperature. Because Jake is a rebel who doesn't think the UN should be in charge of these weather forces, he's booted off while his brother Max (played by Jim Sturgess), who works for the white house, is given charge.A couple of years later, the UN starts to notice the Dutch Boy malfunctioning. They send Max to his brother Jake to go into space to figure out the problem. As Jake gets there and is introduced to the ships commander, he see's that there's been a lot of glitches that is being perpetrated by a terrorist hacker. Meanwhile, Max and his girlfriend secret service agent Sarah (played by Abbie Cornish) start to uncover a plot from the inside of the white house that may have to do with the Dutch Boy. Perhaps president Andrew Palma (played by Andy Garcia) or U.S. Secretary of State Leonard Dekkom (played by Ed Harris) might know what to do. Where do I begin with Geostorm? Probably that it uses all the clichés that we've seen in every nineties disaster movie like the crisis bringing the family together, government officials that don't believe the scientists, the rag-tag group of heroes, the rebel who doesn't like authority, and more. This movie adds nothing new to any of these. The special effects look neat, but are unimpressive, look cheap, and don't make sense half of the time (why does a satellite need a death ray? How can Dubai become flooded with water only for it flush into nothing?)When it's not clichéd, it's very boring, with a lot of science talk that I'm sure that any scientist will be happy to debunk. I'm no meteorologist, but I'm sure you can't get rid of a hurricane by blowing up wind. You'd think that the movie would at least play up the actions as campy. Nope, everything is treated serious. I'd like to meet the scriptwriter who seriously thought that he was crafting something original. This isn't even good enough to be a sci-fi Channel original movie. At least Sharknado embrace the insanity of the idea and had fun with it. I'll give this two satellites out of ten. It's hard to tell who would like this. Kids maybe, but I'd think they would find this too boring. Disaster movie fans may get something out of the special effects, but would still find a lot more from other movies. The only thing that may be a saving grace is that it could make a star attraction for a movie night. Geostorm is definitely one of the worst of the year. Skip this storm.",Geostorm

72,juliankennedy23,It's a disaster all right.,5,22 March 2018,"Geostorm: In Geostorm the earth has suffered massive disasters due to global warming. The countries all get together to create a vast spiderweb of satellites that all have magical powers to control the weather. Our hero Gerald Butler, who single handily invented and constructed all the satellites, is fired cause he tells it like it is and now the United States is ready to turn the satellites over to the world at large, but someone has taken control of the satellites and are making then do bad weather instead of good. Can our disgraced hero find out who is behind this and save the world in time?The Good: Well it's better than The Core. Abbie Cornish is pretty good as the fiance of the brother of the hero who is also the head secret service agent protecting the President who might be the traitor and who is the only person who can reboot the satellites. She easily has the best action scene in the movie.The Bad: Good lord where does one start. Well, let's start with one scene. Gerald Butler our Mary Sue inventor/action hero/tell it like it is the guy is going back to the space station he designed (and apparently built... with scraps... he found in a cave.) Keep in mind he is going back to the station he was fired from very publicly only four years ago. He meets with all the department heads of the station. None of them know who he is. Not one. He is the most famous man on the planet, he built the station they are sitting in, he only left four years ago, he flew up to the station in Space Shuttle like five minutes ago, he called this meeting, and he is wearing one of those Mr. Goodwrench shirts with his freakin name on it and the movie tries to do one of those OMG it's you moments.Geostorm has the trying to prevent the disaster plot rather than the much easier to script trying to survive the disaster plot. It takes a tight script and a skilled filmmaker to make a preventing a disaster film work. (God help us but Armageddon is a good example of the former while 2012 is a good example of the latter.) Geostorm doesn't have a clue. The science makes zero sense, The space station has a self-destruct button you can't turn off, the satellites are basically magical shooting heat death rays at Moscow and causing earthquakes so severe there is an 800-foot tsunami in the Arabian Gulf. Heck one of the satellites opens up to a luxurious two-person escape pod in a grown worthy moment that stands out in a movie chock full of them.Gerald Butler is awful and simply acts as if we would rather be anywhere else. Since he is in almost every scene that proves problematic. The rest of the cast, outside of the excellent Abbie Cornish, are well... there. The disaster scenes are decent (better than The Core but nowhere near the level of say 2012) but they don't really produce any tension since it is people you have never met before running away from admittedly decent video game graphics.In Conclusion: Geostorm is almost more famous for the endless bumping of its release date, the expensive re-shoots and budget overruns. I expect a movie about the making of this film would be more exciting than the movie itself. Heck, even a movie about one of the two disasters at the beginning of the film that prompt this whole satellite building scheme would have worked better. I am a softy when it comes to disaster films. Some Syfy movie where a school bus full of kids falls into a sinkhole can keep me entertained for ninety minutes. I also genuinely enjoy Gerald Butler movies more than most. This, however, failed to win me over. Still better than The Core though (Seriously who puts a windshield on a drill?.",Geostorm
73,bankofmarquis,Cheesy fun,5,25 October 2017,"As a child of the 70's, I grew up watching cheesy Disaster Flicks like THE TOWERING INFERNO, EARTHQUAKE and THE SWARM (if you wish to see Henry Fonda slumming it, check out THE SWARM).  So, I eagerly anticipate - and am rarely disappointed by - any new Disaster Flicks that premiere.  Films like SAN ANDREAS, 2012 and THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW all brought their own special charms of cheesiness to the proceedings with the melodramatic performances that are a hallmark of these sorts of movies.As I was watching the latest Disaster Flick - GEOSTORM - there was this scene early on...An unnamed computer kid was tapping furiously away at his keyboard.  He stops with an astonished look on his face, the camera pans into him as the music swells and he exclaims with the earnestness of youth ""Oh my God, it's a GEOSTORM!""I knew I was in good hands.And GEOSTORM delivers exactly what one wants in these sorts of films - an over-the-top, earnest, ""can do no wrong"", hero - in this case it is Gerard ""We are Sparta!"" Butler.  A flimsy scientific explanation that one just has to ""go with"" (I mean, really, a Geostorm?).  A somewhat major star ""earning a paycheck"" - I'm looking at you, Ed Harris & Andy Garcia.  And over-the-top contrived circumstances that puts our stars in danger by the...GEOSTORM...that would have been easily solved if ANY of the characters had a modicum of common sense.But where's the charm in that?Director Dean Devlin is no stranger to this sort of fair, having written the original INDEPENDENCE DAY, and he runs a fine line between fun, danger and parody - and for the most part succeeds.  Butler, as the hero, is ""fine"" (he's really not my cup of tea), but he doesn't get in the way like, say, The Rock does in SAN ANDREAS,  Jim Sturgess (CLOUD ATLAS, 21) is completely forgettable as Butler's younger brother who is put in charge of Butler (you see, Sibling Rivalry tension!).  The highpoint for me was Abbie Cornish (SUCKER PUNCH) who knows exactly what type of film she is in and relishes her role as filmdom's most unlikely Secret Service Agent (not unlike Denise Richards as filmdom's least likely Nuclear Physicist in THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH, but I digress...) who actually has the best ""kick-ass' scene in the movie and, darn it, if she doesn't deliver the goods in that scene.  And then, of course, there is Harris and Garcia, who seem to be looking around for the pay window and their accountants, so they can cash their checks and go buy that Villa in the South of France.All in all, a cheesy, schmaltzy, melodramatic Disaster Flick that I enjoyed every cheesy moment of.Letter Grade:  C+ (it really should be a ""C"", but my inner 14 year old is giving it an extra point)5 (out of 10) stars -  and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Geostorm
74,spookyrat1,But Seriously Folks ... !,4,7 December 2019,"Geostorm would have to take the award for the silliest movie storyline I've had the ""privilege"" of seeing for a very long time. I'm totally over disaster movies and this one is the proverbial straw that breaks that poor camel's back, not just because of all the recycled plot lines and ideas from earlier movies, but more from the sheer audacity of various producers and studios daring to actually present such idiocy to the cinema-going public under the guise of entertainment. I guess there's a market for stuff like this (Calling it pop-corn entertainment is to exaggerate its social value). Otherwise why would these same various studios spend the equivalent of a small country's GDP on producing this pap.One of the (many) bad guys is absolutely correct late in the film when he exclaims, ""Well of course if you're going to play God and control the weather, someone like me will want to weaponise the means."" Yes, it's sometime in the future (we never find out exactly when) and somehow the world/USA/UN/God knows who? has developed the science to control the world's weather through a vast array of satellites controlled from a gigantic international space station manned by hundreds of people from across the world and serviced by a fleet of space shuttles. But a conspiracy sees the bad guys want to use the technology, yes, to take over a brave new version of the world, after it's been Geostorm remodelled.This is one of these braindead movies where stuff happens just purely and simply to establish a given plot line. At least movies such as Star Trek have got the good sense and grace to at least give us an idea of how the world has changed, when they open portals into the future. Geostorm doesn't or can't be bothered. The writers would dreamily like us to think that everything they show is possible by tomorrow, so the world they show is exactly the same as ours, except for 1 or 2 more electric cars on the roads (which, btw are the same too).The character sub-plots are exactly the same as you've seen in any number of other disaster movies (""Dad promised to come home!"". Estranged brothers! (over pretty much nothing). Career power couple having not enough time for one another. Oh yes and mustn't forget the old reliable. Conspiracy against the POTUS! But for much of the movie, you feel you are being conned, just to be set up and watch a bunch of various disaster porn, which again, we've seen many times before (tsunamis, tornados, ice storms, fireballs, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes etc.).I really don't mind Gerald Butler. But he's making a habit of starring in and producing movies with these extremely nonsensical story lines (London Has Fallen is almost as silly as this, but still has aways to get near this one.) He sleepwalks through Geostorm and what's more doesn't even really try to hide the fact. Abbie Cornish is my favourite character as a senior Secret Service agent, who suddenly comes to life towards the end of the movie and in the best scenes gets to kick a fair bit of male butt. Andy Garcia plays POTUS. I only mention him, because, yes, I like him too, but he gets the best line in the movie, which he gets to utter in a hijacked taxi, believe it or not.The action does ramp up late in the movie, where there's a bit more of the spy stuff, rather than the absurd, contrived SF and disaster material. But some studio head honcho, somewhere needs to draw a line in the sand, contact his peers and say NO MORE to apocalyptic weather event movies. The world has been sentenced to enough of them.

77,jrarichards,Patriotic Brits need not bother ... and they won't be missing that much!,6,15 March 2018,"To begin with the unforgiveable, Dean Devlin's ""Geostorm"" resembles ""The Last Ship"" in allowing, indeed welcoming, the idea that a scientist with a Union Jack on his uniform is ready to betray his team, and indeed the safety of the whole planet, for money. While Brits have been bad-guys in films for years, this is going too far, and I regret spending money on this movie as I do not accept that my countrymen should be treated in this way ... AGAIN!As it happens the ""Brit"" here, Duncan Taylor, is in reality played by Irishman Robert Sheehan (and indeed his accent is slightly phoney as we experts can tell). It's actually a tiny comfort that no Brit actually took money to go along with this anti-British scenario...Beyond that, are there any comforts to be had from ""Geostorm"", which flashes a bit of a warning sign by its length alone? It's ""only"" 109 minutes long, which is not a lot of time to fit in a story as ambitious as this one would like to be. And indeed, corners are cut repeatedly, and we don't get that many ""bangs for our buck"" here, so ""Geostorm"" makes far less of an impression than, say, ""The Day after Tomorrow"" or ""2012"", which both seemed to have more time to tell their stories as those stories required. On the other hand, ""Geostorm"" does try to throw in a whodunnit thriller plot, which works on occasions, though cannot be fleshed out as it might be IN ANY WAY, given the need to keep the story of climate-change destruction going as well. While Gerald Butler as rough scientist with a heart of gold Jake Lawson mostly has very little to offer here, a bit of fun is to be had with his brother Max (Jim Sturgess"", as teamed up with two very capable and sassy women, Sarah Wilson of the Secret Service (nicely portrayed by Abbie Cornish) and State Department geek Dana played ably by Zazie Beetz. And while we're on these creditable more minor performances, a good word can also be put in for Talitha Bateman who does all that might be expected of her ... and more, in the role of Jake's young-teen daughter.Andy Garcia does slightly better as the President than does Ed Harris as Director Dekkom.But all this is clutching at straws a little. ""Geostorm"" has a few good ideas in its basic plot, but squanders them rather sadly. The space scenes are clearly expensive and look pretty convincing, but the ""crazy weather ones"" only very occasionally so. Obviously, there's a worthwhile ""be careful about global warming"" message in there, but this is also diluted rather, as - sadly - is each main strand of a film that tries but fails to draw on several different genres at one and the same time.",Geostorm
78,abisio,A very decent thriller on a sci-fi background disguised as a disaster movie,9,28 October 2017,First of all do not be fooled by the trailers; GEOSTORM is really a thriller on quite believable SCI-FI scenario. An international space / satellite based system created for control climate and to avoid the impeding disaster of global warming. After a successful launch; government officials take control of the system firing the project head. Three years later accidents start to happen killing many people so the main scientist is convoked and sent back for an audit. It does not requires a lot of thinking to understand there is a conspiracy somewhere and that one of those old but great actors must be the culprit. In any case; the movie pace never slows down to let you think about the obvious and to stop being entertaining.There are some very well orchestrated special effects and some not that good and perhaps unnecessary and some interesting twist keep the movie interesting In brief; good fun with some interesting ideas (others could have been improved) but anyway is fun to watch,Geostorm
79,kuarinofu,It's not even that entertaining,5,4 February 2018,"I love trashy B-movies with huge budgets like Independence Day and disaster movies like The Day After Tomorrow, 2012 and stuff. I mostly enjoy them for what they are - stupid little movies with huge budgets, because I love the feel they give you. Like in TDAT, you can absorb the atmosphere, the global scale of disaster. And even though all of them show stuff that is impossible to happen.
That is not the case with Geostorm though. The premise is ridiculous but it would've worked well if they would boost it with some creative content. But there's not that much of it here. It never lets you feel what's happening, since the first half of the movie has almost nothing interesting going on, and the ending features isolated incidents that don't really connect and come more as cartoonish then realistic and scary. This fails as a disaster movie.
Surprisingly enough, the main leads actually acted like they cared, when most of the supporting cast was just having fun and it showed (like Andy Garcia). I'm not sure though if that was intentional and it was a some sort of parody on Trump (the film mentions one of the crew members being Mexican specifically). So, probably the movie just played it in a clever way. It was also nice to see Ed Harris, he wasn't trying too hard but it feels like he just can't fail when it comes to acting, he always comes out good.
Overall, the movie dumped some of the typical cliches (like in 2012, ID, ID:R, tDAT) but still ended up inventing new ones. The story has very little sense and motivation so there's no reason to care about what's going on. And even still, the movie fails in being at least entertaining and atmospheric, and this is where you know your well budgeted disaster movie sucks.

84,virek213,Worldwide Weather Wackiness Courtesy Of GEOSTORM,7,26 October 2017,"It would be fair to say that a lot of the apocalyptic disaster films of recent decades, even after the potential horrors of global warming and extreme weather events had come to light, have certain credibility problems and plausibility issues that always pass muster with the studios but wouldn't do so with scientists that actually study things like that. Previous disaster films from the 1970s, like EARTHQUAKE and THE TOWERING INFERNO, didn't exactly have this problem. But there's no question that they are often spectacular to watch, which is, after all, the point of such films to begin with, whether it's films like THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, SAN ANDREAS, or ""2012"", each of which are modern-day extensions of the 1970s disaster craze taken to an extreme. And then there's GEOSTORM.The film involves an international cadre of orbiting satellites known as ""Dutch Boy"", monitored from the International Space Station, which are somehow capable of controlling the world's weather in an era of extreme climate change. But when it appears that system is somehow failing, and extreme weather events are becoming even more extreme, the man (Gerard Butler) who designed the Dutch Boy program and was replaced three years before by his younger brother (Jim Sturgess) is forced back into service to find out what is going on. Beginning with the entire population of a village in the desert of Afghanistan somehow being frozen, the weather starts to go progressively more haywire by the day. Gas main explosions in Hong Kong, ice storms in Tokyo and Rio di Janeiro only make the situation more important for Butler, who is also starting to come to terms with both Sturgess and his own daughter (Talitha Bateman). As it turns out, the whole Dutch Boy program, which was an international project, was about to become wholly run by the U.S. government; and it is in fact being sabotaged from inside the White House itself, possibly even by the president (Andy Garcia), as he has the biometric codes that control Dutch Boy. While Butler and the I.S.S. crew try to fix a problem that's quickly coming up towards the dreaded Geostorm event, it is up to Sturgess, a Secret Service agent (Abbie Cornish) and a tech expert (Adepero Oduye) to find out who the saboteur actually is.Dean Devilin, who both directed and co-wrote the screenplay for GEOSTORM, is no stranger to films of this kind, having collaborated with spectacle master writer/director Roland Emmerich on a ton of similar special effects-laden films in the past, such as INDEPENDENCE DAY, the 1998 versions of GODZILLA, and the 2016 reboot INDEPENDENCE DAY: RESURGENCE. In the case of GEOSTORM, Devlin has taken a page not only from his former mentor Emmerich, most specifically ""2012"", but also from more plausible films like DEEP IMPACT and TWISTER. Where he slips to a fair extent is in the notion of a whole program of satellites in orbit somehow able to ""control"" weather events around the world. It's an implausibility that the film can't really get around, simply because nobody would even try to do it without having an unintended deleterious effect akin to playing God with billions of people's lives hanging in the balance. It is bad enough, really, just for Mankind himself, by his extreme addiction to carbon and fossil fuels to so create the kinds of weather catastrophes that keep happening with ever more frequency and extremity. Why potentially make it even worse with a global network of weather-controlling satellites that are susceptible to sabotage? Even so, in other ways, the film works in showing how these horrific meteorological events are bringing both Butler and Sturgess, who have been estranged for one another ever since the U.S. government took Butler off the Dutch Boy project, back together, along with Sturgess developing relationships with both Cornish and Oduye, as well as Butler strengthening his relationship with Bateman. Had Devlin put a little bit more attention into those aspects of GEOSTORM, the plausibility problems might have been eased, and thus the issues of story and humanity wouldn't be so overshadowed by the special effects, which are admittedly quite good in whatever format the film is shown (regular; 3-D; or IMAX 3-D). Fortunately, however, Butler, Bateman, Sturgess, Garcia, and Cornish do more than enough to overcome most of the plausibility problems and Devlin's penchant for trying to one-up Emmerich. GEOSTORM may not be a masterpiece, but it is a fair bit better than most 21st century Hollywood spectacles.",Geostorm

88,CANpatbuck3664,Not Bad Enough to be Funny but Not Good Enough to be Entertaining,4,28 January 2018,"Disaster movies need to get just a couple of things right to make them entertaining. The first is decent special effects, when you want to see stuff get destroyed, its better if it looks relatively plausible. No one is asking for a completely accurate rendering but we all get some enjoyment from movies seeing the skyscrapers get toppled or Dubai getting flooded. Geostorm has the budget but it can't even produce eye-catching special effects. The premise (even if it is stupid) frees up all these possible scenarios for unique carnage but most of the disaster scenarios look fake or they only show generic events. This should have been the easiest thing to accomplish but most of the big scenes left me shrugging my shoulders or checking my phone.So, if the effects can't carry it, maybe the cast can. Good actors and actresses elevate bad material all the time. Regrettably, most of the cast in Geostorm is miscast or flat out bad. Gerard Butler is in the first category. He's been good in other things (even if he's made his share of flops) but no one is going to buy him as a scientist. He clearly doesn't know what he's talking about and he can't do anything with the material because its crap. I didn't like Jim Sturgess at all, his fraternal rivalry with Butler is just them yelling and pointing at each other and Sturgess needed to be on point to sell his weasel of a character. Abbie Cornish and Ed Harris are both sleepwalking through this and Andy Garcia wasn't effective because they give him the same old lines to utter as the President of the United States. Alexandra Maria Lara is okay, but her character's entire job is just to back up Butler's character. The one performance I did like was from Zazie Beetz as Dana. She's not in it enough to pull this movie out of the gutter but she at least was funny and had some charisma.In this kind of movie, you also need characters to root for, so you're emotionally invested in someone getting out alive. Again, the movie fails, Jake and Max are both selfish pricks and the creative team made a big mistake having the movie rely so much on their friction as brothers. Jake and Max's past is covered by exposition dumps and that makes them even more boring as characters Sarah has no depth, she's even called secret service barbie and why should we care if she can't be with Max? Andrew is a boring president, we don't get any idea why he's a great leader until the plot requires him to step up. Ute is fine but she's bland. We also get introduced characters when the individual events are going down but the time that we spend with them is so small that its almost impossible to get attached.I don't want to get into the science of Geostorm, critics have already hacked it to death and while it is ridiculous, I was willing to look past it if the movie could be good outside of it. Outside of flooding, tornadoes and the occasional giant ice storm, Geostorm boils down to a mystery about who is hijacking this global weather controlling system to wipe out specific parts of the population. I like a good mystery, but the movie does itself no favours by the casting of specific actors. As soon as I saw one of the actors, I called him being the culprit and I hadn't been watching the movie for more than 20 minutes. The story just starts out running down the nonsense hill and by the end it fell and broke its legs. The ending left me shaking my head and laughing when that was clearly not supposed to be the desired reaction.I can offer very little in defense of Geostorm. I can't praise the effects because they weren't believable enough to sell me. The plot was too nonsensical to be interesting and all the characters were too shallow or stupid to invest in. There was the odd good performance but that's not even close to being enough to recommend this. The idea of geoengineering is fascinating but the way they decide to use it to anchor the film was just wrong. Geostorm was a flop for a reason and I can't even persuade myself to recommend it as a guilty pleasure. Unless you must see every disaster film out there, its better to leave this one alone.",Geostorm

99,stevenrotherforth,Seen it! Done it! Got the T shirt!,5,23 November 2019,"GeostormDean 'the Disaster artist' Delvin returns with yet another carnage fuelled fun ride entitled 'Geostorm.'
Sadly though the fun seems to have been left behind and swept up by the bad weather in yet another cliched effort.
Delvin is proving to be a one trick pony.
He once wowed us with 'Independence Day' but now it's a case of ""Seen it, done it, got the T-shirt!""'Geostorm' tells a ludicrously silly story of weather gone haywire. Humans fix the problem with a network of satellites that can control the climate down on Earth.
Without this creation that is named 'Dutch boy' (this was explained why but to be honest I wasn't paying attention) the weather goes catastrophically out of control causing global disasters.
Scientist Gerard Butler ( yes you read that correctly, Butler plays a scientist) must save the day when 'Dutch Boy' is sabotaged and turned into a weapon of mass destruction.Ok so I understand that this is a take your brain out to enjoy type of movie but you would have to remove your brain and flush it down the toilet for this film to be any good.
It's not the silly story that's the problem it's the unimaginative retread of better movies from the 90's.
Sure this effort has better special effects than those of decades gone by but no amount of visual splendour can save this film from the humdrum.
It truly is a case of 'Seen it all before!'
So much so that when the VFX carnage kicks off you'll find yourself glancing at your watch or scrolling through Facebook on your phone.
To add to the bland and banal. The characters are forgettable and this makes the audience not care what happens to them.
When disaster strikes the audience aren't connected or even remotely interested in the fate of those onscreen.
'Independence Day' had memorable and likeable characters so we cared about what was happening.
Not so much here. Apart from Butler none of the cast strike a lasting impression. There's a subplot about Butler's character and his brother but it's tedious and cliche.
In fact the most entertaining part of the movie is the beginning when Butler's character is verbally battling a bunch of government officials in a court room environment.
That's not saying much for the millions spent on special effects.'Geostorm' is a film that is ok as background noise.
Something to watch whilst you prepare dinner or do the ironing. Not really what was intended for a movie with a budget of one hundred and twenty million dollars.",Geostorm

To make matters worse the entire project are about to be turned over to ""the international community"" which of course is a well known recipe for disaster.Hollywood lives in their usual dream world of course so they throw in suitable, old-fashioned, bad guy with the ""correct"" political views for a bad guy and with an outrageous and apocalyptic plan and we are all set.Let's ignore all that crap and focus on the movie. Once that nonsense is out of the way what is left is a fairly entertaining science fiction disaster thriller movie. The special effects are not bad and the movie moves along at a decent pace. The ""raison de etre"" for this movie is the action and the special effects so the story and the acting is adequate and nothing more.Unfortunately, as is all too often the case, the story writer is a bit of a low watt bulb. This satellite network that is the foundation of the movie is fairly unrealistic even for a science fiction movie. Let's forget about the total insanity in even trying to cover the planet in a network of satellites that are actually physically connected, the feats that these satellites achieve is just so far off the realism scale that is is annoying. What the heck are powering them? Anti-matter, black holes? This could have been done much better.Then we have the self destruct sequence that is playing a large part towards the end of the movie. What kind of self destruct blows up a few bits and pieces for show and then pauses so the characters can run around for half an hour or so?

104,Mike_Devine,A disaster in and of itself,1,21 January 2019,"Disaster films are a mainstay of modern-day cinema. And while some stand out from the pack (think 2004's 'The Day After Tomorrow' and 2009's '2012'), others crash and burn faster than a comet careening toward a major city. 2018's 'Geostorm' is exactly the latter.The film can be categorized as a colossal, big budget disaster itself. Everything about it was ill-conceived, from the script to the story, the cast to the CGI. Instead of focusing on the events that are taking place on earth, 'Geostorm' gets lost in its own politics in a ""holier than thou"" attitude. Yes, climate change is something that should be taken seriously, but to build a whole (terrible) film around it to teach audiences a lesson will probably instead teach hollywood the lesson of not wasting money on efforts like this.But it's really the acting that is most egregious. From Gerard Butler's sniveling and angry outbursts as the head engineer of a global galactic climate system who must come out of retirement to save the earth once again, to the C-rate performances from Jim Sturgess and Abbie Cornish, no one is safe from the horrible script. Even Ed Harris is hung out to dry in his portrayal of the defense secretary. But it's not just the dialogue and the script. It's the actual acting - just so bad.

Everything about this movie was a cliche, it had weak characters, and it's predictable, but I still enjoyed it. I don't think that Geostorm is a good movie, but Geostorm is a good movie to watch if you just want to see some destruction. I think people take this movie a little too serious, although this movie does act like a serious movie.Story: 5/10The story is obviously ridiculous with satellites being able to control the weather. The one thing that truly bothered me was why would they make the satellites so dangerous. Why would they program tornadoes and beyond freezing temperatures, I guess to make the film more interesting. Another little issue is why are there still modern technology if it's in the future, maybe it's not that far into the future, but it would take hundreds of years to make something like satellites controlling the weather. The one thing that I can say is how creative it is. Instead of nature disasters, like in the movie 2012, it's about how people did it to themselves. I initially thought that it was a terrorist or someone wanting power that was overriding the satellites for their own reason, but it was the government that did it. The story was pretty boring, the only thing that was good was the idea of controlling the weather, everything else was a cliche, like a character dies before explaining something or the protagonist escapes from an explosion. The story overall was weak, with too many cliches and a predictable ending.Characters: 3/10The characters are beyond weak. I really didn't care if one of the protagonists died, they were so one dimensional. All of the characters had at least one cliche. And the brother relationship was lackluster, maybe they wanted a lackluster relationship between the brothers to show how different they are, but if not, then they did a horrible job. The boyfriend girlfriend relationship between Max Lawson and Sarah Wilson felt so forced and cringey, and even their names sound cliche. The movie also tries to be funny, by adding comedic characters, but the jokes aren't funny, it's so painful to watch the comedy because of how unfunny it is. Overall the characters are all cliched, unfunny characters, and forced relationships.Action: 6/10Geostorm is a disaster movie so it relies heavily on the CGI, in some cases the CGI isn't that bad, but sometimes the CGI looks horrible. I really can't hate on the CGI because it is hard to create so much destruction and make it look real. I really did enjoy the action. Geostorm took so much elements from all these disaster movies and put it into one. There wasn't too much action in the movie, I think there was a perfect balance between the action and the drama. I think Geostorm could've been better if they had another protagonist like a family member that was actually in the disasters, I think if that character was done well, then it would've made Geostorm a little more thrilling. The action was decent overall, it could've been better if there was a little more thrill when the disasters started happening.Geostorm is a movie that you can hate on for hours, but if you just have some popcorn and a drink, then you can enjoy it. There are a lot of issues with the movie that makes it hard for a movie critic to say ""I had fun watching Geostorm, so I'm going to give it a 5/10"", but if you're a moviegoer that loves to see destruction, then Geostorm is the movie for you, despite the problems.",Geostorm

Now I love a good disaster movie, no matter how badly made, and after seeing the trailer for this film I thought we had the next step on from The Day After Tomorrow or 2012, I was not altogether wrong, but I was far from right. Without giving anything away the world comes together to create a solution to bring the planets' out of control weather systems back into some kind of order. This is done using a massive network of satellites controlled by the International Space Station. When one of the satellites malfunctions it cause a weather anomaly on the ground which is reported as tragic, but when more start to fail suspicions are raised and it seems something more sinister may be at work. We have as the head of our group of heroes the marvellously enigmatic Gerard Butler, who plays the man who invented the whole weather controlling system. Saving the world is written into the script but there is also an underlying story of a man unable to fit in the world and form a meaningful relationship with either his brother or his daughter. Although incredible corny in parts,this film is exciting and totally unexpected in its delivery. Once again the biggest stars are the guys in charge of special effects.

The entire DNC did get blown out in one of the 'storm' events so I guess POTUS will need some new voters. Even the special effects were pretty pathetic and lacked imagination.

The opinions differ only on what makes a good one.The president of the USA, far-reaching conspiracy, the world in danger, a few good (wo)men doing what is right, impending big disaster - if these keywords fit your cup of B, then ""Geostorm"" may have what it takes to entertain you for 109 minutes and leave a good aftertaste.When the network of satellites designed to control the global climate starts to attack the planet instead, it's a race against the clock to uncover the real threat before a worldwide geostorm wipes out everything and everyone.Most of the story actually takes place in space, so considerable part of the visual effects budget has been spent to show us the International Space Station, satellites and the big cold void that we like to call the universe. And after having your fill of ""cosmos p*rn"", there are big natural disaster scenes to fall back on.The disasters dominate the promoting materials but are actually in minority, and mostly mercifully short. They look awesome but are not essential to the story and thus tend to even somewhat disrupt the general atmosphere and flow. Especially near finale, which is mercifully short too. Because good entertainment should always know when to end and not stretch over two hours or something.Starring Gerard Butler - the unsung hero and go-to guy to any self-respecting B- or generic movie - who is joined by a surprisingly large and impressive cast including Jim Sturgess, Abbie Cornish, Talitha Eliana Bateman, Adepero Oduye, Ed Harris, Andy Garcia, Alexandra Maria Lara, Daniel Wu, Eugenio Derbez, and Amr Waked.It's also worth noting that almost all major female characters are written as strong individuals and don't rely on their looks (although they do look good of course).This approach is something that freshens and updates the general vibe reminiscent of the big dumb 1990's movie that the director and co-writer Dean Devlin became really famous for originally, meaning ""Independence Day"". Back then, of course, he was just a writer and co-creator with Roland Emmerich, here he debuts as director too.But cool actors, strong female characters and even big-budget special effects will only get you so far, when the movie is lacking the most essential of elements: heart.And ""Geostorm"" has a lot of heart, which is the main reason I liked and enjoyed it so much - in spite of its weak storytelling where things mainly happen because they are ought to, not develop naturally.It's a minor miracle that despite all the unrealistic-ness and cheesiness of the story - it's a B-movie, after all - the actors are so spot on, full of heart and conviction that you just have to buy all this what's happening on screen.This is probably thanks to Devlin's brilliance at putting together this kind of big cheesy thing. It was about time he started directing too!Leading star Gerard Butler, in some movies just a poor man's Aaron Eckhart, is in especially good form, a shining example of how to breathe life into otherwise generic material, and grab us along with the ride.If you think that spouting all these silly lines and making it feel believable must be easy, as it seems for him, then you should try acting for youself.In a way, his charismatic work here feels as much an achievement as Matthew McConaughey's in ""Interstellar"" which is actually not the weirdest association if one was to compare the central themes of the two movies. But if this comparision seems too out-there, there are also parallels with many apocalyptic blockbusters from ""Armageddon"" to ""The Day After Tomorrow"".So... I liked it. ""Geostorm"" is certainly cheesy, but it does what it does really well. Go catch this!",Geostorm
115,jb_campo,Predictable B- grade movie,4,9 December 2018,"I always go into these world destruction movies with cynicism. Geostorm fails to succeed on many levels. The plot was right out of James Bond with killer satellites. Gerard Butler as our hero does what heroes do. Poor sub-plots with his daughter to try to make it seem like this was a movie with a pulse, or that cared about a storyline. At least you could relate to Butler and his brother fighting with each other.But otherwise, nothing much there. Whenever I see a certain actor in these films, you always know he's the bad guy, because he's now been typecast that way. So again, no mystery. Andy Garcia seemed miscast as the President, but he did an ok job. The acting was average at best - actors played their roles and the script didn't inspire any outside the box performances. All very standard B grade acting.The hero of the movie was the CGI demolitions of various towns and places. The ending was completely Hollywood predictable. All told, it was predictable, B-grade plot, B grade acting, Hollywood destruction flick. At least it came in at around 100 minutes, which was the only saving grace. Not much more could I have taken.
Let the buyer beware - Geostorm is below average and 100% predictable.",Geostorm

A few produce light chuckles. A few more produce audible disdain.Gerard Butler has a few redeeming moments, the rest of the time, he's bad, ditto for Ed Harris and Zazie Beetz . The rest of the crew have none.Abie Cornish was never hot, but, she was pretty. Casting her as a tough girl didn't work at all, and she doesn't look pretty.Jim Sturgess is terrible. Unfortunately, he does not overact, to make it somewhat interesting, he just acts badly, all he does feels very unreal and forced.Which brings us to a major point - it's not even ""so bad it's good"".

There are heroes from all kind of nations and I personally do not know enough about climatology to judge if the postulations the story is based on are nonsense or not - and I think it does not matter much if they are, since it is about the aforementioned message, and it does come across. And to add some small things: I am happy that the dog is saved, the only scenes I did not like too much were the - admittedly trope/generic - scenes of Butler/Lawson cheesily saying goodbye to his daughter etc. - but these scenes can be found in any disaster/action movie like all the Bruckheimer movies, Armageddon etc., therefore not a reason to refuse this movie.

On earth he looses his job on this weather station, and when system fails they have to get him back on the team to save the world.This just does not make any sense.

They get the news that they have one hour and a half before there will be a Geo storm. She watches the back of Gerard's head when she hears the news. Why? His emotions are written on the front of his face. Why looking at someone else when you hear such news? Doesn't she have emotions of her own?Weard movie, bad acting. Especially from the girlfriend of Gerard's little brother. God what was she awful to watch. His daughter was crying because the space center exploded. How did she know he was not with the crew in te space shuttle?There is so much hunger in the world. Stop wasting 120 million dollars on this kind of movies.

The acting was of course subpar as expected from a natural disaster flick involving space stations and advanced technology, a classic Hollywood style action movie, nothing surprising whatsoever. Since it is a 2017 film it sadly had to include a lot of political corectness and so called ''equality'' towards women and ethnic minorities making some scenes very ''pushy'' without any related context. Also, the plot twist regarding the ''bad guys'' was very dumb and blatantly played out as if the plot was written by a middle schooler, nothing interesting or believable there, once again. Overall, just another rather expensive sci-fi flick that will maybe be remembered by kids who are 10 years old now just to be rewatched in their 20s to come to a realization it was just another stupid childhood film, that seemed extremely cool, because of some explosions and spaceships, we all had movies like that, didn't we?",Geostorm

It combines extreme weather, space, climate change technology, a political conspiracy behind technology and plenty of effects and action. Quite a layered film, without silly parts, with an idea with a fairly solid basis (worsening weather in recent years), a film that although it does reach Armageddon (does not have the dark and extreme environments of the meteorite, nor the very strong feeling and Bruce Willis's interpretation), is not far from it.

The acting was pretty horrible from all the actors, the plot could have been good but ""shoulda coulda woulda"" as some would say, the CGI is terrible 95% of the movie and the predictability score is at 99%. A complete mess.Gerard Butler plays a character that they spend 5-10 minutes explaining that he's not good at following orders. They could have easily cut more than half of that and our perception of the character would still be the same. Butler plays an engineer(?) that solved the climate on earth by activating some space-stuff in space. Cut to some years after he got fired and Butler's brother in the movie is the supervisor(?) of the space-stuff, but get this, something about the space-stuff has malfunctioned causing terrible weather on earth, and guess who will save the world? You guessed it, Gerard Butler. Butler is sent there and then finds out that someone has been uploading a virus(?) to the space-stuff, causing the extreme weather on earth. Then the space-stuff explodes because of the virus, Butler has to stay behind in space and die. Meanwhile, on earth, the president is the only one who has the kill codes for the space stuff so he must be protected. Then someone tries to kill the president, but they don't succeed. Then the brother on earth cries because his brother is probably dead due to the explosion in space. The end...I'm kidding. They sort of, like, get a SOS-signal from a small space-thingy that Butler rode on, so Butler didn't die, hooray.That's the movie, basically. I didn't include the extreme weather parts, because who cares? Half of the world froze, burned or was flooded, but at least Butler's character is still alive!

151,feyipuk,"One planet, One people, but only America can save us.",3,7 July 2018,"The introduction/setup to the film is basically what it says in the story line:
""When catastrophic climate change endangers Earth's very survival, world governments unite and create the Dutch Boy Program: a world wide net of satellites, surrounding the planet, that are armed with geoengineering technologies designed to stave off the natural disasters.""And from there it plays out like so many other jingoistic, Hollywood dramas. The plot holes are bigger than the storms, the biggest one basically coming in the first five minutes; while it says no single nation could tackle the issues of climate change alone and that all these governments united - with scientists from 17 countries (with China and America taking the lead) - to build the system; America is the one running the show, seemingly without a need to communicate with these other nations about what it does! If you can believe that, then don't worry about the science behind it all.From that point you can sit back and enjoy the CGI safe in the knowledge that ultimately, all American Jake Lawson (Gerard Butler) will succeed in beating the crap out of a bunch of rogue satellites and return to a heroes welcome not seen since the end of Independence Day!There are plenty of explosions, a couple of well shot car chases and some pretty dramatic set pieces to keep the movie chugging along. Character development is minimal; Sarah (Abbie Cornish) and Max (Jim Sturgess) work well together in a sort of Die Hard style (though Sarah never yells ""yippee ki yay""), while Jake and Max are brothers separated by more than just the 250 miles to the nearest satellite, but that relationship doesn't get as much coverage.Given climate worries, Geostorm could be seen as a film for our times; dramatically showing the effects of climate change with some big names to add a more commercial appeal.

Abbie Cornish is hot, but not much else. Talitha Eliana Bateman is Butlers cliche super-smart annoying teenage daughter who gives amn annoying speach at the beginning and again at the end of the movie. Andy Garcia is the US president that for some reason always have to appear in these type of movies. At least he dont give any dumb patriotic b.s. speach. But the fact that the kill-codes for the satellite named Dutch Boy is biometric, as in the presidents fingerprints and eyes, is really dumb. Because if the president is killed there is no way to shut down the system. Ed Harris is the predictable badguy. Unfortunately he doesnt have much to do here. The special effects are awesome and the actionscenes are fun. Except from the mistake that they always make: sounds in space. There is no sound in space. It's cliche that everytime people are killed in these movies it's always asians. Including Cheng a chinese scientist that escapes the weather in Hong Kong but not the badguys in America. But at least the satellite system that saves the world from the changing weather (that apparently kills millions in one day and nearly destroys the planet in 2019 (thats a few months from now, really??) is an international effort. Not just americans saving the world. The danish flag even made it as one of the participating countries on the space station. Im from Denmark. So thankyou for that. Even though this is fiction.

But tonight, I was bored and found it on Crave TV so decided I'd watch it.The simple answer is that it is bad in most ways. Plot is poor, the director didn't know what to do with the movie, weather disasters were mild, every stereotype was pulled out. There was nothing new in this movie: We've seen it all before:*Don't kill boy and dog
*Make easy distraction to kidnap the president
*Car chase with tiny, ridiculous car
*Trust me over all of your training and experience
*The very obvious mastermind is trusted by someone who should know better
*Main character sacrifices himself but really doesn't as there is the very unlikely alternativeYet the mess that it was, kept me watching. Sure I paused it to go get stuff which I couldn't have done in a theatre so that was helpful. Was this a space movie, political intrigue, environmental disaster movie or what. No one seemed to know. And moralistic at many points in the movie especially the young girl's voice over at the end. It would seem inconceivable that the world would continue with this project after what happened. And certainly the USA would never have been forgiven even if it was a rogue group within the government. If they did it then why couldn't it happen again.I do like Gerard Butler in most movies but in the last 5-10 years he's not been making very good ones. There is nothing in his performance that makes you think he is a scientist. Maybe a tinkerer. Maybe a mechanic but not someone who could design this type of system. And his portrayal of a father showed no emotion.I will admit I was held to the movie more because of two secondary characters, who had some good lines but were still very underused: Zazie Beetz and Robert Sheehan. It took me awhile to recognize who they were and if I had seen the movie when it came out then they likely would have held no appeal to me. But since they play Domino in Deadpool 2 and Klaus in the Umbrella Academy respectively then it was good watching them in something earlier.If the movie is free and you don't have anything better to watch, this is good filler. The negative thing about watching on Crave is that they still have a terrible control situation so it is difficult to fast forward through some of the worst shots.",Geostorm

But maybe not for 500 years or so, if we last that long.. But given that small detail..Critics hated it - too passe and predictable no doubt - but I thought the movie had reasonable entertainment value, I was expecting far worse. Human elements - father-daughter concern, romance - and some nice glimpses into near-future tech. 
Conspiracy involving POTUS and biometrics. Our hero (Butler) lives to be be reunited with his daughter and brother against all odds.Bloopers: The space shuttles (with curved wingtips like modern airliners) still had the big fuel tank adjacent the crew compartment instead of latter being on top like the upcoming Space Launch System. In the car chase scene, a small self-driving car is able to roll a vehicle about twice its mass with little effort.Disasters are so over the top they do little to encourage credibility. No doubt people would be bored by the pace of real climate-change disasters like glacier retreat, Greenland becoming so very much warmer over the last couple decades. Things like people being frozen in mid-stride by air which would have to be hundreds of degrees below zero, giant multi-funnel tornadoes, tidal waves able to knock down skyscrapers (whereas a real tidal wave is slow and relentless and mabye on 10 m high).

There is no life, no passion, the movie does neither breathe nor climax and it does not posess brain or heart. This is a zombie that has basic motor functions, but no purpose, no destination. If you really want to find something lively, you might want to talk about the ecologic message, which I very much agree with. Our world is about to die and we need to start thinking about it.

Then, disaster struck : those satellites were suddenly acting out of control causing tornados, tsunami, massive gas leak explosion, hail storm, lightning, sudden temperature drop, etc. and guess what? it was all part of a big conspiracy by the higher authority, which was solved only in one and a half hours.so what about the action sequence the trailer promised you would see in the movie? yep, they were there, but the conspiracy took more action than the storms with accompanied by a sequence of cheesy dialog about how your family is important, how this conspiracy will destroy the peace they've been keeping since the construction of the satellites, the shitty motive behind the main villain's action and bla bla bla until the movie ended with a happy ending.so I suggest you save your money for a better movie, and next time you see dean devlin (or roland emmerich) on the director's board, ignore the movie, no matter how mesmerizing the action or destruction scenes you see in the trailer.",Geostorm

The satellites accomplish this by some combination of freezing things, cooking things, and making huge waves. How? I don't know. I think it has something to do with lasers. Gerard Butler is responsible for building the system, but he gets kicked off the project - but you don't really blame them, because he really is a jerk. His brother takes over the project, and Butler disappears until three years later, when ""something goes wrong"". He's brought back, and because a whole three years have passed, no one seems to recognize him. There's a plot, but not really. They try for a twist, but if you don't figure out who the bad guy is, you're either stupid or you've never seen a movie. Nothing makes sense, and the laws of physics are entirely ignored. They re-shot large parts of it to add more tension that has no reason to be there. So you're left with a movie that makes no sense whatsoever, so you sit back and enjoy a special effects thrill ride - except you can't because the special effects are few and far between.

The first act in the movie was boring and slow, nothing significant happened. The second act's mystery plot was predictable, zero interest, and no intrigued. The third and final act's mystery unfolded itself to reveal something I felt was mundane and mediocre. By the time everything was finished, I had zero interest in most of characters and events that occurred throughout the movie. The first act explained how the satellites worked and how they protected the earth from its own weather, the explanation was believable in context. The second act set up the mystery part which was my least favorite. By the time the mystery was set-up, I had already figured it out. I realized that by this point, I'd been patiently waiting for the action to transpire. One random action scene occurred during the middle section of the film, it felt out of place. After the believable opening, the predictable mystery, the third act picked up, the action kicked in, and I was satisfied. Hannah Lawson played exceptionally by Talitha Bateman was great in her role. Every scene with Talitha Bateman was exceptional. I enjoyed Talitha Bateman's on screen chemistry with Gerard Butler, their family relationship was believable. Abbie Cornish was great here as well, my second favorite character. I didn't care about any other characters here because there wasn't any real development with them.

The shield from Highlander 2. The nefarious computer virus that can end the world from Black Hat. CGI of skyscrapers being tossed around from San Andreas (along with some ex-wife drama too). The The pending ""total destruction of earth"" from 2012. A knock off of Cade Yeager who has a precocious daughter who has a lack of prospects until asked to save the world. Well, you've stumbled on the film where you will find all of that stuff -- ""Geostorm"". It's a formula piece. Find a piece of eye candy to be the male lead -- he's there for the women, don't be fooled. Not one male in the audience is going to identify with this guy acts like a d**k to his brother, get's in fist fights like a hooligan, and is a text-book neglectful father. Add a dose of ""save the world"", but make sure a woman is in the background to save him. Pile on the CGI frosting. Take some pot shots at the U.S. government, say, blow up a Presidential convention center. Throw in a dose of hot female cop / secret service agent / fill-in-the-blank, with a dweeby boyfriend and relationship issues that will be ironed out over several life-and-death action sequences. Add Asian and African-Americans with just enough lines to stamp ""multi-racial"" on the film. A US hit -- not so likely. A global money maker... apparently that's all it takes to turn $135MM into $221MM when your Hollywood and the world is begging for your low brow escapism, the same way Americans can't get enough low quality Chinese goods. But the movie isn't THAT bad. The acting is solid. You can't question that Gerard Butler did the best with the material he was given. Zazie Beets captures the laughable ""millennial"" persona so well that someone needs to launch a comedy film franchise around her. The story is cohesive, mainly because there aren't many layers of significance... the earth is going to end and they need to stop the space station computer. But there are no pretensions about delving into HAL territory. The plot is stretched thin enough with the dual-protaganist framework that you can give it a pass when a hole or two appears in it's logic. Like the fact that there is no way to spin a moving automatic care and start cruising backwards to shoot at your pursuers without dropping the transmission. So unless self-driving cars have started coming with manual transmissions (nope, they don't), we just have to fogettabuttit. You will not emerge from this film a better person. You will not experience any catharsis. As an exercise in humanities, it is devoid of merit. However, as an excursion into a reverie about global warming, the role of men and women in science as well as politics and security. Even the vilian reveal is handled in a predictable but satisfying way. When the film ends, it's like you got off a roller coaster that didn't shake you up too much, didn't make you loose your lunch, gave you a little bit of adrenaline input, and basically took your mind off the boring reality of day to day existence that you paid the price of admission for.",Geostorm

I saw the ratings for this one on imdb and I couldn't believe the low score, so what follows... my first review ;)We saw the movie only because of Gerard Butler, I was not convinced that guy would go for something low budget à la SyFy-channel or accept a bad script. And we had a fun ride.
Ok, the relationships don't go as deep as in other classic disaster movies (titanic, twister, deep impact,...) but there's just friction enough. I found it even refreshing it wasn't about divorce papers the day before disaster strikes, etc.
You want good effects, a fluent movie with some pace in it and pending disasters, just relax and enjoy!",Geostorm

188,DaRick89,More middling fare from Dean Devlin,5,13 November 2017,"Dean Devlin has a long history of producing sci-fi and disaster flicks that place visual spectacle on the holy grail to the detriment of almost everything else. It is therefore unsurprising that he would direct a film which impresses visually but falls short in most other regards, and that is exactly what Geostorm does. In fact, when I was watching this movie with friends I couldn't help but think how similar this movie was to a typical Devlin/Emmerich film. It was to my utter lack of surprise that I discovered when the credits were rolling that this movie was directed by Dean Devlin. Anyway, the plot is relatively simple. Jake Lawson, the brains behind 'Dutch Boy', an international system of satellites which control the world's climate, gets expelled from the program for insubordination and duly replaced with his own brother, Max.Even during these first few minutes, you see some very familiar cinematic clichés, with the rebellious rugged hero facing off against obstructive bureaucrats. This truly set the scene, for the movie appears to subsist almost entirely on clichés. Things predictably start going wrong, the rebellious rugged hero's expertise is suddenly required, the rugged hero reluctantly agrees to assist, a few rousing speeches are made, there is a political conspiracy and of course the hero survives with help. Surprisingly though the hero does not develop a romance with his female assistant (although his brother does). I suppose Devlin determined that he already had enough clichés to prop the film up for 90+ minutes. Luckily though, the clichés are presented in a way which makes the film quite watchable. Time didn't drag and the visuals are impressive enough to distract the undiscerning viewer from the film's faults, which are many. For example, the acting is utterly undistinguished. I suppose Gerard Butler isn't terrible, but any middle-aged man could have played his everyman character simply because he has little to do but appear alternately authoritative and sulky, maybe raising his voice a few times. Jim Sturgess was described by my friend as resembling a typical TV actor and I have to agree with such sentiment. You get the impression that his character (Max) is meant to inspire contempt for being a 'weasel' (Max's words) and usurping Jake's authority, but instead he arouses no emotion at all. Similar could be said for the likes of Ed Harris, Abbie Cornish and Andy Garcia. Similarly, the dialogue lacks distinction. The rousing speeches fail to leave an impression and there is little in the way of witty banter or genuine humour to lighten the rather intense mood. There are some stabs at characterisation as the complex relationship between Jake and Max is fleshed out and Ed Harris' character explains his motivations, but the characters are not made more memorable as a result. Even Max's romance with Cornish's character is not properly explained. Ultimately, my friend gave his opinion of this movie while we were driving home. ""Nice spectacle, bad acting, bad dialogue, all the usual disaster movie clichés"". I hate to admit it, but he was well and truly on the right track. Geostorm gets a pass from me for being watchable but nothing more.2.5/5 stars",Geostorm
189,cschultz-2,"Not A Bad Movie, Just A Silly One",6,22 October 2017,"""Geostorm"" is a big, splashy science fiction disaster picture, the likes of which we haven't seen sincewell, since the last big splashy Dean Devlin science fiction disaster picture. Devlin, who usually has worked in tandem with director and occasional partner Roland Emmerich, is the producer 1996's megahit ""Independence Day"" and its sequel, last year's ""Independence Day: Resurgence."" ""Geostorm"" is Devlin's first picture as a director.And if you didn't know Devlin was the director of ""Geostorm,"" you'd probably guess that he had something to do with it anyway, because the movie closely resembles the style of his previous movies.In ""Geostorm,"" decades of pollution and global warming cause the world's weather to go kerflooey. A scientist played by Gerard Butler devises a network of global satellites, which form a sort of electronic net around the world to regulate and control the weather. But somehow a gasket blows in the satellite weather system, and parts of the world develop a bad case of opposite weather—a deep freeze in Saudi Arabia, tornadoes in India, and a tsunami in Dubai, as if Mother Nature is trying to teach us a lesson in irony.So the scientist boards a shuttle to the International Space Station in order to figure out the problem with the system and fix it. And he soon learns that the glitch is not an accident—somebody sabotaged the controls. And the person who vandalized the system is a top official in the US government.Gerard Butler plays the scientist in ""Geostorm"" with an appropriate blend of irreverence, bravado, and attitude. His performance is like all the characters played by Charlton Heston in all the disaster movies of the 1970s rolled into one.Also having fun in ""Geostorm"" are Ed Harris, chewing the scenery as the president's right hand man, and Andy Garcia, pretending he's doing some heavy lifting as the president. Garcia somehow manages to overact just by being present, and by all appearances nearly gives himself a hernia when he has actual lines to speak.""Geostorm"" is not a bad picture, just a silly one. Also co-written by Devlin, this is one movie which should've been released on Memorial Day or the Fourth of July—it might've played better with a drive-in theater wrapped around it.",Geostorm

192,fandomfatale,Very entertaining movie for disaster genre fans,10,26 October 2017,"I'm a big time disaster movie fan, so I have been looking forward to Geostorm ever since I saw the first trailer many months ago. Even as hyped as I was, I can definitely say that I was not disappointed. I saw this movie with a friend who also likes disaster movies and we both agreed that it was better than we thought it would be, especially given the reviews, and we both had a great time. You won't hear me saying that it was perfect - it had weaknesses for sure, particularly in the resolution - but nothing that I considered to be unforgivable or that hindered my enjoyment. (You just have to buy into them the way you buy into the premise - they're all ridiculous on some level but it's part of the territory.) I've seen many of these types of films that I would never watch again, but I can honestly say that I'll probably rewatch Geostorm several times in the coming years. People who gave this movie less than a five have clearly never seen some of the truly awful disaster films put out by SyFy channel. And I find it hard to believe that any fans of the genre came out of this movie feeling like it had been a waste of their time. My friend pointed out that this movie has a little something for everyone - a mysterious government conspiracy, a car chase, a whole adventure on the space station in addition to what was happening on the ground, and family drama which I thought was pretty well written even if these types of reconciliation stories are rather cliché in the genre. It probably had too much going on, but that meant it never got boring.I would hate to think that people who would actually love this movie like I did would be put off by bad reviews, which is why I felt like I had to write a good one. If people don't go and see these kinds of movies they're not going to make them anymore, especially disaster movies which require a big budget to look good. *Mrs. Lovejoy voice"": ""Won't somebody please think of the disaster movie fans?""TLDR: I could spend a lot of time talking about ways to critique this movie, even as a fan of it, but I think the most important thing I can say is that I enjoyed it quite a lot and would see it again.",Geostorm

194,jordanthomas_2009-346-914758,A disaster of a movie...,5,27 November 2017,"Geostorm opens with real life footage of previous natural disasters complete with a narration by a girl who sounds like a robot. It must feel like an insult to those victims being used for such a poorly conceived idea of a film involving weather controlling satellites (yes weather controlling satellites..) Originally set for a release of early 2016 the film suffered major production problems including a studio change and re-shoots. Cast and crew (even the film's extras) noted that star/producer Gerard Butler kept forgetting all his lines. But then again he's only in it for the money like everyone else. Anyway the plot/story is about a series of mysterious disasters/accidents occurring all of which are blatantly obvious assassinations. One character gets blown into space, a crane supposedly malfunctions nearly killing dozens and someone gets pushed in front of a moving car. But that's not all, people also get frozen. Anyway Its all down to the creator of this satellite (Gerard Butler) to investigate. Now the film thinks its smart and expects you to be surprised as these events unfold, but you'll see all the twists and turns a mile away. The fact that the person behind all of these 'accidents' isn't revealed till the third act makes it even more laughable. Its as if the film thought ""ah you didn't see that coming did ya"", it just treats its audience like morons. Apparently the screenwriter wrote it in three days, which sounds about right. Geostorms biggest problem is it execution, all the actors give half-assed performances and it is loud, stupid, filled with clichés and unintentional laugh-out-loud moments. Its a disaster movie, that becomes a disaster of a movie. Yes the dog survives, yes thousands of people die but as long as the dog survives everything is okay. Now giving it a 5 out of 10 rating may seem generous, but I give it the extra star because it is stupidly fun, dumb entertainment that takes its self too seriously and like me you'll probably enjoy it for all of the wrong reasons. However if you want a decent disaster flick i'd recommend watching Twister, Dantes Peak or The Day After Tomorrow instead as they are masterpieces compared to this.",Geostorm
195,duvernetphotography,Typical Hollywood,5,20 January 2018,"All the world's disasters begin and end with America. They all happen to America, about America and only America can save the world. The premise is that a network of satellites and a space station can have sufficient control over the Earth's weather to solve the extreme weather patterns that are developing. One man, Mr. Butler, designed the station at the heart of it all. Butler is playing a shoot-from-the-hip super scientist who designed the station. From all the characters Butler has played, this is the strangest. It doesn't fit his persona at all. Getting passed that is a challenge enough, but the dial a weather storm capability of the station is another implausible freak show. Getting passed that, the fact that one man could bring it all down, was another illogical possibility. Getting passed that...The special effects were outstanding and Talitha Bateman puts on the crying face better than I've ever seen a kid do. She's fantastic. Abbie Cornish looks so hot in those professional heels and she wields a gun as good as it gets. She plays the SS to save the day. Her partner in crime, to save the day, Jim Sturges is always looking hysterical, so over the top silly. Have fun watching for a light flick. Don't expect anything serious.

196,northernpaladin,Not quite a disaster,5,12 May 2021,"This is pretty sappy but then so are most disaster movies and this really isn't as bad as some would have you believe.Yes it has Gerard Butler posturing his way through in a cardboard cut out role but so does Willis in Armageddon. We don't have too many stupid witticisms in the face of death and the effects are pretty fair.In terms of plot, a super satellite which off sets extremes of weather being turned into the death star by a born again Republican and a greedy punk scientist was always going to be difficult and it is. Ed Harris plays his role with ease although the reveal and denouement is pretty badly done. Andy Garcia looks presidential enough but Cornish struggles with a badly conceived role and Sturgiss just looks goofy.The overall message of climate control and nations coming together to combat it is a welcome one and that theme survives for most of the film even when get into the dark forces acting against humanity for no sane reason territory. However the narrative seriously falls apart in the final 20 minutes when the satellite is firing lasers and inflicting every possible form of weather on the earth at will while Harris and his goons pursue Garcia & Cornish through a weather freak show in a cartoon car chase which has zero credibility. Particularly irritating was the Butler is a hero arc (is he ever anything else?) where the writers and director can't seem to make up their mind whether to go for dead hero saves mankind or ingenious hero cheats death, so we get a feel good oh did tens of thousands die while I was being clever end which is just insulting.I wouldn't rush to watch it but if you catch it on Prime like I did and it's a wet afternoon it passes the time.",Geostorm
197,jan-hranac,Cringefest,1,23 January 2018,"There's a lot of articles and reviews about what it means when you say ""sci-fi"" and what kind of liberties can films belonging to this genre take so I'm going to respect the reader's intelligence and skip all that.This movie was full of complete and utter nonsense. However, I'm not going to list them all here and instead, I'll talk about only one - the most cringe-worthy one. It's the satellite network featuring in the movie. To be more precise, it's the positions of vast majority of the satellites and height's of all of them.
When this network appeared on screen for first time, I've barely registered anything wrong with it because it wasn't apparent whether it was just a thin belt around the equator and whether it moves (or does not) relatively to the ground below. The second time, I noticed. It was clear that the network is at least 90 degrees wide. The third time, it became clear that it was covering the entire planet from pole to pole.Are you cringing already? If not, then perhaps it's too obvious (and too outrageous). So let me repeat: a triangular network of satellites (which are physically connected) covering the entire planet. Each satellite is relatively low and hangs above one spot at all times (and the satellites don't move relatively to each other either, of course). Are cringing now? You should be.Geostationary satellites can orbit only above the equator. Anything else will be geosynchronous at best (but they will still need to cross the equator twice per orbit). Moreover, geostationary satellites need to be at quite a big altitude - which would make them completely impractical for the intended purpose of controlling the weather. The most outrageous thing presented in the movie is an idea of a satellite hanging motionlessly above a pole - that means, not orbiting at all. A trick question: what happens to an object that has no velocity and is in presence of a source of gravity? Yes, it will fall right down.Perhaps the authors of this monstrosity would like to become directors of the Afghan space program, I've heard that they are hiring.",Geostorm

A dull and predictable movie that isn't even able to make the destruction of cities exciting, Geostorm proclaims itself a mystery at one point, but the only surprising thing about it was that it wasn't directed by Roland Emmerich.A group of moderately talented actors barely sticking around in Hollywood (Gerard Butler, Jim Sturgess, and Abbie Cornish) team up with more talented actors with minimal screen time (Andy Garcia and Ed Harris) to put as little effort into reading lines from a script that no one bothered to actually make any sense of. The jokes fall flat and the attempts at dramatic moments are the only source of comedy in the movie.

207,toddcha,could have been a great movie but not a really disaster movie,5,14 October 2017,"The theme of this movie is inventive, and original: men control the weather but fail to control the heart and ambition. Seems typical, I mean the ambition part, but the weather control part and 'weather as a weapon' is great. The opening is great which gives men a heads-up that in the near future human beings may encounter such extreme weather change. Though this is not uncommon to see in many movies, including Interstellar which also centers on the theme that the Earth is no longer a suitable habitat for human due to extreme weather.However, the movie focuses too much, I mean way too much, on the emotional touch and brotherhood conflict. Don't get me wrong. Sentiment or feelings are crucial to any films. Bus in Geostorm such conflicts have no EMOTIONS at all. The only good scene that presenting the brotherhood is the talk in front of Gerard Butler's porch. And that's how the whole movie goes down. Meanwhile the 'weather as weapon' scene is far from enough and diverse. For instance, the 5 (or six?) tornadoes in India (perhaps other middle east areas) just hovering around. In all, from 0:10 to 1:15, you can skip it. Nothing really important happened during this part.

Sometimes I see a trailer for what looks to be a bad movie, and I go to see that movie just so I can laugh. And wouldn't you know it, this movie really, really sucked. But if you know that going in, it's massively entertaining.To clarify: this movie is NOT propaganda for climate change, or any other nonsense like that. It's not an allegory for something that might happen in the future, it's not taking stabs at Republicans. If you somehow got that idea, please take a nice, long, hot shower. This will help you clear your head of any BS that might have slipped through your feed. This movie is just about the guy from 300 who made internet history saying ""THIS! IS! SPARTA!"" making a satellite that controls the weather, and then some dude hacks it to become the president. We'll get to how flawed that is later, but please don't think anything stupid like what was stated above. The movie has enough stupid without ideas like those.The whole movie is basically an excuse to show effects. This would be fine if the effects were good. But they're not. They're really not. Most of the movie just has really bad green-screen, or some CGI looking piece of garbage. The satellite itself looks like a cheap model ripped from The Martian, an infinitely better movie that I highly recommend. The giant, city destroying effects lack weight, and depth, and any realism whatsoever. There's two different shots of waves rolling over a beach with people running. One happens in Dubai, the other happens in Rio. But with Rio, the waves are actually icy cold. Shiver shiver. Snore. Mostly snore. Also people must have heard about what was going on in Tokyo and Hong Kong right? So why is everyone just at the beach expecting nothing to go wrong?Some of the weather doesn't even make sense. Did anyone making the movie even understand the science behind the weather? Or did someone just throw money at the creators until the movie was finished? There's one scene with 4 giant tornadoes in India. And the tornadoes are really close to the area we're focusing on. And yet nothing is being blown into them. That's not how tornadoes work! Florida is under a lightning storm. Dubai is being flooded. Moscow just has a Death Ray going through the middle of it. WHAT? That's the kind of thing Megamind did! You know, that animated movie starring a bunch of cool people that was really funny and good and underrated? They straight up bring out the full, concentrated power of the sun! And it's so dumb!The villain's motives don't make any sense. I quote directly from the movie, ""Imagine what a scientist gets paid. Now imagine that times 500"". He's destroying the Earth to become the President of the United States. But why? You're gonna blow up the United States in the process! Oh and here's a funny thing; he starts off the destruction slowly. First he hits Hong Kong. It's suspicious, but eh. Then he hits Tokyo and Rio. It's not even subtle. The first one was chalked off as a malfunction, but this time it's obvious that it was intentional. And then, the dude behind it all just says ""F*ck it! Goodbye Earth!"" and hits every major city in the world.Oh, and here's the fun part. The part that made me burst out laughing and left me in hysterics long after the movie was over. Right after the people on the satellite stop the destruction in Rio, A SELF DESTRUCT SEQUENCE INITIATES! What????? Who puts a self destruct sequence in a satellite? More importantly why did you make it so easy to access! That's the kind of thing Dr. Doofenshmirtz does! There's not any kind of government code to stop it. Butler says ""oh, I put that in in case it fell down to Earth I could blow it up"". But that makes even less sense! Put in some backup thrusts, or give the authorization codes to the government, or SOMETHING! ANYTHING!I haven't even talked about the characters, how dumb the name Geostorm is, that one Chinese dude who gets pushed into traffic, the poor action, or the President saying ""YOU KNOW HOW I DID IT? BECAUSE I'M THE GODDAMN PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES"". But I think I've said enough. I feel really sorry for the poor souls who bought tickets to this thing unironically, as this movie is nothing more than a 120 million buck scam.

The clock stops with just 3 seconds left on it - no way????
Despite there being no escape there is an escape - Wow???
Everything is televised live around the world including the space station blowing up???
What his girlfriend is a secret service agent protecting the president - what a coincidence!!!
What the techie wants to meet and tell all at a cafe and is killed on route???
The two brothers don't get along but it all fixes itself in the end???Basically this movies is a moderately high budget pile of dung. It literally scrapes all of the cliches together into one hideous plot in which a network of satellites that looks like someone has built a shell around the earth control the weather - oh and they did this in just a few years - hey we can't even lay a railway line between London and Glasgow that fast. But, despite all of this, a virus allows the baddies to take over the whole project and turn it into a weapon. And then it just gets worse, presidential kidnappings, stadiums blowing up, iconic locations freezing or burning. Heck i was waiting for Tower Bridge to get knocked down again. Yes this movies pulls together all the cheesy bits from other disasters movies and then executes them really badly. It entertainingly sucks. It's entertainingly bad. It pulls tired A list actors firmly into a B list movie with an A list budget. Watch it be set your expectations to low.",Geostorm
215,cary_howe,SciFi Channel movie with a lot of money,6,26 January 2019,"I didn;t know the history on this film when I started watching it. It got obvious early on they had more money than your regular SciFi Channel movie but oddly enough the script, acting and directing were all on par with most SciFi Channel movies. Very slick effects, very mediocre story and acting. Take away the 100 mill in effects and you have a 3 mill SciFi Channel movie. The locations and sets are nicer but if you closed your eyes you couldn;t tell this one from a hundred other films like this they crank out because they know SciFi Channel will pay back half or more of their budget so they know going in they'll make a profit. This one it sounds like it largely broke even but for a 3 mill film that cost 120 mill to make I;d say they dodged a bullet. It's vaguely entertaining but does have nice effects. If you are after a good movie this isn;t it but if you;re trying to kill 90 minutes I;ve seen worse. Sadly these days for me this passes for a good review. I often start watching movies on streaming services and I'll go through a dozen or more getting as little as two minutes into films before I can find one that holds my attention enough to even finish it. I'm not saying find a good one just find a film I can make it to the end.

I absolutely loathe Andy Garcia. And the rest of the clowns in this circus were absolutely forgettable. Where to even begin? After you've seen enough of these disaster/catastrophe movies, you realize they're all the same. Just repackaged with different faces and different sequences of the same dialogue. You also realize that when a movie starts out showing how mankind let Earth turn into a toilet by showing random real life footage of natural disasters, that you're in for a real dog of a movie. I could sit here and write paragraphs of the stupidity of this movie, but I'll keep it to a few observations. The space station is enormous. Like, it is so big that its got like 10 ft ceilings with plenty of overhead wasted space, because as everyone knows constructing opulent, roomy and capacious space stations is realistic. Here's another thing - the wisecracking, defiant British millennial douchebag who meets Butler and within one nanosecond decides to be a wisecracking dickhead. Come on. Next - the ""diversity"" of the ""international team"". Yep. Another thing - ever notice how when a movie requires the President to be moral, strong, unwavering, uncorrupted, they make sure to cast the President as either black or a female? Or a black female? But when they need him to be a dumbass, or nefarious they make sure he's white and is surrounded by white advisers. Why is that? Oh, and I had to laugh at Butler's brilliant solution to use the new satellites as projectiles to knock out the corrupted ones. But they only did that once. What the F? And speaking of the new satellites - they somehow have a manufacturing plant ON THE SPACE STATION making these things??? Seriously??? Oh brother. I couldn't make it to the end. I made it as far as Sturgess and his blonde bimbo Secret Service girlfriend kidnapping the President. I then said ""f*ck this sh_t"" and threw a brick through by big screen tv.

I'm thinking never, it's just that everyone else so extremely bad that Gerard actually comes off as ok. The special effects are a joke in this movie, it just looks cheap and totally fake most of the times. Movies as Deep Impact, The Day After Tomorrow and Armageddon have better special effects and those movies are 20 years old.. About the storyline.. I don't even know where to begin but in general so many things happen that make you think, really? It's just so far fetched at times and overall just a highly unlikely turn of events and relations.

Apparently it's only a few years into the future and yet a coalition of countries has managed to encircle the entire earth with an array of incredibly advanced weather-altering satellites and the ISS is now a massive space station (lol wut). They could just have easily set this like 20/30 or even 50 years in the future to make it far more believable, but whatever. Lots of your typical Rolland-Emmerich favorites like running away from ice, buildings collapsing like dominoes, and beams of heat that make anything spontaneously combust. Also the main bad guy's plan is unbelievably stupid and convoluted. It's not a good movie by any means, but it's so dumb in how it ignores pretty much all laws of physics that it can be somewhat entertaining (people freezing instantly? Lol sure).

The plot was ridiculous, the script was written entirely in clichés, the acting from the main characters was woeful, proof positive that Gerard Butler can't act to save his life but then again he positively shone when paired with Jim Sturgess who was just terrible and appears to be an emotional cripple. The two female leads, Abbie Cornish and Alexandra Maria Lara, were the saving graces in the acting stakes. I could throw in some spoilers but the wounds are just too fresh to go there at the moment. Hollywood has gotten so disrespectful of their audience these days that they appear happy to throw up anything these days without any attention to quality control. It has been suggested that if you put enough monkeys in front of enough keyboards they will eventually tap out the complete works of Shakespeare.

232,kashidomar,when climate matters the most......,9,12 October 2017,"Very few science fiction movies are concerned about the climate change of earth..here is the one that reminds us that our climate is constantly changing..climate , environment these are synonymous to nature. Natural ways of god has rotated it all the way upto this time. They have their own controlling centre. They are uncertain and also unpredictable. Although many ways have been created and trialled by human but they are not fully capable of controlling these natural process. This movie is also related with this unsuccessful attempt of human to control climate. The plot centers around a satellite which man has discovered to control climate and geological processes. This type of sci-fi thoughts are exceptional and oblivious.The first thing that has attracted my mind towards this film is this satellite controlling idea of the film. It is quite discrete and different idea. But soon the idea backfires as it attacked the earth. But behind this there is a buried mystery and conspiracy that when revealed is very much thrilling. This is not only just an ordinary sci-fi movie, this is also a thriller movie with lot of suspense and drama all around the characters.This will make you guessing the climax and you will eagerly wait for it.And not forget about the graphics and cinematography of this film. The overview of the satellite, the climate changes and the effects,the earthquakes shattering the roads,the volcanic evolution of earth and last of all the geostorm- all this special effects are very very good and jerky. Specially in the geostorm those big ice pieces raining and hitting the structures,aeroplanes,cars and buildings, the large tidal wave which is also in the poster of the movie just splashing everything around its course..these scenes are very much praiseworthy.Good to see Gerard Butler returning in a good form and with a good movie..This type of movie really suits him. He has done incredibly well in the character. His acting and actions are well here.He is an additive force in the running flow of the movie.He is been in the central role in the defence action against the satellite. Other co actors have also done well to make it a notable work.Director Dean Devlin has also done a fine work. He has written a good script with very creative and imaginary thoughts and has drawn it in the shooting superbly. He has rotated the special effects , the characters , the machines and the dialogues all around in a co- ordinated way that it has been an excellent mixture of thriller and sci-fi thoughts.Movies like this which has touched many sphere of qualities and quantities of a film is absent now a days.Specially movies related with climate and environment doesn't count much.

239,darryl-42069,Enjoyable disaster movie that went way over-the-top (and it's a good thing),7,14 October 2017,"Written and Directed by Dean Devlin in his directorial debut, I personally question his ability to direct a movie, especially when it's about a space engineer trying to fix a weather-controlling satellite before a massive disaster, the Geostorm, ensues. With a pretty big budget for a newbie director, and a great cast, including the well-known guys like Gerald Butler, Ed Harris and Andy Garcia, there a 50-50 chance that it'll succeed, ...or fail. Ultimately, Geostorm is a solid enough movie, with good directing, great music, good acting, and possibly one of the craziest disaster movies out there.Gerald Butler is great as the troubled Jake. The crew of the ISS is also great, particularly Alexandra Maria Lara as Commander Ute, Eugenio Derbez as Hernandez, and Amr Waked (who I at first thought it's Antonio Banderas) as Dussette. Ed Harris is amazing as Leonard Dekkom, and Andy Garcia is also very good as President Palma. Jim Sturgess as Max, however is wooden at times, so does Abbie Cornish as Secret Service agent Sarah Wilson, although she did got some badass moments which is great.The movie pushed the boundaries of believability, and presents us with probably one of the most craziest, over-the-top doomsday scenario ever put on film. Frozen on the Afghanistan desert, extreme heat on Hong Kong, and massive tsunami in Dubai is just one of the examples of how over-the-top, but still enjoyable film. It's a solid mark on Devlin's directorial work, and we can expect to see him directing again soon. The story's focus about climate change actually helps in adding tension and kept us imagining what happened if these disasters happened in real life. The humor is also well executed, and worked, especially those who seems to came straight outta a meme(""Marry Her!"" - the president). The editing is also, very well done. Intense scenes felt very intense. Action scenes felt very exciting, and emotional scenes felt very impactful. They also tried at concealing the plot twist in the movie, and they did very well. The cinematography is good, and the music is also, very good, another remarkable work by Lorne Balfe. What does surprise me is it's political subplot, which actually, a great idea (but leads to one of my gripes with this movie).However, this movie is plagued by a lot of problems. The dialogue is cheesy at times and some scenes felt very awkward. The movie is also filled with plenty of plot holes. Several plot points were mentioned and gone without resolution, and small problems appear, and then completed within like 5 minutes of screen time. The CGI is at times very unconvincing, with destruction physics felt very fake. And as aforementioned, the political subplot is a great idea on paper, but it suffers from Devlin's direction, which makes the subplot seems unnecessary and very out of place.Nevertheless, Geostorm is insanity at it's finest. The over-the-top plot, along with great cast, good performance and an all-out spectacle of destruction makes it a enjoyable ride from start to finish, though the dialogue and unconvincing CGI ruins the movie a bit.Final Score: 7/10",Geostorm

I can totally relate. We came to see destruction, that kid and I! To see a disaster film! But, frankly, the only disaster here is the script. First of all, the whole first 45 minutes could have been skipped. Frankly, no one cares about Gerald Butler and his relationship with his brother. (That whole plot line plays out like a lack- luster tele-novela.) And Jim Sturgess is so bad, the less we see of him actually talking the better.

Zazie Beetz having an affair with Secret Service agent Abbie Cornish... Now that would have been interesting...)This is how they SHOULD have done it: Start the movie with the Geostorm clock.

Meanwhile, Zazie and Abbie are racing around with the president shooting bad guys!65% of the planet is destroyed! (For real! Even the dog!)

There is no whooshing, clunking or explosion sounds in the space scenes BECAUSE IT IS A VACUUM. There are some actual futuristic cars to go with all of the space shuttles and the fancy smart phones.

The storms were nicely done. CGI was convincing. Why I think this works better than other ""Natural Disaster"" films is because they did not revolve the plot around the storms...the storms were just the vehicle of destruction used.

The characters are stock and stupid, and basically its like every disaster movie you've scene. The idea on paper sounds cool but nothing cool is done with it. If we don't care about any characters in random cities, why should we be invested in the destruction?

The plots are predictable and therefor never exciting. This is also due to the main characters, two brothers who are getting in each others way early in the movie, who never convince as portraying real persons. Partly because of bad and overacting and possibly because of the weak story lines.The story is about a corrupted climate control system in space surrounding our atmosphere. The effects of the corruption (extreme cold, hailstorms and the like) are shown quite sensational. The unfolding of the corruption, like the sequence how the weather control structure is destructed, is far-fetched and unbelievable. In the cinema I saw the movie the public sometimes laughed because of the lack of credibility.If you want to see nice out of space pictures you will not be disappointed.

He tried to create a good science fiction but ended up creating something that reminded me of the second part of Independence Day (which was an awful science fiction). Another thing that ruined this movie was the poorly written script, which was also written by this incompetent director.However there are a few things that make this movie not that bad. They tried to get rid of the ""The USA saves the world"" cliché (they failed, but hey - at least they tried). The idea behind the movie was good and original. But as I already said the director and the bad acting of the actors (which is also the director's fault) ruined it.This movie had the potential of becoming a great science fiction, such as Interstellar and The Martian but only if it was directed by a more talented person. Still I give this movie 6 out of 10, simply because the idea was original and managed to unite fiction and catastrophe into one. Too bad they failed to find a decent director, who will be able to make this idea into a masterpiece.",Geostorm

In facing adversity, mankind developed a satellite station to prevent these catastrophes. While people overcame this problem, another conflict arises when it becomes opportune to use the technology as a weapon for sole global domination.The setting in which the story takes place, you can say, parallels our own at the present in which we are experiencing technological advancements which perks we use to solve our crises but also create further dilemma as countries individually vie to be the world superpower. Going to see the movie, I wasn't expecting much for it because it seemed like a so-so movie that's probably been done before only re- released with a ""semi different plot"" under a different title. But I was surprised by how entertaining it is. There's the timeliness of its subject, there's definitely humor (which is funny but I thought they somehow overdid with some of the dialogue) but this one has also dramatic scenes that would touch you. The pathos really got me emotionally involved with what the characters are experiencing. This aspect I really enjoyed. The downside, I can still say that it seems a lot of it's contents were borrowed from/ inspired by previous natural disaster/sci-fi flicks such as Day After Tomorrow ( look at one of its posters for instance), Armageddon, and Gravity to name a few. This might be a turnoff for moviegoers who are expecting originality and it will most likely be so but for me, I got over it and had myself a good time in the cinema.

In one scene we see some kind of extreme ice storm suddenly descending on Rio, with everything frozen instantly in its path. Except for a bikini clad beachgoer who somehow manages to outrun it! I couldn't even muster a laugh because at that stage I was beginning to nod off and looking at my watch every couple minutes just hoping it was going to end soon. It actually makes other Hollywood disaster flicks like 2012 and San Andreas seem pretty interesting and entertaining. On the plus side, the special effects were excellent I thought so kudos to the CGI firms & artists. The scenes of Dubai flooding and Hong Kong burning were highlights. CGI though should only ever play a supporting role to good acting and plot and this stinker had hardly any of the latter two. It is possible to make good disaster films.

Not 10 of course. I gave it a 10, but it's just because I only rate my movies either 10 or 1. Like or Dislike. People's taste changes over the years so specific ratings is not really credible.Now, first of all, Geostorm is not really a ""Disaster"" movie
2012 and The Day After Tomorrow are pure disaster movies since the protagonists are ""living through the disaster"". Geostorm is not this kind.
Remember The Core and Sunshine? Geostorm is more like those, the background story is global disaster, but the movie itself focuses on the adventure thriller of the world saving heroes.Geostorm was marketed as disaster movie, with trailers focusing on the disasters, but most of the movie is about unraveling the mysteries of the incidents. There weren't even protagonists put as a civillians to truly experience the might of the disasters. The disasters were just... Side stories, backdrop.So, the conclusion, this rating is for Geostorm as disaster movie. As a different kind of movie altogether, this deserves higher rating.Btw, Sarah was badass!",Geostorm

Plot/story line 2. Acting/chemistry 3. Cinematography, and 4. message/point ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^1. Story line: First half of movie seems like it was written by high school drama team trying for their final class project. If it was high school drama team then it's really good. Second half is like their parents picked up(because the drama students went to Denver on a skiing trip?)because the plot takes cool twists making the end make you say. Wow, not too awful. 2. Acting: It had Gerard Butler, enough said. But, even Gerard couldn't carry the bad writing. Relationship with daughter was exactly like the forced, cliché movie ""Interstellar"" with worse writing. No chemistry with any characters. 3. Cinematography, Great, Hollywood has really figured out how to do realistic gravity (or lack of) filming is the best supporting actor here. C.g.i. is a winner here. 4. Message, amazed Hollywood didn't cast a Trump looking political figure as the final nemesis. It used a Democrat to defend the world against climate change.

And then the first scene reached its end and fear took hold of me.That was pretty poorly written. But then I saw other seasoned actors. Beautiful and talented Abbie Cornish, then Harris and Garcia, this thing just had to improve again.
It didn't.
It's been a while since I've seen such flat stereotyped one-dimensional characters with zero evolution throughout the movie. It's been a while (20 years or so) since I've seen such obvious fake fights. It has not been a while since I stopped rooting for seemingly good guys to bite it but this time, it really should have happened.
No excuse guys. I could have easily written better dialogues myself. I could have easily presented better and more believable scenes that would cost less special effects. I probably could have acted better and be more credible as a scientist/engineer/ special agent/...

It was appropriate for the intro and exit to be voiced by a child in view of the absurd, childish, fact-free, delusions of godhood, enviro-wacko basis for the nonsense too ridiculous to describe. One reviewer laughably groundlessly condemned America being the savior in the film in view of her allegedly deficient environmental bona fides, the usual silly hypocritical, virtue-signaling accusation in the fact-free fantasy of mindless green hate-America bigotry that gives a pass to real polluters like China while condemning America's proven superiority in environmental responsibility. It's the proven incompetence of greens that promotes various insufficient ""renewable"" power like solar and wind power while conveniently ignoring its proven pollution contaminating the environment, any lie or omission to promote the power mad agenda.",Geostorm

In a way I did get this but there was a whole other story happening as well. We had Jake Lawson, the creator of satellite networks Dutch Boy, being sent back out to space to investigate and fix whatever glitch was causing Dutch Boy to create natural disasters one after another three years after he's fired by his younger brother. This created some tension throughout the movie as it's one of those things Jake always resented since Dutch Boy was his life at the time. As it turns out this glitch isn't actually a glitch but someone using Dutch Boy for their own means. In terms of characters, nobody really caught my attention. Jake was kind of funny but also a pain, Max (his bro) was annoying all the time to me (but their relationship did feel like that of estranged brothers), and everyone else only had little screen time. The only character who I really liked was Sarah, but again, she was more of a side character (but she was badass, please marry me). My favorite part was when Eugenio Derbez says ""thank the Mexican"", I cracked up like yes!It's not a bad movie but there's also nothing about it that makes it stand apart from other movies.

Many fans of the genre might have been waiting for one to come out and this film will make them proud. However during the majority of the movie many parts and scenes were just over the top. With lots of heavy CGI effects it made the film unrealistic. With CGI playing a major role the film-makers could've lowered some of that effect to make this film even better. Not a bad disaster movie but not a great one.,Geostorm

It's a ludicrous premise underlined by poor script, poor story line, and wooden acting. Gerard Butler plays...Gerald Butler in a familiar screen presence. The supporting cast are allowed no development as the disaster unfolds (they start out as annoying and maintain that momentum throughout the movie). The movie is a poor pastiche of earlier world extinction genres. The CGI is ok, but again we've seen it before particularly in 'Gravity' and reminds us of the expression : less is more.
In the hands of a different director, this movie could have been better as the theme does have some potential. As it is, we are left with a so-so movie.

The film ""2012"" was much more deep - or maybe ""Geo"" was a bit lazy.I didn't like the final parts, as it seemed like the production team ran out of time and needed to speed things up.

I didn't expect much from this movie. I wanted to be entertained, and I didn't want to have to think too much. Geostorm was entertaining enough for me to watch it until 5 minutes before the end. I had to end it when they're sitting on the dock fishing and the corny lines and family bonding was ultimate cringe matertial - I couldn't take it. I'd sat through the whole movie trying to dodge cringe bullets. Damn, I couldn't take it another second.Um, so I don;t know much about the movie business. When I read that $120 million dollars was spend on this production I thought of all the wasted talent and the wasted good money like this can do for people's lives.There's no wit, no class, very little skill. It's like everyone was doing the bare minimum thing. I didn't think the CGI was very good either. I watch a lot of films - some of them are magical - and that can make the less magical movies look like garbage, and it sucks to say that because I bet some people on this production may have done their best.I don't care about the science and logic in the plot - it can be a completely unbelievable idea, as long as it is convincing enough. I thought, ""sure, nets over the globe controlling the global warming crisis - I can get on board"". But the acting was cringe worthy (except the blonde agent chick. she's a push over to her fiance in the film, but I like the actress) and unrealistic.I suppose I was entertained enough to give it 4 stars, out of 10 though. It's like Geostorm tried every trick in the film industry book to blow Hollywood away. I think it just blew away $120 mil and some of the audience. Maybe it made a profit ... hope so for them.Cheers.",Geostorm
312,LumosX,Roland Emmerich would be proud!,6,8 January 2018,"... and he probably is, as we'll discuss a bit later.Now, I've got a very soft spot for ""The Day After Tomorrow"". It's one of my all-time favourite films, a ""guilty pleasure"", if you wish. I also enjoy watching bad katastrophenfilms, of the likes made by the Asylum, or those starring Stephen Baldwin (like ""Dark Storm"" or ""Earthstorm"", both released in 2006 to make it even worse), or all the other Canadian ones.In comparison to those, I feel like this one is being bashed way too hard. Then again, I went in knowing exactly what I was expecting, and I've found that my expectations going in are rather important when the time comes for final ratings.This one wasn't bad, and was very Emmerich-y. Let's go through the list, shall we:
Well-known actors, some maybe wishing they were somewhere else, tick;Badass dad with family issues, tick;Badass dad has a super-intelligent child, tick;SPACE! Tick;Cataclysms on earth, tick;Love story, tick, albeit this one is rather subdued;Convoluted technological thingamajig McGuffin, tick;Bombs Solve All Possible Problems; tick;The president of the US; tick;Conspiracies, tick;Men with guns shooting their guns, tick;Previously unseen civilians at the disaster's ground zero who die, tick;Other similarly unseen civilians at ground zero who live, tick.""The Day After Tomorrow"" plus ""Independence Day"" ought to give us an approximation of what we see there. If I were Roland Emmerich, and I was watching this, I'd shed one single tear from my eye. That's how proud I'd be that someone else has made a movie like one of those that I'm well-known for.Aside from the list of tropes, we get two UK lads pretending to be American, some nice CGI, ridiculously large interiors on the ISS, and collapsible touchscreen phones and tablets (lifted right out of ""The Expanse""). Oh, and some other shenanigans, too.In the end though, this film is about family, and it subverts expectations... oh, wait, wrong website to post this on. My bad.I give this a solid 6/10. I was entertained, and it's better than mediocre. Then again, when it comes to disaster movies, I consider ""Earthstorm"" with Stephen Baldwin to be mediocre. It's worth one single watch, not any more, but it's not the piece of stinking rubbish that other commenters seem to believe it is.

340,fredlondi,Better than your average disaster flick,8,30 October 2017,"I'm a huge disaster film buff. Watched more of them than I can count from 1960's ""The Last Voyage"" to 2006's ""Snakes On A Plane."" In this genre, my least favorite films have always been the ones involving space: ""Armageddon,"" ""Deep Impact,"" and 1979's ""Meteor"" all sit toward the bottom of my list. When I heard about ""Geostorm,"" I wasn't at all confident it would rise any higher than those.Fortunately, I was wrong.Similar to ""Independence Day: Resurgence,"" ""Geostorm"" attempts to portray a not-too-distant future with massive developments in technology, blending both present-day reality and sci-fi imagination. In this respect, ""Geostorm"" does a much better job, simply because there's no franchise guiding it. This is but one of many surprises.The film is also aware that it has to cover a lot of ground while making sure it's understandable. Too many films overlook this and become an incomprehensible mess. Here, right from the start, you're given exactly how much you need to know, and information is doled out gradually from there. A big accomplishment when you're trying to tell the story of a global catastrophe wrought by a series of weather satellites.I was also intrigued by the casting, with two brothers played by the rough-and-tumble Gerard Butler of ""300"" fame with Jim Sturgess, who I'd only identified with romances like ""Across The Universe"" and ""Upside Down."" It was a really interesting choice, and I liked watching the two of them play off each other with such different personalities. They were the heart of this story, and I liked the scenes they were in.Disaster films are, by nature, imperfect movies, and this is no exception. Ironically, the biggest names in the cast, Andy Garcia as the President and Ed Harris as the Secretary of State, seem the most awkward in this movie. This is most noticeable late in the movie when the two share dialogue. But both are also part of one of the film's most intriguing subplots, where the disasters occurring are actually part of a much bigger mystery, one which ends up involving the entire cast. This was an aspect of the film I hadn't anticipated, and ended up greatly enjoying. This was a massive improvement over ""2012,"" which for some reason tried to make disaster funny, but its characters serious, and ""The Core,"" which revolved entirely around a dozen unlikable scientists. It was much closer to ""San Andreas,"" another favorite of mine among recent disaster flicks, where the characters felt like real people you wanted to see survive and thrive. I liked pretty much everyone in this film.One of the biggest things I appreciated about ""Geostorm"" was the music. I can't remember the last time I saw a film and was still humming the main theme afterward, or was so eager to find it after seeing it. I'd never heard of composer Lorne Balfe before, but was impressed by his sweeping, emotional score. It really gave the film more depth than I expected. Look up the track ""Family"" from the OST for a good example.Overall, a really surprising film. Not a perfect film, mind you, but not some crash-bang Michael Bay explosion-fest either. There's action, absolutely, but it's presented with a lot more class, emotion, and consequence.",Geostorm

Supporting actors pull off great performances too to keep the audience invested in the film. I was more interested in the special effects and the near future slightly dystopian society. If you enjoyed watching large-scale, disaster films of the late 90s and early 00s, in the vein of Independence Day, The Core, Dante's Peak, or Day After Tomorrow, this hits all the right points and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end. What I like about these kinds of films is that it doesn't try to reach too far with what it's trying to accomplish, keeps it simple with the added ""Wow"" factor of the CGI.",Geostorm

But ""Geostorm"" gives us moments like that. Remember in ""Airplane"" when we heard propeller airplane sounds for the jet? It was a gag, but we get something equally silly in this film. You also get the idea that every object in the movie is wired with 4kg to 400kg of C4. Flipped cars can certainly catch fire, but does every car have to go up like Vesuvius?In short, $millions tossed at the CGI and acting talent, $hundreds thrown at a script.

They start going bad and doing stuff like freezing an Afgan village, or cooking part of a city like a microwave. Two brothers try and find out what is going on a fix it. One goes to orbit the other stays on earth. It had two threads and many characters and used them well. It's a spy thriller with a large dose of a natural disaster movie thrown in.

362,neilbowers73,2 hrs of my life I won't be getting back,2,17 May 2018,"Where do I start with this other than describe it as utter bilge. Earth has seen natural disasters increase and more deaths as a result. Madrid has been wiped off the map due to a drought and New York as the result of the oceans rising. So what can be done I here you ask? Well step forward Gerrard Butler (Jake) the inventor of a satellite system created with the help of 17 countries call 'Dutch Boy' named after the little boy who plugged the dam with his finger. This has now eradicated all types of weather. Jake is called forward for a Senate meeting and has narked off the Senate because he is an hour late. That's because I've literally come down from outer space he growls. To cut a long story short despite his brother texting in the meeting to stop antagonising the Senate he loses his job, sacked by his own brother Max.Fast forward 3 years and something is up with the satellite system. A village in Afghanistan has been deep frozen and there is a massive explosion in Hong Kong which may or may not be related to the satellite issues. They also lose an Indian astronaut out through an airlock into space. So step forward Andy Garcia who is POTUS who is reluctant to hand over the ISS and the satellite where everyone works to an international group in 2 weeks time. He authorises Jake to go and get Max as he is the only one who can sort this mess out.Jake is now living in Florida over looking Cape Canavral with his daughter. Up steps Max who asks him to go back into space to sort out Dutch Boy, and up he goes to the ISS. Meanwhile down on Earth the Hong Kong operator discovers what shenanigans is going on, but is being followed by some shady characters and arranges to meet up with Max in DC. While Max is waiting, up on the ISS Jake discovers that something isn't quite right and almost loses his life while trying to retrieve a file. Back down on Earth Max's friend arrives but is shoved in front of a car by a shady character of who we don't they are. Unfortunately he dies while whispering something inaudible.Jake has done further investigation and sent his brother a coded message to basically trust no one. Max has also discovered what is actually happening the government is weaponising Dutch Boy and the only person who has the kill codes is the POTUS. These will need to be stolen as he won't give them up lightly or believe the reason. Low and behold due to an installed virus which can only be cleared by shutting the ISS down or the kill codes the satellites go into meltdown. Tokyo is flattened by giant hailstones and Rio Is frozen solid by a cold front. Birds drop out of the sky as does a Boeing 747 which miraculously misses a woman running through the streets of Rio. Now all hell is happening satellites are on the verge of creating one massive geostorm.Max thinks he's worked out that the POTUS was in on this and heads to where the president is currently giving a pre-election speech. He bumps into Ed Harris and explains what is going on. Meanwhile Moscow is fried and Washington is in the middle of an electric storm which flattens the city. Max soon discovers that Ed Harris is the bad guy (as always) and gets his CIA girlfriend to cause a scene as to distract the President so they can cause treason and hijack him. Oh and Jake discovers that an Australian scientist on the station was the person who installed the virus. He is swiftly dealt with by being sucked into space, as you do.The ISS is now in meltdown as well with Jake still on board. All of the other astronauts have thankfully escaped phew! Mumbai is having huge tornadoes, Dubai is now under water thanks to a huge tsunami that has wiped it of the map. Ed Harris wants the USA to be the shining beacon that it was in 1945 and also the POTUS which was his sole reason for doing this. Up on the crumbling ISS Jake gets ready to receive the kill codes and discovers he's not alone after all. The ISS commander has hidden herself away. They receive the codes and shut down and huzzah it reboots but not before the ISS blows into pieces have they both survived? Of course they have but they've hidden themselves into a pod. Which the last returning shuttle manages to catch. Thank the Mexican one astronaut says a bold political statement against the current POTUS and they all return as heroes and Jake makes up with his brother the end... Maybe I'm looking into this too much but do they seriously believe that a shuttle will be taking off every 10 minutes and landing every few minutes as well? We can't get beyond the moon and have no shuttles either. The size of the ISS the cost of building it would have crippled the worlds economy. Getting 2 Nations to work together is hard enough let alone 17. Ed Harris always plays the bad guy of late and Gerard Butler just growls his way through the film as per normal. The film had more wood in it from the acting than I've got in my wood shed. The CIA girlfriend of Max was a crack shot and could somehow drive her car one handed and shoot several times the driver of the car coming towards her. That car shot two bullets that would have killed Max outright as it hit the passenger side yet somehow they missed him. Just so many things wrong with this I could write them down but i'd be here all night. I'm glad I didn't see this at the cinema I'd have felt cheated.

And that movie of course is awful in its own right, but I would at east say it delivered on that front. Unlike this movie, which is almost two hours long and and you get two or three scenes where you really see some major destruciton happening and even then it is very disappointing for such an recent film that should have all the effects budget in the world.
But even if we look at the characters, there is just nothing there. Gerard Butler as the this genius scientist is just laughable, his brother as a somewhat high ranking gouvernment official even more so and who else even is there? The daughter just serves as some sort of plot device and has no character apart from aparently also being a genius, which doesn't come into play at all in the movie, wo why even bring it up? The crew Butlers character works with later on are a total waste as well and are just a bunch of clichees (and don't even know who is apparently, even though he build the whole operation which is a mssive thing? What movie?)
I sort of like the brothers secret service fiancee, but even then she really isn't great or can save the movie in any way.
The ending of course is some sort of sappy happy ending, but of course that is what you want for such a movie I guess, but in this it just doesn't feel earned and you are just glad it's over.
But again, the main failing of this movie is the lacking action. This movie clearly wanted to be 2012 as I already mentioned and it just isn't there.

Ultimately, Geostorm is a solid enough movie, with good directing, great music, good acting, and possibly one of the craziest disaster movies out there.Gerald Butler is great as the troubled Jake. The crew of the ISS is also great, particularly Alexandra Maria Lara as Commander Ute, Eugenio Derbez as Hernandez, and Amr Waked (who I at first thought it's Antonio Banderas) as Dussette. Ed Harris is amazing as Leonard Dekkom, and Andy Garcia is also very good as President Palma. Jim Sturgess as Max, however is wooden at times, so does Abbie Cornish as Secret Service agent Sarah Wilson, although she did got some bad ass moments which is great.The movie pushed the boundaries of believability, and presents us with probably one of the most craziest, over-the-top doomsday scenario ever put on film. Frozen on the Afghanistan desert, extreme heat on Hong Kong, and massive tsunami in Dubai is just one of the examples of how over-the-top, but still enjoyable film. It's a solid mark on Devlin's directorial work, and we can expect to see him directing again soon. The story's focus about climate change actually helps in adding tension and kept us imagining what happened if these disasters happened in real life. The humor is also well executed, and worked, especially those who seems to came straight outta a meme(""Marry Her!"" - the president). The editing is also, very well done. Intense scenes felt very intense. Action scenes felt very exciting, and emotional scenes felt very impactful. They also tried at concealing the plot twist in the movie, and they did very well. The cinematography is good, and the music is also, very good, another remarkable work by Lorne Balfe. What does surprise me is it's political subplot, which actually, a great idea (but leads to one of my gripes with this movie).Geostorm is insanity at it's finest.

382,contact-951-691937,Disappointing!,1,15 February 2018,"I wish I had read Mauro Volvox's review before wasting 1 hr 49 min of my life going to see this film. Everything about this movie was disappointing!Andy Garcia has always been one of my favorite actors, his role in this film is weak and unbelievable - what US President would react in the manner that his character is scripted to do? Ed Harris, another giant in film, is cast in a role I am certain he would have developed more deeply if allowed, but writer/director Devlin obviously had other plans. I'm honestly shocked that Ed accepted such a role, things must be tough for older actors in Hollywood these days.The emotion between Gerard Butler and Jim Sturgess' characters leaves a lot to be desired - it's not realistic, and is lacking true human emotion. Plus the backstory is missing too much for the viewer to understand the family dynamics. Adding another 15 minutes to the story might have given their characters depth, but again, Dean Devlin fails the audience.Geostorm is a disappointing failure in the Action Sci-Fi Thriller genre. If it had been billed as a satire based on some of the successful films with stories of the earth's threatened existence - pieces of which Devlin may have been trying to imitate (e.g., Independence Day (1996), The Day After Tomorrow (2004), etc.) then I might tend to be more charitable with this review, but unfortunately that is not the case.",Geostorm

How they ended up with Gerard Butler in the lead role baffles me, since the script isn't unique or written in a new and exciting way at all. I suppose he needed the money and some work. If you like this type of movie then go for it, but it doesn't bring anything new or relevant to the table at all, it's one of your dime a dozen natural disaster movies. Gerard Butler's Mary-Sue character goes out to save the world against the man made weather situation and there's a B-I-G cover-up going on.

The bad guy is a stereotype pur sang. The actors seem to have no idea what direction they want to go on and their well-tried efforts did not come out well from the editing room. It's so ridiculously edited, at one point they try to portrey 4 global disasters going one, while also telling a story down on Earth and one on the space ship.

411,dvd4040,"if you're a fan of these ridiculous films, then 'Geostorm' is for you, the same way 'Sharknado' would be.",6,8 February 2018,"Natural disaster films will always have a special place in my heart. Most of the time, they are over-the-top, ridiculous, and never make a lick of sense. Still, there is something entertaining in watching giant cities fall due to an alien invasion, a giant lizard, or is with the case of 'Geostorm', extreme weather. No matter what the premise, these films usually have the same intentions and plot structure, which usually involves one hero guy to save the day, millions of casualties, hilarious one-liners, and enough insane plot tangents that would cause you to have a headache.
If you're going into these types of movies, you'll have to go in with a certain expectation, or you will definitely not enjoy it. You have to suspend all belief in science, realism, and plausible actions. If you do this, you're gonna have a good time with what's on screen. 'Geostorm' is no different in this realm of movie genres. Behind the wheel on this vehicle is Dean Devlin, who is no stranger to natural disaster films. Devlin has written and or produced 'Independence Day', 1998's 'Godzilla', and 'Eight Legged Freaks' to name a few.'Geostorm' marks Devlin's directorial debut and he pulls no stops, but fails short of anything worth while, despite the over-the-top catastrophe that takes place. 'Geostorm' cost $120 million to make, but only made $33 million in theaters. It did far better overseas, which made back it's money and then some, but has yet to find a big audience to to the incoherence of it all. In the near future, there have been major weather events that have caused significant damages and killed a lot of people. The world has come together and developed a satellite system that prevents the storms from happening by firing missiles into the storm.
The brains behind this operation is Gerard Butler, which should tell you everything about this movie. For some reason, Gerard Butler is difficult to work with and is fired from this job where his younger brother Jim Sturgess replaces him. For the next few years, the satellite system works perfectly, until it doesn't and major cities fall and many people die by way of car sized hail, fire tornadoes, and even an ice storm in the desert that instantly freezes people to death. Turns out, there is a mystery person behind this who has injected a virus into the satellite system to cause these problems. It's now only up to Gerard Butler to travel to space and even kidnap the president of the United States, played by Andy Garcia to fix this problem. Mix in some henchmen, far-fetched theories, and Ed Harris, and you have a natural disaster picture that is highly entertaining and equally hilarious.None of it makes sense at all. You'd think that Dean Devlin would have known through years of experience to make solid and well-rounded characters or even frame a bit of action well, but that's not the case. The visual effects aren't that good and the action beats of extreme weather and cities falling never really put you in the action. In fact, all of this you've seen before in past Marvel films or other disaster flicks.

I'm actually horrified by what they did to Earth to prevent climate change. It's very unrealistic and too dumb.So his little brother took the position and left his older brother with no job. Note, they kicked the older brother who saved the world from extreme climate change. Then after years, the system messed up. The younger brother harassed his older brother and tells him to fix the mess with the Dutchboy, the technology that controls Earth's climate. The older brother was pressured more because of weird drama from her daughter so he decided to fix it.Another scrutiny, at Hong Kong, It's apparent that the crushed egg boils in the ground while the car tires don't? The science really failed in this film.At space, the analyst guy Dunkin is rude and they expect the station not infested with a rat? What an unethical workspace they have in space.And when Lawson's jetpack malfunction he unbelievably survive. That is so very unbelievable. Anyway, It's called entertainment. I should be entertained.Another one, the security woman went home, she's the wife of the younger brother, and she just heard a crushed object and she just called ""Max!""? Seriously, this is the kind of reaction you'll expect from a Secret Service Agent? And later she found a stranger and then her husband pops up behind her. The husband said it's okay, it's okay, it's okay and she's still pointing a gun at the visitor. That's so hilarious! It's so wrong. It's a very failed script.At space, they were searching for a high-tech USB device. The security guy just found them, pointing a gun at Lawson. Where Lawson is with the woman helping him search. You know who's that woman is? It's the Chief Scientist who's the boss of the security guy. Unbelievable! The security guy just did that in front of his boss. They should take Work Ethics in Space Station seriously. I guess, the Gun Control Law is not popular in Space Station.Another one, thunder hitting the Stadium and making the stadium explode. Is that even possible?!One scene, the President is arguing about Lawson serious accusation to Sec. of state while they're under Geostorm, I mean, where is his mind?So there's a geostorm all over the world, politically all power country will react. There is a serious repercussion to the US. I guess the sequel will be called Nuclear Storm.At the end part, they're fishing near a sandy beach shore. Very stupid indeed.

I first started seeing the graphics for the film and small snippets of the movie when it was first starting to be sponsored. My #1 reason to go see this movie was for the graphics, I love movies like these ones and it looked similar to 2012. I couldn't have been more wrong. It was basically 2012 but throw in a Gerard Bulter movie like Olympus Has Fallen and you basically get this mess. What made it boring was the huge amount of suspense but absolutely no delivery or drop after the build up. Trust me when I say this, but people were getting up to leave before it was over it was that incredibly boring. To make it worse my popcorn was cold. Save your money!",Geostorm

the plot focusing on a Geostorm should make you think, would this ever really happen? and Yes it could sure there was some plot hole here and there but this movie deserves its dues. Geostorm is a movie that not even the Syfy Channel could have done. This movie is a mix of movies that have typically been done before, I.E 2012 Sharknado Twister. Firestorm but adds a space element into the mix.Before would be critics try to write a review they should give this movie a second look and see that this movie has it's own style If something like this were to happen we would be defenseless against it, but it is a movie that should really make you think.",Geostorm

I probably would have walked out in the first ten minutes after the global warming alarmist BS prologue and the poorly acted first scenes of Leonidis being an a-hole in a congressional hearing. It really doesn't get much better from there. The acting is truly horrible and dialogue is laughable.

I looked at him and told him that it was better than 2012, movies like this according to him need to have more action in them, I disagreed. I believe this movie had all the elements necessary for a great movie, the highlight for me was the screenplay, the dialogue and the acting which were all tremendous. Every character played his/her part well and with real emotion. I was not in any way disappointed, I went to see a movie that I had a great expectations about and I walked out of the cinema feeling very satisfied. All these negative reviews am I seeing for this movie don't make sense, I think that we need to focus more on the individual elements that make up movies, not just looking at the movie as a whole.

436,mastersparky,Mostly cloudy with some bright spells throughout.,6,20 October 2017,"Earth is beset by natural disasters. In facing adversity, mankind developed a satellite station to prevent these catastrophes. While they overcome this problem. Another conflict arises... it becomes now becomes a weapon for global domination. Like most disaster movies, the parallels to our own present global situation aren't that far removed from what is showcased here. Technological advancements we invent to solve our crises have a very real threat of also being used against us or creating further dilemma. It's hugely exaggerated within this film but it was believable enough for me to buy into the plot.Ill be honest I didn't expect much from this film, even the name GEOSTORM sounds like a cheap and terrible Nat Geo, straight to TV movie. Plus after seeing the trailers that showcased some of the cheesiest lines found in the film I didn't have high hopes for this one.... However I found, once the storm had settled, it wasn't as bad as I expected it to be.Performance wise Gerard Butler did a sterling job as the main lead Jake Lawson, if not a little 'non scientist' looking. He also has great chemistry with his brother (played by Jim Sturgess) that becomes quite a heavy plot point through the middle half of the film. I personally found Jim's performance lacking throughout and was by far the weakest link in the main roster of actors found in here. Abbie Cornish plays the top Whitehouse security officer as well as Max's fiancée is not just a pretty face. While she more than sufficiently demonstrates her acting skills, her credentials for the ass-kicking, tough-as-nails, agent are all here. Jake's 13-year-old daughter Hannah played by Talitha Eliana Bateman, wins the audience's hearts hands down and its a shame she didn't get more screen time, what with her punchy lines and impressive emotional scenes. Now the main reason people go to see a disaster flick are for the special effects (if its for the deep meaningful story and the Oscar winning performances then WHURT? SHUT UP!) and they are plentiful. A handful of mysterious weather disasters early on wet your appetite for what's to come. One in particular that occurs in down-town Tokyo was really impressive! The action then shifts from the un-natural disasters to the mystery of why these errors in the storm controlling device (named Dutch Boy) are happening. And so begins the investigation and brotherly bonding section which tried and failed on making me really care for any of the on-screen characters. We meet the crew of Dutch Boy however the limited amount of time we are given to bond with these characters does very little in making us emotionally connect with them The unveiling of the conspiracy did keep my attention though and clichés aside, did a decent enough job in propelling the story along. The final act features some incredible special effects mixed with some pretty rough stuff too. Some stand out moments include a frozen plane plummeting out of the sky, the space station disaster and the exploding gas lines! Unfortunately many of these scenes we have already seen in previous disaster flicks such as Day After Tomorrow and Gravity. It lacks some originality here which may disappoint some viewers but overall the special effects are sufficient enough considering the scale of the effects present here.I also found the distance between intentional laughs is far too great, a few at the start, a few at the end... but not to worry as you will find yourself laughing during many of the 'heard it before' canned action dialogue scenes, stripped from the shelves of the most generic action movies. In the final stages the film is at risk of becoming too messy, we jump from country to county, disaster to disaster with little time to focus on any particular moment. The disaster movie clichés then fire at you from all sides, including the god awful 'doomsday clock' ticking down, we have the family situations, emotional moments, mandatory fists, guns and car chases, narrow escapes and cheesy one-liners (some cringe worthy) But this is a disaster flick. It's what you pay for right?Its a shame GEOSTORM didn't try anything different in a genre which is quickly becoming quite stagnant. Special effects were the main draw to these types of film but they are now so prominent in Hollywood that the wow factor has somewhat diminished. If you head into this with your brain turned off and a hunger for some large scale destruction then there is a lot of fun to be found in here... just don't expect a suntan.",Geostorm

It's a decent movie to go out and eat popcorn with a teenage nephew or niece.Much more than the lack of originality of the story, there's the issue that one doesn't really have anyone to root for.

Despite some clunky script at times & stereotyping I settled down to a film i found not so much a disaster movie but more a race against time mystery/thriller. And in that light I quite enjoyed it.The film is saved by some strong female characters (including Gerard's daughter who manages to convincingly resemble my own 12 year old - a mixture of plain speaking childhood vulnerability and strong common sense) plus a concept thats half believable, if hugely depressing (in light of recent weather disasters).

Law of nature: If nobody on the space station is aware of the lack of gravity, then so must you.When your highly-trained-professional-PhD-scientist-crew act like a bunch of undisciplined high school dropouts.So much money, time and effort spent in trying to tell a convincing story, to emerge the public into a world different to our own, only to keep yanking the viewer out of his dream state because of collosal mistakes in laws of nature, economics, etc.You'd think that people who make movies live in the same reality as the rest of us and is governed by the same laws of nature, like the rest of us.And once the bubble of make belief is destroyed, its hard to overlook tiny editing mistakes like a female computer geek looking confused at a dialog that says ""Connecting.."" like she's expecting it doesn't suppose to do this when you connect something to your computer.Painfully bad production.
Positive things about the movie:* SFX department did a good job.* Decor (especially the space station) felt rich and both believable while refreshing.* Casting: I like the fact that the computer geek was a female afro-american (the opposite to my worn out stereotypical computer geekness).* Acting: Good acting, yet new and refreshing faces which have me thinking ""that could be me"" rather than ""that is George Clooney / someone else"" (also a credit to casting).* Computer science: Stuff made sense. Kind of sad when you realize the movie got computer stuff correct, but simple everyday physics/nature wrong.I'm still 36 minutes into the movie (yeh I meant the part of being yanked out of the movie), but I predict that the super secret service girlfriend is in on some sabotage plot, hired by someone in the government who has a political agenda. Lets see if this movie is boringly predictable, or will actually surprise me. The plot is prolly going to be something like ""this weather technology is a weapon, we can't give away this weapon""........... oh snap..---Ok.. ultimate verdict.. this movie was surprisingly more enjoyable then I thought.. it just started really bad.. and although some things like the source of gravity was not explained, there seemed to be a consistent logical reason for it..

457,ggroover97,A total disaster.,2,23 November 2017,"""Geostorm"" is the directorial debut for Dean Devlin (""Flyboys""), a film producer and screenwriter most notable for producing various Roland Emmerich (""Independence Day: Resurgence"") films such as ""Stargate"", ""Independence Day,"" and ""Godzilla."" That connection can easily be felt here as ""Geostorm"" is the kind of film that would fit well within Emmerich's filmography. In truth however, ""Geostorm"" is the most moronic movie to be released this year and the worst disaster film to be released in recent memory. The film takes place in the near future where catastrophic natural disasters are halted with the aid of ""Dutch Boy,"" a system of satellites designed to control climate on a global scale. When the system begins to malfunction, a former lead architect is brought in to save the day and hopefully prevent a ""Geostorm"" from destroying the planet. Concerning disaster movies plots, this story is very basic. In fact, it is downright pedestrian. We have seen it in ""Armageddon"" and ""2012"" and ""San Andreas."" and ""Geostorm"" brings absolutely nothing new to the table. This can even be seen with our characters. Our disgraced lead architect is Jake Lawson, played by Gerard Butler (""London Has Fallen""). He is joined by Jim Sturgess (""Kidnapping Mr. Heineken"") as the protagonist's younger brother, Abbie Cornish (""Robocop"") as a U.S. Secret Service agent, Ed Harris (""Mother!"") as the U.S. Secretary of State, and Andy García (""Passengers"") as the president of the United States. All try their best, but the script is so clichéd and predictable that even Daniel Day-Lewis (""Lincoln"") wouldn't be able to salvage it. Not to mention some of the choices several characters make in the film defy all logic and reason. Despite being a disaster movie, ""Geostorm"" showcases not that many disaster sequences. In the entire film, only one disaster sequence is memorable, and even that ends as soon as it begins. The second act is completely devoid of any spectacle, and we are subjected to following a generic mystery surrounding sabotaged satellites. There is a rule for disaster films that people go to see them for the sole purpose of seeing amazing visual effects. ""2012"" did this decently. ""Geostorm"" does not. In fact, we are given effects that look on par with Syfy original movies. Not to mention that none of the main characters are involved in any of the disaster sequences, giving them no emotional weight or even a fleeting sense of urgency. In a nutshell, ""Geostorm"" is a big bore. In this day and age, the disaster genre is a dying breed due to a lack of fresh material. You need to bring in something fresh to reel audiences in. ""Geostorm"" once again, fails in this regard. In a disappointing October, ""Geostorm"" is not worth your time or money. Watch and support ""Blade Runner 2049"" if you want a better film with more substance, or wait a few weeks for the release for ""Thor: Ragnarok."" ""Geostorm"" is as entertaining to watch as a Syfy original movie. Hopefully, Devlin's next film, ""Bad Samaritan"" is an improvement over this wreck.",Geostorm

The direction was either underwhelming or completely missed the point. Only Harris, Beetz, and Schiff managed to give remotely convincing performances - Harris by the skin of his teeth - but Bateman and Butler (both of whom have been decent in the past) struggled with such a painful script. The rest of the cast were dire.
The plot had potential but the twists were obvious and the ending was just ridiculous.

What we get is a bunch of actors that are trying real hard to make their characters believable, but the dense script only carries them so far.The main problem is the tone and pacing. The movie doesn't really know what kind of movie it wants to be, which can be quite confusing. The viewer notices this almost instantly, and spends the rest of his or her time trying to figure out how much time there is left.Devlin made an OK job of it all, but the movie needs a sort of relevance and congeniality to be more than that.

It's almost amusing and insulting too see why they gave the rating they did . A lot of other successful titles are based on similar ideas . Why is gravity a better movie for example ? - to me that was a ''1 person'' type of movie , sitting in a place doing nothing... boring...., a 5 star movie ) About the movie , i liked it . Didn't got bored , it is an action packed sci-fi . It is pretty close to interstellar and die hard , in a good way ,but about 1/5 the emotional impact at least for me . But that is good , it was not intended to be that way .
The plot is allright , the climate change is a real deal (of course no one reading this is going to be affected in any meaningful way , but it's undeniable ) .

But opinions are like... Well, you know. And everybody has one.This honestly isn't as bad as a lot of people make it out to be. The premise is basic and simple to understand, the storytelling is solid (the way hundreds of other movies have done it), the visual effects aren't that many - I think most of them are in the trailer - but they're timely and done right, and go as far as getting a reaction. (Oh, my lord! I didn't know that was a thing!...)The editing though, can be nasty sometimes. The climax of a scene can abruptly end and immediately cut to its resolution and that's a little off putting if you're slightly aware how editing works.Was there enough meat for the actors to sink their teeth into? Probably not. But that's just the nature of blockbusters in general, and this is no exception. It's all about the premise and the drama. And to be fair, even that is well achieved to the point where you think the ending is pretty much certain, until it isn't.And most of all, which I think is the overarching theme that few people seem to be talking about, is that it tackles a real life problem we all face and what its most dire consequences can be in the most extreme circumstances, even without the sci-fi portion of it. I'm guessing a lot of people reacted poorly to that alone, because honestly, looking in the mirror in the matter of climate change, sucks.But objectively, as storytelling and move making goes, the movie delivers a solid, balls to the wall, piece of narrative and action, which is to be praised, not criticized.",Geostorm

And when you go and see this movie,... it turns out to be more than just a blockbuster.First of all,... watch this movie as if it were a horror flick,... but not about gore, blood and 'guts',... but about climate change, stupid politics and 'Global collaboration'. For many, as good as it might be made,... it simply had to be bad.Why it is as good as the very best horror flick: because it is all the way over the top, like any good horror. At the same time,... it has something under it's skin,... close to reality. The acting was good though surprising: I saw real actors alongside comic figures, and that is fresh. I can understand that some find it 'bad', but it is not, only extra-ordinary. This is the 21th century,... anything goes in movies... even that blasphemous idea (OMG) of having a worldwide understanding among all Nations United. Booh, booh...? And the silly idea about corrupt politicians up to committing genocide,... nah,... none could believe that,... right? So this movie seems to be made to be repulsive to many, like the best horror movie does, because it confronts us with our greatest fear of loosing this one planet that we have,... scary because it's so close to reality once again. That makes (spoiler alert) the grid in the movie an allegory, and the critics who burn it down scared people. Job well done,... but a pity many follow the critics. Job way to well done? Conclusion: this big budget scifi horror-esque disaster flick is so well made that critics vomit on it and and those who hoped to see an intelligent space odditty get stomped in the guts. One thing is certain: this movie is one you will hate or love. Watch beyond the cgi and fiction,... forget the comic-esque story and see beyond the guts.It is not the greatest movie ever, but is goes beyond our wildest fears of (nah this is no spoiler alert) having leaders with the will to destroy humanity and gamble with mother earth. And that is what a great horror movie does: show reality in a way that our mind can't cope with it, but the guts understands. The silly characterization, the great cgi, the pathetic father-child relation,... it's what many see,... but not what makes you vomit.Yes,... this is a great story. Letˋs hope we don't see the and.

494,BadMovieFan94,Exactly What I Expected,7,16 November 2017,"This movie was exactly what I expected, and my expectations weren't particularly high. It was highly entertaining, but in no way was a good movie. It's entertainment derived solely from its predictable one-liners, predictable characters, predictable situations, and predictable outcome. In fact, I honestly could have seen the movie without walking into the theater, and yet curiosity still compelled me enough to go see Gerad Butler in a space suit. I was the only one in the theater.The idea behind the movie is actually pretty clever, and honestly the CGI is pretty impressive. Visually the movie was great, and I enjoyed watching people freeze, planes crash, and explosions in space.The characters, writing, and plot were entirely what I expected them to be. Some of my favorite highlights were: The laughable attempts at strained family relationships, (including the scene where in the middle of a tense daughter-father conversation, the daughter mentions that her lyft has arrived and it cuts to extended shot of a shiny Chevy Bolt coming down the driveway), the hot blonde who is also an under-appreciated bad ass, the ""look at me I am a good guy"" Mexican, the evil isolationist with a desire to MAGA, the hero democrat (yes his political affiliation is heavily emphasized, why even try to hide the bias at this point) who loves globalism and the UN, the female scientist, the alpha male who gets put in his place by the female scientist, people shouting things like ""but if you stay, you will die!"" and ""I know but I have to, it's to save the world"", a race to beat a literal countdown clock, and people clapping in ""that NASA room"" when the hero lives. I am not saying these are bad things, just that I walked into the movie knowing they were going to happen, and laughing when they did. The movie was actually pretty entertaining because of this. So if you were looking for an original and exciting action / disaster movie, then too bad. But if you saw the previews and said to yourself ""I know exactly what this movie is going to be, and I am okay with that"" like I did, then sit back and enjoy.",Geostorm

The 1st part of the movie (1 hour in) is just a bunch of conversations and situations happening to figure out who's leading the world into a major disaster that doesn't happen until the very end of the movie with no dramatic or objective acting scenes. The movie is too fast paced with the acting and it seems like it was cheaply made to an extent! The science is extremely bad! Worst I have ever seen that it's not even entertaining! There's one scene where a bunch of people freeze at split second on a beach in Rio from one of the satellite malfunctions involved in this movie. Compare that to the hurricane freeze scenes in The Day After Tomorrow (That felt more realistic). The movie feels like The Core (Compare the laser from the satellite with the EM spike hit on the Golden Gate Bridge), but not in a good way because I thought that was more slow paced and original. I felt sorry for the actors involved in this movie especially Ed Harris, he's done much better movies! This was terrible. The plot to kill the bad guys was too easy! If this movie were to be a hit and something you could love to watch over and over again they should have added a ton of high intense disaster scenes in the middle of the movie from satellite malfunctions of some sort, make a plot to where they are after a bad guy or bad guys leading down to the very end + Maybe a ransom against the main character's daughter if they don't meet with their demands for something, and develop an intense fighting scene with a timer for the ultimate Geostorm right in place with disaster taking place currently before the main thing happens near the end of the movie. The ending is like something of Armageddon (the movie) in a very fast paced and unexpected way that changes the tone too fast! Skip this movie, watch Deep Impact, San Andreas, The Day After Tomorrow, 2012, The Core, or other early notable disaster movies that were made right! Hollywood needs to go back to originality and keep it that way! The movie is too easy with the villains and the disaster was unexpected and not explainable (In other words, it didn't make any chronological or scientific sense) compared to when you watch other real disaster movies involving something natural or informative that makes sense! Whoever directed this is no Roland Emmerich, Michael Bay, or Steven Spielberg! CGI is bad too! Stay away from this and watch what I recommended you'll be glad you did!",Geostorm

I get it, if the government is involved in the plot of a movie there may be a political agenda attached, but they angle the movie in an attempt to influence personal views. No doubt creating a one sided plot and preaches to the audience. Not to mention the ""one world"" new world order type agenda shoved down our throats.

Sure, there are a few elements of this movie that feels like Armageddon and 2012, but it's obviously clear that debuting director Dean Devlin made no effort in trying to differ from the disaster film drama. If you've experienced films like 2012 or the Day After Tomorrow, watching this film will give you the same experience. To critics, yes, it will be a bad film. After the first few minutes of the movie I seemed to just turned off my professional features and lowered my ego and just tried to watch this film.

If I was watching this film from the perspective of an average film viewer. Without a doubt, I would have a lot of fun watching this like the stereotypical blockbuster action summer movie over the years. In my professional perspective, does this film have any flaws? Yes, tons. Some of the characters felt pretty pointless and the character development is just terrifyingly bad. The pacing itself felt too rushed and some of the performances didn't work out for me. Even though the audience was awed by some of the action scenes, it didn't impressed me much since I've seen this with other films in the past. The film's theme of brotherhood also didn't seem to fit the movie because of the film's plot. The plot is obviously clichéd, like something from Die Hard...in space! If you're planning to see this film, I expect you to just turn off your professional features and enjoy this flick like a dumb monster movie made to make money. Sure, it could end up on critics' lists as the worst (probably) or mediocre money making movies of the year.

Coming back to the screenplay: Why did they set it so close in the future (next year, 2019)? They could have just done that usual science fiction method of 'the near future'. The technology shown in the film is decades away. But the worst aspect of the film is the dialogue, excrutitatingly bad. The Director is Dean Devlin, who has an excellent track record in production, has directed only TV up to this point and maybe he should have left it at that.

I regret to say that not even all those clichés are scattered throughout the entire movie, but have compromised the very premise. Since you know what the story is about, I'm just gonna point out some of the most dazzling stereotypes here.1. A catastrophic global-scale disaster solves all the familial issues and reunites all the siblings (and divorced couples in many cases).
2. There's a kid who knows everything the best and she's just too mature for her age.
3. The huge twisters just decide to kill hundreds of people but spare a pet dog.
4. The government won't listen to scientists and is basically corrupt.
5. There's this cryptic message scene where you're supposed to get excited because it's so chilling.
6. The saboteur is always among us.
7. The protagonist won't die under any circumstances and will make his way out of an atomic-bomb-scale explosion, because he's the hero and this is your perfect disaster movie.
8. And he's never left alone by the girl he happens to like.
9. There's barely 5 minutes of this so-called geostorm throughout the movie, with unconvincing special effects.
10. The good scientist who knows what's happening has to die, so that our heroes can know that there's a conspiracy at work.

Combine this with the speed at which this occurred, physics says that he hits the 'van' at the same speed as he pushed off the object that set him in motion... they missed out on a terrifying inevitable slow motion scene where physics are faithfully depicted. Instead we get hurry it up and on to the next hurried up scene... Weather patterns- don't change like a light switch going on, they would take time, a slow motion build to mother nature's terrifying unleashing, not, Clap on- instant tsunami, clap on, instant super-freeze!

649,erhornsimon,Yes it is a no-brainer but very entertaining!,9,24 January 2020,"Normally I would rate this movie a solid 7/10.
But I gave it two extra points just to level out some of the stupid 1/10 ratings. Who honestly complains about the scientific accuracy of a science-fiction movie that is obviously not scientific. That would be the same as rating an elephant on its ability to climb a tree. Of course it sucks but nevertheless it might be a beautiful elephant that is good at elephant-things. Same goes for this Movie. Yes it lacks some depth and brilliant acting at one or another scene. But the cast is phenomenal, the CGI is good and it has a tense but happy ending.
This movie is good for anyone that likes Desaster-Movies for a cozy Friday evening after a hard working week.
Watch it and form your own opinion!",Geostorm
650,micheal_joseph,Geostorm...Quite possibly the most misunderstood movie of all time,8,20 April 2018,"Dean Devlin's Geostorm is a very clever rendition of the ever increasing scientific illiteracy present in modern society. The movie is a satire of science. Much of the science depicted is not only wrong but in fact deliberately ass-backwards. This was done brilliantly with great precision but evidently far too subtle for most people to grasp. The fact that not a single reviewer could recognise the underlying tone and message or appreciate his wit and humour is both saddening and deeply troubling given the current state of the world and the challenges we face.As much as I was surprised and impressed by this movie I wish he had gone in a different direction. Given such a large budget, his credentials as a Sci-fi writer and his obvious understanding of science and engineering, he could have easily employed real science and made this a serious movie. Especially after the recent success of movies such as The Martian and Interstellar which are heavily grounded in science and facts rather than fiction. He had the opportunity to create an important movie that could have educated the audience but instead choose to poke fun at their ignorance. But still, I appreciate his humour.",Geostorm

653,starburstrai,Juat too bad to watch.,1,16 October 2020,While it was fun to see the space scenes the whole plot seems to be too incredible to be true. Could all the conspiracy theories have got past all the secret service agents seems to be beyond belief. Unfortunately the worst part of the whole story is that the countdown before the destruction is stopped is just a few seconds. This happens in every film where the hero stops the bomb etc. just when there are 2 or 3 seconds left. Its getting to be so predictable that it is no longer exciting. Why not have a film where the countdown is stopped with a few minutes left on the clock. That would be more fun to watch. Anyway the film was a C-film. Watch if nothing else catchs your fancy.,Geostorm
654,bhowardh,Cliched... and that's about it,3,5 October 2021,"The whole film is building up to this gigantic moment, where all types of natural disasters were going to wipe out the planet. If this movie would have been a race for survival against the geostorm, it would be better. But no, we see a tornado and intense lightning, and then a spaceship explodes. Believe it or not, this movie ACTUALLY has a countdown sequence where the main character presses it at the last second. Also, the writing for the female agent sucks. Her only character trait is work, work work. And don't forget, she's a sharpshooter.",Geostorm
655,m-xdd-y,Deeply average.,5,3 March 2021,"If you've seen any action film ever, you've seen Geostorm.Gerard Butler plays an ant-establishmentarian with a heart of gold deep down (and a ropey American accent) who is the only person who can save the world when Dutch Boy, the sci-fi super satellite designed to stop the effects of global warming, starts going wrong. In essence, the same character he has in every other film he has appeared in. Except this time, in space.It's an interesting premise that isn't played out to its full potential, but the film itself is non-offensive. The special effects are slightly questionable for a film that is, at time of writing, not even four years old, but if you can get over that then the rest of the film is fine. It's just incredibly formulaic - not necessarily to the point of boredom, but it's certainly not something I'm anchoring to watch again.In all, this is a good film for background noise, or perhaps if you're looking for something which requires little to no thought. However, if you're looking for a thrills-a-minute, visionary action flick, I would maybe look elsewhere.",Geostorm

661,matiasbravojara,One of the worst movies I've seen in years,2,26 October 2017,I went to see Geostorm because it was the only movie playing on a night where I really wanted to go to the 4D-cinema. Since it was a disaster movie I figured it would go well with the big screen and the 4D-effects.Right from start I felt that something was off. The dialogue and over all atmosphere felt tacky and the acting didn't seem genuine. This was only the beginning though.Geostorm is filled with canned dialogue and clichés that will make you cringe. Most of the actors under perform and there's no real chemistry between the main actors.During the whole movie you feel like you're watching a movie that you've already seen and the tropes used are so in-your-face that you almost feel provoked.I was thinking about leaving several times during the movie but since I was with friends I decided to stay. During the climax of the movie several people in the audience were loudly mocking the movie and laughing at the absurdity of it all.Everything about Geostorm was a disaster. It was very predictable and preachy and the director actually made you feel dumb throughout most of the movie. The only OK thing was the CGI but even that felt re-used and tired.Nobody should watch this movie. It's utterly bad and should be avoided at any cost. I don't even want to think about how much money was spent on this garbage,Geostorm
662,dalib0r,Really really bad movie,2,29 October 2017,"I was really looking forward to see this movie after I saw trailer for it. Oh, how I was wrong. I can't remember when have I seen such a bad movie in every aspect of it. Stupid dialogues, bad acting, really shallow plot... And of course, how can we bypass politics from real life... In movie, several countries participate in making the technology for saving Earth, but no Russians, they are bad, they don't want to save planet where they live... Really... Puke... At least I've collected a lots of points on my Cinema bonus card, so I watched it for free...",Geostorm
663,chd-1,What a mess,2,3 August 2021,"This is a ridiculous mess. Unfortunately it finds that narrow gap between bad enough to be entertaining in its badness, yet too bad to be worth much in any semi-serious watching. It clearly got a decent budget; stuff blows up fairly well, if that's enough for you.Terrible writing, and acting ranging from terrible to phone-it-in-and-send-me-the-check from a few big names in small parts who probably lost a bet to be here. Abbie Cornish probably does the best, but really has nothing to work with.",Geostorm
664,vpennock,This movie would make Roland Emmerich cry,4,18 January 2021,"Let's start with the premise of this movie, because it doesn't start out THAT bad. They took an OK premise, coupled it with every cliché they could think of, wrote some painfully awkward dialogue, and coupled it with some mediocre special effects(more on that later.) Let's start with the cast; one of the few things that wasn't done too poorly in this film. The problem with the casting wasn't the actors or the roles they were chosen for, but the fact that the director seems to have hand picked the cast and said to them ""do you remember the character you played in that one movie? Can you do that character again?"". Gerard Butler is back as the generic modern, intelligent tough guy, but his role isn't the worst by far. Ed Harris really steals the show reprising his ""bad guy with a messed up conscience"" role plucked straight from National Treasure 2. While the movie is watchable and the space and disaster sequences aren't done too poorly; I really have a problem with the production's use of special effects in sequences that would be easier to shoot in reality. There are several obvious CGI sequences involving vehicles that just look clunky and unrealistic, almost like they were created in GTA on the PlayStation 2. On a movie with a budget this large of a budget you would think they could afford to rent a few stock movie cars and do a simple three hour shoot instead of faking it for a scene that doesn't even involve explosions. If you disregard the made up science, poorly written dialogue, and the sheer lack of intelligence in this film, you'll see that it could've been a much better package. This right here is a great example of lazy modern film-making that makes even the cheesiest Roland Emmerich disaster movie seem terrifyingly realistic.",Geostorm

I LOVE IT! 5,8?? Why critics always so mean! we are human, we never perfect. Talk about perfect, including this movie. At least, critics should appreciate them. This movie is sooo entertaining , I LOVE IT!Maybe the concept is not too original. Hey, who is doing original these days, especially considering that this is an art. Every artist always have their own inspiration whom done it firstI am a big fan of disaster movie. Almost every disaster movie i have watched it. I think its fair enough to say that this movie is truly awesome. I mean it! That's because i compare it. I am not going to talk the detail, but here's what i think about this movie : Everything is GREAT! the only thing that ""not so great"" about this movie is the special effect , its just a view of them. The majority of special effects are great, but, when the tornados (yes, multi tornados) appears, that is the ""not so great"" part.I think the visual special effect need more to be polished, especially the multi tornados part. Thats it. No more critics.The Actor? Hey this is Gerard Butler. What so bad about him? i think he and the rest of the actor doing great with their partsAndy Garcia! I always love his voice, its such charismatic. He always the right person doing his part as high profile person, such as a president. Reminding me with Barrack Obama with his great voice & cool attitudeOne of my favorite part about this movie is, the director knows how to mix politic and natural disaster...and also the humor part. That's all. My advice, this movie is highly recommended. Just go to the cinema and watch the awesomeness of this movie. Especially if you are a die hard fan of disaster movie.",Geostorm

The purpose of the film is to give you a ride which you may think to be enjoyable but not to enlighten you. it has flaws even in human interaction but you might bear it.

I don't know any movie that caught me literally sleeping in cinema.Anyways, script was so cliché that there was nothing unexpected there. And this is story not about Armageddon or anything similar, this is a story of 2 brothers, who fight with each other and ""good"" and ofc ""bad"" guys. There is also so much nonsense, people are using gasoline cars, but they are able to deploy millions of satellites and make net over whole damn earth. Rockets are like deployed every day, multiple times, by not new tech, but current rocket system, which is unbelievable stupid.He is sitting in a rocket the same way like when you would go to supermarket to buy groceries, just turn on and fly to the space. And let's forget all these things, but the thing that HE BUILT THE NET is most amazing stupidity in the movie. There is one good, and one bad guy. Why people cannot be good and bad at same time in this kind of cliché movies. The ""bad"" guy is destroying world intentionally. This can be compared to a guy who tries to open a packaged food can with a nuclear bomb. This is nothing.I ignored even nonsense about instant weather changes, where people are burning and out of sudden, just 2 meters away there is normal temperature and there is NO WIND. Whoever cooked the soup know that soup starts moving in all directions on temperature change, similar goes with the air. but, author of this script doesn't understand that. With this budget he SHOULD KNOW that almost everyone knows the basics of physics. But let's forget even this.The thing that during the movie you figure out the resolution of conversation after 10-30 seconds, but conversation lasts for another 10 minutes. This made me so bored that I couldn't watch it. This killed, destroyed and vanished all my will to watch movie.Terrible, very very stereotypical American, physics taken from some other universe and truly awful.

I can tell by the glowing 10/10 reviews from all over the world already posted that none of these people have actually seen this movie.I appreciate the free tickets and I was keen to see this on the big screen for all its big budget CGI. There's nothing like seeing global destruction in high definition. I do like Gerard Butler, Jim Sturgess and Abbie Cornish but the predictable script and cringe- worthy lines just had me constantly snickering and face palming. I get the feeling that one of the many re-shoots included the line from Butler ""we are American but my brother and I were born in England"" to explain the awful American accents the two were doing. I mean Butler's Irish accent can almost pass but I have no idea what Brooklyn good-fellas accent Sturgess was trying on. The drama that goes on between the brothers is totally inane. The movie treats the audience like an idiot, over-explaining every action the characters make. Abbie Cornish is absolutely gorgeous but she's too soft to be cast as a secret service agent.The CGI was OK (good enough to create a juicy trailer) but the TV movie script had my wife begging me to leave half way through.

Who even thought of the first ""timer"" movie?? They are ridiculous. We all know the hero wins and the clock stops somewhere between 1 and 4 seconds before the so called Armageddon event happens. They don't add suspense, they don't add interest, they just lower a movie a complete eyesore. Who decided ""oh yes what we need is a stupid clock that stops at 1 second before the end of the world?""

Perhaps I have to realize that I'm becoming really old, and this kind of visual show can't impress med anymore.The story was full of clichés. Actors ? Average or poor acting, like all the things in this movie. No emotions at all, zero. I did not get any link with the characters, no empathy created at all.I can't see the interest of this kind of movie. I would say it's rather a product than a movie. I think it's the last time I do see this kind of thing. I've seen two real movies just before this, and it was not a waste of time and money. This one, Geostorm, to go to the cinema to see it ?

Despite having advance warning of the failings of this movie, I thought I'd at least enjoy the usual disaster movie special effects. Which I did. They were, unfortunately, married to the chunkiest dialogue and the overuse of every trope available; the boy and his dog, the character running just in front of the advancing line of destruction, characters looking at computer screens and immediately diagnosing the problem from a few lines of code; and the totally unoriginal family dynamic. Even the bad guys are obvious.
The introduction to the plot in a voice over by Gerard Butler's screen daughter even avoids saying the two words which are in everyone's mind- climate change- and calls it ""extreme weather"". The solution, looking like a literal Skynet, is way beyond our current abilities. But then there is no explanation about how any of this could work or how they managed to get all the hardware up there, or even how they could generate gravity. Pie in the sky, indeed.
The special effects are good, a great deal of money thrown at the screen. However, the plot, the cheddar cheesiness of the dialogue, and disbelief in the technology (they would have done better setting this in 2059 onwards not 2019ish). Even the actors, and here we have good cast, have no real conviction. The money must have been good. Overall, it didn't alleviate the post sport blues I had.",Geostorm

Think Moonlighting a la Bruce Willis and Sybil Shepard meets any line spoken by Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator. Perhaps this will be the springboard for director Dean Devlin for bigger and better things as even James Cameron had to start somewhere. Save your money and valuable time by staying home and watching Babe: Pig in the City.

Yes the movie itself reminded me of The Day After Tomorrow because it shared a similar genre but other then that I loved what the movie had to offer. It showed us what could happen if the government was allowed to control something so large and make it into a weapon of mass destruction. It shows that mother nature if she could possibly be controlled would be a force to reckon with. Now I would highly advise to not build something like this but it is from a movie so we as people do not know if it could possibly be done. For all the ones who are slamming this movie whether you have seen it or not is ridiculous, yes it may not be a block buster movie with a high end director or amazing high end actors/actresses does not mean it will be bad.

736,hakffm,CGI effects worth seeing - but one of the actors spoiled the movie,5,21 October 2017,"I went to see the movie in 3D only for the CGI and enjoyed the in- and outside of the space station and satellites - impressive and creative details and effects. The disaster effects on earth are quite convincing, the freezing of waves and people are surprising. I don't want to repeat, what others have written about the so-so acting, it is a pity, that one cannot really warm up with the main characters. But there is one actor who really spoils the movie for me: Jim Sturgess. If he was only the younger brother Max, okay. But he is such a big miscast for the important and story driving role as head of the 'Dutch Boy' program: such person should have quite some charisma but in every one of his scenes the only thought you can have is: this person never could be the head of such a global operation. And this thought starts to push you out of the ongoing story and every scene with him increases the distance that builds up between you and the ongoing story. This unrealistic acting pushes you more and more out of the movie and makes you angry instead of drawing you deeper into the story.How can a director of such a big budget film accept such acting and role understanding?Sorry for that, Geostorm!",Geostorm

Every part makes sense and nothing is left unanswered.Brief description about this movie- Jake (Gerard Butler) creates satellites in outer space that prevents catastrophe events on earth. The government and president have access to these satellites and ends up hacking the system with a virus so that the satellites turn against earth and cause super storms and freak weather killing people within minutes. They wanted to do this to kill everyone on earth and start ""fresh"" but Jake is a genius and knows the system because he created it.. and does what he can to prevent a geostorm from happening.

739,lipstikover,"""Geostorm"", a storm that will pass by and you won't even notice",6,25 October 2017,"Review by Marianna TórgoEvery year we have at least one movie about the apocalypse and how the world is going to end until USA shows up, in last second, to save the day. The last couple ones released were pretty bad, like ""San Andreas"" (2015) and ""2012"" (2009), and you may ask yourself why. Well, those movies were great in the special effects area, but when it comes to developing a consistent script they are train wrecks. When people left the cinema they could say that ""at least the effects were pretty good"", ""Geostorm"" doesn't even have that wild card to save its own skin. Promoted as an apocalypse film, ""Geostorm"" doesn't really show disaster scenes, since 94% of screen time is dedicated to zooming in Gerard Butler or Jim Sturgess faces. The plot surrounds ""Dutch Boy"", a giant satellite built to protect earth from sandstorms, blizzards and every natural disaster possible. ""Dutch Boy"", built by Gerard Butler and his crew, is starting to show defects, putting life on earth in risk. Although, is it just a casualty system error or someone is trying to bring ""Dutch Boy"" down? There is where the plot starts. Gerard Butler is the classic big brother who fights and drinks by 11 a.m, and, deep down in his good guy heart, is looking for redemption. There is nothing new to see here, we saw Gerard perform this same type of character over and over. His brother, played by Jim Sturgess, works for the government and doesn't talk to or visit Gerard's character after firing him from ""Dutch Boy"" project ""for not being responsible"". After ""Dutch Boy"" shows its first error, Jim Sturgess goes after his brother to fix it, since he is the only one that can do the job. The script tries to captivate you with this brother issue, but it doesn't spark any flame. Gerard Butler, surprisingly, does his part; the problem here is Jim Sturgess. All the scenes in which the public should connect with their relationship are cringy, Jim Sturgess can't cry or change his expression. However, what saves Jim Sturgess' scenes is Abbie Cornish, who plays a government secret agent that is secretly romantically involved with him. She is a bad ass, who shines in action parts but also moves you when she cries. Speaking about action parts, they are the best thing about the movie – and trust me, this is not a good thing when you are an apocalypse movie. The disaster scenes are borderline offensive, showing stereotype versions of each country: When Brazil appears, it shows Rio de Janeiro's beach with a bunch of hot, tanned and muscled people. When Dubai appears, we see a man on the back of a camel in the desert, and the list goes on - you get what I'm saying. They are not more offensive because there isn't enough screen time for it, the disaster scenes are just as fast as you at the cinema regretting after buying the ticket to see this movie, thinking ""I should have watched The It movie again, that was worthy of my money and time"". Don't get me wrong, I do like the whole ""Dutch Boy"" idea, and how it is something that – probably – will come true someday. The plot of mystery and discovering who or what is behind the technical errors is also interesting, but the way the movie was made it just doesn't land. My problem with ""Geostorm"" comes from the fact that it is not a 0/10 or a 10/10, it is basic and flat, a good 6/10, and it could've been so much more. I would recommend this movie if you have some extra time that you want to spend watching some explosions here and there with a little good old plot twist , but if you're looking for amazing disaster scenes (as promoted in the movie trailer) and good acting skills, you will be disappointed. ""Geostorm"" sounded like a giant storm but ended up being just a light breeze, which soon will be forgotten just like every recent disaster/end of the world movie released.",Geostorm

This movie kept me on the edge of my seat and wanting to know more. Going into the theater, I expected this movie to be all about the weather and climate elements, but I was interested to see that it was more of a tech, sci-fi mystery. While the random storms that were happening were not just random, they had been intentionally done by someone.The movie is basically a ""who done it"" trying to figure out who infiltrated the system and wants the entire world dead. A majority of the movie is filmed on a space station which is where the sci-fi aspects come in. Although Geostorm had some sub par acting, and the ending was completely typical and happy, it was well filmed and kept the viewer interested the whole time. This movie is more comparable to ""2012,"" ""San Andreas,"" ""Passengers,"" or any type of world destruction movie rather than a weather and climate based movie.

Since you can not order a free ticket in advance, we had to see what was still available. The choice fell on Geostorm after we were seduced by the trailer.

Ed Harris remains a delicious rat bag and there were still some big names so that was definitely alright. The speed in the movie is great, you do not feel bored. The special effects are incredibly good, yes the story may be far sought, but still fairly up-to-date.

750,jluvyt,Non-continuity of racial bias.,6,3 December 2017,"There is a little bit spoiler in my review, if you haven't watched this movie, this is a warning. The reason I said this movie is ""racist"" is because of the existence of a character named ""Ray Bussette"" acted by ""Amr Waked"". At the beginning of the movie, when the black technique guy steal data from the space station with a very nervous and scared face (seems to be threatened by some villain) and hide the ram to a locker, then there was a scene that he had eye contact with this ""Ray Bussette"". After that, this black guy was murdered in the space station. Ray is a Mexican with a Buzz cut hairstyle, brown skin, and a ""tough guy"" face. At that time, I have no doubt that Ray is one of the villains, and he killed the black guy. When audience thinks about a Mexican male, the tags might be like ""gangs"", ""drugs"", illegal immigrants"", because those tags seem like truth (however it is not, it is just TV realism). ""Ray"" as a character has some idealized screen expression as this kind of ""bad Mexican guy"". When our protagonist, Jake Lauson (acted by Gerard Butler) said there is a SPY in the team, I believe that ""Ray"" came out to most of audiences' first guess. However, Ray is not a villain, he did save Jake's life, but when Ray was proved being clean, the movie went through 3 quarters already. Thank Ray, the real villain could be successfully hidden for such long time, producer misleads audience for such long time. And when the real boss showed out, the astonishment is very successful to me. There are many ""apparent clue"" that lead audience to suspect this Mexican as a bad guy, and producer use this racial bias to cover and hide the true villain, I would like to say that thanks to the non-continuity of using racial bias, this movie is not as boring as other typical ""American saves the world""-movie.",Geostorm
751,kevinlee-05904,"From a scientific standpoint, there's a better chance of Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs happening than Geostorm.",1,12 December 2017,"Geostorm, where the Secretary of State creates god-like weather forces in attempt to destroy the world of all lesser people, and almost does it way too easily. Not only is the plot of this movie utterly dull and without substance, the dialogue and character development were created with very little thought or attempt to create a serious disaster movie. At times, different conversations that go on throughout the movie are completely laughable, for example, the relationship between Jake Lawson (Gerald Butler) and his brother Max (Jim Sturgess). It's almost like they finished writing the movie, and the group of people in charge of dialogue needed some type of power battle and controversy, despite the Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs-type weather scenario. Actually, Geostorm doesn't even deserve to be in the same sentence as Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, because Geostorm tries to make their weather seem realistic in a catastrophic type scenario when in reality it isn't even close. There's a better chance of animals or food coming from the sky than anything shown in Geostorm. Therefore, I'm going to explain in depth why each part of the movie's ability to control the weather and how it acts, is just plain made up Hollywood movie magic.
 First of all, the way the movie depicts the controlling of weather makes absolutely no sense. To shoot bullet-like pieces from space into a storm to release some form of technology that would entirely dissipate the storm is simply just impossible. Even shooting a bullet into a hurricane does nothing but create a very dangerous object that could strike and kill somebody. The idea that hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of these pods that enter a storm and destroy it entirely wouldn't do the exact same thing important to remember. The impact of these pods were only in one location, yet the entire storm went away in the flash of an eye, which is just Hollywood magic. The atmosphere is so big that if something were to affect a portion of it, it would not have an overall effect on the atmosphere as a whole, it would be isolated; that's how the atmosphere works the way it does. The fact of the matter is that even a volcanic eruption or a gigantic nuclear warhead could not deter or even change the direction of some of the storms shown in the movie to evaporate before our eyes.
 The first freak accident to occur in the movie was when the small town in Afghanistan is frozen instantly, causing everyone there to die instantaneously. For this to occur there would need to be a zone of such extreme low pressure that the temperatures would drop that dramatically, but at this time, there is no such ""freeze ray"" that could complete such a ridiculous task. Another great freak accident that makes also zero sense is why Dubai gets practically washed away (the water would destroy the foundations of those buildings due to the rocking back and forth) and somehow it is at the fault of the satellites. At some point, it seems like the creators of this movie gave up on any feasible weather patterns or potential disastrous storms and just went for the disasters that made the least sense.
 Lastly, the entire appeal of this movie is from the creators of the movie entirely making up the term ""geostorm"", as if there was a term for a massive slew of tornadoes, tsunamis and earthquakes. All of the significant weather depicted in the movie is over exaggerated to the point that it isn't even possible on earth's surface. The fact is that this movie was created as a cash grab for the people who think recent natural disasters mean our world will soon be at risk to far worse, but in reality, it's all just conspiracy theories right now. Although the movie is portrayed as a scientific thriller, it's more of an imaginative world where science and more specifically the science behind weather, do no exist. After asking a current PhD meteorologist who works for weather.us if he had any details that would help me right this review, his response was, ""I would not subject myself to that mental torture.""",Geostorm

The parts of the geostorm coming were superb, It really held my attention throughout the movie.
Only part I would have changed was when the geostorm was over Dubai.... I wouldn't have stopped it that quick :) Would have been nice to see those Arabs get what they deserved.",Geostorm
754,mrstevenyates,Why?,2,23 December 2017,"Special effects were not bad(some of them) . That's the positive.
The negative was the rest of the movie due to the poor script.A huge amount of unnecessary dialog.
Warning :Spoiler alert.They send Gerard Butlers character up to the space station as the only one who can sort the situation out and the scenes that follow are just ridiculous. Jim Sturgess character needed to 'squinch' at the screen and make threats that if 'Jake ever authorizes anything he hasn't approved he will fire him' even though Jake is the only one who can solve the problem and he knows he can't fire him. Maybe he just wanted to show he was a grown up.And the movie was littered with them. Abbie Cornish's character as a secret agent. Feels the need to scream 'get down!' after bullets come through the rear window of the car. It's a very secret agent thing to say I suppose but it just came across as cheesy.The space stations 'self destruct sequence' gets activated (like that's a real thing and not something equally cheesy from 80's movies) and during evacuation the chief scientist feels the need to tell everyone to 'keep going' and 'hurry' like an exploding space station doesn't already motivate people to do that.Plus many more. From Robert Sheehan's poor British accent and poor acting to big actors sporting out not very important things that are already obvious to everyone.
In the end I couldn't help but ask 'why?'
Why direct this movie like this?
Why is this script so cheesy?

Corruption at the highests levels of GVT. It's the who's who in Corruption and Deception.The good part is that if you open your eyes and your mind you will find liberation, in understanding how the Democratic Party works against the everyday person, Pandering for votes while plotting your destruction.

Although I thought was overdone, it got the point across. About messing with the weather, destroying populations for the sake of sustained populations in areas. It came out a few days after the worst fire in Ca history, and it definitely gives insight into possibilities, especially after knowing the history of UN Agenda 21. Read 'Behind the Green Mask' a book that was published in 2011. It's interesting how the fires happened just before 2018, where the city of Santa Rosa has a power of eminent domain that expires (in 2018.) As I sat listening to the news, October 8, 2017, about 8 pm, unusually high winds were taking place, then 5 fires popped up around Santa Rosa, at the same time. The rest was a disaster. Then the movie came out about a week later. The subject and the timing couldn't be more perfect. I'm surprised that so many said the movie was stupid.
