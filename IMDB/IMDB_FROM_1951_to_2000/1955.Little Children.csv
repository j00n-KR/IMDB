0,SnoopyStyle,love everything except the narration,7,11 July 2016,"Sarah Pierce (Kate Winslet) is in a loveless marriage and her husband is obsessed with internet porn ""Slutty Kay"". She is the least prepared mother in her group at the playground. The others have taken to calling Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson) the ""prom king"" who brings his son to the park. He's married to documentary maker Kathy Adamson (Jennifer Connelly) and supposed to be studying for his bar exam but he doesn't. The girls are too scared to talk to him so Sarah decides to do it. They kiss to shock them but he can't leave it behind him. Brad's friend former cop Larry Hedges (Noah Emmerich) is obsessed with recently released pervert Ronnie J. McGorvey (Jackie Earle Haley).Todd Field delivers another awards worthy film. Patrick Wilson is made for this role. He has a creepy edge that keeps him from being the perfect nice leading man. There is no other Kate Winslet. If anything, she's too beautiful to be the frumpy housewife role. She's luminescent. The role fits more for somebody like Jane Adams. Speaking of Jane Adams, her scene with Jackie Earle Haley is supremely horrific. Jackie gets a well-deserved comeback. My biggest issue is the narration. It gives it a literary feel coming from the novel written by Tom Perrotta. It keeps the story at a distance from the audience. There is less immediacy. It feels fictional. Some may like this way more but I found the narration a little annoying.",Little Children
1,claudio_carvalho,The Future Can Be a Different Story,8,8 January 2008,"In the suburbs, the boredom Sarah Pierce (Kate Winslet) lives a dull marriage without love with her selfish husband Richard Pierce (Gregg Edelman), who is successful in his career but with awful sexual habits. She spends the mornings with her daughter Lucy (Sadie Goldstein) in the playground observing the behavior of the suburban mothers with their children. When Sarah sees the frisson caused by the handsome ""househusband"" Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson) in the other women, she decides to talk to him. Brad tells her that he has failed twice in the Bar exams for lawyer and he is financially supported by his wife Kathy (Jennifer Connelly), who is a documentary filmmaker. He omits that Kathy is a woman that gives all her attention to their son Aaron (Ty Simpkins), refusing to have sex with him. Sarah feels trapped in her unhappy life and has an affair with Brad, who is the opposite of Richard, in the afternoons. Meanwhile, the pervert Ronnie J. McGorvey (Jackie Earle Haley), who was in prison for indecent exposure, returns to his mother's house and feels the prejudice of his community against his presence, especially from the retired policeman Larry Hedges (Noah Emmerich) that is trying to force Ronnie to move away from their neighborhood.""Little Children"" is an extremely well-acted movie that uses a modern adaptation of Madame Bovary to the present days in the American suburbs. The boredom condition of Emma Bovary and Sarah Pierce are very similar, both fell trapped in an unhappy marriage, and have love affairs to escape from their boredom. This movie really deserved the nomination to the Oscar in the categories of Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role, with Jackie Earle Haley having a top-notch performance in the role of a deranged sick man; Best Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role to the stunning Kate Winslet, one my favorite and best actress ever  my only remark is that, at least for my eyes and taste, she is a charming and beautiful woman, and apparently Sarah Pierce is a plain woman; and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, to Todd Field and Tom Perrotta that were able to perfectly develop a complex story with entwined lives of many characters in an adequate pace and eroticism. In the end, ""Little Children"" is one of those unforgettable and highly recommended movies. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Pecados Íntimos"" (""Intimate Sins"")",Little Children
2,lee_eisenberg,living in the suburbs would be death,10,24 June 2017,"Todd Field had been an actor for many years. He appeared as a crooner in Woody Allen's ""Radio Days"" and as a college buddy of Tom Cruise's character in Stanley Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut"". He made his feature debut as a director with 2001's ""In the Bedroom"", in which a tragedy exposes the flaws in a couple's marriage. His next movie was 2006's ""Little Children"", about some unpleasant things going on behind the veneer of a perfect suburban life.The movie has a couple of stories going on, each loosely connected: an extramarital affair between a bored housewife (Kate Winslet) and a man (Patrick Wilson) known as a prom king, the arrival of a sex offender (Jackie Earle Haley), and a former cop (Noah Emmerich) who keeps trying to hide an ugly past. All described by an omniscient narrator.There aren't really any good guys or bad guys. There are simply people who do morally questionable things in a amoral setting. Lawrence Ferlinghetti once called suburbs something like ""America's tragedy"", and that's perfectly apparent here. Winslet's character's friends - if you can call them friends - are the most empty-headed people of all, while Wilson's character's wife (Jennifer Connelly) is hard-working but barely has any relationship with anyone, including her husband.One could make the argument that suburban Gothic is an overused genre. That might be the truth. Even so I recommend ""Little Children"". The movie makes clear why the characters do what they do. Basically, they're sick people who nonetheless have some good in them. In a way, Haley's character is the most sympathetic in the movie (even though he did one of the most unethical things).I recommend it.",Little Children
3,rmax304823,Parental Guidance Recommended,8,9 December 2007,"James Joyce once advised us to ""wipe your glosses with what you know."" There aren't many Giant Novelists around anymore because we don't seem to have enough of the right kind of majestic stresses that produce the urge to capture and explain them. No more Great Depressions, World Wars, that sort of thing, so no more ""From Here to Eternity"" or ""The Grapes of Wrath"". Nowadays we wonder about whether to buy that SUV with the 20 mm. cannon on top, or to put the moves on that guy's wife we met at the community swimming pool.That's what most of us know and it's come to be a genre of its own, suburban literature, with its own emblems like John Cheever and John Updike. I suppose this movie sticks pretty closely to the novel it's based on, and it comes out just about right. It's about the kinds of people we know doing the kinds of things we know about. Or at least many of us know -- I never led a life even remotely resembling that of these characters -- but we can still find the life styles familiar.There's a distant, self-satisfied husband who we see having cybersex with an internet figure called something like Curious Kathy. Eventually, in a hilarious scene, the guy wants MORE, as always happens, buys a pair of sexy panties, imagines that they belong to Curious Kathy, and is discovered behind the closed door of his office with the panties half drawn over his head, masturbating wildly while goggling at photos of Curious Kathy on the internet. ""We'll talk later,"" says his wife (Kate Winslet), closing the door.There's the guy (Patrick Wilson) who is pretty straight, staying at home and taking care of the kids and pretending he's studying for the bar exam, who has the gorgeous wife, the self-absorbed wife (Jennifer Connelly), who is possessive without passion. When he takes a shower, hoping that he'll be able to have sex with her tonight, she whispers that she doesn't want to disturb the child sleeping comfortably in the middle of the bed. Then it's, ""Goodnight,"" and -- click, off goes the lamp.Then there's the really sick guy, Ronnie McGorvey, recently released from jail for child molestation, living at his mother's home, who is hated by everyone in West Wyndam, Massachussetts, and wakes to find his front door plastered with his mug shots and EVIL spray painted on his cement walkway. When he goes snorkeling in the community pool the other users begin to shriek and pull their children hysterically to safety until the cops come. It's as if the shark from ""Jaws"" had been dumped into the water. And Ronnie doesn't even seem ashamed as the police guide him out. He seems irritated. ""You'll do better if you find a girl nearer your own age,"" his mother advises him. ""But I don't like girls nearer my own age,"" he explains, reasonably enough.There isn't the space to go into these characters in any detail, or the stories either. They add up to a kind of mosaic of incidents, with Brad the someday-lawyer making it with Sarah the neglected wife, and things get rather tumultuous for a place like West Wyndam towards the end. There's a matter-of-fact narrative to help us along (by Will Lyman, whose voice you'll recognize) but it's not really of much help. That mellow exposition might as well be telling us about the reproductive habits of clams. In fact, I think maybe it has.The film cleanly blends intelligence, detailed observation, tragedy, and ironic humor. At the dinner table, with Kate Winslet as a guest, Jennifer Connelly intuits that her husband is doing to Kate exactly what he has been doing to Kate. The narration tells us so, and it tells us that Connelly pretends to drop a fork so that she can peek under the table and see if her husband is playing footsies with Winslet. Connelly seems to get lost under the table and we're in comic territory. I will mention one scene that especially impressed me because it was so unexpected. Mom arranges for the queer-looking pervert, Ronnie, to have a date. They're at a restaurant and she's not bad looking either, just sort of withdrawn, shy, and she's not eating. She explains that she's had two nervous breakdowns and is currently on medication. Ronnie, expressionless, listens to her and remarks, ""Well, that's not so bad."" She drives him home that night, shuts off the engine, and tells him how lonely she is and that she finds him to be a nice person. It takes a minute or two for her to get this out. Then she turns her head to see his response -- and Ronnie is sitting next to her in the darkness, his face twisted, masturbating as if the end of the world were around the corner, and he snarls back at her, ""You'd better not tell on me. You'd better not tell on me or I'll ******* get you!"" She dissolves in tears. Ronnie gets out and walks away without another word. It's a powerful scene. One of the reasons it's so powerful is that the entire encounter, previous to this point, has been a set up for a heart-warming ending, of the sort found in Ron Howard's movies. Two slightly bent people finding each other at last. Assortative mating, you know? ""Marty"" in suburbia. Instead, it turns out the way real life so often does -- lousy.",Little Children
4,moonspinner55,Unsympathetic portrait of small town lives which never quite achieves its contradictory ambitions,6,12 July 2010,"Another fascinating, flawed film by writer-producer-director Todd Field, who co-adapted the screenplay with Tom Perrotta from Perrotta's novel. Handsome stay-at-home dad in a stifling suburb, slowly and quietly being emasculated by his documentary-filmmaker spouse, has an affair with an unfulfilled housewife in the neighborhood; meanwhile, a sex-offender recently paroled has moved into town and is being harassed by an ex-policeman, who has his own tragic history. An occasionally effective tapestry of dramatic storytelling, yet one waits in vain for big, revealing scenes that never arrive. An even headier problem may be that this particular group of troubled (and selfish) people are never made embraceable to the audience...are any of these characters worth caring about? Field intertwines the smaller bits of the plot--the minutiae--together successfully, but he is unable to chart a satisfying course through the culmination of events, thereby reaching an unrewarding conclusion. There are rich, intuitive moments and performances, but the film derails at a crucial point in the story--with about 10 minutes left on the clock--and this leaves the audience feeling somewhat emotionally deprived. **1/2 from ****",Little Children
5,Quinoa1984,Field proves himself to be a veritable force of importance in the drama genre,10,1 January 2007,"Maybe I'm a sucker for this kind of arena of drama, dealing with adulteries and infidelities, or at least when then they're done with a level of believability that doesn't cross into soap operas. But going into Little Children, that's really all I expected to see. I got that, but I also got more than I would've hoped for: Little Children is one of the best examples in American movies of the dysfunctional suburban complacency and need for escapism since American Beauty (if not, perhaps, the most accomplished in dealing with fractured characters). The 'little children' of the title include a married man, Brad, and a married woman, Sara (not married to each other of course, played by Patrick Wilson and Kate Winslet), an ex-cop turned 'community-action' watchman (Noah Emmerich), and a sex offender/flasher (Jackie Earle Haley). Their lives become undone by nothing except from themselves, or each other, and never do the characters seem unrealistic or detached via melodrama. Field has a real knack here- and continues it from his breakthrough In the Bedroom- of cutting to the core of suburban discontent in the characters, though this time it's showing through (major) flaws and all, these are fully realized human beings who can't be turned away as mere clichés.The 'little children' of the story aren't the actual offspring of Winslet with her husband (a sometimes obsessor over wacky internet porno), and Wilson with his wife (Jennifer Connely, whom Brad describes after some prodding by Sara as a ""knockout"", even though he says beauty is ""overrated""). They're the adults- supposedly- who meet at the local playground in the park, where the other women always gather with their kids, a part of life that leaves Sara always in a funk. Only when the ""prom king"", as he's dubbed, arrives is there some interest that perks up from the usual doldrums of suburban malaise. On a bet Sara goes over to talk to him, the only one of the women to do so, and when she tells him quietly that they call him the 'prom king', she shares a kiss and hug (the latter unintentionally). Soon neither one can stop thinking about the other, they become closer as they meet everyday at the local swimming pool with their kids, and when they escape from a storm into her home one day and he finds a poetry book with his photo in there, the passion erupts completely.Meanwhile as their affair becomes all that really fulfills them everyday, there's a sub-plot involving a 'flasher', Ronnie, who in one of the very best scenes of the film in a mix of comedy and chilling tension, comes to the pool (after already being warned by the community for flashing himself in front of the kids at the playground), and when he's recognized as the face on all of those fliers all around town the pool empties out like the beach in Jaws. It would be one thing if this was all that was covered with the character, but his story is developed as well: his attachment to his mother (Phyllis Sommerville), and an ill-fated date with someone nearly socially awkward as him. His fate, as well as his mother, becomes in the target of Larry (Emmerich), who finds it to be his duty to stop this pervert of society, even though he himself has a dark past. As the stories of Sara, Brad, and Ronnie come to a head, one sees the formations of Brad as becoming the ""bad boy"" and Ronnie wanting to be the ""good boy"", one can see what might happen, or rather what should happen, and all the while conventions are perfectly cast aside.So much is risky in dealing with the material in Little Children, and Field takes on the risks with the tact of the smartest dramatists. Even with the difficult choice of a narrator- a third person narrator- seems to not work, at first, and then once the stories unfold it actually works more and more to divulge the smallest details that are actually needed (lifted right from the novel, certainly, but without them holes would be left open). Also fascinating is Field's bravery in two things, not making the characters too sympathetic, but also not making them into simplistic figures caught in the wheels of the script. Ronnie especially is a tricky character to pull off, but Field trusts the audience, and also trusts Haley (in an outstanding performance) to convey the complex nature of his sides of meaning well and just being a sexual deviant without compromise (same with Larry, however on a somewhat different level). And the story of infidelity is full of nuance and psychological danger: Brad and Sara practically consider their liaison as a 'game', no matter if the signs come up to Connelly's Kathy (the dinner scene with the two couples, a tremendously acted bit from all involved), yet it's all escapism in the guise of fear of the dead-end that are the parts of their lives that are dreary and crushing to their spirits. All the while Wilson and especially Winslet never break from their characters's souls, and for the latter I would imagine that in a perfect Oscar world she could get the award.By the end, even in little bits as a writer myself I might have passed by or lessened, I knew I had seen a real gem of a truly American drama. American, I mean, by it displaying figures that could only come out of that part of American life where mothers/wives and fathers/husbands without direction fold into dissatisfaction of that ""something"" missing, be it Brad watching the skateboarders or Sara with her unused English degree (err, Madame Bovary connection), and the bittersweet possibilities of escape and something better becomes overwhelming (and, if you're Ronnie, there almost is no escape, which makes his plight all the more heart-wrenching).",Little Children
6,edwagreen,People Who Live in Glass Houses...Little Children ***,7,20 May 2007,"People who live in glass houses should not throw stones. This is essentially the theme of this absorbing film.The town obviously looks at dismay at a convicted child molester who has been released. This is well shown at the pool scene when parents rush to get their children out when the molester (an engaging Jackie Earle Haley) jumps in.However, those who condemn him had better look into their own poor excuses for their lives. A couple is carrying on an illicit affair, and a guy who is the major leader against the molester is a former police officer who killed a child by accident years before and whose actions lead to another tragedy in the film.This is also a story of immaturity and frustration at its worst. A man who will not buy a cell phone, wastes all summer in not studying for the bar exam, an exam he has already failed twice, and begins the affair.The acting is quite good. As a woman who never wrote her dissertation to obtain her Ph.D in literature, Kate Winslet received her 5th Oscar nomination. In the role of the molester, Haley is memorable and was up for best supporting actor this past year.The common denominator in this film is the lack of immaturity of all the main characters and life's phoniness. The scene where Winslet discusses Madame Bovary is so good as while she discusses it, the film shows her love scenes with her new lover.This is an interesting film. The writers may have been attempting to show so much insofar as the love affair, child molesters and redemption. The scene where the former police officer tries to help the guy whose mother has died as a result of the officer's obnoxious behavior reminds me of the film ""Crash"" where redemption is attempted after a negative event has occurred.",Little Children
7,wes-connors,The Porcelain Menagerie,8,18 December 2012,"The tranquil suburban town of East Wyndam, Massachusetts is rocked by the release of a convicted sex offender. At the Walker Street Playground, mothers watch their children play with trepidation. Most residents think ""the pervert"" should be castrated, but bored housewife Kate Winslet (as Sarah Pierce) disagrees. She is not a typical suburban woman. Heads turns when handsome, well-built Patrick Wilson (as Brad Adamson) arrives at the playground with his little son. The women turn school-girlish and bet Ms. Winslet she can't get Mr. Wilson's telephone number. Eventually, she gets more than his number...The action moves from the playground to the town's pool, where things heat up considerably. We learn sex offender Jackie Earle Haley (as Ronald ""Ronnie"" James McGorvey) was found guilty of exposing himself. He visits the public pool to cool off, and is treated like the killer shark from ""Jaws"". The Committee for Concerned Parents is run by Wilson's after hours football buddy Noah Emmerich (as Larry Hedges). Retired from the police force for accidentally killing a kid, Mr. Emmerich wants ""the pervert"" publicly humiliated and run out of town. Most folks agree with Emmerich...""Little Children"" features stellar acting by Winslet, Wilson, Haley and Emmerich. There were several ""Supporting Actor"" awards for Haley and ""Best Actress"" nominations for Winslet. Shining in lesser roles are Wilson's hard-working wife Jennifer Connelly (as Katherine ""Kathy"" Adamson), Haley's over-protective mom Phyllis Somerville (as May McGorvey) and Winslet's porn-addicted husband Gregg Edelman (as Richard Pierce). No doubt they would all thank director Todd Field, creating magical roles with original writer Tom Perrotta. Alas, the film would be more powerful sans narration.******** Little Children (9/1/06) Todd Field ~ Kate Winslet, Patrick Wilson, Jackie Earle Haley, Noah Emmerich",Little Children

9,sunwarrior13,All About People's Vulnerabilities And Weaknesses,10,11 October 2011,"Little Children is a dramatic film that is based on the novel of the same name by Tom Perrotta. It stars Kate Winslet, Patrick Wilson, Jennifer Connelly, Jackie Earle Haley, Noah Emmerich, Gregg Edelman, Phyllis Somerville and Will Lyman.Todd Field,who co-wrote the screenplay with the novelist Perrotta,directs this film.The film involves the lives of two spouses from separate marriages, a registered sex offender, and a disgraced ex-police officer.Sarah Pierce (Winslet) is a reluctant housewife and mother in an upper-middle class suburb of Boston. She is married to Richard Pierce(Edelman),a successful yet distant husband, who is secretly obsessed with an internet porn star. While Brad Adamson (Wilson) is a former college football player who's married to Kathy (Connelly),a filmmaker, with a young son named Aaron. He is depressed and frustrated, as his wife is the breadwinner and he is a stay-at-home father.Each day he leaves home with the pretense of going to the library to study, but spends the time watching skateboarders at the nearby park. He joins a policeman's touch football team at the urging of a friend, Larry Hedges(Emmerich), a disgraced former police officer.Sarah and Brad meet on the school playground. Over the course of several visits to the local pool, both soon begin an affair. Finally,Ronnie James McGorvey (Haley), who has served a prison sentence for indecent exposure to a minor, has moved back into the neighborhood to live with his mother. Hedges launches a harassment campaign against Ronnie, handing out posters, vandalizing his house, harassing and almost assaulting the man and his mother. Over the course of the film,it explores the characters' struggle to resist their vulnerabilities and temptations to their weaknesses.This is one of the best films during the year of its release.The stories that are presented in this film are thought-provoking as it genuinely explores people's emotions,relationships and their insecurities in life.The themes tackled will definitely go through the sensitivity and emotions of the viewer. The acting was definitely superior in this film.After an absence of 13 years in the film industry,come backing actor,Jackie Earle Haley shines in this film together with Kate Winslet. Both deserved their Oscar nominations for this film. Finally,the screenplay and the direction of the film deserves a lot of praise as well.In summary,it is one of the best films that truly wonders about the mystery of human emotions.",Little Children
10,preppy-3,Somewhat predictable but still very good if disturbing,8,6 August 2010,"Two unhappily married people--Sarah Pierce (Kate Winslet) and Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson)--start having an affair. Also involved in this is a pedophile (Jackie Earle Haley) who was just released from jail and is living in the neighborhood with a vindictive ex-cop (Noah Emmerich) after him. Their lives all intersect and it all comes to a head on a dark night. The ending is both hopeful and horrifying.There's nothing really new here that I haven't seen before but it's all very well-done. There is an off screen narrator which seems strange at first but he explains things to us that help move the story along. This is over two hours and moves at a slow pace but it is needed to understand the characters and situations. Still things were pretty obviously cut from the final print. A whole subplot with Sarah's husband is bought up and then dumped completely. It's well-directed in a leisurely fashion that fits the tone of the film. In fact the first sex scene between Wilson and Winslet is explicit and funny but doesn't seem at all disturbing! The acting is excellent all around. Wilson, Winslet, Haley and Emmerich are all superb in their roles. Haley actually makes you feel sympathetic for his character Winslet and Haley were nominated for Academy Awards for their performances but the entire cast works on the same level. As I said some of the endings were predictable, but one ending I didn't see coming and it's downright shocking. A depressing but extremely well-done film. Worth catching.",Little Children
11,Bunuel1976,"LITTLE CHILDREN (Todd Field, 2006) ***",7,15 July 2007,"I had watched  and been sufficiently impressed with  this director's acclaimed previous film, IN THE BEDROOM (2001); the follow-up effort proves to be altogether more accomplished. Again, we're treated to a variety of suburban neuroses  which I can't help feeling some of the characters bring upon themselves (more on this later).Anyway, the director has the temerity to stretch the melodramatic proceedings  essentially revolving around three interweaving plot threads  to a hefty 137 minutes. That it doesn't collapse under its own weight is due to a perceptive script (compounded by pointed narration) and excellent performances; the actors generally manage to steer clear of hysterics (which only really come into play towards the end). Both the talent and beauty of leading ladies Kate Winslet and Jennifer Connelly is on display here  though the latter's role is rather small and colorless. I'm not familiar with either of the actors playing their characters' respective husbands  in this case, it's Winslet's husband who fares the worst (as he's inexplicably absent throughout most of the film, except when the director needs to harp on his particular mania!). Jackie Earle Haley is effectively understated in a difficult role as a convicted paedophile; he obviously incurs the wrath of the neighborhood which is full of kids  and is hounded by an ex-security officer who, as it happens, had been disgraced himself after accidentally shooting and killing a child! As I said, the director makes it hard for the audience to empathize with anyone (despite paralleling Winslet's character with one of the most famous tragic heroines of literature, Madame Bovary) because the people concerned can hardly help themselves. The two couples don't really do anything to save their respective marriage but, in the end, the straying partners  no doubt burdened by the presence of a child in each of their lives  seem uncommitted towards taking that decisive step to freedom. Connelly and her husband manage to remain together after a stupid skateboarding accident, but things seem less certain in Winslet's vapid household. As for Haley, every time he manages to move us by his predicament (a combination of 'sensitive soul' and 'mama's boy') is then offset by some needlessly punishing exhibition  the incident at the pool, the way he ruins his one chance at a date, and the inevitable final act.Well-made and acted, therefore, but essentially contrived  and, like the director's previous outing, the film doesn't lend itself easily to rewatchability in view of its subject matter (not so much the controversial issues as the soap-opera elements) and considerable length...",Little Children
12,lastliberal,"He should just be castrated. Just snip, quick and easy.",10,27 May 2007,"Todd Field (Eyes Wide Shut) presents a slice of life in suburbia that is both fascinating and sad.This is the first time that I have watched a movie where a narrator (Will Lyman) provided hints as to what was going on. It worked beautifully as I felt that I was watching an anthropological study on suburban life, much as watching gorillas in the jungle.In our study we see: a trio of suburban wives that thought they were special and shunned outsiders; a wife (Kate Winslet) that was disconnected from her husband (Gregg Edelman), who spent his time on porn sites with panties over his head; an immature husband (Patrick Wilson) that had a wife (Jennifer Connelly) that was married to her work and her child; and, to make things really interesting, the conflict between a disgraced cop and a newly released sexual predator (Jackie Earle Haley).It was touching, bizarre, amusing, and aggravating. It was just what makes a movie that you want to watch over and over to see what else is in there.Winslet was absolutely magnificent, and Haley was perfectly cast.

13,george.schmidt,Careful What You Wish For: Complacency in Suburban Hell; Winslet & Haley -Oscar calibre turns,9,16 November 2006,"LITTLE CHILDREN (2006) ***1/2 Kate Winslet, Patrick Wilson, Jennifer Connelly, Gregg Edelman, Sadie Goldstein, Ty Simpkins, Noah Emmerich, Jackie Earle Haley, Phyllis Somerville, Raymond J. Barry, Helen Carey, Jane Adams, Trini Alvarado. (Dir: Todd Field)Careful What You Wish For: Complacency in Suburban HellSarah Pierce (Winslet in an Oscar worthy performance of intelligence and nuance), is an unhappy housewife who doesn't realize it until it is too late and in the form of a stay-at- home dad named Brad Adamson (Wilson in a solid turn), who too doesn't realize how his inner sadness is about to blossom into something he hadn't expected to harvest in the form of unbridled lust for Sarah, who he meets one day in the local park where the other snarky housewives go to let their children play. Sarah can see through the masks of complacency of her neighboring mothers and deep down resents being one, recognizing that she is a reasonably smart, literate and attractive woman who hungers for something, ANYTHING, in her dull life that she is sharing with her complicit husband Richard (Edelman), whose secret need for online porn is shockingly discovered one day by Sarah giving her license to enact her desires for ""The Prom King"" (as the nasty mothers have dubbed the good-looking Brad), and the two begin a seemingly warm yet intense affair. Brad's beautiful wife Kathy (Connellly), a free-lance documentary producer, is unknowing at first about the affair which only leads to more tension for Brad who cannot fathom why he is even cheating on her to begin with only knowing that he too craves for something  certainly not his third attempt in taking the bar exam for a career as a lawyer  and finds Sarah's forbidden fruit refreshingly satisfying to his unspoken needs.To add fuel to the fires a recently released pedophile has returned to the neighborhood prompting a parallel storyline involving a co-hort of Brad's, Larry Hedges (veteran character actor Emmerich in arguably his best role to date), a former cop who has a vendetta to make the ex-con's life a living hell by confronting him on many attempts to show a glaring spotlight on the evil infesting the environs.The evil is Ronald James McGorvey (played by one-time child star Haley in a truly amazing comeback nod and a surefire shot for Best Supporting Actor), a slight, balding and bantam weight compact man who lives with his loving elderly mother May (Somerville instilling some decency for the film's moral counters), and seems normal except for his disease of sexual gratification with minors. That is nothing to make light of nor am I suggesting it should be, but it shows that 'evil' is not all horns and capes with smoke but in the small figure of a ruined shell of a man; sympathy for the devil if you like.Based on Tom Perrotta's novel, director Field (who collaborated with the author on the screenplay) continues to impress in his tactile sure-handed methods that he displayed in his debut, ""In The Bedroom"", which showcased his ability to allow actors room to grow while containing tensions and dread for a showdown at the end with their characters. Again, here he excels and deserves an Academy Award nomination (as well as for the screenplay which is one of the year's absolutely best written). Winslet continues also to impress as the actress of her generation and ascending the mantle of contemporaries like Emma Thompson, her gifts are on full display and she makes Sarah such a well-rounded character inhibited with all the things that make one human: humor, desire, brains, emotion and namely, spirit. Wilson matches her step by step in arguably the more difficult roles of the two in the sense that he is blindly allowing his vanity get the best of him unwittingly; a truly loaded weapon just bound to go off. Connelly does the most with her slight part but her amazing eyes work to full affect when she begins to put two and two together giving the film some antsiness. Emmerich, who I admit is not one of my favorite actors usually is a load, but his disgraced lawman adds depth and underscores the themes perfectly and again not enough can be said for the sad, lonely and ultimately heart-breaking performance for comeback kid Haley in his pathetic, doomed character. The film works on the basic level of the old adage, be careful what you wish for; the same can be said for the movie itself.",Little Children
14,neil-476,"Yes it's art, but is it entertainment?",7,2 April 2013,"Mother and housewife Kate Winslet is discontented with her lot. At the playground she bumps into househusband Patrick Wilson (married to Jennifer Connelly), also discontented with his lot, and they start an affair. Also in the neighbourhood is Jackie Earle Hailey, released from prison for child sex offences (the film leaves it open as to whether he is actually a paedophile although he is clearly more than slightly mixed up on the sexual side). It seems unlikely to turn out well...And it's probably not giving too much away to say that it doesn't although, frustratingly, major elements of the movie are left open-ended. I suppose you can make up your own ending.This film features excellent performances (from, particularly, Connelly and Hailey) but, for me, it all remained sleazy and downbeat, not to mention unresolved. I don't mind tragedy every now and then, but I do like a bit of redemption to kick at somewhere around the ending: if you're not going to have that, at least do me the favour of telling me what happened.",Little Children
15,evanston_dad,A Highly Unusual and Exceptional Film,10,23 October 2006,"Can there be such a thing as a feel-good movie about marital infidelity and suburban ennui? If so, then I believe this haunting, powerful and superb new movie from Todd Field may be it.A feel-good movie was not in the least what I was expecting from this, based on the trailers and on Field's prior film, the astringent and depressing ""In the Bedroom."" And it's not like I left the theatre feeling the need to break into song. But unlike other films about the stultifying atmosphere of suburban America, and the prisons so many people seem to make out of their domestic worlds, ""Little Children"" ends with a distinct feeling of hope and optimism. In other domestic dramas, the characters are frequently unlikable, and they appear to drift through their worlds allowing things to happen to them without taking any responsibility for themselves. In ""Little Children,"" Field does not present us with a handful of caustic stereotypes, but rather with a cast of actors who create warm but flawed human beings. These characters don't drift through life. They have things they care about, and they want and feel that they deserve some of the small happinesses that all human beings have a right to. But they also screw up, make bad decisions, act irrationally. What saves them, and the movie, is that in the end they all wake up, realize they're chasing dreams, and decide to make something of the lives they have rather than the lives they think they want.I thought this was a hopeful message, and one that carries with it a tremendous impact in this post-9/11 culture, when the safety nets on which we've built our existences have been ripped out from under us and we're left trying to make sense of a scary world. This film, in its closing moments, states outright that there's no time like now to begin taking control of our own worlds and making of them what we want. The best weapon we can wield against an uncertain future are our children, who can learn from our mistakes and make something new rather than simply repeat an endless cycle. As for the acting.....Kate Winslet shines as Sarah, the suburban mom who doesn't fit in and embarks upon a reckless affair to fill a void in her days. Her performance is one of those small triumphs of acting, in which Winslet builds a living, breathing human being from the ground up through a series of subtle and thoughtful choices. Patrick Wilson, such a limp noodle in the screen version of ""The Phantom of the Opera,"" is pitch perfect as Brad, the stud who attracts Sarah's eye. And the other actors take full advantage of their smaller roles: Jennifer Connelly as Brad's loving but distracted wife; Jackie Earle Haley as the film's most tragic figure, Noah Emmerich as an ex-cop who takes homeland security into his own hands; and Phyllis Somerville, who has a couple of beautifully heart-breaking moments as the mom of an outcast.The screenplay is thematically elaborate. There's hardly an element of one character's storyline that doesn't find a parallel in the storyline of another. The theme of parenting is of course central, but beyond simply focusing on the responsibilities parents owe their children, the film goes deeper and examines how parents' behavior affects their children and the extent to which parents can change the world for good or bad through what they hand down to the children who inherit it.A bracing, fantastic film.Grade: A+",Little Children
16,ferguson-6,Be a Good Boy,8,28 October 2006,"Greetings again from the darkness. Where the heck have you been, Todd Field? Last seen directing 2001's excellent ""In The Bedroom"", Field delivers another remarkable drama with ""Little Children"". He proves again his insight into real people and real relationships is a bit eerie and almost tough to watch as we often recognize ourselves in his characters.An incredibly well acted movie led by the usually mediocre Kate Winslet and an on the rise Patrick Wilson (""The Alamo"", ""Hard Candy"" and this year's ""Running With Scissors""), the cast creates an atmosphere of real life allowing us to forget the performances and concentrate on the multi-layered story (co-written by Field and novelist Tom Berrotta). The genius in the film is in so many specific moments within the scenes. Jennifer Connelly (as Wilson's wife, and although still beautiful, she is scary skinny) at the dinner table when she realizes, Winslet as she is putting her daughter on the floorboard of the car, Wilson as he sneaks off the train, and the mothers at the swimming pool when they realize a predator has pierced their inner sanctum. That predator is Jackie Earle Haley who is just outstanding in his brutally tough role. Haley was seen earlier this year in ""All The King's Men"" and hopefully is experiencing a real comeback. Although he will always be remembered as the talented center fielder in ""Bad News Bears"", he definitely has more to offer.Really good dramatic stories are so rare these days. Movie makers tend to be frightened of the tough decisions we all face every day and they fall back on proved formulas and feel good fluff. This movie is real and tough and will force you to analyze your life and perspective. What a marvelous thing to be able to say about a film.So, yes I highly recommend the film, but more importantly implore Mr. Field to not leave us hanging for another 5 years. Film lovers need you!!",Little Children
17,Wuchakk,Quality adult drama with lots of dry humor,7,4 September 2014,"""Little Children"" (2006) is a well-done adult drama mixed with lots of dry humor. The story revolves around two suburban couples in Connecticut and people linked to them. Sarah (Kate Winslet) becomes increasingly intrigued by a local stay-at-home dad, Brad (Patrick Wilson), particularly when she catches her husband yielding to his base desires (in a particularly funny scene). It's a slow descent into hell, so to speak, as the situation leads to adultery and its typical consequences. There's also a subplot about a man just released from prison for exposing himself to a minor and the ex-cop who's obsessed with destroying him, but the latter has his own demons, which disqualifies him of his high horse.The film's called ""little children"" (presumeably taken from the Bible, e.g. 1 John) because the key adults are acting like little children in one way or another rather than responsible adults. The message of the film is simple: GROW UP. Or ""everyone grows older, but not everyone grows up."" Winslet shines here. ""Little Children"" was released nine years after her breakthrough in ""Titanic"" and she's just way more appealing as a woman -- a curvy whoa-man -- than as the teenager with baby fat (not that she wasn't attractive in ""Titanic,"" of course; just that mature women are always better than immature girls IMHO). Jennifer Connelly plays Kathy, the bread-winning wife of Brad, and I find it interesting that the movie goes out of its way to say that Kathy is a ""knockout"" while Sarah (Winslet) is kind of plain, short and with too-thick eyebrows. I guess ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder"" because, as pretty as Connelly may be (just too thin), I think Kate blows her out of the water with her voluptuousness.""Little Children"" is just a solid adult drama. It has some dialogue-driven (and body language-driven) slow parts, but it consistently maintains your attention and adequately shows that ordinary life and the glory & shame thereof is more compelling (and funny) than the most overwrought CGI-laden action-packed idiotic ""blockbuster"" (not that those types of films can't be effective, like the outstanding ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"").There's one brilliant scene that takes place at the dinner table where both couples finally spend time together. During the conversation Kathy picks up on her radar what's really going on between Brad and Sarah. It's subtle, but she clearly picks it up. The directing, writing and acting of this scene are all flawless -- masterful filmmaking.The ending could've been better, but the decisions two characters make show that maybe they're growing up after all; and I like that.The film runs 137 minutes and was shot in New England and New York.GRADE: B+",Little Children
18,gradyharp,In the Eyes and Minds of Little Children,10,3 May 2007,"LITTLE CHILDREN is one of the finest films of the past decade, a film that is intensely intelligent in concept, in writing, in acting, and in production values. It is rare to find a film so right in every aspect, dealing with aspects of living we'd all rather overlook while at the same time recognizing bits and pieces of ourselves and of those around us in manner that contributes to the frightening credibility of the story.Todd Field, so highly respected for his previous film 'In the Bedroom', directs the story from the novel by Tom Perrotta with whom he wrote the screenplay. It deals with the way children perceive the world, even when those children are of adult age. Thwarted Sarah (Kate Winslet) is bored with her life in a little town in Massachusetts where she lives a tepid life with her sexually absent husband Richard (Gregg Edelman) who prefers online porno to Sarah's needs. Sarah and her daughter Lucy spend the days at the park (with bitchy nosy boring fellow housewives and their children) and encounters the stay-at-home Dad, Brad (Patrick Wilson), called the 'Prom King' by the klatch. Sarah and Brad meet and a slow and smoldering 'affair' begins (Brad is married to the beautiful but distant Kathy (Jennifer Connelly): they are each seeking to fill the needs that they perceive have eluded them. Meanwhile the town is set on its ear by the return of convicted Ronnie (Jackie Earle Haley), released from jail for exposing himself to little children, and now living with his mother who is a strong mother and loves her son despite his past. The story is told to us by a narrator who unwinds the events like a channeler, showing how each of these disparate people come to realize that they are each acting with retarded, regressive emotional skills usually found only in children. And in the end of the story each has been forced to mature - or have they? The entire cast is brilliant as is the quality of direction by Field. The musical score and the hauntingly beautiful cinematography add to the pulsating rhythm of this exploration of the psyches of 21st century adults. It may be a difficult movie to watch for some, but it is a triumph of cinematic art. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp",Little Children
19,zetes,"Great setup, no payoff",7,8 January 2007,"An oddly toned film. I have been able to avoid the more intense discussions this has aroused, and I was barely at all aware that the film had comedic tones. As far as I can figure, the film posits suburban and married life in the realm of the Twilight Zone, via a deep-voiced, omniscient narrator. The narrator is something that most film audiences don't care for, but I don't think Field and novelist/screenwriter Tom Perrotta would have been able to capture the tone they did without it. So I personally thought that worked. I think the tone is really what makes the film memorable. The movie's steeped in awkwardness, but, at least for most of the film's run, it isn't awkward itself. The story begins well, and the characters are excellently realized and performed. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson play the primary caregivers to their toddler children. They grow closer as they meet repeatedly at playgrounds and the public swimming pool, and soon begin an affair. The film's major subplot deals with a recently released sex offender (played by Jackie Earle Haley) who is being hassled by a former police officer (Noah Emmerich). Haley's loving, elderly mother (Phyllis Somerville) tries desperately to protect her son. The main plot and the subplot tangle together in the end, and there is an attempt to relate the subplot to the main plot (as per screen writing 101), but it feels mighty forced. In fact, pretty much everything fizzles by the film's very weak ending. The strong story that had been built up, alas, has no satisfying resolution. I still think it's mostly a very strong film, though, with great direction by Field.",Little Children
20,deloudelouvain,Secret affairs and a pervert,8,10 May 2016,"When I saw it was a drama/romance I didn't have high expectations because that's normally not the kind of movies I go for. But it was quite the opposite of what I expected. It's a remarkable movie about two lovers, both married, having a secret affair while in the mean time the whole neighborhood is on alert because a known sex offender is living nearby. The whole cast did a great job with their respective roles. Kate Winslet as Sarah Pierce and Patrick Wilson as Brad Adamson are a delight to watch in their secret forbidden romance. The sex offender Ronnie J. McGorvey played by Jackie Earle Haley is by far one of the strongest actors in this movie. You kind of feel sorry for him sometimes, but then his weird and perverted nature surfaces and you immediately hate him again. Very well played if you ask me. The movie might be long but time just flies by when you're watching it. I was pleasantly surprised and can only recommend it to everybody.",Little Children
21,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Little Children,10,8 February 2007,"Welcome to suburbia!It took director Todd Field 5 years to come up with another movie after In the Bedroom, which I watched back in 2001. It's kinda strange that while at first glance I'd think his movies are a tad boring, in both occasions - for In the Bedroom and now Little Children, I ended up glued to the screen, and find myself sucked deeply into the proceedings. Somehow he managed to draw me into the story, feel for the characters, build up excellent tension all the way to the end, before releasing me from its grasp in the well thought finale.Things might not always be interesting, but Little Children offers a tight drama and excellent characterization. Based on a novel by Tom Perrotta who also co-wrote the screenplay with Todd Field, Little Children looked very much like Desperate Housewives in its introductory scenes, with the voice over narration, and well, housewives going about their daily routine of caring for their children, mindless idle chatter and gossips, and lusting over the ""prom king"", their fantasy hunk who's actually a house-husband (Patrick Wilson).That aside, it didn't take too long for the catalyst of a dare to spring things into motion, with Sarah (Kate Winslet) making bold contact with Brad (Wilson), much to the dislike of her peers. It's interesting to note that neighbourhood politics also rears its ugly head, with ostracizing of fellow neighbours for trespassing against you even for the most minute, or inane reasons. This movie captured such moments succinctly, and no doubt you could probably identify a moment of two, whether you're on the side that dishes out such negativeness, or are actually on the receiving end.The relationship between Sarah and Brad, which becomes a highly sexually charged one, takes on a life of its own as it threatens their respective holy matrimony. But it's curious that you start to wonder if their dalliances could be justified in a warped sense of the way. Trapped in unhappy marriages with emotional zilch, it didn't seem that each of them will want to carry on making things work, instead opting for quick fixes with someone else, though it degenerates quickly to constant banging.It's a study into the lives of two families. Sarah and Richard Pierce (Gregg Edelman), who experience a total meltdown in their ties when he exhibits his infidelity and probable deviant relationship with Slutty Kay. And Brad and Kathy Adamson (Jennifer Connelly, totally hot, which states that there absolutely no logical reason why anyone would want to cheat on her), in their reversal of roles, financial issues and the former's lack of ambition, put a strain on their relationship, especially when Kathy isn't satisfying Brad's primal urges. Put two and two together, you see an immoral solution of revenge and an outlet for satisfaction, but two wrongs don't make a right. The respective spouses don't get much airtime (a pity for fans of Connelly), though they serve as ample backdrop that yes, our adulterous couple are cheats in their own ways too.The movie makes you judge and question the intent and actions of the adulterers, and it doesn't make it easy with no clear answers, much like real life. Weaved into the main plot, is a separate short, though it may seem to be the more powerful one. Convicted pedophile Ronnie (Jackie Earle Haley) is released back to society, much to the resentment of the community he lives in. At first glance, he looks harmless, and you wonder if it could be another case of Boo Radley. But as we go along, again you're subconsciously drawing conclusions, while at the same time, made to understand the plights of a man who can't control his strange urges. You will probably feel sorry, then angry, and flip flopping between empathy and disgust. And in this story arc, it demonstrates that mother's love is almost always unconditional. Don't expect something like The Woods, but perhaps something a little more, from Jackie Earle Hayley's excellent acting, and the material he has to work upon.There are other sub plots put in, which spices the movie up, like the Guardians touch- football that boys will always be boys, the one man crusade against Jackie, and a scene which sums up the feelings of Sarah at a book club reading, which I thought their discussions accurately paralleled the emotions of what Sarah's going through at the moment. One thing to note is that the editing is seamless and smooth, which transitions between scenes almost flawlessly, though you can't help but to notice it. The movie might seem to go on and on, and somehow I almost wished that it wouldn't end (seriously), but it built up to a tension filled conclusion and ended with what I think was a nice resolution to almost all the issues presented, though not all perfectly, or in the way it should be.But that's life, and life goes on.

22,Smells_Like_Cheese,A beautiful American film,9,4 May 2007,"The main reason why I wanted to check this movie out was because this was the film that Kate Winslet was nominated for once again by the Oscars, and I have to say from the film clip, this movie looked incredibly interesting. I was excited when I saw this movie for rent and grabbed it right away, I just watched it today and I have to say that while in some ways it was a disturbing story, it was also very touching in a lot of ways. I felt like I had been captured into the book, these characters had such depth and character, you felt for all of them in such ways, either you could relate or want to speak too and have some sort of relationship with.Sarah is a housewife and a mother who has lost a little something in her life, passion, while her husband is messing around on the internet, she meets the ""prom king"" of the block, Brad, and has a deep passionate affair with him. But there is a problem, Brad is also married with a child as well, but their affair and love is too strong to ignore when they realize that they are what were missing in each other's lives, or are they just a fantasy they needed to fulfill? There is another character in this film named Ronnie, who had a horrible reputation after exposing himself to a minor and is snubbed by the committee, but the only love of his life is his mother who is constantly trying to get an ex cop harasser off her son's back.Little Children is an incredibly touching film, the ending was so beautiful and really brought true closure to the story. The acting was just superb, Kate and Patrick worked so incredibly well together and had hot chemistry. Also, Jackie as Ronnie, his character was so heart breaking, it was just so disturbing to watch him go through his journey of trying to be a good boy for his mommy. This was a fantastic film, one of the best American films of our time, I would highly recommend it.9/10",Little Children
23,blanbrn,"Compelling and interesting look at the dark side of human nature, it shows how different attitudes and personalities intersect in the suburbs.",6,22 May 2009,"Just watched ""Little Children"" and I must say that clearly this was one of the better and more underrated films of 2006. It's focus and setting is in the suburbs, and it's themes I should say center around characters who have problems some are dark, yet many traits are hidden and exposed as the film goes along. In some sense you may feel like your watching something similar to ""American Beauty"" or a big screen film of TV's ""Desperate Housewives"".Todd Field who went rounds as both director and writer paints a haunting tale of life in the suburbs as it shows all have hidden secrets and different personalities intersect. It was interesting how the themes of bringing an ex child molester back into a community blended in with a marital affair, lust and sexual deviance. One of the best actresses around Kate Winslet stars as Sarah a married but, lonely woman who devotes all of her time to her studies as being an educated woman she studies groups and social patterns and life trends. Sarah just wants a little passion yet her husband is a masturbating online freak who has turned the cold shoulder to her.Enter Brad(Patrick Wilson) the hunk of the community who's a water cooler and book club discussion topic with all of the ladies of the town. Brad is still trying to pass the bar exam to become a lawyer, yet he's dominated and watched careful both professionally and money wise by his wife Kathy(Jennifer Connelly)a documentary filmmaker. Yet one day to everyone's surprise both Sarah and Brad meet and hit it off right away. Slowly and surely a hot and passionate romantic affair of sex and lust develops which was great escape for both. And even though as a viewer you feel the escapism and erotic nature still you are drawn to the wild card of the film the return of Ronnie(Jackie Earle Haley)a child molester who's returned to society. And the film portrays him as so odd and one to fear as you see evidenced by the pool scene. As clearly this character is used as an allegory to show fear.This film was made to show how typical life has become in the suburbs and it shows how the different personalities mesh and mix and it's clear a lot of human nature is dark. Yet most of all it proves no matter how different our paths our lives intersect and lead to surprising discoveries and even tragic ends.",Little Children
24,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Dark and quietly disturbing tale of suburban unease,9,20 March 2007,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Sarah (Kate Winslet) lives in her Massachusetts home and spends her days as a wife to a businessman who visits explicit porno sites to fulfil his fantasies, raising her young daughter and trying to keep a friendship with three other suburban housewives who she's just not on a level with. These women dare her to approach Brad (Patrick Wilson) a handsome stranger with a young son in tow and get his phone number. But they get closer than expected and begin a passionate affair behind their partners backs. These same women also have some consternation in the shape of Ronnie (Jackie Earle Haley) a convicted sex offender living in their midst. However by the end of the movie the lives of these three will collide together in a way they never imagined.I'd originally seen this advertised on the Black Dahlia DVD I rented. It had the look of a taut psychological thriller about it, but I discovered it was more of a drama type film. It still interested me and I was quite glad I had seen it. The film still manages a tense and intriguing atmosphere through-out, and never lets up on the dark and grimy feel of the lives of the characters the film is portraying. Strong performances keep it going, but the strength of the characters is what really makes the film so engrossing.The film's trying to be clever, using a format that's been used before by telling multiple stories and having them all collide together at the end. This rests uneasily with the film's deeper psychological angle trying to get beneath the character's surface and it gets a bit too lost in the drama aspect which meanders on aimlessly, making it a bit boring by the end. The Bill Cosby style voice-overs also feel a trifle misplaced. But it's still a rewarding and fulfilling film that you'll come away pleased with. ****",Little Children
25,bowmanblue,Wonderful movie,9,19 May 2014,"I can't believe I have only just watched this. And, to make matters worse, I very nearly turned it off after about a quarter of an hour. The film is about two couples, both trapped in their own loveless marriages.From the start we get some form of 'narration' from a character never seen in the film. I found this kind of off-putting at first as it tells you what characters are thinking and I thought it was a lazy way at skipping through finding things out about characters as a view. However, this narration basically disappears more and more as the film progresses and, in my opinion, is the right thing to do.The film is long - just over two hours and it gets better and better. Everyone's performance is brilliant and there's little negative to say about it.If you're into adult drama about relationships that are very bittersweet, then this one is for you.Although, be warned, a happy-happy, feel-good movie this is not.Too much like real life.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Little Children
26,secondtake,"A layered, interwoven story of ordinary people doing extraordinary things. Great stuff.",9,17 April 2010,"Little Children (2006)This is such a stunning interweaving of significant every day problems among a half dozen characters, you can watch it more than once. Even though you know what's going to happen the second time. I'm on my third viewing, and Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson make such unlikely, perfect chemistry as ordinary suburban parents I'm on their side every time.The problem is they are married to other people, not each other. And there is a child molester in town. And the media-fed fears of average people in very nice houses on quiet streets. It's the most common of settings, and if the stereotypes that get set up seem extreme, you'll see that that's part of the style, and that what you think might happen doesn't quite, never quite. The path of the child molester is not followed for most of the film, and eventually becomes equal to the other main plot, the relationship between two lonely people. By the end you see small victories by every character amidst disasters. It's not a feel good movie, but you'll feel good by the closing scenes.I went to a screening of Little Children two years ago where the author of the book, Tom Perrotta (who also co-wrote and screenplay and won an Oscar for his efforts). He pointed out how fascinating the whole process was, as a novelist, seeing the machinery of the industry take his story and run with it. And he said the final sensational event with the child molester wasn't in the book. It wasn't clear he liked the change, but he also had shrugged his shoulders long before about having much power to change it. Or that's how I remember it.Anyway, this is a sleeper classic, very well made, well shot, beautifully paced, rarely drawn out. It is sometimes stylized in a diversionary way--the football game in particular--but I took this as a time to rest from all the more subtle melodrama going on elsewhere. The exaggerated patter and comic reactions of the three women who open the movie was offputting a little for me, because it made it seem it was all a little silly and even poorly written. But you come to see this also as an intended affectation, balancing against the very high realism and dramatic truths of the best parts of the movie.",Little Children

Wilson, a relatively new actor, does well, as do Emmerich as a troubled ex-cop and Haley in the difficult role of a child molester.

They start an affair while a registered sex offender is released and live close to them, and a disgraced ex-police officer tries to be patient about the whole issue.I was really surprised by this movie because it was very interesting, with plenty of dramatic moments and some very good interpretations made by its cast. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, both Kate Winslet who played as Sarah Pierce and Patrick Wilson who played as Brad Adamson were very good and I believe their interpretations made the difference in this movie. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Jennifer Connelly's who played as Kathy Adamson, Noah Emmerich's who played as Larry Hedges and Jackie Earle Haley's who played as Ronnie J.

29,zkonedog,Too Much Here To Make Much Sense Of,5,4 September 2018,"The reason I was interested in this film is because its screenplay was partially written Tom Perrotta, who wrote the book ""The Leftovers"" that was later adapted into perhaps my favorite TV show of all-time. While I could definitely see his style all over ""Little Children"", it seems as if perhaps the rest of the production didn't quite understand what that style is all about.For a basic plot summary, this flick focuses on suburban life. Sarah (Kate Winslet) doesn't fit in with the judgmental park-mommies, despite being married with a child herself, so she is drawn to a relationship with ""Prom King"" Brad (Patrick Wilson). Brad, of course, is married to his own wife Kathy (Jennifer Connelly). All the while, a pedophile (played by Jackie Earle Haley) moves in right down the block, which riles up neighborhood watchdog Larry (Noah Emmerich).The easy way to describe this movie would be the deep suburban-life themes of ""American Beauty"" done in the style of ""Crazy, Stupid, Love"". The whole concept is deep emotional themes presented in almost sort of a madcap style. Even in the best of scenarios, this would be a tricky concept to pull off, and it doesn't work all that well here, either.The major problem, however, seems to be director Todd Field potentially not understanding how to handle the material. There are indeed gems of emotion and interesting thought-pieces in this film (why I can't give it less than 5 stars), but the way in which it is presented robs the whole piece of those potent possibilities. With ""The Leftovers"", Perrotta's material was interpreted by one of the greatest screenwriters of the modern era in Damon Lindelof. ""Little Children"" doesn't nearly get that sort of treatment.Overall, I have to say I was disappointed with this film. I didn't have huge expectations going in, but character drama (especially in suburbia) is a favorite of mine, and this one tried by patience over its nearly two hours and twenty minute runtime. There's good material here, to be sure, but you really have to dig deep to find it, and it ends up not being all that worthwhile in the end.",Little Children
30,eddie_baggins,A classic study of suburban and married life,9,29 January 2018,"Shining a light on both suburban life and the trial's of one being faithful to their spouses in a world were temptation lay in wait behind every corner, Todd Field's confronting and brilliantly realised Blue Velvet like look at the lives of some very flawed human beings is a strong and powerful today as it was upon release in 2006.Nominated for 3 Academy Awards including nominations for two if its stars Kate Winslet and the unforgettable Jackie Earle Haley as the films vilified and mentally unstable Ronnie, Field's film is one of those rare drama's where every single actor is on the top of their game with Winslet, Haley and in particular the often disappointing Patrick Wilson delivering what all could well be career best turns in their respective roles.A large portion of Little Children's screentime is dedicated to the budding friendship/affair that starts up between Winslet's frustrated and angry housewife Sarah and Wilson's meandering stay at home dad Brad, as the two find solace in one another as their stalled lives come to a head and their community is overtaken with concern and outrage over the recent arrival of Haley's convicted criminal to their normally quiet and unassuming suburb.Adapted for the screen alongside Little Children's novelist Tom Perrotta, Field's wastes no line of dialogue or no scene in his 130 minute expose of the ever present battle to be content and the desire to be loved and to love and it's not often film character's feel so alive and real as they do here in this film.Winslet's Sarah is an intellectually smart and dedicated mother battling with a husband whose far from loyal in his own right, Wilson's lost soul like Brad has the trophy wife and beloved son but is seemingly lost with where he wants to get to in his life while Haley's Ronnie is an initially repulsive figure that somehow becomes something more as we grow to understand his true nature and the affliction he is battling with day to day while being surrounded by hatred of a world that lacks understanding for his condition.Little Children is very far from an uplifting experience but with these true to life and often against the odds understandable creations at the forefront, Field's film becomes an experience that will become a poignant one for many and a reassurance that everyone, no matter their circumstances, is battling in the wars of life.Final Say - If you've never seen Little Children, this is well and truly a film worth tracking down and while its often confronting and unashamedly raw in its uncompromising views of everyday human life and the ups and downs of relationship's, Field's film is a movie of real power and quiet beauty that can comfortable sit alongside other similar classics like American Beauty, Blue Velvet and Magnolia.4 ½ hastily evacuated pools out of 5",Little Children
31,leplatypus,# 03 : Desperate houseman (web),10,22 May 2015,"Honestly, the movie stills were not encouraging and i felt bad vibes for this movie before I watch it. Now and after, i think this is the best American drama that I have seen in a long time ! It has a formidable cast, the production is classic (blue / orange colorization wasn't introduced yet !) and the story speaks really to us (upper classes families as main subject weren't introduced yet !). The first thing i noticed is the voice-over of a narrator that unveils its literature origin. If i consider it, a weak movie tool (because it says that the director can't deliver the message visually) however here you are stunned by the quality of the speeches ! Then, you discover that the author really imagined great slices of life for people who can be you and me and we really care for those dreamy or labeled people. If i pick this movie for Jennifer, i admit that Kate steals the show as she is always perfect as showing her feelings. « Nite owl » and « Rorsach » are also really good. At the end, such a good movie like this really push to follow the work of this unknown director or read the author who wrote the novel !",Little Children
32,Jimmy_the_Gent4,Expect The Unexpected,9,11 October 2020,"Brad, A married stay at home dad has an affair with Sarah, a woman in a troubled marriage while Ronnie, a sex offender is released into their neighborhood.This is an excellent, unique film about suburban lust, angst and indecision. It has narration by the ""Frontline"" TV show narrator. It gives us insights into the minds of the characters, it should not work but it does. Other films would probably handle the subject matter in a more broad comic or judgmental way, this film has humor but it is more subtle and ironic. The characters are all flawed but all are sympathetic. Even Ronnie (Jackie Earle Haley) is portrayed in a human way. He was arrested for indecent exposure to a minor and now on parole. He lives with his doting mother and while he is sick he is not shown as a monster. The Brad character (Patrick Wilson) is a loving dad with a beautiful successful wife (Jennifer Connelly) but he can't get his career choices going as he keeps failing the bar exam. Sarah (Kate Winslet) is married to guy obsessed with an internet porn queen. She also has to deal with some snooty fellow suburban moms. One of them Mary Ann (Mary B McCann) is the most judgmental of them all, she is so uptight that while in a Book Club she calls ""Madame Bovary"" a sl*t and says ""She cheats on her husband and takes rat poison! Did I really need to read this?"" Adding to the mix is Larry (Noah Emmerich) an ex cop who is obsessed with harassing Ronnie the ""pervert' as he calls him. All of the characters cross paths and ends with one of the most shocking moments I have ever seen on film.The acting is brilliant by every member of the cast right down to the minor characters. Patrick Wilson is an underrated actor who done some incredible work including the box office hits ""The Conjuring"" and it's sequel. I will go out on a limb and say this is Winslet's best performance ever, which is saying a lot since she has been excellent so many times before. Hayley has the most difficult part since there are times you are disgusted by him and times you are feeling sorry for him. The sex and nudity is pretty graphic in this so it not recommended for anyone offended by that.",Little Children
33,jzappa,Change is Slow but It Has to Start Somewhere,9,13 October 2007,"Little Children is endlessly interesting because every character is is so clearcut in their reasons and feelings the lead to what they do, and we are reminded of someone we've known by each one of them. They are full and rich in their normality, and the film's ardent capture of real life is what draws the most attention. At this point in the review, however, is where I've sat here at the keyboard for several minutes trying to sum up my feelings of the movie. I enjoyed it very much, it was very well-made, as I would expect a film from Todd Field to be, as I've seen his last movie, In the Bedroom, and every effect was successful, yet I am still uncertain of what is intended to be gotten from it. Is the communication of the suburban American lifestyle and its reaction to the entrance of a sex offender supposed to be a capsule: This is a portrait of the way things are now and here it is on film forever? Could be.Kate Winslet does not cease to show the extent of her abilities as an actress. As if she's been in the precise shoes of the character before, she figures her with carefully deliberated authenticity and accommodating likability. Her appearance and disposition are always of someone with a past, and someone who is more ashamed of themselves than they deserve to be.",Little Children
34,videorama-759-859391,This ones for the children,8,11 March 2016,"Little Children, granted isn't the best movie ever made, and is probably given more credit than it deserves. It's good but not great. But may'be I should look closer, for it is quite a character study into flawed characters, a lot of who really hate themselves. It is an excellent screenplay, three interweaving stories, through characters, driven by situations and circumstances, the main plot really being the release of a known 48 year old pedophile, and an angry community. The pedo is chillingly played by Jackie Earle Hayley, in just what it is virtuoso acting, from a guy who's made way too less movies, and always impresses in other films. He's an actor to watch. But all the other performances should be commended too, some who I don't need to spout names. It also has a Happiness movie character playing much the same kind of shy character as she did in that 99 Art-house film. Little Children is very realistic, especially in the public versus pedophile scenario, where one character gets really heated, among the other of a disfavoring community. This is so real, where the great script just takes on a real approach. What I hated about little children, was that sleepy middle aged, informing voice over, to really describe how the characters feel. We don't need that. Let the characters do that. This is what minimally ruined what is otherwise a good film, with a kind of un befitting but cute title. Highly recommended.",Little Children
35,robert-temple-1,They Don't Come Better Than This,10,21 October 2007,"With this film, Hollywood finally came of age. This is as devastatingly real as any indie or foreign film has ever been. Todd Field, screenwriter and director of the amazingly powerful 'In the Bedroom' several years ago, here exceeds himself, and has made a major masterpiece. Why did it only get Oscar nominations? It should have won them! Surely Kate Winslet has never delivered a more spectacular performance. The screenplay is one of the most brilliant in years, especially considering the way it successfully embraced a multi-stranded storyline. No tightrope-walker ever pulled off a more breathtaking display than this film, which could easily have fallen over the edge, but didn't. It was right on target, in every scene, and with every agonising heartbeat. The performance by Jackie Earle Haley is a once-in-a-lifetime achievement. He need never do anything else again, he has made history with the most naked performance ever. To do what he did took the most enormous courage. Patrick Wilson was perfection itself in his role. To call this one of the best films in years is not enough. How many weeks does it take to recover from the emotional shredding involved in watching it? The bubble-wrap has been ripped off of life here, and we see what beats beneath, and it is raw. This film ranks with 'La Strada' and other such classics. The technique of the ironic narrator works well, is used sparingly, and is perfectly judged. One is tempted to use the word 'perfect' to describe everything about this film. But why not? The music is especially good. The editing is crisp. Is there any flaw? I think not. The film contains an amusing discussion about 'Madame Bovary' by Flaubert, which is often said to be the most perfectly crafted of novels. One might apply the phrase 'perfectly crafted' to this film, which is Hollywood's very own 'Madame Bovary'. They should teach this movie in film schools. Can Todd Field possibly go on directing after penetrating the magnetosphere? Is there any level higher? Let's hope so. Don't keep us waiting too long, Todd.",Little Children
36,Chris Knipp,Fine sexual drama with a small uncertainty of tone,9,23 September 2006,"Todd Field's Little Children's screenplay was written in collaboration with Tom Perrotta, on whose eponymous novel it's based. Perrotta wrote Election's, Bad Haircut's, and Joe College's funny, ironic screenplays before this. But though mildly satirical at times in its vision of middle-class white infidelity, this second film (at last) from the director of the powerful 2000 In the Bedroom, with its themes out of Cheever or Updike, also moves toward the solemn and the shocking.One big reason for that is a second plot about a just-released sex offender and a troubled ex-cop who turns into a self-appointed protector of public morality campaigning to drive the ex-prisoner out of town.Brad (Patrick Wilson) is a househusband caring for his little boy while feebly preparing for his previously failed bar exams. He has a gorgeous but emasculating wife, Kathy (Jennifer Connelly) who's a successful PBS-style documentary filmmaker. Sarah (Kate Winslet), with an MA in English, in charge of a recalcitrant little girl with whom she has little patience at times, has a well-off distant husband (Gregg Edelman) who's a pretentious adman who gets off on Web porn. Sarah and Brad meet in a park where moms take their kids, in East Wyndham, Massachusetts. They wind up kissing when they first meet, mainly to shock the other moms. Brad and Sarah spend a lot of the summer minding their kids together at the municipal pool. This turns into a torrid affair with frequent sex at Sarah's husband's large house. They're attractive, and attracted, and their general dissatisfaction with their spouses and with where they are now heightens their need to throw themselves at each other with the utmost abandon.Meanwhile Ronnie (former child actor Jackie Earle Haley, vividly remembered from Bad News Bears and Breaking Away and strong in a new way here) has come into town: he's the sex offender, a painfully self-aware one, and he lives with the one person who loves him, his aging mother Ruth (a convincing Phyllis Somerville), while the ex-cop, Larry (Noah Emmerich) wages his war as a one-man ""committee."" Larry and Brad have met and Larry persuades Brad, who already wastes time watching boys skateboarding when he's supposed to be boning up for the bar exam, to join a night touch football league team made up of cops  and thus the infidelity and the sex offender elements are linked. But they would be anyway, because this is a small community. And one particularly hot day Ronnie comes to the municipal swimming pool and causes an outcry when he's spotted ogling young girls under water.The other moms from the park, who were afraid of Brad and called him ""the Prom King,"" are gently satirized by a voice-over narration spoken by Will Lyman, of Frontline on PBS, which sounds like a high school educational film. Perrotta is, after all, a comic writer. But more of that later.The movie has a bright, intense, clear visual style, sometimes making use of extreme close-ups. Since the acting and directing are fine, this gives things a feeling of authority. It's also effective in underlining both the satirical and the sensual aspects of the story, and heightens the emotional effect when the narrative lines move toward crisis.Brad's development (the novel-based voice-over tells us) may have been arrested by his mother's dying when he was in his early teens, and this explains why he watches the skateboarding boys with such longing: they're having the playtime that was stolen from him.Another theme is that of Cheryl (Marsha Dietlein), Sarah's friend and neighbor who baby-sits with her daughter when she's having sex with Brad, speed-walks with her, and gets her into a book-discussion group leading to a pointed scene in which Madame Bovary is discussed and Sarah defends the adulterous heroine as someone who revolted in search of freedom. The older women nod approvingly, while one of the park moms doesn't get it at all.Partly because it's hard to juggle all these elements from a 350-page novel, the ironic narrative voice disappears throughout the film's midsection.At the end matters all come to a head, with Brad and Sarah, with Ronnie, and with his erstwhile nemesis, Larry, and a lot of tension is created through Hitchcockian cross-cutting between these climaxing threads.Field has avoided the extreme finale of his first film -- this one shares such heavy concerns as families, infidelity, crime, and confronting death, but by contrast, this ending, though breathless and troubling, is ultimately sweet and marked by reconciliation and acceptance. One may wonder if underlying issues have really been resolved. The film feels somewhat overlong, but the nuanced characterizations and fine acting and the attractiveness of the central couple entertain and interest us mightily.Perhaps the one weakness overall is a slight uncertainty of tone, which explains why some viewers are troubled by the voice-over (and also by its long disappearance midway). If situations are seen primarily as highly serious or even horrifying, it's hard to see how the satirical feel fits in, and at the end we seem to have lost touch with where we started out. Ultimately as with so many American stories on film, the writers seem to have tried to tackle too much material. Nothing wrong with that, but they haven't quite got the world-view to encompass it all. Technically though Field has achieved more polish and shown more confidence, even compared to his already admirable and powerful first film of five years ago. The cast is wonderful, well chosen and well used. Field is an experienced actor: he knows the craft. This has got to be a film to think about at year's end when best lists are made up.",Little Children
37,Polaris_DiB,"Mixed writing, good performance",6,21 May 2007,"This movie is certainly a mixed bag. At times poignant, at times lovely, this movie is also at times like flat soda: the sense that it should be tingly is there, but rather it's turned into a disgusting form of sweet. The problem is that it's neither here nor there enough to say anything definite about its quality, it just sort of exists as a sentimental drama featuring good performances and some amount of interesting storytelling.Sarah and Brad are two stay-at-home parents, bored, lonely, and suburban. They meet in a park due to the urging of tsking, drama-queen wives and are pretty much ready right from the get-go to jump into each other's arms. This sets off an affair, of course, that is very revealing of the lonely side of suburban life (many contemporary movies are very fond of this thing), set in contrast to the story of a pedophile who moves in and is quickly ostracized from the community: once again, to be revealing of prejudice and loneliness.What is good about this film is that it plays its angst at a minimum and allows the actors to carry almost all of the film. The camera-work is just subtle enough to give them a wonderful stage to work on, and just removed enough to keep the director invisible. The problem is its script. First of all, it involves a rather unique and interesting use of voice over--which is also probably the most pointless I've ever seen. Everything the narrator describes can already be seen and understood in the faces, movement, acting, and presence of the actors, and it feels really wrong and out of place to narrate emotions like that, especially when the actors are doing such a good job. Secondly, the ending is disappointing and rather jolting in the way it pretty much just stops the action altogether. Honestly, there has to be a million better ways of holding up Brad than that, and the character transformations don't really ring true from any direction.I think this movie ultimately boils down to a nice piece of suburban melodrama that will eventually be forgotten. But in the meantime it's still an entertaining and well-performed work that is worth a look. And, like so many other movies out there, I get the distinct impression that it's not as good as the book.--PolarisDiB",Little Children
38,strong-122-478885,"Sarah, The Adultress, And Her Man, The ""Prom KIng""",5,5 September 2016,"If you ask me - I think that a much more fitting title for this decidedly bleak, black comedy (from 2006) would have been ""American Beauty: The Sequel"".Filled to overflowing with endless ill-will and depressing personal dramas - Little Children's story of small-town gossip, infidelity, fetish, and dissatisfaction in the bedroom (as well as a bit of sexual perversion thrown into the mix, for good measure) - Left me feeling like I seriously needed to take a long, hot shower, after it was all over, in order to scrub away all of the trauma and taint that prevailed and totally saturated me during this picture's 2.2-hour running time.To be sure - Little Children is the sort of little ""tattle-tale"" soap opera that isn't gonna appeal to everyone's tastes. No way. But, with that said - It certainly did contain its fair share of truly compelling moments that helped to earn it a 5-star rating from yours truly, Dalbert Pringle.",Little Children
39,dfranzen70,Suburban Paradise Lost,9,30 July 2007,"""You couldn't change the past,"" the narrator of Little Children tells us at the movie's close, ""but the future could be a different story."" The lives of the men and women who live in the very paragon of bland suburbia appear to be crunchy (and even somewhat unforgiving) on the outside, but inside they break, well, just like a little girl. A veritable sea of emotions, from love, despair, neglect, and hate churns below their pristine, everything-in-its-place veneers.The placidity of this particular neighborhood is jolted by two things: the arrival of a sex offender (Jackie Earle Haley) and the emergence of a relationship between married-but-not-to-each-other Sarah and Brad; both events, directly and obliquely, are remarked upon by the nattering nabobs of middle-class conservatism in the town, particularly the rather particular hausfraus and soccer moms.Sarah Pierce (Winslet) is a distant mother and wife; when she and her daughter Lucy visit the neighborhood playground, she sits away from the other mothers. As an indirect result, Lucy doesn't play with the other boys and girls on the see-saws or merry-go-round - she just plays quietly. Meanwhile, as the empty-headed women babble to each other (but not Sarah), a newcomer enters their midst - a stay-at-home father, Brad, whom they mockingly call (behind his back, of course) ""The Prom King."" Sarah's marriage seems empty and devoid of purpose. Brad, for his part, is married to a breadwinner - his wife Karen (Jennifer Connelly) is a documentary filmmaker who's completely absorbed with her work. Like Sarah, Brad is a little emotionally distant from his wife and their son, Aaron, so it's no wonder he and Sarah become constant companions throughout the long, hot suburban summer, spending their days either at the park or at the public pool.The other main story thread involves the community's reaction to the presence of Ronnie McGorvey, convicted as a sex offender for flashing a young boy. Soon, there are fliers on telephone poles, and an angry outrage group is formed, led by ex-policeman Larry (Noah Emmerich), who seems to be more upset with Ronnie's existence than anyone else in the town.At its core, the movie is about repression and ""settling"" - staying with someone just because they provide you comfort but no love is no reason at all, the film explains. Committing adultery just might be an okay act, even with children involved, as long as it means a better life for the principals. Brad and Sarah transform from nodding acquaintances to good friends who take care of their kids together (Aaron and Lucy even grow to become friends, although up to that point they'd both been loners.) When the opportunity arises for them to become more, though, they take it - an act that's not easy to conceal from the prying eyes of the neighbors, let alone their respective spouses and certainly not their children. How long, if at all, can they possibly hope to maintain the charade that they're just friends? Perhaps the thought that their own, current marriages are charades in their own right gives Sarah and Brad reason to believe they can perpetuate the sham against their spouses.Meanwhile, Ronnie attempt to cope with living as a sex offender. He lives with his doting mom, who believes there is good in everyone; she realizes that what Ronnie did was wrong, but that it was an accident, and she tries in vain to protect him from the rest of the community, which is by and large out to lynch him. But the brilliant caveat here is that Ronnie is by no means a victim - not only did he do what he was accused of (although he shows remorse and a lot of self-hate), but he shows that he's capable of more of the same.In fact, that's the genius of Todd Field's film - not only are people flawed, but they're believably flawed. In Little Children, people make decisions for selfish reasons, and there's no wondrous epiphany that somehow saves the soul and good standing of the poor decision maker - people live with what they've done, or they don't make the decision in the first place.Winslet and Haley were nominated for their work here; the first-ever nomination for Haley, who was probably best known as Kelly Leak in the Bad News Bears films. He's eerie and creepy and utterly human as Ronnie McGorvey. You never really feel sympathy for the deviant, but you might feel a twinge of unease. For Winslet, this was the fifth nomination for the beauteous Briton, and it's astounding that she hasn't yet won. Then again, she's only 31 years old! Little Children is a stark, seamless, unsettling story that grabs a hold of your psyche and twists it almost to the breaking point, relying on strong performances by Winslet, Haley, Wilson, and Emmerich as well as a tortuous plot that provides quite a jaded look at the tranquility of suburban life.",Little Children

So please hide the ""little children"", but not the women since the film includes a couple of steamy sex scenes which might arouse your significant other. Director Todd Field's follow-up to the critically-lauded ""In The Bedroom"" is also embodied with plenty of in the bedroom sexterity, I mean dexterity, activities. Patrick Wilson stars as Brad Adamson, a suburban family man who is feeling a bit restless with his monotonous life. Mind you, Brad is married to the beautiful Kathy played by the ""A Beautiful Mind"" Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Connelly. Kathy is a documentary filmmaker who is also the bread-maker since Brad is preparing for the cerebral challenging Bar Exam, which he has failed twice before. Brad & Kathy have a, you guessed it, a ""little child"" named Aaron. This Adamson Family are not crazy and spooky; that is until Brad meets Sarah. Kate Winslet plays the aforementioned Sarah Pierce; a suburban family woman who is also feeling a bit restless with her monotonous life. Do you hear the adultery train wreck already? Anyway, Kathy is married to the successful Richard played by Gregg Edelman. Richard is an internet porn aficionado; no wonder they call him Dick. Richard & Kathy have a, you guessed it, a ""little child"" named Lucy. The Pierce clan should of probably moved to Ft. Pierce in order to avoid the ""Los Tarros"" treacherous land that Brad & Sarah eventually visit. However, I have not finished the big lineup of ""Little Children"". Jackie Earle Haley, the child actor of the original ""Bad News Bears"", plays a past child molester named Ronnie who brings bad news to all parents & children in the film's suburban town. Lastly, Noah Emmerich plays Larry Hedges; he is a former cop who goes a bit ""over the hedge"" by continuously harassing Ronnie. The acting of ""Little Children"" is no child's play, probably the supreme ensemble of the year. Winslet was titanic and Wilson was alluring. Also, it is not too early to state that Jackie Earle Haley's work as the molester Ronnie will be untouchable for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Writer-Director Field also keeps playing the movie-making right field successfully with his highbrow and vivid film-making imagination. Meeza Memo to Academy: Include Todd in the field of the Best Director and Best Screenplay nominations. The film's intense study of adultery, suburbia, boredom, regression, displacement, pedophilia, harassment, guilt, escapism, parenthood, and dependency gives ""Little Children"" plenty of substance to play with.

41,GiraffeDoor,Unreal and too real.,8,26 November 2019,"I'm tempted to say that this was the first ""grown up"" movie I ever saw.The last thing I want to do is sound snooty but I hope you know what I mean: not a giant monster movie, not a splatterfest, not a romantic comedy or a Teen Gross-out picture. Not an ""adult"" movie, not an ""over 18s only"" movie but a movie in which watching it makes you feel like a grown up.I read the novel because I liked this so much. It was so fresh for me, I've never seen anything like it since. The Novel really holds up and I recommend that as much or more than I recommend this and I really recommend this.They chose to keep the literary air of the book, partly by keeping the narrator which often be just an excuse to not tell the story visually but it gives this warm but disquieting tone, sort of like a send of a children's story (yes I know I said it was very grown up but bare with me).Very visually intelligent, using a freewheeling and imaginative style to capture the intimacy and secret mysticism that lives in even the most domestic of settings. The familiar vision of suburbia as a place where people try to build their perfect semi-bourgeois lives but really just stew in the quiet desperation of heteropatriarchy.The focus is on Newish Mom and would-be adulteror Sarah, but the narrative weaves an ambitious web of storylines regarding several interconnected neighbours that paint a picture of the misguided lives we lead and how none of us are really in a position to judge.The characterization of Ronnie is a definite point the movie has over the book. A much more sympathetic character that embodies the movie's main themes better and is much more fun to root for though we are constantly forced to challenge our own assumptions in this film which is a thing the movie makes us do a lot with many characters.Sexy, sensuous, sordid and sinister, there really isn't a movie like it. I used to have a problem with the ending but I like its unusual blend of optimism and pessimism. Rewatching this movie I can admit that maybe I was a bit undemanding at 14 and it may be hard for some people to take the self-assuredness of the style but I guess that's the chance you take when there is no movie quite like it.I would watch this as part of a trilogy beginning with The Woodsman and ending with Notes on a Scandal.",Little Children
42,MBunge,I never thought I'd want more of Jackie Earle Haley and less of naked Kate Winslet,4,27 April 2011,"This is a movie about responsibility and being a grown-up that would make a 40 year old want to get a fake ID and set something on fire. It's too long, too transparent, thematically archaic and features the most superfluous narration in cinema history. There's clearly a lot of care and effort being put into this film. Unfortunately, it's all in the service of a plodding story that should have never made it to the big screen. It should have been taken out behind the barn and shot.Sarah Pierce (Kate Winslet) is a self-absorbed, inattentive, unhappy suburban mother. She treats her little daughter as a burden and views her fellow suburban moms with disdain. Sarah starts up a relationship with Brad Adamson, a stay-at-home dad with a young boy he loves very much. Brad is shiftless, insecure and wants nothing more than to be in his early 20s again. Their relationship starts out platonically intimate, but they eventually start sweating together on a mattress is Sarah's attic.While those two selfishly yearning a-holes are carrying on, the movie follows a subplot about a convicted sex offender in Sarah and Brad's general vicinity. Ronnie (Jackie Earle Haley) just got out of jail for exposing himself to a child and lives with his mom (Phyllis Somerville). Ronnie is ostracized and shunned to an hysterical degree by the community. He does try to be what his mother considers a ""good boy"", yet he feels so doomed by his impulses that being a ""good boy"" consists of masturbating at the sight of a swing set.Connecting these two tales is Larry (Noah Emmerich), an ex-cop who's become Ronnie's chief persecutor and also invited Brad to join a local touch football team. He's so plainly screwed-up from the first moment he appears, you're just left painfully waiting for Larry's secret to be revealed and let down as soon as it is.Here's what is good about Little Children. Jackie Earle Haley gives a very nice performance and a scene with Ronnie being brutally honest with himself about his desires while his mother sits across from him in determined denial is really well done. Kate Winslet also gets naked, which is nice but not exactly unusual for her.As for the rest of it.zzzzzzzzzzz.I'm sorry. Thinking for this long about Little Children nearly put me into a coma. It's THAT slow, mundane and tedious. There's nothing about this tale of middle class angst that is distinctive, compelling or gratifying. Sarah and Brad are like thumbnail sketches of characters from a more interesting script. Their discontent is wearisome to watch and their big moments of self-revelation at the end are massively clichéd and downright goofy. There's also a scene involving a touch football game that goes so far beyond unintentional self-parody, it's like an unintentional self-parody of unintentional self-parody.Little Children is an adaptation of a novel authored by co-screenwriter Tom Perrotta and their may have been something in the book that fused middle class angst and child predator paranoia in a worthwhile way. Whatever that was, though, never made it into the movie. There's far too much emphasis on the thoroughly tired and worn out story of suburban dissatisfaction and adultery and far too little time is spent with Ronnie and his mom, who are the only bright spots in this dreary, drawn out debacle. For this little parable to have had a chance, it needed someone who would have ruthlessly edited down the dull as dishwater Saran and Brad and focused more attention on the subversively engaging child molester.Little Children is a production that started out with the wrong idea and no amount of skill or talent could make up for that narrative mistake. There are so many movies out there covering the same ground and doing it better, don't waste your time with this.",Little Children

A second storyline concerns Ronnie, recently paroled after serving time for indecent exposure to children, and whose presence in the neighbourhood adds an ugly side to the day-to-day concerns.Little Children is a detailed, complex and intelligently made movie with crisp editing, imaginative cinematography and several well-developed characters. Intertextual insights are provided when Sarah's book reading club discusses the famous novel by Flaubert, Madame Bovary. Sarah (who has a Masters in Literature) identifies with Emma Bovary, who was drawn into an illicit affair with a lawyer. While her neighbours condemn Bovary as a 'slut', Sarah's reading is more nuanced, detecting the dilemma where Bovary has to either accept a life of misery or struggle against it. Flaubert's critical view of Bovary was balanced by an unflattering view of the country bourgeois who oppose her - and who equate neatly with Sarah's respectable, unadventurous (if ultimately rather empty-headed) neighbours. Flaubert's novel, or a synopsis, provides clues to viewers looking for a deeper understanding of this film.Handsome hunk Brad is married to the equally visually perfect Kathy (Jennifer Connelly) yet is dismissive of outer beauty, intending to make the dowdy Sarah feel better. Perhaps a little too true to character, when Winslet gets her kit off, the scruffy hair and minimal make-up make way for beautiful bronzed tones framed by strikingly attractive locks. I couldn't help but wonder if the symbolism was less important than the natural desire of any actress to look her best during lovemaking scenes (bar Kathy Bates in About Schmidt). But however photogenic, Little Children is mostly convincing. Its detailed and leisurely pace closely resembles a novel, even if the subject matter is reminiscent of the punchier American Beauty.The main flaw of Little Children is that, for all the consummate skill in the telling, it lacks anything earth-shatteringly memorable or climactic in all of its 130 minutes. It is pleasant and mildly thought-provoking throughout, but the ending, when it comes, is a little too tidy. Another vehicle for Winslet's increasingly recognised talent, one would like Little Children to have achieved the greatness it almost so richly deserves.",Little Children
44,MaxBorg89,Engagingly dark satire,9,9 July 2007,"Few novels have had so profound insight regarding everyday life as Tom Perrotta's Little Children. Cleverly subtitled ""a satire about adult life"", that book is a provocative, poignant analysis of adulthood and all things related to it: responsibility, fear, shame, unrealized dreams and secret hopes. The film adaptation (written by Perrotta himself, alongside director Todd Field) is every bit as brilliant as the literary source, standing out as one of the most affecting dramas of 2006.Given the setting and plot, some people might find it natural to compare Little Children to American Beauty - after all, both films deal with frustrated, annoyed grown-ups who try to reinvent their lives in order to get out of apathy. Sam Mendes' masterpiece, however, contained several laugh-out-loud scenes (courtesy of Alan Ball's acerbic writing and Kevin Spacey's peerless performance) that made it seem a little lighter in places (although the underlying darkness and cynicism were always present); Field's film (which coincidentally stars Mendes' wife, Kate Winslet), on the other hand, has very little explicit humor, leaving the viewer a little more uneasy than Beauty did (in that sense, it kind of reminds of Ang Lee's The Ice Storm).At the center of the events we find Sarah Peirce (Winslet), an average housewife who is bored by her own daily routine: taking her daughter to the park or the pool, chatting with her ""friends"" (actually a bunch of shallow ladies) about nothing of particular interest, going home and having virtually no real life. The fact that her husband Richard (Gregg Edelman) is obsessed with on-line pornography doesn't make her much happier.Then one day she meets Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson), a good-looking young father whom other women have secretly dubbed ""the prom king"". Brad seemingly leads a happy life with his gorgeous spouse (Jennifer Connelly) and his son Aaron, but in reality he is quite sad: he went to law school but failed the bar exam twice, and now he doesn't really know what he wants to do. This uncertainty and dissatisfaction make him instantly connect with Sarah, leading to an adulterous love affair that provides both of them with an illusion of happiness. That it isn't going to last, though, is obvious, not just because living a double life is never easy, but also due to the new ""threat"" that scares the entire community: Ronnie McGorvey (Jackie Earle Haley), a former child molester who has just moved in with his mother (Phyllis Somerville) after being released from prison. He does not want to hurt anybody, but people find it hard to trust him nonetheless. In particular, a depressed ex cop named Larry Hedges (Noah Emmerich) intends to make sure Ronnie stays away from all children in town. Given his past, however (he quit the job after accidentally killing a 13-year old boy), chances are he might be more dangerous than helpful.The strength of Little Children lies in Field's unprejudiced vision: he does not try to make any character more likable than the other, but gives an unfiltered exposure of unhappy lives and the attempts that are made to improve them. The most crucial scene to understand the film is perhaps the one where Sarah, a former literature student, analyzes Madame Bovary during a book club session: whereas another housewife dismisses that book's main character as a slut, she says Flaubert's ""heroine"" is, in her own way, a feminist, as she could choose between leading a miserable life and struggling against it, and chose the latter. It's a powerful, interesting explanation, which relates to every character in the movie: Sarah (portrayed with an underplayed intensity by a staggering Winslet) and Brad choose to struggle because they're fed up with their lousy situation, while Larry and Ronnie (to whom Haley gives all the complexity and layers the character had in the book, avoiding what could have been a one-dimensional stereotype) prefer not to do anything because they know they had a chance and wasted it, and are no longer capable of struggling without hurting themselves or others. This is also alluded to in the very ironic title: Little Children is not about children at all, but rather about that apparent absolute happiness they seem to possess in their early years, that sense of completion and satisfaction all adults strive for but fail to reach.With such a strong screenplay and fearless cast, it's weird that Field and Perrotta decided to have the film end the way it does: instead of the novel's bold, unexpected, darkly ironic epilogue, we get a more conventional, safe closure, almost as if the filmmakers (and here is another fundamental difference between this film and American Beauty) were afraid to go all the way with their challenging view on suburban life. That doesn't detract form the film's power, though: last five minutes aside, Little Children is a clever, thought-provoking drama of the kind that deserves and justifies fascinated re-watching.",Little Children
45,jimbo-53-186511,The premise held some hope but sadly for the most part this is uninteresting drivel,1,3 November 2015,"Little Children is one of those films that essentially looks at various people's lives and tries to weave stories together in order to come to some kind of profound conclusion. Narratives of this nature are risky as when they're done wrong you can sometimes find yourself alienating your audience. Unfortunately, due to the fact that every storyline is either badly developed, ridiculous or uninteresting it did make this film a rather long and painful two hours....The idea of a 'reformed' paedophile moving into an area where lots of children are living and stirring up fear and anxiety amongst the families of those children could potentially have made for a very interesting social commentary. This was actually where I hoped that the film would have focused its attention. Sadly, for most of its running time it focused on bored suburban housewife Sarah Pierce (Kate Winslet) in a loveless marriage (yawn!!!) having an affair with another married man called Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson) who has no real direction in life and to me seemed to be living in the past. It's a trite and clichéd storyline which might have been bearable if Brad and Sarah had any character to them - the problem is that they are two of the dullest characters I've seen in a film and it made me feel mildly depressed watching them for over two hours. Whilst Sarah's reasons for wanting an affair are reasonable I struggled understanding what motivated Brad to have an affair? The only thing I remember was him being annoyed about their kid sharing a bed with them... That to me would not make most men stray (particularly as they seemed happy at other times).Another thing that really wound me up when watching this film was the voice-over; it wasn't the content of the voice-over (some of it was quite insightful), but it was more the way that the voice-over was delivered. To me it was really cheesy and sounded like something you'd hear on some lame 'self-help' video. It was just ridiculous and laughable. Sarah's life mirroring that of a fictional character called Madame Bovary was also rather cheesy. We learn during the course of the film that Sarah's husband becomes addicted to porn and Sarah makes a big deal about it (understandably) and tells her husband that 'we need to talk', but then that storyline is dropped and the next time we see her husband he's sat round a dinner table at Brad's and they're all playing happy families. To me it seemed rather pointless creating that storyline and then not taking it anywhere. The acting performances were terrible whereby nearly everyone seemed to be sleepwalking through the picture - the likes of Connelly, Wilson & Winslet are all capable of much better than this, but maybe they were all sleepwalking through the film because they were so bored by everything - hey if that's the case then I know how they feel!!!.The more 'interesting' aspect of the film involving the 'reformed' paedophile Ronnie (superbly portrayed by Jackie Haley) is virtually ignored for almost the entire running time. There's one incident in the pool and one incident when Ronnie goes on a date. The only mildly interesting storyline I found here was the storyline between Ronnie and Larry. When it's revealed that Larry killed a teenager in the mistaken belief that he was about to shoot another kid (both were carrying toy guns) I got the impression that Larry terrorised Ronnie more as a way of making himself feel less guilty for what he did to that teenager. Whilst Ronnie is an interesting character I never felt sure what the writers were trying to say about his character? He seems to be painted in a sympathetic light and doesn't show any signs that he's going to harm anyone, but then at the end of his date he goes all psycho on his date for no reason?? Then later his mum dies and we're presumably supposed to feel sorry for him again???Maybe the point of the film was to show that all humans are flawed and that in life maybe people should be given a second chance (there also seemed to be themes about letting go of the past and moving on). It's too bad that as a whole the bulk of the story is dull, boring and uninteresting (like a lot of the characters).",Little Children

The movie is slow but will not let you down and is been acted very strongly.The director had taken his due time to introduce the characters and gave a perfect introduction of all the characters, Sarah is a wife and mother of a small daughter Lucy who needs some time for herself. Brad a non-working father who wanted to have some attention and admiration for himself. Ronnie a sexual offender who finds sexual satisfaction in small kids. Larry a divorcee and retired from Police department who wanted to make the life miserable of Ronnie by bullying him.Screenplay of the movie is as mentioned earlier slow but the slow pace is very much required for the movie to build up. Acting is superb, Kate Winslet and Jackie Earle Haley were just outstanding, though Jackie had played the role of a child offender but still instead of any hate or disgust you will feel pity for him.

47,yusufpiskin,probably the most suburban film I've seen.,8,12 March 2020,"This is a film I returned to after watching once when very young. There's something quite special about the plot. The characters are raw, real, and beyond flawed. This makes them human. It's strangely compelling to have a pedophile character as a grotesque monstrosity up close in personal in a Hollywood film. Interest in him is similar to what can make Ted Bundy or Jeffrey Dahmer intriguing--they have extremely deviant behavior, but are still human nonetheless. As implied by the definition 'grotesque', the movie really goes out of the way to have the audience pity this pedo character. He clearly has a disgusting problem, but nevertheless spends a great deal of time trying to atone for a most shameful sin. He also shows signs of not being able to control his impulses, as one memorable scene attests.Freedom of choice and the consequences of these pitfalls also play a major role within. There's not a single adult character who hasn't made some unforgivable mistake. Still, they manage to continue on the best way they know how. The weight of the consequences these characters face sticks with you, and their actions become understandable. There's a scene where a retired cop confronts the pedo quite menacingly only to have his own sins be pulled out from under him by the pedos own mother. Every action in the film affects the other characters, and the ripples reaching these relationships leaves the viewer with a feeling as if acting matters, that choice matters. This alone inverts some of the dark subject matter by dragging the overall theme away from nihilism.There's this frequent upheaval of the hubris of many characters. A judgement is revoked upon learning more information several times. The films heavy and dark material serves as a reminder that we as viewers are just as capable of making horrible mistakes, learning from them, dealing with the consequences, and still finding a way to move on.With all this said, it's unsurprising that Tom Perrotta was raised Catholic as this film depicted the most radical form of proper and logical atonement for transgression I've ever seen.The symbolism of the clocks both at the beginning and end of the film was brilliant. It evoked the inevitability of how definitive fate is. Each character could not escape their past. They could try to avoid it, but it was impossible to do so.The title of the movie as well as even having a pedo as a character may attest to the children having to really inherit the horrible mistakes of the generation above them. We all inherit these sins in kind this which again speaks to the great relatability of this cast of characters.Somehow even for these broken characters, redemption may still be possible.",Little Children
48,davispittman,Raw portrayal of pain,10,21 October 2017,"Little Children (2006) is a film that follows several different characters and their painful lives. Sarah (Kate Winslet) is a wife and mother of a three year girl. Brad (Patrick Wilson) is a husband and father of a toddler aged son, he stays home with his son while his wife is the main breadwinner. They both take their children to the nearby playground during the day, that is where they end up meeting. They end up spending more and more time with one another during the day when they take their kids out. This time they spend eventually turns into an affair. They end up having sex while their spouses are at work. Then, the film also follows the character of Ronnie, played by Jackie Earle Haley. Ronnie is a sexual predator, he was arrested for exposing himself to a minor, and now he is living with his mother and everyone in the neighborhood, parents especially, are very worried that he's living near them, because of the large amount of kids in the neighborhood. There are other characters that are in the mix too, like Wilson's wife in the film, played by Jennifer Connelly, and Noah Emmerich. I will say that the acting in this film is superb all around, Winslet and Haley especially, very well deserved academy award nominations. And the writing is also just spectacular! Another well deserved nomination. The writing is done in a way that gives each character enough depth and gives a lot of description to all the events that happen. I really liked the narration throughout the movie, it added onto everything. That plus the very well written dialogue, it all comes together in a great way. 10/10 for Little Children! Most definitely recommended.",Little Children
49,fertilecelluloid,"Perceptive, tonally odd suburban drama",8,19 November 2006,"A perceptive, tonally odd suburban drama about a bunch of screwy, unhappy, dysfunctional homo sapiens. The focal point is Sarah Pierce (Kate Winslet), an unhappy, isolated wife who decides to better her existence by engaging in an affair with a Mr. Mom (Patrick Wilson) who is married to a cold, controlling woman (Jennifer Connelly). While this affair is spawning complications, a neurotic ex-cop (Noah Emmerich) has made it his life's work to harass a local man (Jackie Earle Hailey) who exposed himself to a child. Hailey's appearance at the local swimming pool causes women to hysterically rip their offspring from the water. Emmerich frequently appears on Hailey's front lawn at night to harass the sex offender and his mother (Phyllis Somerville), who stands by her son despite his sexual problems. Director Todd Field, who gave us ""In The Bedroom"", an overrated flick, has plenty of dark fun with Hailey's sexual psychosis. In one amazing scene, Hailey masturbates in front of a date and threatens to ""get her"" if she mentions the incident. At the same time, Fields paints Hailey sympathetically and questions the true substance of anti-pedo hysteria. The film is not all about Hailey, but his story is the most unique and the most fascinating aspect of the movie. Directorially, this is a much better film than ""In The Bedroom"" because it doesn't force any of its issues. Even its resolutions hardly resolve any of the problems explored. Antonio Calvache's cinematography perfectly captures the suburban veneer that papers over the misery beneath it.

51,aharmas,The Love Song of Winslett and Wilson,5,7 October 2006,"""Little Children"" could have been a great film. It has a good director behind the entire project, two very good performances by the marvelous Winslett and the reliable Wilson, but once we move beyond that, the material doesn't have the consistency it should. It lacks the visceral power this type of enterprise should have. There is never any fire or sense of danger in the film, even in its very manipulative climax.For more than two hours we are treated to the conflicted relationship between two people who don't seem to know what is really good for them. They become entangled in an affair that can lead to no good for any of the parties involved. Sadly enough, there is no sense of tension as the screenwriters seem to have forgotten to elaborate or flesh out the supporting characters. There are many scenes that fall apart because their emotional impact appears diluted or doesn't have enough build up.For example, seeing the chaotic reactions in the pool falls short of being a parody of the ""Jaws"" stampede. The villain in ""Little Children"" is not that big of a threat because he has been poorly developed. Whereas the dialog induced sleep in ""All The King's Men"", there sleep is delivered here because of the lack of an interesting dialog and a poorly written screenplay. When the members of the book club argue with each other, they have the powerful prose of ""Madame Bovary"" to use as the basis of their conflict. Later, the sexual tension of the two main characters hold our attention for a while, but other than a suspicious look by the Connely character, we are treated to endless displays of silly interaction among some secondary characters who have nothing else to do but play ball.There was an impending sense of doom in ""Blue Velvet"" where facades fell to pieces as Lynch explored the evils that lurk in that supposedly peaceful world. In ""Little Children"" there are hints that a great film could have sprung out, but somehow it fizzled out along the way.",Little Children
52,Enchorde,Slow and dark,5,8 September 2009,"Recap: Sarah is a home wife and Brad is a home dad. Both have a spouse that is somehow absent. Sarah's man Richard has become obsessed with a internet porn model and their marriage is drifting apart. Brad's wife Kathy is a dedicated documentarian that between her job and kid lost the passion with Brad. Both is unhappy but meet on the playground and form a forbidden relationship.Comments: For me, this is was a movie that I had a hard time watching but couldn't manage to turn off. Split emotions. It is a good movie, full of its own emotions. Some dark and forbidden, some much lighter. There is fear, threat and shame, but also hope, desire and even love. And all of them is interconnected in a complex mesh. It is never easy. And very interesting to follow. It is engaging. Even if the characters in some part or their actions are not very sympathetic, or even likable.But what I find hardest to bear is the two main characters, those who is easy to sympathize with, taking small steps that they feel is wrong. That shames them. It is like taking a step closer to impending doom. Something no good can come from. Or so it seems anyway. And the feel that doom is imminent is not a good to have watching a movie.Sure, I know that not all stories in real life is happy ones. And I can see why people find this interesting and intriguing.

53,Boyo-2,"Vacancy and fulfillment, guilt and more guilt",8,9 October 2006,"WOW, this was really good. A tad boring in spots and nothing much really happens but it all adds up to a fulfilling experience at the movies. I didn't like ""In the Bedroom"" at all and from the ads/reviews for this one I figured it might be more of the same, and in some ways it is and in many ways its a lot more.All of the characters are unfulfilled. Seems to be a suburban trend, like mini-vans. Winslet is front and center as an outcast within her own marriage, as a Mother and as a 'successful' person. The other mothers at the playground either pity or blame her for herself. She can't even remember to pack snacks for the kid when they go to the playground. What a pity. Truth is she really is not much of a Mother and her husband is worse. Brad (Wilson) seems to have it all together and he is a good stay-at-home Dad but his wife Kathy (Connelly) is intent on cutting off his masculinity at every turn (though I don't think she even knew she was doing it), as she's the breadwinner and seems to call all the shots within the home.In the background, beneath all this 'bliss' lies Ronnie, who recently was let out of prison for indecency charges. Everyone is outraged that he has to live in their neighborhood. On the day he shows up at the public swimming pool, 'just to cool off', a stampede of caregivers remove their kids from the pool as soon as they possibly can. Meanwhile he IS supposed to have stayed away from where children gather. Ronnie's mom, (he calls her Mommie), is extraordinarily understanding and forgiving, and not in a psycho way either. The scene where she is talking to him about people and how we go on despite the knowledge that at any moment, anything precious in our lives can be taken from us, is the most sensitive, heartfelt scene in the movie. She says 'we are all miracles' and I thought of that line a lot when I left the movie. Ronnie's Mom is the most well-balanced person in the entire movie. I'm glad the screenwriter did not choose to base his problems on her and her upbringing. She really does love her son so much that it was touching to me to see their relationship. We also have Larry, who has made it his business to tell the neighbors that they have a sexual predator in their midst, as if they didn't know. Meanwhile, he's no saint himself. He has things to atone for in his past, too. All the characters do. They are all guilty of something. They all have things they are better off hiding from themselves.All the actors are fantastic. Winslet makes every movie she's in better than it would normally be. Wilson is the perfect embodiment of a Ken doll but he's a screw-up, too, especially at the end. Connelly has her moments but she does not get a ton of screen time. Jackie is really great and I can easily see him getting a nomination for his portrayal of Ronnie. A friend of mine used to say that if you can nail your 'big' scenes, you have a pretty good chance, and the scene where he lets it all go, lets all his frustration and sadness loose, is very well done.I can recommend this movie to anyone with patience. Todd seems to fashion himself a director of small and intimate dramas and he's good at that based on this movie.

56,nycritic,The Desperate Housewife and the Prom King,10,2 June 2007,"Life in suburbia, since Ira Levin's THE STEPFORD WIVES, has been torn apart at the seams and hung to dry. It's no secret that within every happy home (that is more than likely to be overvalued into the seven digits, depending on the city and neighborhood where you live in) there will be some drama being played out, whether it's acknowledged or not.Long Island. The name alone evokes this kind of environment that veers towards complacency. It's where the days are long, lazy, where housewives take their babies to the parks to converge in snippets of small talk meant to prove to each other not that they're friends, but how better off one is over the other, where there might be a child molester in the midst.The molester in question is Ronnie McGorvey, played by Jackie Earl Healey who looks unsettlingly like Nosferatu and harbors an inner monstrosity that only once peeks out and scares the crap out of a potential, yet dull date his mother has picked out for him because after all, his mother still thinks he needs a wife and why not set him on a date? No one, of course, wants anything to do with Ronnie. One in particular, an ex-cop with a dark past named Larry (Noah Emmerich), makes an obsessive issue to stalk Ronnie and denounce him to the entire neighborhood because he believes it's his duty to protect it against the ills of a sex-offender. The town doesn't really react to it, until Larry goes too far one night.Sarah Pierce is one of the town's residents, a housewife living in sheer boredom while her husband festers in Internet porn. On a lark, she steps out of the safe haven of her ""female friends"", walks up to the young man they've dubbed the Prom King who later introduces himself as Brad Adamson, married to a working wife while he's a stay-at-home dad (although he has plans on returning to law, once he passes the bar, of course). Her introduction is bad enough, but when she kisses him to provoke her friends, she sets them off to a point where they ostracize her, and this converges during a heated discussion on the sexual politics of Flaubert's ""Madame Bovary"". See, she and Brad have, from that first meet, converged again and again in the most mundane of ways, and stepped over the line, become clandestine lovers.Todd Field's movie is elliptical. An ensemble of characters popping in and out despite focusing more attention on the characters of Sarah and Brad, it's one of the more in-depth studies of human behavior and their foibles in a gated community. These type of stories are usually rife with situations ready to be explored and while at times, the plot seems a little filled out for the purpose of presenting quirks, passions and dangerous people converge in ways that are completely believable -- don't forget, among these characters, there is a sex-offender, possibly even murderous. This is a movie that doesn't side-step its themes, and a scene where Ronnie swims, shark-like, in a pool filled with children, is truly creepy, and even more so how his character ends. LITTLE CHILDREN is a textured movie that features nuanced performances by its cast -- notably Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson who play well with each other (and look breathtaking in their nude scenes). It's best in its little scenes, especially one dinner scene late in the film where Jennifer Connelly discovers in the most off-hand of ways that her husband has been carrying on with Sarah and how she reacts to this sudden knowledge. The greatest thing about LITTLE CHILDREN is that it doesn't turn all this drama into soap: people realize that they're caught in a predicament, but don't create over-the-top scenes; instead, they react in unpredictable ways, sometimes even with compassion. It's the type of story that doesn't reduce its players to simply plot movers but actual people -- you could be witnessing the documentary of a suburb. That's good storytelling.",Little Children

It offers up the odd believable situation and characters - the problem is, these also somehow become transposed within obvious and banal plot deficiencies. What to make of all this? Are the writer and director (Tom Perrotta/Todd Field) trying to become the new Stanley Kubrick successors? (seems there was some association with Kubrick - except by this time it was becoming very evident he was sinking into his own porn soaked mediocrity). This classy production, with its lashings of sexual intensity and chilling observations - attempts to convince us it's a documentary style examination of moral failings within modern society. There's the interesting use of a narrator who's designed to sound like the smooth voice-over of those intelligent WGBH documentaries that come out of Boston – giving insights into our soulless obsession with pornography in all forms of modern media. Unfortunately, it's how they go about the script that eventually lets it all down. The story's peopled by stereo-typical Hollywood types IE: Strong Women and weak men - we are introduced to a group of women who meet in the local park with their kids. While the kids play happily these soap-opera type women gossip and ogle the only man who also takes his son to the park. They sit perched together on their bench, except one, who sits alone on the ground, yes, she's the obligatory 'different' one, that's OK, but then we are told by the narrator that she's the intelligent 'plain' one of the group (Kate Winslet plain? well...) Next, we learn she's sexually ignored by a husband who is more interested in internet porn and interferes with himself while sniffing a pair of panties once worn by his websites fantasy heroine! Now back to the handsome dad in the park – he's a low- achiever whose wife is a successful documentary maker. She wears the pants and offers him little marital 'comfort'– the scene is now set for him and Kate to get it all off for some R rated...well, you know the rest. Then we have a paedophile named Ronnie, he's just been released from jail on a charge of indecent exposure involving a minor - Jackie Earle Haley gives a chilling performance as Ronnie who's definitely a psychotic worry, (as his 'singles' first date is to find out) When the town mums see Ronnie at the local swimming pool they run screaming to grab their kids from the pool, creating another over the top scene looking as if Jaws had just popped into the pool. This now brings us to the creepily weird, failed ex-cop (and macho football team member) who will now become the super aggressive vigilantly of the piece...and on it goes for nearly 2. 1/2hrs. What might have been an intelligent, stylistic study of urban moral decline ends up as a sensationalistic wallow. Seems it's another case of acclaimed movie makers trying to top themselves and ending up being everything they shouldn't. A considerable amount of money was lavished on this Academy Award contender – understandably very little came back.",Little Children
59,DeeNine-2,Sexual realism?,9,27 April 2009,"The way director Todd Field handles human sexuality in this movie reminds me a bit of the way Todd Solondz handled it in Happiness (1998). There are the same starkly realistic depictions of a variety of human desires, lusts and cravings with perhaps an emphasis on what devotees of the missionary position might call ""perversions."" Although not quite as wild as Solondz's film, Little Children is equally challenging to politically correct notions of sexuality.Kate Winslet stars as Sarah Pierce, a suburban mom who has a Master's in English lit and a husband who finds sex in cyber space more satisfying than sex with her. She joins (at a slight distance) some other more conventional suburban moms at the local playground where they sit around and talk while watching their children play. One of the things the women talk about is Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson), who is a handsome stay at home dad who has twice fluked the bar exam. He takes care of his son while his high powered wife Kathy (Jennifer Connelly) is busy bringing home the bacon. The women don't talk to him. They watch him warily but with keen interest and call him ""the prom king."" When Sarah catches her husband having sex with his computer (so to speak) she resolves to gain the Prom King for herself, partly out of sheer romantic lust and partly out of revenge.While we watch the adulterous union unfold, we are given some perspective in the form of Ronnie J. McGorvey (played with appropriate creepiness by Jackie Earle Haley) who has just been released from prison after serving a term for exposing himself to children. A side complication arrives in the form of Larry Hedges (Noah Emmerich), who is a ""retired"" cop with a temper management problem and a tendency to find objects of hate onto which to direct his anger. Ronnie the pervert becomes his target.All this seemswell, unremarkable and even tiresome except for the fact that everybody in the movie is flawed in some very serious and interesting way, and director Field's interpretation of the characters comes down resolutely on the side of the nonconventional. In some respects what Field and Tom Perrotta, who wrote the novel from which he and Field adapted the screenplay, are saying is that the characters are all little children (hence the title). And not only that, but we're all a bit perverse. It just depends on your point of view. Sarah's parenting skills are less than optimal and it's obvious that she is bored with being a stay at home mom. Her ""perversion"" is similar to Gustav Flaubert's Madame Bovary in that she wants more out of life than being a wife and mother. She wants, as she explains to the woman's book club, what Madame Bovary wanted, to satisfy ""the hunger - the hunger for an alternative and the refusal to accept a life of unhappiness."" Brad wants to remain a child, being taken care of by his wife, while he pretends to study for the bar exam but instead plays touch football and watches the boys at the skateboard park as though a boy himself, or allows himself to be seduced by Sarah.Ronnie wants to have sex with little girls, and Sarah's husband wants to have sex with a porn star--or perhaps they just want to masturbate to fantasies of sameand so on.What makes this an excellent movie is first of all Kate Winslet who continues to prove she can play a wide variety of characters and get into their skin and become them as she has done in so many films. She brings the nuances of Sarah Pierce's character, her strengths and weaknesses, to life in a vivid and compelling way that forces us to identify with her, much the same way we identify with Madame Bovary.Also first rate is the unflinching way human sexuality is presented and the refusal to accept conventionality that is the heart of this story. I think that directors Todd Field and Todd Solondz may be working in a new genre for the 21st century that might be called ""sexual realism."" Perhaps it is just a coincidence but both directors had Jane Adams play a kind of forlorn wallflower at the game of life in both movies. Perhaps she symbolizes in some strange way the confused, frustrated and deeply masked phenomenon that is human sexuality.The real essence of the film is contained in the scene in which Ronnie enters the pool with all the children playing in it and the moms in the lounge chairs watching. Suddenly Sarah becomes aware that Ronnie the pervert is in the pool and then all the other moms become aware. There is a mass hysteria and a mass exit from the pool by the children. The moms are horrified and are desperate to know, ""Did he touch you?"" Ronnie is seen as some kind of bug-like creature who somehow will bring a contagion upon them through his touch. The point here and indeed throughout the film (and also in Solondz's film) is that we overreact to sex that offends us. We find the touch of a creepy pedophile worse than some kind of physical violence.This is a thesis that will not find acceptance in America for many years to come if ever because sexual perversity is more threatening to most Americans than extreme violence. Why this should be so is not really a mystery. But to explain it here is beyond the scope of this review, and anyway explaining it would hardly change it. However the fact that Field and Solandz are bringing it to our attention is something new and is perhaps the beginning of a challenge to conventional morality.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)",Little Children
60,wisewebwoman,This packs a nuanced emotional wallop.,8,3 November 2006,"""Little Children"" is a terrifically involving movie but I wouldn't quite shower it with all the accolades afforded it by others. It is directed and co-written by Todd Field, who also wrote and directed ""In the Bedroom"", one of my favourites.It is another riff on suburban America, one of my favourites themes, the underbelly beneath the outward serenity and wealth of suburbia. It takes place over one summer in a suburb (""village"" to the upper-class inhabitants) in Massachusetts. Kate Winslett plays Sarah, bored with her 'mom' life, disinterested in her toddler child. She meets a stay-at-home Dad (Brad, played by Patrick Wilson) in the park. He is equally dissatisfied and thoroughly emasculated by his wife, a documentary film-maker who brings home the bacon. She is played by the gorgeous Jennifer Connolly in a fairly small part.Sarah's husband, who has a taste in mailed-in used underwear and online porn, works in ""branding"" and travels out of town a good deal.Naturally, a fire is ignited between Sarah and Brad and an intense affair ensues.Underscoring the whole theme is Ronnie (Jackie Earle Haley), who is on parole from prison with a court injunction not to be within 100 yards of children. Ronnie has a record of exposing himself to small children. Ronnie's mother, played by the incredibly talented Phyllis Somerville, loves and understands her son and worries about the day she will die and leave him alone. The neighbours react with revulsion and horror to this predator in their midst. The most memorable scene takes place between himself and a 'dial-a-date' where he destroys a fragile trust that has been building. The main theme is well done. The true ""Lttle Children"" of the title are, of course, the adults in the movie. The real children are oddly in command at times, refusing to be inserted in car seats, a double stroller used for a teddy bear, a hat worn 24/7 by one child as a statement of self-assertion. Brad, for one, misses his teenage years and hangs about - and goes unnoticed by - young skateboarders.The themes are all drawn together at the end, and that is where I had difficulty.The finish is not unexpected and feels oddly formulaic for a movie that started out as anything but. I also thought that Kate Winslet, who never ceases to amaze me, was miscast and far too beautiful for the plain Jane part of Sarah. Her scene of self-loathing when confronted with the beauteous Kate, would have been more believable if she had been more ordinary.With regard to the ending, I was vaguely dissatisfied and not in the least bit surprised. Some dangling threads were left: a letter not sent when the viewer thinks it was; a speed-of-light about face for a minor character; the inconsistent narrator, in and out of the movie with large gaps of no narration...?However, I did give an 8 out of 10, for Jackie Earle Haley and the afore-mentioned Phyllis along with a riveting exploration of the reality underlying the great suburban fantasy.

61,KUAlum26,"Takes you down alleyways you're not sure you want to go,yet feel compelled to go there anyway",9,14 August 2007,"Director Todd Field,in 2001,invited us into the quiet,seemingly bucolic lives of New Englanders--specifically,one older couple--whose lives are shattered when their only son is killed in what appears to be a crime of passion. ""In the Bedroom"" was the movie,and anyone who saw that film(and I'm careful not to give any spoilers here)came to the disturbing and haunting conclusion that sometimes seemingly upstanding,clear-headed people can be turned irrational and even unrecognizable by certain situations.Five years later(And with somewhat less publicity),Field gives us this movie,which is an adaptation of a Tom Perrota novel. In it,the lives of a would-be lawyer,adrift in a marriage that seems quietly stalled(Patrick Wilson),a stifled grad student in a repressed and discouraging marriage(Kate Winslet,in her best American ascent to date)and a paroled sex-offender(JAckie EArle HAley,only somewhat recognizable from his days as a bony,cool kid actor)will cross in ways that you are forced to follow through to find out. The title is somewhat of an odd but ultimately appropriate reference to the fact that the first two characters I've mentioned are parents to small children,the third is considered to be dangerous around kids and is somewhat of a kid himself. Added to the mix are the would-be lawyer's wife(Jennifer Connelly,gracefully back-seating this film),a pleasant documentarian who may be more emotionally attached to her son than her husband/his father; a guilt-ridden,obnoxious macho ex-cop(Noah Emmerich)who leads the neighborhood watch;the gossipy,judgmental housewives on the block who both mentor and antagonize the grad student mom;the sex offender's elderly,overprotective mom; and,of course,the kids,Brad(the would-be lawyer)'s son and SArah(the grad student)'s daughter,both bright kids who almost have a certain knowing of the situation their parents are in,but offer little support and are(as one would expect)fairly powerless in this situation. The potency in this film is in the fact that,as the story unfolds,you the viewer become privy to a subtle evil going on:in other words,as the neighborhood braces for the presence of the convicted sex offender,they continue to scurry about in gossipy,surreptitious,passive-aggressive lives,covering up their own sins in varying degrees of indignancy and outrage. The presence of a narrator gives this movie not much disconnect from its roots as a novel and,for the most part,works. The camera work,minimal amount of score or music added to the film allows for the sounds of the area and settings(i.e.breezes,trees and other Flora swaying in the wind,the activities at the community pool,etc.) come through crisper and clearer. It's a movie that,in all likelihood,draw you in if you give it a chance. Director Field's work so far seems few and far between,but knowing his track record,it seems worth the wait.",Little Children
62,bobsgrock,So true to real life.,9,14 February 2008,"Little Children is so poetic, so delicate, so true to real life it just sucks you into the world of the film, a world that very well could exist in reality. The acting is tremendous with Patrick Wilson, Jennifer Connelly, Noah Emmerich, and Jackie Earle Hayley all giving some of the best performances of their careers. However, as expected, Kate Winslet carries the film through much of the second half as we watch her and Brad (Wilson) explode into an affair and the effects it has on their home lives. What makes this film so remarkable is writers Todd Field and Tom Perotta's ability to easily flow in between stories and the situations they present them in. They don't ""Hollywoodize"" this film; it is so true to real life. Even the narrator, the fantastic Will Lyman, adds great description and depth to all the scenes he is in. Overall, this is a great film, but it is the story that stays with you long after the credits roll. I can't seem to stop thinking about the moral (or immoral) choices these characters made and the negative effect it had on all them. Sarah's (Winslet) husband is a porn addict, which only adds to the already loveless marriage they share. Brad is quite distant from his wife Kathy (Connelly), mostly because she is so Oedipal with their son, who she describes as ""perfect."" Both Sarah and Brad seem ready for an affair, and indeed they do have a few trysts while their spouses are away. But, as they delve deeper in with each other, they realize they can't keep it up forever and have to make a final decision on what to do. They decide to run away, but certain circumstances stand in the way, and the film certainly doesn't end the way we want it to. Nevertheless, it ends as it should end. Both Brad and Sarah realize the foolishness in their affair, and Larry (Emmerich) makes a huge turnaround in his life. The final passage of narration sums it up perfectly. All the characters had choices, they couldn't change the past, but they could change the future. And it had to start somewhere.",Little Children
63,Philby-3,Desperately Guilty Housewives,8,5 March 2007,"Adultery in suburbia is a Hollywood perennial. Traditionally the guilty parties paid for their dalliance, but today, it seems, it's okay as long as they are not found out. Here, the forces driving them to it are carefully described. Sarah, who feels she is really an observer of the mundane suburban life, slowly falls in love with good-looking househusband Brad. Sarah's husband is a jerk-off (literally) while Brad's wife is preoccupied with her job as a documentary film-maker. The setting is a genteel middle class suburb (""East Wyndam, Massachusetts"") where everyone is terminally nice. It does not, however, take much to disturb the suburban calm. A minor sex offender (indecent exposure) is released back into the community, and paranoia bubbles straight to the surface, though chief persecutor and former cop Larry has demons of his own. This storyline does not intersect with that of Brad and Sarah until right at the end, but there is some resonance.You could almost classify this film as a comedy, a ""Desperate Housewives Two Hour Special"", but like ""American Beauty"" it touches on the hollowness, or lack of spirituality, of the affluent middle-class lifestyle. Sarah, an intelligent and well-educated person with a Masters in English Literature is obviously under-employed as a stay-at-home Mum. Brad is being pushed by his bossy wife into qualifying as a lawyer, a vocation he has neither aptitude nor interest for. So Sarah and Brad seek escape in each other's arms, giving Sarah a new take on ""Madam Bovary"". You'd give them about six months for the passion to wear out. Naturally, Nature is not allowed to run its course  you could say they have a lucky break, or at least Brad does.I thought Kate Winslett as Sarah was very, very good  a restrained performance with perfect timing. Patrick Wilson, more of a singer and stage performer than a screen actor, made a good male bimbo, but the acting honours must go to Jacky Earle Haley as Ronnie the pathetic sex offender, and Phyllis Somerville as his devoted mother.I didn't like Todd Field's first feature, ""In the Bedroom"" despite the presence of the great Tom Wilkinson, but this is a rather more cheerful piece. He and Tom Perrotta (co-screenwriter and original author) have put their fingers on the sense of unease which stalks American suburbia today, post 9/11. It takes only one sexual exhibitionist to panic an entire town (in the state that produced the witches of Salem). I'm not even sure 9/11 has much to do with it. America was founded on Puritan ideals and self denial. Now the country is rich beyond the dreams of the founding fathers and is feeling guilty about it. Maybe by the middle of this century, when China and India are richer than the US, Americans will feel happier.",Little Children
64,PatrynXX,Amazingly well done. Including the Narrator,9,19 August 2020,"The Narrator adds a bit of Art House to this movie. It kinda plays like a play. And clearly a better Thriller than Rear Window. Interesting that the sound re recording was done at Alfred Hitchcock's theater. I think for the most part he'd approve. Not sure about the nudity but he of course critique it harshly but it would still raise an eyebrow.. Really simple on it's face but gets complicated when you think about it too much. I would not watch this if you are depressed. I suffer from it but I'm not depressed at the moment. I don't think I'd watch this all the time but it seems to work out in the end in unexpected ways. Although all I can say is OUCH to the one main twist.Quality: 10/10

65,brchthethird,We all have to grow up at some point,7,20 April 2015,"Many a film have made on the subject of suburbia and while LITTLE CHILDREN doesn't do much thematically to distinguish itself from what came before, its masterful direction and excellent performances put it a notch above the rest. The story is centered around Brad (Patrick Wilson) and Sarah (Kate Winslet), each married but unsatisfied with their lives. Brad is a stay-at-home dad who has yet to pass the bar and quite a pushover when it comes to his wife. Sarah is a stay-at-home mom/writer who doesn't feel like she belongs with the gossipy mothers she hangs out with in the public park (by virtue of being around them). Amidst this idyllic suburban setting (on the surface) there is a recently released sex offender who moves into the neighborhood to live with his mother, and an ex-cop who will stop at nothing to let everyone know about the ""pervert"" who just invaded their ""sanctuary."" Thematically, the film doesn't really break any new ground. You have your put-upon husband with his domineering wife,and a wife overcome with ennui at her banal existence along with her disinterested husband. Any character type you can think of is in this film. What sets it apart somewhat is the degree to which it lets the drama speak for itself and develop more subtly, barring a couple moments which telegraph meaning rather obviously. One such moment is in a book club where the audience is deliberately clued in on a comparison between Sarah and Emma Bovary, the novel which they are discussing. I also thought the voice-over narration was a bit overdone and vocalized character motivations/thoughts that didn't necessarily need to be said out loud. Even so, the narration gave the film this storybook quality which meshed quite well with the setting and tone. Of course, all the performances were top-notch, especially from Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson. They have great on screen chemistry and the characters they portrayed seemed very realistic. Jennifer Connelly and Gregg Edelman do fine as Brad and Sarah's spouses, respectively, but they weren't really given enough screen time (especially Gregg) to make much of an impression. Outside of this, I thought the subplot about the sex offender, Ronnie McGorvey (Jackie Earle Haley), was done rather tastefully. Quite a big deal is made in the film about judging others for some ""higher cause"" (""Think of the children..."") while turning a blind eye to one's own faults and shortcomings. And based on the ending (which I won't spoil), it also seems to be making a point about the immaturity of trying to escape from one's life and responsibilities. Ultimately, LITTLE CHILDREN is rather pedestrian when it comes to the themes usually explored in these types of films and is a little too ""on the nose"" in a couple places, but its slick execution and awards-worthy performances make it worth a watch.",Little Children
66,ElijahCSkuggs,"Adultery, Football and Sexual Predators, Oh My!",9,26 January 2007,"Around three months ago I heard about a movie called Little Children. I heard it was disturbing, creepy and really not for everyone. Well, I saw it today and I wouldn't say it's disturbing or creepy (maybe a tad), but I can surely say it's not for everyone. I can't be wrong here since I saw six people walk out of the theater. I didn't understand why either. Maybe they didn't like the subject manner and nudity...pfff, wimps. Anyways I stayed and I really enjoyed it.The movie is about many things: marriage, children, work-life, sex-life, mental problems and a whole lot more. The story revolves around two separate parents who meet at a neighborhood park and eventually end up falling for one another. But what follows is a movie filled with moral dilemmas. They are both married, they both have kids, one's spouse is not right for one and the other's spouse is right, but is lacking in certain areas that he/she needs, support being one. There are a few side-stories that revolve around the main one, and I'm happy to say all work incredibly well as a team. A couple of the major side stories involve a child predator, an over-tempered cop, and both are really interesting. And that is where this little movie shines. Little Children has so much going on that you're swept up in this realistically messed up world. Don't get me wrong, the acting is great, the direction is great, the story is great, and the script is great, phew! Little Children was a movie I put on the burner for a while, and I'm definitely happy I got to check it out before it left the theaters...even though it's not really a theater movie...? Anyways, it has a lot going for it and it's definitely a movie serious film goers should check out. 8.5 outta 10",Little Children
67,jaredmobarak,Please be a good boyLittle Children,9,29 December 2006,"When you have the sort of auspicious debut that director Todd Field had with his fantastic first feature In the Bedroom, there is a big anticipation to see whether the sophomore effort can bring the same intensity. The trailer for Little Children definitely set an ominous tone with its minimalist composition of frame, the sparse amount of words, and the foreboding train sounds heard throughout. It was a great tease, doing its job to spark interest while not giving too much away. I had hoped to see the film in theatres, but unfortunately Buffalo has not been graced with its appearance, as of yet. Maybe the Golden Globe nomination will cause enough interest to bring a print to a Dipson near you, I don't know. I will say, though, if it comes to town, run out and see it. Little Children is not a perfect film; it is instead a mood piece slowly building up to a boil until it finally breaches and flows out at the end, engulfing everything in its wake.Like many suburban tales of infidelity, this movie has all the generic ingredients. A father, that is trapped in a marriage where his wife's love for their child is driving them apart from each other, making a physical relationship an impossibility, eventually meets up with a mother, who yearns to be independent and takes her angerfor choosing to watch her child alone, thus negating any chance to be by herselfout on the child she should love unconditionally. You mix in the breadwinning spouses with their own quirks and idiosyncrasies, along with friends and neighbors heightened to the point of caricature, and we have the recipe for disaster. Through it all, however, lies the x-factor of a recently released from jail, child offender whose role in this play doesn't quite come to the surface until the powerful climax. His presence is at all times prevalent and yet pushed to the background enough so that the audience can watch each story thread separately from each other and allow the filmmakers to lead us on the path they have chosen. Little Children is a deliberate and methodical piece of poetic narrative. Todd Field showed an immense restraint with his economical use of the camera in his debut film and seems to have gone even more minimal here. There is never a superfluous object in view throughout the film; each frame has been constructed with the utmost care to show us exactly what it is we need to know at that moment. When it seems about to cross the line into monotony, however, the engrossing characters on screen save it. Every actor brings their best to the table and carries the story in their actions. The juxtaposition of these real people with the overly stylized structure and background players helps bring the idea across that this is a storybook tale gone wrong. Patrick Wilson once again gives a pitch-perfect performance and adds to his flawless resume. He may do few movies compared to most, but he seems to have a knack for picking the best ones, see Hard Candy and Angels in America among others for example. Kate Winslet is wonderful as usual playing the emotional wreck of the story, a woman who never quite allows herself to be happy, and Jennifer Connelly gives a subtle performance as the wife whose controlling nature means well yet accomplishes the exact opposite of what she desires.Field has put on film a very original telling of an almost contemporary fable. At every turn it is as if he is reading us a bedtime story to the point where it blatantly alludes itself to literature, closely mirroring the stories spoken of, including that of Oedipus and Madame Bovary. Our tale is even narrated, for its duration, by Will Lyman, yet never feels gimmicky. His voice leads us through the story as each frame is turned as though a page in a book. We don't, therefore, watch a natural progression of characters evolving due to their interactions with one another. The film has always had a beginning and an end; we are just sitting down to find out what happens along the way. In other words, the idea of cinema telling us a story is literally put to use. Like any good book, eventually drawing its reader into the very fibers of the paper, absolutely needing to see what happens to the protagonists next, Little Children envelops the viewer with the desire to find out whether any of the characters can ultimately be redeemed. The beauty of humanity is that we have the capacity to forgive and facilitate second chances. Nothing could help us understand this fact more than the powerfully raw performances of both Noah Emmerich and Jackie Earle Haley. These two carry the emotional core of this film on their shoulders and are the epitome of how not to allow a mistake to shape your life.",Little Children
68,hall895,The slow-moving saga of some unhappily married people and a pervert,6,11 August 2007,"Little Children is a film with a compelling story. Actually, it's a film with multiple compelling stories. It is also a film which is wonderfully acted, all the performers seeming to hit exactly the right notes in bringing their varied characters to life. This is clearly a film which has a lot going for it. But it never quite all comes together. It's certainly not a bad film but it's not a great one either and you get the sense it could have been.In a movie with a wide array of characters Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson have the two central roles of Sarah and Brad, two suburbanites who, with reason, are not particularly happy in their respective marriages. Almost inevitably, Sarah and Brad become lovers which of course causes all kinds of complications. Playing Sarah, Winslet gives her typical reliable, brilliant performance while the lesser-known Wilson, playing Brad, is a revelation, able to match Winslet stride for stride. Playing Sarah's husband Gregg Edelman really has only a bit part but in his few on-screen moments it becomes easy to see why Sarah would stray. Unfortunately the always terrific Jennifer Connelly also has little more than a bit part as Brad's controlling wife. Connelly has a little more to do here than Edelman but she is still almost criminally underused. Noah Emmerich gives a good performance as an ex-cop, who has taken it upon himself to make life miserable for a pedophile recently released back into the community. As the mother of said pedophile Phyllis Somerville gives a rather heartbreaking performance. Everyone is loved by someone, even a monstrous pervert, and Somerville is exceptionally sympathetic in her role as she tries to care for and protect her wayward son. Meanwhile, as the pervert himself, Jackie Earle Haley turns in a simply amazing performance, the best in the film which is saying a lot considering the other names on the cast list. Haley's Ronnie is clearly unhinged, a character with no place in society. His feeble attempts to fit in are doomed to failure and you get the sense that Ronnie knows it. Haley gives a truly brave, memorable performance in bringing this rather monstrous but somehow almost sympathetic character to life.So, the story's good, the acting is terrific...but this movie also has its flaws. It's very slowly paced, at times the plot doesn't seem to be moving forward at all. You get the sense fifteen minutes or so could have been trimmed here and there without really losing anything important. As it is, too often the movie really seems to drag. With so many characters, so many stories to tell, it seems the filmmakers lost a little focus at times. A voice-over narration doesn't help the film either. Very rarely it seems does the voice-over device work in films and here it really falls flat. The voice-over seems almost condescending, telling you the characters' thoughts as if you wouldn't be smart enough to figure out their motivations for yourself. The filmmakers really should have had more faith in their audience and more faith in their own ability to get the point of their story across. In the end the film is not quite the sum of its parts. Good setup, intriguing characters, fine acting...but it never quite hits the heights you'd hope. Worth seeing but in the end a touch disappointing.",Little Children
69,Stampsfightclub,A fine none soap appreciation of real life and romance,8,25 May 2009,"Bored suburban mother Sarah (Winslet) begins an affair with married man Brad (Wilson) whilst the town is in uproar against a paedophile returning to the area Back in 1999 Sam Mendes released one of the finest romance films of the decade with a stunning look at suburban life in the critically acclaimed American Beauty. Scooping up Oscars for Spacey, Mendes, best picture and writing, the film stole hearts with a warm comic but also dramatic and sad depiction of life in America. It really is a cinematic joy.7 years later Sam Mendes' wife Kate Winslet starred here in Little Children, a charming tale of suburban life that mirrors American Beauty in many ways whilst still being unique and meaningful in its own way.We open with protests against a convicted felon returning to the suburbs after a stint in prison for indecent exposure and straight away we have a meaningful message against sex offenders, which sets the baseline for what the film sets out to be, a preaching beacon, flashing ideas of disloyalty, sexual acts and family, with murder and illegal activities encoded to give the film a full frontal drama tag. If a film ever wanted to have more significant real life issues, they would be hard pushed to beat Todd Field's picture. The heavy debate against paedophiles is very controversially depicted through the tight script, the nature of Sarah's affair in the manner in which it arrives is shocking and the concept of accidental murder is equally shocking. All depicted through some wonderful scripting, which is based against Tom Perrotta's novel. The book, apparently much heavier than the film, will prove a must read once this roles to a stop.Kate Winslet once more is Oscar nominated for her sharp worn-down parent Sarah, a woman who lives by the clock and looking for a flash of excitement to pull her out of her misery. Patrick Wilson balances his father figure well off Winslet's portrayal and the pair crank up the tension and drama in the film's context.With its strong issues and sharp performances Little Children sounds near perfect. But there are a few problems. One of the opening scenes in the park involves Sarah sitting with a few other parents talking over current neighbourhood activities. All this gossip and slang is very boring and feels like a bad episode of Desperate Housewives. The narration is sloppy and infrequent, we can easily interpret what is happening ourselves without the groggy voice spelling it out for us.The direction is reasonable enough but for a romantic drama, there are better scene stealers in American Beauty or Eyes Wide Shut. The ending is also extremely poor considering the build up we had.But, despite these minimal flaws, there is a strong likability about this 2006 release. It isn't a soap drama despite the issues, it appreciates the audience. It is very interesting, and the heavy encoding of real life issues helps involve the viewer. It is a fine picture.",Little Children
70,fwomp,"Thanks To Jackie Earle Haley, This One's Watchable",6,24 May 2007,"Like Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening in Sam Mendes' American BEAUTY, director Todd Field's (STRANGER THAN FICTION) latest take on American suburbia hits hard the great flaws that define the human condition of our current generation. Replacing Spacey and Bening this time, though, are Kate Winslet (THE HOLIDAY) and Patrick Wilson (HARD CANDY).Bored nearly to catatonia, Sarah Pierce (Winslett) finds the affections of Brad Adamson (Wilson) pretty much irresistible. Brad, a stay at home dad with an overbearing wife (played by Jennifer Connelly, DARK WATER), visits the local playground with his young son, much to the excitement of the stroller-pushing mothers in the area (he's quite the hunk.) As he and Sarah's relationship grows, they do more and more to hide it from their friends and family. Sarah also begins to despise taking care of her own child, while Brad feels the guilt of what he's doing to his family (not to mention his multiple failures to pass the bar exam.) When Brad and Sarah decide to leave their spouses (and maybe even their kids), the trauma is physical and emotional. Both realize that they're acting like ""little children,"" not taking life serious enough. But at the same time both want to act that way, to be young again, reclaim their youth, be more vibrant. Brad realizes he can't do it after a skull-crunching skateboard accident, while Sarah's inherent mothering instincts take over when her little girl disappears during a late night rendezvous with Brad.Surrounding these two are their friends, family, neighbors, and a recently paroled child stalker named Ronnie (Jackie Earle Haley). It is Ronnie that gives the entire film its much needed impact, for every scene he's in contains moments of sheer disgust and parental horror (his masturbatory behavior outside a playground will be enough to send shivers up one's spine). And it is his activities that ends up tearing at the fabric of Brad and Sarah's doomed, adulteress relationship.Although the storyline mimicked much of the aforementioned American Beauty, the story itself was exceptionally slow. Not much happens during the first 3/4 of the film, which makes yawning a frequent occurrence. But persistent viewers will be rewarded by the punctuated ending, and the exceptionally great character portrayal of Ronnie by the revoltingly perfect Mr. Haley.",Little Children

73,AngelHonesty,Mid life Crisis,6,24 October 2020,"The movie did well bringing out the clarity of why the two main characters were going through a mid life crisis. It made sense why they had the affair and where it was bringing them. But the ending did not make sense, Just because you personally come to a decision that you want to make your marriage work, does not suddenly make the issues at hand disappear. I feel that they should have brought out the spouses finding out about the affair. And how they brought their feelings and issues out into the open and worked through them to make it work. Kate Winslet was amazing as always, great acting. There should have been a bigger part for Jennifer Connelly to play, she did not receive enough screen time.",Little Children
74,oneloveall,American Smoothie,4,25 April 2007,"A surprisingly weak follow up to his acclaimed In The Bedroom, Todd Fields adapts Little Children along with the original author to a frustratingly inadequate result. Immediately the ill-suited narration betrays a cinematic incarnation dealing with this inconsequential slice of tawdry suburbia masking as high art. Fields does what he can to lend these superficial proceedings a sense of artistic dignity, though the script remains dangerously unfulfilled to the end (an Oscar nod in this category, amongst others, is troubling). Savvy watchers will be reminded of a watered down American Beauty (with a dash of Happiness thrown in for no-good measure), a film itself that might have held instantaneous cinematic bliss and topical social insight but has been shown to thematically deteriorate in retrospect. The same ignorant middle age, upper class pandering that introduced the underbelly of American cul-de-sacs to mainstream audiences has been multiplied ten-fold with this embarrassing work, leaving all the sinister motives of our neighbors on display, but none of the relative tension to go along with it- retrospect need not apply.Soaked with improperly casted supporting actors, even the always reliable Kate Winslet cannot save this drowning ship, which attempts, unsubstantially, to link her flirtatious conflicts against the backdrop of pedophilia. The connection is a weak one indeed, and using the whole Jackie Earle Haley (not that impressive aside from the obvious physical weirdness) angle proves only to be glorified filler in the dual narrative which become irresponsibly merged into an empty conclusion.It seemed many respected critics, whom I would usually endorse over your average joe any day, really misread this manipulative little chore, perhaps mistaking a few rare scenes peppered with some faint shade of emotional truth for a larger thematic assuredness I felt the movie was completely negligent on. In a script littered with characters who are not only unbelievable but unsympathetic as well, I find it hard to believe this film made as big an impact that I had heard when it first arrived, and assume the good sense informed everymen of our fair nation will help put this piece of pompous superficiality in a rightful place. It may hold a few striking moments which make a rental debatable, but Little Children proves the years-old adage ""put a few masturbation scenes in with a respectable cast, film artfully, and stir, then wait for the waves of provocative praise"". Being married to the man who is responsible for beginning to retard such combative material, Winslet should have known better.",Little Children
75,FloatingOpera7,Adults As Children: A Dark Suburban Drama,10,7 December 2006,"Little Children (2006): Starring Kate Winslet, Patrick Wilson, Jennifer Connelly, Greg Edelman, Jackie Earl Haley, Phyllis Somerville, Ty Simpkins, Sadie Goldstein, Noah Emmerich, Raymond J.

Field, Mary Goggin, Joe Gest, Celestial Hakim, Corey Ireland, Hunter Reid, Mark A. Pierce, Walker Ryan, Lisa Sample, Thomas Greaney, Catherine Wolf, Lisa Marie Palmieri, Jerry Quinn.....Director Todd Field, Screenplay Tom Perotta.""Little Children"" is the film adaptation of Tom Perotta's novel of contemporary fiction. Perotta provided the screenplay, which more or less stays true to the novel's dialog and narrative but Director Todd Field (In The Bedroom) was given some creative license and turned things around, especially in the ending, which was originally much darker. The film, however, is a dark journey from darkness to dawn for the main characters, married adults with children in the suburbs of East Coast America. While there are many children in the suburbs of this tale, the eponymous ""Little Children"" are none other than the married grown-ups, who are lost and needy in child-like fashion and are extremely selfish. Kate Winslet portrays Sarah Pierce, who is unhappily married to a dead-beat dad/lawyer (Greg Edelman) who rater than working on his marriage and family life is obsessed with internet porn. Naturally, Sarah falls for the attractive married father Brad (Patrick Wilson) known by the neighborhood women as ""The Prom King"". Brad cannot hold down a job and struggles to become a lawyer while depending on support from his more successful wife (Jennifer Connelly). Seeking to capture lost youth, as represented by the skate-boarding youth in the alley, he engages in an illicit affair with Sarah, who is also desperate to relive her exciting college days. Before long, things begin to sour for everyone. A child molester/predator is on the loose (played by Jackie Earl Haley) who, despite past incidents involving public exposure to children, remains in the residential area, supported by his loving mother (Ty Simpkins). The voice-over narrator comes off like the narrator in the hit ABC series ""Desperate Housewives"", which this film almost resembles except there is little comedy and much more intimate drama. There is no real literary merit to this film, I'm afraid, as the issue of immature adults trying to find meaning in their lives and the oft-used scenario of the suburbs as the setting for a dark drama is not original and after the hundredth time becomes dull. Nevertheless, this film is interesting and has its moments. So much of it, some have said, is pure reality and at least touches on the hidden desires and needs of adults which are, deep-down, childish. Despite the attempt to portray the principal characters in a sympathetic light, I failed to sympathize with any of them. Rather than seeking escape through passion and youthfulness, they could have simply worked things out in the traditional way which usually leads to divorce. But then the film would not have been as interesting or engaging. It is the nuance of the characters and the offbeat, slightly humorous and dark aspects that create a worthwhile film.",Little Children
76,CountZero313,broken lives,8,26 July 2008,"The quiet desperation of women (and the occasional man) trapped in the drudgery of domestic chores and swing-park banality is familiar ground for storytellers. Field has been here before with In The Bedroom, which overlaps thematically in terms of powerless people looking to take charge of their lives. Little Children is much more skewed and layered in its approach. The wry (albeit occasionally intrusive) narration pinpoints and dissects the lies and deceit, including self-deceit, that is the web holding the mundane day-to-day events together. The everyday is made extraordinary. Field masterfully creates tension and foreboding in so many scenes. The kiss in the park, the pool-clearing, the dinner party, the book club. The characters are acutely observed, especially the shrill, domineering park matriarch who runs her life, including her sex life, by the clock. There are no archetypes; questions about the characters are raised but not resolved. Is Ronnie's mother culpable in his condition? Why did Sara decide to shun childcare when she clearly balks at being a full-time mother? Why is Brad not aware he is not cut out to be a lawyer? As the film looks to resolve its intersecting narrative threads, it ambles a tad too neatly towards a satisfying ending. Brad picks a particularly odd time to engage with the skateboarders. Sara is a shade too negligent of her child in a dark, deserted park. The answers to the questions come too neatly and with too much finality. The ending is a bit of a shame, because the build up is so finely crafted. Is Sara really settling for a life under the same roof with Richard? Can Brad really regain his self-respect in that marriage? Perhaps a hint of the unresolved nature of events, a glimpse of the continuing dilemmas after that fateful night in the park, would have been more faithful to the film thematically.Kate Winslet is nuanced and powerful, but this is an ensemble piece where even the minor characters have memorable lines and actions. Certainly not an easy watch at times, but a worthwhile one.",Little Children
77,Christian_Dimartino,Beautiful.One of the best films i've ever seen.,10,4 June 2010,"Kate Winslet,Patrick Wilson, Jennifer Connelly and Jackie Earle Haley star in Director Todd Field's(In the bedroom)Little Children. Little Children is one of the best films i've ever seen. Everything about it is spectacular.The performances, the style,just everything.Little Children is the story of a few people. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson play parents from a different marriage that have affairs that start when she meets him in a park where they take their children. Jackie Earle Haley, who was a child star, stars as a sex offender. Jennifer Connelly plays Wilson's wife, who he doesn't see often.The film is wonderfully made. There is a narration that sounds like a National Geographic narration. All of the performances are terrific. Especially from Kate Winslet and Jackie Earle Haley,who earned Oscar nominations for their performances,and really deserved them. Haley is the king of creepy,and he had a really hard part to play here. Winslet, though a character who isn't supposed to be likable, is likable. All of the characters I found to be likable, though they aren't nice. This is probably the best film of 2006.

78,Isaac5855,Dashed Hopes and Dirty Little Secrets...,9,16 April 2008,"Life in suburbia is never as it seems. Lurking not far behind the doors of those identical little ranch houses with the picket fences and the perfectly manicured lawns are lost ambitions and dead passion. Even at the local playground, the parents playing with their children are not always living the portrait of domestic bliss they are trying to present. Life is full of lost ambitions and buried secrets and this seems to be the crux of Todd Field's LITTLE CHILDREN, the haunting and powerful story of a cross section of people who, somewhere along the way, gave up, settled, compromised, or erred and cannot find their way back to the lives they originally planned. Todd Field's bold and evocative screenplay focuses on five characters: Sarah is the embodiment of the term ""Desperate Housewife"", a lonely woman trapped in loveless marriage, the possessor of a Masters Degree in Literature, the obvious product of an ambition that got lost along the way to her marriage and raising an adorable daughter; Brad is a husband and father whose desire to be a lawyer has begun to fade due to two failed attempts to pass the bar and now seems content to be a Mr. Mom, raising his son and allowing his wife Kathy, a documentary filmmaker, to be the family's primary breadwinner; Ronnie is an emotionally shredded pedophile trying to eek out a viable existence in a neighborhood where he has been publicly labeled a sexual predator; Larry is an ex-cop trying to forget his accidental shooting by making Ronnie's life a living hell. Kate Winselet received an Oscar nomination for her Sarah: a woman whose discontent with her own life has her screaming on the inside. Patrick Wilson (PHANTOM OF THE OPERA)offers one of his best performances as Brad, the emasculated house husband who finds release in an affair with Sarah: Jennifer Connelly turns in the performance of her career as Brad's wife: and in the movie comeback of a lifetime, Jackie Earle Haley, in his first film in decades, is mesmerizing as Ronnie, a shell of a human being who is trying to start over again. Haley'astonishing work here earned him an Oscar nomination as well. Despite the title, this is a truly adult film, not for the squeamish or the faint of heart, but for those who are game, a challenging and gripping film that haunts long after the credits roll.",Little Children
79,bopdog,"A beautiful little gem! Rich and lush, dealing with real human emotions and lives",10,6 November 2006,"This is a most excellent movie, and really, really worth your time to seek it out and see it. I went because of Kate Winslet and Jennifer Connelly. I've liked everything they've been in, and they are two actors of the highest calibre. As an extra, I was delighted and pleased all around by this magnificent indie movie.The topic sounds a little heavy, and I would have hesitated if I'd known all the surface details beforehand. But the richness, and the lush, comfortable intimacy of the characterizations, and the 'truth', if I may use that word, of the lives and the story were so perfect, I actually found the overall experience extremely positive and entertaining.Briefly, this movie is about four families--- all of them a bit dysfunctional, and having a bit of problem. Jennifer Connelly plays a mom obsessed with her 3 or 4 year old son, thereby ignoring her husband's needs for sex and intimacy with his wife. She sleeps with the boy, and lays in bed with him like he's her 'man'. Nothing outwardly unwholesome is implied by that, but it does show what is probably, at the end of the day, an unhealthy attachment to the little guy. Her husband, played by actor Patrick Wilson, is athletic, robust, and plainly frustrated by his wife's emotional and physical absence.He isn't looking to cheat, but he nonetheless falls into temptation in the 'accidental' person of Kate Winslet. She, too, has an emotionally distant spouse--- hers, though, is an uptight businessman, and closet internet porn addict. She isn't looking to cheat, either, but her feeling of being unaccepted, 'unknown' and unappreciated have driven her to extreme loneliness. She is an outcast to her fellow neighbourhood moms at the kiddie park, for example. These feelings of being an outsider, place her in an initially innocent situation that leads to an affair with the Patrick Wilson character, Jennifer Connelly's hubby. The third 'family' is an ex-cop. We aren't told, at first, why he is not an active duty policeman anymore. I won't say here, but as the story unfolds, and we get deeper and deeper into the secret inner selves of the characters, it is revealed as a key point. All we know of his wife is that she left him, and he, for a bunch of reasons, is a very unhappy person. The fourth family is a weird and creepy sexual offender and his elderly mother.The first exposure, no pun intended, to the sexual offender is him as a pervert recently released from a two-year prison term. He is the pariah and object of fear and hysteria of the entire community, stirred up, for the most part, by the ex-cop. The ex-cop pursues a personal vendetta against the guy, forming a vigilante committee, and plastering posters over virtually every surface that will take a staple or some duct tape. His cop buddies eye him with a bit of suspicion, and seem concerned with his obsession.In the background of all this, the moms at the kids' park are obsessed with 'proper' behaviour', following their own set of rules, and looking good, as mothers are supposed to look. Etc.Everyone in the movie is lonely and afraid, even if unconsciously. And the people surrounding the principle characters all seem obsessed with something. The principle characters--- Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson, are the only 'un-obsessed' folks in the movie. Their problem is the damage done by the obsessions of others. They suffer, because those people they depend on as their life partners are not available--- no emotional and spiritual interaction. They are lonely, and they somehow find each other, start an affair, and proceed from there.This may sound kind of soap-opera-y. Oh well, it may be. But it is also very nice. I don't care for soap operas, but I was engrossed and entertained throughout this movie. If you can imagine it without plot details, the way things work out is not due to movie magic, or even luck--- but is an inevitable result of some courage, and some basic needs that force the characters to address them. A very human journey that most of us have to take in some form or another at times, and can relate to in some fashion.I found the whole thing fascinating, and uplifting. You will note that I omitted the plot details beyond the set-up. The plot isn't critical, probably, but I will preserve the surprises for you to discover on your own. I loved this movie, and highly recommend that you take the time and make the effort to see it. Knowing the way movies are typically marketed to the public, this fine little gem will probably not survive for long at the multiplex. I gave it a well deserved 10 out of 10.",Little Children
80,DonFishies,A definite thought-provoking experience,8,6 May 2007,"Near the end of 2006, I began compiling a list of movies I really wanted to see, but were only playing in limited release. As 2007 began, I saw most of them, but one I really wanted to see, Little Children, was permanently stuck in limited release. So I waited patiently for the DVD, and after seeing it, can say that I wish it had gone wide.Little Children tells the story of Sarah (Kate Winslet) and Brad (Patrick Wilson). Both live in suburbia, are stay-at-home parents to two young children and are stuck in comatose marriages. After a chance encounter at the park, the two begin a friendship that only builds from there. Juxtaposing their story is that of Ronnie (Jackie Earle Haley), a pedophile recently released from prison, who is striking fear among many parents in the community.Despite its lengthy runtime and its very dialogue driven nature, Little Children is one of the best films of 2006, and simply cannot be missed. While it can easily be said that the film is thought-provoking and inherently controversial, it is so much deeper than that. There are a lot of inner workings in the film, and more than enough that could be easily missed by a casual viewer. Deeper meanings abound, and the film is probably going to be one that is hotly debated for some time to come in the film world. The characters in this movie are not likable, and do even less likable things throughout it. It deals with a lot of hard issues, and it never strays away from feeling authentic. It does leave a lot to the imagination, but when the film does show something, it is graphic and real; almost to the point of being gratuitous. And with numerous connotations of the title alone, it is easy to see why.Being heavy on words, the script is the best about the film. A treasure trove in itself, it is packed dark humour, engrossing insight and many moments of intensely dramatic encounters. Each line sounds enthralling, and is delivered with immediacy unmatched by the majority of films released last year. The words used just convey the imagery and actions so well that you may be able to simply listen to the movie, and get as rewarding, if not a better, experience as watching it. The film is based on a book of the same name, and it was clearly wise for director Todd Field to use the writer himself to help pen the screenplay.One such item that was clearly inspired by the book is the film's unseen narrator. His voice (uncredited to Will Lyman) speaks at various points during the film, delivering quips in a uniquely smart-assed style. While it is annoying to listen to this brooding voice for the first little while, it quickly becomes a character in itself, expressing the ideas that the audience would have only been able to see through the emotions of the actors. And with such a vast vocabulary of words, the narrator shifts rather suddenly from narrating a dramatic film, to sounding like he is narrating a documentary. The rhetoric used is advanced and the voice so melancholic, that it brings a whole new meaning to the film. Unfortunately, the narration is only used sparingly, and really leaves for a lot of things to stay ambiguous. I think I would have liked to have heard it a lot more often.The acting is very good from just about everyone. Winslet and Wilson play off each other beautifully, and make even the simplest of encounters memorable. Both are naïve and immature, but act to a point where you can practically not tell that these two are actually acting. Their roles just seem too real, and their style is just too relaxed to not have this genuine feeling to them. I have always found Winslet to be reliable, and that does not change with this role. Her motives are questionable (a whole missing subplot requiring her husband is only nodded at and never truly explored), but her acting makes the audience forget that she even has a husband in the first place. Wilson (who was brilliant in Hard Candy) adds another excellent performance to his small roster, and only continues to prove that he will become a hot property in time, if he did not already seal that deal as it is.Small turns from Connelly and Noah Emmerich as a harassing ex-police officer are impressive, and have just the right amount of class to make them more than one-note characters.But the clear standout in the film is Haley. The has-been knocks this one right out of the park as the deeply conflicted and misunderstood pedophile. He is an emotional wreck for the entirety of the film, and stays very concentrated as this fragile human being. Seeing him interact with characters on screen is heartbreaking in one instant, and mortifying in another. Haley plays Ronnie as a bit of an enigma, leading the audience to really question whether they should look at him as a misunderstood adult, or as a terrifying monster. He does appear until forty-five minutes into the film, but up to that point and even after, his presence is felt.The film is not without its blemishes. As said previously, a lot of things are left totally ambiguous. We never really understand the motivations of Ronnie, or how deeply rooted his relationship is with his loving mother (played wonderfully, albeit very underused, by Phyllis Somerville). We never get a true sense of how ostracized Sarah and Brad are. There are a few too many scenes that just hint at things, but really turn out to be about not much of anything.Overall, Little Children is a rewarding experience. It has excellent writing, fantastic acting, and a story that will leave many questioning their own morals. It was talked about for a reason.8.5/10.",Little Children
81,rajdoctor,Little Children,6,4 February 2007,"Little Children Todd Field  the director of the movie has been around for quite a while and capped himself in every role one can think of in movie-making department, be a composer to assisting sound department to cameraman to electrical department to producer, actor and director. Doesn't the list look long for this multi-talented guy? And now he has brought us ""Little Children"" There are two parallel story lines running in the film  one is of an extra marital affair & promiscuity and the other is about a pedophile who is on path of reform. But underlying current of both this story is natural the urge for sex. Todd has done a brilliant job in weaving these two stories into one.Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson play the adulterous couple cheating their spouses and the spouses does not have much of a role to play in the movie  but for sake of courtesy I will mention their names  Jennifer Connelly (remember ""Black Diamond""?) and Gregg Edelman (Who?).Jackie Earle Haley plays the pedophile. The story of the pedophile opens up slowly and there is a thrill built up till the last moments of the movie  a feeling that something drastically wrong is going to happen, and that too related to this character.The story is set up in a small town where it seems everyone knows one another, and it is unbelievable that till the late second half on the movie that Jennifer hears about Kate's character through their son, even after the adulterous couple hangs around weeks together every day at the community swimming pool. Strange!! But apart from that movie is good.The movie is leisurely paced and narrates the story in a very believable way. Kate Winslet is mentioned by Patrick as a not so beautiful looking person (Did I hear it wrong?). Kate and not so beautiful  the director must be kidding himself or the audience!! But surely after the huge success of Titanic and a long lull  Kate is back with power punching performances. I think she is selecting her movies with lots of guts. And I observe that she is quite open to graphic exposures in some of her recent movies.But the movie left me unsatisfied in the last. The director lost his breadth in the end in the run and failed short of a winner.I think the nomination of screenplay for Oscar is an indication that the screenplay must be ruling the show here.Some points that I understood the story makes are that in today's society, promiscuity and sex are believed as taboo, more taboo than killing a person. A murderer can be accepted back but not a pedophile! And that questions keeps on lingering in my mind? I am waiting for a director who has courage and who breaks the taboos of societal norms and shows that promiscuity is a winner  at least in the movie. But I think the box office pressures has succumbed many great directors, and Todd is yet not a great director! I would have given the movie one point higher rating if ., see the movie and you will know what I am saying.(6.5 Stars)",Little Children
82,WriterDave,Acting Like Children...,6,29 May 2007,"Bored and lonely suburbanites (an always excellent Kate Winslet and a surprisingly good Patrick Wilson) start a steamy affair during a summer heat wave against the back drop of a convicted child molester moving into town in director Todd Field's cold adaptation of novelist Tom Perrotta's scathing indictment of middle class values. ""Little Children"" is a huge improvement over Todd Field's ridiculously overrated directorial debut, ""In the Bedroom."" Field's arrogant, faux-artiste style of directing is far better suited for the dark humor and subdued satire running throughout this film.Field can not be faulted for having a good eye behind the camera. He's especially adept at filming quiet scenes of inanimate objects, like trees blowing in the wind against the pointed roofs of suburban households. However, when people enter his camera's eye, his framing and treatment of them is cold and judgmental. You get the feeling he doesn't really like any of his characters, and utilizing a sardonic, omniscient voice-over narration attests to his god-like detachment to the lives he is filming.Superb acting from all involved keep the film watchable. Jennifer Connelly is again criminally underused but shockingly effective in one excellently staged dinner table scene where she suddenly realizes her husband (Wilson) might be more than just friends with their charming female dinner guest (Winslet).Subplots and side characters over populate the film as it strains to take on the quality of a dense and probing novel. The distractions including a police football league and the disintegration of the recently released child molester range from inane to sickening. This sadly takes away from what is an otherwise engrossing, well acted, smartly scripted view of adultery. These subplots and the frustrating conclusion leave the viewer feeling hollow and angry at themselves for having been so amused by much of it. If Field would stop judging his characters and audience so harshly he might one day make a movie worth our time.",Little Children
83,MichaelMargetis,Shockingly Powerful Satire on the Secrets of Life in Suburbia,10,18 November 2007,"Sarah Pierce: No, no, no. It's not the cheating. It's the hunger - the hunger for an alternative and the refusal to accept a life of unhappiness. In what is easily on one of the very best films of 2006, Todd Field's Little Children digs deep into the world of suburbia and all it's dirty little secrets. Adapted very closely from Tom Perrota's exquisite novel, the story follows a handful of different characters, the two central ones being Sarah (Kate Winslet) and Brad (Patrick Wilson). Sarah is a strong, intelligent, creative and independent woman, unlike the other housewives/mothers in the neighborhood, and they despise her for it. Sarah is a failed author with a Master's degree in literature, and always takes her three-year-old daughter to the neighborhood park to play. One day, a hunky but not-so-bright Mr. Mom, Brad (Patrick Wilson), comes to the park and all the moms get all gushy. The moms dare Sarah to get his phone number, and when she does, Sarah quickly becomes buddies with Brad -- eventually leading to an illustrious affair that takes place when their little children are napping. Both individuals are unhappy with their lives -- Sarah's neglectful and neurotic husband, Richard (Gregg Edeleman), is addicted to an internet porn icon, while Brad's PBS documentary filmmaker wife, Kathy (Jennifer Connelly) keeps pressuring Brad to study so he can pass the Bar exam and get his law degree. However, both of them seem to find the excitement they hunger for within one another. Other supporting character include Larry Hedges (Noah Emmerich), an aggressive ex-cop who befriends Brad, May McGovery (Phyllis Sommerville) a shut-in old lady, and Ronnie McGobery (Jackie Earl Haley), her convicted pedophile son who just got released from prison into the neighborhood after exposing himself to a little girl.Although very different from Field's previous film 'In the Bedroom', 'Little Children' is about equal in quality. Writer/Director, Todd Field, has managed to avoid the curse of the sophomore slump and succeeds in creating yet another near-perfect character study that both intrigues and impresses. His directing has improved quite a bit from his last film, with an impressive scene involving Ronnie, the convicted sex offender, going into the public pool. The directing isn't quite excellent, but what Field lacks in directing he makes up for in writing. The screenplay, which is perhaps the film's best feature, is one of the finest of year with startlingly realistic and intense dialogue. Todd Field is a lock for an Oscar nomination for his magnificent screenplay, and has a decent shot of actually winning.The entire cast of 'Little Children' is nothing short of amazing. Every performance is brilliant in it's own way, and that is something you can say about very few films. Leading the cast, Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are exceptional in what are some of the best performances of their career. Wilson does a terrific job creating a multi-dimensional character out of the seemingly dumb Brad, while Winslet delivers a flawless and emotionally moving performance that is sure to get her yet another Oscar nomination. Jennifer Connelly and Gregg Edleman are good in their very limited roles, while Noah Emmerich and Phyllis Sommerville shine in their meaty supporting roles. The real discovery of the film, is Jackie Earl Haley as the convicted sex offender who returns home to be hated and feared by everyone in the neighborhood, especially children. The former child star, Haley, turns in a gut-wrenching and painfully unsettling performance that should hands down take the Best Supporting Actor Oscar at the Academy Awards Ceremony come February. What impressed me most about Haley's turn was his ability to make the audience feel sympathy and compassion for his lewd character. At times Haley is subtle and sweet, and at others he becomes a disgusting monster, yet we never want anything bad to happen to him. That's the way it is with all the characters. Little Children is a movie that adores it's characters and although they do some less than admirable things, we are always sympathetic towards them and sometimes even rooting for them.I strongly recommend this thought-provoking drama / awkwardly hilarious black comedy to anyone looking for a well-made character study. Little Children doesn't have any big explosion, graphic violence or excessive action. It has only one special effect -- the effect it has on the audience, and as this reviewer will tell you, it's a pretty damn profound one. Grade: A",Little Children
84,ClaytonDavis,Love the Children,10,9 October 2006,"The acclaimed director of ""In the Bedroom"" brings a brand new type of adulterous love tale. Todd Field co-adapts Tom Perrotta's novel and never leaves the source material unattended. The film is multi-layered with subtle undertones and illustrious questions wrapped into a parable of two people Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson) and Sarah Pierce, (Kate Winslet) individuals that feel so disenchanted with existence that they find ""comfort"" in one another. Brad is married to Kathy, (Jennifer Connelly) a beautiful Documentary film maker that pushes her husband to pass the Bar Exam that he's successfully failed twice. She sends him on nightly trips to the library to study where Brad often gets sidetracked into watching a couple of young skaters, skate around. Sarah is working on her dissertation and retires to the playground everyday with her daughter Lucy, to reminisce with the women of the neighborhood. Sarah is married to Richard, an awkward man with underlying motives and fantasies. Although his vanishing in the film is as awkward as he is.Upon talking about raising children and busy schedules, the women of the neighborhood are delighted with the return of Brad a.k.a. ""The Prom King,"" who indulges their erotic fantasies. The attraction between Sarah and Brad isn't as obvious from the beginning but a small bet will change that. The two acquire at first, a friendship in the interest of simple companionship, a get away from their spouses, where they could feel support. After the sexual tension is ignited, it remains there through trips to the park, pool and Sarah's infamous laundry room.Todd Field's brutal honesty of adulthood in Suburbia is strikingly palpable and he never leaves the mind of the characters. Unfortunately Field and Perrotta often bring many questions about morality and judgment to the table and leave the subjects murky. The adaptation is great but there are so many points and features to make in this narrative, the two writers couldn't tackle each task. The dialogue is always engaging and inviting for the viewer; I always felt the need to listen to every word.The performances for the most part are remarkable. Patrick Wilson's ""Brad"" is extremely character-flawed. His immaturity is evident in every scene and Wilson does an impressive job of portraying that. Brad is stuck in a world, a world somewhere in between high school graduation and yesterday's pasta dinner. His identity seeking is never exposed until the meeting of Sarah and his immaturity is never more manifested until the finale. The underdeveloped character of Kathy is sometimes bothersome but with the flow of the story it fits the aura of the picture. Jennifer Connelly does well with her minimal screen time but it isn't the marvel of the film that stands out like other low-screen time performances have been in the past. Also, the great Noah Emmerich and Phyllis Somerville are great in their respective roles.The two standouts lay in the unknown comeback of Jackie Earle Haley, who plays Ronald McGovern, a recently released pedophile searching for a new beginning in a town unkind to the power of forgiveness and profound origination. In Haley, the viewer finds the most sympathy of all the players and this viewer was delighted to find it. In no way are people accepting of pedophilia, but we can start to sympathize with anyone who yearns for the restart of any kind and becomes bewildered and astray in the process. Haley's ""Ronnie"" is so tortured in his soul but does find security and contentment in his loving mother. She offers solace and guidance in Ronnie's rebuilding of life that adds to the atmosphere and provides a beautiful emotional center to the ""Children."" The other standout could be no other than the most talented young actress working today, Kate Winslet. Her ""Sarah,"" like ""Ronnie"" has a tortured persona along with a yearn for happiness that is missing in her life. The symbolism of trains in the film gave amazing insight to what Sarah and Brad were really about. Winslet falls inside of ""Sarah"" and never comes to the surface. At 31, Winslet is still thinking of different ways to enchant the audience and give us something new every time. The vivacity of ""Sarah"" is sometimes hard to swallow because of her priorities with her child and Brad but in the finale you will feel comfort in the choice of her character. But this is not by any means, the best performance of her career but a definite contender nonetheless in the competitive Actress race.The best part of the film is the complete wrapping of it in general. Despite the many questions left unanswered, I have never felt so satisfied with the resolution of a dramatic picture like ""Little Children."" There is however, a coy hollowness at the center of the film but the rest makes up for seemingly unavoidable flaws that came about. Oscar consideration should focus on Picture, Director, Actress, Supporting Actor, and Adapted Screenplay and hopefully that can be in its future. This is a very artsy type movie, not for everyone, but if the Academy is feeling like nominating a ""House of Sand and Fog"" meets ""In the Bedroom"" with a subtle side of ""Closer"" then we'll have our dramatic independent film of the year in the Oscar race.Grade: ***1/2/****",Little Children

It's skipping the bar exam to go screw in a motel. Not always looking at the big picture. Kate Winslet as always hits the mark perfectly - Patrick Wilson embodies the aging jock now a cuckold - Jennifer Connelly, always underrated and all the rest give great performances.

86,Flagrant-Baronessa,Evokes genuine interest,8,17 November 2006,"Relationship drama is on the menu and Todd Field is the waiter, with expert skill and neat presentation. 'Little Children' zooms in on suburbia, navigating the world of desperate housewives and husbands. The dish proves a pleasant diversion, with crisp performances and a tasty centre.So tasty, in fact, that Little Children is one of the most interesting films of recent years. It is far from the greatest, and is not devoid of faults, but a genuine evocation of interest should be attributed to Field's story. Every character unflinchingly demands our attention. We want to know more about precisely everyone in the community. In the front row for fascination sits Ronnie, the resident child molestor, who pends between likable and freak. He is the overriding nominator for 'Little Children'  and his presence greatly upsets the parents.Yet most salience is given to Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson as Sarah and Pierce  two lonely, bored and desperate housespouses who, in the midst of having nothing to do, innocently begin an extramarital affair with each other. Through calm narration, the film introduces Sarah as an anthropologist and remarks how she is different from the contingent of housemoms. However it becomes apparent that the director is the anthropologist and not Sarah. Indeed Field studies human relationships accordingly, interweaving loneliness, desperation, jealousy, lust and betrayal. Sarah, in fact, loses her 'objective' stance and melts in with the rest as she indulges in her passion with Brad.It needs to be said that 'Little Children' often tips over into comedy and it is this refreshing edge that bumps it up to 8/10 on my scale. It treats serious subjects, such as pedophilia, infidelity and loneliness  but it does so with the spark in the eye. A consistent cloud of laughter seemed to hover in the air of my theatre at the Stockholm Film Festival and Kate Winslet was undoubtedly the catalyst. She gives a fine performance with excellent emotional transparency, layered skill and above all with an inherent funny bone that translates to a goofy woman. The humour is surprisingly in-tune even with the other characters with all their quirks and afflictions, such as child-molestation and online pornography.Toward the end, 'Little Children' patiently crafts a sense of impending doom that deserves much credit. Nevertheless, the ending isn't the best imaginable. The film could benefit from being slightly shorter. Lastly the use of cute kids as tearjerkers is a disappointing cheap-shot used a little too often, and seems mostly a tiresome American phenomenon. Yet as a whole entity Little Children is a very interesting film that makes the best possible use of characters, relationships and suburban drama. Throw in a few exceptionally neat steadicam shots  Scorsese-style  and the experience is complete.8 out of 10",Little Children
87,rdoyle29,Liked it despite the tired subject matter,8,23 September 2017,"I really like this film despite there being quite a few reasons not to like it. It's a tale of suburban ennui, and man, there's no worse topic than suburban ennui ... just see ""American Beauty"" for an example of how bloody awful this usually is. Patrick Wilson and Kate Winslet are in unhappy marriages and they have an affair. Jackie Earle Haley is a pedophile sex offender who has moved back into the neighborhood and is being harassed by Wilson's buddy who's a disgraced cop. Everyone is portrayed and conformist and closed-minded, and there's even an omniscient narrator reading excerpts of the book it's based on. So why did I like it? Despite the hackneyed subject matter, it's a literate, humane film with well-drawn main characters played extremely well. It's tired subject matter executed just about as well as you possibly can.",Little Children
88,remyxfm,NOw this is how you end a film.,7,18 October 2020,"Beautiful portrayal of dystopian suburbia. Kate Winslet is charming as a mother who isn't quite sure what her life has become. Patrick Wilson is attractive and magnetic as a stay-at-home dad who wants something more for himself, but never seems quite sure of what it is. It's offhandedly funny, but also tragic. Little Children never fully commits to one genre, but it's fitting in this tale of suburban discomfort.",Little Children
89,Pro Jury,"Not realistic, but great casting and good acting",3,14 February 2011,"This review does contain spoilers.A movie director cannot name a character a pervert and then think that anything goes -- that the ""pervert"" in their movie can be realistically turned on by a person their own age, and a 80 year old fat person, and a transsexual, and a combo of hamsters and duct tape, or some photos of Elvis in black leather.NO! As anyone knows, in real life a hetro pervert will only chase the opposite sex. A homo pervert will only chase the same sex. A bi pervert can go either way, but bi perverts are extremely rare because they have overwhelming opportunity already. Even more, perverts are very picky. One may only chase brown hamsters with red duct tape, and be completely disinterested in white hamsters with black duct tape. Very, very picky and single minded.Anyway, in LITTLE CHILDREN the pervert is not logical. The director wants us to think he is a little kid pervert, but we see him easily become uncontrollably stimulated by an average middle age lady. What? In real life, a person who can successfully be stimulated by such an average person will be receptive and stay fairly busy chasing this easier stimulation.On a different issue, if two adults are going to set up an important late night meeting with one bringing along their sleepy kid, you would think that the last idea they would ever come up with is removing the sleepy kid from a car and walking off to a dark lonely place that is very likely to be a night hang out for local punk troublemakers. The meeting plan is not logical and was not realistic at all.",Little Children
90,asc85,What a disappointment,2,29 December 2006,"I dragged myself to the only cinema near me that was playing it. One that was so sub-divided and sub-divided that there are no good seats left after the first 10 people come in. Forget about stadium seating of course. Still, I had heard such wonderful things about Kate Winslet and Jackie Earle Haley in this movie that I thought it would be worth it. Instead, I ended up seeing one of the most over-rated, awful films of 2006.I'm sure we all see movies that are critically acclaimed but we think are awful. This is one of them for me. The plot was slow and not at all interesting, the characters completely unlikeable, and the acting not at all deserving of any of the Pre-Oscar awards it has won. The only performances that I thought were any good were ones that most people don't even talk about in this movie...Jennifer Connelly as the career-driven filmmaker, and Phyllis Somerville as the sex offender's Mom.I guess this was the American version of ""L'Enfant.""",Little Children
91,postmanwhoalwaysringstwice,Oddly creepy & sexy,9,2 October 2007,"Todd Field's ""Little Children"", which was based on the acclaimed 2004 novel by Tom Perrotta, paints a harsh picture of suburbia located somewhere between Sam Mende's ""American Beauty"" and David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet"".The film presents a place of emotional disconnection, whether it be from a spouse, a child, or oneself. In ways being an adult never looked as unglamorous and stifling as seen here what with the judgmental mothers who foist overly regimented lives upon themselves and their children and the sexually frustrated marriages of the two major characters.There are a good number of seemingly disparate things happening on the screen and between the lines in ""Little Children"", all of which can be appropriately likened to the title itself and should be allowed their own analysis elsewhere on the site. What's important here is that ""Little Children"" overcomes many of the inadequacies of its many parts thereby creating a dark, haunting, romantic, moving, and highly engaging whole.",Little Children
92,charchuk,Involving but underwhelming,6,23 February 2007,"Very disturbing and oddly compelling suburban tale that never really resolves anything. The build-up is impeccable, but, once the film's over, you're not sure what it was building up to. I suppose anti-climatic is the best word to describe it, since I didn't feel like the characters really went through enough to cause their epiphanies. There were also far too many loose plot threads, such as Sarah's husband and Kathy's suspicions, that were left dangling, and the narration - which I found brilliant - disappeared for large stretches of time. I suppose I found it too short, despite the two hour plus running time - there was just too much going on for everything to be dealt with evenly. Still, it was well-acted - though I found that Patrick Wilson, not Winslet or Haley, gave the best performance - well-directed, and well-written - at least in terms of dialogue. The story just felt underwhelming.",Little Children
93,richard_sleboe,One more happy day at the pool,9,11 January 2008,"If you look closely, everything is interesting. But while anyone can make the unusual shine, it takes a keen eye to strike a light from the ordinary. Writer-director Todd Field looks very closely at the lives of two young suburban couples, and at a few of the nameless extras on the fringes of their everyday existence, most of whom have a story of their own. Although few right-minded people think of their childhoods as particularly happy times, witnessing the constant compromise of these grown-up lives makes you wonder why you ever wanted to grow up in the first place. One of the defining moments occurs when Brad, a stay-at-home dad, goes over a note from his wife asking him to cut back on magazine subscriptions. Just to be sure, she calls to check on his decision making. Does he really need ""Men's Fitness"" and ""Sports Illustrated""? Of course he doesn't. What do really need after all? The acting is superb, and Field's sparing use of the off-screen narrator (Will Lyman) really ties the film together, making us pay attention when we otherwise may not have. The dramatic final of the tri-county night time football league alone is worth the ticket. Oh, and then there's Jennifer Conelly, in the part of the hottest working mum ever. She isn't just pretty, like a prom queen or a centerfold, but truly beautiful, not like a regular person, but like a queen or a goddess. Trust me. I looked *very* closely.",Little Children
94,monstermayhem32,great emotional film,8,23 August 2007,"I think the movie Little Children is effective in showing a single mother named Sarah played by Kate Winslet is unhappy with life and feels trapped and lone who justs wants to be happy. Brad played Patrick Wilson seems also unhappily married to his wife Kathy played by Jennifer Connelly and justs wants to be happy as well. I also love the emotional crisis that the characters go through in the film like other parents being afraid of a child Pedofile named Ronnie and his mother May wants to just protect her son. It is sad when people can't always have what they want, but in the process the film also sees the flaws that the main characters have and improve upon them.",Little Children

Still, portraying 'normal' people acting poorly toward a sex offender spoils it for me. All of these crises are self-inflicted: the wife who worships Madame Bovary only to find her cheating on her husband - no surprise. The new lover, who can't/won't grow up and seeks excitement in her arms. The cop who - perhaps to overcompensate for his own failures, stalks the sex offender. All failures in my mind because they fail to consider their actions long-term consequences. Who writes this rubbish? Or is this a sign of a masterpiece because I hate all the main characters? These topics are better handled in other movies.",Little Children
96,christian94,Telling Storytelling,9,13 February 2007,"Todd Field has become in the space of two pictures, the new voice of intellectual introspective cinema. Gifted writer, he earns his second nomination for best (adapted) screenplay at both Golden Globes & Academy Awards with this one, joining the ranks of contemporary writer Charlie Kaufman who now has three (two original and one adapted - in five films); the Cohen brothers also having two nominations for the Globes & Oscars, but from three different films and after ten screenplays.Todd thus skillfully adapts yet another novel, and with the flair for putting it to life audio-visually. The use of the satirical voice-over narrator and the experimenting with plush pertinent visuals are but examples of storytelling tools he incorporates seamlessly and that add layers, beauty and creativity to an already complex piece. Todd is primarily a great writer, but also a great director and thus the perfect storyteller. Coming from an acting background he is bar-none when it comes to giving his actors the chance to shine. Kate Winslet does just that here with her torn, innocent character, and Jennifer Connelly plays her small part well, but almost everyone is believable and add dimensions to their roles, although the cast could not quite match ""In the Bedroom"" in raw talent.Going back to the screenplay, it is rich with quirky human dialogue with its various undertones and is able to sustain interest through the intertwining of the story lines that take you for a ride. As you are high in enjoyment and involvement, you keep wondering if this pace can sustain throughout the entire 140mins. Well, in a big way, it can.The directing is fluid and although never leaving this typical small town, it feels like Todd takes us places and brings to life playgrounds, pools, football field, houses, offices... Even more so, he brings us places intellectually and emotionally. The questioning, the conflicts, the challenges, the parallels and metaphors...Coping with every day life with its small and big problems. Searching for who we are, what we really want and how that affects the ones around us. Accepting others and accepting ourselves. Parenthood. Marriagehood. Neighboorhood. Love. Friendhip. Fears. Societal pressures. Genetic predispositions. Choices. Consequences. Lies. Attraction. Cycles. Tangents. Insecurity. Awareness. Paths. Communication. Guilt. Connections. Inner world. Unresolved.In all its seeming simplicity and straightforwardness, ""Little Children"" leaves us a little bit like little children: overwhelmed, slightly confused, but always smiling. With a fabulous way of being always slightly unattainable and fleeting, this movie is like a dreamy romantic love affair that is too good to become a sustainable stable long term relationship, that is, that is too good to be true, but not false enough not to be thoroughly enjoyed.A movie that enchant you, make you laugh, smile, think and feel. What more can one ask from a cinematic journey?",Little Children
97,tccandler,"""Little Children Naively Wish for Happily Ever After...""",10,3 November 2006,"There are brilliant films -- and then there are films with brilliance in them. ""Little Children"" is the latter. It may be the most disappointing four-star film I have ever seen. I felt so unsatisfied as I left the theatre. Perhaps that was the point. Perhaps the director wanted me to feel like the characters. I was left pondering, ""What might have been?"" Unhappy marriages. Unsatisfied lives. There is nothing more depressing than living a boring life. Throw in some toddlers, and there is no greater sense of entrapment. Poor decisions, early in life, can lead to desperate choices later. And there is no worse decision than picking the wrong person to spend your life with. There comes a time in every marriage, even the seemingly happy & healthy ones, when you stare across the breakfast table and think that you'd rather be staring at someone else.""Little Children"" stars Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson as two halves of separate marriages, each with a child, whose playground afternoons fatefully merge their discontented worlds.Sarah Pierce (Winslet) is married to a dullard addicted to an internet fetish site. Her husband is a virtual non-entity in her life, as she busies herself with their daughter, her nightly exercise walk and psychoanalyzing the local soccer-moms. The comparison to Madame Bovary's story becomes evident when she is invited to a local book club meeting.Brad Adamson (Wilson) has a rather different case of ennui. He is the stay-at-home father married to Kathy (Jennifer Connelly), a somewhat emotionally distant wife who brings home the family bacon as a documentary filmmaker. Their marriage is one governed by her permission. Consider the scene where he submissively suggests that he might get a cellphone. Also, notice the nervousness that accompanies a hint of rare sex. Brad doesn't really feel any different than a loyal pet gleeful at the occasional treat.The connection between Sarah and Brad is sparked by an innocent kissing prank, intended to make the gaggle of conservative suburban mothers ravenously jealous. They refer to Brad as ""The Prom King"", admiring from a distance, never having mustered up the courage to even speak to him.Winslet and Wilson play these characters with an understated melancholy -- unearthing their mutual attraction, not in a fit of passion, but in the natural course of daily events. Brad and Sarah feel right together. They feel safe together. They neither feel superior to, nor condescended by one another. They fill each other's voids. It is only inevitable that they give in to temptation.This tremendously observant film is not just about the connection between the central couple. There are periphery characters, not the least of which are the other marital halves. Gregg Edelmann looks the part of a bedraggled, office-tied, salesman who is utterly unaware of the stench-of-boring that exudes from every pore of his skin.Jennifer Connelly delivers, yet again, in a stark performance that requires her to impact the viewer with limited screen time. There are two scenes where her intense glare speak a thousand words. It is a powerful, if underwritten, turn.Noah Emmerich and Jackie Earle Haley have complex roles that demand dramatic shifts of tone. Both play extremely flawed characters without exploiting or sympathizing those flaws. And Jane Adams, one of my favorite character actresses, delivers a heart-wrenching portrait in a small side-chapter of the film.However, it is the leads who deliver the finest work. Kate Winslet is virtually unchallenged as the definitive actress of this era. She never misses the mark. Her role as Sarah is intricate and deep, beyond the actions and the words. She is able to craft a complete embodiment of loneliness and the struggle to attain a morsel of happiness in this sad world. Winslet has paid her dues with great roles for over a decade -- It is time for her Oscar moment.Patrick Wilson, also seen the in the fantastic indie thriller, ""Hard Candy"", adds to his impressive résumé with this role as a directionless man, almost begging to have someone show him the way to contentment. It is superb work.I also want to give a special nod to the narration. It is deliciously delivered throughout the film, adding a very literary feel to the proceedings. There is a rather comical use of it during a football scene, mimicking the renowned NFL films voiceovers.The problem, which causes me to proclaim this to be the most disappointing four-star film ever, is that it has misplaced focus. I don't mind a film that meanders. I don't mind a film that has multiple characters and threads. However, I do mind when a film takes me away from what I am truly interested in, only to show me threads and characters that have overstayed their welcome. ""Little Children"" works masterfully when it tells the central story of Sarah and Brad. It derails ever so slightly when it spends an inordinate amount of time with the two flawed characters played by Emmerich and Haley. One a vengeful ex-cop, the other a released pedophile... Both are interesting diversions, but neither are deserving of as much attention as the camera ultimately gives them. I would much rather have spent more time with the main couple or their spouses.I felt like it was Thanksgiving dinner... only I got tons of stuffing and got screwed on the turkey. Sure... the stuffing is good. But I wanted more turkey damn-it!!! And where's my cranberry sauce? ""Little Children"" comes microscopically close to being an insightful masterpiece on the disillusionment of suburban marriage. It gets too involved with the sub-plots to fully achieve that goal. However, when it does get back on track, this 2006 beauty gathers steam like an old locomotive headed to one of two places -- happily ever after or the tragedy of a boring life.Written by TC Candler IndependentCritics.com",Little Children

Will Lyman's omniscient narration (ala Mary Alice of Desperate Housewives) enjoyably set the mood of watching a curious documentary; however, the inconsistency of his voice-over appearances was puzzling.Little Children affirms the illogical and absurd reality of human nature: cheating on a hot supportive wife with someone socially inferior, infidelity to one's rich husband addicted to Internet porn, the overwhelmingly cruel, holier-than-thou behavior of the supposedly civilized toward the mentally ill, and the stupidity of theoretically intelligent people.Todd Field's cross-cutting techniques and extreme close-ups were exceptional and well motivated. While the movie could use tighter editing, it can also be reinterpreted as a reflection of the characters' idyllic situations. Field successfully shows the dark side of every one, while ably portraying a societal evil as human, something not commonly done. Former child star Jackie Earle Haley chillingly plays the sex offender on parole but acts earnest enough to merit empathy from the audience.Jennifer Connelly does a brilliantly complex role of Kathy, the breadwinner wife, who does not really emasculate but in fact heroically supports and stands by Brad, her equally gorgeous stay-at-home husband (played by Patrick Wilson), who has yet to pass the bar exam. Kate Winslet is naked a lot again (as in a good number of her movies) and does a disturbingly accurate portrayal of Sarah, a dissatisfied and overeducated housewife who does not have the best maternal instincts and has an intense affair with Brad.

I can't imagine why ""Little Children"" was overlooked at this years Oscar. In my opinion, it stands its own against ""The Departed"" et al. Update: Having seen the exalted ""Little Miss Sunshine"" with Supporting Actor Winner Alan Arkin, all I can say is, Jackie Earl Haley was robbed!!!! What a travesty of justice!!!",Little Children
104,moutonbear25,Acting like children.,8,12 October 2006,"LITTLE CHILDREN Written by Todd Field and Tom Perrotta Directed by Todd FieldWriter and director, Todd Field has a special talent. He has a knack for making his audience squirm in their seats while their stomachs turn. He is not a master horror filmmaker but rather a minimal dramatist with a keen understanding of the peculiarities of human behaviour. I left his latest film, LITTLE CHILDREN, feeling like I might throw up, just as I had when I left his first and last film, IN THE BEDROOM. Only this time, I left with more than just feeling that I had been emotionally hollowed; this time I left feeling puzzled. At this point, I would ordinarily explain briefly what LITTLE CHILDREN was about but that is a task I cannot do briefly. Put simply, without grasping any of its scope at all, LITTLE CHILDREN is another slice of life picture about the banalities of suburban existence. The mommies meet in the park on a daily basis and ogle the one single dad amongst them as their kids run amuck. Husbands turn to internet pornography or other women to get the fixes they stopped getting from their wives before sitting down to dinner with them. And this particular neighborhood welcomes back a former resident, fresh from his stint in jail for exposing himself to a minor, by plastering every post on the street with signs that ask, ""Are your children safe?"" Field's s timely reveal of the story elements and skillfully vigorous visuals draw you in to the raw unraveling of his characters, gracefully played by Kate Winslet, Patrick Wilson and Jennifer Connelly. LITTLE CHILDREN is fascinating and compelling without having any clear reason why it is either of these things. You may ask yourself where this is all going when you watch but you won't care to know the answer.Life gets stale when you aren't paying attention or even when you're just trying to master the juggling act. Life is also very good at throwing another ball into the mess when you've just gotten the hang of juggling three. On one day, in the park and on a dare, Sarah Pierce (Winslet) introduces herself to Brad Adamson (Wilson). She has wagered five dollars with the other mommies that she can get Brad's phone number. Both Brad and Sarah are married but that doesn't factor into this game. At least it doesn't until the bet somehow goes too far and the two kiss. They catch themselves and each other completely off guard. Sarah is married to a man she doesn't love and has a three-year-old daughter for whom she has more distaste than love for. Brad has not been able to pass the bar exam since finishing law school and spends his evenings away from his wife (Connelly) watching teenagers skateboard when he's supposed to be studying. Their kiss is meant to taunt the other mommies but instead it cracks their worlds open to reveal new possibilities. It isn't long before they meet again and it isn't long after that until they end up naked in Sarah's laundry room. Given what an inattentive sap her husband is, it is a joy to watch Sarah send Brad signals, showing off her new bathing suit at the public pool or asking Brad to rub lotion on her back. It is also exciting to watch Brad reluctantly respond to these signals. He has a stunning and brilliant woman in his life and yet he navigates towards Sarah. It isn't love that is growing between them but an energy that affirms to each that they are in fact alive.LITTLE CHILDREN's secondary plot is also brilliantly executed but adds a level of depth to a film that was already dug pretty deep to start with. When Ronnie (Jackie Earle Haley) moves back in with his mother (Phyllis Somerville), there is outrage amongst the residents of this suburb at the ""pervert's"" arrival. Whereas Ronnie's return defines the period in which Sarah and Brad's affair takes place, it also makes the film seem as if it were trying to tackle more than it should have. The abuse Ronnie endures from some of the locals encourages sympathy for him but he is not reformed. Tying both plots together seamlessly, Ronnie violates his parole and, with flippers and snorkel in place, crashes the public pool in the middle of a heat wave, while Sarah and Brad flirt carefully in the shade. Ronnie lusts for all the tiny legs treading in the water until he is discovered. Amidst hysteria, all the children exit the pool into the arms of their parents and they all stare horrifically as authorities escort him out. What happens next is the perfect example of the dark humour that runs throughout LITTLE CHILDREN. Panic turns back into play in a split second as all the children jump back into the pool and the parents resume their previous conversations. Is Ronnie's presence in the neighborhood truly causing anyone to lose sleep or is just the drama that they all love? Crave? Need?It was only after I left the theatre that I was able to reel in all my thoughts on LITTLE CHILDREN. A conversation in a yellow cab led me to see that the key lies in the title. As Sarah runs from the responsibility of having a daughter, as Brad plays football with his buddies when he should be studying, as Sarah's husband surfs for porn while he's at work, as Brad's wife purposefully drops her spoon on the floor so she can look under the table to catch her husband playing with Sarah's feet, it becomes clear that every one of these adults is doing the exact same thing; they are all acting like little children.",Little Children
105,screenwriter-14,A Brilliant and Chilling Todd Field Film,10,23 November 2006,"Todd Field has directed a masterpiece of a chilling story of married suburbanites in LITTLE CHILDREN and the character development, dialog and writing is excellent from the first frame to the last. Kate Winslet is simply outstanding in her role and you feel her hunger and pain for a meaningful relationship from the very first scene. Patrick Wilson is the ""soul mate"" of Kate's character and they both mirror his desire for a life where he is respected for who he is, not the Lawyer he doesn't want to be, which propels his story forward,along with Kate's own needs. And Jennifer Connelly is quietly compelling as the wife, along with a very strong supporting cast.LITTLE CHILDREN has such a strong picture of American suburbia and the film reminds me of THE DREAM TUNNEL, by Michael P. Richards, of three couples who commute into San Francisco for the American dream, but then return to a world of suburban infidelity. And the other story of the male child molester thrown into the film adds to the tension of the couples struggle for happiness and meaningful lives.In the coming weeks, I look forward to Todd Field and LITTLE CHILDREN receiving the kudos and accolades which this film deserves.",Little Children

It's one of those films that runs the gamut of emotion, and what begins as a light-hearted film about the lives of ordinary people, turns out to be a film about sacrifice, acceptance, and dealing with your inner demons. The acting was PHENOMENAL, the script was nuanced and well-written, and the cinematography was understated but effective. It reminds me of American Beauty, in that it is a film that deserves all of the accolades it is meant to garner, and should be seen by not only fans of great acting, but anyone who cares about talented film making. One of the best American films I have seen in a long time. I could not recommend it any higher.",Little Children

108,brian_r_wright,"Odd, tragicomic tale of romantics",8,27 May 2007,"This one slipped by me last year, though Kate Winslet and Jackie Earle Haley were up for Oscars for best actress and best supporting actor, respectively, and the writers were up for best screenplay. It's an odd movie for a number of reasons, but I found the voice-over narrative really funny, like one of those wild and crazy documentaries of the 50s: ""Bob becomes irritable when his golfing clubs are misplaced in the garage.""""Nancy wishes her bottom were not so large as she walks to her normal sunbathing location on the beach.""The story starts in a park where an impromptu frustrated-wives club has formed with Sarah Pierce (Winslet) as an overeducated, and somewhat reluctant member. Sarah and the other young women gossip and watch over their handful of children.The most titillating gossip is about a young house husband (Patrick Wilson as Brad Adamson) who brings his boy to the park as well. Calling him the Prom King, the other women fantasize about this attractive guy who keeps to himself. Sarah doesn't understand the fuss, and when the girls dare her to get his phone number she walks right up and makes introductions.In fact, as a joke she gets him to kiss her, which scandalizes the girls and eventually sends the two down the road of adulterous bliss. Sarah's husband has disconnected from her via Internet panty-worship, and Adam's professionally superaccomplished wife (Jennifer Connelly as Kathy Adamson) treats him like a child. The development of hot, steamy romancewhere we get to see a lot of Kate Winslett (if you like that sort of thing)leads them to consider running off together, a totally impractical idea especially considering their two children. Sarah's sad, slow little girl is named Lucy (Sadie Goldstein) and Adam's shy little boywhom Mom insists on letting sleep in the marital bedis named Aaron (Ty Simpkins). Both Lucy and Aaron are underdeveloped five-year-old-somethings, and just as their parents come out of their shells together the kids grow more healthily assertive in each other's company.Enter the subplot:...For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2007",Little Children
109,arthera09,still conflicted about this movie,8,12 March 2008,"I am not sure about this movie. It had some really good writing. Some top notch acting and a very adult theme that never considered backing off to make the viewer happy. The title did not refer to any children even though there were plenty of children, but referred to the adults and how they were all in some way just children in adult bodies. They did not even really have adult responsibilities except to watch over their own children and even in that they resented their children. I am not sure I like the narrator being a little overt, but it worked for certain moments. It kept popping in and seemed to destroy the flow of the movie. I think a lot of was said in the movie could have been said in a cleaner fashion. All of the criticisms does not stop this from being a good movie. At first I was going to rate it lower but them realized what the movie was trying to do by having the pedophile and the adults in the same world and interacting on a limited basis. The use of Jennifer Connely was a little disappointing and I thought it was funny how she was describe as a knock-out which is a not doing her justice at all, but her one scene when she discovers that Wilson is cheating on her with Winslet is really well done by her. Both of the leads were really good, and I really like Patrick Wilson and of course Kate Winslet is one of my favorite female actresses. I think that they tried to pass of as unattractive failed, but it almost worked. What can we say about Jakie Early Haley. That was an amazing performance where you wanted to sympathize with him and just kept flip flopping about him and then just turns into a terribly tragic moment at the end. A really shocking ending and very powerful. The women playing his mother was also really good and surprised me as such a caring mother with unwavering love for her son and faith in the goodness of him. This movie reminds us that a lot of us need to grow up, not just the ""weirdos"", but people who want to believe that they are well established. Wilson asking to get a cell phone. Winslet craving for a boy to think she is desirable. It was well done, but for the most part it did not flow well as a movie. It could have been shorter, or at least feel more connected as a movie. More interacting between the leads and Haley would have been nice and just more Haley would have been nice even if his scenes were the most uncomfortable in the movie.",Little Children
110,lbournelos,Interesting,8,19 April 2019,"Although unexpected. It made me think a lot during watching and after the end.

111,film_riot,Little Children,7,19 August 2007,"Life in suburbia is the topic of Todd Field's ""Little Children"". It has an excellent cast. The formal structure of this movie is very interesting. At first you think you get your usual way of storytelling, because the story focuses on Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson. We get to know them and their sphere and their affair, along with their wishes and realities, dominates the movie. But at a certain point, suddenly this film loses the couple and focuses on a parallel storyline that (at first) only slightly overlaps with the other storyline. It includes a released child molester and a failed ex-cop. Maybe this structure is Field's way of trying to cover suburban life thoroughly. The tone of the movie is always very fitting and something that was also very conspicuous is how realistic the sex scenes are done. Very refreshing for an US-American movie. A few of the characters may be a bit clichéd (Ex-cop, the other mommies), but overall ""Little Children"" is very good.",Little Children
112,twanurit,Quietly Powerful,9,22 November 2006,"The director Todd Field is a masterful storyteller in this suburban drama of 2 couples' hangups and secrets, and featuring a just-released child molester character. Performances by all are mesmerizing, and there's a tension throughout this somewhat disturbing film. Even in peaceful scenes, one feels that something bad is about to occur, a tribute to the director and cinematographer. It's a truly a gripping film, one of the year's best, with Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson superb, and Jackie Earle Haley a revelation as the ex-con, and Phyllis Somerville as his mother. (Curious trivia note: both leading ladies strongly resemble two ""Creature"" ladies - Jennifer Connelly for Julie Adams in ""Creature From the Black Lagoon"" - 1954, and Winslet for Lori Nelson in ""Revenge of the Creature"" - 1955. Check them out).",Little Children
113,nturner,Two Hours of Superior Entertainment,9,8 November 2008,"Little Children is an engrossing combination of interesting and unusual character studies with a tinge of humor and many superior acting performances. It is taken from a novel by Tom Perrotta who seems to have a knack for creating edgy characters that combine badness and wit. The film Election is also based upon one of his books. As an aside, if you haven't seen Election, I highly recommend it as it contains a powerhouse performance by Reese Witherspoon. I know she won the Oscar for Walk the Line, but I feel her work in Election is much overlooked.The characters Perrotta gives us in Little Children are quite a mixed bag. They range from the bored and dissatisfied housewife who falls into an affair with a hunky househusband in her community to a pitiful sex offender and the disgraced ex-cop who is out to harass him to the nth degree.Kate Winslet plays the housewife, a role for which she was nominated for an Academy Award - and rightly so. Housewife Sarah Pierce spends her days drifting through life taking care of her young daughter. She is an outsider when it comes to the group of housewives that meet often in the park where their children play. It seems that they all have a firm grip upon their roles in life, and that Sarah is the only one without innate direction.Sarah, on a dare, strikes up a conversation with ""The Prom King"" as he is dubbed by the group. He is Brad Adamson - expertly played by Patrick Wilson - who brings his young son to play in the park. Brad is studying for the bar and is supported by his extremely organized wife.After finding her husband in an extremely compromising situation - a really funny scene - Sarah devises a plan to get to know Brad much better. This leads to a passionate affair.Parallel to this story in the film is a look at the life of Ronnie J. McGorvey who is a convicted sex offender (indecent exposure) who has just returned to his mother's home after being in prison. Ronnie is played by Jackie Earle Haley who was nominated for an Academy Award in the Supporting Actor category. Haley has an interesting look about him and doesn't appear often in films or television, but his performances are usually impressive. Before this, he was probably best known for the role of Moocher in Breaking Away. Ronnie is a pitiful man with arrested social development who is doted upon and protected by his mother - beautifully portrayed by Phyllis Somerville.The connection between these parallel tales is provided by Larry Hedges, an acquaintance of Brad's, who is an ex-cop with a not so illustrious past. Larry has made it his goal to poster the entire town with warning pictures of Ronnie as well as keeping watch on his house and performing little acts of vandalism. Larry is aptly played by character actor Noah Emmerich who is equally adept at playing good guys and bad guys. In this tale, he's a tortured character who is both good and bad with a great deal if ""nut case"" added.All of this combines to create over two hours of superior entertainment during which the viewer can relish a wide variety of characters and some really, really good acting.",Little Children
114,pepekwa,not as good as you think,8,10 February 2008,"On paper this has everything going for it, Oscar nominations, awards left right and centre, a good cast, a well-written screenplay from a fine book. However, this movie disappoints me. Firstly, as many have commented, the narration/voice-over is completely unnecessary, it patronized me like I didn't know what was going on. Part of watching a film is drawing your own conclusions anyway. I'm amazed test audiences didn't want that to be removed. Secondly, although the principals acted their roles excellently, the film never flowed or gripped me like say American Beauty did or another relationship movie like Garden State. There was enough present in the movie for you to care about the characters but the scenes didn't flow seamlessly and there was a lack of suspense and drama at some very opportune times which i blame squarely at the foot of the director. The ending was also disappointing, not that I wanted or expected a happy ending but it left more questions than answers and in my view, it didn't tie things up neatly which most movies should at least try to do as this isn't the sort of film there's going to be a sequel to! Saying all this, it was still a watchable film(albeit a good 15minutes too long) and fans of the dysfunctional relationship genre won't be disapppointed.",Little Children
115,jackjack-2,Gross trash,3,21 May 2007,"This film went out of its way to appeal to the worst in everybody. For people who like raunchy films, they would be happy with this one. Except for Kathy Adamson, the cuckold wife played by Jennifer Connelly, the characters are all wackos, weirdos, sickos. or perverts. If Connelly had not received top billing, I wouldn't have touched this flick but her billing was a come on because she plays only a minor role.The fact that Kate Winslett shared top billing should have been a clue to how bad this flick would be. She is an unattractive cow and that fits her role in the movie, so unattractive her husband resorts to fantasies with internet porn stars. Yet as unattractive as she is, she lures Connelly's handsome but flaky husband into a relationship. This is what is so unreal about this film. Why would any sane man married to one of the most beautiful women on earth and who is a good wife, be even tempted by an Ugly Betty? The title ""Little Children"" probably was derived from the fact that Brad Hamilton, the unfaithful husband, and Winslett, meet in a park while each is taking their child there. Ironically,the title could be interpreted to mean that most of the adults in the picture act like little children.I struggled to give this picture 3 stars. But it is not sympathetic to perverts and shows that once a pervert, always a pervert. The ending is gruesome but unfortunately is not realistic. The ending is one of biggest flaws in the movie in that it is a failed effort to redeem the entire movie in that it attempts to show that sin does not pay. Unfortunately, the movie is so bad that it is doubtful anyone gets the message.",Little Children
116,amosduncan_2000,Don't bother suffering the Little Children,4,29 March 2007,"Made with a certain energy and snap; ""Little Children"" none the less feels by the numbers; these wistful suburban melodramas, savage but with a twist of redeeming compassion, seem to be somebody's idea of accessible middlebrow art, and they just keep bringing them on. Sexual obsession leads the characters astray, they are over-punished by a still repressed society, and we are left with a bit of ironic sentimentality. Something for everybody?Kate Winslett actually keeps the movie's head above water for about the first half; She has just about the right touch to draw us in to every scene. Yet we finally start asking why this beautiful and resourceful women ever got stuck with such a total moron, and why doesn't She just leave? I was also impressed by the actress who played the sexual deviant's Mother, who stood out in this small role. This forced alternating of cruelty and sentiment has really dominated our comedy, drama, and dramady for a long time. It's net effect is to freeze out the audience; to allow the audience to always feel safely above what's going on on the screen. It's a trend who's time has come to pass.",Little Children
117,bburns,"The good parts were great, but there was much that was bad",7,21 February 2007,"I am of two minds about ""Little Children"". On one hand, director Todd Field plays to the same strengths that made his previous film ""In the Bedroom"" a masterpiece. On the other hand, there was much that just rubbed me the wrong way.The main story is about suburban housewife Sarah (Kate Winslet), and the bond she forms with a handsome neighbor Brad, aka ""The Prom King"" (Patrick Wilson). They are both trapped in unhappy marriages: Sarah to an Internet porn addict (Greg Edelman) and Brad to Kathy (Jennifer Connelly). Although not there is not much about Sarah's marriage in the movie, Brad's marriage is given quite the in-depth analysis. Kathy makes documentaries for PBS, which fulfills her both creatively and financially, but that is not enough for her. Although she is loving and beautiful, she is also a control freak who won't let Brad own a cell phone and forces him to take the bar exam every year, even though he never passes. Eventually the bond between Brad and Sarah turns romantic (I would have given a spoiler alert, but the poster already gives this away).There is also a subplot about Ronnie McGorvey (Jackie Earle Haley), an emotionally stunted pedophile, the creepy bond he has with his mother (Phyllis Somerville), and the rogue ex-cop (Noah Emmerich) who is obsessed with him.Like ""In the Bedroom"", Field elicits great performances from all the actors. Winslet and Haley deserve their Oscar nominations. And Field gives us emotionally charged material about adultery, crime and revenge without pulling any punches or giving us the ending we expect.Unfortunately, Field takes his cue from Kathy's work and decides to make this film in the style of a PBS documentary. The shots are uniformly static and there is little background music. And he has even gone so far as to have third-person narration by Will Lyman, best known for his voice-overs for ""NOVA"" and ""Frontline"". The camera-work and narration I feel undercut the emotional impact of the story and the acting by keeping us at an ironic distance from the material.I also thought the ending to Brad's storyline--while unconventional--was a bit forced.But I was most disappointed by the fact that there was very little in this film that wasn't done better by other filmmakers. Sam Mendes (Winslet's husband) did a superior job of analyzing suburban angst in ""American Beauty"". David Lean did the better adulterers-who-can't-leave-their-families in ""Doctor Zhivago"". Alfred Hitchcock had a better take on the creep-and-his-mother dichotomy in ""Psycho"". Even the opening titles were an inferior retread of Robert Zemeckis' work in ""Back to the Future"".""Little Children"" is worth seeing for the strength of Todd Field's work with his actors and the compelling story. But the poor camera-work, narration, and unoriginality keep this film from being Field's best work. 7 out of 10.",Little Children
118,Monotreme02,At once darkly humorous and at once seriously dramatic,9,25 January 2007,"Field's directing is truly spectacular in the film. He is manipulative without ever invading the territory of showing off or having the film-making take away from the performances or the story  in my cases a film will have superb technical merits but average to mediocre story and acting  such is not so with Little Children, which remains technically and directorially brilliant without pushing these elements before acting and story. Sarah and Brad's affair, undoubtedly an improper, unfaithful and morally wrong ordeal, is filmed and the dialogue delivered in an innocent, almost childish manner. One of the most memorable scenes in the film involves the sex offender, Ronald, and his expedition to the public pool. I tell you, the way this scene is filmed makes it scarier than anything you would see in Jaws, as Ron swims around with a scuba mask amongst a pool crowded and packed to the rim with young children. Also utilizing Thomas Newman's brilliant score, Field manipulates the audience in just the right way to produce the optimal emotional response and specifically the optimal understanding of the film's various scenes, as in terms of tone the movie is extremely ambiguous and we the audience constantly find ourselves feeling something that would seem like a contradiction to the images on the screen. It is no accident, for example, that Ronald, the former sex offender is the most sympathetic and empathetic character in the entire film, and the two protagonists, Sarah and Brad, leave us cold, almost as if their affair derives from boredom and nothing more.In terms of cinematography, the film takes on a wonderful, almost fantastical imagery, which again serves as a dire contrast to its somewhat dark subject matter. As a continuation of this trend, the characters talk in an almost childish manner, and the narration is somewhat playful and even cute in nature. Field lights his sets with a very minimalist and soft lighting  cinematographically the film is very reminiscent of In the Bedroom. But what Field does best in terms of style is his use of composition. From the opening static close-up shots of porcelain figures and clocks we know we're in for an extremely interestingly set-up film  and indeed, we are treated to many very aesthetic and interestingly composed set-ups throughout the film, and in all, the film is gorgeously shot.It can't be denied, though, that probably the most evident and noticeable aspect of the film is its absolutely superb acting. Sure, the brilliant directing, witty writing and beautiful visual aesthetic all add to create a wonderful cinematic craft, but it is the amazing and superb cast who really raise the material just one more level upwards. Surely the most memorable and stand-out performance of the film is Kate Winslet, my personal favourite actress and one whom I see is really expanding her range and trying out new and adventurous things in recent years as opposed to the great number of costume and corset pieces (as wonderful as they all are)  these new ventures in turn bring some of the best roles of her career. And indeed, her performance as Sarah, the plainly put bored housewife who really has a lot more to offer to the world than simply staying home with her young daughter  a Master's degree in literature, clearly a higher level of intelligence from the other housewives  and yet, trapped in this world of mediocre, middle-class suburban America. It seems that out of desperation and boredom if nothing else does she pursue her lust for Brad. In her role, Winslet shows incredible range and skill, as her character really puts on a façade, although you can see her true feelings behind her eyes. It is truly an amazing performance. Patrick Wilson doesn't do too bad for himself either, although he certainly doesn't have quite as ""wow"" a role as Winslet. Jennifer Connelly in her small but fascinating supporting role as Brad's wife is absolutely spectacular  she really made quite an impression on me in such little screen time. Of course, this is one in a series of great roles she has under her belt, although she does tend to be a little hit-and-miss sometimes. But truly, the biggest and most incredible surprise of the film comes from a man named Jackie Earle Haley, who plays the convicted sex offender Ronald with such incredibly tragic sadness that we can't help but identify with him more than anyone else in the film. Clearly scared by seemingly never letting go from his mother, it's no surprise Ronald is attracted to children  he acts and talks like a child, due to a terrible and sad disconnection from anything decent or accepted. Haley, who was a child actor in the 70's and who hadn't done any acting since the early 90's, delivers a truly amazing performance that really left a lasting impression on me and caught me extremely by surprise.In all, Little Children is a wonderfully well crafted, impressively directed, sharply written, beautifully shot and superbly acted look at our modern society  at once darkly humorous and at once seriously dramatic. The characters are fascinating, and in all, the whole world Field creates is one we simply enjoy being in for the slightly-over-2-hour runtime. Kudos to Kate Winslet, for really breathing amazing, incredible life into the protagonist, Sarah, and to Jackie Earle Haley, whomever he may be, who delivers an extremely, impressively brilliant supporting performance that certainly came as a surprise for me. It's too bad that Field only has two films under his belt  he is certainly one of the most talented directors working today.",Little Children
119,samuelding85,The Children of Our Times,8,18 February 2007,"Little Children is a view of a small neighborhood through the social microscope.And some of the microorganisms found in the neighborhood are: extra-marital affair, pedophile, homosexuality, clashes of the conservative and the modern thoughts. All this and more are found in the small neighborhood.Director Todd Field explores extra-marital affairs again after his highly acclaimed debut In The Bedroom. Using Tom Perrotta's novel of the same title, the story shows that at the end of the day, the characters are behaving and having the mentality of a children, even though they are adults.Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson plays Sarah and Brad, who are neighbors cum the couple under the limelight. Sarah had a unhappy marriage with her husband Richard, while Brad is a househusband, with his wife Kathy (Jennifer Connelly) as the breadwinner. They get to know each other in the neighborhood playground, which eventually ends up their frequent rendezvous with their kids in the public swimming pool. Their relationships has been in discreet, which slowly develops into sex in the laundry room.What scares the neighborhood was the release of Ronnie (Jackie Early Haley), a pedophile that was just released from the prison. While he was trying to turn over a new leaf, the unforgiving parent support group was there to condemn him, and wants to drive him out of the neighborhood.Little Children lives up its name of the title: Little Children. In the film, we could see that the characters are behaving like children: selfishness (from the couple in getting what they want), hostility and unforgiving (the neighborhood's attitude towards Ronnie), childish (for the hatred words on Ronnie's house) and experiencing something that he wants since he was a child (Brad was yearning to mixed around with the teenage skater boys).Connelly's role of Kathy was a disadvantage to her. Being the supporting actress, her existence does not seems to matter in the story. Sarah, Brad and Ronnie, on the other hand, was the main focus on the film. Sarah and Brad are finding needs from each other, where they could not get the needs from their spouse. Ronnie wants to change, but the unforgiving society puts him down. Winslet and Haley has been given a great space to explore their role, which gives them an Oscar nomination for Best Actress and Supporting Actor respectively.Field has improve greatly from In The Bedroom.

120,commandercool88,Textured Tragedy,9,30 March 2007,"'Little Children' is an intense and provocative drama that casts an unflinching eye on the world of desire, forbidden love, and judgement. Certainly one of the year's best films, the invasive 'Little Children' dares to be bold, and ultimately culminates into one hell of a film. Its payoff will bring you to your knees, overwhelmed and drained emotionally. Performances are Oscar-caliber all around, with sharp and intelligent direction from Todd Field. This one will leave you thinking.Sarah finds herself living in smalltown America, stuck in a crumbling marriage. She doesn't exactly fit in, constantly under scrutiny of other neighborhood wives. They spend their summer days in the parks with their children, which is where Sarah becomes acquainted with Brad, the neighborhood 'prom king'. It sets off a spark between the two, who both yearn for something new and different. The thought of a secret, forbidden love is enthralling, and it all boils over into a steamy affair. Meanwhile, a sex offender has just moved into the neighborhood, and is met with vindictive responses and angry protest. Is the man a monster, or are these people too quick to judge? Together these stories will run their course, but these lives are on a collision course.In what may be seen as the best satire of smalltown America since 'American Beauty', 'Little Children' is never dull. Its relentless approach never ceases to challenge its viewer, for it seamlessly moves from light-hearted humor to biting observations of society. It's an honest look at how we are so quick to condemn and criticize others that we don't realize the damaging results they may have, and rarely do we look inside ourselves at the error of our own ways. It's a very difficult film, but at the heart of this film is a mixture of tragedy and, somehow, hope.The growing sense of dread mounts during the film's final act, and at times it can be nearly unbearable. But it asks the question, where do we go once we've hit rock bottom? We pick ourselves up. What may be more difficult is picking yourself up after this movie. It can be so disturbing and haunting, it'll be on your mind long after its over. The sheer intensity of the final 30 minutes will keep you on the edge of your seat as the film's two different stories converge in a powerful climax. We become so emotionally immersed in the film, that we're all thrown for one jolt after the other. Terrifying, but beautifully crafted.Todd Field's presence is rarely felt throughout 'Little Children', which is a testament to his natural film-making ability. He puts the characters in place, and allows them to evolve on their own and grow as characters we can identify with. The events that follow feel so real and not forced at all, like we're watching a documentary rather than a movie with actors, sets, a script and director. It allows for an intimate connection between movie and viewer, backed up by terrific performances.Kate Winslet is, as always, brilliant. She carries herself with an air of finesse that whatever role she inhabits, she makes it her own. But Winslet has some competition, as Jackie Earle Haley delivers a powerhouse performance. His performance as the sex offender is so heartbreaking, we're not sure what to think. Is he a monster? Should we sympathize with him? The question is never really answered, but left for each individual audience member to decide. A very, very humane performance that's haunting and moving. Also delivering fine performances are Patrick Wilson, whose 'boy next door' charm is quickly forgotten when he embarks on the sultry affair with Winslet. Jennifer Connelly participates in a minor role, but nonetheless offers a fine performance.'Little Children' is a train wreck you can't look away from. It wraps its arms around you and refuses to let you go, smothering you in its web of intrigue and devastation. This extremely heavy film makes wry observations and uses piercing social commentary to elevate itself above generic drama, this is so much more. Adapted from the novel under the same name, Todd Field finds his stroke of brilliance, for 'Little Children' sneaks up behind you and has you experience one of the year's finest films that's so rich and layered. Quiet in its approach but chilling in its payoff, 'Little Children' is raw film-making at its finest.",Little Children
121,JackCerf,Self Control,6,5 November 2006,"Far from a satire, this is a vindication of middle class self-control and the subordination of desire to duty. What Sarah, Brad, Sarah's husband Dick, Larry the ex-cop and Ronnie the pedophile have in common is that they cannot or will not control their worst impulses. Dick glibly convinces himself that he shouldn't even try. Brad runs away from a career that is too hard for him without finding some other livelihood to help support his family. Larry loses his family because he won't accept the loss of his morally satisfying position as guardian of the community and, as he puts it ""drive a fork lift at Costco."" Sarah regards her child as an annoying distraction from her life of the mind. Ronnie -- well, that would be a spoiler. They all live by the 60s slogan ""if it feels good, do it,"" and they all live to regret having done it. None of them will accept adult responsibility, all are duly punished for their refusal to grow up, and all repudiate their irresponsible selves.Ronnie's repudiation is downright oedipal. Sarah's is meant to show us that she will now put her duties as mother front and center. As to Larry and Brad, the resolution is incomplete. It isn't clear whether Larry will now accept that seat on the forklift. It is even less clear whether Brad's wife will throw him out, as he deserves, or whether he will find his level (perhaps as a suburban cop) and live at it as man of the house.",Little Children

At the same time a strong-headed housewife Sarah Pierce (Kate Winslet) and a home dad Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson) start an affair. The setting is already upside down because in Brad's household he is at home with his little son when his wife makes a career and Sarah is nursing her daughter while her husband is working to bring the bread to the table. Sarah is tired of her stuck life and loveless marriage. Brad adores his beautiful wife (Jennifer Connelly) and their son but something seems to be missing. It is understanding. That both Sarah and Brad will receive from each other.The subject is heavy and makes you think. Is anybody really any better human being than the rest of us?

124,the_Poppuns,Loved it save the ending,9,2 May 2007,"I'm not going to spoil anything just suffice it to say I would have liked the other option. The other bad thing about this movie was that I had to wait to see it on DVD. Shame on New Line for not releasing it wide. And double shame for the bare bones DVD.What surprised me seeing it this late, was the praise that Jackie Earle Haley got. I mean he did a fine job but it was such a small role and Winslet and Wilson rocked this whole movie. (And their real life spouses must have hearts of gold.) So I thought that Haley was overrated while the other too were underrated. Especially poor Patrick. And with Kate, it's a shame because when you finally see a movie so far after the Oscars it makes you want to take a time machine go back and root against Helen Mirren.I think this movie is very true to life. The characters are real even though the movie has a cheekiness to it. It's intended though. I think most people have a hard time understanding why people cheat or why people seem so unimpressed with their own lives but this movie pretty much lays it out there. I guess in that way it's like America Beauty although I wasn't as impressed with that film. (Sorry Mr. Mendes, and right after I said that you must have a heart of gold.) It's not for people who are squeamish about sex scenes. But other than that I think most mature audience members would definitely be able to take something away from it.",Little Children
125,Manal1987,The Children of Society,8,3 June 2011,"Loved every minute of it! This is the kind of drama that takes you by the hand and pushes you into the story. Movies that delineate the dilemma of desires and dreams being hindered by social and real life restrictions always touch a chord in my heart. I don't see as movie about middle-age crisis or marital infidelity. Actually, it is more or less about breaking free... crossing all the red lines that confines a human adult in an increasingly small circle of social rules and obligations. The society that we strive so hard to fit in and be part of is the very superficial, cruel society that kills our very soul and cages us in. I loved that the story never justifies nor condemns. It just confronts you with the bare facts and you choose whatever you want to believe. In a sense, it never ends too; we are not told anything about Sarah and Brad cutting off their affair, and we don't know whether Ronnie was saved or not. It is like and endless story of our existence with the successes and the failures and the forbidden pleasures. I loved the narrating voice as well; it was like watching a movie an reading a fiction at the same time. Kate Winslet is as gorgeous and brilliant as usual. Patrick Wilson did his best, but I still can't see anything promising about him.",Little Children

This is a completely absorbing and tightly coiled suburban tale of 3 adults, the people who love them, the people they love and the effect they have on other people lives. It is microcosmic in scale but macro-cosmic in subtext and meaning.Kate Winslet and Jackie Earl Haley got rightly nominated for their performances here and Patrick Wilson got wrongly overlooked.This film is reminiscent of American BEAUTY in that it is excellently written, acted and rides a subversive streak from beginning to end. It doesn't have that Oscar winner's occasionally overt comedy, but it certainly shares it dark undertow of emotions and motivations.This is fantastic stuff for the adult side of you.",Little Children
127,segacs,Disjointed,5,6 November 2006,"The acting is terrific and the story sets up a lot of potentially compelling subplots. But, though we realise that these characters are all interconnected, the movie seems to treat them in a disjointed, sort of disconnected fashion. This is a movie that promises to reveal something profound - about human nature, about character, about the complexities of relationships and of people - but instead, it takes the easy way out. Just when it sets up these characters as well-rounded, it drops them, leaving the audience out in the cold. The impression I was left with at the end wasn't ""wow"" or ""interesting"" but just plain ""weird"". I had free passes to this, and am pretty glad I didn't pay for it.

128,varundelpiero,An intelligent and underrated film...,8,15 December 2008,"LITTLE CHILDREN serves as a reminder to filmmakers of what can be accomplished in a short run-time (of about 130 minutes). The character development, even of the secondary and tertiary characters, is simply superb and intelligent, and Todd Field's masterpiece is as close as you can get to reading a novel without actually reading; such is the masterful development and expansion.The story itself is a rather engrossing one, with two main plots that are well-constructed, with definitive beginnings, middles, and ends. Todd Field and 'co-writer' Tim Perrotta do fantastic jobs of getting the story across, but still maintain the characters as the focal points of the drama.The acting is also remarkable, as Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson put in solid shifts. To me, the real standout was Jackie Earle Haley, who portrays an awkward character with the kind of straightforward and unpretentious approach that the character deserves. His Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor was well warranted, as was Winslet's nomination for Best Lead Actress, as this is perhaps her best performance of her career to date. Jennifer Connelly and Noah Emmerich are also quite good in their minor roles. A special note should be made regarding the voice-over work done by Will Lyman: the smooth baritone narration allows for third-person observation and editorial, with a hint of dry humour and wit; unlike many voice-over narratives, this one is superb, and actually serves to enhance the movie.There is nothing really epic or breathtaking about LITTLE CHILDREN, as its brilliance lies in its simplicity, its presentation, and its portrayal. The writing is simply outstanding, as is the acting. 8/10. 3 stars (out of 4). Deserves a place in my Top 250, at around #217. Recommended.",Little Children

130,A_Roode,Thoreau had it right.,9,8 November 2006,"I was walking home the other evening having just watched this at the theatre. Two guys were ahead of me on the street and had just seen it as well. Not intending to listen in on their conversation ... I did anyway, *LOL*. One asked his friend what he thought about the movie and the second took a moment to think about it. His answer? ""Twisted man, too twisted!"" Thoreau wrote in Walden that ""the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation."" In 'Little Children,' we see that quiet desperation played out to full effect by desperate housewives, ex-cons and damaged loners. A deep study of loneliness, 'Little Children' is morally ambiguous and doesn't judge. It uses humour, it uses dread, and it is a film that is at times quirky, intelligent and ultimately fascinating.I liked a lot of things about this movie and in the week since I saw it, I've grown to like it more. Thematically it should have been a terrible downer: a collection of people who've all settled into what seems like the beginning of the end. They've married, started having kids and every single one of them wakes up in the morning with dread. ""Is this all that is left?"" They have become, or more importantly, believe that they have become completely purposeless in the next of a continuing doldrum of empty days. Eternity awaits and eternity is purposeless existential hell.What is remarkable about a film whose subject should be so bleak, is the warmth and humour within it. Characters in 'Little Children' reject the lack of purpose, the unhappiness and try to re-inject a passion for life that they once had. At its most extreme, the quest for passion and purpose is lead by Noah Emmerich -- certainly most of the humour comes from his character. Winslet, Wilson and Emmerich are all flawed (who isn't?) but sympathetic. And then there is Jackie Earle Haley.How difficult must it have been to play a convicted sex offender who is both repellent and *gasp* sympathetic? If you're Jackie Earle Haley and you are stealing a film away from bigger stars and you've got a great part, then apparently it isn't very hard at all. Creepy, potentially dangerous but also fairly benign and pitiable, Haley gives a much over-looked performance in what is quickly becoming a much over-looked film. He has given what I think is one of the best performances this year, and what is certainly the best performance of his entire career.'Little Children' is ""twisted man, too twisted"" but it is also very good and very compelling. Well worth the risk and extremely well paced. It was only after the film had ended that I noticed how long the film was. Completely engrossing, I recommend it highly.",Little Children
131,IRateFilms,Todd Hits one out of the Field.,9,3 December 2006,"Todd Field, director of the highly intelligent, and sensitively provocative In The Bedroom, has graced the lawns of suburbia with yet another fine look at your household civility gone awry. Little Children stars Patrick Wilson, who has already treaded on the fine lines of pedophilia in the overly colorful Hard Candy, and Kate Winslet who hasn't had a role this spot-on since her independent debut in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Fields main theme of the film is infidelity triggered by spousal unhappiness, but at the same time there is a smaller story of greater magnitude, about a recently released sex offender, that Field tackles as a side plot. Fields visionary perplexity is unmatched by any of the other films trying to show how the upper-middle class has the same type of dismay with themselves as anyone else. Little children, much like Todd Solondz's Happiness, brings out the sinful tendencies of its characters in the most subtle way, never exacerbating things without a pertinent need to do so.The film moves along quite smoothly, relying mostly on the main story carried partly by Jennifer Connelly, wife to the cheating Patrick Wilson, who's frigidness has driven him to Winslet. There is not much to say about Connelly's character other than Field's clear indication of shallowness within beautiful people. It was ironic that child actor Jackie Earl Haley played the recently released pedophile, but his struggle was never portrayed as childish in the least bit. Crossing over throughout each other are themes of parenting, and loss ambition, which interconnect throughout each characters existence. Fields complex, yet riveting screenplay shows that no matter how useless or uneventful our lives might seem, there is always something lurking on every corner, ready to engulf us in its rejuvenation.It is very clear that Fields screenplay is about children, and their influence in their parents lives. They seem to be such huge instigators in both the problems and solutions of their parents. Little Children is an intelligent play on people's dreams, and how they get sidetracked into an alternate happiness to substitute their unaccomplished goals. Little Children, unlike most of the movies to its likeness, leaves us with a feeling of hopefulness. There is a movement towards fulfillment and redemption that movies in this category always lack. Be sure to look out for this small feature, because when awards season comes around expect it to get a lot bigger.",Little Children

You watch the film and you know they have this hurt, this longing inside, that drives them to do what they do.

When Sarah and Brad are making out after the football game Larry doesn't say anything. Larry never saw Brad's wife? Noah Emmerich was really good.

Set in suburbia, where people drive to the train station, we don't actually see a train ever in the movie although one of the main characters is supposed to take the train but skips it for an adulterous affair. The Freudian connotation is obvious, but the funny thing is that the SOUND of a train is heard numerous times throughout the movie also symbolizing the desire to get away (and hop on a train). Also pay attention to the sound in the pool scenes, which makes fantastic use of the surround possibilities as do the classic scene with the numerous clocks and the scenes in the playground and ballpark. Quiet music is also used to underline subtle but poignant scenes instead of using a stupid pop song to spell out the message as is usually the case in modern movies... And last but not least the movies has the decency to know when it is time to be quiet and just observe. A movie that respects its viewers and gives you something to think about.",Little Children

No, every film does not require a happy ending. What Field gives the audience is almost no ending at all.Had I written the screenplay, I would have had something occur with the disconnected breadwinners of these two couples (Edelman and Connelly) while Winslet and Wilson tried to make their escape. Connelly's character caught on midway through the film as to what was happening with her less than studious husband. She could have had a more interesting reaction than to sic her straight-from-central-casting mother on the Prom King to keep him in check. Connelly's character comes across a controlling, semi-frigid shrew more than anything else. As a man, I pitied the slacker husband, though admittedly no one makes one marry anyone else in suburbia.

It is probably one of the most brilliantly conceived films I have ever seen. It is RIVETING, disturbing, multi-dimensional and even dangerous to say the very least. It is not violent so far (I am 3/4 of the way through it) but there is an emotional violence to it. It is very emotionally sexual although not generally so very physically explicit. It enraptured me from the very beginning. It is a rather long movie but you won't know where the time went. It even has, I thought, a little bit of a Rod Serling aspect to it as he dealt so often with social values, mores and how Vesuvian eruptions of a singular nature can undermine the social equilibrium of a community. The moral of the story: People you think you know are not necessarily what you think behind closed doors. One just never knows what goes on within relationships and the seemingly peaceful appearance of people's lives is just that often simply appearances. Amazing and great film. The director and screenplay are simply wonderful. The director, Todd Field (""In the Bedroom"" nominated for five Academy Awards in 2001). An important film not to be missed.p.s.

137,dragonshield,"So much potential, depressingly flat",6,28 April 2007,"I didn't have any high expectations about this movie. It does have a pretty high rating at IMDb, a rating of 7.9 so I thought it could be worth watching. Well, it is worth watching, it's decent, but it's not a masterpiece. I think I wouldn't watch it again immediately when I'd had the chance for it.We're starting off good, the movie and the story seems to be pretty interesting, the narration sounds original and the use of words in it makes it also pretty funny. How it describes situations and emotions is pretty intelligent. Sadly enough, this is all the movie pretty much provides. I mean, there is no higher point worth mentioning in the movie, everything's just almost annoyingly balanced throughout the movie. After all, I liked the movie, but it's just sad that I know it could have been much better.Kate Winslet does a very fine job in the role of Sarah Pierce, a woman who finds herself going through the same routines day by day, figuring out that her life is pretty much as boring as it can get. Another actor worth mentioning is Jackie Earle Haley who also manages his role surprisingly good. He just looks like he really is the character he's playing, it's just so realistically performed.The screenplay's good enough, though it could be better as well. It's still well written and it progresses itself to the last scenes pretty well. I just would have hoped for some fillings here and there, as now it can be a bit uninspiring and boring at places. It's like you find yourself telling ""Now c'mon, let's move along.. Yeah yeah yeah.."" Which is again very sad, as there is so much potential in the screenplay and also in the whole movie to be honest.Either way, it's a good film, a one worth watching. But when everything's in it is just this decent, that's all it manages: Decent. Nothing mind breaking, just decent. Like I said a couple of times earlier, it's just so sad to see a movie with this much potential to be so flat, lacking in the directing as well. A couple of better than decent role performances, but that's pretty much above decent as anything in it gets. Happily it's above average though.",Little Children

139,the-evil-cult,Good Film but its Theme is Mixed,9,14 July 2007,"After directing In The Bedroom, Todd Field now turns his attention to Little Children, a movie about adultery between housewife Sarah and law graduate Brad. Each is already married and each has a child. Sarah has a little girl and Brad has a little boy. The story not only looks at this adulterous relationship but also looks at a pedophile who has been released into the neighborhood.Sarah, a former university student who has a masters in English literature, speaks about the book Madame Bovary with friends. She says the book is about a woman who is trapped and rebels against the establishment. I have never read Madame Bovary but I think what is happening in the film is supposed to mirror what happened in the novel. Sarah is tired of her dull life and decides to break free by having sex with another man. Her husband even cheats on her but in a much more bizarre way as you'll see if you watch the movie. While Sarah has the affair with Brad it is clear that her daughter suffers. While Brad has the affair it is clear that the suspicious wife also suffers. What this tells me is that although you can rebel against social norms, by pursuing what it is you want you can also hurt other people. At the end, both Brad and Sarah decide not to continue with the affair and the narrator says that although people make mistakes and although people have bad pasts, it's the future that matters. Running side by side with the story of adultery is the experience of a pedophile named Ronald. The pedophile in this story is not depicted as some monster but just as an ordinary person (for most parts of the movie, at least). An ex-policeman named Larry has started a hate group that harasses Ronald. They go around spreading fliers, telling everyone that a pedophile is living among them. This creates a moral panic and as this moral panic is stirring throughout the community even Brad and Sarah conform to social norms and start fearing the evil pedophile. Larry is no saint himself. He accidentally killed a kid in a mall and, as the story progresses, he ends up killing Ronald's mother.One of the things I noticed in the film is the hypocrisy of characters. Although Sarah is quick to judge and put down the pedophile at first because his perversion conflicts with social norms, her adultery too conflicts with social norms. This suggests that people may while conforming to social norms also rebel against it at the same time.One of the points I made before was how Sarah and Brad had the opportunity to right the wrongs. They were convinced that an affair was right but then decided against it. At the end, Ronald castrates himself, signaling a desire to conform to social norms. Larry, who once said that perverts like Ronald should be castrated, tries to help Ronald by getting him to a hospital. So by hating pedophiles Larry at the beginning was upholding social norms and towards the end by helping the pedophile he is rebelling against it. This sequence differs from the experiences of Brad, Sarah, and Ronald who all rebel first and then end up conforming. But Larry's hatred of Larry could be interpreted as anti-social as many in the community start to tire of his extremism. He starts off as a man of hatred and turns into a man of compassion. Interpreted this way, Larry too starts off rebelling but in the end conforms.So what I got from the movie is the following: There is a conflict between the individual will and the will of society. Due to our psychological limitations we both rebel against social norms as well as uphold it, and the cognitive dissonance that results from this paradox can lead to tragic consequences.The movie is adapted from a book and with the translation from book to film came changes. In the book, the pedophile Ronald does not castrate himself but rather admits to the murder of a little girl. This was apparently removed from the film so the audience could have more sympathy with the character. I suspect Todd the director was trying to portray Ronald as less rebellious than he actually was and this completely goes against the spirit of Madame Bovary who believed in rallying against the establishment. The director then really gave this film a conservative makeover whereas the original novel was a lot more realist in theme.Kate Winslet plays as Sarah in this movie. Kate has played in many lesser-known movies after the blockbuster Titanic. Many of these post-Titanic films are films I have seen recently, such as Finding Neverland (not bad) and Quills (excellent).All in all, I enjoyed this movie a lot. I've been thinking about it for a long time but haven't fully understood everything. I suspect the director may have botched the job and changed the story too much during translation from book to film. By trying to make the story appealing to a cinema audience he may have destroyed any thematic consistency. Many people I speak to say the movie is just a satire on suburbia and marriage and that's it. (The sterility of suburbia: isn't that just so clichéd now?) According to them, this movie is about the imperfections in all of us. But all this suggests that there is an objective good and bad. What if perfection is imperfect or imperfection is perfect?",Little Children
140,polar24,A finely shot unrelenting take on the darker side of suburbia,8,7 February 2007,"Beneath the neatly groomed lawns and freshly painted weather-board manors, smiling playgroups and book-clubs, are dark and unsettling passions, carnal emotions that simmer under the surface. Todd Field has demonstrated with this film and his previous work, In The Bedroom that the binding power of (American) families can be both a prison and a release. He once again takes us on a tale of the dark side of suburbia that uncovers what suspicions and secrets we keep from our families and friends, with devastating consequences. Each character in Little Children has a dream. When their familial relations break down, each of the characters find emancipation in love, childhood dreams and liberation from their previous sins.The film highlights how family relations can have become stale and pedestrian for our two protagonists. Sarah is a woman who has never felt comfortable with the trivial gossip of housewives and domestic duties to self-serve her ambitious husband. She seeks an alternative to the in-and-outs of conservative, frivolous society. Brad is a man discovering that his reputation in the neighbourhood and at home exceeds him. As a result he is never able to enjoy himself in life, sentenced to a life of tenuous career-rising and responsibilities. Despite this, they dearly love their children and they they share similar dreams and mutual appreciation, developing into a hunger for love.The peripheral characters also support the theme of unfulfilled dreams and secrets. Brad's football buddy Larry is a man constantly living in a shadow and must atone for his mysterious sins. He desperately craves validation from the community and comes off as nothing but a schoolyard bully. The haunting Ronnie can be seen as the product of a class society where status is the means to an end. His character is severely lacking a purpose in life and is seen as tragically misunderstood. He remains predominantly silent during the film albeit splices of anger and despair lashing out at key points. Even so, he still communicates an amplitude of feelings. His ""money moments"" at the film's climax are both heroic and heartbreaking.On first hearing about the film adaptation, I became curious and went out to read Perotta's short novel in one sitting. While the book is very simple, one-dimensional in character development, and meager and superfluous in plot; the film is deep, guttural, sharp and almost satirical at times. The screenplay follows the story relatively closely, but the difference lies in Fields adaptation of the story and his fine directing. Like In The Bedroom, he relies on quiet, unflinching moments and effectively chooses not to clutter the film with much dialogue or extraneous noise. As a result, the performances are ruthless and unrelenting. Winslet in particular covers the gamut of emotions and reacts with naivety, conviction and sorrow. The only point I might make is that that as Perotta's novel was somewhat shallow , some of the story lines may seem the same way. However in defense, I felt that the story was for the most part held up satisfactorily by Field.The directing sheds a dark shadow over family life and idyllic suburban society, beautifully and scenically filmed in affluent upper Massachusetts and New York. Fields offers us a unique alternative in the way view this society; the film was superbly shot, crisply photographed with many scenes directed so sharply in a style that has distinguished Fields from other filmmakers.This is fine film, unique and refreshingly handled, unrelenting in subject and tone.

141,buzzbruin,A Brilliant if Emotionally univolving Film.,8,20 October 2006,"It suddenly dawned on me as my wife discussed the film after seeing it the arclite in Hollywierd that I was not emotionally involved with any of the characters in the film. I felt no empathy or sympathy for them nor(and this is always my acid test) did I care what happened to them. Yet Todd Field the movie maker produced a film so brilliant in its execution casting and trancending all of its story clichés, because he was able to fascinate me like a fly on the wall--that is, I was so deeply involved in WATCHING these creatures that the film blew by. Unlike deeply emotional fims like How to recognize your saints or half-nelson he violated my rules of caring etc. He is such a brilliant craftsman that he caught me in a trap which I could not flee from!! One of the reasons I so love film as a drama and art form, is the brilliance of contrasting styles by everyone from Scorces to the independent writer directors. This a straight forward telling of a group of 30 somethings and their lives. The greatness of small lovingly made ""indies"" is if they are good, they drop you into the middle of lives, and you feel instantly at home with the people. I urge you to see this film made by the artist who made in the Bedroom for its sheer genius in movie-making. What a great experience of a brilliantly observing Artist at work in the fields of film.",Little Children
142,j_graves68,...Not in Front of the Children !,7,14 October 2006,"A release that I had looked forward to for almost a month after seeing the trailer in the theatre, it had finally hatched in October. Tom Perrotta's ""satirical"" 2004 novel had been released and I was able to finish reading it before the film's impending release. The film stars Kate Winslet (who, along with Guy Pearce, have both mastered the American accent in ennui), Academy Award-winning Jennifer Connelly (who unfortunately does not have enough screen time) and rising newcomer Patrick Wilson (destined to become the next Josh Lucas). The other comeback (and so many reviewers have mentioned him already) is the return of former teen heartthrob Jackie Earle Haley (""Breaking Away,"" ""The Bad News Bears"") as a parolee pedophile who is carefully insinuated in the film's climax. A redeeming endeavor on film involving such an un-redeeming character. The film is about two married suburbanites who are stay-at-home parents that embark on an affair (Winslet and Wilson) while their spouses are bringing home the bacon. Winslet's husband is already a pathetic sap whose addicted to internet porn, so it's not hard to empathize with Kate's endeavors (although the right thing for her would to up and leave him- but then that would be an entirely different movie). Wilson who is married to Connelly is different- because despite of how slightly emasculating she is on her husband, the woman is still likable. At the film's climax, Kate tells Patrick that their sneaking around is weird and she wants closure (which of course a lot of people in her position would want as well). Although in the book, her character never asserted herself like that. I also found myself comparing the film to the novel (which at times seemed over-written). There were subtle changes that were made due to time, budget and cinematic reasons, but the best change was of the ending as opposed to the book's. The book's ending was so contrived and implausible, Field did a superb job with coming up with something less anti-climatic and more shocking. This is one of those rarities in where you can honestly say that the film was better than the book. Another sequence that was excised from the movie that was in the book was the fact that Kathy had not only figured out that Brad was having an affair with Sarah, but she acted as if they were competing athletes and that he received the gold medal and she just got the silver instead, and that it wasn't fair to her. That too, was implausible and I was relieved that that was gone. In the book, Sarah (Winslet) was more needy and Kathy (Connelly) was producing a documentary about WWII vets rather than Desert Storm.My real complaint about this film (aside from the under-usage of Connelly) was the narrative voice-over that would present itself throughout the picture. Although it was well-written (taken verbatim from the novel at times), it was slightly distracting. It seemed to offer a perspective of the character's innermost feelings at times, but it also seemed as if the narrator was talking to the audience as if they were ""children,"" and it seemed unnecessary. But that is probably the desired effect here: with the narration, the viewer almost feels as if they are watching a psychology film studying infidelity with that borderline-baritone, ominous-sounding voice sequestering the characters and their actions from the audience. The narration did provide some comic relief for the audience though, whereas Todd Field's first film ""In the Bedroom"" did not. Field probably learned from that and proved with a vengeance that he could make a better film. I would not be surprised to see this film on the ballot around Oscar season: Kate Winslet truly deserves props for her performance (especially at the end where her character breaks down- you can sense the overall frustration that she has and her epiphany is spliced within her sobs). Jackie Earle Haley without any word said deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination, but I know because of the lack of publicity and the limited number of theatres this film venued at, there is little hope for a little film with ""little"" in its title that will really score big.",Little Children
143,MiloMindbender,"On par with ""Requiem for a Dream"" or ""Mullholland Drive"", a testament to the poor taste of the masses",3,14 October 2007,"I'm astounded by how many people have written glowing reviews for this. This movie, while not the worst I've ever seen, is extremely bad nonetheless. It starts off with an interesting idea perhaps, but most of the acting & all of the writing is terrible, not even remotely believable. Kate Winslet plays a housewife shunned by 3 other neighborhood wives, whose dialogue at the neighborhood park make them little more than cardboard cutouts. Add to that a caricature of a pedophile & a not even remotely believable nutcase of a former cop and you have your typical Hollywood portrayal of unrest in Suburbia. No, actually your typical satire of suburbia is better than this, at least there's at least one good joke. The writing in this movie is so contrived as to make anyone even remotely familiar with world cinema cringe. The infidels go back to their spouses, the cop & the pedophile kiss & make up....bleck!

144,Mancic2000,An extended episode of Desperate Housewives - yet another overrated Hollywood product,5,25 December 2008,"Okay...this is certainly not bad, at least as far asthe acting goes. But this is definitely not excellent, or anywhere close to a true 7.9 rating.The plot is not very interesting, certainly not creative nor well developed. At times it feels like the product of a desperate and artificial quest for sub-plots like the one about the paedophile and his mum in order just to fill out the 2-hour package. Character development is a bit shallow as we do not really know what constituted to and started the unhappy and dysfunctional marriages the lead characters were enduring. The part in which Patrick Wilson passionately invited Kate Winslet to run with him is just so......unconvincing that I could not help laughing out. The way the whole movie was structured and layered and the narratives which are highly reminiscent in content and style of a particular popular American TV series makes me think whether I was really watching an extended episode of Desperate Housewives! Okay...enough from me.I try to make a bold guess that most of the votes which have contributed to the strong rating of this movie largely came from an American audience. Sorry to say this but the truth is there are so many more higher quality movies better than this elsewhere than within the four corners of America, which indeed truly deserve this rating. Look further!",Little Children
145,peterlane5,Stunning,8,2 May 2010,"Loved it. Yes there a few parts that are 1 or 2 parts that I found a little disturbing and depressing. Through the movie I kept feeling sorry for Ronnie and I did cry when he did ""that"" to himself in the end. What I liked most about this movie was the character development especially Noah Emmerich's character Larry. It was really neat to see him going from absolutely hating and being disgusted by Ronnie to caring for him and finally feeling sorry for him. I went from hating Larry to liking him in the end. It had a few funny parts through Decalogue. I think the movie was perfectly cast. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson make a great on screen couple. Jakie Earle Haley does a great job at portraying a sex offender who can't help the way he is. I actually liked Earle's performance in this better than his other performance in Watchmen. Also Phyllis Somerville does an outstanding job as Ronnie's mother. If you are in the mood for a fantastic Drama this is it,but keep in mind that there are a few disturbing parts.",Little Children
146,he_who_leads,An Enaging Film with Focus,8,20 June 2007,"'Little Children' is one of those movies set in suburbia that explores men and women dealing with strained marriages, the politics of parenting, inertia, loneliness, fidelity/infidelity and dangers lurking beneath the surface. When not done well, films like this can appear to be overblown soap operas. When done right, like this one is, it is something to sink your teeth into and enjoy.Sarah (Winslet) and Brad (Patrick Wilson) are both one-child, stay-at-home parents with a lack of focus or drive in their lives and a lack of connection with their spouses. Sarah is more frustrated - unwilling to just have a healthy fantasy life like the the other park mothers, while Brad drifts around and broods. They use their children as an excuse to spends more and more time with each other. Both actors give very bold performances here, their characters' emotions radiate off their bodies even when they're not saying much. Winslet is particularly good, managing to give Sarah an earthy sensuality. Her character feels so trapped that her lust for a purposeful and happy life becomes a rebellion. Winslet makes Sarah so in touch with her emotional needs and gives her such a charged urgency that I found her alluring, something I haven't felt towards her in her past performances, through she's always been an attractive and extremely good actress.In the other story, a recently-released child sex offender (he exposed himself to some kids) named Ronnie (Jackie Earle Haley) tries to exist in a community that is being taught to fear him. Haley really shines in his role as a man acutely aware that his dark urges are wrong but is still in their grip. Haley is far more deserving of the supporting actor Oscar than Alan Arkin was, for his by-the-numbers 'Little Miss Sunshine' performance, but I guess they wanted to give him some sort of lifetime achievement recognition.The movie slowly, piece by piece, becomes more gripping as everyones' lives become more desperate and tangled. This is sort of like 'Desperate Housewives' except more mature and less quippy. The script and direction manage to maintain focus on what is important. A criticism I have heard of this movie is that Brad and Sarah's spouses (Jennifer Connelly and Greg Edelman) are not developed enough and only serve to justify the two leads. Even though this may be true (Sarah's husband is pretty much a cameo) I have mixed feelings on this. The filmmakers' clear intention was only to feature the spouses in a way that gives you an idea of the relationship they have with the main characters, and to further flesh out the main characters. In other words, less is more. While this may or may not have been fine, it is only the ending of the film where it becomes a relevant problem. The film ends for Sarah and Brad in a way that calls into question the exact state of their current marriages. Since the spouses are underwritten, the viewer is left with a bit of an empty feeling. We've come to know the characters very well, but the information isn't quite aligned with the questions the ending raises. Also the film shows its literary roots through its heavy reliance on a narrator at the start, which (don't worry) becomes rarer as the film progresses. Much of what the narrator says is unnecessary as the actors are often already doing such a great job acting out the narrated text.However, all this aside, 'Little Children' is clearly engaging, entertaining, carefully made and doesn't struggle to find things to say. I highly recommend it, if, like me, you're of those people who are constantly looking for something meaty in terms of acting, story and dramatic conflict.",Little Children
147,JCBar,Excellent - nothing much else to add,10,23 February 2007,"I thought this film was the best film I saw last year. While unsavory, unsettling, and disturbing (most times that combo is poison), I found its overall message one of redemption. The film is also suspenseful, thoughtful, and ultimately hopeful.The principle actors are all outstanding  Patrick Wilson in particular  but there is not much differentiation among them in quality. The film takes many turns, and just when you think you know where the scene is going, it changes, then you change your view, and then it changes again.And what I found especially good about the film was that with each different story that was on the screen (Sarah and Brad; Ronnie and his Mother; Larry and Brad etc), you were engrossed with that part of the story, and were able to somewhat forget about the other story lines  until you were jarred back to them, and then you had to realize that 'oh wait, we haven't resolved that issue yet'. and so on. I find that most films do not quite place you in that situation.In summary, a great, if somewhat unsettling movie, with great performances by each actor.",Little Children
148,gromit-17,Bored and Disappointed by this little movie,5,22 May 2007,"Can't believe this movie has such a high rating at the IMDb site. The book is one of my favorite readings from last year, and I have high hope for the movie, considering the track record of the director and the cast. But I was disappointed (and a little bored) by the movie. The biggest problem I found about this movie is the wishy-washy treatment of the characters and story line. I'm sure there were a lot of materials left on the cutting room floor because some story lines at the beginning of the movie (such as Sarah's husband, Richard ) were mysteriously disappeared at the end. According to the movie version (not the book version), the Ronnie character was allegedly exposing himself to minors, would that alone trigger the out of proportion reaction at the town pool? Will that alone justify the castration scene at the end of the movie? The summer affair between Sarah (Kate Winslet) and Brad (Patrick Wilson) was not out of boredom, but the director failed to show precisely what it was, and that made the last 15 minutes of the movie looked so unconvincing, choppy, and flat. It could have been a stronger movie to minimize the focus on Ronnie's story (not the point of the original story in the book anyway), and to show more dynamics between the three leads. Jennifer Connelly was under-used a background wife, Kate Winslet did an OK job but I found her performance toward the end was a little bizarre (but she's got nominated for an Oscar), Patrick Wilson was the weakest link, nice to look at but that's all to it. Lastly, the voice over of the man, who is the guy? And what's the relevance? Is it even necessary? Once again, another failure for movies based on good books.",Little Children

What would Little Children be without Jackie Earle Haley? The guy acts with every molecule of every cell in his being. I found myself biding time between his scenes, waiting for him to carry a torch.Overall, I can't say I was entirely enthralled by the story. It was very human and believable, but not compelling. There was no reaction by my fellow theater-goers at the film's conclusion. The ending was, for me, anti-climactic. It was as if the story had been written with plenty of passion, but an ending had to be engineered. So, what happened between Brad and his wife, between Sarah and her husband? And the little children, what became of them? Happiness ever after, I suppose.The rapid transformation of Larry from screaming maniac to nice guy was just too abrupt. Ronnie was the only character who had any kind of closure at the film's conclusion.My advice is to see the film simply for the Jackie Earle Haley influence.",Little Children
150,stefanbe,"Little Children is not a feature film for those who like action, but for those who like quiet moments that allow people to think about life.",9,5 July 2007,"The dark secrets of suburban has been explored before in the media, most notably in American Beauty and Desperate Housewives, but Little Children stands as the best of the bunch by actually managing to create a much more fascinating and realistic story. Todd Field, who previously shined with his debut feature In the Bedroom, collaborates this time with Little Children's author Tom Perrotta and they bring audiences a gripping motion picture. The talents of the impressive ensemble cast and the crew's technical achievements also make this adaptation a fantastic companion piece to an already wonderfully written novel.Kate Winslet plays Sarah Pierce, a bored housewife, who spends her days with her daughter at the playground with her annoying neighbours. Patrick Wilson is Brad, who is currently studying to try and pass the bar exam for the third time, but is continually distracted by a group of skate boarders on the way to the library. After Sarah and Brad share an innocent hug (and later kiss) in the park, they begin to see each other more often and soon begin a loving relationship. Meanwhile, a pedophile moves in with his mother after being put away for exposing himself to a minor. This launches a huge controversy in the town with the citizens worried about their child's safety. All of these plot threads lead to even darker series of events that spiral out of control for each important character. Just as the title itself suggests, they are all acting like ""little children.""Tom Perrotta's Little Children has been splendidly adapted to film with the script by Perrotta and Todd Field allowing these characters to easily jump off the novel's pages. Field's direction also contributes a splendid job with allowing us to take in all of the scenes appearing on the screen. The performances from the actors also deserve much praise for making these people believable. Kate Winslet, as usual, gives yet another award-worthy performance. She gives all of the ""desperate housewives"" on ABC a run for their money. Patrick Wilson has been heavily overlooked this award's season, which is highly unfortunate, because he does a splendid job here in a performance that should be getting more attention than it has been. Will Lyman, meanwhile, gives a film a unique and sarcastic narration that may be off-putting at first, but is soon able to blend well with the literary style of the film. The haunting score by Thomas Newman and the wonderfully beautiful cinematography by Antonio Calvache also add to the brilliance of this film. Little Children is not a feature film for those who like action, but for those who like quiet moments that allow people to think about life.",Little Children
151,forindcine,A sensitive subject filmed with style and grace,9,9 February 2007,"In August 2006 I recommended 'Little Miss Sunshine' an adult comedy with an elementary name. Today you are encouraged to experience 'Little Children', a film making reference to the young but its cinema - as adult as they come. The film is set in suburban Massachusetts, where young parents spend time with their lone offspring in parks or at the neighborhood pool. You have a stay-at-home father, (Patrick Wilson) caring for his young son while grappling with a domineering wife. You have a mother (Kate Winslet*) married to a guy so far removed that he disappears for much of the film. You then have a former cop forced into retirement after a terrible accident. Finally you get (Jackie Earle Haley) a recently released sex offender living in a community where his face is posted on every light pole and billboard in town. Just like in many stories about suburbia you get gossip, unhappy relationships, desperate housewives, house-husband and the not-so-welcoming book club. The real meat in this film is Haley who lives with his loving, aging mother while struggling to survive his demons coupled with a hostile community. He brings great depth and insight to the role of a convicted sex offender. Haley's Oscar nominated Best-Supporting role will astonish you as in one moment he is quite charming on a date yet in another moment you are horrified by him. Later, you stand with him in his difficult struggle. He is real, humane, complex and pained. The film provides an interesting look at his situation with not once condoning his past behavior. Little Children confronts a sensitive topic for many adults. But if you withhold judgment and let the film unfold you will no doubt have a broader viewpoint of this subject.",Little Children
152,K-nightt,Paraphilia NOS,6,11 December 2009,"Yippeee... I wanted to watch this film after reading positive reviews galore, in addition to the ""controversial subject matter"". What is seen is a barrage of clichés disguised by a different eggshell. Dissatisfied middle-class suburbanites looking for a way out of their self-imposed cage. The only ways out are to regress to primitive instincts, as wanting to be a skateboard-riding teenager or simply reinventing primordial lust. Now, the reasoning behind it I guess is still formulaic. Fetishism on the one hand (collecting odd items from some internet diva) and the hardened domineering wife-boss figure, symbolically castrating the jobless man of the house, ""reduced"" to a social mockery of the stay-at-home parent. The anti-hero, Mr Exhibitionist, is perhaps the one who needs to be focused on as the most human of all. Touted as a pedophile in the subtext (even though this is insanely untrue), he displays the utmost need to be seen in his ordinarily repressed sexuality.. this is why exhibitionists do what they do, they need their sexual organs to be noticed, and there is unbearable anxiety and distress if their impulses are not obeyed. The regression also extends to his oedipal ties with mommy. Now, everybody goes through conflict, and all is magically resolved. The killing of 2 birds with one stone comes with the washed-up ex-cop who killed a kid... in matters of pure instinctual survival drive, he manages to display reaction formation (loathing of the sexual offender when, deep down inside, perhaps he identified with him or had the wish to save him) as well as a fairy-tale chance to save the child-figure he murdered in the past (hence ""atoning"" his past errors), after the man cuts his own penis off, in a fantastic demonstration of a partial object coming to life and dying by a symbolic (and literal) detachment from the conflicted psyche. Of note, it is of a more pedophilic nature to lust after the childhood universe (even if it's in a veiled and nonsexual way), as the skateboarding scenario would suggest... it's called romantic pedophilia, and may certainly convert to a sexual kind... but these hypotheses are useless.. after all, all conflict needn't be faced head-on to simply disappear. But, of course, as American culture has time and again jammed down everyone's throat, nobody needs to have any deep realization about the root of their problems nor gain even the slightest insight, it's all a matter of some intangible force tapping them on their limbic system, and the self-contained story comes to a close with the happy ending preceding the closing credits, allowing us to believe nothing negative will derive from subsequent events.",Little Children

Every character plays a major or important role in the movie. The character I liked was of Brad to me he is reckless didn't take life seriously and ends in infidelity. So why the title ""Little Children"" the film focus on a guy (a pervert) played by Jackie Earle Haley who was released from the prison by committing a crime in front of a child anyways everyone in the town is scared of him that he might hurt their children in this way all the lives of characters somehow intervene. According to me what this movie really tells us is that its our children who need our attention, our love and affection, we should take care of them give them a happy and loving environment, despite of all the differences between us we should not destroy their childhood.And yes the ending was perfect and it couldn't be a better ending than this, So if you're looking for an adult drama movie this is the best choice for you.",Little Children
154,grandenchilada,A huge copout,8,16 October 2006,"A very smart, literary movie based on the novel by Tom Perrotta, Little Children surprised me by how dark and disturbing it is, how eager to make the audience feel uncomfortable; a welcome change from the usual lightheaded American fare. Its almost sadistic dissection of suburban hypocrisy seems to me a parable of a current greater national malaise, of the state of things under Bush. From the very beginning, the film sets up a toxic environment of frustrated housewives with fascistic inclinations, a wealthy suburban milieu rife with prejudice and barely repressed discontent. Nobody is capable of intimacy or connection, families are all surface, a sham. Gone are the days of decent neighbors and wholesome apple pies a la Lassie or My Three Sons. Now, the movie seems to say, America is a place of unfettered nastiness and sexual hysteria, and a place where people hide behind holier-than-thou attitudes that have nothing to do with being actually moral or humane. I was delighted to see such a savage skewering of closemindedness and hypocrisy. There are many uncanny parallels between the behaviors of some of the characters and the unholy mess of the Bush Administration. A former disgraced cop, excellently portrayed by Noah Emmerich, is the town bully, going beyond the call of duty and common sense, to harass and persecute a pedophile freshly released from jail. His over the top zeal is immediately suspect, an outlet for almost criminal behavior and misdirected wrath (ring any bells yet?) Of course one should loathe a pedophile, but it is so convenient to find a bogeyman, isn't it, and use him (Saddam Hussein, the War on Terror) to excuse all kinds of crap. The pedophile, creepily and wonderfully portrayed by Jackie Earle Haley (blast form the past: Moocher from Breaking Away -- I kept trying to place his very intense strangeness), is truly sick in the head and his behavior is disgusting and pathetic at the same time. You have to give credit to a movie that showers its greatest reserves of sympathy on such a terrible character. He seems (at times) more vulnerable and human than the monsters of self-involvement that people this community. The plot centers on the love affair between two frustrated married people, Kate Winslet, tightly wound up, and the very solid and very handsome Patrick Wilson. Although one can understand and even cheer on the reasons for their romance (she has a dull husband who prowls for internet porn, his wife coldly brings home the bacon and makes him feel like a failure), they are people with some unseemly traits. Again, this is evidence of a refreshing complexity and good writing rarely seen in American movies today. So all is coming up roses as I follow this movie's seemingly inexorable collision course with the destruction of lives. At last, I think, somebody is calling it like it is: America has become a monster. A bully. A liar. A place of deception and hypocrisy (not for the first time, but now it's worse than ever), where the most salient trait is hysterical smugness. So it came as an utter shock to me, almost as bitter as betrayal, that the writers, Perrotta adapting his own novel (which I haven't read) and the director Todd Field, decide to regale this tale with a huge dose of redemption at the end. Yes, hope is supposed to be a wonderful thing, yadda yadda, but I think it lets the audience and America off way easy. The ending killed me; one, because all the loose ends are tied way too neatly, thereby dispensing with the illusion that for once we are witnessing something that does not smell of movie clichés; and two, because this redemption strikes me as a false note. How can we believe in redemption when given the overwhelming evidence of malfeasance against them our leaders are not only unrepentant but doggedly staying the wrong course? Yet life goes on, the stock market soars, blood is spilled in Iraq every day and nobody seems to care enough. In reality, right now there is no redemption in America, no enlightenment, so why should there be easy absolution? While the movie nails the tone of the society in which we live today, the speedy turnaround of the characters and their unearned redemption are a copout.",Little Children

156,TwoCrude,The ending does NOT work,5,14 January 2007,"Having seen other films that depict modern life in suburbia, I rate this a five because of the ending. The story lines from the novel are nothing that anyone who works and/or lives in the 'burbs won't see every day.The town's reaction to the pederast was predictable. As was the blonde desperate housewife's reaction to Madame Bovary. The thing is, the ending (like a lot of movie endings lately) offers near nothing to me after two hours of watching so many of these unsympathetic characters mistreat and ignore each other. No, every film does not require a happy ending. What Field gives the audience is almost no ending at all.Had I written the screenplay, I would have had something occur with the disconnected breadwinners of these two couples (Edelman and Connelly) while Winslet and Wilson tried to make their escape. Connelly's character caught on midway through the film as to what was happening with her less than studious husband. She could have had a more interesting reaction than to sic her straight-from-central-casting mother on the Prom King to keep him in check. Connelly's character comes across a controlling, semi-frigid shrew more than anything else. I cringed in my seat during their scenes. As a man, I pitied the slacker husband, though admittedly no one makes one marry anyone else in suburbia. He would be better off single than with a woman like that.

I'm surprised other reviewers weren't insulted by the voice-over that literally spoon fed the plot, themes and conclusions to the audience as they happened. Talk about a spoiler? Why not just have a voice-over that spoils the whole movie and then I wouldn't have to watch it? God help us if we are required to think for ourselves! I've never heard a play-by-play announcement in a movie before and now I know why. Just awful. It appeared to me that someone loved the stereotypes found in the Haggis trash ""Crash"" and decided to make a ""Crash for Stupid people"" If that isn't redundant. God help me if I'm interpreting this film incorrectly, but I believe the moral ""as spelled out by the narrator"" is that pedophiles are just flawed people like the rest of us and we have all done bad things and act childishly at times in our lives. Are you kidding? Let me think...when was the last time I exposed myself to a child? Uh, NEVER! When was the last time I cheated on my wife? Uh, NEVER! When was the last time I decided to go skateboarding off a flight of stairs when, in fact, I can't skateboard. Uh, NEVER! When was the last time I shot a kid dead who was carrying an air pistol? Uh, NEVER! When was the last time I locked my kids in the bedroom so I could have a shag in the basement? Uh, NEVER! So exactly how is a pedophile the same as me? Very disappointed in the execution of this short story. At some point it became a very bad episode of Desperate Housewives. Perhaps the screenwriter had a spec script for that series and then decided to adapt it to the short story. Regardless, this is an awful film with questionable ethics and the classic ""Adults acting stupid"" answer to any drama. If you don't have a problem with inexplicable behavior then you might like this. If you actually like to think for yourself and interpret a movie ON YOUR OWN then avoid this like you would avoid the creepy psycho-sexual pedophile who is covered in blood and hanging around the swing set in the middle of the night. Whoever decided to have the beauties Winslet and Connelly in a movie but have scenes in which two middle aged MEN are playing with themselves really should have their head examined. Did it occur to them that the money shot is Connelly in a string bikini or tight dress? No? How many people want to watch a gross pedophile play with himself? I guess we do get to see Winslet in the buff but, jeez, to cast Jennifer Connelly and then not give me even a glimpse of her in the nude was insane. It's like letting Emmitt Smith block while Brett Farve tries to plow ahead for a three yard gain.I started out this review giving it a four star rating because Kate Winslet and Jen Connelly are exceptional, but have talked myself down to two stars.

Is this the only choice we have as parents whose marriage has become an empty husk? To uphold Family Values and stay in a loveless, empty, humiliating, indeed: dehumanizing marriage OR to, um: Betray our Helpless Offspring by an Irresponsible Flight into Adolescent Fantasies and the Great Unknown, leading to Certain Disaster? Tertium non datur?Faced with that sort of marriage, I opted to quit. But not with Mr. Young Hunk Next Door. We went through a fairly civilized divorce and the kid and I now share a flat with another woman. Mutual respect, support and kindness have returned to the household.

159,MalcolmJTaylor,Absolve your cinematic sins with this dramatic gem,10,9 January 2007,"If you're feeling a pang of guilt from indulging in cinema as diversion this holiday season with such stellar action hits as ""Casino Royale"" and the mind-bending ""Deja Vu,"" or the comedy-mockumentary sensation ""Borat,"" or even the Oscar-calibre thrill-ride of ""Blood Diamond,"" you may quickly absolve your cinematic sins by taking in the keenly observed drama, ""Little Children."" This film is a beacon in a crowded landscape of diversion signaling that rare gem: a film that reminds the viewer of all that is precious in life. This film is brave in ways that epics and loud special effect films can never be. This film dares to portray us as we actually are as people living and interacting on the micro-scale of daily life, and not as the people we fantasize about being.An outstanding achievement by director and writer Todd Field and a strong ensemble cast led by Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson. Watching this film one can't help but be struck both emotionally and intellectually. The director, actors and everyone involved in this film have taken great care to produce an honest and more importantly, an exceptionally brave piece of work.This film is a rare gem. See it as soon as you possibly can. Much like director Todd Field's previous achievement with, ""In the Bedroom,"" you will cherish ""Little Children"" for a long time to come.",Little Children
160,xander34,Deserves better,9,29 January 2007,"Little Children, the second film by actor-turned-director Todd Field, and adapted from the novel by Tom Perotta, has been treated extremely unfairly due to its limited release in America. It's been in theaters since early October, but only in January did it finally expand to about one hundred theaters. New Line Cinema has done a terrible job in distributing a brilliant, well received film, by releasing it with basically no promotion, and giving it an extremely minimal Oscar push. Yet it still receives three important nominations: Best Actress in a Leading Role for the always great Kate Winslet, Best Supporting Actor for Jackie Earle Haley (working for the first time in fourteen years), and Best Adapted Screenplay for Todd Field and Tom Perotta. Yet New Line still isn't expanding the theater count of the film and its doomed to an April DVD release devoid of any special features whatsoever.Like critic A.O. Scott from The New York Times has said about the film, it is incredibly ""hard to stop thinking about."" Todd Field has crafted a delicate, edgy suburban drama with some remarkable performances. Every actor holds their own so well that even the great Jennifer Connelly is overshadowed by the rest of the supporting cast. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson play the adulterous lead characters particularly convincingly, yet the supporting cast are the standouts here. Jackie Earle Haley deserves all the awards attention he is getting and more for his role as Ronnie J. McGorvey, a convicted sex offender. Noah Emmerich is fantastic as Larry, an ex-cop who has good intentions but comes across as a bully, and Phyllis Somerville is equally brilliant as May, Ronnie's elderly mother. While Haley is getting well deserved awards and nominations, Emmerich and Somervile have not received much recognition for their standout performancesField shows a lot of thought in his directing work, placing a large amount of symbolism throughout the film, a reason for repeat viewings. He paints the screen with a bright, intense visual style that gives the painful reality of the movie a satirical tone. Also aiding this tone is the use of a narrator, telling the story in a way that resembles a children's book. The narration takes a little time to get used to, but it only adds to the genius of Little Children. For instance, the narrator suddenly disappears when the character of Ronnie is introduced, allowing the audience to judge him themselves. The narrator reappears only as Ronnie's mother is introduced, when we know his character enough to judge him accurately. We come to realize that everyone in the story has considerable character flaws, yet Ronnie is the only individual who openly acknowledges them. Little Children is one of the best films of 2006, and deserves so much more attention than what it has received thus far.",Little Children
161,Delmare,"Takes ""dramedy"" to new levels",9,21 March 2007,"Fresh, witty, agonizing, original . . . another one of those gut-punching comedy-drama hybrids that manages to tell a more riveting story than either genre could aspire to on its own. Kate Winslet is magnificent. So is Jack Earle Haley. The cinematography is strong but unobtrusive. The music is sparse but compelling. The characters are original. The setting is realistic, almost terrifying in its quiet, hypocritical condescension. Best of all is the screenplay, which makes use of an ambiguous, third-person voice-over to goad the viewer into a kind of reversed-psychology. We resent the fact that we're sitting alone in the dark listening to a faceless presence connect the dots, and so (as if to prove to ourselves that we're capable of our own deductions) we find ourselves paying closer attention. Only then do we realize the full extent of the film's objective: the deconstruction of so-called adulthood, packaged in the ironic medium of a bedtime story. By the end of the movie, the children are the ultimate arbiters of right and wrong, and the storytelling medium, by its very nature, situates us in their POV. We watch, with youthful perspective, as the desperate adults become increasingly childlike. We love them as children might love, judge them as children might judge, forgive them as children forgive. ""Little Children"" is a spectacular movie, but one that falls a couple inches short of perfect, thanks to the screenplay's focused attempt to bill Sarah as a homely housewife. Though consistent with the novel's portrayal of the character, Winslet's almost unanimously lauded beauty makes it a tough pill to swallow. The movie would have faired better had the screenwriters accepted her attractiveness and built the story around her social awkwardness, rather than her lack of physical self-esteem.",Little Children
162,mjcfoxx,Are We All Little Children?,7,19 July 2013,"This movie is clever, funny, and disturbing, which is a set of adjectives usually reserved for really good horror movies. And let's face it: this is, in many ways, horror film. How many scenes within it manage to make your stomach churn? It's indignation at close-minded people is almost satirical. Everyone in this film has some sort of problem. The literary allusions are spot on, if you consider 'Crime and Punishment' or 'Madame Bovary', and its willingness to leave a few subplots open is something of a ham-fisted brilliance. Hard to look past its more disturbing moments, though. I'm surprised there's not a suicide somewhere in a dark corner of this film's vaguely promising yet contemplatively messy ending.",Little Children
163,cnewf,"very smart about Little Adults, with odd screw-ups",7,29 December 2006,"This movie does a wonderful job of representing the undertow of confusion and stuckness that threatens to pull people under. It cuts among interlocking stories that each center on someone who is about to dive down beneath their established life, and for entirely normal, believable reasons. 45 minutes into the film, all the main characters have thrown themselves into the vortex, creating the uneasy fear one feels for people who are about to risk everything they've deliberately built up in order to end a sense of suffocation that is much less concrete than the secure surface of their lives, but somehow more real. This is strong suspense film about that crucial question of whether or not our own happy lives actually make us feel alive.The movie covers an updated version of Cheever territory - the despair beneath the comforts of American suburbia. ""Little Children"" is better than ""American Beauty"" and ""The Ice Storm,"" and is intelligent about the effects of thwarted desire in the way of Todd Haynes's ""Safe."" It has the eerie disorientation of ""The Swimmerj"" It's particularly shrewd about the original source of romantic yearning itself. The film's real ""LIttle Children"" are the parents from two different families who fall in love with each other. They are the stay-at-home Mom and the Mr. Mom who re-marry each other informally at the neighborhood pool where they spend every summer day taking care of their adorable kids. Together they are as bland as they are in their actual marriage. Their interest in each other doesn't unearth some suppressed power or depth in themselves, which is always the assumption behind the affair. It reflects their mutual wish to recapture the unrestricted experience they associate with childhood - no bar exams, no dissertations to finish, no spouses with budgets or habits of Internet wankfests at the work computer. You can see the affair coming with the first encounter between these two fair-haired parents who are the bored and aimless and also subordinate to their focused and competent spouses in each of their marriages. Unlike the breadwinners, these two are still looking for what they want to do in life. When they seem to find that thing in their daily poolside parenting and then later in their daily sex, they are put by the film into strict parallel with their preschool kids sharing their afternoon naps. It's a nice dream - play and sleep, play and sleep, all feeling unforced and unchangingly attractive, every day happily the same. As if.The other true thing about the movie is that Sarah and Brad (Winsett and Wilson) resolve to run off together and then chicken out and chicken out accidentally-on-purpose, in ways that allow them to go ""home"" to their focused, successful spouses who are capable of taking care of them, and yet go home without acknowledging to themselves that this is what they really want. Sarah concocts a panic attack when her child wanders out of her sight for five minutes in the nighttime park where she had gone to meet Brad. Brad interrupts his trip to destiny to fulfill his wannabe skateboarder dreams, injuring his beautiful body and giving himself the perfect excuse never to try anything again. Lots and lots of us finally stand up for ourselves only to take this kind of dive right away, as soon as we decently can. One reason is that we stood up for the wrong thing, even though it took us forever to do so.So can the problems be overlooked? Well let's inventory them. The movie polarizes straight and sensitive suburbia in a phony way. The other moms are stereotypes of sexual repression, living on the edge of hysteria. When Brad and Sarah first kiss in front of them (on a jokey dare from Sarah), the moms grab up their kids and flee just as the neighborhood moms do later at the pool when the registered sex offender is found swimming around with a mask and snorkel. The same false polarity infects the original marriages: the dominant spouses are so disconnected from their partners that you wonder how they could have been married for even a few weeks: why would a phony, money-grubbing ""brander"" ever have married a failed English lit PhD student, or vice versa, and why would a smart documentary maker ever marry the pretty but super-dull Brad, whose soul can be filled through the camaraderie of night-league football? In the film's clunkiest moment, Ronnie, the sex offender, has a date with an attractive, clinically-depressed thirtysomething (played well by Jane Adams), bonds with her in a sympathetic, fraternal way, and then as she's praising their conversation in the car starts to jerk off and threaten her like a possessed maniac. The moment destroys the analogy between criminalized and ""normal"" perversion that had helped to humanize Ronnie (his mother is the film's strongest single character, played brilliantly by Phyllis Somerville). His auto-mutilation at the end just reproduces the suburban sexual hysteria the film supposedly critiques. Equally implausible is that his tormentor, the other unloved man, ex-cop and night-league loser Larry, turns into his rescuer: this is the kind of instant redemption that the basic intelligence of this film would rule out. The problem is the film undermines the quasi-heroic struggles of their flawed main characters - Ronnie, Brad, and Sarah - so that their weak and pathetic ends make the earlier dramas seem unreal in retrospect. If they fold THIS easily, then what were we watching the previous two hours.The men in this film - ouch. They are useless and dangerous by turns. The women are suffocated and unhappy. The American middle-class comes off badly - spoiled, unfocused, and without the strength to save itself or anybody else. We are, the movie says, the little children of world.",Little Children

It's a light film about adultery, and you care about everyone in the end . . . including the pedophile. In addition to the screenplay, the things that make this film are the narration - which comes across as if it's addressing children, the cinematography - which is mostly ambient light with lush shadows and highlights, and the performances of the entire cast all of which are flawless. There are a few shockers and more than a few laughs. It's a solid film that caries you through the spectrum of emotions and remains fresh after subsequent viewings.",Little Children

The characters are shallow and by the time the end rolls around, we are not really caring about them or what happens. Much of the sexual content was gratuitous. Trying to make an unsympathetic character sympathetic didn't work.Better to rent Bambi again and enjoy some real entertainment. I don't remember this movie hitting it ""big"" in the theaters, and no wonder. Who wants to sit in the dark watching people j-off in panavision?

Reading critics' and other viewers' comments both piqued my interest and made me somewhat skeptical - after all everyone loved ""Lost in Translation"" except me!Anyway, moving on. Little Children is definitely different right from the start. It is unapologetic in trying to make us laugh out loud and stop short with tremendous sadness in the same scene! No one is safe - there is NOT a single character in that movie that is a good person. The only close exception to it are Jennifer Connely's character and the old lady. However, interestingly enough, I found that both of their characters are shown to be strangely and intensely close to their sons. In Connely's instance this puts her at odds with her husband, in the second instance, it makes us wonder whether the son's ""mental disorder"" is due to his mom's overbearing nature! And is it only me, but is there hidden symbolism in the ""Hummel"" children figurines all over the mom's shelves - some with the most provocative poses!Brad is extremely selfish and ungrateful, and just like Sarah is absolutely unaware of the treasures he has. Both Sarah and Brad are treading dangerous waters the whole film until their bold and absolutely thoughtless actions lead to near disaster.Does it matter that they ""discover"" themselves and start appreciating others around them at the end? Well, not to me! The characters are so painfully cruel the whole film that at the end I had no sympathy for either of them. My heart only stopped because I thought those precious others will wound up getting really really hurt.And that is why I loved this movie! Go see it!",Little Children
168,cannonclubonline,Strikes a Powerful Cord In The Downtrodden Hearts & Souls,10,11 July 2010,"An unusually powerful narrative about normal feelings living in the heartland makes this film stand out as the ultimate winner of real life. There is nothing fake about this. The director Todd field captures the novel, written by Tom Perrotta with a zeal for true emotions. Although many could say that this film may have seemed overblown, most would agree that the film captures the psychotic nature of humanity through the lens of actual events that seem to always happen when social norms are questioned by self-righteous or self absorbed groups who band together to fight the so-called evils of western society. Although most would not blame themselves for being a certain way, this film highlights many hypocritical viewpoints about making the best of what they have. Living with the pain & agony of a miserable relationship or bad experiences (or even unacceptable behavior of people who made remorseful mistakes in the past) make this film stand above many others attempting to pinpoint the true essence of individuals realizing themselves. This is not a feel-good film as some might assert. To realize our failures as humans and try to correct them is the key to understanding this film. I would not even say this film was a satire to which is eroding at humanity's morals. I would happen to agree more with many who comment about this film that it teaches us not to judge since we most often don't understand the experience of walking alone with one pair of shoes into the desert. We couldn't possibly explain the loneliness of those that have been chastised & singled out because of being different.Perrota makes this perfectly clear by being an actor in his own screenplay by simply identifying himself in the credits as simply a small man. Maybe, no more or less than his persecuted character Ronnie J. McGorvey (Jackie Earle Haley) who is labeled in his community as a perverted sex offender. This film makes you think about others feelings and the ties of life & influence you have as a consequence of your actions. Our lives are fundamentally flawed at birth as we live and interact with others. It's too sad that most of our hopes & wishes are washed down the stream when we become trapped in our history.Whether the banality or sheer fear of life running its course, we seldom, if ever know what train wreck is around the corner. Perrota's narration lulls us into accepting that this may just be a boring children's story that will endlessly continue innocently, yet we most often see glimpses of 21st century life creeping in on us.Our despondent Ronnie reaches out to us with love and hate to expose our own attitudes. May (Phyllis Somerville), Ronnie's mother, gives a life time performance worthy of an Oscar. This representation of cancer (evil) within our midst is what makes us all become monsters. Understanding Ronnie drives us to feel love, sympathy, and hatred all in one. What makes it even more putrid is Larry Hedge's (Noah Emmerich) despicable behavior in light of all that we know is right. Will it be Ronnie or the two adulterers, Sarah (Kate Winslet) or Brad (Patrick Wilson) that we should make our object of blame? It's not really us to judge. In doing so, we become our own enemy. When do you draw the line? Fields puts us in the driver's seat whether we know it or not. Jennifer Connelly fits her role perfectly as well as all the other cast members. A must see for all conscientious adults who are wanting to make sense in their own time.",Little Children
169,why-pinto,Voice-over Narration is mental abuse,3,29 January 2008,"Aside from the fact that nothing actually happens in this film, and that all characters herein are cowards, Little Children is totally beaten into submission by the childish sing-song narration that fills in every crevice of thoughtful space created by what is shown. The viewer doesn't have to make a single mental move throughout, for as soon as you begin to think, The Voice pops in and tells you that ""so and so is unhappy and is looking for something else..."" as though you could never, ever fathom what a bunch of upper-middle class spoiled brats are feeling. You just aren't given the luxury to experience anything these people are supposedly going through. Nope, you've just got to sit there and take the horrific visuals on the chin and accept the childish writhing at face value while ""daddy voice"" tells you everything you need to know. I hate narration in film, and Little Children is Exhibit A as to why.",Little Children

All films are a gaggle of threads these days that collide in some dramatic denouement. This film is an example of how the process can become nothing but device. It's literally as though the authors forgot they had spent 2+h developing a story and characters. Ultimately, the ending is both unsatisfying, and disturbingly status quo affirming.There are also some preposterous things in this film. We are meant to believe that Jennifer Connelly is 'beautiful' but Kate Winslet is lesser? Sorry, that one does not come off.

171,conlaw,Jackie Earle Haley is outstanding!,10,21 October 2006,"Director Todd Field satirizes western society and exposes our fundamental flaw as a society. We are a country of self-righteous hypocrites who band together to crush evil wherever it may be found but overlook our own weaknesses.The story on one level is exceedingly banal: it shifts from scene to scene exposing the triviality of day to day life. Yet there is that haunting sound of an approaching train. Are we witnessing a train wreck? The brilliant use of a narrator lulls us into the belief that this is just a children's story and nothing bad will happen. Yet our eyes are glued to the screen as we await the crash.Jackie Earle Haley as Ronnie exposes everything that is wrong with our modern world and everything that is right about character acting. He gives a stand out performance definitely worthy of Oscar consideration. The character represents an unknown evil in our community, one that must be sought out and destroyed. His character at times is sympathetic, even lovable and other other times hideous and menacing.But who is more detestable? Is it Ronnie or is it those infinitely boring (but beautiful) adulterers, Sarah (Kate Winslet) or Brad (Patrick Wilson)? Is it up to us to judge? If we do, are we not being like the suburban community that is the metaphor for our society? In that way, Director Todd Fields includes us in the movie whether we know it or not. This is a wonderful (train) ride that will keep us talking for days. It is one of this year's great movies.",Little Children
172,naun,Mood piece,9,9 December 2006,"Little Children is an exceptional film about ordinary suburban people living lives of quiet desperation. It invites comparison with the best films in its genre, notably Ang Lee's The Ice Storm. But where Lee's film was a remarkable evocation of a time and place by an outsider, Todd Field's film is the work of someone who knows his territory from the inside.The film works superbly well even simply on the level of a mood piece. Field's camera captures unerringly the feel of public and private spaces in the suburbs: it registers with barometric precision the different degrees of intimacy afforded by the dining room, the study and the bedroom, or the way a change of weather can change the whole mood of an afternoon. The film also has its spectacular disruptions of mood. In one of the film's indelible images, the child molester Ronald McGorvey upends a lazy afternoon at the pool by swimming, bug-eyed and almost biologically amphibious, among the splashing crowds of children.Jackie Earle Haley's portrayal of McGorvey is arguably the most striking individual performance in a film that is notable as an ensemble piece. Where the Ronald McGorvey of Tom Perrotta's original novel was a coarsely drawn comic figure, Haley gives us a vulnerable monster, a sort of suburban Caliban. Haley's performance is one of many ways in which Field's film, like Lee's before him, transforms the caustic satire of its source material into something rather more intimate and sympathetic.McGorvey is the alien in this community. The other characters are figures we easily recognize, like Jennifer Connelly as the wife perpetually distracted by her roles of career woman and mother. But our identification with the characters isn't of the kind that vindicates either them or us. Rather, we share only too uncomfortably in their inadequacies and desperation. Noah Emmerich's embittered, self-justifying ex-policeman is another memorable creation, a kind of tragicomic counterpart to John Goodman's Vietnam vet in The Big Lebowski.Field's mastery of atmosphere especially allows the film to capture the mingled heat and ennui of the illicit love affair that is at the film's centre. The development and then the unravelling of the affair between the two participants, played with wit and conviction by Patrick Wilson and Kate Winslet, follows an arc that seems fateful without overbalancing into outright tragedy or farce, though it is piquantly tinged with both. The film's sensitivity to tone is of a piece with its unpleading empathy for its characters.The film falters a little toward the end, contriving to gather its strands into an apotheosis. The voice-over, until now ironical in its matter-of-factness, begins to cloy. What is it about American filmmakers that even the most sober of them go weak at the knees at the thought of moralistic ""redemption""? Earlier the film had been content to give its characters passing moments of quiet heartbreak and quiet consolation. Those moments outlast the resolution.",Little Children
173,clemtine,Even better than In The Bedroom.,10,28 May 2008,"A beautiful, thought-provoking masterpiece from director Todd Field. Like American Beauty, this film shows to us that suburban life is not always what it seems to be. It has a strong feminist tone and has very human male characters. It is about lives that are intertwined because of guilt and loneliness. This film is based on a novel by Tom Perotta and talks about topics like adultery and pedophilia. It is an examination of society as can be clearly seen in the playground and swimming pool scenes. The performances are almost flawless and should have bagged at least one Oscar. The cast was very well selected. I think this is far better than Field's previous undertaking, In The Bedroom, although that one was nominated for Best Picture. I personally have watched this one three times so far this year. The music is also pitch perfect. Each shot is so heavily coded in symbols.

Narrator was horrid and could certainly have been reconsidered or redone, less deadpan. He sounded like a male version of ""Desperate Housewives"" but not really pulling it off. This film also pretended to an insight it didn't really own and NONE of the characters were really likable. The film also relied on urban relationship myths quiet heavily, portraying them as gospel truth, and regularly founded flawed and unevolved insight on them, which was the real problem with this film. There are some highhanded hopes for in depth, truth revealing and crushing of delusions indicated in the direction of the early script but it's poor structure leaves the turning points under served, basically orphans.

Very flawed people, as we all are, being their worst selves, and only going down down down.. Felt bad for their children, and worse at the miserable ending.. where maybe one person has a chance at redeeming something in his past by helping another maybe stay alive since that mans act of ""trying to be better"" was irreversibly permanent.

178,coonyp,The book is better!,7,29 August 2007,"After watching the very good ""Election"", I sought out Perrotta's book and was a little disappointed. But I was intrigued with the author enough to listen to the audio version of ""Little Children"" not realizing it had been translated to the screen. I absolutely loved the book. Having watched the movie, I would have to say that in this case, the book wins.Since much of the book describes the thoughts and fantasies of a myriad of well drawn characters, it is difficult source material for the cinema. The narrative technique was an effort to overcome this difficulty. The other problem is confining the material to a two hour time frame. It would have been better as an HBO/Showtime mini-series. Maybe it still will be.I think Winslett captures the Sarah character perfectly but I thought the others were all miscast slightly. Brad needed to be taller, square-jawed - Jeff Daniels would be good. Ronnie needed to be more indolent, Kathy needed to be more dynamic, Larry should have been shorter, fatter (e.g. Peter Boyle in the 70's ""Joe""), Mary Ann needed to be an even more classically suburban prude, Ronnie's Mom is not nearly as small minded as her character needs to be.",Little Children
179,NoLittleLamb,A typical human struggle with an ending that was anything but typical.,6,17 June 2007,"Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson star in this film about the constant fight between temptation and duty. This film is a portrait of the never-ending human struggle to do what one knows is right while trying to resist the lure of rebellion.This film was full of fascinating characters that added many layers to the tale. Sarah the heart broken housewife, Brad the emasculated househusband, Larry the lost and confused ex-cop, and Ronnie the unreformed pedophile trying just trying to please his mother. I found all the actors to be very believable and they were able to convince me of the story they were telling. Kate Winslet was brought back to her Beautiful Creature days, certainly not anything like Rose from Titanic or that character in The Holiday. I also found Jackie Earle Haley the man who played Ronnie to be really creepy in a good way. Just as we began to feel bad for this social outcast, he turned out to be just as creepy as we were hoping he wasn't.There are so many words I could use to describe the ending of this film, powerful, shocking, disgusting, depressing, poetically justI was not at all expecting the violent ends to which Ronnie reacted to his mothers powerful words, I was sad that no one really got what they wanted out of life in the end, but mostly I enjoyed the hidden honorableness to the ending. While it may have been against their will, everyone ended up doing the right thing when it was all said and don. Sarah and Brain stayed with their spouses and their children, Larry got to be the hero he once was, and Ronnie did what he had to do to make sure that he would never hurt anyone again. The right thing was done, no matter how much it hurt.The whole movie had this weird narration, which I found to be rather annoying, but it added to the ""here are some characters in a book"" vibe which I think the movie was going for. There were also some sex scenes that I didn't find totally unnecessary, but I do think they took away from a potentially higher level of dignity and class that this movie could have had.This movie was very interesting to say the least. I prefer my movies to be slightly more upbeat, but this one was thoughtful and suspenseful enough to keep me enjoying it, and the hidden ""poetic justness"" of it all really made me like it even more.

181,TonesH,A disappointingly average film,4,14 February 2007,"Throughout this film we are presented with many people whose lives have gone in directions they may not have liked. Kate Winslet is married to a man whose primary interest is pornography, Patrick Wilson is married to a woman whose sole interest is their son, Jackie Earle Haley is a sexual deviant, and Noah Emmerich lost his position in the police force. Throughout the first hour and a half of this film we are shown how these people have the potential for change, and yet at the end we are presented with a confusing message, one that annuls the entirety of the film. I felt this was a film that tried to do what Magnolia did, in many ways, but failed. It is a film that is very forgetful.Let me first say that this film had some terrific performances; I was completely convinced by everyone, particularly Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson, who made a wonderful couple. The support cast, though great, didn't have a lot to work with, particularly Jennifer Connelly, who did well with what she had. The children were effective and very cute.I was also very impressed by the brave perspective Todd Field took towards sexual deviants who have served their time, showing that they are unduly victimised for almost the rest of their existence. In fact, the storyline between Ronnie and Larry, and the small offshoots, were the best part of the film, and very well done. The ending in particular was disturbing and wonderfully redemptive.I did however find many problems with this film. Firstly, there were some bizarre stylisitic features. Jarring the overall mood of the film were the parts at the start set in the park, which, though effective, was forgotten after the second scene. The entire setting wreaked of being a plot device after this happened, and I find that the monotony of being a wife in this neighbourhood could have been better shown. Furthermore, Kate Winslet was shown to be different to these women, and I found that this was somewhat weaved with her being an English Masters student, but this was a fact only used in one or two scenes, and then forgotten. Also, I had was with the bizarre comedy in the football sequences. Sometimes a serious film needs some brevity, but it was so out of place. I just didn't understand why it was used.The adultery in this film reminded me of In the Mood For Love in some ways, although in that film the neglectful spouses are not shown. But, like Magnolia, this film tries to give them a story, though both are forgotten about quickly. The film could easily have done without both characters. The same is true of the strange football referee. The only side-character that was of any worth was Ronnie's mother (and what a great performance from Phyllis Somerville).But, as was foreshadowed at the start, the ending was poorly constructed. Throughout the film it is continually showed to us the rut that these people are stuck in. We are shown time and time again the poor relationships Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson have with their spouses, and how their entire existence has become their children. Yet through each other they see themselves as beautiful, and their lives gain meaning. Neither had any drive to grow until the others came along. Then there was the reference to Madame Bovary, and we are shown in that scene how the self-destructive course that she takes makes her a powerful heroine of literature, despite all of her failings, because she dares to expand her horizons. And yet at the end of the film they come to the ""realisation"" that (in the instance of Kate Winslet) they have their commitments to their family, and (in the case of Patrick Wilson) he was just out for a rush. In the end the message was that the women at the start were right; that it's best to live for your children, and that Madame Bovary was a thrill-seeking slut. Though it may not make sense retrospectively, but this ending made the film at least half an hour too long. We could have come to this (rather dismal) point much earlier.Overall, however, it is a well made film that just didn't come together, and had an arch- conservative ending. Films like this need to be brave, and there's nothing cowardly to show that a person has a huge commitment to their family, but it just seems that no-one could think of a suitable ending for these characters, so they just sent them back to their families. A disappointingly average film.",Little Children
182,catalinignat,Live and appreciate,8,31 July 2009,"Interesting story, decent movie, did not make a stunning impression but it sure throws some questions about life and priorities. Although it did not manage to avoid cliché all the times, the story rises some feelings. Mine were not very pretty, as I thought the girl is crazy and the boy weak, so I wanted to shoot them both. But the feelings were there. Mrs. Winslet seems a bit artificial by trying too much to be real. The parallel story of freak couple is nice but invasive. Get your own movie! Still the end tag is great: start the future right now! So not a wasted time in the end, but a good feeling of appreciation of what we have.",Little Children
183,adsdmnel,Solid film and performances. Narration unsure?,7,7 June 2007,"After watching 'In the Bedroom' I thought that Hollywood had found an outstanding story teller in Todd Field. I could not wait to see this movie knowing he was involved again and Kate Winslet was on board, unfortunately I missed the film at the cinema, so thought i would read the novel. The novel by Tom Perrotta was outstanding and kept me hooked this only enhanced my wanting to watch this film.The film was solid, but not as tense as In the Bedroom.The acting was safe but there was no risk taking. Some people consider Kate's and Jackie's performances as outstanding but in my opinion they were good, but not Oscar worthy.They just did not shine enough as they seemed too predictable (hence safe).The main thing that surprised me was the use of Narration.I still do not know whether this hindered film or was useful! It felt to me at first that it took away the meaning from book and therefore did not enable the viewer to make their own interpretation of the themes conveyed from the novel.Overall a good film, Todd still shows flair behind the camera. performances were adequate but I just felt I wanted more.",Little Children
184,Jazmataz1980,What is this all about??,3,30 April 2007,"I cannot understand how this movie got awarded or nominated so many times...it is a very quiet little movie, nothing exciting, nothing new. The weakest part is the storyline: how do two adulterers and one child molester go together? What does one thing have to do with the other? The movie isn't too boring, and the actors make the movie enjoyable, but I wouldn't go as far as saying that this movie has something important to say. The epilogue puts some grandma's wisdom as a conclusion to all the flaws and also to all the hopes for the future of all characters displayed, but nothing in the movie suggests why we should hope for them to have a better life after all. Sarah is still married to a guy who sniffs panties of prostitutes, Brad is still a loser who rather sends his wife to work 12 hrs a day then make up his mind what exactly his professional talents are. And the child molester has only started yet- or do you really think castration and mommy's well meaning words ""Be a good boy"" change anything about that evil desire that haunts child abusers??? Pretty weak script. Pretty unimportant movie. Waste of my time- if it wasn't for Kate Winslet and Jennifer Conelly.",Little Children
185,ajsb55,A little masterpiece,7,30 September 2008,"I only wanted to see this movie at first because Kate Winslet was in it and I knew that she was nominated for an Oscar for her role. I didn't know anything that was going to happen and I didn't know what the story was basically about. I think this made it more enjoyable to see. Kate Winslet was great in her role and so was the sexual predator guy. I love movies like these that are similar to American Beauty and Revolutionary Road because its all about the neighborhood life and they add all this drama which makes it interesting. It was basically just the acting and the screenplay that was very good in this movie, but thats enough to make it amazing.",Little Children
186,jnunes-1,Baffling,3,5 January 2007,"I fully expected this movie to be great based on the build-up before I saw it. What I saw was a movie with remarkable inconsistencies (the voice over gives it a kind of Desperate Housewives feel). With that said, where is the character development? Winslet's husband is in maybe 3 scenes to establish that he's a jerk and is basically a cartoon character who conveniently disappears whenever the script doesn't need him. The two romantic leads are brainless dreamers. The movie flips back and forth between cynical observation of suburban life to material which seems to be outside the depth of the film. The treatment of the child molester character was pretty clumsy when compared to the Kevin Bacon movie the Woodsman. Foreshadowing in this film seems to consist of a character mentioning something may happen in one scene and in the next scene it does. I haven't been this bored at a so-called great art film since Magnolia.",Little Children
187,Drifteral99,a hybrid of a movie (slight spoiler),8,2 March 2009,"Blimey! this was a strange one. Set in affluent U.S. suburbia - California methinks - cos it's often sunny.Kate Winslet ( convincing as a Yank) plays a youngish Mother - bored with her child and her life...her husband...rich and successful is an avid follower of online porn. She despises the other mums in her peer group...materialistic and frankly - stupid.There is a spoken narrative, which is often disconcerting but works well here. Delivered dispassionately by an immaculately sounding west coast American...who injects doses of black humour. In fact I'm left wondering if this film is a hybrid. A black comedy and social commentary which delves human frailty and fickleness (?) There are a couple or three laugh out loud moments due to his deadpan delivery of inescapable, but quirky truths.The neighborhood resembles the American Dream. That is until a 'paedophile' moves in. He's actually 'just' a flasher but the reaction of the townsfolk is classic and understandable....if a touch over the top.Actually the actor they chose for this part is just the creepiest looking character and perfect for the role of....pervert. We actually see him in swimming trunks, mask and snorkel in the local pool - which is packed - and I felt decidedly queasy. For he's almost reptillian.I'll say little more. The plot revolves around an attraction between two bored , dissatisfied spouses. It's an 18 cert (I think) ...and there are some rumbustious sex scenes, nudity and some examples of male behaviour at the outer edges of acceptability - in fact two of 'em were gross. One scene in particular with the reptile like man quite shocked even me! No way to behave on a first date. An almost overwhelmingly sad experience for anyone with a heart, morals and empathy. A boorish man would laugh no doubt - thankfully I'm not boorish.The story unfolds quite exquisitely and culminates in a tense finale, where vulnerability - and folly - are exposed as one of the characters you care most about is placed in harms way. Clue in the title.All in all this was a very good film but will not appeal to everyone.I rate it an eight - which is very high for me.",Little Children
188,ColtSeavers,Impressive,9,4 March 2008,"This is a movie for people (like me) who liked American Beauty, as well as Magnolia. Like these two, it plays in US suburbia and - beneath the surface - deals with pretty existential topics. Overall, Little Children is rougher than American Beauty. Its atmosphere is darker, more desperate, there is less comedy. Little Children is less ""artsy"", and it touches more unsettling issues, as exemplified by the creepy, and partly likable, pedophile who is so impressively incorporated by Healey (should have won the Oscar he was nominated for!), or by the lonesome, mentally ill woman he once dates. The brief but very explicit sex scene with the two main characters is also rough, very believable, and thus one of the best I have seen in years. When I first saw this movie I was disappointed by, actually felt fooled by, the abrupt and unexpected ending. When I saw it a second time, I came to appreciate the ending as an important component: For a long time, Little Children seems to argue in favor of unconditional self-liberation (like American Beauty). But in the end, its characters are abruptly confronted with reality, with their responsibilities as adults, and have to learn that their childhoods are over. In fact, like the narrator's voice did from the very beginning, the movie mocks all its characters (and probably most of its viewers) for being immature and childish. That's mean. Wonderfully mean.",Little Children
189,ddude1116,A fresh treat in a stale industry,10,3 April 2012,"This here is a film about the lives of suburbanites, which stretches their drama to the extent it can go, without it ever feeling old or used. Its cast is an ensemble, but its core is Sarah and Brad, played by Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson, and how they're trapped in marriages to unreceptive spouses and take refuge with one another. There is a subplot involving a sympathetic pedophile, and a broken man trying to regain his life, neither or which loses pitch in their portrayals. It lingers and develops properly, never cutting anything short, but with that being said, it is obvious how much thought went into the editing of this film. Each segment has gravity, having been toned down to the bare essentials. This film doesn't focus on the action, but the reaction. The story is told by a narrator, which is how we know what is going on, but the narrator sets up the scenes, and we watch everything build and unfold. I could tell you right now that at one time, Brad and Sarah go away for a weekend together, and while it is technically a spoiler, it is only an abridgment of a narration and would not spoil anything. The story is not essential, but is merely the stage. This movie is probably a bit too long, but it doesn't feel it. It never misses a beat, unfolding smoothly and precisely before us. There was too much dialogue in this film, and not enough action, but like I said, that was not its intent. It's a testament to the filmmakers how they got away with it.",Little Children
190,dckennedy,Something amiss in suburbia,8,31 October 2006,"I just saw this new and engaging film from Todd Field and enjoyed it immensely. It lacks the taut simplicity of his In the Bedroom, and he sometimes has difficulty juggling all the characters and subplots. But in the end he manages to land his movie safely on the runway. Field is helped along by some outstanding ensemble acting, especially from Patrick Wilson, Kate Winslet, Noah Emmerich, and Jackie Earle Haley. Jennifer Connelly also does a credible job, although we don't see enough of her. The movie is based on Tom Perrotta's 2005 novel. Perrotta's earlier novels include the deadly-funny Election, turned into the wickedly funny movie of the same name with Reese Witherspoon and Matthew Broderick.Some reviewers were reminded of American Beauty, but Field's film is much better written, directed, and acted, with a more humane and believable story line. The voice-overs at the beginning and the end are somewhat jarring, as if the movie is drawing too much attention to itself, instead of just being what it is. The subplot involving Ronnie (Haley) also threatens to unravel the movie at certain moments, but Field keeps his movie from skidding out in these danger zones.The emotional center of the story is Sarah Pierce (Winslet), and its temporal center is the evening when she has to talk about Madame Bovary at a women's book club in her apparently cozy suburban neighborhood. It's all too personal for her, and it's revelatory to watch her trite student-days understanding of Flaubert's novel give way to something more profound, a transformation not complete until almost the last scene. These scenes and the whole behavior of these thirty-somethings, not just their little ones, give their weight to the movie's name, Little Children. Only at the final time Sarah tries to buckle her daughter Lucy (Sadie Goldstein) into her child-safety seat does she succeed at last. Sarah is angry as never before, but Lucy has her complete attention as never before - and Lucy knows it, which is why she cooperates as she did not before. With her narrow child's view of the world, Lucy senses something amiss that the adults around her have a hard time seeing.Field's movie is an excellent addition to a year with a number of striking ""small"" or family-focused ensemble films such as Little Miss Sunshine. Winslet again shines ensemble-acting in the dysfunctional-family zone, as she did in Finding Neverland, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and Hamlet.Little Children is a reminder that life makes idiots out of all of us at some time or another. All of us, not just Ronnie, should try to be good boys and girls - or rather, good men and women.",Little Children
191,kipconlon,not....good,3,23 October 2006,"It is my fault, in some ways. I read the book, was not wild about it, but was curious enough to see the movie, as I thought so much of In The Bedroom, todd field's previous film, also an adaptation, and a really good one. So much of the power of that movie was unspoken, the power of cinema harnessed to bring a book to life. This movie relies much more heavily on novelistic conventions, including an unnecessary narrator that never fails to pull one right out of the small reality the movie provides. Even though this is a simple tale of the suburbs, no one and nothing seemed recognizable to this viewer, raised himself in a similar suburb. Unless you are one of the main characters, you are a one dimensional sketch, identified more by wardrobe than by behavior. You're also probably a jerk. If you are a main character, you are an unpredictable volcano of action, set in violent motion by whatever provocation the writer/filmmaker has handy. Not one of which rings true as cause-effect. The unearned climax of the movie seems a desperate lunge for substance and closure but scores only as nauseating on the one hand, and to let you know you'll be getting up to go soon on the other. The beautiful composition and photography underscores how little there is to otherwise pay attention to. I was happy to see the actor Jackie Earle Haley again, and he gives it his all.",Little Children
192,freefaller_03,American Beauty Redux,10,5 December 2006,"I saw this movie after hearing about Kate Winslet's ""Oscar-Worthy"" performance, and, of course, since it is an Oscar Season prestige picture. I have never read the novel it is based upon, nor did I know too much about the plot when I went into it. Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised.The main thing I found upon reflection was that this film seemed to echo some of the sentiments and observations posed by American Beauty, and some of the technique used to bring that masterpiece to the screen: interior monologue/voice-over narration; a dark satirical stance; the unlivable malaise (for some) of modern, middle-class, white suburbia. The only difference here is that while American Beauty attempted to examine these thoughts from several different standpoints (mother, father, daughter, son), this film zeroes in on what would be considered Lester Bernham's story arc, and develops it to accommodate each of the principle characters.To me, the theme of this movie is how we deal with our pasts and our futures. Each of the principle characters here are obsessed with living in the past: Kate Winslet's Sarah is an English Major with a degree who has tried to embrace the lifestyle of the suburban housewife, but to no avail: she has in essence ""trapped"" herself in her home, attempting to conform to an ideal pushed to the extreme. She doesn't fit in with the other mothers, nor does she want to. Her one ""escape"" is her study, filled with literature, that she attempts to analyze and study as if she were still in school.Patrick Wilson's Brad, ""The Prom King"", is a house-husband to a distant, if not totally emasculating wife, Kathy (Jennifer Connelly) who from his vantage point seems to care more about their young son than about him. This resonates even more when we learn that Brad's mother died when he was 15. Now, having failed his bar exam twice, he spends his nights watching local teenagers skateboard nearby.Noah Emmerich's Larry is an ex-cop, forced to retire after an unfortunate incident where he accidentally shot an unarmed teenager in public. Haunted by this, he tries to do whatever he can to feel like a cop again, including playing night football with a team of cops, and becoming fully-involved in a committee to force a former sex offender out of town.And finally, Jackie Earle Haley's Ronnie is the former sex offender, who has his face plastered up all over town to warn the parents of the neighborhood, who lives with his only defender, his overbearing mother (played beautifully by Phyllis Somerville), who still treats him like a child, a pattern Ronnie is only too happy to reciprocate. Though he tries to assimilate and rehabilitate, his habits surface again and again, even ruining a promising date with an equally-screwed-up woman.All these characters, whether intentionally or unintentionally, are haunted by their past, obsessed with re-claiming lifestyles long-gone (Sarah as intellectual, Brad as youth/vitality, Larry as cop, and Ronnie as young son). In my opinion, they are the ""Little Children"" of the title, unable or unwilling to grow up and accept their station in life, and the humble benefits therein. However, the ending is very optimistic, as each faces their own crisis that tests their adherence to these desires.All in all, this is one film that, like American Beauty, delivers. The acting is superb, the cinematography beautiful and often poignant (yes Poignant) at times, the writing clever and thought-provoking...this is one film not to be missed by anyone...of any age.Freefaller_03",Little Children
193,cinemaniac_x,An artificial suburban neighborhood and the rebellion against it,7,28 December 2010,"In suburbia, you live by the rules. Those who don't are alienated. We have seen this in films such as American Beauty and Revolutionary Road, whose characters struggle to reconcile the lives they live with the lives they had imagined, making choices that isolate them from their families and neighbors.Little Children contains similar themes of suburban discontent that unravels lives when it rises to the surface after the characters have tried to hide it for years. During a heat wave one summer, a small town is rocked by a dangerous love affair and by the return of a pedophile out of prison, events which break unwritten rules and force the town's inhabitants to reconsider their own lives and how they see others.Sarah (Kate Winslet) and Brad (Patrick Wilson), an unhappily married anthropologist and a stay-at-home dad, find mutual understanding in each other after they share a spontaneous kiss in the park. Sarah isn't as beautiful as his wife (Jennifer Connelly), Brad concedes, yet he finds something alluring in her. Sarah becomes the object of scrutiny and gossip among the other women, but she realizes that her own happiness is more important than conformity to societal expectations.In a contrived yet somewhat effective way, Sarah's struggles and choices are elucidated when she joins the neighborhood book club and reads Madame Bovary. At the discussion, Sarah defends Madame Bovary most vehemently, seeing in the character many of her own life's experiences: ""When I read it in grad school, Madame Bovary just seemed like a fool. She marries the wrong man, makes one foolish mistake after another; but when I read it this time, I just fell in love with her. She's trapped! She has a choice: she can either accept a life of misery or she can struggle against it. And she chooses to struggle."" With this, Sarah justifies her own struggle, seeing ""something beautiful and even heroic in her rebellion."" Yet the film focuses on more than Sarah's rebellion; it also follows the life of a pedophile, Ronnie (Jackie Earle Haley), after he is released from prison and moves back to the neighborhood. He is immediately ostracized from his neighbors; his property is vandalized, he receives insults, even death threats. His mother is all he has, and she tells Ronnie that he's a miracle – all humans are miracles because we live knowing that the people we love can be taken away from us at any time.All of the characters have something in common; as Sarah puts it, ""It's the hunger. The hunger for an alternative, and the refusal to accept a life of unhappiness."" Using flawed and restless characters, Little Children shows that almost all of the town's inhabitants have their own dark secrets that they would do anything to hide. But the nature of life in a small town is that you end up running into your demons no matter where you go.The highlight of the film is the ending, when the characters finally face these demons and the multiple story lines are linked. The ending is also one of the finest examples of catharsis in recent film. This emotional cleansing, set against the backdrop of an artificial suburban neighborhood and the rebellion against it, makes for an honest, sophisticated, and ultimately important film.",Little Children

Thus far each has been extraordinary. Little Children is a deceptively simple title for a multilayered story of adult relationships in their complexity and depth. Male and female archetypes are explored and while heroes and villains take turns within the same characters. Each person is flawed and yet each is uniquely sympathetic. Perhaps the title is derived from the fact that while adults stumble and struggle to find meaning in their lives, only the Little Children are innocent.",Little Children
195,dooglesdead,"Great themes and nice visuals, but just not what it could have been",7,23 January 2012,"I don't have any complex insight into the pros and cons of this movie, but as far as I remember I've never had such mixed feelings about a film, so these are my initial reactions.When the end credits rolled, my immediate feeling was 'wow!', not because the film was incredible (it's not) but because it is incredibly diverse. Right up until the last minutes the director switches between happy, melancholy, distressing, and relieving scenes. On the one hand it's impressive that this is done without distracting the viewer from the plot, but on the other it seems as though this is artistically lazy. The same can be said for the voice- overs, which appear too seldom to have anything but superficial meaning, and therefore seem like they were inserted to add the bits that the script missed! Other reviewers have also been spot on about the peripheral nature of all but the main four characters, and the speed at which the story resolves itself.Yes these are all flaws, but I still really enjoyed 'Little Children' for the unbridled and honest way the main themes of desire and adulthood/childhood are tackled. It's clear that this is where the most attention was placed in creating the film. Also, visually it's actually very good, and I found myself drawn into some scenes just by the visual style. All in all, not a film that you should expect to blow you away, and its potential was certainly not met fully, but its well worth watching for the different perspective on what people look for in relationships.",Little Children
196,Image-4,A serious Desperate Housewives,7,26 December 2006,"Little Children puts a somber tone and dark mood onto the same issues of suburban American life that Desperate Housewives treats every week with swift irony and dark humor. Personally, I think the TV show does the better job.That is not to say however, that Little Children is a bad movie. On the contrary, Todd Field (In the Bedroom) manages to very clearly expose the drama in each of the main characters life, their struggle, and their attitude towards their unhappiness. Sarah (Winslet) cannot be content with a life of a suburban housewife that she leads and is constantly reminded that she's in the wrong place by contrast with the rest of the Stepford wives which seem to blissfully enjoy their equally shallow lives. The fact that her husband's main interest is internet porn does not make things any better. Brad (Wilson) is the ""prom king"", a stay-home dad who after finishing law school is failing year after year the bar exam. Then there's Ronnie (Haley) recently released from prison for indecent exposure to children and Larry, the ex-cop turned vigilante.Sarah identifies with Madame Bovary and feels the need to struggle to get out of the perpetual misery of her marriage. Brad, unhappy with his life as well, seems the ideal vessel for her escape. However, Brad's history and current behaviour seem to have little in common: he rarely appears as the smart guy that finished law school. In fact he is more the jock that had to quit playing football and having fun much earlier than he wanted to.The ending of the movie is realistic. And unclear. It looks like the status quo wins against the two main characters, although Brad realizes he does have a good family. Sarah remains trapped in her life. Larry and Ronnie are the most changed out of this experience, but... will anything really change for anyone? I am not the kind to recommend a TV show over a good movie. But in this case, I feel that the TV show has the upper hand by hitting a better stride with its style and with getting its points across. See episodes 308-310 for dealing in a very similar matter with a child sex offender in a suburban community.",Little Children
197,RottenMoreno,"Strong, disturbing and most important: brilliant",9,8 April 2007,"2006 was an outstanding year for movies, few can deny that, we got our comedies, our horrors, our action packed films, and also, we got our dramas. I have always been a fan of strong drama films, so Little Children was a film that I was pretty sure I would like a lot. You just name a film with a strong screenplay and mind blowing performances and I'm in. As simple as that.Little Children accomplishes everything we can ask for in a drama, and it does it in a brilliant way, it's a film that definitely causes an impact in the audience, it makes them think about the characters and their actions, it makes them care, it makes them happy at times, angry at others and of course, sad too. There are times were the audience will certainly feel uncomfortable, but that is also an achievement in Little Children,it's shocking from the beginning to the last single scene.Once Little Children gets your attention, there's no way out. This is thanks to the outstanding screenplay by Todd Field (who also directed) and Tom Perrotta, which is just brilliant. Also (and this is the biggest highlight), the acting. Kate Winslet delivers once again a perfect performance proving that she simply is the best actress currently working. Another actor that deserves a praise is Patrick Wilson, a guy I gotta admit I had never seen before until this last year, in which he gave two of the best performances of 2006, one in Hard Candy and the other one in this one. Watch out for Patrick Wilson people! Because he is definitely going to be big.But what would Little Children be without Jackie Earle Haley? Haley was definitely the one who stole the movie with a disturbing performance that will make you shiver, truly one of the best acting we've seen in the last years.I only had one complain for Little Children and that was the ending. I won't say much about it, because I don't want to spoil the movie for you guys, the only thing I'll say, is that I felt like it all happened too quickly. Just like BAM! ...there goes the ending. Besides that, Little Children is a dramatic masterpiece that shocks, disturbs, and entertains with a brilliant screenplay; a film that cannot be missed by anyone, very recommended.",Little Children
198,rothx16,nothing new to add but an opinion,7,28 August 2007,"With almost 15000 opinions/votes for this film, I can't really add anything new but I have some thoughts just the same. What does it take to get an X-rating? I didn't understand the need for the graphic screwing in the movie, nor why the wife didn't put 2+2 together: her husband's not answering the phone when the kid ought to be taking his nap, so what's dad up to?! I found the film overlong; you're really waiting and waiting for the thing to come tumbling down and Kate Winslet's character's bubble to be burst; you know it has to happen and it starts to drag at that point. The part with the ""sexually oriented offender"" having his own little story was strange: I thought, why are they giving this little guy's story in all this? How strange! And his blind date experience really freaked me out. Totally creepy. His mom's part was well-acted; she really puts down the guy who feels it necessary to post her son's photo all over the neighborhood, pointing out his past to him, which instantly shames him. Wow; pretty strong stuff, if a bit convenient. How he didn't know about the guy being at the pool is beyond me; every mom & kid in town was there. Which brings up another oddity: the weather is always beautiful in this town, isn't it? Every day is spent in the park & at the pool; just not credible for me. Too, so the guy looks at (well, more than that, but still...) porn on the web; that makes it OK for mom to have an affair? Umm....not really. 2 wrongs don't make a right. We know nothing about this character, nor much about Jen Connelly's either. The comedy was interesting in an otherwise very serious film.",Little Children
199,jonnyabomb,Little Children: A Contained Epic,9,31 March 2009,"Nothing sparks controversy like child-abuse. Even in Her Majesty's prison service, the paedophile is considered the lowest of the low; the dirge to all that is wrong with contemporary humanity. Where I live, in the U.K., stories of sex-offenders moving in next door to schools are common-place. The national press enjoys a good witch-hunt because it echoes the voice of the people; a people who want to believe that the natural order of good versus evil is balanced in favour of the upstanding citizen. Little Children is therefore a brave movie; the paedophile in question is presented as a human-being with issues - a man who hates who he is and what he has done, yet knows that any form of redemption will come via a tough private sacrifice. This film teaches us that humanity can be recognised in even the most unlikely of places, and none more profound that the sex-offender who loves his mummy.Perhaps typical of American cinema, the bleakness of this film's ethos is played out against the backdrop of mundane suburbia; take a closer look and you might even see the odd picket-fence dotted around. Everyone seems to have a secret, a need for redemption - all except the paedophile, of course, who is absolved of such impossibility right up until the movie's climax. Winslet's character is presented as a justly tragic figure - the epitome of wrecked dreams and misplaced innocence. At times, when given the task of caring for her daughter, she appears almost incapable of accepting her responsibility; she never wanted these children, and was never meant to be a mother; it was yet one more stage in her descent into a tangled suburban nightmare.The direction is tight, focused and thoughtful. There is rarely a dull moment, yet the sense of disquiet that the film produces is palpable. A fantastic piece of modern cinema.Thanks for reading.",Little Children
200,axlgarland,Perversely Yours,10,17 February 2007,"Bedrooms still play an important part in Todd Field universe but this time there is an outing, intellectual and emotional, that overwhelms in the apparent patina of familiarity. ""Little Children"" sizzles with an uncomfortable sense of impending doom. Kate Winslet, through her later day Madame Bovary, gives us a character that is recognisable and never seen before at the same time. Powerfully honest to the point of self destruction and yet, her feelings seem so clear and pure, so innocent. Kate Winslet in a superlative performance, invites us to believe that a human being can inhabit that contradiction without seem absurd. Patrick Wilson's courage without brains or vice versa is an uncomfortable pleasure to watch. Jennifer Connelly has one of the most chilling domestic moments I've seen in a long time: a moment of realisation at a dinner table. Contradictions, perhaps, are at the centre of this wonderfully conceived universe, Weary of domestic bliss. compassion for a child molester. Jack Earle Haley's psycho is not played for sympathy - he is a horrible character. He and his mother, the great Phyllis Somerville - are a realistic version of a Hitchcockian coupling.

201,jzll7,clear-eyed view of human beings,8,22 December 2006,"I saw this director's debut film, In The Bedroom, which was extraordinary, and wondered if he would be able to keep up such quality. This film is just as complex, full of human subtleties, and interesting turns. I hesitated to go see it because of the pedophile character, but this part of the story was well handled. There's a moralistic tone to the tale, but I didn't find this preachy at all - the viewpoint of the film is rather too detached for any judgments to be really heavy. This film is firmly in liberal-minded territory, giving every character a chance to express themselves, in various ways, and be understood.",Little Children
202,coradenice,A witty character satire,8,26 March 2007,"The film is a drama, but it hardly touches the sensitive cords of drama until its final scenes, and evidently in the parallel episodes involving the lives of the supporting characters. The relationship between Sarah and Brad is not sensitive, and it lacks that dramatic vibe of ""Madam Bovary's"", which is consistently referred to in the movie. How come? Because the two of them are not really in love. Their summer fling is just a form of escapism for two people who feel trapped for various reasons. Taken separately, each of them has all the reasons to feel miserable about their lives and to earn our sympathy. Nevertheless, together, they both appear like absent-minded, insubstantial children trying to reinvent themselves and seeing each other as a projection of their own, egocentric needs. Each of them is no more than a momentary solution meant to reinforce the other's self-image. I personally didn't see a deep connection between the clandestine lovers, they simply reached a point of profound dissatisfaction with their lives and with the lesser roles they played in their relationships, so they avoided responsibility and threw themselves into the adolescent dream of the forbidden. I'm not a moralist, not one bit, but had I seen true love between two grown-up people, willing to give up their petty, loveless lives in order to be together, then the film would have had a clearly different tone and it would have inspired different feelings in its viewer. Their relationship with their spouses, mainly Kathy's reaction when suspecting Brad's affair, lack the depth and intensity that would have otherwise delivered some sense of emotional liberation from their mockery of marriage, which would have led to an open confrontation between the adulterous and the cheated, restoring the truth. However, Kathy does not have the initiative to bring up the subject and ask for some definite answers, she simply contents herself to calling her mother and thus preventing her husband from continuing his cheating, and this sheds light on the relationship of forces and on the moral values existent in her marriage. So, the story of the two couples and their derivations becomes a witty, pertinent story of mores, yet a bit shallow since their feelings of failure and uselessness is disregarded in favor of satire. But then again, this was exactly Todd Field's intention, to minimize the dramas of immature, self-absorbed people and to help them regain substance as they awaken in the end, confronted with the things that really are essential in their lives and finally able to cope with them, when Brad is injured after skate-boarding with high-school students, and Sarah finally sees her daughter as a real person who needs her love. As I mentioned before, the supporting characters gave me the impression that they were the ones who had the real issues. The performances of Jackie Earle Haley and Phyllis Somerville were truly heartbreaking, as their characters, and Haley gave a stunning performance as a sleazy, yet very conflicted man who could not escape his sexual compulsion even if he desperately wanted that. The scene when he was in the car with his date and couldn't help masturbating is pretty shocking, revolting and saddening at the same time. Larry Hedges, very well portrayed by Noah Emmerich, is another complex character who does all the wrong things in order to have a sense of adjustment. All in all, the movie is well-scripted, well-acted, providing a comic, incisive insight into the social suffocation and pretenses of life in the suburbs. I maintain my opinion that the supporting characters were the most substantial and moving in the whole picture.",Little Children

BUt then I noticed Kate Winslett.The film seems like it can't decide what kind of film to be. As a film buff, I do get black comedy and to me, there was nothing black comedy about this film. There were some truly ""huh???"" parts, shifting from absurdism to drama to emotionally charged scenes of family relations put to the test.

Obviously, Children is much more graceful and poetic, as well as simply being better than Happiness. Still, though, the plot and character similarities are numerous: psycho-sexual disorder vs hyper sexual behavior, indecent exposure vs child molester, child neglect, spousal neglect, etc. Hell, even the young woman that the child molester, Ronny, goes on a blind date with is in Happiness. I realize that the styles are totally different, as Solondz is so satirical while Fields is a little more sympathetic and caring. Still, the two just seemed so much alike.

On one hand this environment and social life is formed by sub-urban inhabitants for their own comfort and on the other hand forming and limiting the world of them even against their wills.Sarah (Kate Winslet) appears as unsuccessful mother according to the criteria of neighbors. In the first scene of the film, accused to being ""bad mom"" even by her little daughter. But despite all this, she appears as a strong character. Her husband is a successful rich man, but not strong enough to control himself against online hookers. Brad (Patrick Wilson) is suffering to being a jobless husband. But in spite of many similar stories, he is not an alcoholic. His wife Kathy (Jennifer Connelly) is another strong character who is working, earning money and leading the family. Ronny has pedophilia syndrome and released from prison recently. He is under pressure of neighbors. This excessive pressure is creating obstacles for living a normal life and closing all the doors to being an ordinary healthy people. His only normal contact is, with his mother. Larry is an ex-policeman dismissed because of killing a boy accidentally. He is so aggressive due to post-traumatic syndromes. He is left by his wife because of his misbehaviors. Larry is another psychologically problematic and weak character of the film. Isn't it amazing that while all male characters are weak and problematic, all female characters are relatively strong and knows what to do. I think something wrong comparing with real life. The males in district are struggling hard in night rugby league together to feel that they are men. But if you are not man in your home, rugby cannot help to solve your problems.Characters are examined very well. The film is appearing really as a work of art, not an ordinary movie.

209,jamietalon,Stunning work of art.,7,30 March 2008,"What we have here is a very subtle approach in narrating the lives of two married couples and a middle-aged psychotic child molester who's still living under his mother's roof. What irks me a lot is the fact that most people won't learn to appreciate a film like this, god-dang-it, it's a MASTERPIECE I tell you! A very extraordinarily finespun Hollywood masterpiece. It just takes some soundness of mind, maturity and intellect to honor it as much as I'm doing now.The opening scene is very subtle as ever. The cinematography is so delicate, Kate Winslet delivers her unparalleled acting prowess, and director Todd Field applies a refined manner of direction. All in all, Little Children already blew me off my chair for its outstanding beauty portrayed in the first 5 minutes.The main focus is on Sarah Pierce (Kate Winslet) and Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson), two lovelorn parents who enters a hazardous extramarital affair. Sarah's married to a bastard who jacks off on a daily basis in front of a digital image of a promiscuous woman called ""Kinky Kelly,"" while Brad is married to Kathy (Jennifer Connelly), a too pre-occupied overachiever who writes for documentaries leaving him and their child at home, alone, wilting due to full-scale boredom.But a series of events interlinks the story of the illegal couple with the tale of Ronnie (Jackie Earle Haley), an ex-con who's charged with indecent exposure to children, living with his mother (Phyllis Somerville). The presence of Ronnie threatens the whole village, with Larry Hedges (Noah Emmerich), a retired cop, taking the stand against his unwanted residence in their vicinity.The situation grows tense. Suspicions arise. Goals were set. Plans and promises were broken. Secrets were blurted out. The truth and drama unravels itself.I love this movie even though I find some scenes very sick and in a sense, immoral. Some points were not made clear, but open for interpretation nonetheless. It reminds me a lot about the 2006's Academy Award Winner for Best Picture - Crash. The twists, the predicaments, the interrelated stories seems to be patterned from the latter. I'm not disparaging the film here, I'm comparing it with another awesome massive flick.Another great thing about this film is the award-winning performances. The scene where Kate Winslet's character is crying inside her vehicle is superb! The delivery of the ""cry-inside-the-car"" scene is beautifully executed, and Kate Winslet looks like she's not even trying! On the other hand, Patrick Wilson looks (and sounds) dull, but his performance is not that bad. His aura in the film is just too ""quiet,"" if you know what I mean. I can barely notice him, except for the scenes where, well, he's topless. I was seriously tempted to take a bite of his muscles.Jennifer Connelly does not have a big role in this one. And I'm seriously bitched-up for that. You can only see her for 30 minutes or so, doing her, um, thing. Jackie Earle Haley's portrayal of Ronnie gave him a big break in his career, his performance even gave him a nomination for an Academy Award. He made his character look so disgusting and at the same time, so ""lovable"". Now that's what I call a fine performance.This time, the young actors/actresses did not ruin the whole movie with their damn ear-splitting screams and murmurs. I praise Todd Field for giving these pricks minimal lines, even though I'm not aware if director Todd Field planned the 'minimal-lines thing' or not.The movie is SO great, for me at least. If you're not the philosophical type, skip this one then! You'll just end up wasting your time cringing, ""when will this movie end??!"" Go and stick with your slapstick comedies.

210,lumocolor,Satisfying,9,21 May 2007,"Comparisons to American Beauty are inevitable for this film. Curious happenings in suburban America, characters with secrets and hidden thoughts and desires, falling apart whilst trying to maintain a cover of coping with life as it is.It is a very well-shot film, the tone of everything is just right. Kate Winslet is excellent as usual and Patrick Wilson just gets better with each film he does. The supporting cast is also excellent, especially Jackie Earl Haley who lends the role of Ronnie a delicate balance of menace and pity. Always a pleasure to see Jane Adams play one of her mousy nervous characters too.Clocking in at over 2 hours, the film may seem a little long, and it does feel like a good 2 hours, but there aren't really any wasted scenes. The narrator used at the start of the film seems to taper off towards the end which seems a little odd. The use of it felt almost 'lazy' in a way - as if the filmmaker thought he couldn't get across the emotions of the character through acting or dialogue, so the audience had to have it spelled out to them.The ending of the film was a slight disappointment. I would have liked to have seen more crossover with the characters - to be honest I was expecting either Brad or Larry to walk into the playground and see Sarah and Lucy talking to Ronnie, misinterpret the situation and do something drastic. Or else Larry blamed Brad for the situation he'd got himself into, and so went and told Kathy what he'd seen on the football field. It felt like there needed to be more of an 'explosion'. But at the same time, the almost muted ending fitted with the tone of the rest of the film.In any case, highly recommended.",Little Children
211,gingerchen,Madame Bovary in USA,10,5 November 2007,"""Little Children"" is a half-cheering-and-half-depressing story. The writers set the whole tone and give out the clue of the ending through ""Madame Bovary discussion"" in the middle of the movie. Sarah and Brad, they are both like Madame Bovary. They are trapped in dull lives, but instead of accepting that, they fight to feel alive. Just, in the end, they failed, just like Madame Bovary. The writers express their opinions of this struggle through Sarah's viewpoint of Madame Bovary. Sarah said, Madame Bovary is ""trapped. She has a choice. She can either accept a life of misery or she can struggle against it. And she chooses to struggle."" Actually, at this time, Sarah is talking about herself. She is no more that grad school student, no more the one who thinks Madame Bovary is a fool and the writer is a misogynist. Life and time and experience turn her into a woman who can feel the same pain and desire Madame Bovary feels. She falls in love with Madame Bovary, because she realise she is her. These two women, they live in different times and societies, but they share something in common. And Sarah is not alone. Brad is just like her, and sure he is another Madame Bovary living in the 21st century's USA. That's why these two persons are so connected and so easy to fall into each other. They share the same kind of unhappiness and both are searching for the new possibility to feel alive again. Their struggles start with the kiss. The kiss is like the lightning appearing in the dark night, its brilliant spark suddenly lights up their long-dormant hearts. But it is still just a spark, it takes longer to see the flame. To Brad, picking up the football he had abandoned for 10 years is another thing filled with magic, which electrifies him so much. Football becomes another kiss. Like the narrator says, ""there were lots of excuses available to him. But it felt so good to be standing here beneath the bright lights. And he was filled with a feeling similar to the one he'd had right before kissing Sarah, like his world had cracked open to reveal a thrilling new possibility."" And for Sarah, only after her husband's ""Slutty Kay event"", she totally made up her mind to take some real action. And the key to the new world is that red swimming suit. When Sarah opened that catalog magazine, we can see that the page with the red swimming suit was already folded. That is the clue of the ambivalence she had before. To go or not to go, to run out of this dullness or not -Sarah had probably asked this question to herself many many times, and finally she made her decision- she was going, and she would put on that red armor to fight for her happiness in a new world. Sarah and Brad, they try so hard till they even decide to run away together. And they didn't make it. Back to the Bovary discussion, the writers already use Sarah's mouth to say, ""she (Madame Bovary) fails in the end, but there's something beautiful and even heroic in her rebellion. Do the writers try to say, there is no hope of this escaping; you can try but you will fail; you will fail in the 19th century's France, you will also fail in the 21st century's USA, and you will probably fail in other place at other time? Just, even though there is no hope, the process is still full of beautiful things, so worth a try. Is this what they try to say? Sarah and Brad end their trying before they really step outside their old worlds. Sarah was holding daughter Lucy, saying to her ""I'm sorry. Would you like to go home?"" Brad found there was no need for his ""good-bye letter"" to his wife Kathy, and he required, ""could you call my wife?"" Before they gave up, they both received some hints. Sarah had a little talk with Ronnie, and conversation is related to mommy's love to child. Then she looked like suddenly realising her daughter's situation or something. For Brad, he just won the football game; the victory made him so high; he finally got that feeling that life was back into his own hand and everything was possible for him. Since he felt that he ""can do anything"", why not try the skateboard, which he had been watching the kids playing for weeks. So it is, Brad took another try of new thing, but this time, he wasn't that lucky; he failed. Like being informed the oracle, they stepped back to their old worlds. Compared to the developing of Sarah's choice, the one of Brad is more poetic. The failing of the skateboarding can be easy taken as a sign of life's uncertainty. Sometime it gives you happy surprise, sometimes it brings you down. But I am not able to agree with the director about the Sarah's choice that much. Just because of the children, the parents should stay in their unhappiness? I don't think so. After all that long tense beautiful struggle, Sarah and Brad are back to where they started. They might be a little different from the ones a few months before, but how long the nutrition rooting from this escaping can last? Will they find another way out? Will they find a way to break down their old living systems? Will they...? We don't know. Will we...? We don't know.",Little Children

213,janis-zogots,thought provoking,8,2 December 2008,"I started watching this movie rather skeptical because of the storyteller who guides us through out the whole movie. It seemed useless when communicating simple relations, thoughts and emotions of characters. But as movie goes, the relations keep going more and more complex adding more and more characters and in the end it feels very reasonable to have some sort of commentator. The movie is rather complex, seven rather important characters in one movie is not seen everyday. When you think that the character is revealed completely you still find something new to reevaluate him/her. Each of them in their own way. Basically each of the main characters are met in a moment in their lives when they are not at the happiest moment, when everything has gone so far that you cannot continue not to do anything. Your emotions, life expectations, feelings etc have come to a degree you cannot ignore. Brad is unable to communicate his beautiful wife who is giving all her attention to their new born child. Sarah in search for her own time works as an aggressor against her closest ones. And they choose not to deal with the situation but rather escape in a dream land, in a land where you can try to forget the past and maybe try everything from the start. But what they are forgetting is the responsibility they have put on them selves what they have to deal with first of all. There are many ideas communicated besides the main one. ""there is a start for any changes"". No matter how good you realize (or intellectualize) the danger surrounding you, you are still vulnerable for irrational emotions when danger comes to your house. The irrational - whole village is expelling a member of society who once showed his genitals to children. Rather than dealing with this member, everybody fears him like a deadly infected one - place where calling people ""little children"" is appropriate.",Little Children
214,chipvd,A script Alan Ball could have done something with,5,30 June 2007,"The film really roped me in at the start with it's courage to take on that most heated of topics- Sex offenders released from custody into the unwelcome arms of the suburbs. However, this is not the subject most explored in the movie. WORD TO THE WISE- If you like movies where 'cheating on spouses' plays a prominent role in the storyline then this is your movie. Personally, this movie was an awakening for me to my disinterest in the 'cheating' storyline. Or, maybe there was too much of this film dedicated to the often-explored subject. This is only disappointing because there were so many other story lines in this movie that were ignored or flattened for the sake of a juicy Kate Winslet 'forbidden love' story. This movie could really have used an Alan Ball approach.Ball could have given an adaptation from Perotta's novel the American Beauty/Six Feet Under treatment. What I mean by this is he could have taken the obvious conclusions this writer and director came to and found more ambiguous, gray areas to explore. The resultant film of the collaboration of Field and Perrotta seems to say 'This is very sensitive material so let's not stray too far from convention. Oh, and most importantly let's make sure to have two people in unhappy marriages GET IT ON.' Flattened by this end result are the sex offender who lives with his mom and the ex-cop who stalks him. It almost seems like there wasn't enough time in an already long film to really say something interesting about any of the minor characters. As a result, the sex offender feels like a copy of a copy of Norman Bates (this time living with a mother on the brink of death- radical) and the ex-cop is just your typical bully who realizes by the end of the film how wrong he has been. The cheating couple's respective spouses are also largely ignored. And one of those people was played by JENNIFER CONNELY!

She has done yet another great job in this film as a suburban mother, Sarah, with a daughter and a husband that is obsessed with an internet fantasy website. Sarah is funny, serious, and just a pleasure to watch.

Lots of themeatic areas in this film are not included often enough in cinema, for instance this story does not attach to a clearly heroic protagonist. All the characters exist in a grey area, as purely dark or light personas are just as rare in life. Most of the less likable characters have clear merits and believable redemption.In my opinion, even the narration actually works well here to help expand the story as it comes to light.

In order to find that security, we turn to others - sometimes even when those others are our children. It is for the sake of security that we marry. And if the marriage does not comply, we look for alternatives. If we have guilt feelings, we try to find security by blaming someone for the very thing we are guilty of. If we had a bad childhood, we want to regain security by trying to be young again. We lately also try to find that security with anonymous people on the internet. Every day we want to hold on to somebody who can say: ""Come, I will make you feel safe."" We easily reject the person who betray us, but we ourselves easily betray all those around us.The moment we think that our security is under threat, we get hysterical and overreact. We get unrealistic and exaggerate to the point of being foolish. Yet the little security we do find in others - or think we find - is feeble and fragile. We can never be sure that the other person is a pillar of strength. We live in constant fear of something we cannot really define. And constantly we are aware of the need inside us that cannot be fulfilled. Eventually we are forced to make do with what little is available.

219,alexbeene,"""Children"" a deeper, more mature version of ""American Beauty""",9,16 August 2010,"Fueled by the mature themes of sexual hunger and personal depression, ""Little Children"" includes more diverse adult characters than the simplistic title would have one think.Director Todd Field's latest film carries a cast of award-worthy actors including Kate Winslet, Patrick Wilson, and Jackie Earle Haley on a journey into the dark side of American Suburbia. Winslet's character, Sarah Pierce, is alienated from other older women in her community because of her relentless unhappiness in settling down with a husband and child. Likewise, Wilson's character, Brad Adamson, dreams of recapturing his youth through everyday activity while finding someone who will cheer on his personal ambitions.Adamson and Pierce meet at a playground and form a friendship which develops into an affair. A community occurrence that bonds the two even more is the appearance of a recently released pedophile, Ronnie McGorvey, who is constantly antagonized by residents who never look to fully understand what type of a person he truly is. The audience realizes that Ronnie is nothing more than a child stuck in an older man's boy; child-like surroundings are not something that he desires sexually, but rather act as an environment for which he has a profound need.Both Field and writer Tom Perrotta bring these characters to life through an exquisite screenplay that captures the innocence of Sarah and Brad's relationship and the emotional wreck that is McGorvey. Thomas Newman's score carries a dark and seemingly unsympathetic tone that stresses the undeniable craving that each person has for something more, be it a more active and normal relationship with the world around him or her.The subtle irony that ""Little Children"" exposes so magnificently is the juvenile understanding of these supposedly well rounded adults. Much like two children who are forced to become friends on a playground because they know no other child there, Sarah and Brad are thrust into a relationship not out of a mutual love, but out of the fear that they are two individuals that are completely separated from the community around them. Todd Field's direction gives this film a visual clarity that allows the audience to fully take in the world that Sarah and Brad confront. One also realizes that their alienation is more of a personal one that has been established in their own minds; they are divided from others not because of dislike from a consensus, but rather, from a negative mentality common in children and teenagers. They believe that the entire world is against them, and yet, at the same time, embrace that belief.Winslet and Wilson deliver strong performances as an adulterous couple, but the true scene-stealer is Earle Haley, whose child-like portrayal of Ronnie is disturbingly convincing and truly heart-breaking. Much like films such as ""American Beauty,"" ""Little Children"" looks to expose the dark underlying needs in every person and does so brilliantly. With dramatic intensity and some perverse humor, this film is one of 2006's best.",Little Children
220,syarzhuk,"bad acting, writing, directing",5,5 September 2007,"the usage of narrator's voice was so stupid. pretty much every time the movie will get to showing real emotions, instead of trying to get the actors to play it, the director would choose to substitute the cold narrator's voice instead; most supporting characters were very one-dimensional; lots of goofs: a guy goes with his kid to another woman's house and the kid doesn't tell his mom for several months? a guy falls off a skateboard face down and all he gets is a few cuts? a 3-year old girl gets off a bucket swing? a guy with a snorkel goes way under water (try it and you will get a lungful of water)?Overall, I'd give this movie a 5 - only for Kate Winslet's performance. Without her, it would be a 2.",Little Children
221,BadBoy117007,The movie is better than the novel? No way!,10,23 December 2008,"A rare situation where the film is better than the novel, but this is probably because of the actors in the film. They really make their community believable and relatable to the audience. Jackie Earle Haley and Phyllis Summerville make the McGorvey's come to life and definitely take the spotlight away from Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson for most of the film.Jennifer Connelly is great as Patrick Wilson's wife Kathy (who isn't in the spotlight too much in Tom Perrotta's novel). She brings an actual character to Kathy and does great with the awkwardness of her and Brad's relationship as well as her relationship with her son Aaron.Kate Winslet's performance as Sarah shows every emotion possible for Tome Perrotta's unhappy housewife. Her relationship with Brad in the film is portrayed as one for the Academy (which is why she was nominated in 2007).This film, along with ""Children of Men,"" was very over-looked for both the Oscars and the Golden Globes in 2007 and it's very disappointing.

222,farshidk,a great drama about adults some of whom are like *little children*,9,7 March 2007,"I agree with the comments under ""Be a good boy"". I really liked this film and want to add a few points.""Little Children"" is a drama with sad, at times comical moments and perversions. It is a cross between ""American Beauty"" and ""Closer"" -- and then some. With interesting narration, it is about dysfunctional, broken and unfortunately often real characters and relationships, with several stories unfolding in parallel.It is full of interesting characters: an eerie sick pedophile who one somehow feels sorry for as he is at times like a kid himself (difficult role but very well-acted). A young handsome man who is a good father (married to Jennifer Connelly) but unambitious, and professionally and maritally a failure, who sometimes seems slow and acts like a child. Jennifer is a hard-working and dedicated mom. She looks almost anorexic but her beautiful face and green eyes are still a pleasure to look at. Kate Winslet (a mother married to a pervert) does a great job (and bares it all in a couple of good sex scenes. And a tormented ex-cup and bully who is not any better off than the pedophile, and needs serious help.It is a real and brave film. It may be uncomfortable at times but it is engaging. 130 minutes flew by in no time for me! I highly recommend it.",Little Children
223,hockeyrage88,"Not a masterpiece, but well done.",6,27 May 2007,"I hadn't seen this movie until it came out on DVD, and perhaps that is why I was a little disappointed. The only reason I even watched it at all was based on reviews from friends and bloggers about what an amazing film this is. So, it's possible that my expectations were just the opposite of those who had no idea what to expect.That been said, I have a couple problems with this picture. The first and foremost, is that I didn't care about any of the characters. I didn't necessarily care if any of them would have died, and in fact I was expecting one of the main characters to get killed. I felt the same after the ending of this movie as I did for Babel, because though I did see Babel in theaters, it was only after all of the Oscar buzz, and because of all that hype, I was disappointed by Babel as well- BUT, Little Children makes me appreciate Babel much more because I DID care about those characters. Babel explored both the GOOD and the BAD in all of its characters, whereas Little Children only explores the poor decisions its characters make, and what happens because of them. Of course, in the end, it shows that good people can make bad decisions and bad people can make good ones, but I feel let down being taken on this 2 1/2 hour journey simply to learn this fact. Babel takes this concept further and develops these decisions and how it relates to both those we love and those we've never even met.Maybe I missed something that I shouldn't have, but it seems that a movie that was indeed so well done and actually, well written, (the scenes with narration were possibly the most interesting of the film, which is probably not a good thing) truly forgot some very basic elements of storytelling. Just one person's opinion.",Little Children
224,6slick7,More than Desperate Housewives,8,11 November 2006,"There is an element of Desperate Housewives about this. It has a running commentary on proceedings and one of the intersecting story lines concerns a group of housewives escaping their mundane daily lives by fantasising about a guy who they only know as the Prom King. But the full picture is so much more than that. Sarah(Kate Winslet) and Brad(Patrick Wilson) develop a sexual relationship both because of a physical attraction and (moreover) in a bid to escape an ambitious wife who puts her career first and their child before everything else and a husband addicted to getting off on internet porn rather than showing his wife some affection. Another storyline is that of a paedophile Ronald(Jackie Earle Healy) just released from prison and causing tension and controversy by living in the locality. Watch for the scene where he takes a swim in the local pool where children are swimming and the rush of parents evacuating them as the notice who's in amongst them. There's also a disgraced former police officer trying to salvage his reputation by setting up a committee to rid the neighbourhood of Ronald. As the film progressed, I found myself laughing, covering my face during the ""cringe"" moments(both funny and serious), feeling a little aroused(for obvious reasons) and feeling sadness, dislike and sympathy as each character's story progressed. It is a film to take you through a full range of feelings and emotions. I found myself having parallel feelings of liking certain people and disliking others and this remained pretty much constant throughout, until, towards the end when the film gave me reason to feel sympathetic in some way for each and every character. This balanced everything out nicely in the end for me. Some have suggested that the film is a little too long. But I disagree. The decisions taken ultimately by my favourites Brad and Sarah made me expect and want more from them after the efforts made to escape their (from their perspective)disappointing home lives. This was the only thing I felt was incomplete about the film. If you like adult drama go see this. If subtle, offbeat humour makes you laugh go see this. If illicit romance floats your boat go see this. If one plot isn't enough and you like to see all characters and story lines in a film developed to some sort of conclusion go see this. It may not bee the best film you'll see this year, but it is definitely worth a look.",Little Children
225,ianjessup,Another must-see movie,8,27 February 2007,"Just caught this at the end of a run in Manly so I'm obviously a few months behind the rest of the amateur critics. If you like Tom Hanks and Ron Howard this is not your sort of movie. If you loved American Beauty and Mystic River then you can add this to that nice little collection. This is one of the most thought-provoking films I have seen for some time. You kept expecting the worst from the 'bad guy' but it never came, thank goodness - it would have trashed the film and deflected attention from the rest of the plots. All the characters reminded you of someone you know. There was a lot of 'real'ness about them. All those people who panned this film have obviously not spent much time at the local playground with yummy mummies who bore you with their small talk and constant self-obsession. Or they haven't wondered if the grass is greener on the other side. Or both. I found my emotions and thoughts being swept from one place to another as the various threads unfolded. The scene with the 'bad guy' on a date was brilliant and tossed your brain around like a tiny boat. Perhaps this movie was way too close to the bone for those people who didn't like it - then again, perhaps they're the sort of people featured in it. And for all the fears about what the 'bad guy' might do throughout the movie, who can honestly say they did not feel for him when his mum left him that haunting one-line note ? As it turns out, there is more than one 'bad guy' in this movie. It's everyone to a degree. Some people draw the line at varying degrees, hence our different takes on morality. So when the ex-cop does an about face at the end, maybe he truly did have an epiphany and realised he, too, had to change. Maybe this film was made too late to qualify for the Oscars the other day but if the 'bad guy' doesn't get nominated for best supporting actor then the whole thing is a farce. Go see it - even if it's on video or DVD. And be prepared to be honest afterwards. Many critics weren't.",Little Children

It left me feeling a bit as I did after seeing American Beauty. It seems that there are all these little dramas going on in the lives of Suburbanites in little communities from coast to coast and they are all fascinating on some level. The telling of these dramas on screen makes for very engrossing fare indeed-or, rather, it can if done right and Mr. Field seems to have gotten this one RIGHT! The performances were amazing and the only ""criticism"" I have is that Patrick Wilson is DISTURBINGLY attractive. I found myself completely as swept up in his physical appeal as the women at the playground. Indeed, whenever he is on screen (much like his performance in ""Angels in America"") I am completely distracted. I hope to be distracted much more in the future by this gorgeous guy!

While many deep and meaningful issues are ostensibly explored by ""Little Children"" - the loss of love, and lack of communication between husbands and wives, the tedium of life in suburban America, the difficulty of maintaining one's own inner life while raising children - the characters are so thinly drawn and so poorly developed that there is no emotional reality or logic to their actions. Thus, everything they do seems arbitrary, and merely willful on the part of the filmmaker, a kind of deus ex machina to serve the ""message"" of the movie. As the viewer, one is frequently shocked by the actions of the characters, but it is not the kind of shock associated with having seen deeper into the heart or soul of the character. Rather it is the kind of shock that occurs because the action seems to come out of nowhere, and is produced for its own sake - shock for shock's sake. In this sense, the actions in the film are as manipulative as are car-crashes in an action movie. Instead of the story arising from out of the characters, the characters have been cut and pasted to fit the demands of the story- board, and false notes abound.An unpleasant and un-meaningful film.",Little Children

It can mean but one thing: it is the director who is doing his job very well. The actors just understand what he wants of them and do it. Another accomplishment of the director is the presence of an almost permanent suspense in the film which of course is an ordinary trait for a suspense drama but it is not a suspense drama, it is a day-to-day drama. Of course, the story of a sexual maniac in the town is always present in the background but it is not decisive.

An unusual film; as a previous commenter mentioned, it's strange to consider this as a feel-good movie when it deals with marital infidelity.

Being a perfect husband or wife, conforming to those around you no matter how unfilled you may be. Longing for something else. These are the situations surrounding Sarah and Brad (Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson) both unsatisfied and let down by there partners and friends can they find solace in each other? Although completely different this film does have echos of American Beauty, the slightly comic narration, the intimate and personal portrayal of peoples private thoughts and feelings all add up to make this film very convincing and real. Raw and sad in some parts but lightened up in others with a simple humour that is found in everyones life from time to time. It's a hard film to place in a genre, it's not a chick flick or a comedy but it's romantic and funny, just a really good film to be enjoyed by anyone who's been in love.

239,theluke311,Fantastic.,10,3 March 2007,"Todd Field has directed something remarkable. I do not understand how this could have passed under so many radars. This film is a phenomenal observation on how we subconsciously long to interrupt the stagnation of our lives, and how forgiveness comes to us in so many ways. An affair erupts between two disenchanted suburbanites and ignites lost feelings of humanity within them both. They act recklessly and selfishly while keeping their encounters a secret under the veil of their children's friendship. Jennifer Connelly is particularly chilling during a scene at a dinner table with her husband and his true object of affection. The film does a detailed job of capturing the lengths of this relationship, from the initial interest, to the desperate attempts at ""accidental"" encounters, to the first sexual experience. All of it done tastefully and with metaphors of the relationship sprinkled throughout the film. Jackie Earle Haley plays a very subdued and real man struggling with his own deviant proclivities. His journey through the film is the one I found the most troubling, frustrating, and engaging. He does not play the character in a very theatrical way, which is a relief. Indeed, he did deserve an Oscar nomination for this role, as he played it in a way I had never seen before and was amazed to watch.

At times Field's direction drifts uncomfortably close to Alexander Payne-ian (to coin a phrase), but while Payne and Jim Taylor were able to render Perotta's oft-diffuse novel Election in an airtight and fantastic film, the Field-Perotta collab on Little Children fell a bit short. With some lazy decision-making as far as character focus goes, the movie starts to take on a rambling and directionless quality at times, and begins to feel looooonnnnggggg.That said, there are moments of genuine tension and relative horror - all of which can be credited to the perversely creepy Jackie Earle Haley (made all the creepier by his child-star past).

Written by critically acclaimed novelist Tom Perrotta (who also wrote the novel in which the film is based on) and co written by Todd Field, 'Little Children' follows the stories of Sarah Pierce (Kate Winslet) a lapsed feminist trapped in a marriage where there is no love. She spends her days taking care of Lucy (Sadie Goldstein) her daughter at the park or the town pool while her husband Richard (Gregg Edelman) is either working or obsessing over an internet fantasy woman deemed Sluttykay. Sarah longs for something more and one day at the park she meets Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson) and instantly the two are pulled into an attraction so real, so moving that they begin to have an affair. But Brad, like Sarah, longs for something more himself. He's a stay at home father who takes care of his son Aaron (Ty Simpkins) by day and studies for the bar exam in which he has failed to pass by night. His wife Kathy Adamson (Jennifer Connelly) is busy at work non stop as a documentary filmmaker. At night when Brad is supposed to be studying for the exam, he is really distracted by a group of kid skateboarders. And one fateful night, he sees an old time buddy, Larry Hedges (Noah Emmerich) an ex-cop bent on attacking and humiliating a recent pedophile Ronnie J. McGorvey (Jackie Earle Haley) who recently moved into town and lives with his elderly concerned mother May (Phyllis Somerville). Larry goes so far as to start a 'comitte for concerned parents' but Larry has his own problems, as he accidentally shot someone a few years ago. As the film progresses, we are drawn into the ever intersecting characters lives as they deal with affairs, and their own personal demons.In the film, the actors really shine, especially Kate Winslet who really gets into her role, and really impresses the viewer. Jackie Earle Haley is so believable as the ever hard character of the pedophile, it's almost as if he is the role.The writing is clever, really pulling the viewer in. The film is tough to watch, because I'm sure you'll see yourself in at least one character, Little Children feels real, because it's written so truthfully and at one time or another I'm also sure you've bound to have felt like one of the characters as well. Field gives us and impressive film, an Oscar worthy masterpiece that unfortunately was somewhat overlooked. There are some good scenes, such as when Kathy knows at the dinner table that her husband is having an affair, the clever voice over narrations from time to time or the powerful, gripping and suspenseful ending that'll leave you speechless, on the edge and thirsting for more.An intense, dramatic masterpiece, well crafted, well acted and very truthful, You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll be left wanting more as 'Little Children' is what good films are all about 10/10",Little Children

We are a country of self-righteous hypocrites who band together to crush evil wherever it may be found but overlook our own weaknesses.The story on one level is exceedingly banal: it shifts from scene to scene exposing the triviality of day to day life. Yet there is that haunting sound of an approaching train. Are we witnessing a train wreck? The brilliant use of a narrator lulls us into the belief that this is just a children's story and nothing bad will happen. Yet our eyes are glued to the screen as we await the crash.Jackie Earle Haley as Ronnie exposes everything that is wrong with our modern world and everything that is right about character acting. He gives a stand out performance definitely worthy of Oscar consideration. The character represents an unknown evil in our community, one that must be sought out and destroyed. His character at times is sympathetic, even lovable and other other times hideous and menacing.But who is more detestable? Is it Ronnie or is it those infinitely boring (but beautiful) adulterers, Sarah (Kate Winslet) or Brad (Patrick Wilson)? Is it up to us to judge? If we do, are we not being like the suburban community that is the metaphor for our society? In that way, Director Todd Fields includes us in the movie whether we know it or not. This is a wonderful (train) ride that will keep us talking for days. It is one of this year's great movies.",Little Children
248,lindaaceves-309-963367,Great Winslet!,7,9 March 2012,"Upon talking about raising children and busy schedules, the women of the neighborhood are delighted with the return of Brad a.k.a. ""The Prom King,"" who indulges their erotic fantasies. The attraction between Sarah and Brad isn't as obvious from the beginning but a small bet will change that. The two acquire at first, a friendship in the interest of simple companionship, a get away from their spouses, where they could feel support. After the sexual tension is ignited, it remains there through trips to the park, pool and Sarah's infamous laundry room.Todd Field's brutal honesty of adulthood in Suburbia is strikingly palpable and he never leaves the mind of the characters. Unfortunately Field and Perrotta often bring many questions about morality and judgment to the table and leave the subjects murky. The adaptation is great but there are so many points and features to make in this narrative, the two writers couldn't tackle each task. The dialogue is always engaging and inviting for the viewer; I always felt the need to listen to every word.The performances for the most part are remarkable. Patrick Wilson's ""Brad"" is extremely character-flawed. His immaturity is evident in every scene and Wilson does an impressive job of portraying that. Brad is stuck in a world, a world somewhere in between high school graduation and yesterday's pasta dinner. His identity seeking is never exposed until the meeting of Sarah and his immaturity is never more manifested until the finale. The underdeveloped character of Kathy is sometimes bothersome but with the flow of the story it fits the aura of the picture. Jennifer Connelly does well with her minimal screen time but it isn't the marvel of the film that stands out like other low-screen time performances have been in the past. Also, the great Noah Emmerich and Phyllis Somerville are great in their respective roles.The two standouts lay in the unknown comeback of Jackie Earle Haley, who plays Ronald McGovern, a recently released pedophile searching for a new beginning in a town unkind to the power of forgiveness and profound origination. In Haley, the viewer finds the most sympathy of all the players and this viewer was delighted to find it. In no way are people accepting of pedophilia, but we can start to sympathize with anyone who yearns for the restart of any kind and becomes bewildered and astray in the process. Haley's ""Ronnie"" is so tortured in his soul but does find security and contentment in his loving mother. She offers solace and guidance in Ronnie's rebuilding of life that adds to the atmosphere and provides a beautiful emotional center to the ""Children."" The other standout could be no other than the most talented young actress working today, Kate Winslet. Her ""Sarah,"" like ""Ronnie"" has a tortured persona along with a yearn for happiness that is missing in her life. The symbolism of trains in the film gave amazing insight to what Sarah and Brad were really about. Winslet falls inside of ""Sarah"" and never comes to the surface. At 31, Winslet is still thinking of different ways to enchant the audience and give us something new every time. The vivacity of ""Sarah"" is sometimes hard to swallow because of her priorities with her child and Brad but in the finale you will feel comfort in the choice of her character. But this is not by any means, the best performance of her career but a definite contender nonetheless in the competitive Actress race.",Little Children
249,lauzilovesspongiebob,"Magically entrancing and yet so tragic,",9,28 April 2009,"When approaching this film, I watched the trailer to gain an oversight of what the film consisted of and what I was going to view. I did not want to began to watch the film with a blank canvas.The trailer highlights a brief story of an affair, a betrayal and the hurt caused by it. If you have yet to see this film, I urge you, do not go by what the trailer entails. This is not just a simple story about an affair, ravished by two people in loveless marriages. This is an entrancing tale of the urges we have and the consequences that occur when these passions are fulfilled.The plot revolves around five people, though mainly the characters of Sarah (Kate Winslet) and Brad (Patrick Wilson.) Sarah is a lonely housewife, not particularly keen on her role that revolves around her child whom she feels unfamiliar with. Brad is more or less a stay at home husband whilst his wife (Jennifer Connonlly) has an important job that brings in the income to the family's lives. Sarah and Brad meet in a playground, where the other mothers are intimidated by him and crown him with the nickname, ""the Prom King."" Sarah becomes curious of Brad, his presence in this playground is strange and soon, the two of them begin a friendship, making a habit of taking both of their young children to the local pool. The sexual tension between them is obvious and it becomes apparent that something will occur between them. By the end of the film, it is quite clear that they have almost transformed in front of our eyes into what brought them together - Little Children.Ronnie is a man accused of exposing himself to a minor, hence he is pretty much harassed everyday by a retired cop and is subject to much abuse and horror whenever he steps out of his front door, his mother being the only one who truly loves him. His character is one of the more powerful in this story - I felt I could not feel sorry for him yet I could also not dislike him. Though he is definitely someone that may or may not be allowed back into society, his character is so beautifully portrayed in this movie, that I found it very difficult to hate him. This is an issue that is difficult to talk about but showing aspects of Ronnie's personality and the way he deals with his so called ""illness"" is really quite painful to watch. From trying to date women his own age, we explore Ronnie's world well and I really feel his character should have been focused upon more in this film. Larry, the policeman who harasses Ronny nearly every night, honking his horn outside his house every night and shouting abuse up at his window, is again, a character who is well hidden within his first introduction but it is evidentially clear that he again has inner issues that need to come to the surface. His main interaction's with both Brad and Ronny are so diverse and so well portrayed, his anger shining through the surface at every given opportunity. The link between Ronny and Larry's characters is surprisingly well thought out and I really do congratulate both actors because they performed so well in their roles.This film, however, did have its negative points - Sarah and Brad's partners are barely focused upon. I kept waiting for their stories to come into the connection of the whole plot but it was going to be a long wait. Neither are focused upon in large proportions - although maybe this was supposed to be the point. Jennifer Connolly, especially, is given a minor role and it is a real shame that her character is not emphasized within the structure of the movie. The story between their relationship is not fully developed in my opinion, and I feel if it had been told a little better, this film would have only benefited from it.Overall, I would give Little Children 9/10. It is a marvellous film, brilliantly set with beautiful characters tragically all trying to find something they simply cannot have. It is a story of adults and yet it is a story of children and I for one, immensely enjoyed it.",Little Children
250,thegreenman5,"Pointless, disgusting waste of time",1,31 December 2006,"This movie was disgusting and an unquestionable waste of time. Thank God I didn't pay to see this movie. Received it as a free DVD as a member of the WGA to judge ""for your consideration"". Don't even bother watching this movie under any circumstances. Meant to be a hidden glimpse/satire of American Suburbia where adults act like children, it is certainly the worst movie I have seen in 2006, if not the last 5 years. I'm stunned by the glowing reviews found on these pages and seriously wonder if they were written by the director and his publicist. I'm certainly no prude and I'm not coming from some morally offended point of view, but there is absolutely NOTHING redeeming about this film. There is not a single character in this film for which I had a shred of empathy and I could not have cared less what happened to any of them. In fact after watching half the film I found myself hoping for a giant sinkhole to appear and swallow them all up and take them to some insipid hell where they belonged. I will certainly avoid any movies by this director or writer for the rest of my life. For god sakes, was your own twisted and perverted childhood so horrible that you have to foist this garbage on the rest of us? Who green lights this type of utterly useless film? Rent ""21 Grams"" or ""Blue Velvet"" again if you need to glimpse the seamier side of America; at least in those films there is some appreciation for the human condition and an effort is made to connect to some part of the human soul while depicting the darker sides of our natures. Was this supposed to be ""dark humor"" or satire? The only thing dark or satirical about this waste of celluloid was the 2 hours of my life I will never get back from watching it. Even Kate Winslet getting naked couldn't save this product of mental & emotional midgetry. It's too bad you can't vote ""zero"" out of 10 here at IMDb because rarely has there ever been a film that deserved it more.",Little Children
251,BaldyCotton,interesting try but overrated,6,12 November 2006,"Saw this film last night--while it was a mostly enjoyable couple of hours, I really feel that it's overrated. For starters, the whole way through I felt like I was watching the distilled cinematic version of a novel, and I had no idea about the source material going in. Jennifer Connelly is fantastic and should've been given more screen time in the final cut (not sure why--or did she?--agree to be second banana to Kate Winslet). I think the two leads are miscast . . . Patrick Wilson does not ring true as the self-doubting ex-jock (the whole skateboarding metaphor is a joke, particularly later on). His performance is okay, but I'm just not buying him in the role. Way too pretty, and I agree with what others have said: that it's highly unlikely two beautiful, privileged spouses would be at such different places in their lives so early in their marriage. Same goes for Winslet--too pretty and smart (the film suggests she's an ABD lit. academic) to be married to such a top-drawer weenie, plus I found her US accent this time out was a little too distracting/patrician for the suburban role.There's no nuance in the secondary characters--I found Noah Emmerich's performance to be annoying/uninteresting . . . he was just kind of like a wet pair of diapers that won't go away, and if he's one of the ""little children,"" that's not nearly enough to hold my interest. Similarly, the suburban moms are presented in a totally ridiculous way: let's see, we've got a Witches of Eastwick-lite blond mom, a red-haired mom, and a black-haired mom all sitting together on the park bench (you see, they have to sit together 'cause they're all essentially the same stock character). But Winslet is different, 'cause, like, she's on the other bench. Just too cartoony for me, and again later in the book club segment blond mom is presented as a one-note drone. Not to say those moms don't exist, but I really don't see the point here other than to hit the ""stupid"" viewer over the head. This is a pretty easy target for the filmmaker/screenwriter. Other than in Jackie Earle Haley's character, where's the complexity? The best movies have character actors who offer layered performances.The dragnet copsounding narrator also didn't really work for me. A little too droll by half. And I must say that I'm growing very weary of the show-ending-intercut-montage-sequence-with-voice-over device that every drama on TV currently exploits to the hilt, and now apparently filmmakers feel the need to use. Please, directors, avoid the bravura montage sequence . . . I'm begging you! Magnolia really created a monster with that.See the movie and decide for yourself. I'm not sorry I saw itI was just expecting more. Love that Connelly, though. I think I'd probably watch her reciting the phone book.",Little Children
252,zuihitsu,A story that didn't dare to go there,7,15 July 2007,"Little Children isn't a bad movie. Kate Winslet does a great job, the child actors are okay, actually none of the actors perform half bad. The story is okay and it has funny moments, sad moments, etc. The dialog is well written, camera-work is good... But, Little Children isn't a very good movie. It's okay, I don't regret watching it.The problem is that it's written so... safe. It's like the movie pretends to dare to take that important, bold step towards very interesting, hesitates and puts its foot back to the ground. First sign of this in the movie was when they introduced Ronnie the Pervert. So, he'd shown his genitals to some kids and had been in prison for that. It was obvious from this point that he'll play in important part in the movie, but still the movie fails to make us really hate him, or to really feel for him. I know that's part of the whole idea, to blend the morals. Still I found it weak.Other weak points in the movie were the obvious thing how the ex-cop has a dark past, and that's why he's mean to the pervert of the neighborhood. The way Brad & his wife never really get to argue about the affair. How both Sarah & Brad separately decide not to run off after all. How Ronnie the pervert is really just a messed-up kid. How the ex-cop becomes responsible for Ronnie's mothers death. The whole thing is kind of about how nothing really happens. One old woman dies, others just yammer about everything. Nothing really wrong with it, as I stated above, the movie isn't bad, it's entertaining enough. But the potential in the story and the actors leaves a bad taste to mouth, because it feels like they wasted it. The moved didn't dare to go there.One other thing was a somewhat classic Hollywood thing, but still off-putting. Brad calls Sarah plain looking. He says Kate Wislet is plain looking. Oh come on. And the way this is portrayed in the film, is that Kate wears less obvious make-up than Jennifer Connelly. This is the same category as putting glasses on women to make them more ""unattractive"". It's stupid to cast some of the most beautiful people in the industry to the main roles, and then try to use make-up or glasses or whatever to show them as ""ordinary"". There are plenty of excellent actors, who already look ordinary. Use them, or stop pretending. I like watching gorgeous people as much as the next guy, but I hate that pretending. (Especially when I don't find Ms. Connelly that attractive in the first place, she looks like a doll).Not bad, but too much of a Hollywood cliché to be called a good movie.",Little Children
253,richnindy,Haunting,8,8 January 2007,"""Little Children"" is a fairly faithful adaptation of Tom Perotta's excellent satire of suburbia, and although I cannot imagine exactly what I would cut, it is paced execrably. I had the same problem with ""In the Bedroom:"" Todd Field is obviously amazing with actors, but he is not a ""born director"" and hasn't a clue how to draw viewers into a movie. The movie is never actually boring but it plods along and seems about twice as long as it is.That being said, it sticks with you like almost no other movie I have seen recently. Images and scenes keep flashing into my memory. Particularly memorable was Phyllis Somerville as the mother of a convicted sex offender. Her every scene is lifelike and yet amazing. Her love for her (deeply flawed) son is so deep and so affecting, it will stay with me for a long time to come.Likewise, Jackie Earle Haley, as her son, creates a complex characterization, both pitiable and horrifying. (The amazing yet creepy scene he has with Jane Addams manages to bring both together.) Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson play the major characters, and although Wilson is probably perfectly cast and Winslet is often amazing (the fleeting changes in expression in a single shot sometimes brought me close to tears), their characters seem less startlingly original than Somerville's and Haley's. (That was not true of those characters in the novel.) Jennifer Connelly, and especially Gregg Edelman, are wasted as their spouses. I was particularly sorry that the character of Mary Ann, superbly played by Mary McGann, was radically truncated from the book.And I was even more sorry that the quiet yet emotionally satisfying conclusion to the book was replaced by a garish new ending. OK, the book's ending was far, far from ""cinematic,"" but it at least made sense for the characters involved (Sarah, Ronnie, Mary Ann and Larry). This new ending is . . . OK, disappointing is a mild word for it.But the biggest disappointment is the studio's apparent trashing of the movie's distribution. The movie was released LAST FALL to generally decent reviews, but made it to my own city -- a somewhat major metropolitan area -- four months later. Apparently the movie has made about a tenth of what it cost, but it's expertly cast, and the audience I saw it with was quite receptive. Obviously, it's marketable, but the studio chose to dump it. After Mr. Field's dedication to the project, as well as Mr. Perotta's and the entire cast and crew (evident from the care in making the movie), that is the real crime.",Little Children
254,theladysif,Patrick Wilson is BUFF!!,7,5 January 2007,"Superficially, Patrick Wilson is hot. My god what a body! What I wouldn't give to be in Kate's place. Now, more serious comments... Wow, there is much to say about this film. At times I wonder why Field has two stories parallel each other, and other times it was quite obvious. The one thing I'm curious about is the fact that Brad had a very easy, patient ease with his son. Whereas, Sarah seemed annoyed with Lucy all the time. Yet in the end, Brad was willing to leave his son, whereas Sarah did not want to leave Lucy and suddenly it seemed that Lucy's welfare seemed to snap Sarah out of it at the end. Curious?! Also I'm wondering when Sarah comes back from her overnight trip with Brad, why did her bookclub friend get mad...or I should say how did bookclub friend know that Sarah had lied or done something dishonest? I had to leave during a brief scene prior to that, maybe I missed what Sarah told her so that she would stay with Lucy. I'm still pondering the movie as there is much that Todd Field throws at you in this film. I'm anxious to read other's remarks.",Little Children
255,csyangel,Closed to reality,9,28 October 2008,"This film is so like American Beauty, ironic but so closed to reality.Kate Winslet acts as an upper-class housewife(Sarah) who has English literature master degree. She's not satisfied with her life, taking care of her only daughter all day long. Having small talks with bizarre husband. To her, everything is so blank and boring. One day, she met Patrick Wilson(Brad). A handsome house-dad with no occupation, no real goal toward life but lives with a smart and beautiful wife. They are two individuals so alike. It's been a while no one would like to listen to them, share happiness through life with them. Their affair ferments vigorously, luckily their better halves didn't detect something peculiar.Jackie Earle Haley(Ronnie), a psycho in this film. I would say his performance is outstanding. Few years ago, he really did something wrong but now he's living with his dear mom in this town. He wants to amend his conduct but nobody wants to give him another chance. As he said when his mom died, ""No one loves me, mommy is the only one who loves me..."" Upon seeing that scene, I almost burst into tears. I'm glad to see former policeman Noah Emmerich(Larry) found him in the park at last, their resentment at that moment made a period.The director gives us a happy ending with a few meaningful lines.

256,frankstelt,Excellent piece of film-making,10,9 January 2007,"This is one of the best films of 2006. Kate Winslet is superb, as usual, as a bored housewife/mother who has an affair with the husband of Jennifer Connelly's character, with consequences evolving in several directions. It's Winslet's show, with Connelly playing mostly an incidental role as the ""knockout"" wife of the man cavorting with Winslet. There's a very funny insert with Connelly's character preening for the camera like a fashion model, very unlike the documentary filmmaker she is, poking fun at extraordinary beauty, and how it's insufficient to keep a husband from straying. There's also a deadpan narrator who's often hilarious in his understated background of the action. He's a familiar voice. I later found that he's the voice of Nova on PBS. Finally, kudos to Jackie Earle Haley, probably best known as the motorcycle riding/smoker/kid baseball player in The Bad News Bears, from 30 years ago. He plays an en-con trying to re-enter society in a white bread neighborhood. His is a powerful, poignant performance. Across the board, the acting is excellent, as is the script, adapted from a novel by the director, Todd Field (In the Bedroom).",Little Children

I hadn't heard a lot about and really didn't know what to expect. After watching it, I found myself thinking quite a bit about it which is a very good sign to me.Although it appears as a rather uneventful and dull movie, it manages to keep you very interested throughout the movie. This is not the kind of movie I would have thought I needed to pause for me to go to the bathroom, however I was indeed mistaken. Not being a huge fan of anyone in the cast, I was impressed with their chemistry. Everything seemed very realistic of what I would expect in a natural young couple. This is definitely a movie I would suggest watching when you're prepared to be attentive, as I would expect missing certain details or conversations would probably lower the effect of the movie.I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies such as Hard Candy, Closer, or Sideways.

258,soccer.goalie@verizon.net,Amazing!,10,21 October 2006,"Out of all the ""Oscar Bait"" films I've seen this year, this film beats them all. Little Children is an unbelievable masterpiece about what it means to grow up. This idea is brilliantly portrayed through characters - while categorized as ""adults"" - have yet to outgrow certain adolescent stages.Brad is a man who never got the chance to experience the spotlight in his youth, and now he desperately craves attention, acknowledgment, or admiration in any form.Sarah is a woman who never learned how to grow past her own selfishness. She is angry at her daughter for needing attention when all Sarah wants is some time to herself.Larry is a man who still harbors bully-like tendencies, and desperately just wants to fit in and be one of the guys. This is seen through his treatment of Ronnie - the pedophile who was just released from prison and returned to the neighborhood.Ronnie is the dangerous man. The man who cannot connect with people his own age and seeks sexual gratification with children or with people who - like him - cannot fit into the adult world.This isn't an action moving - it's an interaction movie. The scenes between characters have you nailed to your seat and deeply invested. The characters interact within their small community, and their actions with each other build into a climatic explosion that forces them all to face truths about themselves, and - finally - accept their responsibilities as mothers, husbands, fathers, and humans. This accepting is what separates little children from adults, immature from mature.The tale is moving, sad, hilarious, dark, breathtaking, thought-provoking and many other creative adjectives. It forces you to reevaluate your idea of yourself and your thoughts on others. It forces you to see people you would normally loath and dismiss in a differently light. This a movie you will come out of changed. If you only see one film a higher, I cannot recommend this one more.",Little Children
259,andrei-m,Disturbing and sad,2,11 August 2007,"After reading some comments in the local newspaper I expected a funny, well played movie about modern parents. Being a parent myself I wanted to laugh a little about our anguishes and dreams and little regrets.""Little children"" felt like a horror movie. I came out deeply sad. Sarah (Kate Winslet) is surrounded by a company of perverts (her husband Richard is in love with an internet porn star, Ronnie is a child abuser - really scary, very convincingly played by J E Haley) simply mean people (the other mothers as soon as they notice that Sarah has more pride and courage than they have; Larry the ex-cop who has a logical explanation why he is so mean but no excuse; in a more subtle way Kathy Adamson played by J Connelly) and cold hearted idiots like handsome Patrick. For Sarah there is no way out. There is nobody she can trust and she is very lonely among all those deranged or mean people.She meets Patrick and has a very sweet relationship with him. She accepts his inferior intelligence and his primordial fear of his wife, and she understands his difficulty to accept his own feelings. They both try hard not to hurt anybody's feelings. Patrick's wife Kathy notices nevertheless. Strangely she barely reacts. I didn't understand this figure, she is very controlling toward Patrick but gives him no warmth, no confidence, no answers. It seemed to me she didn't really care very much for him as long as he did his chores and wanted no sex with her. Kathy scared me almost as much as Ronnie.The end is just weird. Patrick is in love with Sarah, they had wonderful sex which he craved for, he knows she waits for him in a park at night in a neighborhood with not 1 but 2 dangerously deranged men, he knows she has her little daughter with her. And he forgets her on his way to meet her. He's just fooling around then falls on his head. That's all. Now if this is not a bad screenplay I don't know.Then Ronnie's horrible mother - she seemed for me more than a sufficient reason to become as mad as he was - dies and he castrates himself. The movie tries to sell you this horrid scene as some kind of catharsis, of self inflicted justice. This I found shocking. This guy is sick, he belongs in an asylum or hospital, not amputated. What's the idea ? Are all deranged people to blame ? Should they kindly punish themselves ? Probably the screenplay was written by people with completely other values than me. They probably can laugh at all the humiliating and scary situations in which they place Sarah but I wasn't able to laugh even once. If you have children and want to see a nightmare, this movie is for you. Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson are both doing a great job, a pity Wilson's role is so inconsistent and in the end plainly absurd. A star for each of them. Poor Jennifer Connelly, her role is close to meaningless, she seems to be there just so Patrick Wilson has someone to be afraid of.",Little Children
260,capital pictures,Little Children is a significant film,8,17 October 2006,"I saw ""Little Children"" tonight. My wife hated it. I had read that this is a film that makes you think. It did. It made me think about ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf"" because each one of the characters was trying to create a fantasy world that really didn't work. They didn't want to face reality, but, at the end of the fairly long film, they, fortunately for all at hand, accepted reality for whatever it was worth, and dealt with it. It was also about favoring emotional as opposed to physical relationships. It might have been about too many things, and it might have been too graphically explicit to make the film meaningful to a broad audience. But it is a significant film.I would criticize the film for dwelling too much on the graphic sex. I had the sense that the director focused on it, and the full body shots, at least from the rear, because he could, and not because it was necessary. My problem with it is that it makes some people feel uncomfortable seeing this, particularly when they don't expect it, so it takes away from the dramatic effect of the film. On the other hand, I do believe that seeing the physical relationships here in full between the two principals does tend to cheapen their relationship somewhat so that you can contrast, or at least think about, the emotional vs. the sexual bonds.It is difficult for me to recommend this film to anyone because I am afraid that they will hate it. But for the same reason, I would have had difficulty recommending ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf"". They are different stories,and this is not so significant as the Albee play and film, but ""Little Children"" reminds me of it. It has something to do with accepting each other as we are and not how we, in some fantasy, hope the other pereson will be. It goes much further than that, but a film review is not the place to enter such a discussion.",Little Children

The narrator from Frontline makes this a true work of art. This is a very overlooked film, but it's a gem for those who are lucky enough to have seen its brilliance, in simultaneous humor, drama, tragedy and the strange bonds of humanity.Amazing supporting roles also put in, not a bad performance, not a bad line from start to finish.

262,kubrickklockwerk,"""A film that will stand the test of time...""",10,31 January 2008,"This was a quote by Mike Clark of USA Today that I read on the back the ""Little Children"" DVD, and I could not agree with him more. ""Little Children"" is a fulfilling and complex drama. ""Little Children"" is hilarious and romantic. ""Little Children"" is one of a kind. Very rarely can films meld the insane, hilarious moments of comedy with such heartfelt and poignant moments of drama. This film pulls that off, and so much more. It is impossible for me to completely comment on all the profundity, the genuineness, the irresistible likability that this film evokes. To put it in plain terms, you don't see quotes like this one all the time.""Little Children"" is the story of suburban lives that aren't so regularly suburban. It first centers around the boring and maternal life of a stay-at-home mom, Sarah Pierce (played spectacularly by Kate Winslet), who begins to become upset and disgusted with her monotonous and unfair life. She spends most of her time looking after her daughter, Lucy. But Sarah is not a typical suburban housewife. One day a man shows up with his son at a park Sarah and other housewives go to. They are astonished, as they never see men at the park at this hour. This ""Prom King"" Brad Adamson (Patrick Wilson) is causing quite a stir. The other housewives dare Sarah to talk to him. She does, but before she leaves, she whispers to Brad to hug her in order freak the others out. They do, but then they kiss. This film follows the secret affair of the two lovers who see each other at parks, pools, and other childhood places. An entire subplot emerges, when Ronnie McGorvey (wonderfully portrayed by Jackie Earle Haley), a man rumored with voyeuristic tendencies moves into town. This puts the whole town in an uproar. People start handing out fliers. Some start harassing Ronnie directly. It even ends up on the news. One of the major efforts of the movie that I loved so much, was that it made sinful and immoral characters, like Ronnie, pitiable and lovable. This is brilliantly done by director Todd Field, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Tom Perrotta, the author of the novel by the same name. There are many scenes in this film which are beautifully shot. Transitions of different days at the pool while still maintaining the same day's environment, juxtaposition of the sex scenes with logical metaphors in other scenes, and ultimately the climatic last 15 minutes, are all displayed with care.It would be difficult to write this review without commenting the powerhouse performances, particularly those of Winslet and Haley. Kate Winslet does Sarah Pierce amazing justice. Her mannerisms are subtle and quirky. She is a very plain and ""normal"" character, but Winslet keeps her fresh, entertaining, and hard to take your eyes off of. Despite the fact that she is a fictional character, most people could probrably picture a character similar to hers living down the street. That is probrably Winslet's acting apex in this movie; she manages to make every plot detail involving her character totally believable. Few films can be realistic and still keep the audience awake. Haley performs McGorvey realistically too, and yet he manages to win the audience's sympathy. Very few actors could pull off what he has done here: he has made such a controversial and disturbing character the subject of cathartic pity from the audience. His mannerisms and demeanor echo back to the film's title, and it is only appropriate to say that Haley did this intentionally and quite effectively. His character actions and speech beautifully cause this thematic effect; he is a child in a man's body. There are great supporting performances by Jennifer Connelly, Noah Emmerich, and especially Phyllis Somerville. Somerville really does get to deliver some of the best lines in the picture.The thematic power of this movie is tangible and potent. If for no other reason, watch this movie for its overwhelming profundity. It constantly reveals the desperation people have to try new things in order to feel alive, even if it's immoral. It has a unique way of making things usually seen as disturbing and filthy, ironically pitiable. Society's perceptions of expected behavior, judgement, and obsession with appearances continually show up. The fact that Brad and Sarah's relationship is based on their children's lives is an interesting concept to grasp by itself. It's odd how film can make things stick with you. This is a perfect example. Depending on your mentality, this film can leave you with any number of insights. That, in particular, is what makes this movie so special and excellent.I love how ""Little Children"" delves into the lives of everyday people, and isn't boring like any number typical James L. Brooks comedies that try to do the same thing. That is a task few other pictures can boast about. The wonderful twist on frowned upon affairs is that Brad and Sarah's specific affair is almost a vindication. The audience feels that Sarah deserves this. The wonderful twist of a frowned upon ""creep"" is that Ronnie McGorvey is a scapegoat of mistreatment; he doesn't deserve it and the audience wants people to leave him alone. ""Little Children"" is a champion of revealing things that are so real and so true, but so effectively interesting as well. It was nominated for 3 Golden Globes(2007), including Best Motion Picture Drama. It was nominated for 3 Oscars (2007) including Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Adapted Screenplay. If you want to watch something that will manage to make you laugh uncontrollably and then get you to cry emotionally within the same time frame, this is one of the rare exceptions that can genuinely do that. This is convincing, sexual drama at its best. This film proves that at the end of the day, adults are just physically developed beings trying to pretend they aren't little children deep down.",Little Children
263,AmyTee2,sorely unimpressed,3,18 September 2008,"I had heard so much about this film -- such horrahs! Finally saw it last night and found it to be a one-note disappointment full of woefully miscast actors with the added bonus of scripted caricatures.For god knows what reason, the director tossed in a narrator to tell me what to think just in case the actors he cast could not convey what he demanded I take away from his bland little film. As the film began I thought it was going to be a comedy, a satire. We see three ""typical suburban"" housewives, we're taught by the intrusive narrator... typical suburban housewives? What lazy shorthand twaddle. What is a typical urban house wife? Sitting apart from them -- this is meant to sledgehammer home the point -- ""Sarah was not a typical suburban housewife?"" Huh? Why, because she has a MFA? I've lived in cities all my life, and I would say that the ""bridge and tunnel crowd"", if you'll excuse the expression, comes in all stripes. Sarah is played by Kate Winslet. We are later told by the narrator that she's unattractive and boyish... Kate Winslet? Kate Winslet's husband, who is having a virtual affair with an internet porn star, is a nothing character. He is there for no other reason that to make Winslet's character sympathetic in her adultery. Patrick Wilson who plays the unemployed ex-jock is positively pallid -- he is so bland and lifeless that we wonder what his wife, a documentary film maker played by Jennifer Connelly is doing with him. Apparently, as I read later, Connelly is meant to convey a brittle nature, cold and cunning but in this film she seems fragile -- a quality virtually always conveyed by Connelly. She seems to adore her son, she's affectionate, her son adores her. But apparently I was supposed to see her as distant and unable to be loving with her son in contrast to her instant empathy with the children in her documentary.Then a man who exposed himself to a minor gets out of jail and moves to town. This rallies those suburbanites in fear. He, we are told by other characters, is a child molester. He too becomes an instant stereo type -- all child-molesters are piggy-eyed, pock-faced mini-monsters with zero social skills who live with their mommies. For crying out loud! What makes child molesters scary is they have no distinguishing characteristics. In real life, we find out the youth pastor is a child molester, or our accountant, or our brother-in-law.The whole thing rang utterly false.",Little Children
264,gulkorm,A Film to Be Watched,9,26 May 2009,"The ringing of countless clocks commences this film, whose subject concerns American suburban life. This sound fragments the day into hourly slivers which the suburbanites follow without skepticism. But under the street-lamps, at the end of the day, the main characters cast their shadows too far. Kate Winslet plays the frustrated, educated mother, the spectacle of the film, with Gregg Edelman as her erotica-obsessed husband, and Sadie Goldstein as their neglected daughter. As Sarah, Winslet's life brings her to Brad, played by Patrick Wilson, another disenchanted suburbanite and Ronnie, a desperate child predator. In Hollywood fashion their lives are intertwined more and more until the climax, but the way in which the director depicts these characters makes their stories authentic and profound.Sarah and Brad become secret and passionate lovers after a scandalous kiss at the playground, a kiss which made disappear the suburban wives and mothers from Sarah's life. The incident that they committed filled them with vivacity and sexual energy. That the spectators sees their faults, their relationship, and their unhappiness only adds to the underlining of all the scenes by the small-town friendly narration of Will Lyman.The other characters must be mentioned because of their strong and sensitive performances. Ronnie, the pedophile, is encouraged by his mother, who only wants good for her son and that he will change. He is harassed because of his problem but Field does not subjectively comment on his actions. This relationship makes us realize the love of a mother for her son and that others, the ones about whom we read in newspapers, are not as different as we think. The empress of suburban life, Mary B. McCann plays her role to the extreme, a mother who embodies the incessant ringing of the clocks from the beginning of the film and who confirms the dominant aura of the suburbs.Based on the novel by Tom Perrotta, the film transmits well the subtlety of emotions and themes. Field explores the interior of the characters, their relationships, and their surroundings; one sees this in the recurring images, always facing upwards, of silent trees, deserted playgrounds, and grand New England houses. Also, Field makes evident the idea of movement in a new direction, the future, and that this movement obliges us to forget, to hurt ourselves, or to relapse. This is well illustrated in the stories and dialogues, the brief and intense interaction of the characters.Field has given us an extraordinary film with the talent and professionalism of Hollywood and the introversion and symbolism of the novel. This film should be watched to know the direction where Hollywood could go.",Little Children
265,jonboyandroid,Characters without character,8,9 August 2012,"This film is about people going about their lives, each in their own little bubble.I loved Phyllis Somervile playing the loving mother of a pervert who is not a bad person, just a person who did a bad thing. She has complete love for her son Ronnie who is stalked by the bully, Larry. When Larry attacks Ronnie verbally, she calls Larry a bad man and puts him right in his place. Each character is like Larry - they all go about their lives, so intent on their desires that they do not realize the impacts of their actions.The film is an emotional roller coaster. At moments it is funny, and sad, and darkly comedic, and tragic. For example, You feel doom before Ronnie is about to victimize yet another person, then oddly laugh as it starts, and then the remorse sets in as you feel the extreme pain of his victim. So either the film set up this odd combination of emotions, or I just forgot to take my lithium.",Little Children

267,robgee9,Probalby One of the Worst Movies I've Ever Seen.,1,24 October 2006,"From the first scene to the last, almost every moment of this movie is a misstep. Unbelievable, ridiculous, unintentionally funny, and downright dumb. Let's take the very first scene. Three housewives are sitting in a park with their kids. They see the handsome Patrick Dempsey character walking his kid, and start giggling like schoolgirls about how mysterious he is, and call him the ""Prom King."" All three of these women are boring caricatures, indifferent from each other. Then Kate Winslet's character shows up. She is, of course, the more sensitive one of the bunch. They offer her character $5 if she can get his phone number. We're supposed to believe that three 30-something women giggle like teenagers and are afraid to talk to a single father just because he's handsome? Of course, Kate does get his phone number, as a prank, and then kisses him briefly, and then the women all run to get their children like chickens with their heads cut off, for fear they'll see Kate kissing this guy. Nonsense! We're supposed to believe modern women behave this way?? Why go on? Almost every moment of this movie is equally ridiculous and unmotivated, and I nearly walked out. Other than Patrick Dempsey, even the acting is poor, and the dialog dull and often insipid. As a movie about the ""underside"" of suburbia, see ""Blue Velvet."" It's much more imaginative, intelligent and entertaining.",Little Children
268,cfdacunha-1,"Simply excruciating for lack of a better, inoffensive word",2,11 July 2007,"I couldn't possibly add anything to what ""missionguy"" hasn't already so succinctly exposed in his comment. I've just watched this film a few days ago and simply could not believe the level of overall inanity and that of the director in particular. I was going to spare the author of the novel but now that I've looked him up and found out that Tom Perrotta himself has adapted his novel (after all we're talking about the writer of the hilarious ""Election"" here), he's going to have to be thrown into the pot too. Not since ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" and more recently ""Fur: etc..."" was there such atrocious use of the omniscient (and unforgivably redundant) narrator. At least in Ed Wood's film it made me laugh heartily and in the Nicole Kidman's unfortunate fantasy on Diane Arbus I got to chuckle here and there; here I couldn't undo a frightening rictus (witnessed by my boyfriend) throughout the film. ""Surely this is a comedy"", I thought to myself, ""let's wait for the green light"". Correct me if I'm wrong here, but the green light never came and I very quickly had to come to the conclusion that the film was meant to be taken seriously, well-deep seriously. Let's be clear here: for something to be deep, there must be depth involved. There is especially a point that is a clear sign to me how poor the thought-process behind this whole enterprise is: the simplistic and highly implausible pairing of the ambivalent, aimless character of Kate Winslet, no less (and that is another problem in Hollywood films: before they are characters, protagonists are first and foremost the actors played by them) married with a guy with a successful and highly lucrative career, juxtaposed with the duo of the self-indulgent ""Prom King"" (Patrick Wilson) whose glory days are obviously far behind and the gorgeous ""Prom Queen"" with a cool (though far humbler - in terms of the American success scale) PBS job as a documentary director (don't even get me started in the Irak documentary shtick; and will someone please explain to me what ""crowns"" the atrocious kid actor was referring to?). It seems there that the author wanted to have each protagonist be married to their mirror opposite (and secretly crave for the opposite of the opposite, are you following me?). For perfect symmetry (and accepting the Hollywood axiom that the duo Kate Winslet & husband represent the unfortunate ""plain people"" and Patrick Wilson & Jennifer Connelly represent the ""gorgeous people"", a very important distinction in American society, apparently), shouldn't Jennifer Connelly be ferociously ambitious? Furthermore, you've got to love Hollywood for presenting a person of such flawless beauty (and obviously very concerned by it as shown in the small scene where Connelly reprimands Wilson for threatening her fabulous figure by cooking delicious pasta. More on that later) as a PBS documentary filmmaker, not that a beautiful woman can't be a soldier of that dignified monolithic industry of ""lofty ideals"", no no. I just don't think that such a dazzling creature could be anything BUT a Hollywood actress, period. Now getting back to the seemingly inoffensive pasta scene. It obviously reveals one of the great Keys to Success (Beauty, Successful Career, Faithful Marriage): self-control. Which leaves us to conclude that self-indulgence leads to the opposite: Ugliness, Pedophilia, Sloth...Sex! Notice that I haven't even bothered to mention the pedophile since its insertion in the story was meant to deal with what the authors of this film initially thought was the subject of the story... something to do with the obvious and not so obvious sexual deviances, or the age old necessity to fingerpoint at a greater evil to mask one's own smaller evils, I really couldn't tell, because that would imply that the authors' intention was to put side by side adultery (heavens, that word! sounds as ominous as ""sodomy"") and pedophilia: adultery as sex deviation?! No. ""Be a good boy"" are the closing words of a dying old mother, (representing bygone, more moral and repressed times?) offering the ultimate advice to all suffering souls: don't self-indulge.",Little Children

I feel I must be missing something because everyone else (except the person I went with) seems to think it's brilliant. I thought it was very poorly done.A major issue for me was that the plot sort of stumbled along. I was never sure where it was going so it felt like just a series of events loosely strung together, without a climax, really, or anything to keep you intensely involved.I think my biggest problem, though, was that so much was left unfinished. There were CONSTANTLY scenes that seemed important, but then they were never touched on again and we never find out what happened. This happened so many times that I can't even keep count.I really wanted to like this movie, but it just had too much missing for me to be able to fully appreciate it.",Little Children

I love Kate Winslet and she was fantastic in this film. I saw ""In the Bedroom"" and ""Little Children"" had a similar style but was much more riveting. I was warned by a writer friend of mine, that the pedophilia might turn me off to the film, but the issues raised were brilliantly-woven into the plot line, and I never shy away from watching films that portray potential realities.It was a good film. The actors were spot-on, and Jennifer Connelly was also really great. I recommend this film to anyone.The movie ended on an ambiguous note- i'm not sure how I feel about the outcome of how the characters ended up. The love affair between the adulterers was charming and real, but in the end, it seemed like the end of the film took upon a moral note without convincingly demonstrating how the characters ended up in their decisions. It's almost like the story decided not to carry things through and reveal the possibilities of the plot line, because the film 'had to end.'

While it certainly does have some dramatic moments to it, here we have a cleverly crafted quite comedic story. It is not slapstick, but the presence of the narrator (kudos on the NFL Films sequence which none of you artsy people will get) as well as the development of the characters makes this a very enjoyable piece.Little Children is of the most poorly marketed and underrated films of the year.

It's main problem is the narration which is intrusive and largely unnecessary. It feels like the makers don't trust the intelligence of the audience. Still I did enjoy it. Kate Winslet again proves what a good actress she is and the rest of the cast are equal to or not far behind her. The panic at the swimming pool scene is brilliantly staged and the film as a whole is nicely understated. Unfortunately the ending is a bit of a cop out. Nothing is resolved between the main two characters and we are robbed of a final scene between the two of them by a far too convenient series of events. These provide the only false notes in the plot. A pity but I left the cinema with a lot to think about, something rare these days.

I have seen most of her movies, excluding Romance And Cigarettes. I highly believe that this was acting at her finest. Kate's portrayal of Sarah was both heartfelt and deep. When I watched Sarah hiding in the car to catch a glimpse of Brad's wife, I felt her pain. When Sarah struggled with her husband's pornography addiction, I sensed her frustration. As you watch the movie, you will feel like you ARE Sarah, which is typical with any Kate Winslet movie. But this movie was different. Kate dug so deep into her character, that she WAS Sarah. The only two things that I found offensive about the movie were the crude language, and raunchy sex scenes. I also did not understand what the sex offender had anything to do with the plot, seeing as Ronnie only interacts with Sarah once. And he hardly interacts with Brad at all.

276,crawhitham,See the film-- *then* read the comments,10,3 December 2006,"We have a Joycean on our hands, ladies, gentlemen and undecided, and if this film doesn't carve your heart out of you, you can't be human. There are excellent comments here on IMDb to summarize the plot line. The purpose of this one is only to summon you to recognize and re-recognize the brilliance, the unthinkable, hardly graspable psychological profundity of *Little Children*.I give it a 10/10 not for its merits as a film production because the *visual* effects-- be it cinematography, framing, light, costumes, even direction-- are either under-thought, low-budget or quite plainly unremarkable. It may as well be a novel. It's a 10/10 because it is an unambiguous, blunt and a bloody gorgeous definition of ART.Pedophile Ronnie enters the public pool with his swimming goggles on, dives and watches the children's legs kick under the water; and it is sickening, infuriating, confusing-- not only because forms of this man are out there in reality, not only because we are forced to recognize that pedophilia and child abuse are facts of *human* nature, of OUR nature, but also because we are under the water, looking through Ronnie's goggles. And we are as trapped as he is-- neither of us can stop watching, no matter how much we nauseate ourselves.The characters grow more complex the more we ponder them, even those less controversial than the story's child abuser. Ronnie is a mystery to any viewer who doesn't share his sexuality, naturally, and those of us are left to ponder whether it came from his fanatically tight bond with his own mother: when his own identity is that of a suckling, it seems logical that he will seek romance and fulfillment of basic human urges in individuals of his genuine age-- little children. It could be his growing up around his mother's elaborate collection of porcelain figurines of children, one in particular being of a little girl in the provocative position of Marilyn Monroe as her skirt flies above her hips, blown by an 'accidental' breeze. Or he could have been born with it. Neither we or Ronnie will ever be sure. But let's take a step back-- How should we see Brad's son, Erin? He is a delight, no doubt: a beautiful child who minds his parents, is playful, kind, polite, funny, loving. Yet...should we not be concerned that he is older than 3 and still sleeps in his mother's bed, on one visible occasion with a pacifier in his mouth? Isn't *his* bond with his mother disturbing, too? He may grow up to be a darling, sociable, harmless young man. Or we may be witnessing the raising of a Ronnie-- and we, just like his mother, are overlooking the signs and/or the flaws of our own parenting methods.If *Dogville* is unbearably truthful, complex, odd, profound in every sense of the word, controversial, so human it is nearly unwatchable, *Little Children* is psychologically lethal.Watch this film. Twice. Twenty times. Carefully. Let it murder you if it must. Chances are that it's not for you. You may not bear much or any of it at all. You will not notice most of its intricacies, and then you will see ones that anyone but you would be blind to.But whatever you do, do NOT be deceived that this is like anything you've ever seen. Do NOT assume expectations or prejudices. Do not let the opening playground scene fool you or bore you. Notice the smudged eyeliner and caked mascara on the only made-up mother-- the queen bee of the PTA-- and recognize that this film isn't Hollywood.

Please don't be deceived by the sexy poster for this film or it's nominations. The lines that Kate Winslet was forced to utter was too much to bear. Kate Winslet did the best she could with what she was given, but all of the other cast members were terrible. Not one conversation was natural or believable. There was the one plot where Sarah (Kate Winslet) and Brad, whom the other desperate housewives have cleverly dubbed the ""Prom King,"" begin an extramarital affair. They end up ""falling for each other"" but their relationship has absolutely no meaning. They don't have one intelligent conversation and don't know one another in the least. Then there's the sub-plot when a new neighbor moves into suburbia and shatters the neighborhood. His crime? Indecent exposure. Everyone wants him castrated. At the public pool he shows up with his snorkeling gear and takes a peek at the children underwater. What ensues is a scene reminiscent of Jaws. A couple of the mothers notice him there and all begin screaming frantically at the pool's edge. The children are all swimming for their little children lives. Then he is alone in the pool swimming around like a little happy shark and there are perfectly formed rows of people watching him in absolute silence until the police remove him. And how does this sub-plot relate to the main plot? Well, it doesn't. And how do the writers get away with this? Well, they don't. The story of Ronnie the pedophile is just filler and spice which leaves you feeling sick with a bad taste in your mouth.

To refer to this movie as an unfortunate example of the pretentious nonsense that flows out places like the NYU Film School doesn't even begin to describe the immaturity of the product on the screen. The writing is adolescent. Although there is the heavy hand of a director present throughout the film, the story has no core, no direction. The characters are one dimensional, caricatures of adults as seen through a teenager's lens. In all, it is an utterly shallow and misguided presentation of adult concerns. The only saving grace is the acting--and the actors simply could not save this film from itself.

The only thing going for them was that their neighbours are even more dense. The implausible bits in the plot made the movie questionable overall. The author does not seem to know much about the criminal justice system - the ""pedophile"" was arrested for exposure. These are quite different conditions, but putting that aside, there would have been conditions on his release that would have prohibited him from living across from a playground. OK, I put that down to lax research on the author's part, but the movie really fell apart for me when this guy showed up at the pool - his picture is plastered all over town - and no one recognizes him! The only single male there, and the only one with snorkel equipment - give me a break! But it turns out to be a plot device allowing the Kate Winslett character to be the hero (probably the only time in her life) as she shouts out and the pool is cleared. The pedophile dates a woman with serious mental illness problems? Oh sure, whatever.... The children start napping over at Kate's house but don't tell the other parent? - Unlikely. Book club members calling the younger members ""little sisters""? - give me a break. The lovers meeting for their getaway after dark in the playground? Seems odd to me, but even more unlikely is the mother pushing her child on the swing, spots the pedophile entering the park, and doesn't pick up her child and leave immediately?

Her work in this film acting opposite Patrick Wilson is enticing, realistic and exciting. A true chemistry exists between these two characters and you end up feeling drawn into their lives, wanting more with the true sense of knowing them, these real people.The haunting undertone of the inevitable truth that we all have a tragic flaw presents itself throughout the film, from our lust and desire through to the inescapable want to recreate our adolescence.

I really enjoyed though the naked body of Patrick Wilson making love to Kate. The best thing of this movie consists for me in the way how the scene flow suddenly stops, when it seems to end really tragically. Also director managed to enter each status of every single character in the movie, which are all so different for the same object (like Ronnie, which is in the eyes of his mother nice and sensitive person and for the others just dangerous maniac).

286,steinhagen-1,very annoying and childish!,1,19 October 2007,"this film was one of the worst ""serious"" films I saw the last years: not only that the story jumps from one unrealistic, hysterical, embarrassing, thus painful Outburst to the next, the worst thing is the strictly designed (false) Moral: if you dare to fall in Love though you are married with a more beautiful woman with even definitely longer legs, you will be punished and brought back to reasons by an almost lethal accident. If you fall in Love 'cause your husband sniffs on strange & paid other's panties, destiny will have Mercy on you.

Our society is no different than any other in that we are given, in each encounter in our lives, an opportunity to enrich our lives and the lives of the ones we care about. What we do with each of those opportunities is up to the individual. Little Children could have positioned itself as an arbiter of ethics, understanding and love but instead chose to produce a weak satire of ""daily life"". There was a distinct anger lodged at the life these people live with no validation as to why.

288,missionguy,Hamhanded Hollywood morality play,2,17 May 2007,"In the spirit of ""Grand Canyon"" and ""American Beauty,"" this is an overwrought epic about sex panic in America. While it's good to have conversations about sexuality, monogamy and the treatment of people convicted of sex crimes, the writing in this script is so wooden that the result is nearly unbearable. There's actually a voice-over narration with a cheesy male voice that begs the question ""Is this a satire?"" I kept waiting for the irony to break through, but it doesn't. It becomes clear that this is Hollywood congratulating itself for taking on large social issues, albeit only the concerns of suburban rich white people.The voice over is over the top. Kate Winslet will be looking off into the mist and there will be a voice over saying something like ""Sarah thought about her life with her husband. She wasn't happy."" Things that are so basic and emotional, the sort of things that should be adapted into dialogue or acting. Voice overs should only be used if the writing voice is extraordinary (it isn't) or there is some sort of satirical bent (there isn't).The film takes on the tenor of a B-grade horror movie taking itself way too seriously. The final scenes, where Ronnie, the man arrested for exposing himself to a minor, completely reverts to childlike, faux-retarded behavior and smashes his mother's menagerie of glass figurines. Tennessee Williams this is not. When he castrates himself at the end, I actually groaned out loud. Naturally, since it's Hollywood, everything is restored to the status quo at the end. Everyone has an epiphany and sees the light and goes back to their unhappy marriages. I was dumbfounded! I kept thinking about all those people on Oscar night  the voters and the people involved with this film and all the critics who gave this movie its reputation  actually cooperating with this idea that THIS is the best Hollywood can do in terms of social commentary. ""In the Bedroom"" was a very different movie, but mostly because there were better actors and a basis of solid writing by Andre Dubus. This script and the book it was based on are the lowest common denominator. Shame on Hollywood for peddling such crap.This is an update on 1950s sexual hysteria.

289,highbrow-movie-viewer,"Surprised at how weak it was, especially given the strong cast",3,26 June 2007,"While I'm usually very tolerant of just OK movies, I found this one very hard to sit through. I liked the premise that everyone has good and bad characteristics and that people can be either criminals or heroes depending on the circumstance. Unfortunately this theme, which has the potential to be so powerful, was so poorly executed that I just couldn't believe any of the story.Who directed these actors? There is absolutely no believability or subtlety in the reactions of any of the characters to the situations in which they find themselves. Are we really expected to believe that a woman, upon realizing that her husband is having an affair with the other woman at her dinner table, would sit there with an aghast look on her face staring from one to the other - and then crawl under the table for an indefinitely long period of time and shout ""just a minute"" when asked if she's OK?When women disapprove of each other's parenting, do they tend to act like vicious teenagers? Do people open other people's private diaries and just happen to find entries pertaining to themselves while the owner is standing in the next room? Is it believable that someone could be secretly in the process of mutilating themselves with no outward sign of what they're doing? Is it likely that Kate Winslet's character would be married to her husband?For the entire length of the movie, I couldn't for a minute forget the fact that I was watching a story trying desperately to make sense. The most distressing thing to me about this movie is that it is considered by the movie-going public as so profound as to receive glowing reviews. We should have higher standards than that.",Little Children
290,svarkonda,stupidest movie ever seen,1,31 July 2007,"what a ridiculous commentary on self absorption. comments about the suburbanite who fills her boring time with an affair with a married man as if this is meaningful or courageous of her. Gee, that is liberating and that is freedom. How courageous of her. and then to have the gall to compare a policeman who makes a bad judgment call and kills an innocent teen to a sexual predator - how far off course can you go? I don't believe sexual predators should be castrated or harassed illegally...but people should be aware if one is living in their neighborhood. the policeman made a bad choice and there is a price to pay but a sexual predator is a disease that cannot be cured...the one shining light is that the character in the movie knew that he would never stop on his own - so he made it physically impossible to act on his impulses. And talk about stereotyping 'stay at home' moms. as if they have no life other than their children and that must be horrible. good mom's make sacrifices for their children but this does not mean that they are sucked dry of a life. it is entirely possible to be happy because you are sacrificing and doing what is best for your children.

291,delaveri,Absolute Brilliance,10,20 December 2007,"This movie was such an amazing cross-section of the Suburban-American psyche! No piece of cinema has ever made me feel this way before. The film portrays the seemingly calm and ""perfect"" neighborhood facade so well. All too often I feel that we detach ourselves from not only our neighbors but our friends, children, and spouses. This superficial way of life has so many flaws which are so well illustrated in this movie. It begins with the occasional discomforting twist here and there. You find yourself justifying actions from characters that you know are wrong but it is set up so that you sympathize with them. Then as if you weren't uncomfortable enough, that character which you have found identity with and/or sympathy goes and does something that completely throws you off and their true flaws are revealed to you. You then find yourself conflicted, wanting peace, and resolution, but the story continues to twist itself. Finally, only when you think you cannot bare much more, within the last 5-10 minutes, you recognize the message. You have survived! The hope is found. You realize that the hope lies within honesty and truth. It is the judgments which we make and very things we despise which we find within ourselves. That is why we hate it, because we know it so well. Instead of helping, we try our hardest to hurt it, so it won't harm others. In turn we only end up hurting ourselves. I realize that this may come off as such a huge rant but I promise that it is very relevant to this movie. I hope that everyone is able to get as much out of this movie as I have. I encourage you to read the book, too! From what I've read so far, it's even better than the movie!",Little Children

Kate Winslet as Sarah & Brad, their love is only like that way.That's the reason why this movie lost the Catharsis in the end. They should've crossed over the line to Crazy love.English Author J.G.Ballard, he often had picked up same theme as this movie's.It is Sick of Suburbans. Their Perfectionism, cling to took every little piece of Danger away from their Peace kingdom.J.G.Ballard wrote like ""what is the only way out of that perfect residence? it's just Craziness"" in ""Running Wild"". They're embodied core Distortion of recent world.By the way this movie well described Insanity of New England Suburbans. In early scene Sarah & house wives circle got Park to watch their children's play. Then Brad & little son come there and Sarah got know that wives called him Prom King with affection but they never had talked with him for so long. That Sweet exclusivity let Sarah reach out to Brad. There's also really Awesome scene involved. That's JAWS in pool. Ronny: ex jailed pedophile guy, one fine day he got into the city Pool where so many kids played thus all of them quickly jump up from water in order to their parents warning.After that Ronny all alone go swim bottom of vast pool in a moment, that's so Breathtaking scene. He seems like JAWS, but in fact he's just a Skinny bald guy at 40's. That tells us how huge Obsession Suburbans have under their Perfect life.By the way Ronny is main chara, it's so Challenging cast but it seems to me just as failed. He is Pedophile sex offender although he doesn't enough describe to attend viewer's sympathy. Ronny describes as just a creepy mother's boy, it's Crucial mistake.An ex cop is also in main, he'd been tried to exile Ronny from his region then he indirectly killed Ronny's Mother. But in the end they gotta real Human Bond. However I can't let my emotion in cause they didn't show any attraction by their personality until that moment.And I wrote again Sarah & Brad, Climax of their romance is just a NO no no. Why Brad gotta attention to Sk8er bois in the middle of running to meet run away lover: Sarah.Director would be show that Brad is just a Childish guy not ready for run away love. But it's nonsense plot twist.It'd much better to complete their run away that's Absolute thing for the end of this movie. If it'd so that this movie could be expose extra inhumanity by Suburbans those who's upon the Dictator ship called perfect life.

293,chocobotkid,Superb,10,22 September 2006,"I had the pleasure of seeing the premiere of ""Little Children"" at Telluride. The incomprable Mr.Feild hid behind the curtain near the concession at the back of the Nugget Theater wringing his hands, looking a wee bit nauseous. It was all very endearing. The film is superb. Amongst the American fare it tops my list of films fromTelluride, next to the incomprable 'Day Night Day Night' directed by Julia Loktev. For me, it was all about Jackie Earle Haley. Haley sneaks onto the screen 45 minutes into the narrative bursting the happy bubble of familiar ups and downs of married with children life. The result unnerving edgy tension that could be cut with a knife. Haley's performance is vulnerable, awkward and possibly the strongest male role to light up the screen this year. Haley deserves accolades, praise and loads of attention. He's been a favorite darling of mine for ages...something I had the good fortune of recounting to Feild after the screening. Feild provides many questions and very few answers. Haley's character may have been released from jail for indecent exposure to a minor, yet Feild does a delicate balancing act without faltering on the side of ""good guy/ bad guy"". This is NOT a film about pedophiles. This is a film about faults, judgments, weaknesses that consume, chew one up and spits you out again. And in the end the entire paradigm of suburban life has been twisted, shaken, pushed and pulled.There is tragedy, openness, shifts, that do not add up to ultimate conclusions. This complex tale weaves passion, disillusionment, love, lust, desire, ambivalence. But most importantly, the tender web of Mother-Child relations, WITHOUT ever vilifying Mother. Feild breaks from this poisonous, obsessive, castrating, oedipal mother-subject paradigm and addresses the people who float in and out of crisis above and beyond being tied to their social roles and traditional moral codes. Winslet encapsulates the awkward intellectual mom, who loves her daughter, but has very very human ambivalence towards this 24/7 duty of unconditional love/acceptance and never ending giving. Finally, she decides to give something back to herself, by playing out a torrid love affair with the Prom King (Patrick Wilson) another character ripe with flaws and exudes humanness. This should win many many many accolades for 2006, it's a rare stand out. A powerful disturbingly familiar tale played out eloquently, and held at benign distance via the brilliant use of odd narration. It's a strange convention, but Feild masters this as he skewers and satirizes and describes it's subjects with authority. The narration was pleasantly reminiscent of ""Fishing with John"", often obvious, but nicely pushing the plot along with often more than a hint of humor. The serious tone of the narrator serves to punctuate the utter ridiculous paradox of the banalities of being 'married with children' and having a flashy adventurous love affair in and around the locations of everyday stay at home summer existence; the park, the pool, the evening football game.The Affair never reveals itself as the be-all-and-end-all, answer to disillusionment and sadness of suburban middle class marriage. Nor, the cause-effect that sets the plot in motion. Even more satisfyingly, the affair does not legitimate the happy normative narrative ending.",Little Children

I mention the minor players just to emphasize how well developed every character is. For me, the most tragic figure is Sarah.

There have been a lot of movies/shows about suburbanitic desperation (The Ice Storm, Desperate Housewives to name a very, very few)... and I didn't find this too, too noteworthy, and in fact, the kind of cut-scene/split scene thing it had going on at some points was kind of silly, and unnecessary.

One briefly reappears at a book club to cue in Winslett to describe Madame Bouvery in feminist terms (and of course the plot of the film in case you weren't getting it), but then exit book club. Winslett has problems with husband... exit husband. Guy is about to take bar exam, but meets Winslett... exit bar exam.

Which is just as well because Winslett seems to have been struck blind when a staggering pervert walks past her and she fails to notice the blood from his self castration. At this point she has to go in search of her child who has obviously read the rest of the script and decided to exit. Now its obvious the title is a reference to the emotional infantilism that has infected these people but they do not stand out in... Boston as depicted in the film.

302,HeavenlyWinslet,"Superb drama, outstanding performances, direction and writing",9,26 May 2007,"Director Todd Field's second feature film is one of the finest of 2006 and a superb adaptation of the Tom Perrotta novel. Set in a suburb of Boston, the film focuses on a handful of characters who all eventually interconnect in unexpected ways. An engrossing exploration of adult behaviour, sexual tension, isolation, prejudice, parenting and suburban angst, Little Children is an incredibly provocative, unusual and honest motion picture.Told by an omniscient narrator, the film charts the story of two unhappily married people, Sarah Pierce and Brad Adamson who begin a secretive affair out of a mutual longing for connection. Sarah is a frustrated intellectual who thinks of herself as an anthropologist due to her exasperation towards the gossipy mothers in the neighbourhood and does not much understand her needy daughter either. Her emotional life is particularly stunted, as her husband Richard indulges in pornography while Sarah spends her days caring for her daughter, all the while yearning for an alternative and wondering how she came to be like this at all.Brad is married to Kathy, a documentary maker who is more than a little upset that she is the sole breadwinner and constantly urges Brad to study for the bar exam, which he has failed twice, though he spends that time observing teen skateboarders and yearning for his lost youth.Into their midst comes recently released sex offender Ronald McGorvey who initiates the community's feelings of anxiety, especially those of ex-cop Larry Hedges who begins a hate campaign against McGorvey as a way of venting his own anger and loneliness.As the film progresses, we begin to understand that the title does not refer to the children but to the adults who behave irresponsibly, recklessly and selfishly.Brad and Sarah's affair is a way of temporarily filling a void in their lives created by their unsatisfying marriages.The film also portrays the heavy burden the children place on their parents and how the parent's personal happiness is thus prevented.Little Children is admirably carried by the ever outstanding and fearless Kate Winslet, who gives a performance of such honesty, nuance, intelligence and transformation, inhabiting Sarah and registering every requisite emotion her character experiences, completely justifying her fifth Academy Award nomination.The fluid cinematography and melancholy score ensure that the film's suburbia is constantly suspended in a dream like state and the audience is fully absorbed in this world of placid town pools, playgrounds, seemingly perfect families and expensive houses, but which ultimately prove a fragile facade to the dark struggles of its inhabitants, the marital and parental imperfection, the sharp paranoia.The equally excellent screenplay, which may bother some with its ever changing tone, is by turns acerbic, haunting, well-observed, heartbreaking, dark, uncomfortable and deeply satirical. The flaws lie in the underwritten characters of Brad's wife and Sarah's husband, who is especially absent for much of the film. I also thought the film could have benefited from being slightly longer, in order to grant a more satisfying conclusion.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Little Children and although I mostly saw it for being a huge Kate fan, it is totally recommended for those who appreciate challenging film-making which reminds us of how quick we are to judge others and ourselves and ultimately how we are all little children in the end.",Little Children

The acting in this movie is top quality, and I was pleasantly surprised with the acting by the young actors as well. The Oscar nominations are well deserved.

To oversimplify, how US citizens tend to divide into good and evil, right and wrong, see things in black and white, have a conservative take on the marriage, and putting people into categories.

305,StevensonLivesInTheory,Not so little children ... *spiolers*!!!,9,19 October 2006,"As if Todd Field's In the Bedroom wasn't enough, he comes back with his next installment of twisted plots and even more twisted families. Todd Field Co-Adapts Tom Perrotas novel and does a terrific job. With an all-star cast, Little Children turns out to be the best picture I've seen all year since Half-Nelson. Kate Winslet plays Sarah; a stay at home mom taking care of her of her 4 year old daughter played by the adorable Sadie Goldstein. Every single story in this movie is different, yet each of them ferociously connects. Sarah is the UN-happy wife if Richard, played by Gregg Edelman. Richard alienates himself from his wife and kid. Instead of spending his free time playing with his daughter, he chooses to begin an obsession with an internet porn model. In return, Sarah is forced to spend every waking minute with her daughter. As in the opening scene shows, Sarah is at the park with her daughter. She shows no interest or acknowledgment of her daughter. Sarah has other problems that overpower her daughter. She is different from the other mothers at the park. They are all Tupperware and Cardigans and she is neither. Little did she know all that would change with the return of Brad, played by a terrific Patrick Wilson. Brad is also a stay at home dad whose wife Kathy, played by Jennifer Connelly is a documentary maker who Brad insists wear's the ""pants"" in the house. There relationship is secretly taking a wrong turn due to Kathy's constant nagging at Brad to take his bar exam again. Brad has already failed this exam twice. So as a gesture to get Kathy off his back he leaves every night and says he's going to the library. But surprisingly he always gets sidetracked at the local park where he watches young teens skate. As an excuse to get closer with Brad, Sarah brings her daughter to play with Brad's son. This is an obvious excuse for Sarah to hit on Brad and for Brad to fantasize about being with a woman who's not his wife. This escalates to a dangerous and adulterous affair.That's only the beginning. Things really begin to shake up when recently released pedophile Ronald McGovern moves in to town. Ronald, played by Jackie Earle Haley (Former child star, Bad news Bears) lives with his mother and endures tremendous criticism over his ""disease"". In my opinion everything works in this movie. The performances given from Patrick Wilson, Kate Winslet and Jennifer Connelly are amazing and will not be forgotten come Oscar time. But a performance that stands out to me is Jackie Earle Haley playing Ronald the Pedophile. Another thing that works great is the narration from Frontline host Will Lyman. Even as the story unfolds and takes a drastic turn, Will Lyman's hilarious and rather obnoxious voice still stays calm.Little Children is a mixture of two Best Picture winners; American Beauty and Crash. With the irony of Crash and the brutal honesty of adulthood in suburbia made famous by American Beauty, Little Children is a sure Oscar Contender and a terrific film. This one should not be missed. Favorite Quote  ""It's the hunger, hunger for an alternative and the refusal to accept a life of unhappiness."" Sarah Pierce",Little Children
