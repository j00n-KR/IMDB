0,MartinHafer,"To really enjoy this film, you need to love indie music and have a high tolerance for things icky",7,28 July 2011,"Each of the last several years, I have tried to watch all the Oscar nominees for Best Picture. Of last years' crop, ""127 Hours"" was the last I watched—and I dreaded it. After all, a real-life story about a guy who falls down a canyon and needed to saw off his own hand to survive is NOT the sort of movie I would rush out to see! Heck, ""Winter's Bone"" was practically a comedy compared to ""127 Hours""! Yes, it was unpleasant, as it includes scenes involving the main character drinking urine, cutting off his hand (it wasn't THAT graphic) and all the blood make for a tough to watch film.The film was co-written and directed by Danny Boyle—the guy who brought the world the Best Picture winner ""Slumdog Millionaire"". While I wasn't that thrilled with the screenplay (after all, the story is extremely simple and the film seems heavily padded to make it full length), I was impressed by a lot of the inventive camera-work and direction. But the story, overuse of indie-style music (which is great if you are a hipster—I certainly am NOT) and the gore makes it a hard sell for me and probably most out there. This film is definitely a niche film that is not for everyone.By the way, this story is to have taken place over a period lasting more than four days. Then why is it the guy ALWAYS seems to have his camcorder on?! What brand is this that has a 127 hour-plus capacity?! I'd sure like to buy that one!",127 Hours
1,TheLittleSongbird,Another interesting(and excellent) film from Danny Boyle,8,4 September 2011,"I have enjoyed Danny Boyle's work, though I found myself let down by Sunshine, so naturally I was all for seeing 127 Hours. I thought it was excellent and very interestingly done. I think the movie could have been a tad longer, but that in mind, 127 Hours is a superb-looking movie, definitely one of the best-looking and impressive movies of 2010 in my eyes. I just loved the wonderful cinematography and landscapes and also the kinetic editing and visual effects. The story is compelling and well paced, beautifully put together by well staged and thoughtfully thought out flashbacks and hallucinations. The music is fitting and dynamic, the conclusion is harrowing and I think heart-wrenching and a lot of effort is taken into making the audience empathise with Ralston. Other than the technical aspects, what really stood out about 127 Hours was Boyle's superb direction, it is wonderfully tight throughout, and the mesmerising tour-de-force that is James Franco's lead performance. All in all, excellent. 8/10 Bethany Cox",127 Hours
2,Leofwine_draca,Great 'trapped in a single location' film,7,26 January 2012,"I'm a sucker for these types of films: you know, where one or more characters are stuck in a situation and have to use their brains to get out of it. Films like CUBE, FROZEN, some parts of the SAW series, hell, even going back to the '80s with the likes of EVIL DEAD 2, I love the freedom that one or a small group of actors on a single set brings.The much-hyped 127 HOURS comes to us based on a true story, which has both good and bad points. The good side is that it enhances the 'it could happen to you' feeling while you're watching. The bad side is that most viewers will already know the ending before they start watching.Nevertheless, this turns out to be a great and gripping movie, even if I did know what happened beforehand. Danny Boyle, who I haven't always liked in the past (I hate TRAINSPOTTING with a vengeance), manages to keep the film pacey and engaging despite not much happening for the duration. He uses frenetic camera-work, flashbacks, monologues and snapshots of the beautiful, arid locales to great effect.This is a film that emphasises realism above all else, and again, there are good and bad sides to that. James Franco (delivering a solid performance) plays a guy who isn't exactly likable or sympathetic, yet that serves to make the tale that unfolds all the more believable. Yes, 127 HOURS contains one of the most excruciating sequences ever put on film, but it's not really about the visceral side of the experience: it's instead a great psychological study of the human mind put in a situation with seemingly no way out.",127 Hours
3,SnoopyStyle,impressive work from Boyle and Franco,8,18 July 2015,"It's 2003. Aron Ralston (James Franco) goes out into the desert to do some bike riding and rock climbing. He encounters hikers Kristi (Kate Mara) and Megan (Amber Tamblyn). The girls invite him to a party the next day but as he continues his hike alone, he falls down a crevice and gets his hand stuck under a boulder. It's 127 hours of struggle as he tries in vain and finally decides to cut off his arm.On the surface, this is not a very cinematic story. The guy is stuck in a crevice. It doesn't allow for much movement. The three people falling through the rocks is a fun opening. Then Danny Boyle does everything to garner interesting visuals. Franco is very effective in what is essentially an one-man play in much of the movie. It's an impressive piece of work from both Franco and Boyle.",127 Hours
4,claudio_carvalho,Heartbreaking Story of Courage and Determination,7,20 June 2011,"On April 2003, the engineer, climber and canyoneer Aron Ralston (James Franco) travels to Blue John Canyon without telling anyone to spend the weekend doing what he likes to do: climb the isolated canyon. He meets the teenagers Kristi (Kate Mara) and Megan (Amber Tamblyn) that are lost and they spend a couple of hours together bathing in a lake in a cave. He says goodbye to them and while descending a canyon crack, a chockstone comes loose rolling onto his arm. Aron realizes that he is stuck and he tries to find a way to release the stone. Along five days short of water and without food, Aron becomes delusional and recalls his family and friends. After the fifth day, he decides to sever his forearm to survive. ""127 Hours"" is the heartbreaking story of courage and determination relative to the accident of Aron Ralston while climbing Blue John Canyon. James Franco has an awesome performance in the role of Aron and my only remark is that this film could have been a little shorter. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""127 Horas"" (""127 Hours"")",127 Hours
5,kosmasp,Giving up,8,25 November 2011,"I try to have as little knowledge about movies I am about to watch as possible. It was impossible though, to not get the one big incident in the movie. Everyone was talking about it and he even made a skit for comedy show (I think it was for Jon Stewarts Show), where it was obvious what he was going to make.But if you watch the movie, you will understand that it's not a big secret anyway. It's almost the first thing he does anyway. Though it doesn't happen. Apart from this really big incident, you might wonder what the movie will be about. And how trapped it will feel (remember Buried?). And you will be surprised that while you might feel closed in, there is also quite a few sequences where the mind wanders ... and I have to admit, I never thought he (Danny Boyle, director) would make those bold choices (visually speaking). I'm even more surprised that the Academy would give this more than one nod (though ultimately it didn't win).Very intense drama, about being trapped and not having a way out. But still having the will to live through it ... But is it enough? Watch and see for yourself",127 Hours
6,classicsoncall,"""I'm in pretty deep doo-doo here.""",8,14 July 2012,"I knew the story well enough when it happened, but didn't commit to the film when it came out because of the subject matter. I'm not keen on self mutilation and frankly, I get queasy just thinking about cutting one of my own limbs off. But there was a larger story here that compelled me to pick up the film today and give it a shot. There had to be some inspirational take-away from a movie about a man who was forced to make a supreme sacrifice in order to survive, and in that respect, the picture is one of hope and triumph against all odds. I'm not going to be one of those bashers who condemn Aron Ralston (James Franco) for abandoning better judgment on that fateful day, even though I did find it odd that he had all that technical gadgetry and no cell phone. If I'm Aron Ralston, I'm kissing the ground I walk on every day for the rest of my life, content in the knowledge that there exists a Higher Power and a role we're given in life to be an inspiration to others.",127 Hours
7,gavin6942,Second-Tier But Still Great 2010 Film,7,13 January 2011,"Aron Ralston (James Franco) is an amateur mountain climber. After setting out on his own, and not telling anyone where he went, he finds himself in the most awful of tragedies: his arm is trapped under a rock, and there is no possible way to call for help. What lengths will he go to in order to survive? The story is familiar to anyone who has followed the news in the last ten years. But here we are given a closer look than we ever thought possible. And if you are wondering if it is possible to make a film about a man who does not move and has no one to talk to for 127 hours, it can be done, and be done in style.I do not think Danny Boyle was the right man for the job on this one. Not to say he did a bad job -- he did not -- but he has a unique style that I think this film did not need. There are a lot of colorful things that need not be there. Some may like this.I also do not think Franco was given a full range to work with. That being said, I would still give him a best actor nomination, even if he would not win. It is not often that one man can carry a whole film, and he did it. He had to, and he did. I never got bored despite the very limited scenery.This is a bit more of an artsy film and will not gain the amount of attention that other films -- ""Inception"" and ""Social Network"" -- will get. And it is not Boyle's best film, certainly. But if you have an urge to see Boyle's latest film, or one of the top films of 2010, make this a must-see.",127 Hours
8,lee_eisenberg,Don't go hiking alone!,10,3 May 2012,"I had first learned of Aron Ralston when he appeared on a talk show and told of his harrowing experience. Now that I've seen ""127 Hours"", I can tell you that it's also a harrowing experience. Not just an excuse for shock value, the movie is basically about the will to survive in the most dire situations. The movie is also about how Ralston changes. Starting out as a footloose, extreme mountain climber, his humanity becomes apparent as he realizes that there's only one way out of his predicament.James Franco plays Ralston to a tee, showing the man start to go delirious as he eventually decides on drastic measures. Much of the credit also goes to cinematographers Anthony Dod Mantle and Enrique Chediak, who create just about every angle in the confined space where Ralston finds himself trapped by the boulder, emphasizing his feeling of desperation.All in all, if ever there was a movie about the triumph of the human spirit, this has to be it. Those five days in that slot canyon in the middle nowhere truly put the carefree Ralston's fragility to the test. I wholly recommend the movie.",127 Hours
9,jboothmillard,127 Hours,8,16 January 2011,"From BAFTA nominated director Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, 28 Days Later, Slumdog Millionaire), I had seen him talking about this film he was making on Film 2010 with Jonathan Ross, and it sounded very interesting. Based on the true story, it is 2003, Aron Ralston (Spider-Man's Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated James Franco) was an adventurer, and his favourite hobby was mountain climbing, so he plans his next trip to the isolated Canyonlands National Park of Utah, with its many smooth rock faces, slopes and caverns. He has not told anyone he knows where he is going, and the last two people to be hanging around with Aron in the canyon were Megan McBride (Amber Tamblyn) and Kristi Moore (Kate Mara). Soon after leaving the girls Aron continues climbing, and exploring the Blue John Canyon, when he slips, dislodging a large rock boulder which crushed his right forearm, pinning it to the canyon wall. So begins the 127 hours, i.e. Five days and seven hours, of the title, the total amount of time he was trapped without anyone around to rescue him and knowing no-one will be looking for him. With his left arm free Aron tries to find ways to try and release his already helpless arm from the rock, or dislodge the rock, using any strength or tools he has at his disposal. While doing this he occasionally films himself on his digital camera, drinks the very little water he has left, and eating the food he has little of. Aron eventually finishes the water and forces himself to drink his own urine, and as the time gets slower he also has small flashback and flash-forward visions of the girlfriend he left, before leaving for Utah, the girls he met, and what he could have been doing. Beleiving he will soon die he films his goodbyes to his family in case the footage is found, and he carves his birth and supposed death date on the cavern wall. Dehydrated and delirious Aron finally made the dramatic decision to get himself out bu using a rope to tourniquet (stop any bleeding) and his small tool knife to cut through the elbow area and break free. Once he worked his way outside, he made his way down the cliffs and with not much energy he does manage to get the attention of some people nearby, who give him water, and call a helicopter to rescue him. The final end credits, featuring the real Aron Ralston, said that he got married, had a child, and from now on always make sure to let everyone know where he is going. Also starring Clémence Poésy as Rana, Lizzy Caplan as Sonja Ralston, Treat Williams as Aron's Dad and Kate Burton as Aron's Mom. You could say this is a near one person movie, like Cast Away before, only it is based on reality, with a fantastic performance by Franco in a film that relies on great editing and some moving music, you do have to squeamish gory arm removal, but it doesn't make any difference to the entertainment you will get from this mesmerising true story drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Motion Picture of the Year, Best Editing, Best Music, Original Score for A. R. Rahman, Best Song for ""If I Rise"" by Dido, and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, it was nominated the BAFTAs for the Alexander Korda Award for Outstanding British Film of the Year, the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Original Score, and Best Screenplay. Very good!",127 Hours
10,ccthemovieman-1,Creative Directing,8,6 April 2011,"I wondered how filmmakers were going to keep the viewers interested in a guy stuck in crevice for five days. I found out: unique photography, a little humor here and there, a little romance, a little family sentiment, and a great job by both lead actor James Franco and director Danny Boyle.The two combined to make much more of what could have been a boring film. They kept it interesting all the way.It all added up to an entertaining film, not something I'd watch a number of times but one I'm glad I rented. This is a special treat in high-def, too, with the amazing Utah scenery and the unique camera shots by Boyle. That includes a number of split-screens and other creative stuff.",127 Hours

He is as bland here as we was as the emcee on the 83rd annual Academy Awards show.What excitement? Unfortunately, a man's hand gets trapped in a gorge and he spends 1 1/2 hours trying to free himself. He videotapes himself in the process as he thinks back to former times, which of course had to be better.We really don't have to know about his biological experiences during all this. Safe to say that it's all down-right disgusting.Who told him to go on such a desolate journey to begin with? This story, while true, is basically another Robinson Crusoe.

12,sunwarrior13,Appreciation Of Life And Survival,10,5 November 2014,"127 Hours is a film that is based on the life of Aron Ralston,a real-life canyoneer that was trapped by a boulder in an isolated slot canyon located at Blue John Canyon in Utah back in 2003.It stars James Franco as Ralston together with Amber Tamblyn and Kate Mara.It was adapted from the personal memoir of the canyoneer entitled Between A Rock And A Hard Place; and it was co-written,co- produced and directed by Danny Boyle.This is an inspiring story of Aron Ralston's adventure when he becomes trapped in a fallen boulder that crashes on his arm and traps him in isolation.As he tries to escape from his predicament in the next five days,he also discovers virtues that he did not know that he possess such as courage to survive and the ability to escape himself by any means necessary by managing an escape from a trapped 65 foot wall and to ability to hike over 8 miles before he is finally rescued.During the course of his journey,he also realized the value of the people around him like friends,lovers,family and the last two people he had the chance to meet.The movie was definitely touching and truly remarkable as the viewer will definitely appreciate what life is all about.Added to that,we also manage to learn from it that the trials,sufferings and difficulties aren't experienced to put us down but to makes us stronger and better as a human being.Added to that,we also realize that they also provide us opportunities to discover virtues that we once never had as experienced by Ralston who was trapped and experiencing manic desperation. James Franco truly captured what it is to be in that situation and the film made it possible to transform the conditions that he is into realistically. This is definitely one of the best films ever released during its theatrical release and it will remain to be one for many years to come.",127 Hours
13,Theo Robertson,We're Still Waiting For Boyle's Masterwork,6,7 January 2011,"Danny Boyle can be a very frustrating film maker . SHALLOW GRAVE was made on a total shoestring and perhaps it was this that caused it to be hype . TRAINSPOTTING was considered an unflimable novel but Boyle had a good try though he was helped by Robert Carlyle's show stopping performance as Begbie . 28 DAYS LATER had a rather derivative and illogical screenplay by Alex Garland but Boyle rose above it to make what is considered a genre masterpiece . SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is one of the most unlikely success stories in modern cinema , a story revolving around karma , set in India with an unknown cast that the whole world fell in love with . He has had a few misses however . A LIFE LESS ORDINARY was way below ordinary , THE BEACH showed Boyle isn't suited to Hollywood style film making while SUNSHINE proved he's not suited to space opera either . Despite all this you're always expecting Boyle to come up with a masterwork that will get the whole world falling back in awe . He closest to this with SM but I always think his masterwork is still to come 127 DAYS is based on the true life incident of Aron Halston , a young man who while hiking through the Utah desert fell down a crevice and had his arm trapped by a boulder and who had to take the most extreme measures to save his life . On the surface this is one of these movies award ceremonies love - courage in the face of adversity , but not something that will set the box office alight . In many ways it's something ready made for Boyle . It's not something that can be termed blockbuster but perhaps the director could weave film making magic out of it . Does he succeed ? First of all the trailer is slightly misleading . It seems similar to THE BEACH where some American dude teams up with a couple of hot chicks and does some seriously partying . Thankfully the film deviates away the marketing and concentrates on Ralston's trauma of being trapped . You're left thinking this is for the best since Ralston come across a little bit too sure of himself , a little bit too smart and a little too popular with hot chicks to get the audience entirely on his side so Boyle and screenwriter Simon Beauefoy deservesome credit in to making him something of an everyman who has dreams , ambitions and family This approach works well but the problem with the movie is that the whole premise doesn't comfortably lend itself to commercial film making . It's not an entirely involving film because the audience know the out come of the story and because the protagonist is on his own there's little dialogue and the story telling is done via obvious flashbacks to Ralston's life . The Discovery Channel does countless documentaries on these type of stories but they're rare in cinema and there might be a very obvious reason for this . There's two ways at looking at this 1 ) Boyle deserves congratulations for making an uncinematic film 2 ) The film fails because it is uncinematic The first view is totally valid but unfortunately so is the second point to a large extent As you might expect from Boyle it's impressive on a technical level with outstanding cinematography , editing and sound , though some people may quickly get fed up with the split screen technique . James Franco is impressive as Ralston and will certainly get an Oscar nomination but 127 HOURS will be one of the bridesmaids at the award season where THE KINGS SPEECH , BLACK SWAN and THE SOCIAL NETWORK will dominate while Boyle fans look forward to his next project",127 Hours
14,jotix100,Trapped,10,12 December 2010,"Having seen the trailer for ""127 Hours"" did not prepare us for the powerful impact the film had on us, as well as the audience with which we saw it. Aron Ralston amazing story is one of the most gripping accounts in memory about an episode that almost killed him. Make no mistake, this is a difficult film to sit through.A mountain climbing week-end, and exploration in the breathtaking Utah's Blue John Canyon turns into the biggest ordeal this young man had to endure. What starts as a fun time going through the rugged territory, turns into a nightmare when Aron falls into a narrow passage and a huge rock crashes his hand. Aron is left to fend for himself trying to get himself extricated from the rock that immobilized him. In spite of the nature of the story, Aron's positive attitude saves him from what would have been a sure death if he would not have been able to get out of the situation. Throughout his ordeal Aron Ralston is even able to reflect on the quality of the tools his mother had given him as a present for his activities. All he asks himself is his wisdom for not taking his reliable Swiss Army knife that must have been his companion in different trips, rather than the Chinese kit he got as a present.That Aron Ralston was able to tell his story is a document about human survival. This young man showed a courage that speaks volumes. Had he despaired with the blow he received, he certainly would not have been able to find a solution to the situation. The film is based on Aron Ralston's book ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"", adapted for the screen by the director of the film, Danny Boyle and Simon Beaufoy. The creators take us for a fantastic adventure to witness what it must have been like during those five days and seven hours that Aron almost died. In spite of the type of situation Aron endures, it is not a claustrophobic situation because, in a way, we realize Mr. Ralston had a somewhat bittersweet end in the ordeal he went through. The impressive music score by A.R. Rahman, who had worked with the director previously, adds texture to the narrative. The great camera work by Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle, gives a fantastic look to the production.James Franco is the whole picture. The actor shows his talent by capturing the essence of the man he is impersonating. One feels his anguish, his despair, his hope for survival, and his courage in dealing with a situation that for someone else might have been a tragedy impossible to overcome. Mr. Franco gives the best performance of his career.Danny Boyle loves to give his audiences bigger than life films. Well, with this one, he clearly outdid himself.",127 Hours

Much is done to give us a deep Understanding of the Psychology and Personality of this rather Boring Individual and Fails miserably to evoke any kind of Empathy or Interest. The dry barren Landscape unintentionally becomes a Metaphor for the Lame little Fellow it Imprisons.

Postcard Images and Yawn inducing Nature Shots are done with Professional competence but You can get those on the rack at the Bus Station.

16,grantss,Incredibly padded and vastly overrated,4,6 March 2014,"How on earth did this movie get nominated for six Oscars, especially Best Picture, Best Leading Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay? Pretty dull, once Ralston is trapped in the canyon. Before then, it was OK. Unfortunately the canyon scene consumes more than half the movie, and is mostly just padding. James Franco's Oscar nomination is incredibly perplexing. He spends most of the movie in one spot, staring vacantly. Considering his acting, er, ""ability"", probably the only Oscar nomination he will get, so we'll let him have his moment of glory, I guess.Would have been OK as a 45-minute TV documentary-drama. A 93-minute cinema movie - you've got to be kidding.",127 Hours
17,george.schmidt,Franco buoys this finely attuned tale of perseverance & the human spirit; Boyle & Co. do a great service to a possibly stagnant plot.,9,4 December 2010,"127 HOURS (2010) ***1/2 James Franco, Kate Mara, Amber Tamblyn, Treat Williams, Kate Burton, Lizzy Caplan. Absorbing fact-based human drama about freewheeling Aron Ralston (played with remarkable focus and depth by Franco) whose high-spirits are soon met with a devastating bluntness: while on a solo expedition in the desert wilds of Utah he is trapped – literally – between a rock and a hard place. Faced with imminent danger to his health, Ralston does everything he can to survive including (spoiler alert) remove himself by any means necessary. Filmmaker Danny Boyle's true achievement in making a possibly stagnant plot line (man in crevasse screwed for days on end) with ingenuity largely due to his creative screenplay (based on Ralston's book ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"") with Simon Beaufoy allows the viewer to see what Ralston is (and what the filmmakers have imagined as flights of fancy) buoyed by a rock solid (sorry for the pun) turn by Franco and expert work by cinematographers Enrique Chediak & Anthony Dod Mantle and crafty editing by Jon Harris. A fine depiction of facing the odds, overcoming and persevering.",127 Hours

After several days his water runs out, and he is left with only one option. Which involves a blunt penknife.I understand that the whole point of this film is in the title - the true story of Ralston's 127 hours of being trapped requires us to understand that he spent a long time on his own, struggling with various issues before coming to the immensely courageous decision he made. And James Franco's performance is very good.But did anyone else find it a bit boring? Am I out of order for wishing he'd done the deed after about 48 hours?

19,evanston_dad,Can Someone Lend James Franco a Hand?,6,23 June 2011,"Man goes hiking. Man gets pinned in canyon by boulder. Man cuts own arm off to save himself. Man lives. End of story.That's all there is to ""127 Hours,"" and director/writer Danny Boyle and co-writer Simon Beaufoy aren't able to make it about much of anything else. James Franco plays the man, and we feel bad for him in the way a normal human being would feel bad for any other human being in a similar situation. But we certainly don't feel invested in him as a character, because the material doesn't allow Franco to create one. There are some flashbacks that give us a peek into the man's life before the accident, and it's from these that we are to absorb the film's trite moral lessons (things like you should appreciate the people you love more and shouldn't take a single day for granted). But really the whole movie is really just build-up to the money shot scene, when Franco's character saws off his arm, which is admittedly pretty hard to watch but isn't really the hook on which to hang an entire movie.Boyle typically over-directs the film to within an inch of its life. The director he most reminds me of is Joel Schumacher, which -- trust me -- is not a compliment. He clearly doesn't think we as his audience have the intelligence or attention span to stick with a story that takes place in such static settings, so keeps the film constantly jittering along in a way that distracts us from the story rather than enhancing it. The only time I enjoyed his hyperactive style was during the kick-ass opening credits sequence.Grade: B-",127 Hours
20,ferguson-6,Between a Rock and the Other Place,7,18 November 2010,"Greetings again from the darkness. Spoilers are strictly avoided in my comments on movies. I completely understand that not everyone rushes out to see new releases the way that I do. For this movie, there can be no spoilers. We are all painfully aware of the real life ordeal suffered by Aron Ralston in 2003. This taut film succeeds at bringing to life the visuals our minds can only imagine.Danny Boyle is a terrific director and has three (now four) outstanding and diverse movies to his name (Slumdog Millionaire, Millions, Trainspotting). Here he re-teams with Slumdog writer Simon Beaufoy to bring us the screen version of Aron Ralston's book ""Between a Rock and Hard Place"". It's the story of an adventurous young man who is forced to take drastic measures when his arm is pinned after a fall while rock climbing.What the film really explores is Ralston's personality. A cocky, adventurous, fun-loving guy whose ""oops"" moment consisted of not telling anyone where he was headed. A cardinal sin for hikers. Five days later he stumbles back to life, minus one arm. Ralston faces one of those moments when he must decide just how important life is. He must be a courageous man because his choice leads to life ... through excruciating pain.Boyle does an amazing job in capturing the moment and the setting. In what could be a hopeless situation, Ralston clings to life. James Franco delivers an Oscar worthy performance as Ralston. His range here is remarkable. Watching his hallucinations, flashbacks and persistence makes this an extremely watchable film despite the topic.Support work is minimal but decent from Kate Mara, Amber Tamblyn, Treat Williams, Kate Burton and Clemence Poesy. Franco and Boyle are the real stars as they capture Ralston's spirit. As a viewer, this taps into our inner most fear. What if this were us? What if we were him? Could we do it? Would we do it?",127 Hours
21,anaconda-40658,One Arm Less Better Than It Could Be.,7,15 September 2015,"127 Hours (2010): Dir: Danny Boyle / Cast: James Franco, Kate Mara, Amber Tamblyn, Treat Williams, Lizzy Caplan: Agonizing film about reflection. James Franco explores the beautiful mountains but ends up trapped with his right forearm caught between a boulder and the solid rock wall. After numerous attempts to free himself including using various item from his backpack, he calculates his remaining water and then drifts into maddening reflections of an attitude that generated a sense of self reliant. He reflections upon a past failed relationship as well as remember his upbringing when his father brought him up into the mountains. Directed by Danny Boyle whose credits include Slumdog Millionaire and Trainspotting. As with those films Boyle examines his subject's sanity through stylish camera trickery. Franco pulls off a flawed performance as a self reliant climber who suddenly finds himself forced to understand his need for others. The consequences of this lesson are graphic but not career deterring. Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn are introduced as two explorers whom Franco assists when lost, then they hurdle into free spirited fun in a water pool within a tunnel. More of these two would have been great but Franco can only imagine the party they invited him too that he is missing. Treat Williams is seen briefly as his father who never says much and after his introduction he is merely seen as an image. Lizzy Caplan is featured briefly as his sister. Well crafted film about appreciating life and appreciating those who make the hours worth it. Score: 7 ½ / 10",127 Hours

Audience members were reportedly vomiting and leaving the theater during opening weekend because of the amputation scene. Very few movies have had such hype, and as I am a notoriously squeamish viewer, I heeded the advice of my brother and his friends who told me not to rent it. Since it's James Franco's week here at Hot Toasty Rag, I knew I had to rent it; how can you celebrate someone's films and ignore the one that garnered him his only Oscar nomination? I was fully prepared to hide behind my hands or my pillow and had both at the ready, but such drastic measures were never taken.The great tragedy of the film, and what makes it hard to watch, is that it's based on a true story. As you watch James Franco drink his own urine and eat his contact lenses, you're constantly reminded that someone else actually did those things. It's similar to All is Lost, a one-person drama about a man stranded in the middle of the ocean on a life raft, but with the difference that 127 Hours is not pure entertainment. It's a horrifying tragedy that makes you want to hug your loved ones very tightly.A movie like this is very tricky to master because the entire audience knows exactly what's going to happen. When we watched James Cameron's Titanic, we were so immersed in the story that even when we saw the iceberg appear, we still thought there was a chance the ship might sail around it. Every scene of 127 Hours is well-timed and well thought out, immersing us so much that even though we know what's going to happen, we're held in incredible suspense as we watch it unfold. In a film focused on an actor pinned down by a rock, the audience could easily get bored, distracted, or taken out of the drama of the scenes. Every scene is riveting and important, and you can hardly stand blinking, let alone getting distracted or looking away. The opening scene shows Franco packing his backpack as he prepares to go on a hike. We know what's going to happen, so we pay attention to his water bottle, Gatorade stash, ropes, flashlight, and of course, his pocketknife. Twice, he's seen reaching blindly on a tall shelf but unable to find his Swiss Army Knife. Filmed from inside the cabinet, the audience cringes and groans as he leaves the knife behind.The final opening title card isn't shown until 16 minutes in, at the immediate moment Franco falls down the crevice and gets pinned in by the boulder. That brief scene is so fantastic, because even though the audience has been waiting for it to happen, when it does, we get the same sinking feeling in the pit of our stomach as Franco. ""It really happened,"" we say to ourselves as he tugs and pushes in vain.A self-described ""action movie with a guy who can't move,"" 127 Hours rests entirely on James Franco's shoulders. No matter how fast-paced Jon Harris's editing, no matter how thoughtful Danny Boyle's directing, if the lead actor was unconvincing or unlikable, the movie wouldn't have worked. This is not a slice-of-life movie where a character is showcased for a few days and doesn't have to grow or change; this an exposing, grueling, emotional experience. In ninety minutes, he transforms from someone carefree, confident, sexy, and joyful to someone lonely, frightened, and doomed. Franco is seen urinating uncontrollably, saying goodbye to his parents on his camcorder, and flicking ants off his face. He reaches to feel a glimmer of sunshine with his foot with equal realism as when he admits to the camcorder that he knows when he's going to die.During the infamous scene, there was plenty of grunting, pain, struggle, and determination that would make any viewer cry out, ""Give him his Oscar for crying out loud!"" but to me, the moment of aftermath was his greatest moment in the entire film. The shock, incredulity, sorrow, regret, fear, and hope of what he's just accomplished all mingle into an indescribable three seconds. I don't know what James Franco pulled from to give that expression on his face, but the result was remarkable.Franco delivered an incredible tour-de-force performance that deserved to win an Academy Award every bit as much as Colin Firth's from The King's Speech. No one but Franco himself knows the depth of his disappointment that night, but hopefully he was a little consoled that he got beaten out by a veteran actor who turned out a great performance. 2010 was not another 1955, thank goodness.Had this movie been made a mere ten years later, I'm sure the amputation scene would have been dragged out and filmed with a far more gruesome mindset. Films have become noticeably bloodier in recent years, and I'm so glad Danny Boyle-who tragically was not even nominated for Best Director-and all involved handled the scene with such tact and care. Trust me; watching this movie will not make you vomit, and you won't need to be carried out of your home theater room in a stretcher. Rent it. You'll love this raw, powerful movie, and you probably won't be able to stop talking about it for weeks afterwards.DLM Warning: : If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie will not be your friend. Nearly every single minute of the film is shot either in split-screen, with handheld techniques, sudden movements, or odd perspective. Unfortunately it will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",127 Hours
23,FlashCallahan,This rock has been waiting for me....,7,5 March 2011,"Aron Ralston believes he's invincible and can do it all alone while on his outdoor adventures. He considers the great outdoors his second home. On Saturday, April 26, 2003, Aron has gone for an adventure trek alone through the generally secluded Blue John Canyon, and like he has done on many of his other treks, he has not told anyone where he is going. But on this day, he and a small boulder fall down a crevice, he landing near the bottom of the crevice virtually unharmed, but with his right hand wedged between the boulder and the crevice wall. He has access to his gear and his small supply of rations as he tries to move the boulder or chip away at it so that he can get his wedged hand free. As either task seems impossible, he hopes for someone to rescue him.....Boyle has made another stylish movie, with some very good camera-work, and has also gotten a fantastic performance from Franco.It's beautiful to watch, and the slow decline of Franco and him hitting cabin fever is quite unsettling. Even though most will know the outcome, there is still a faint sense of dread though out the film. His hallucinations are very real and even after he has done his surgery and is walking out of the canyon, you feel that he may be hallucinating and he is still there. Every time he picks something up from the rock, There is a sense of desperation, and you are praying that he doesn't drop it.This is expert film making from the Oscar winner. The much talked about surgery scene isn't really bad, and last more than a few minutes, the camera angles keeping us from the actual arm, but to the painful look on Franco.It's a good movie, very uplifting, and very psychedelic.",127 Hours
24,gradyharp,Concerto for Left Hand,10,5 March 2011,"Films such as 127 HOURS come along all too rarely. Based on a true story, the memoir by Aron Ralston 'Between a Rock and a Hard Place', and prepared for the screen by Simon Beaufoy and writer/director Danny Boyle, this film is a paean to the indomitable spirit of man. Basically a one man drama - Aron Ralston (James Franco) - the writers and director have managed to transfer enough outside of the story energy to keep the film in motion at all times. The story is well-known: Aron Ralston (Franco) set out for one of his freewheeling adventures in April 2003 in the canyons of Utah, befriends two girls (Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn) in hiking distress, and proceeds on his hike only to fall into a crevice with a heavy rock crushing his right hand. The story is about the 127 hours Ralston endures and ultimately survives by excising his own partial right extremity, thus limiting all his efforts to the use of his left hand, freeing himself until he can return home to his parents (Kate Burton and Treat Williams) and his girlfriend (Clémence Poésy). The magic in the film is how immersed Franco is in this role, keeping our attention and compassion through his on-videocamera jokes and pathos. How he survives is a wonder of nature, of ingenuity, and faith, and that is what sets the film apart as being so special. Grady Harp",127 Hours
25,trashgang,hail to James Franco and Danny Boyle,8,17 February 2011,"I don't have to introduce Danny Boyle. His flicks always had some kind of twist, just look at Trainspotting or 28 Days Later. His new much acclaimed flick ""127 hours"" already did his work in the US. Today it was premiered over here and the newspapers and tabloids did their , free promo, home work. People getting sick by watching it or just leaving the theater because they can't take it anymore. That's okay but that kind of reactions made me became precautionary. Sometimes the reactions from the US are over the top...But I can admit, if you have a weak stomach then I understand that you could become sick. I won't go into any details but there is indeed a very gory part. If you are a horror buff than you will have no problem with it but for non-horror watchers it will be a hard pill to swallow. After 15 minutes into the film Aron Ralston (excellent played by James Franco) get's stuck in the canyon. From that point on it's just him you are watching. Flashbacks, hallucinations, it all passes by. But the editing and the choice of music did his work to, when 'A Lovely Day (Bill Withers)' starts it just gave another dimension to this number. And the use of Sigur Ros, which I normally doesn't like did his work too. A must see and surely an Oscar worthy. If you liked ""Into The Wild"" then this is surely one for you.",127 Hours
26,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: 127 Hours,10,19 February 2011,"I think the reports and those who claim to have fainted when watching this is probably highly exaggerated. Sure it's graphic, but nothing not already seen in a typical torture porn film. Danny Boyle doesn't exploit this inevitable moment through lingering shots or in your face techniques, but does enough to bring forth the sheer horror and pain of the entire 127 hours ordeal that culminates with a none too pretty or neat self amputation of a limb, taking care of addressing and cutting through skin, meat, bone and tendon.Based on the memoirs of Aron Ralston's true life experience of literally being stuck between a rock and a hard place (which of course makes for a catchy book title), while I haven't read that book, Danny Boyle has weaved an incredibly fast paced picture from the get go, introducing us to Aron the weekend adventurer, who takes to the canyons for biking, climbing and exploration, played to pitch perfection by James Franco in the leading role. Quite the ladies man as well with his boyish charms and manly antics, if only to find himself never lingering at one spot, always on the go, not to allow anything to stand in his way of what could be the best weekend of his life. That is until disaster struck.When we begin from Zero hour, you can't help but feel that it's probably going to be the same with another solo, constricted space situation captured on film like Buried, which had Ryan Reynolds in a one man show buried in a box underground, and fighting for his life against his terrorist captors whom you don't see. With the camera constantly pulling to the surface of the earth just to quantify the significance of being alone and the worrying point of having nobody to contact, the narrative here doesn't get all claustrophobic on us, because Boyle made it a point for the film to be a little expansive, with various reminiscence on Aron's part, and out of body fantasy and imaginary sequences of being somewhere else other than where Aron currently is.And while that feeling of being confined is nothing new, it does make you appreciate and realize that such moments aren't far fetched, because with so many idle hours parked in between figuring out and planning how to get out, we do that idle daydream even when we're busy, so what more when we have time on our hands, with literally nowhere else to go? There's a fine balance reached where we see how Aron splits time between keeping and planning to extend his lifespan when he realizes the really deep problem he's rooted in, and that of taking time off to think about the larger picture.Which James Franco doesn't disappoint, especially when he's chronicling what could be his final hours on earth in his camcorder. He flits from being the really energetic young adult that we get introduced to, and the growingly desperate man, before basking in exuberance at the new lease of life given to him. If anyone thinks Franco is but a pretty face without substance, perhaps 127 Hours will change your mind about the actor, probably best known in his support role in Sam Raimi's Spiderman trilogy. It's almost like a one man show for about an hour of the film, so much of the weight of the film lies on Franco being able to convince us of the mixed emotions Aron goes through in different periods of the day and those hours, which he does.Danny Boyle continues to assert why he's one of the most versatile directors of today tackling a variety of genres, never running out of ideas to translate his vision in various films, always straddling between telling emotional stories that resonate even if the premise and set up screams commercial. A.R. Rahman, the Mozart of Madras continues in his second in as many collaboration with Boyle, providing original music that rocks from the start and defines the film, just like how his Chaiyya Chaiyya (though it was already used for Dil Se) did for Spike Lee's Inside Man.If there are messages to gain from the film, it is to always prepare for the unexpected, pack right and gather enough resources for the what ifs in life, and not to be a bastard in relationships, keeping an arm's length away from loved ones and/or taking them for granted. There could be a time where we find ourselves regretting for not doing some things while we can, so I guess it's up to us if we want to live life a day at a time while it's the last, or to idle it all away thinking we're invincible and infallible. Highly recommended film befitting of a nomination, but whether it could win with such illustrious company this year, will be a bit of a stretch.",127 Hours
27,namashi_1,A Milestone!,10,21 February 2011,"'127 Hours' is A Milestone Motion Picture. An Incredible True Story into a Film. Academy-Award Winner filmmaker Danny Boyle is at his best in here, he executes this story with magic. Easily amongst his finest works to date.'127 Hours' is based on real-life mountain climber Aron Ralston, who became trapped by a boulder in Robbers Roost, Utah, for more than five days in early 2003 before amputating his arm.A courageous, violent & winning true story is made into one heck of a cinematic watch. Boyle understands the story and executes each sequence like a seasoned player. Cinematography & Editing are awesome. Music by Academy-Award Winner A.R Rahman is legendary. James Franco is a marvel. A performance that isolates you and makes you question yourself. Franco has delivered an act, that will make me remember him all my life!On the whole, save for the amputation scene, this flick is an absolute must watch. Two Big Thumbs Up!",127 Hours
28,StevePulaski,It's amazing what goes through your head when you can't feel your arm.,10,12 March 2011,"127 Hours is a shockingly true story about Aron Ralston (Franco) who ventures out to the Blue John Canyon without telling anyone his whereabouts. The unthinkable happens when he falls down a canyon and his arm become pinned by a boulder. He is trapped down there for five days struggling to survive going through some desperate measures one should never have to contemplate.I've heard many say 127 is stupid, and just a boring film. They obviously have no appreciation for great scenery and a very involved soundtrack. The film is scored by Slumdog Millionaire's A.R. Rahman. Rahman is perhaps most famous from his song Jai Ho, which is a great motivating song. He scores this movie to perfection and intensity.In a way I have sympathy for Ralston, and I don't. You're not the brightest of bulbs if you go out to a canyon and bring or tell no one. I wouldn't go within a hundred feet of a canyon or mountain. I damn sure wouldn't do it alone. But Ralston begins to become delusional and hallucinate about past relationship and his family members. He realizes he never appreciated life or anything in it. He does the unthinkable and amputates his harm with a dull pocket-knife.The amputation scene was not what I expected. I expected it to be extremely gory, gruesome, and disgustingly unwatchable. It was pretty graphic, but not as graphic as I had hoped. It hardly made me cringe. Still very well done effect wise, just not as good as it's hype.James Franco deserved the Best Actor Oscar most definitely. I haven't seen The King's Speech, but Collin Firth must've truly been something to beat Franco to the Oscar. He might not be Oscar material as a host, but he sure was it as an actor.Is 127 Hours an autobiography? A documentary? A drama? Or maybe a ""docudrama."" It is an up close, in your face look at fear and hopelessness, and the closest thing you will get to that painful five days. It's almost like a documentary within a drama film. Something I've rarely seen. Further shows why Boyle's 127 Hours is a masterpiece on film.Starring: James Franco. Directed by: Danny Boyle.",127 Hours
29,blanbrn,Harrowing film. Great visuals a great reflection of life when stuck between a rock and a hard place.,8,29 January 2011,"Finally saw ""127 Hours"" and I must say terrific film a tribute to the human soul and right to life. After watching this film you will never again take anything in life for granted even the small stuff like food, water, and everything else from sharing time with people will be that much more important to you. This film is also a film of reflection to make one think about mistakes, choices, and it gives one the will and determination to live.Director Danny Boyle who's always at the top of his game always makes pictures that are tough yet usually the human soul and spirit prevails(""Slumdog Millionaire"")this picture even though harrowing and a struggle wins in the end. As it's isolated journey helps you as a viewer appreciate in the end everything about life. Many of the visuals(aside from the bloody arm amputation scene)are wonderfully done as the camera work of angles of the canyons are top notch. And themes of drama, emotion, uncertainty, loss and will to survive make it such a compelling film.Based on a real life true story of hiker and rock climber Aron Ralston(in a career best performance from Jack of all trades James Franco)it's 2003 and Aron an adventure and loner type decides to take a weekend trip to Moab, Utah for some climbing and sight seeing of some beautiful and wonderful canyons. Upon arrival he meets two cute gals Kristi(Kate Mara)and Megan(Amber Tamblyn)and after having a little fun and taking a dip in a nearby lake stream of water, it's back to more canyon climbing for Aron. Only a big fall of uncertainty and isolation takes place with a slip all of a sudden Ralston takes a fall between a narrow canyon and to complicate matters a giant boulder has fallen trapping and pinning him in.From then on the film becomes a journey of self discovery as the flashbacks and scenes of foreshadowing tell Aron a lot about life he thinks about his past and to help keep him alive and for motivation good thoughts and images of family, friends, and intimate thoughts of Kristi and Megan help keep him going another day. As being trapped for five days Aron learns to appreciate much even the small things like air and water. And perhaps god sent are the premonitions of things to come as that only gives him more motivation to live. As being stuck between a rock and a hard place and the fact that no one knows calls for desperate measures in desperate times. The scene is gross and somewhat disturbing it shows just what someone will do just so they can survive.""127 Hours"" is a film that proves never take anything for granted as in an unexpected and unplanned time of survival isolation one can learn to appreciate everything even the small things like water and air. Things happen for a reason as maybe this was for Aron to look at his life this film is a great one of reflection and having the will to live it's certainly one picture to be respected as you will feel touched and moved it's a human triumph of the soul and spirit.",127 Hours
30,lasttimeisaw,127 Hours,8,2 March 2011,"From the first frame, the breathtaking beauty of the cinematography subjugated me since Danny Boyle's consistent visual concussion maintained at a high standard. I am not a rhapsodic traveler at all, still I was moved by the film and by the protagonist Aron Ralston.The film deals with a quite essential proposition that when we encounter our incubus expectedly (for Aron, it was the stone, and for numerous others, it could be anything which may serve us as a hindrance), how to gather the courage, then exert reduction to practice to vanquish it eventually; the whole process is a personal sublimation for each individual as well. The one-actor setting offers James Franco a chance once in a blue moon that he could take it as his career's magnum opus. Thankfully he lives up to our expectation and delivers a energetic and vivid performance which should be concluded as powerful and splendid! I put him as my No.2 BEST ACTOR 2010 (after Jesse Eisenberg) by far. Now 2011 Oscar has just finished, Franco's sluggish state does suggest that it is a wise decision that he should never meddle with emcee anymore. I think the bloody nerve-cutting scene does persuade some potential audience from watching it, which I consider is a big loss, if one could endure the raw physiological torture (literally it only lasts several seconds at most), you will find it is worthwhile. The flashbacks & illusions after the accident happened were well-crafted, diluted the humdrum of the crack setting and enriched the character too. It is an amazing payoff as the storyline is way too thin (compared with SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE) to be scripted into a feature length film. After the overwhelming success of SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE (2008), Boyle's follow-up inherits his skillful interpretation and devotes an encouraging film which once again shows his surefooted talent to make wonders.",127 Hours

Well Danny Boyle can, this was a really engaging and captivating movie and most although most audiences will know the outcome. You still really care about the character and all the hardship he had to go through. James Franco did a phenomenal job playing Aron Ralston and made his character really likable. This film is shot so well that I actually felt like I was there with Aron Ralston, except I am just the audience so I can't do anything to help which made the experience more tense and painful to watch. Not because it's a bad movie, far from it but because of how realistic and captivating everything is. From the build up to almost everything else is done very well and will leave a impact when it's finished.8/10",127 Hours
33,sddavis63,A Powerful One Man Performance From James Franco,8,27 January 2011,"Clearly, James Franco's performance as Aron Ralston is the highlight of this movie. Franco is basically putting on a one-man show for probably 90% of the running time and he (and director Danny Boyle) manage to keep the story flowing effortlessly, and draw the viewer into the nightmare that Ralston has literally fallen into. Ralston is a rock climber who makes the tragic mistake of going climbing alone without telling anyone where he would be going. A fall into a deep crevice traps his arm against a canyon wall and the movie is the account of Ralston's fight to survive, based on the book that he wrote about this experience. In that sense, there's no real mystery about what the outcome will be - the movie is based on Ralston's own book, and acknowledges that off the top. Obviously he survives. The question is how. Franco brilliantly portrays Ralston's growing desperation (which begins more as frustration as he assumes that he'll find a way out but gradually realizes that getting out is going to be a lot more difficult than he at first thought.) As his food and water run out and as he battles insects and cold nights and comes to terms with his life and some of the mistakes he's made you get drawn into his situation. Even if you've never read the book, you basically know how this situation is going to be resolved but that doesn't take away from the movie's power. In some respects I might compare this to the movies ""Alive"" or ""World Trade Centre"" - each of which deal with somewhat similar circumstances of people trapped in nightmarish situations wondering how they're going to get out. The difference here is the one-man nature of the story.In addition to Franco's performance, the on location filming offers starkly beautiful pictures of the canyon environment. From a strictly personal perspective (and this is merely a matter of taste I suppose) I didn't care for much of the musical score (especially the opening music) and I'm not really a big fan of split screens, which occur periodically throughout this. Overall, though, from the simple perspective of the story (which is, of course, what really counts) I'd say this is a must see.",127 Hours
34,Hellmant,Between Life and Death!,9,8 December 2010,"'127 HOURS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Yet another remarkably bold achievement in seemingly impossible cinematic storytelling this year! Like 'BURIED' from earlier this year this film tells the story of one man trapped in a single confined location for the duration of almost the entire film. Unlike 'BURIED' this film sets up the scenario and also leaves the primary location in flashbacks and day dreams. It also utilizes a lot of flashy special effects and stylized visuals to drive it's message home. It's still an astonishingly creative and one of a kind film going experience. It's impressively directed by Danny Boyle (in his long awaited follow-up to the Academy Award winning 'SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE') and features one of the best performances of the year (right alongside Ryan Reynolds in 'BURIED' in my opinion) from early Oscar front-runner James Franco.The film is written by Boyle and his 'SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE' scriptwriter Simon Beaufoy. It's based on an autobiographical book by Aron Ralston (entitled ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place""). The book tells of Ralston's world famous mountain climbing adventure where he became trapped by a collapsed boulder, which pinned his arm, while climbing alone in an isolated canyon in Utah in 2003. Ralston was trapped for over 5 days and finally grew up enough courage to resort to desperate measures in order to free himself and survive. Franco gives probably his finest performance to date playing the man as he struggles with survival, losing his sanity and facing his biggest regrets in life. The real Aron Ralston kept a video diary while he was stuck, as depicted in the film (using the same exact camera). He had only allowed his family and friends to view the video until he let Boyle and Franco see the footage in order to more accurately depict true events. It's been quoted that Ralston is quite happy with and moved by the film.The film is of course very moving and inspirational (at times even tear jerking) but this is something that any competent filmmaker should have been able to deliver given the material and resources. How Boyle tells the story is what's truly remarkable and memorable about the film as well as his ability to stretch the material into a highly involving and entertaining adventure for a full 93 minutes (credit also has to be given to his co-scriptwriter for that though). The movie is very claustrophobic, surreal and horrifying. The climax is excruciatingly hard to watch and more grotesque than almost any horror film (there have been reports of viewers suffering from shock and needing medical assistance at multiple screenings). James Franco is one of those actors that I never thought had much talent early on given a lot of the choices in film roles he'd take but it appears as though he just made a lot of unwise career decisions (I always thought he was the weakest link in the 'SPIDER-MAN' films). In recent years he's proved himself to be one of the most talented and diverse young actors working today. 'PINEAPPLE EXPRESS' was his initial role that really caught my attention (but I also hadn't seen his earlier memorable work on 'FREAKS AND GEEKS' until after that). This is his finest performance to date and one of the best single performances of the year and the movie is one of the most impressive creative achievements of the year as well.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JQ4A-I9-JM",127 Hours
35,Buddy-51,When being caught between a rock and a hard place becomes all too real,8,3 May 2011,"Few movies provide as purely visceral an experience as ""127 Hours,"" a gripping true-life account of a man who literally gives his right arm to save his life.It was April 2003 when daredevil outdoorsman and experienced rock climber Aron Walston ventured alone into Blue John Canyon in Utah without telling anybody where he was going. Tragedy struck when a giant boulder came crashing down on him, smashing and pinning his right arm so that Walston was actually left dangling a few feet above the ground. After more than five days in this position, he made the horrific decision to cut off the arm, thereby free himself from his predicament.Given the shockingly gruesome nature of the material, it's possible that many people avoided watching this movie when it played in theaters. One of the advantages of seeing the movie on DVD is that the faint of heart can fast-forward through the more unsettling parts and not miss out on the overall experience – or James Franco's dazzling and empathic tour-de-force performance.Moments of lucidity alternate with moments of intense unreality and confusion as the hours tick off and Walston increasingly struggles against hunger, thirst, cold, pain and mounting desperation. What strikes one most about Walston is the amazing resourcefulness and calm demeanor he demonstrates while confronting a situation most of us can imagine only in our worst nightmares. Walston certainly has time to think back over his life and to consider what exactly brought him to this moment in time and to contemplate the people who've made the deepest impact on him, and how he's treated - and, in some cases, mistreated - them throughout the course of his life.Walston's ordeal resonates with viewers in that it shows us just how vulnerable we are to the cruel exigencies of an indifferent Nature, and how one little mistake or simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time can forever seal our fate.Director Danny Boyle and co-writer Simon Beaufry keep things from becoming unduly claustrophobic by throwing hallucinations, memories and imaginings into the narrative mix and by freely indulging in the hyperkinetic montage sequences that have long been the hallmark of Boyle's style (see ""Trainspotting"" and ""Slumdog Millionaire"").In terms of acting, this is pretty much a one-man show, but there are important contributions from Amber Tamblyn, Kate Mara and Treat Williams in small but significant roles.Hard as it may be to sit through at times, ""127 Hours"" provides us with an unforgettable and ultimately inspiring portrait of a man staring into the face of Death – and making Death blink.",127 Hours
36,thesar-2,Thank God it Wasn't Even 127 Minutes,8,30 January 2011,"Director Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire, 28 Days Later, Trainspotting) is an established and brilliant film-maker and knows this very-hard subject matter did, in fact, needed to be a short film – 94 minutes.What this guy, Aron Ralston (played beautifully by James Franco in, by far, his best performance) had to go through for just over five days (go ahead: divide 127 hours by 24) was just torture and I'm just talking about the much-talked about exit strategy. Mercifully, since we really know what's to come before our butt hits the comfortable seat – I'm sure he'd give his right arm to sit down during those 5 days – ouch, sorry – its good we don't have to endure much more than an hour and a half.That's not to take away from his pain. But, quite literally, the events that took place, the background and surroundings, didn't really need much more time. Boyle did just fine with what took place.Simply speaking, avid and arrogant outdoorsman Aron treks alone in the Utah canyons after meeting two out-of-nowhere pretty girls. They invite him to a Scooby of a party that night after he shows them a ""wet"" time. I'm guessing this might have inflated his ego even more, if possible, and he takes an ill-fated risk causing a bolder to lodge between a canyon wall and his poor right arm.Unfortunately for him, no one's within shouting distance and all first attempts at freeing himself are futile. What follows (for what we know are hours, then days) are his textbook emotions – SEE: Open Water. And that's not discounting what he went through, nor is it saying any of its fake on what occurred during his imprisonment. For, unlike The Perfect Storm, Aron video tapes himself down there.Yeah, it's a true story, and I concur he's more of an survivalist than me, but I'd give up one whole paycheck for the batteries he was buyingnothing I own would last as long as his did on battery juice.I digress. Again, Franco did a fantastic job – pretty much, aside from (potential hallucinations) or flashbacks, he's running the one-man show.Comparatively speaking, the same year produced Buried, another one-man extravaganza about a man trapped in a coffin. Between the two, putting the ""trueness"" of this one aside, I'd pick 127 Hours even without the gruesome ending and self-mutilation he had to endure/cause.Aside from the great cinematography, the quick length and the performance worthy of an Oscar Nod (only) I will say I admire Boyle not turning this into a ""Hero"" type of feel-good movie. The man, Aron, did nothing heroic, he put himself selfishly and incautiously in harm's way and he did what needed to be done to get free. He didn't jump on a speeding train (Unstoppable) to save the children! Or trek to NYC (The Day After Tomorrow) to save freezing children! Or, you get the picture. He fell making a mistake after making a mistake of not telling anyone where he was at. So, he made mistakes, paid dearly and now we get an instructional video of what not to do.The movie's nominated for best picture. Sure, it was good, very well made, even though I did NOT care for the music choices very much. Should it win? Absolutely not. Should it be viewed: hell yes.",127 Hours
37,Robert_duder,Marred by 'uniqueness' that is almost a little too odd for the type of film that it is,7,17 August 2011,"You couldn't turn the channel without hearing something about 127 Hours and the story behind it when it first came out. The story was captivating and I thought a film that bordered on a disaster movie, a survival film, a man overcoming the worst of odds and cheating death would be incredible and if anyone could pull a roll off like that it would be James Franco. But I digress for a moment. I finally got in to see the film and I think I felt just a little bit disappointed. The film is not bad by any means. His survival story is fantastic. I think by the time I saw the film the hype was so big around it that I could only be slightly disappointed by it. I actually blame my disappointment squarely on the shoulders of the director. I felt like his overblown ego which we have seen before especially following the run away success that I never understood of another critically hyped film of his Slumdog Millionaire, was in full swing. He had to make his own unique flare to the story and it ended up being like a music video, choppy and obscure and I do understand that the film's pace and style is a reflection of the main characters sanity but I think it went just a little too far.James Franco is probably one of the hardest working, most versatile guys in the movie business. He's a leading man, he's a supporting actor, he does TV, film and anything he can get his hands on. He clearly loves his craft. He is the perfect fit for the role of Aron Ralston. He has this down to earth, guy next door quality that endears him to you and then to see him in that horrifying situation essentially losing his mind is heart breaking and nerve wracking and that is great for the film. This is very nearly a one man show. I suppose that is part of the reason they added the significant beginning to the film where Ralston meets two women hiking and befriends them. Amber Tamblyn and Kate Mara play those women. I can't really say a lot about their performance as it is a very small role and they fulfil the part nicely. Tamblyn is a welcome face also from TV and film. The other reason for the rather extensive opening scene of him befriending the women is that we can get to know Ralston better outside of his horrifying situation so we can see just how nice and down to earth this guy is.This might sound morbid and maybe I need to watch the film again but the whole build up for this film is to where Ralston ultimately cuts off his own arm with a pocket knife to escape certain death. When they finally got to that scene I felt like it was a bit of a let down compared to the build up. I mean its still intense but the journey is what makes it intense not the outcome. Of course no one has seen Ralston's real video footage except for Ralston, his family, director and co-writer Danny Boyle and James Franco apparently. Maybe I'm wrong about the directing style seeming flippant and jumpy, maybe that is the true story. I do believe Boyle tried very hard to capture Ralston as close to true life as possible. 127 Hours is a gripping drama at times but I think I became a victim over over hyped word of mouth on this one. While I found it interesting at times, I also found it to be a little over-intensified and less entertaining. Check it out for yourself and see another amazing James Franco performance. 7/10",127 Hours
38,ElMaruecan82,"Painful and thrilling experience, meaningful and inspiring story ...",10,26 February 2011,"Danny Boyle's multi-layered ""127 Hours"" works on the three levels that make a film great in my opinion: spiritual, physical and emotional. It's a riveting experience, elevating to the extreme the notions of determination and resistance. It's a thriller, a character study, and a powerful story of courage and perseverance, even more inspiring because it's true.Despite its fairly short length, the film feels longer than that, and this is one of its main strengths. Danny Boyle's scrupulous directing creates an exhausting empathy towards Aron Ralston, the protagonist, portrayed by James Franco, in what I consider the best male performance of 2010. Empathy to the extreme as you feel like your own arm is trapped under that boulder. Free enough to move your body, having a deceptive impression of freedom, but still trapped. And when the boulder crashes on Aron's arm, his mind is clear despite the pain and so is his spirit. His self-preservation encourages him to move the boulder and never the amputation comes to his mind as an option. And, we can't imagine this cool and good looking guy will condemn himself to such a handicap. But this is because the point is still not survival. Just give him some time  and time is all we have. ""127 Hours"" is like a prison movie with a rock as a prison cell and a Utah canyon as a jail, in the middle of nowhere. And Aron Ralston, the loner, the young free spirited climber as the prisoner, condemned to 127 hours of painful endurance, both moral and physical.I said ""loner"" but in fact, Aron is not alone, there's one second major character in this movie, inanimate but significant: the handy cam. The handy cam adds to the realism of the story, it's like the real cam of the film, not James Franco playing Aron Ralston, but Aron Ralston filming himself. Secondly, the cam is a way to convey a message that might as well be posthumous, it's his testimony. And last but not least, it plays the same role as Wilson the volleyball as the last sacred link with the rest of the world. It makes him talk, see himself like in a mirror, feeling he exists. The cam works even when it doesn't, and this is one of the most clever points of the films. We all have this strange confused feeling that we're being watched, and I don't mean paranoia. I mean when you feel you're a part of a film with an audience, you ask yourself ""what if I was watched?"" and try to act as normally as possible. The movie intelligently illustrated that feeling which, as ludicrous as it may sound, is important because preventing you from insanity by trying to maintain your reason and common sense. When Aron was hallucinating, or starting to flirt with some early steps of insanity, all his memories came to life. When he was about to please his sexual organ while watching the image of a woman's breasts, he automatically restrained himself, maintaining a form of dignity as if his family or friends were really watching.Never losing it  this is Aron's physical and spiritual struggle, if his mind cracks up, if he breaks down under the pressure, his body is lost. And the body must be preserved, through an efficient symbiosis, to keep the spirit sane. Aron must drink even if it's pee while fantasizing about a fresh orange juice. And this is the point of the editing, one of the film other strengths : ""127 Hours"" is punctuated with entertaining montages featuring what happens inside Aron's body, when he drinks, the bubbles are like a refreshing injection of life in a suffering body, so when the water is going low  we experience the dryness in our throats. These montages work as incredible exercises of contrasts, insisting on the location, through an extraordinary cinematography that eliminates any chance of being saved by other people. Indeed, as it goes on, as we see Aron's face getting paler and thinner, while the ""others"" are probably having fresh beers, fun and sex. We get deeper in the concept of loneliness, Aron got on this .... alone, and alone, he'll go through it.And this last point leads to one hell of a disturbing climax I won't even try to describe how graphic it is. But as shocked as I was, I couldn't help but cheer for the blood splattering, the bone snapping, every grunt, every shout, every tear, every move, because each one was like a victory against the adversity of an undeserved punishment. And this is why the movie is not just thrilling and entertaining, it's inspiring on a deeper level because it made me think that if I was in this case, I would have probably considered that removing this very arm that helps me to write these words, as a victory. This movie not only works in an emotional and physical level, engaging all your senses, it's also one of the most endearingly spiritual achievements of these last years. It's a redemption story of a character, guilty of a free-spirited nature that detached him from sacred bonds like Family, friends  Aron's deliberate carelessness was his flaw, the one that made a simple ""oops"" omission : not telling where he was going, a fatal mistake, turning the prophecy of his ex-girlfriend :""You're gonna get so lonely"" into a reality. This experience was Aron's redemption.""127 Hours"" is about destiny, as I said sometimes we feel like we're watched, like living a film written by God where every fate is like a life-changing plot device. In Aron's case, reality exceeded the fiction, and Danny Boyle managed to create a powerful story about a new inspiring cinematic hero who tasted one of the most painful meanings of the word ""lonely"", the 127 hours in hell was his lesson, and our inspiration.",127 Hours
39,paul2001sw-1,Rock around the clock,8,25 January 2012,"'Touching the Void' and 'Between a Rock and a Hard Place' are two of the great stories of wilderness adventures gone wrong. But whereas the former was always going to make a great film, the latter (the inspiration for '127 hours') is more problematic, because of the static nature of the tale (basically, a man gets trapped beneath a rock). However, the Utah scenery is gorgeous, James Franco is note perfect as the initially rather arrogant young man who has the courage not to die, and director Danny Boyle, whose films I don't always admire, makes a good fist at finding cinematic ways to chart his protagonist's increasingly desperate state of mind. Almost inevitably, though, as a film about being stuck, it drags a little, before it's amazing, horrific yet wonderful end.",127 Hours
40,g-bodyl,Cinematic Gold!,10,8 January 2013,"127 Hours is a little film that I would call cinematic gold. This is a gut-wrenching film that requires very little actors and great directing. Danny Boyle's film is another film that shows why 2010 was one of the greatest year for films ever. 127 Hours will definitely play with emotions effectively. I was feeling the pain that the character felt even though it was only psychological pain.This film is based on the true story of Aron Raltson and how his hand became trapped under a large boulder. With no help in sight, it's up to Aron to do all he can to survive and get himself free.James Franco gives one of the best performances of 2010. His portrayal as the confident, know-it-all Aron was emotional and heart-wrenching.Overall, this is a powerful film that is a great example of telling a story about humans doing what they can to survive. There are some graphic scenes here that are relevant to the story and gut-wrenching as well. This is a well-made film and one of Danny Boyle's best rivaling only Slumdog Millionaire. I rate this film 10/10.",127 Hours

For the 2 or 3 of you who don't know how it ends I won't ruin it, but this movie really explores the human condition and shows what we can overcome if we really want to. This is a movie like ""Castaway"" and ""Buried"" as it involves basically one person the entire movie. The movie keeps you entertained the entire time, and it is a very tense situation. There are large chunks of the movie that have no dialog, but unless you realize there is no talking you don't really notice it. Franco does a great job with this part and is very enjoyable to watch. Very worthy of a best picture nomination. This is not a movie to just put in and watch, this is one you have to prepare for, the ending is very intense.

46,ironhorse_iv,Give James Franco and 127 Hours a hand! They did a great job!,8,25 April 2013,"One thing that Director Danny Boyle got right in this film is how close they film the movie based on Aron Ralston's memoir Between a Rock and a Hard Place. The film stars James Franco as real-life adventurer Aron Ralston, who became trapped by a fallen boulder that crashed on his arm and trapped him in an isolated canyon in Blue John Canyon, Utah. The cinematography of the desert was beautiful shot. I like how Boyle convey the vastness of the canyon and the area of Aron get entombed. I was kinda one of the people that didn't really watched to see this, but after seeing the reviews. I went to see this on my own. I was pretty blown away. I kinda like James Franco in this movie, he was very charming in this movie, unlike his roles in Spiderman. It's probably his best role since Pineapple Express. It was a great start, by 20 minutes in the film, besides meeting the girls Kristi (Kate Mara) and Megan (Amber Tambyln). You pretty much just have James Franco stuck on a rock. Most of the scenes Aron shares with them is pretty much pointless. In my opinion, you can pretty much skip 20 minutes until he get his hand stuck and you wouldn't miss much. So James Franco's Aron Ralston had to be a likable character in this for it to work. The one thing, I found funny is how loose that rock look. He pretty much, did a dumbass move, by getting stuck like that in my opinion. Anyways, days pass, and you see flashbacks from his life. The good thing about this movie is that he didn't really had a bad life, unlike most of the movie's survivor characters I watch. The film introduces us to Aron's father (Treat Williams) and mother (Kate Burton) and the love of his life, Rana (Clemence Poesy) through brief flashback. These moments, though brief, helps to give us insight into Aron's character and life. At times it was hard to know what the flashbacks were referring to. I recommend reading the book or getting the book on tape to get a great account if the story first, before watching this. His mind is running, while he is not. It was just him, trying to get away from the pain of being trapped. He gets crazy, and acts funny at times without moving. I love the idea of him trying to keep sane, by acting like he has a TV Show at the abandoned canyon. I like how strong and smart, he can be, despite being a bit of an idiot. There is no force more powerful than the will to live. I love the Gatorade scene as well. I never though Scooby Doo can be use so creepy. The dream sequences are very haunting and well done. Without spoiling the ending, there is a scene where Aron must act upon to save himself. That scene is both realistic and gruesome, even more when one takes into account that this actually occurred. Rarely does a scene make me wince and recoil the way this scene did. It's brilliantly shot, edited, and executed; graphic, but Boyle only shows as much as necessary relying on haunting sound effects and Franco to convey what's happening. It's a powerful, unforgettable scene. It's a bit predictable, if you saw the trailers for the film or hear the movie. Most people know what happens to Aron Ralston, there. It can be a bit long, and drawn out. It would probably work better as a good documentary with scenes of Aron's family talking about him with the movie style reenactment. Still, I like the movie to have more description of Aron's efforts trying to get out of the desert. Overall, I like the movie. It's an inspiring tale of the strength of the human spirit. So check it out, and see how one man cheated death.",127 Hours
47,briancham1994,Does a good job with its premise,7,4 June 2020,"This film is based on a real life story that can effectively be encapsulated in one sentence, so it had a challenge from the outset.

48,Rodrigo_Amaro,A thrilling and real story about a man against himself,10,14 March 2011,"When you go to see Danny Boyle's ""127 Hours"" you simply have two choices just like the main character trapped in the canyon: or you watch it or leave it behind without seeing a thing. But if you want to see be aware of everything that comes on the story of Aron Ralston and don't expect to find a howling message than the ones given by the main character in some scenes. It's indeed a real story but it doesn't fills us with morals, messages or anything similar which is very common in real life stories. Perhaps the biggest lessons you can learn with ""127 Hours"" is always bring a cellphone wherever you'll go, and always, always, tell to everyone you know where are you going, just in the case you get lost in the middle of the desert, with your arm trapped in a canyon, without water to drink and other disasters. This is a movie about what happened to Aron (played by James Franco) and all his ways of survival during those five days with his arm stuck in a canyon in the desert without a phone, not able to call for any help and with his water stock running out, and with only had two choices while being there: death a slowly death or cut off his arm with a knife. Second option is the chosen one and is the most awaited moment in the film. The amputation scene (filmed in one take) is frightening with some good sound effects mixed with the background music. Everything is thrilling here, from the minute where Aron's adventure begins up until his tough and difficult moments in the canyon, thinking about his family and some imaginary moments of a future life outside of the canyon, and his moments after getting out of there. This is a one man show and Franco carries the whole film in a heartbreaking performance. A movie depending on his main star is very difficult to be made and to audiences like (being Tom Hanks in ""Cast Away"" a rare successful example) but Boyle surely found his actor here. Franco is excellent in the whole drama, he's very believable in the risky scenes climbing the canyons, you really can believe that he's a adventurer (although a little bit silly). But if the dramatic scenes, and his breakdown moments are great and conduces the film, it is a funny and surprising moment that really caught my attention, and that is the ""Good Morning"" scene, a hilarious and positive moment where Aron makes fun of himself while in the canyon, creating a TV show where he interviews himself telling his whole situation there. Just a reminder of how positive someone could be even in a dramatic and tense situation, not everyone can do that, and he managed to lighten up the tension of a story that at no point makes us feel distracted, calm, or uninterested. It holds the viewers in the chair at every second, every minute in its short running time.""127 Hours"" doesn't want to deliver a message, or be preachy about anything, it's not philosophical. It is simply a real life event that urges the viewers to see the man's struggle in a shocking event where he only has two choices and both of them are not that good and he's the only one who can do something about it. There's a few lessons to be learned here even for those who are not inclined to enter in an adventure in the middle of the desert.Danny Boyle makes of ""127 Hours"" a triumph in technical qualities, great editing, great music, great sound effects, brilliant cinematography and a powerful performance by James Franco. The final result is a great film about a man against himself in his most difficult and most painful moment of his life. 10/10",127 Hours
49,tomgillespie2002,Solid survival film,7,13 February 2011,"It was a wonder what direction Danny Boyle would take after the phenomenal success, both critically and commercially, of 2008's Slumdog Millionaire. He has always been a independent director, and even when taking on larger projects such as Sunshine and The Beach, he has always maintained that low-budget feel. I always look forward to anything Boyle does, and even though I have an almost resentful attitude toward Slumdog due to it's overrated success, I was pleased to hear that he had decided to stick to what he does best and make relatively low-key film that is practically a one-man show. It is also nice that 127 Hours is one of his best.In 2003, reckless thrill-seeker Aron Ralston went rock-climbing and hiking in the canyons of Utah without telling anyone where he was. He meets a couple of female hikers who he takes to a hidden pool and has a bit of fun with before departing to wander the plains on his own. In a bizarre accident, Ralston slips on a loose boulder and falls into a canyon, the boulder falling with him and landing on his arm, completely trapping him. It takes some time for the gravity of the situation to hit Ralston after some initial confusion. He must work out how to escape his predicament or accept his fate, with only a few tools including a blunt pen knife, and very little water for company. It will be of no surprise to know that Aron Ralston does survive the ordeal, and famously had to cut off his own arm with said pen knife in order to escape. The skill of Boyle as a director, and the acting ability of James Franco as our hero, combine to make the film as exciting and nail-biting as a story can be when we already know the outcome.It must have been an ordeal to figure out how to make a 90-minute film about one man stuck in one place for over five days. Kudos goes to editor Jon Harris and cinematographers Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle for using all the tricks in the book to make the visuals consistently interesting and never allowing the action to drag. As Ralston begins to hallucinate as his water rationing begins to take it's toll, a combination of split-screens, distorted colours and inserts from pop culture allow us to be placed into the character's damaged state. The camera-work and editing is fast and flashy, much like the character of Aron Ralston himself - always living fast, sometimes too fast for his own good. It's obvious that Danny Boyle is in a deft hand when directing his films this way. It's evident in the fantastic Trainspotting, as Ewan McGregor's Renton goes cold turkey on his heroin addiction, and in the first hour of Slumdog, as he depicts the madness and colour of the slums. It would be difficult to see imagine another director taking on such as challenge with so much confidence and flair.Which moves us to James Franco's Oscar-nominated lead performance. If this film is a reliable source, and due to the fact it has received Ralston's stamp of authenticity I imagine it is, Aron Ralston is a complete nob head, and is exactly the type of person I would avoid in real life. He is careless, arrogant and cocky, and is only interested in fulfilling his own desires. Franco manages to convince of this totally, and yet I found myself rooting for him as his situation worsens. It's a staggering performance, and from the other I've seen in the Best Actor category (Jeff Bridges and Jesse Eisenberg), he is my favourite. It's a performance of maturity, and in some scenes he is reminiscent of a young Robert De Niro. It's not mean feat to carry a 90 minute film almost completely by yourself, and it hasn't been done so well since Tom Hanks did it in the underrated Cast Away. The scene in which Ralston stages a pretend game-show into his video camera with himself as both host and guest, Franco delivers both shame and over-the-top insanity as Ralston reflects on his attitudes and his recklessness. It's a fantastic scene for Franco, and deserves to win him the Oscar alone.Not to say that their aren't problems with the film. Towards the end it begins to get unnecessarily sentimental as Ralston starts to think of his family, who he has constantly neglected, watching over him. And when the 'long-awaited' arm removal scene comes, I didn't know what to make of it. Boyle uses sound effects and quick editing which renders the scene easier to watch, and I wasn't sure whether to see this as a cop- out or not. I felt that it is something Ralston went through and it would only be right to show it how it happened, but on the other hand it is more tastefully done. It could have been exploitative in the hands of a poorer director, and I suppose it heightens the absurdity of his circumstance. Given the height of disillusionment and dehydration he was in at the time, he probably didn't experience it in a regular way anyway.A solid survival flick, and a refreshingly stylish take on it. It deserves to be seen for Franco's performance alone, who I assume will prosper from this to become a highly-sought after leading man.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",127 Hours

51,filipemanuelneto,A great survival story,6,29 September 2015,"This film, with direction and script by Danny Boyle, tells the story of Aron Ralston, an adventurer who gets trapped in a canyon after a heavy rock crushing his hand. Based on real facts, written by true Ralston in his book ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"", this film deals with the theme of survival and loneliness, trying to show how far can a man go when he's alone and needs to survive. Featuring James Franco as protagonist.Its an intense film, where the audience is clinging to several attempts that the character does to get rid of the situation, potentially fatal, which inadvertently ended. However, the absence of a larger plot (only broken by mental flashbacks that show us the character's thoughts) ends up making this movie too stopped, and it would be a bit boring if not for the extraordinary soundtrack and the sense of danger that surrounds all action, since the moment Ralston falls into the gully. The interpretation of Franco is very good: the actor managed to give his character the psychological aspect of a man in utter despair. For all this, the film was nominated for six Oscars (Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score and Best Original Song for the song ""If I Rise"") and three Golden Globes (Best Dramatic Actor, Best Film Screenplay and Best Original Score).",127 Hours
52,howard.schumann,Frenetic pace and jazzed up music-video style,8,28 November 2010,"127 Hours is a dramatization of outdoorsman Aron Ralston's desperate attempt to survive a fall into the bottom of an isolated canyon that pinned his right hand under a huge rock. The film is directed by Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire) and written by Simon Beaufroy who based the screenplay on Aron Ralston's memoir, ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place."" From the opening scene we know we are in for a wild ride. Boyle has the audience immediately climbing the walls with pounding music and rapid fire sequences shown on split screens that display crowds cheering, people running, and a frenzy of movement, perhaps in an attempt to show the random chaos of Ralston's existence.Soon we see Ralston, an experienced hiker, speeding along on his dirt bike in Utah's Blue John Canyon in Canyonlands National Park as he undertakes in his own words, ""a capriciously impromptu vacation."" In bravura style, he doesn't tell anyone where he is going and is only equipped with a pocket knife, a bottle of water, a video recorder, some candy bars, a camera and a backpack. Presumably cell phones weren't invented at the time. Using cinematographers Anthony Dod Mantle and Enrique Chediak, the beauty of the canyon has never been as vividly displayed. When Aron meets two lost female hikers (Amber Tamblyn and Kate Mara), he guides them to a swimming hole shimmering in the sun where all jump in with an explosive sound and a joyous release that's palpably felt.After inviting Aron to a party on the weekend, the two hikers leave with one of them remarking that ""I don't think we figured in his day at all,"" Impatient to move on, tragedy strikes suddenly when his bike crashes into the rocks. Gripping a huge boulder to maintain his stability, he loses his balance and falls to the bottom of the canyon, his right hand pinned underneath the giant stone. Trapped and unable to move his hand, his repeated cry, ""I need help,"" signals not only his plea to be rescued but his realization about how alone he is in the world. Ralston has little water which is rapidly running out and only a small amount of food and he knows that he could die in a few days.Though we never enter any sort of dreamlike state as in Requiem for a Dream, Aron visualizes images of his life shown in super-hyped cutaways and flashbacks that recall an ex girlfriend (Clémence Poésy) that he perhaps broke up with too suddenly, a picture of his sister on her wedding day, and a vision of the future in which he sees a little boy and an unknown woman snuggling close to him. Ralston spends much of his time recording his thoughts into his camcorder (the real Ralston did the same), often playfully assuming different roles.He does becomes serious, however, when he tells his mother that he's sorry he missed her last phone call and that he loves her. As each new day dawns and Ralston is at the end of his rope both literally and figuratively, he begins to realize that the only way out is to take the ultimate drastic step that you may have heard about, an act shown in a brutally extended sequence that lasts four minutes and had most viewers, including this one, hiding their eyes.Franco does an impressive job in presenting Ralston as an energetic but immature individual who enjoys travelling solo, yet we learn little about the kind of person he is, and I often felt as if I was watching a performance rather than being emotionally involved with a life or death struggle. In his desire to keep us in a good mood, Boyle ratchets up the entertainment with a jazzed up, music video style that drains the impact of the unfolding drama. Though we sense that, as a result of his ordeal, Ralston will experience a renewed connection with others, we never really learn if he fully understands deep down that his aloofness may have created the problems in his life, or if his spiritual outlook has deepened. Sabotaged by Boyle's frenetic pace, 127 Hours eliminates any contemplation of the eternal silences.",127 Hours
53,TheMovieDiorama,127 Hours swiftly counts down every enduring hour to its grotesquely effective amputation.,7,7 May 2020,"Canyonlands National Park, Utah. Smooth slot canyons, intricately weaving through the desolate landscape, bask in the beating sunlight. Its burning rays illuminating the curvaceous formations that guide hikers to their idyllic destination. Aron Ralston, an adventurous mountaineer, one day journeys across the park. Befriending fellow backpackers, presenting them with natural wonders kept hidden from sight. Underground pools harnessing crystal clear water, just a leap of faith away. After a joyous separation, he lonesomely traverses Bluejohn Canyon. Hurtling over deceased wood and precarious boulders. He slips. A loosened large boulder follows his trajectory. Falling from gracious heights, Aron's right hand becomes wedged in 'Between a Rock and a Hard Place'. He cries for urgent assistance. But only his echoes reply. With limited supplies, time was running out. Aron, confronted with destiny, must overcome his own mentality to succumb to the inevitable action that would free his temporary imprisonment.Boyle's adaptation of Ralston's biographical memoir, initially, resembled the standardisation of trapped thrillers. One individual with a select amount of tools at their disposal must escape from the claustrophobic location that is holding them custody. An engrossing central performance, undoubtedly Franco's best dramatic endeavour thus far, allows the particular central character to experience an array of emotions from determination to desperation, before developing a moral compass that had since been disregarded. These enclosed survival thrillers have been executed before. However, what enables 127 Hours to stand above the competition and garner several Academy Award nominations in the process, is Boyle's direction. It's a pure example of exuberance elevating a simplistic yet solidly constructed personable ordeal. He is able to embed an urban aesthetic, despite the rural environment, that increases the core frenetic energy throughout.Aron gulping on the slowly diminishing water supply is made increasingly apparent by employing a camera within the bottle itself. Aron chipping away parts of the boulder with an inexpensive multi-tool or him pushing the obstacle with his entire body force, are made inclusively exhausting through camera actions that jolt forward with each momentous push. The gorgeous aerial footage capturing the endless horizons of the National Park, securing his unfortunate solidarity. Harris' signature editing stylistics, notably the split screen time lapses of fast-moving society, illustrating Ralston's putrefying mentality whilst maintaining Boyle's metropolitan buoyancy. All culminating in a visceral scene that invades every sense available. The inevitable amputation that audiences were fainting over, even before the film was theatrically released. It's an impeccable reaction, not due to the biographical nature of 127 Hours, but the invasive filming style. The piercing sound effects when Ralston slashes a tendon and the abrupt camera rotation when he initially breaks the arm. Perfect examples of employing realistic imagination without displaying the act's gratuitous gore in its entirety. Such directorial flair that, not only visually engages, but narratively powers through the sparse screenplay.127 Hours is unsurprisingly only eight-nine minutes in length. The first ten minutes introduces Ralston through a dutch angled bike ride across the park (Darude's 'Sandstorm' anyone?) before presenting the main claustrophobic event. The initial problem with this, is that the emotional connectivity with the central character takes precious time to develop. Time that unfortunately this feature does not have the luxury of expending. It's not until the third act when you start cheering for his survival, and that's an issue. Flashbacks and premonitions are embedded throughout to grant some much needed characterised background, however the harrowing ordeal of his physical pain overwhelms the tender interior experiences. Had there been additional introductory development, these succinct moments would've been substantially more effective. Franco also occasionally seemed somewhat unrealistically calm in several situations, in particular the day transitions when Withers' 'Lovely Day' would ironically play, which lacked an authentic continuity.Still, Boyle will always remain as a leading director in visual storytelling. With that, 127 Hours may just be his most personable and audacious feature yet. As a depiction of brute survival, enlisting the tactics of claustrophobic film-making, it's a resounding success that will leave viewers wanting a solid 127 hour runtime. The personal touches however required more development in order to make Ralston a hugely relatable individual. We can all agree on one lesson though. Never go mountaineering by yourself, and certainly tell someone where you have gone...",127 Hours
54,damianphelps,Man gets stuck in rock,7,30 September 2020,"So that's the plot in a nutshell. Man gets stuck in rock.However the film is far more, delivering personal examination in a moment of crisis successfully delivered by Boyle and Franco.Its smart enough not to run too long or try to be the answer to life the universe and everything (the answer to that question is 42...look it up!), rather it focuses on telling a story and taking us on a simple yet painful journey.Very good storytelling.",127 Hours
55,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Boyle and Franco turn a true survival story into a powerful statement about living,9,29 November 2010,"As demonstrated by his ability to earn acclaim in everything from zombie films (""28 Days Later"") to foreign coming-of-age love stories (""Slumdog Millionaire""), Danny Boyle has an extraordinary gift as a filmmaker and in ""127 Hours,"" he channels it into an extraordinary story of human willpower. This could have easily been a compelling but plain and ordinary documentary on the Discovery Channel or National Geographic about a man pinned under a boulder who miraculously survives. Boyle, however, transforms it into a powerful statement about the will to live and where that motivation truly comes from.""127 Hours"" does not simply prove the point that humans will do whatever it takes to survive in dire circumstances. In fact, I might argue 9 of 10 people wouldn't do what Aron Ralston (James Franco) does in this film. Anyway, Boyle makes it his mission to use Ralston's incredible true story -- one that told at face value would probably just elicit gasps -- to alter our perspective on living. What's obvious is that none of the impact of ""127 Hours"" is possible without Franco. A film about a man trapped in a crevice for more than five days needs a heck of a lead actor and Franco, despite few dramatic credits to this point, proves beyond capable. Although boredom might set in for some during this film given its plot, the believability of Franco's performance remains constant and irrefutable. He possesses the fun-loving and care-free charisma of Ralston then slowly breaks that shell and shows his human fragility.Yet remarkably, Boyle leaves a substantial thumbprint on the film, much of which he shares with co-writer Simon Beaufoy, also of ""Slumdog."" Because the story is so straightforward, Boyle recognizes imagery and perception provide his only means of creativity. He shows us inside the tube of Ralston's water backpack, water bottle and other close-ups, all of which seem unnecessary, but they establish images which we will come to think about with a different perspective as the film wears on, such as when Aron drinks his own settled urine out of the water pouch. Boyle uses the same process shot, but suddenly we don't see it the way we did earlier and they become more meaningful than tedious.This subtly effective technique can also be found in the beginning and ending shots of the film. It seems completely random that Boyle would open with crowded streets of people as if he's tricked us and really made ""Slumdog 2,"" but the image gains significance after experiencing Ralston's journey.""127 Hours"" will not be kind to people who don't take lightly to seeing blood outside of the ""shoot 'em up"" genre. Many of these people will leave the film thinking all they got was shock value, but of course there's much more to it. Despite the ""how will he survive?"" plot, a substantial amount of time is placed on flashes to memories Aron thinks of regarding his family, fantasies and of course, regrets. Boyle beautifully shows us that although survival seems an inherently selfish thing, much of that motivation and will to live comes from other people, even total strangers. Aron thinks a lot of the girls (Kata Mara and Amber Tamblyn) he hiked with just hours before the accident though otherwise he'd have likely forgotten them.The build-up and catharsis of Aron's story might not be the most powerful and uplifting based-on-true-story you've witnessed, but ""127 Hours"" clearly surpasses expectation in terms of the message it sends and the impact it leaves. With it, Boyle solidifies his place as one of those filmmakers you must always have an eye on and Franco emerges as a relatable everyman with above-everyman-grade talent.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",127 Hours
56,jzappa,Eliminating the Sieve,8,29 April 2011,"Occasionally someone will make a huge misstep and get loads of time to dwell on it. Aron Ralston, the hero of the ninth feature film by the skillful, vitalizing Irish director Danny Boyle, has one of those. He goes hiking in the rough country without telling anyone where he's going, and then in a cavernous, constricted crevice, gets his forearm ensnared between a boulder and the canyon wall. What would you do? I'm not sure if I could've done what he does. It entails a grisly test for Aron, and for us. It's not always easy watching him do it. Yet, as always, from such traumatic roots, it's quite awe-inspiring what a compelling and gratifying film Danny Boyle has made out of it.As gut-wrenching as it is genuinely moving, this flashy, rousing but ultimately intimate and inspiring adventure docudrama fuses one of Boyle's most stunningly lively directorial efforts with an excellent performance from James Franco. For the bulk he contends with one approximately 10-foot-radius space, and one actor. There's a happy-go-lucky preamble in which Aron and a pair of young trekkers have a swim in an underwater cave. Later, in figments of the imagination, other people and pared-down events from his life appear to pop in.The film heroes who involve me most are not loud. They don't swagger to a beat, make lugubrious moral proclamations and restore faith in the inherent good of the world. They're common people confronted with a necessity and face their predicament. Indeed, Boyle interestingly enough refers to as his version of The Wrestler in regards to creating the portrait of an existentially desperate protagonist. Franco does first-rate work signifying the two necessary features of Ralston's character. He's a brash, overconfident traveler who trusts his dexterity and loves skating on thin ice, and, contrarily though it'd seem, he's got horse sense and animal instinct enough to do inconceivable but necessary things to himself to survive. One characteristic finds his predicament, and the other solves it.The question is, Can you take it? It's absolutely gripping. Films like this are neither fast-paced nor leisurely. They feel largely like they're all one moment. They exploit our profound nightmare of being confined somewhere and finding that there doesn't appear to be any means of escaping. Aaron is at any rate opportune to be standing on a stable footing. One can imagine the boulder lodging a little higher, leaving him suspended from the ensnared arm.Abruptly, his world has become very clear. There's the crevice, the sliver of sky above, traversed by an eagle on its recurring flight path, his camcorder, decreasing water and food and his insufficient little utensil. Who can hear him shout? The two girls have long since made tracks and won't realize he's missing. For anyone to happen to discover him is unimaginable. He'll die or act.Equal parts food for thought and triumph of the spirit, 127 Hours is a task in overcoming the unfilmable. Boyle employs superb cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle and Enrique Chediak, determining the immensity of the Utah wilds, and the extremely particular minutiae of Ralston's trivial ration of it. His editor, Jon Harris, accomplishes the subtle mission of showing his crucial act of bodily harm exclusive of ever totally showing it. For us, the nastiest moment is not an image but a blood-curdling, stomach-turning sound. Most of us have never heard this sound before, although we know precisely what it is.Torture and violence are so everyday in the movies. They're seldom amplified to the degree of true medical reality. We and the characters feel impervious. 127 Hours eliminates the sieve. It connects us. One aspect that cinema can indicate but can't induce is the violence of the grief concerned. I can't conceive of what Aaron endures. Possibly, that made it simpler for the real Ralston, because no matter how, his choice controlled the length of his misery.Boyle's stylized, claustrophobic drama warily doesn't make him a hero, more of a skilled sportsperson caught by a transitory determination. He could've easily been the guy in the adventure films whose bones and tattered clothes Hollywood characters find long after. He does what he must, which makes the film so gratifying. We could do it, too. The choice is in our blood, which chooses to go on.",127 Hours

Of course, relying on Franco to steer it, like Hanks in Castaway, again he doesn't disappoint and we're right there with him, feeling the frustration and anger, waiting out those long hours in unforgiving heat. Some beautiful photography, that lake inside that cave, made me jump into it. This is a drama, that makes you appreciate what you can lose, on taking off, and what can result from the irresponsibility of not informing someone of your wherabouts. But when you're gotta go, you gotta go. Franco makes his very natural and human performance, watchable. The end music score of triumph, and hope is fantastic. As though it doesn't really come off as main stream cinema, as a little trite, it's really the movie's message of the human spirit, which is it's main objective.",127 Hours
58,Turfseer,Carbon copy of real event still ends as a riveting tale of survival,8,22 February 2011,"I wanted to see '127 Hours' because I kept wondering how anyone can make a film about a guy who gets his arm stuck under a boulder while hiking in the desert and then has to cut it off. Not only was I aware of the whole concept of the film and the ending but I also was wondering how do you make an interesting film about someone who is stuck in one small place for such a long period of time.To my great surprise, '127 Hours' is a riveting tale of one man's survival in the face of certain death. How does director Danny Boyle pull it off? For starters, James Franco is a brilliant casting choice to play Aron Ralston, the daredevil hiker who ends up between a 'rock and a hard place'. Franco is an immensely likable fellow who conveys Ralston's reckless and devil may care attitude that leads him to his date with destiny. When Ralston meets the two female hikers and escorts them to an underground grotto where they go swimming, Boyle uses that scene to reinforce our perception of Ralston as a daredevil, who risks his own life (as well as the lives of two strangers) as he seeks one more thrill, sliding between a crevice, and diving into the grotto, from a distance that an ordinary person would consider to be unsafe.The incredible thing about '127 Hours' (and I found this out after I watched the film) is that almost everything that we see actually happened. Ralston did have a video camera and filmed himself while his arm was stuck under the rock. And the video camera that was used in the film, was also the actual camera Ralston used when he was trapped! Boyle builds the tension simply by documenting everything that happened. At first Ralston believes he can move the rock through sheer strength. When that fails, he tries to be more calculating by using a pocket knife to chip away at the rock but soon discovers that plan is completely ineffectual (adding to the tension is the scene where Ralston drops the knife and must retrieve it by attaching a bent wire and guiding it down to where the knife has fallen, by placing the wire between his toes).Calling upon his survival skills, Ralston then designs an elaborate pulley system, hoping he'll be able to lift the rock, by using the weight of his body to move it. Finally, when that fails, he must concentrate on conserving the little water he has left, and figure out some other plan to extricate himself from his dire predicament. Boyle switches things up by introducing scenes in which Ralston begins hallucinating. In one such harrowing scene, after a cloud burst above in the desert, water cascades down into the crevice where Ralston is trapped, and he sees himself drowning. In another hallucinatory scene, Boyle introduces some comic relief by having Ralston imagine himself as a game show contestant, mocked by canned laughter due to his short-sightedness in failing to tell anyone where he was going.As to the amputation itself, I was relieved it wasn't as gruesome as I had anticipated. Actually, it was more fascinating than terrifying. In an earlier scene, Ralston discovers that he is unable to sever his arm using his small dull knife. Later, however, he figures out that he must break his arm in two places and then use the plier part of his knife kit to literally grind and twist until he cuts off his arm.As a result of this life changing event, Ralston has the epiphany that he had taken his family and friends for granted. Visions of the family and friends appear during the denouement and at the very end, Ralston himself, swimming in a pool, without his prosthesis, This of course suggests that the amputation has not squelched Ralston's love of the outdoors and taste for adventure. But one thing is for sure: when he takes a trip, he'll never again fail to tell those he is close to, where he is going.The cinematography and the editing is superb here in both the expansive exterior shots and in the claustrophobic area where Franco maneuvers. True, '127 Hours' is basically a carbon copy of a true event, but Director Danny Boyle manages to take a story where we already know the ending and still made it gripping and compelling. That, of course, is no easy feat!",127 Hours
59,freemantle_uk,Did you here about the man who had to cut off his own arm?,8,6 January 2011,"Winning an Oscar is normally a golden ticket for a director to make any film their want. Danny Boyle certainly used his Oscar winning status to its full advantage and made sure a project he wanted to make for a while was commissioned.127 Hours is the true story about Aron Ralston (James Franco), a 27-year-old climber and adventurer. In 2003 Aron goes off to Blue John Canyon to explore and have fun, meeting two young ladies on the way, Kristi (Kate Mara) and Megan (Amber Tamblyn). After they leave Aron ends up getting his arm trapped in a crack in the Earth and for the next 127 hours he has do everything he can to survive and tries to free his arm. As he does this he think about his love ones, his mum (Kate Burton), Dad (Treat Williams), sister and ex-girlfriend Rana (Clemence Posey) as he thinks about how selfish he has been and how no one will find him.Danny Boyle is a great director having made Trainspotting, 28 Days Later and Slumdog Millionaire. He has such a great visual style and he brings it to a film which most directors would struggle to make visual. Boyle uses some really great tricks, from the zooming in and out of canyons into underground pools or show the crack in the world. To expand the setting Boyle and the screenwriter Simon Beaufoy showed flashbacks and memories to make 127 Hours more then just a man talking to a camera and trying to get his arm free. We get to see Aron grow, being regretful and remorseful and that he is a resourceful but reckless man. James Franco does offer an excellent performance and we possibility get a Oscar nod.Boyle did give the film an almost documentary style because he uses places the camera in one position as people talk, keeps editing down to a minimum and uses hand held cameras that follow people and a small camcorder for when Aron leaves messages. But there is no rubbish shaky cam or zooming like there was with Paul Greengrass' Green Zone which looked like an amateur film. The cinematography by Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle of the Utah was wonderful and shows a very strange and unique landscape. A.R. Rahman gives a great score and soundtrack to 127 Hours and Boyle uses the music to add to the build up in the film, like the bit of music that sounds like a heartbeat.Everyone who went to see the film knows that Aron Ralston had to amputate his own arm and Boyle was aware of what the audience do know. He plays on this, using the music and the playing and examining of the knife in anticipation of the coming event. This is a spoiler but I have to say it, the amputation scene was strong, brutal and powerful. Aron had to hack away with a small knife and you really felt the pain when he had to cut through a nerve ending. But I personally whined more when I saw Aron take out a contact lens (but that's because I have a slight phobia of eyeballs).Whilst 127 Hours was a good film, it was not great like some critics made out. I was a little under whelmed and for me the film felt a little hollow. Boyle still made a good film, but its not his best (that right goes to Trainspotting). I expect it will be nominated for some Oscars but it does not deserves to win Best Picture or Best Director (sorry Mr. Boyle).7.5 out of 10.",127 Hours
60,dfranzen70,"Gripping, transcendental",9,9 January 2011,"127 Hours is one of those infrequent movies that makes great use out of its limited resources; in this case, its space. It's about a hiker, played by James Franco, who finds himself partially trapped by a rock, pinned against the wall of a crevasse. It's a stunning, visually visceral film with a couple of gut-churning scenes, but overall it is a magnificent, evocative thriller.Franco is Aron Ralston, a thrill seeker who loves, loves, loves the desert around Moab, Utah. And with good reason; the aerial shots give a terrific sense of just how isolated and beautiful the area is. He's hiking the Blue John Canyon when he runs into inexperienced hikers Kristi (Kate Mara) and Megan (Amber Tamblyn), whom he cheerfully helps get back on track. It's shortly after departing from the young ladies that Aron, descending into a small fissure, slips, dislodging a medium-sized boulder, which inconveniently lands on his right arm, pinning it against the rock wall.Throughout Ralston's ordeal, he reexamines his life and concludes that he's in his position because of his own decisions, and not just the one in which he neglected to tell anyone of his whereabouts. ""All my life I've been heading toward this rock,"" he thinks; his new insight leads him to conclude that he's let a lot of opportunities slip by in his selfish quest to do things on his own.The movie is based on a real-life occurrence, so it's probably no spoiler to learn that the young man does somehow survive his predicament. But it's not that result that makes this so captivating. Even if you've learned beforehand just how Aron is able to extricate himself, the scene is intense, grisly, and tough to watch. It's the kind of scene that makes you want to look away and ahead at the same time.A lot of the film's success depends on Franco himself. Like Ryan Reynolds last year in Buried, Franco is front and center; it's all about Aron, his past and present, and the lack of mobility means much must be told through Franco's expression and one-armed activities. And he's up to the task. Franco's performance here must have been physically excruciating in and of itself, as much of the cavern scenes were filmed in one sitting. But he also brings quite a bit of emotional tension to the role, and I wouldn't be surprised if he managed to get an Oscar nom out of it.The film does have its flaws. One problem in mysteries and other thrillers is the pull-the-rug gambit, wherein the filmmakers make the audience think A, then switch to B, then repeat ad infinitum. After a while, the viewer isn't sure what's real and what they're supposed to think. Here, director Danny Boyle does trick you a few times; is what Aron sees a hallucination, or is it real? Aron makes quick video recordings while trapped, documenting his efforts. This adds more realism (how else would we know what he's done?) and engages the audience. It also allows us to see all sides of the young man; show-off, extrovert, implacable logician, terrified prisoner. Aron's epiphanies are so vivid that we feel as terrible as he does.But there's a big upside to that realism. When the (obvious) ending does come, the result is so cathartic that it's unlikely that an average viewer could be unmoved by it. The emotional buildup during the course of the movie is justified by a denouement that just blew me away.",127 Hours
61,PWNYCNY,Never travel without letting someone know.,8,28 January 2011,"Given the terrifying nature of Aron Ralston's ordeal, the movie was surprisingly low key. Perhaps this was due to the fact of Mr. Ralston's recklessness which led to his mishaps or maybe the sheer senselessness of what he was doing, which seemed to be pointless, self-indulgent, and never explained in the movie. After all, nobody told him to go hiking in the middle of nowhere. Yet that is what he did, and for that he almost lost his life, which is the crux of the story. How he saves himself is amazing. Yet the moment when he finally does free himself seems almost anticlimactic, when it should have been the climax of the movie. To self-amputate a part of one's body is an act of sheer desperation that is horrifying. Although one can root for Mr. Ralston to persevere and to be saved, what cannot be ignored is the sheer recklessness of his behavior that got in that predicament in the first place. Everyone can appreciate his dilemma but it's a dilemma that he brought upon himself, which gives one cause to wonder: Why? James Franco's performance is outstanding.",127 Hours
62,dee.reid,"""127 Hours"" - An hour-and-a-half of a true-life experience",10,2 March 2011,"Director Danny Boyle is quickly becoming the talk of Hollywood big-wigs. He made the excellent Scottish anti-drug import ""Trainspotting"" in 1996 (my personal favorite film of his so far) before re-inventing the zombie sub-genre of horror with ""28 Days Later..."" (2002) and hitting a Hollywood home-run with ""Slumdog Millionaire"" in 2008. He returns to the big screen triumphant with ""127 Hours."" The film was also produced by Christian Colson, who won the Oscar for ""Slumdog"" and was also behind the production of my favorite horror film of the new millennium so far, ""The Descent"" (2005).""127 Hours"" is based on the true story of Aron Ralston (James Franco) - based on Ralston's autobiography ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"" - an avid and passionate rock climber/outdoors-man whose will and determination to survive is tested when he becomes trapped under a boulder for five days during the summer of 2003 and the film charts his initial horror at his circumstances, his repeated failures at trying to free himself, his attempts to survive in the harsh Utah desert with dwindling food and water, his desperation, his acceptance and denial of his presumed fate, and the ultimate sacrifice he makes in order to free himself from his confines at all costs and then finally make it back to civilization all right to tell his tale.What makes this film so spectacular is the amazing performance of James Franco in the lead as Aron Ralston. For a good chunk of this film's 94-minute running time, it's the James Franco show live & uncut (even though Amber Tamblyn and Kate Mara drop in early on as two female hikers named Megan and Kristi, respectively, whom he accompanies briefly); we saw something similar to this when Tom Hanks was trapped alone on a desert island in the Pacific by a plane crash 11 years ago in ""Cast Away"" (2000). Ralston's ordeal, his experiences, his memories, his hallucinations, his premonitions, his suffering - everything that he feels here, we feel as audience members. In that cramped little space with Ralston, his suffering becomes our suffering to bear witness to. With dry humor, daring athleticism and unmistakable acting skill, this is probably James Franco's career performance - after his superb work as Harry Osborn in the ""Spider-Man"" movies.A lesser film would have dragged under the singular location and the fact that we're often staring directly into Franco's face most of the time. But his performance here is what keeps this film alive and moving, and dryly humorous. I'm glad Boyle's initial pick of Cillian Murphy (his alumni from ""28 Days Later..."") as Aron Ralston ultimately failed to pan out the way he wanted it to. If it did, I doubt we would have been able to see how truly amazing a performer Franco was in this film.It's clear from the very start that Ralston has a love and a passion for living life to its fullest, love and passion for the outdoors and extreme sports, and not having any regrets about any of it. But it also shows that he is somewhat vain and arrogant; we also see that he is somewhat selfish and solitary and unappreciative of some of the things he has in his life, like his parents, his friends, and his ex-girlfriend. Because of his apparent denial of the importance of such simple but essential things to his daily existence, his arrogance at failing to even tell anyone about what he was doing or where he was going is probably what ultimately leads to his 127-Hour predicament here.And he even speculates throughout the film that perhaps his life has led up to this moment, that from his childhood up until now, events have slowly built up to him being pinned under a massive boulder and questioning about whether or not he has the will to survive or die out here all alone in this canyon, with only those two women played by Tamblyn and Mara as probably the last people he will ever meet during his final moments on Earth. Danny Boyle makes great use of the outdoors location and the unusual but creative use of cinematography and camera-work: it's interesting to note the juxtaposition between the vast expanse of Utah desert in the early scenes and the confined canyon later on in the film that Ralston was initially prepared to call his tomb.""127 Hours"" is not a 94-minute preach-fest about valuing your life and living life to its fullest, and one man's ultimate struggle to survive under extreme conditions. It's also not overly melodramatic in its bold dramatization of Ralston's harrowing true-life experiences. Those who have read about what actually happened to him back in 2003 in that Utah canyon undoubtedly know the story by now and the much-talked-about sequences later on in the film about how he ultimately freed himself that have reportedly led to audience members passing out at the shock of the extreme measures he takes to triumphantly regain his freedom.Danny Boyle doesn't deny any of this to the viewer and it wouldn't seem right to do so if he did. As stated earlier, the point of this movie is to plunge the audience into Aron Ralston's true-life experiences back in 2003, to make his story more widely known, and to remind viewers that it's always a good idea to leave a note about where you're going and what you're going to be doing.10/10P.S.: The rousing score by A.R.

Danny Boy has done it again in the gripping ""127 Hours"", the movie based on the true story of mountain climber Aaron Ralston.

Boyle is definitely not a lazy director, and his energy and workmanship is shown around the clock in ""127 Hours""; from Aaron's survival skills, to the expeditious visuals of Aaron's adventuristic persona, to Aaron's desperate motives of detachment; I hope I did not have to arm wrestle with your brain in figuring that last one out. Speaking of detachment, the ""arm self-amputation"" scene of the movie is the one that is stirring a buzz in movie world. It's the authenticity of the scene and not so much its graphic nature that makes it work. And of course, the bold Boyle is responsible for its excellence. ""127 Hours"" screenplay was mediocre at best; probably due to the nature of the movie, so I am not trying to take anything away from the film's screenwriters Simon Beaufoy and Boyle himself. Nature and its catastrophic capabilities play an integral role in the film highlighted by the superb technical work of: Cinematographers Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle, Art Director Christopher DeMuri, and Production Designer Suttirat Anne Larlarb. They all deserve Oscar nominations! Jon Harris' master cutting in editing the movie, and A.R. Rahman's master tuning in scoring the movie are also climbing the Oscar mountain of nominations for those applicable categories. But to be ""Franco"" with you, the peak of ""127 Hours"" has to be James Franco's mesmerizing performance as Aaron Ralston. I will give my right arm (I know, wrong choice of words; Sorry Aaron!) to have James Franco be nominated for a Best Actor Oscar nomination. Wait a minute! I don't think I would have to give my right arm since he is already a favorite for a Best Actor Oscar nomination! Sorry, I guess I was arm & hammered when I wrote that last statement. Anyways, Franco's emotional, rawpower thespian work will definitely make the cut as one of the most talked about acting performance of the year. There is not much of a supporting acting ensemble to ""127 Hours"" since it was Franco's showcase. But we did get a treat in seeing veteran actor Treat Williams appear as Aaron's dad; and there were a couple of sharp performances from Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn as mountain climbers that Aaron meets before his downfall. I will not proclaim ""127 Hours"" as the best movie of the year; it still has a few mountains to climb before it reaches that apex. But nevertheless, Franco and Boyle definitely make it worth your while to spend 93 minutes with ""127 Hours"". It rocks! **** Good",127 Hours
64,runamokprods,Masterfully directed and acted,9,7 October 2013,"On one level there's no reason this film should work as well as it does. The story is public knowledge so there's no real suspense in the traditional sense. But between the brilliant direction by Danny Boyle, and the smashing performance by James Franco this transcends to be not a film of suspense, but a character study of a very real, flawed but likable person in a nightmare situation any of us can imagine. We descend into his lonely hell with him and emerged amazed by the resilience of this young man in particular, but also by life in general. Less thrilling, but – more important – far more moving than I expected, Boyle works wonders in making what is essential a one character single location film never feel static or dull, and the gruesome climax almost unbearable to watch without ever feeling exploitive.",127 Hours
65,drqshadow-reviews,Personal Rebirth and Validation Amidst an Impossible Predicament,8,21 September 2016,"James Franco conveys the true-life story of Aron Ralston, a passionate outdoorsman who survives five-plus days trapped in a crevice with his right arm pinned between boulder and Earth. Director Danny Boyle's filmmaking is unexpectedly creative, using the down time of so much isolation to fill us in on Ralston's personal life via fever dreams and life-flashing hallucinations. Open-hearted and playful on the surface, our mountaineer has plenty of demons. And thus, through a lot of soul-searching, this becomes a life-turning moment for him in more than just a physical sense. The scenes leading up to Ralston's eventual escape (by means I expect you'll already know) are among the most raw, tooth-gritting bits I've ever experienced; truly stirring, hyper-empathic filmmaking. Franco is asked to do a lot with very little help, acting solo for a good 75% of the film, and he blossoms, flashing acting chops that I didn't know he had in him. We see desperation, fury, defeat, mania, regret and much more, often through expression and physical acting alone, and it all comes across as absolutely genuine. Not as deep and enveloping as Into the Wild, as existential as The Grey or as flashy as Gravity, it safely finds its own unique nook in the survival subgenre and stands on those merits.",127 Hours
66,alindsay-al,A great dramatic true tale,8,7 May 2016,"I have heard so much about this film and its story and now I have finally seen it and I thought it was great. The premise sees a thrillseeker trapped in a canyon with a boulder trapping his arm as he tries to survive and possibly escape. James franco plays aron the guy who is trapped and my goodness is he brilliant in this film. Giving the best performance of his career he truly encapsulates the pain that this man goes through both physically and mentally as he is trapped in this situation. But his character just feels so real when he uses his humour to deflect the problem, it just makes him very relatable as a person. Kate mara also does a decent job in her small role but this is definitely Franco's film. The story is really intense and as the story progresses you see this man becoming more and more helpless to his situation and its enthralling. The script has some good dramatic moments and dialogue its just some of the situations aren't that interesting to me and left me a bit bored. The style is really powerful and intense with you feeling like you are with franco throughout the film which really works. However, there were a few stylistic decisions taken by danny boyle that I wasn't a huge fan of because it takes you out of the intense situation. Overall this is a great film that is worth at least one viewing.",127 Hours
67,MaxBorg89,A true story that looks fake,5,7 February 2011,"From the get-go, people were skeptical about this film adaptation of Aron Ralston's autobiography Between a Rock and a Hard Place, and for good reason: it's hard to make a compelling drama about a man who spent five days of his life stuck in a canyon. Or, as Danny Boyle puts it: ""The audience has to care for the entire 127 hours, not just the last 40 minutes"" (the contents of which it's best not to disclose in case someone isn't aware of how the story ends). Now, it is remarkable, even commendable, that Boyle used his newfound respectability (read: post-Oscar rise in fame) to get this seemingly impossible project off the ground, but throughout the film there's an awkward truth that emerges: he wasn't the right director for this project.A shame, since the story could lend itself to a good movie, provided certain adjustments were made. As Ralston recounts in his book, he should have told someone where he was going on that fateful day in 2003, when his latest mountain trip turned into a nightmare: stuck between a huge boulder and the mountain wall and unable to move, he quickly ran out of supplies and optimism, giving in to hallucinations and video-messages to his loved ones. Then, on the fifth day, he came up with a brave, shocking solution.The challenge, according to Boyle, was making 127 Hours a film that worked as a full dramatic unit, not just a money shot with an irrelevant build-up. His passion for the project was so big that, for the first time in his career, he has also worked on the script (alongside Slumdog Millionaire partner Simon Beaufoy). And for the first fifteen minutes or so, it looks like he's nailed the tone, capturing Aron's euphoria and naivety as he prepares for the hike, arrives at the canyon and interacts with two attractive girls (Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn) before his unfortunate experience. It's an approach that has worked before - the fun before the tragedy - and it sets up the plot nicely.Unfortunately, once Ralston is stuck (and Boyle with him, so to speak), the director has to figure out how to make the film gripping without leaving the canyon. His solution? He doesn't, allowing for several hallucination and dream sequences that allow him to expand the cast (Kate Burton and Treat Williams as the parents, Lizzy Caplan as the younger sister) and, more importantly, show off his visual trademarks once again. And there lies the real problem with 127 Hours: given the harrowing and very real subject matter, a certain restraint would be expected. Instead, the film is closer in tone to Trainspotting and Slumdog Millionaire, meaning the true story displayed on screen looks too fake and movie-like to fully convince. Okay, so the scenes in question are justified in terms of narrative (Ralston himself has admitted he was hallucinating), but playing them on a loop, like Boyle does (seriously, there's a dream sequence every five minutes), makes for a very repetitive and dull viewing.This also impacts on the central performance, arguably the film's main talking point. Though his talent has never been in question, be it as James Dean, Spider-Man's best friend or a comedy drug dealer, James Franco is justly regarded as one of the finest actors of his generation. However, he's never had to carry an entire movie (well, most of it) like he does here, and it's truly sad that Boyle struggles to keep his camera still, because the pain and despair reflected on Franco's face is the kind of a stuff that, if the overall movie were stronger, would definitely be worthy of an Oscar. Even if the growth (or rather lack thereof) of his facial hair over those five days is absolutely unrealistic.On paper, the combination of material, star and filmmaker was a good match. At the end of it all, though, the result is uneven and unconvincing, and it's all due to the director. Don't get me wrong, Danny Boyle is a very talented filmmaker. It's just that until he finds a way to keep his more visionary instincts in check, he should stay away from movies like this one.",127 Hours
68,estebangonzalez10,127 Hours is James Franco's One-Man Show!,7,9 February 2011,"¨The minute I was born, every breath that I've taken, every action has been leading me to this crack on the out surface.¨127 Hours is Danny Boyle's latest film, after his Oscar winning picture, Slumdog Millionaire. His choice was a rather curious one considering the plot is about a man who gets his arm trapped in a crack of a canyon for 127 hours. The plot doesn't seem to be all that attractive and most of us were already familiar with the true story that the film is based on so there was no real room for surprises. So why has the film been nominated for Best Picture? The answer is simple; Danny Boyle is a great director who happened to cast the right man for the lead role: James Franco. Franco gives one of the best performances of the year. He is just great in this film, which is actually a one man show. 127 Hours is only about 90 minutes long, but Franco's character is trapped in the canyon with very little room for mobility from practically the very beginning (15 minutes into the movie) up to the very end. The entire film focuses on Franco with extreme close ups and his facial expressions are just all on the mark. James Franco is the reason why this film got so many great reviews and was nominated. Danny Boyle also made the film more interesting by resorting to flashbacks, daydreams, and hallucinations, but Franco is the main reason why this movie did as well as it did. I wasn't too much of a fan of Boyle's style of splitting the screen in two or three, but it was still visually stunning and the movie is worth the watch (although I disagree with the nomination for Best Picture).The movie is very faithful to Aron Ralston's autobiographical book, ¨Between a Rock and a Hard Place.¨ The screenplay was adapted by Danny Boyle himself and Simon Beaufoy (The Full Monty and Slumdog Millionaire). It tells the true story of an arrogant mountain climber and outdoors person named Aron Ralston (played by James Franco) who goes out as he usually does every weekend after work into the Canyons in Utah. This weekend he happens to be heading towards the Blue John Canyon, and as usual he leaves without telling anyone where he is going. He is a bit of a solitary person who enjoys being outdoors with the nature and is pretty reckless. He arrives to the Canyon on Friday and on his expedition meets two girls Kristi (Kate Mara) and Megan (Amber Tamblyn) with whom he has a good time and teaches them a thing or two about the site. Little does he know that these will be the last two people he has contact with before the accident. He parts ways with them and starts heading towards the Blue John Canyon crack. Once he arrives and begins descending the crack, a rock falls and lands on his arm, not allowing him to move. He gets stuck in the crack without being able to move the heavy rock and knowing that no one will come searching for him because he hasn't told anyone where he was heading. Aron has hardly any food and only a bottle of water to survive. The title gives away the amount of time Aron remains in the crack, and like I said there are no big surprises because we know the story, but the movie works thanks to Franco.I do not want to give away too much of the film, but most everyone is familiar with Ralston and knows what he does in order to get out (yes he escapes, because if he didn't there would be no autobiography or film so no this isn't a spoiler). I won't say how he does it in case you aren't familiar with it, but all I can say is that it is a very strong and difficult scene to watch. It was really well done and I couldn't help but cringe at the sight of it. It was a very painful scene, but Franco was excellent in it as well. He truly gives a powerful performance, and I won't get tired of repeating it. I can't believe it only took Boyle one take to get it done, it was just perfect. The reason why I'm only giving this film seven out of ten is because I really wasn't hooked by the story. Yes, I liked Franco's performance, but there was nothing new to the story. This would have made for an excellent short film, it would have been perfect, but in 90 minutes I just felt the film was stretched too long. I really didn't care too much for the daydreams or flashbacks; although they did serve the purpose of at least changing the claustrophobic environment for a while. The best scenes were actually the ones in which James Franco would tape his video journal of each day. The one where he imagines he is getting invited to an early TV show and plays the interviewer and himself is just great and proves what a good job Franco did in this movie. I recommend this movie, I just don't agree with the six Oscar nominations it received.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",127 Hours

70,juneebuggy,Great movie even if it did leave me traumatized,9,29 September 2014,"It's been a few days since I watched this and I'm still feeling kinda traumatized, I just can't get that scene with the tendon out of my head. All in this is a pretty fantastic movie, beautifully filmed, exciting, multilayered and wow James Franco who, for the most part carries this all by himself.Its based on the real life events adventurer Aron Ralston faced while trapped in a Utah canyon for five days with his hand stuck under a boulder and how he eventually resorted to desperate measures in order to escape. Ralston filmed a daily video diary while he was stuck and in a lot of the scenes its Franco talking to his little camera, sending a goodbye message to his parents as he gets weaker and weaker from lack of water and his thoughts and (flashback) memories get more bizarre.There were moments watching this when I actually felt sick and I'm not talking about the obvious parts (those were brutal and I watched ""that"" scene peeking through my fingers) but the entire movie made me feel anxious, starting with the foreshadowing of him packing, showing all the food and water and him trying unsuccessfully to find his Swiss army knife, just out of reach on the shelf. The scene with the flood is awesome as is the one where he slides down the chute with the two girls -there is no way I could have done that, so freaky. His determination to survive and finally ASK for help is remarkable. 6/28/14",127 Hours

72,3xHCCH,James Franco's One Man Show,6,13 January 2011,"In ""127 Hours"", James Franco plays Aron Ralston, an alpha male rock- climber who got trapped in a crevice in Utah Canyonwoods Park back in April 2003 when a big rock pinned his right hand. I was curious at how director Danny Boyle was able to expound on this limited premise and get awards buzz, so I watched despite my initial lack of interest. The trapping incident occurs only 15 minutes into the film. From there and the next hour, we get to see Aron talking to himself and to his camera, philosophizing, hallucinating about past and future, as he struggles to survive and extricate himself from this trap. All this, up to the harrowing last 20 minutes when he does escape, all graphically and painfully captured on screen.The spectacular achievement in this film is the beautiful cinematography. The camera work, the composition, lighting and the angles were fantastic. The scenery of the vast canyons, the rolling clouds, the flash flood, the creeping sunbeam, even the water bottle, -- all awesome photography. James Franco has certainly progressed from his Harry Osborne days. He carries this movie all by himself, as there are practically no other supporting characters. This is his one-man show. That scene capturing the moment when Aron first realizes that he is trapped was so naturally done -- a great acting moment for Franco.As I said, initially I did not like to watch this. In all the press releases, we know he will cut off his arm in order to save himself, so there was even no surprise on how the movie will end. You can imagining how singular this incident is, in such an enclosed space, with a particularly gruesome climax. This movie is clearly not for everybody. It shows a man's struggle to survive at all costs. You know the message is positive, but are you willing to watch it? Now, that is another question.",127 Hours
73,aharmas,Only 127?,7,11 November 2010,"I went to see this film because I admire Boyle's work, and after ""Slumdog"" the expectations were high. When you team Franco and Boyle's talents, the results are bound to be interesting, and they are for the most part.Based on the real life story of a hiker whose arm gets trapped during one of his weekend hikes, the film delivers some strong moments, and these work mostly because of Franco's intensity. His sense of despair, anger, frustration, and anger drive the film while the director concentrates on the drama. Unlike Ang Lee and Peter Jackson who can somehow conjure magic to supplement the drama, the triple screen doesn't do much but distract from the central conflict here.On the other hand, Franco's desperate attempts at trying to find use of his resources is interesting and imaginative, and there is a scene involving a sudden flash flood that makes the audience care whether this man will ever make it out of this terrible situation. Very little time is given to the real background of Roston, and too much is spent in the ""delirium"" scenes. It's not that I am in disagreement with the sense that the hiker would have ""gone mad"" with desperation, but at times this device becomes repetitive. We see little about what the family was going through during his disappearance.It's not a bad movie, not as exciting as I expected it to be.",127 Hours
74,valleyjohn,Danny Boyle and James Franco both deserve Oscar's for this.,10,20 January 2011,"Danny Boyle can do no wrong at the moment. He is rapidly becoming one of the world best directors and in the film ""127 hours"" this only enforces that point of view. It's true that you don't appreciate what you have until you are in a position to lose it and the story of Aron Ralston typifies this . James Franco is magnificent in this virtual one man show. Stuck , with his arm wedged by a rock ,miles from anywhere and having not told his family where he was , he is faced with a terrible decision. Does he die or does he cut his arm off to escape? What i love about this film is the way Danny Boyle manages to get Ralston's thoughts during his delusional moments across to the audience. There is one scene where he sees himself picking up the son he has not had yet and it's very moving. Inevitably , all the talk will be of the scene where he cuts his arm off and while it is horrific it's only a small part of what is a brilliant movie. If James Franco and Danny Boyle do not get nominated for an Oscar for this film it will be a major injustice because this movie is so much better than films like Social Network and Inception. A must see.",127 Hours
75,Samiam3,A potentially profound adventure handled like it wasn't. (Just not bad),6,11 June 2011,"Aron Ralston is trapped in a canyon in Arizona with his arm wedged between the canyon wall and a boulder. He has half a bottle of water, a pair of wire cutters, a video camera, and nobody around to hear him.considering the hype for this film and the intensity of the premise, I was a little disappointed at the execution. To put it as literally as I can, director Danny Boyle takes a story that is potentially terrifying and he turns it into a music video. It moves too fast and contains disorienting flashbacks, clumsy cuts, over exaggerated music ques, and misuse of split screening. There is little sense of subjectivity or patience to the film. It shows a lack of faith in the attention span of its audience.James Franco is easily more vibrant than anything in his previous career, but he doesn't embody the character as well as I had hoped. I didn't sense the desperation of the situation in his performance. He plays it quiet when it should be loud, and sometimes vice versa. Another problem with the character is that Boyle cuts around him too much.As many mistakes as I felt Boyle made, He hasn't yet disappointed me as a photographer. Sunshine, Slumdog Millionaire, and even The Beach (which was slop) were vibrant and well shot. 127 Hours is easily the most vibrant of them all, making effective use of colour temperature, scope, and camera angles. One angle in particular worth noting is the intimacy of being inside Aron's video camera. There is also a memorable moment where we follow a rusty tool as it digs into his bloodstream. This brings me to my next point.The much discussed arm cutting scene is seriously over hyped. I can name a dozen films that will make you more squeamish. Therefore, if this is the reason you've chosen to avoid 127 Hours then it's the wrong reason. A better reason might be to mark me when I tell you that it's a rather miscalculated experience, good in parts but too shallow and flashy for its own good.",127 Hours

77,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,127 Hours (2010),7,13 December 2011,"Boyle shows his true talent by directing a film about not much. Franco carries the film very well. It's pretty much just him. It's great to see him also adding layers of interest, by taking him from sympathetic, to just pathetic, and then back again. Boyle livens things up in such a claustrophobic environment, with some truly imaginative and often scary dream sequences. I'll never look at Scooby-Doo the same again. It started off on the wrong foot, with painful editing, jazzing it into some lifeless unfocused trash. I really had trouble liking this at first. It seemed like a first time director, and not someone like Boyle, whom should be confident by now. Things did turn around, even if the music was too intrusive at times.

78,raulfaust,Death Hours,6,23 January 2012,"Well, since all decent IMDb's reviewers already gave their opinions about this movie, I felt obligated to see and give mine. ""127 Hours"" is pretty similar to the polemic ""Buried"" and came out two or three months after the second mentioned. Whilst in ""Buried"" 100% of the scenes involve Ryan Reynolds in a coffin, this one alternates between James Franco's agony and flashes of his mind. Both these movies are agonizing and make the spectator feel very sorry for the main character, even thought the protagonist never showed a reason for us to like him. My main complaint about ""127 Hours"" is that Franco, in many scenes, seems to be TOO calm for someone who is that close to death; when people are about to die they simply get crazy-- our survival's instinct attacks. The photography direction is beautiful, this picture is surely a professional work; it's just a shame that films involving this trouble will never be completely entertaining-- it will get boring sometimes. That's it, ""127 Hours"" is a good movie of its subject, but is the kind of picture you have to be very patient to truly enjoy.",127 Hours
79,Matt_Layden,A great performance from Franco.,8,3 April 2011,"I applaud the film for being as entertaining and engrossing as it could possibly be, considering it's about a guy who gets his hand trapped by a big boulder and he just stands there for the rest of the film. I knew Danny Boyle would be able to pull it off though, the guy is talented. Aron Ralston, an adrenalin junkie, becomes trapped under a boulder while canyoneering by by his lonesome in Utah. He tries all he can to escape, but it's not enough, until he's faced with the alternative, death. He takes drastic measures to ensure his life will prevail. I walked away from the film with one thought in my mind, could I do the same thing. Well, for one thing I wouldn't be alone, but in this situation, I would definitely try everything I could to try and get out of that situation first. Would I pass out from cutting off my own arm? Who knows, but I do know that the will to live is indeed a powerful thing. The film displays this tremendously. Beautifully shot and wonderfully edited, the film grabs you from the moments it starts and never lets you go. I was astonished to hear that some people were bored by it. Given the circumstances, I asked what did they expect from a movie about a guy who's trapped by a boulder. The real Ralston has stated that the film is as close to the real thing as anything, it could be a documentary. Another feat accomplished by Boyle and Franco, to truly capture the man in his most desperate moments. Ralston gave his seal of approval to the film and the performance, so do I.The scene in which he has to cut off his own arm is not as graphic as I expected. It surely does look real enough though. I can easily recommend this film, Boyle delivers another great film that he can add to his impressive resume. Franco gives his best performance to date.",127 Hours
80,Chase_Witherspoon,Slipping through the cracks,8,31 July 2015,"Avoided this movie for some time mainly as I was sceptical that the subject matter could sustain 90-odd minutes without resorting to incessant flashbacks or some tawdry, laboured struggle. Being pinned to a specific location for 127 hours doesn't offer a lot of material to manufacture a 90 minute film, but I'm pleased to say director Danny Boyle has exceeded my own expectations with a taut thriller that's well photographed and exceptionally well-acted by the often maligned James Franco.Despite knowing little of the real-life genesis of this film (though familiar with the 'climax' depicted in much more graphic detail than I anticipated), the unimaginable despair doesn't need a baseline truth to be compelling. This is one of those films where apparently, truth is stranger than fiction. Franco's trademark nonchalance is an attribute to his character here, and he does manage to affect the contrast well, as his situation becomes more dire. If there was one disappointment, it was that I didn't get to see more of Kate Mara, whose character failed to evolve despite its potential. Great movie, well-constructed, visually appealing and a decent soundtrack.",127 Hours
81,brando647,James Franco's Best Performance,9,21 August 2011,"Movies that are anchored in a single location (in this case, a canyon in Utah) appeal to me. I love the idea that movies of this nature rely on the talent of the performer and not so much on action, special effects, etc. Celebrated filmmaker Danny Boyle adapts the true life story of adventurous outdoorsman Aron Ralston. Ralston has been quoted in regards to the accuracy of the film as saying it's as close as you can get to a documentary while still being a narrative film. Ralston is known for a disastrous adventure into the canyons of Utah in which he was doing some hiking and, after a nasty fall, found himself trapped with a boulder pinning his arm to the canyon wall. For the following couple of days, Ralston documented his experience with his small video camera and survived on what little food he'd brought and a dwindling water supply. The end of the film has become famous for the extreme lengths Ralston had gone to to free himself from the canyon. I'm sure everyone knows how the film ends by this point, but in the event that someone reading this is oblivious, I'll avoid mentioning it. Needless to say, it's pretty painful to watch.Before 127 HOURS, I'd only known actor James Franco as Harry Osborn from Sam Raimi's SPIDER-MAN trilogy and a spaced-out pot dealer in PINEAPPLE EXPRESS. I was more than a little skeptical that Franco, who I hadn't seen in any serious sort of role, could pull off carrying a dramatic picture by himself. But I suppose I should've given director Danny Boyle the benefit of the doubt that he knew what he was doing. Franco does a great job. He's a talented man, and his work in 127 HOURS proves it. Over the course of Ralston's time trapped in the canyon, Franco runs the gamut from determined and hopeful to ready for the inevitable and he does such a fine job that he brings the audience along with him. Ralston's constant updates into his camcorder give us some insight into what he's going through, seeing as how he has no one to talk to. Franco is powerful as he reaches out to his parents whom he knows won't receive his message until after he's found (most likely too late). He reminisces back to mistakes he's made and moments he regrets, his entrapment giving him a new view on life.Now yes, Danny Boyle is a great director but I know what's most likely to be the bigger selling point for the film is the final act in which Ralston gets down to business when he realizes what he's going to need to do to survive his predicament. Even those who've been desensitized to violence might have a hard time not flinching. It's not overdone and a lot of it is done off screen, but it's done incredibly well and has the audience grimacing. Keep in mind, this even doesn't happen until the last 10-15 minutes of the movie. So if it's your sole reason for inquiring into the film, you'll want to get comfortable and settle in for one of the best movies of 2010 in the meantime.",127 Hours
82,moviewizguy,Every Second Counts,8,16 November 2010,"127 HOURS is the true story of mountain climber Aron Ralston's remarkable adventure to save himself after a fallen boulder crashes on his arm and traps him in an isolate canyon in Utah. (Fox Searchlight)127 HOURS may seem like a mix of SAW and BURIED, the latter which was recently released to theaters, but, honestly, I have to say that it's more gut wrenching than SAW and more emotionally draining than BURIED, although I'm not trying to say both of those films are bad. It just puts you right into a harrowing situation and never lets you go until the end, but you'll be glad you stayed through. As much as it is a hard film to sit through, the film is mainly about hope and the will to survive, which I like because I'm not a pessimistic person.James Franco gives the performance of his career and carries the film really well on his shoulders, which is a good thing considering we're with him for the rest of the film. Although Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn, two lovely actresses, have short roles in the film, it's always nice to see them. The editing plays a huge role in the film as well. It has a similar eccentric visual style like director Danny Boyle's previous film, SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE.Overall, Danny Boyle does it once again, proving everybody that he's one of the few fantastic directors out there working in the film industry, along with Christopher Nolan and Quentin Tarantino. Franco gives a terrific performance and the film is both gripping and emotional until the very end.",127 Hours
83,bandw,Young and healthy and invincible,8,22 May 2011,"This true story is simple enough. Aron Ralston sets out for a weekend trip to a slot canyon in the Canyonlands National Park in Utah, gets pinned by a boulder, and after five days frees himself and makes it out alive. The movie succeeded in dramatizing the event in a manner that kept my attention. The introduction that has Ralston bicycling in some twenty miles to the entry of the canyon was the highlight of the film for me. It captured the thrill of being alone in a spectacularly magical and beautiful landscape and feeling truly alive. This part of the movie makes a great advertisement for Utah. A Canyonlands travelogue on Blu-ray would make for great entertainment.It was dumb for Ralston not to have told anyone where he was going, which he admits, but I am willing to give him a pass on this, at least from what we see of him in the movie. He was in his 20s, in the peak of health, and an experienced outdoors-man--I could see how he might feel invincible and make the mistake he did.Whereas this movie personalizes the experience, I found the NBC Dateline documentary ""Desperate Days in Blue John Canyon"" to have a greater emotional impact. In that film Tom Brokaw accompanies Ralston on a repeat of his fateful journey. This was only six months after the original event and it astonished me that Ralston had the courage to do it. Fitted with a prosthesis he made the whole trip without aid, from lowering himself into the canyon to the repel out. Seeing some of Ralston's actual video as well as hearing the audio of other parts had a much greater impact on me that seeing Franco duplicate it, even as good as Franco is in the role. And we are spared seeing the graphic details of the main event--hearing Ralston describe it is quite enough. This documentary is available on YouTube.It's easy to be convinced of the fragility of life, but the value of this movie is to see the other end of that spectrum, what a body can withstand at the outer limits of endurance.",127 Hours

The movie starts with A.R.Rahman's magical & spellbinding powerful music. The whole movie is like a quality product, which never for a second let you feel boredom. Sometimes it gets really hard to watch the One person's agony on screen but just like Buried, 127Hours also did a commendable job in engaging the audience. Here, 127 Hours gets more applause as it's inspired from a true story. There were two completely different scenes which left me Speechless. James Franco Jumping into Canyon with Kate Mara & Amber Tamblyn creates exhilarating feeling inside me, it makes you wanna jump along with them. The second most favorite scene is Obviously James Franco Amputating his own Arm...It takes really a Big Heart to go through the whole scene; I can imagine why people fainted during that scene. It's undoubtedly James Franco's finest work, I don't have words to express his portrayal of Aron Ralston. There are hundreds of emotions he has shown to us and keep us immensely engaging. He truly deserves an Oscar Nod, I haven't seen Ryan Gosling (Blue Valentine), Colin Firth (The King's Speech) yet, but I have seen Jeff Bridges (True Grit), Nonetheless Jess Bridges was outstanding in ""True Grit"" but what James Franco brought to 127 Hours, it happens in Ages. Kate Mara, Amber Tamblyn and Clemence Poesy were Charming. Overall, it's a terrific movie with amazing combination of exceptional direction by Danny Boyle, Extraordinary Music by A.R.Rahman, Breathtaking Cinematography by Enrique Chediak & Anthony Dod Mantle AND Oscar worthy performance by James Franco.",127 Hours
86,sme_no_densetsu,Impressive movie-making from Danny Boyle,8,29 May 2011,"""127 Hours"" is Danny Boyle's follow-up to the highly acclaimed ""Slumdog Millionaire"". For it, he assembled a crew that included ""Slumdog"" Oscar winners Simon Beaufoy (screenwriter) and A.R. Rahman (composer). The film garnered six richly deserved Oscar nominations but unfortunately failed to win any.The true story concerns mountain climber Aron Ralston who becomes trapped in an isolated canyon in Utah. With his arm pinned under a heavy boulder his outlook is bleak but he courageously refuses to give up. About three quarters of the film takes place stuck in one spot but Boyle & Beaufoy keep the action interesting by incorporating flashback and dream sequences.The film is practically a one man show with James Franco tackling the Ralston role. It's a demanding role and one that sees Franco deliver on the promise that he showed years ago. He would have been a deserving Oscar winner but faced tough competition from Colin Firth. Besides Franco there are a handful of other notables in small roles, all of whom contribute solid performances.Boyle's direction is superb and nothing if not Oscar worthy. Like Franco, Boyle was presented with a tough task and rose to the challenge. Credit should also be given to co-screenwriter Simon Beaufoy and editor Jon Harris for keeping the narrative flowing. Then there's the stellar music by A.R. Rahman blending canny soundtrack choices and mood-enhancing original music. All were rewarded with Oscar nominations but lost out to ""The Social Network"". Meanwhile, the dazzling cinematography of Enrique Chediak & Anthony Dod Mantle was undeservedly snubbed by the Academy.All in all, ""127 Hours"" is a highly compelling film graced with superlative production values and a top-notch lead performance. The only drawback is that the film's conclusion is never in doubt, seeing as how the movie is based on an autobiography. Hardly a fault of the filmmakers' but it's a testament to their skill that the movie is so gripping in spite of the outcome being known beforehand.",127 Hours
87,Screen_Blitz,"Danny Boyle's intense, thought-provoking account on the true story of a man's survival is not just outstanding, but simply spellbinding to its core",10,24 September 2015,"One thing 2008's Oscar Winner 'Slumdog Millionaire' proved is that Danny Boyle is a man with a directorial gift pounding with a force to reckoned with. And that only makes up a majority of the reason of why the English director makes a marvelous choice to take the fascinating true story of Aron Ralston and energize it to life with electrifying precision. The story of Aron Ralston, a man who in 2003, faced an unfortunate situation during his exploration in a beautiful sunny desert that left him crippled from the world before making a difficult decision that most people would think, perhaps more times, about doing. The man's story of survival is brought to the screen with such powerful energy and a magnetic performance by lead James Franco it isn't too far below what could almost be considered a masterpiece. While that may be saying a lot, it is only an expression how admirable Boyle and Franco prove to make a good team when honoring the survival of a man who fought against near impossible odds. Set in 2003, James Franco plays Ralston, a man living in southern Utah who takes a hiking trip in the Blue John Canyon. Exploring the wonders of the land and running into two women (played by Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn) who he goes for a swim with before departing, his trip starts off as a dream come true. That is until he takes a nasty spill down a canyon followed a boulder that pins his arm against the wall. Trapped with his arm completely incapacitated and unable to move to the boulder even an inch, Ralston must do everything he can to survive. As the titles claims, the subject character is trapped for an astonishing amount of time, and the cruel assault to injury is that he has no food or water and is forced to resort to drinking his urine. Danny Boyle brings the harrowing account of the poor man's desperate survival to vigorous authenticity, and does so without resorting to exploitative territory. Boyle boasts extraordinary effort to inject liveliness and subtly into the central figure's fight for survival, while appointing James Franco with the daring task of carrying the film on his shoulders. To remarkable effort, Franco proves tremendous in this task, electrifying his role with both energy and soul, particularly in the more emotional-driven bits where he reminises about his family. Collaborating with Boyle once again is Anthony Dod Mantle who boasts absorbing camera work to tightly capture the claustrophobic atmosphere of Aron Ralston's severely cramped environment, and not before soaring the camera around the desert to capture the warming beauty of the Blue John Canyon. And when the film eventually stations its focus on Ralston suffering his unpleasant predicament, every grueling detail of his misery is powerfully apprehended on both visual and emotional scope. This feat also brings out the nightmare feasting on audiences' eyes during the incredibly gruesome finale when Ralston makes an almost unimaginable decision, and if you are familiar with the story, you know how it ends; and the only strongest of stomach would be in the safest capacity to withstand the brutality of this scene. Again, the deeper the film travels into detail, the more riveting it gets as it paints an unforgettable picture of a man who's will to survive outwitted the pain he endures.127 Hours is an intense, riveting, and an astoundingly thought- provoking testament on its true-story-based subject. It is a fascinating account on its central figure, carrying an amazing amount of gravity and liveliness only Danny Boyle is capable of establishing. While not the most uplifting picture, it is one that many can deeply admire, especially with the appeal of James Franco at hand.",127 Hours
88,Troy_Campbell,Compelling viewing.,8,25 February 2011,"Although undeniably amazing, the story of Aron Ralston isn't something that strikes you as ripe for cinematic treatment. It's more the sort of yarn suited to a half hour doco, seeing as the action is stuck in the one place for five days. It's a marvel then – although not overly surprising – that Danny Boyle and Simon Beaufoy, director and writer respectively of the phenomenal Slumdog Millionaire, have eked out a worthy story that capably fits the feature film format.They've developed the premise to focus more on the mentality of Ralston during his suffering. He cycled through a gamut of emotions – regret, despair, acceptance, anger, frustration, embarrassment – and how Boyle presents these is definitely left of centre, but all the more intriguing for it. The use of flashbacks and dream segments are often lazily used to convey a character's thoughts, although they're still a damn fine narrative tool if you use them correctly and Boyle wonderfully segues in and out of these sequences as if they were an extension of the present action.Some of Ralston's delirium-fuelled moments are cringe-worthy and humiliating, but Boyle doesn't shoot them with a rose coloured lens. What you see is an authentic depiction of how this man (re)acted to the gradual realisation these were his last days on earth. When you're on your own with no hope of surviving, why concern yourself with something trivial like how you might look if there was ever a movie made about you? Well, Ralston didn't and Boyle respected that. Subsequently we, the audience, have been privy to something we weren't supposed to see, and there is something very fascinating about that.Cillian Murphy was originally planned to play the doomed adventurer, and though I'm sure he would've been great, it's now hard to imagine anyone other than James Franco in the role. The real Ralston had never allowed anyone outside of his own family and friends to see the camcorder footage he shot over those harrowing 127 hours, until he permitted both Franco and Boyle to watch it. This private screening must've been invaluable to Franco especially; his portrayal is carefully layered and well thought out. Franco slots into the ""everyman"" mould with ease and offers a quirky side to Ralston without ever being overtly quirky. Colin Firth should win the Best Actor Oscar for The King's Speech, but Franco thoroughly deserves his nomination and I'm sure we haven't seen the last of him come future awards seasons.An ordinary man placed in an extraordinary situation is compelling viewing thanks to Boyle's masterful direction and Franco's powerful performance.4 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Fine, 3 - Good, 4 - Great, 5 - Brilliant)",127 Hours
89,dunmore_ego,Arm-ageddon.,8,19 August 2011,"It's primal fear time.Betcha when Aron Ralston started his canyon hike that Saturday morning, he didn't think that by 10 a.m. he'd be swimming in a subterranean cavern with two hot chicks, that by Wednesday he'd be drinking his own urine and that by Thursday he'd be carving his own arm off...127 HOURS is the intense shock-rock account of how young adventure-seeker and canyoneer Ralston (James Franco) got his right hand and forearm trapped under a rock in Blue John Canyon near Moab, Utah in April 2003, having not told anyone where he was going, and of how he survived for five days and ultimately escaped his 800-pound stone cufflink.127 HOURS is like a gruesome car accident - you don't wanna look, but you can't turn away.When Ralston falls down a gulch and realizes his arm is trapped under a falling boulder, his dismay is soon overcome by frustration when he can't shift the boulder or pull his arm loose. He screams, ""This is insane!"" as we all would, because in this modern world, things like this not only don't happen to us, but CAN'T happen to us. Like the abandoned couple in OPEN WATER, we think we're too technological, too evolved, too sophisticated for these menial mishaps. Ralston peers up at the sliver of blue sky above the gulch and sees a faraway plane. It's surreal that in this world overrun by people, not one other soul knows where he is...He thinks back to his last hours in civilization; how he didn't pick up his mother's call, how he didn't tell his co-worker where he was going, and even how he misplaced his Swiss army knife, saddled instead with a cheap multi-tool, which would have to go above and beyond its call of duty to pull off a gory task.He starts a filmic commentary on his vidcam, one of his first ruminations that his hand has not had circulation for 24 hours, ""It's probably gone."" Horrifying thought! Even if you did escape now, that part of your body is destroyed irrevocably. Then the corollary thought: how long can the rest of your body maintain with one part of it slammed off from regular function? The blood is being squeezed through forcibly-created pathways to avoid that dead junction - how long before the machine busts a piston? On the third day, Ralston starts talking of his heart palpitating three times faster than normal.He starts conserving his food (2 burritos) and water (1 flask); jerry-rigs an ingenious sling to try to shift the rock; chips away at the stone with the multi-tool. He dreams... of his ex-girlfriend, of parties, of being freed - and wakes to stone-cold reality (isn't that the worst, stomach-curdling feeling in the world?); noises in the dark, delirium, wild thoughts...Director Danny Boyle is intent on making us feel everything Ralston felt, force-feeding us his emotional arc, through periods of sanguinity and desperation, frivolity and fear, and his ultimate descent into insanity and then clarity and then a hybrid of both; after all, how insane/sensible do you have to be to realize your only option is to break both the bones in your forearm and carve it off to escape? James Franco goes where few actors have been - no, not down a gulch in Utah - into the mind of a man who calmly assessed self-mutilation for survival. And went through with it! Of course, our own primal fears were awakened long before Ralston made the decision. It is WE who are trapped, it is WE who will die slowly or risk brain-searing pain, and ultimately... it is WE whose arms Ralston is cutting into! Boyle and Franco take us there, capturing not just the mental state, but (with the jolting use of fizzling audio and red meat editing) also capturing that ineffable yet jarringly familiar sensation of electric, teeth-fraying pain, as Ralston cuts through his tendons, nerves exposed. At that point, we would welcome fingernails down a blackboard.When his arm comes away and he stumbles backwards - that blank look - it's like his brain has fried its last cell trying to process what he has just done. What was going through Ralston's mind at that point in real life? The brain as an organ assessing how to cope with a body part suddenly non-existent on its radar? Ralston retained enough peace of mind to apply a tourniquet before the cutting got too deep, retained enough sanity to take one last picture of his cut-off arm; had enough strength to then rappel down a cliff face and walk in the direction of his car before coming across hikers and being rescued.Astonishingly, Ralston retained consciousness through his rescue and hardly even had to be helped walking; a testament to the human body's resilience, that's how fit and/or adrenalized he was. Ralston made it because he was in peak human condition from his extreme sports escapades. It's got nothing to do with his ""soul"" or fighting spirit or that stupid ""premonition"" of his future son.From Ralston's book, Between a Rock and a Hard Place, 127 HOURS is pure visceral emotion. It will leave you spent, if you haven't fainted first. The film's coda shows us the real Aron Ralston with wife Jessica - sitting in the sun, relaxed, quiet. A welcome relief from the foregoing intensity. Ralston continues to climb and trek; we see a prosthetic climbing apparatus attached to his missing limb.Still, the most incredible, inspirational thing I took from Ralston was how he kept his three-day growth as a three-day growth over five days. If I could do that, I would be soooo sexy.",127 Hours
90,pyrocitor,"""Oops.""",10,31 January 2011,"A film involving its protagonist being stuck in a stationary, claustrophobic environment for the majority of its running time would hardly seem a likely candidate for one of the most kinetic and vibrant films of the year, yet the fact that 127 Hours masters such a contradiction proves testament to the nearly peerless abilities of director Danny Boyle. Working with yet another unorthodox premise, Boyle adapts the episode of Aron Ralston's unforgettable canyoning accident and captivity, and somehow, skirting potential obstacles with subject matter (how to work such a visually stagnant premise cinematically) and audience controversy (early reports of hospitalizations in reaction to the unflinchingly graphic climax) to emerge with yet another unexpectedly triumphant and inspiring cinematic triumph.What is truly impressive is the sense of Boyle contemplating and discarding every potential attempt to work shortcuts with his subject matter, allowing himself to cut away from Ralston's rock-bound captivity with flashbacks and hallucinogenic interludes, but only to a tasteful extent, mirroring Ralston's stream of consciousness while never shying away from the sheer numbing and eroding devastation of being trapped in a solitary, claustrophobic environment for such a duration (the film's title, rather than catchy and gratuitous, feels painfully well chosen upon retrospect). Similarly, Boyle adamantly refuses to bank on the film's two main 'set pieces' - Ralston's being trapped by the rock, and eventually freeing himself - structurally or cinematically (despite a gleeful poke at expectations as Ralston scrabbles for, but neglects to bring, his swiss army knife on his expedition). Rather than Ralston's being trapped being subjected to the expected, clichéd, slow motion, horrified hush, Boyle delivers it as an offhand, abrupt surprise, Ralston himself seemingly taking minutes to make sense of his predicament. In this vein, there remains an emphasis on immediacy and authenticity of experience throughout, before, during and after Ralston's entrapment, with minuscule, throwaway details such as Ralston's methodical laying the contents of his backpack in front of him to best strategize an escape proving just as poignant as anticipated scenes of screaming and sobbing. However, the true shock is, for a picture with such an ominous reputation, just how ultimately rewarding and frequently enjoyable a watch Boyle's film is, capturing moments of humour (sometimes uncomfortable, sometimes side-splitting) throughout and, in spite of itself, gearing up for an enormously inspiring and uplifting finale. While any other director would likely have succumbed to the temptation of drinking in the gruesomeness of Ralston's escape like a horror movie, Boyle instead frames it within a context of such engrossing introspection, contemplation and decisive stoicism that the graphic footage itself feels, rather than a disturbing money shot, almost besides the point, a mere means to an end in a buildup of overpowering affirmation and propulsion. As wrenching, gruesome and entirely consuming as the film is, the viewer is far more likely to leave the cinema feeling destroyed but cathartically cleansed as traumatized. Similarly, for a film involving extreme claustrophobia, Boyle's film dances with freedom and levity technically, as DP Anthony Dod Mantle's cameras careen around with wild abandon, exploding out of Ralston's tight space to exquisite, expansive extreme wide-angles of the surrounding canyon before plunging back in, and composer A.R. Rahman's musical score bubbles and flits with verve and more solemn reflection. If there is any fault to be found in the film, it lies in Boyle's arguable overstatement of the film's key message, that Ralston finds his predicament ultimately attributable only to his own cockiness and carelessness (the film's explosive beginning captures Ralston in a hyperactive split-screen, juxtaposing him against footage of crowds as if taking excessive pains to stress the alienation soon to come), but even this proves largely excusable if only for the sake of quieting potential banal complaints reducing the film to gratuitous violence. To say that James Franco's performance is career defining would be an understatement, as he wrestles the difficulties of carrying an entire picture while also in a stationary environment with staggering, understated ease. Franco musters such incredible energy in the early sequences of his bustling about like an over-caffeinated surfer that to watch his slow transition into hysterics, self-reevaluation and stubborn resourcefulness proves all the more crushing yet endearingly powerful as result (a sequence of Ralston grilling himself in the style of a talk show interview as to the culpability of his accident epitomizes Franco's incredible gift for charisma, comedy and understated drama simultaneously). While far too naturalistic and un-showy to warrant many (very deserving) award chances, suffice to say that Franco's performance deserves any quantity of accolades and praise.Fuelled by incredible energy, power, and sheer wrenching emotional impact, Boyle's 127 Hours proves a work of staggering innovation and genius whether taken as character study or circumstantial thematic meditation. Horrifying yet deeply uplifting in a single breath and bursting with consummate technical and dramatic skill, Boyle's latest proves yet another unforgettable masterpiece of realism and cinematic dazzle, worth undertaking for all capable of sidestepping squeamishness - the triumphant result is well worth it.-9.5/10",127 Hours

A story of human will to survive and severe sacrifices, 127 hours has a lot of potential to tell an extraordinary story.In many points, it achieves this potential in keeping you cautious and giving you an impression how grave it must be to be caught in the middle of such a hopeless scenario. Unfortunately I feel like it gives up on some further potential because the overall tone could be a bit darker. By presenting large shots of the outer valley or detailed descriptions of the main characters dreams, the producers pull you out of this otherwise desperate situation. But exactly this situation is what makes this movie so strong. I would have wished for an attempt to keep you caught there, maybe not referring to his inner state of mind as much as his bare physical presence to really give you an impression of how all hope slowly gets lost in this spot.That would have made the movie terrible in matters of physical pressure, but isn't that what it is in the end: A terrible situation?

""127 Hours"" records the time from when Aron finds himself stranded and trapped alone in a canyon, and has to use everything that he is mentally and physically capable of to try and get himself free.I found it very similar to ""Touching the Void"" (2003) and ""Into the Wild"" (2007). Here, Danny Boyle captures the Utah desert in all its glory (and its few fauna and flora), James Franco in his many stages of anguish and loneliness, and his extreme adventurous nature, complete with lots of loud techno music.Franco is expected to be in the running for the Best Actor Oscar, but I'm still trying to figure out how Emile Hirsch didn't receive the nomination for the aforementioned ""Into the Wild"". I think Boyle wanted to make this more of a bold adventure film rather than a soulful drama, so there were moments with quick, flashy editing and pumping music, and occasions for drug-like hallucinations. That's what depreciated the value of ""127 Hours"" for me, but it is still a spectacular story of the human will.",127 Hours

95,vitaleralphlouis,Danny Boyle Strikes Out,2,4 December 2010,"127 HOURS starts out badly and never recovers. All we know about this guy Ralston is he's racing a bicycle across Utah trying to get somewhere or other 45 minutes quicker than anyone before. Suddenly for no reason he's on foot, still racing, and meeting two girls. He loses sight of his goals and sets about impressing the girls involving them in irresponsible behavior jumping around the sharp and dangerous rocks of Moab, Utah.Soon after leaving the girls, he's still jumping around like a jerk when the ground gives way; he slides, and his forearm is stuck under a very heavy rock. He makes a courageous and focused effort to free himself, but eventually (as you know) he'll cut off the arm to save his life. (These scenes are no more graphic than necessary.) We are supposed to get to know Ralston through his many flashbacks. Unfortunately, his life was apparently no more interesting than that of a cigar store wooden Indian -- not much there.We're initially given nothing to make us care about Ralston, later we learn nothing much, and by movie's end he's still a blank slate.Danny Boyle uses a few cheap tricks such as turning the volume up seriously loud on the background music when something (supposedly) interesting happens. In truth this is pure ""What do I do next syndrome"" following his truly excellent ""Slumdog Millionaire."" In Slumdog, he grabbed our emotions over-and-over with one brilliant scene after another. Herein, nothing.I saw this film under perfect conditions at my childhood neighborhood theater, now the restored AFI SILVER, one of America's finest movie houses.

97,KnightsofNi11,A visceral experience like no other,9,20 November 2010,"You might remember from 2003 the story of a hiker named Aron Ralston. He made the mainstream media cycle telling about his triumphant story of being trapped under a boulder for 5 days (127 hours) and escaping by amputating his own arm. 127 Hours is the telling of this story, and I feel like the only more intense way to experience the events of this film would be by being Aron Ralston himself. It is one of the most visceral and intense experiences I've ever witnessed to this kind of prolonged extent on screen. Before going on this hike, Ralston told nobody where he was going, and so when he got his arm trapped under that boulder, he knew there was hardly any way out. He suffered through increasingly gruesome things to keep himself alive, all leading up to the grisly amputation of his own arm, which is shown in its horrendous entirety in the movie, not holding back at all. However, it is a fair trade since he escaped the inescapable with his life, and continues to hike and mountain climb today. The story of Aron Ralston is miraculous and inspiring, and 127 Hours does it justice ten times over.Only the first ten to fifteen minutes of the film have Aron safe and untrapped, and the movies title doesn't even appear until after being trapped by the boulder. Needless to say, the majority of the film is just Aron Ralston, and thank God he is played by the incredibly talented James Franco. Franco's performance is one of the best I've seen in a long time because of just how demanding it is. Few actors can carry a film by themselves, but Franco does an amazing job all alone at the bottom of a crevice. The dialouge is limited save for a couple of scenes, but Franco never lets up in his performance and does so much with so little, which is really the biggest triumph of the film in its entirety. That being its ability to do so much with such limited resources. And so much of that credit goes to a brilliant lead actor whose ability soars above and beyond any solo role of this sort in a long time.James Franco can't get all the credit though. A film that takes place with one man at the bottom of a two foot wide crevice has to retain life, energy, and variety, and with a director like Danny Boyle, it does just that. Boyle is a master of the sharp edits and quick cuts, and he puts this talent to full use for 127 Hours. He has to, or else this film would have deteriorated quickly into something very tiring and boring. But Boyle's fresh visual flair keeps the film extremely lively the whole way through, and one scene after another drew me in closer and closer. I was never bored by this film, and I never felt like I wanted it to hurry up and get to the point. Every scene has a point. It's an engaging character study of Aron Ralston, while also being a piece of art. Boyle employs such unique artistic technique into this film, making it a mixture of beautiful, gruesome, disturbing, and visceral. Boyle is a master at editing. Every shot and every cut of this movie is so well timed and so perfectly illustrated to make a never ending work of art that sends you through a frenzy of heightened emotion.Boyle also perfects his visual experience with excellent music selection. A. R. Rahman, the composer of Boyle's last film Slumdog Millionaire, returned to compose this film as well. Obviously the music is completely different from Slumdog but it is very fitting and makes the experience that much more intense. What we hear is aligned so perfectly with what we see on screen, giving the film an air of expert craftsmanship, as well as an innovative and original piece of art.There is so much more to this film beyond the incredible survival story we are treated to, and thats what makes it a visceral experience like no other. Everything is put together so well and not a single shred of artistic excellence is missing. I could not ask for more from a film like this that is something just so emotionally enveloping that I know I won't be able to get my mind off of it for days. It is definitely one of the best of the year so far. The only things that I think could top it that haven't come out yet are Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan, set to release December 3rd, or the Coen brothers remake of True Grit, coming December 25th. But until then, and even long afterwords, see 127 Hours, just be prepared.",127 Hours
98,agmoldham,Another Danny Boyle masterpiece?,5,12 January 2011,"127 Hours is Danny Boyles follow up to the huge commercial and critical success of Slumdog Millionaire.I normally like to see a movie without knowing too much details about the plot and especially the ending. 127 Hours is based on a true story of Aron who gets trapped in a cave after a rock falls on his arm and becomes lodged. Although not familiar with the story I had heard details about what happened which did spoil my enjoyment of the film. I will not repeat the ending for those people that don't know, but i suspect the majority of movie goers will know what's coming.Whilst trapped Aron creates a video diary of what he expect to be his last few days of life. During this time he has flash backs and dreams of his life. I couldn't help thinking that this could have been more interesting.James Franco is obviously the large focus of the film and he does a pretty good job as Aron. With the exception of the opening and closing credit sequence Danny Boyle is also good although I don't think it ever reaches the heights of Slumdog.",127 Hours

100,ajs-10,Inspiring stuff from Danny Boyle...,9,3 April 2011,"I know it's April already and this film came out in the UK in January, but after a very long wait it has finally landed at my local cinema! Since I've waited such a long time to see it there was no way I was going to miss it! I even dragged a friend along who doesn't often see this sort of thing. I'll give you my thoughts after this very brief summary (summary haters, and those that don't wish to know about the plot, please try to shift that rock while I write the next paragraph).Aron Ralston is an adventurer, mountain climber, he's most at home with all outdoor types of activities. He feels he doesn't have to rely on anyone else and has cut himself off from his friends and family to concentrate on the things he likes to do. Little does he know this is going to cost him dear. He goes out canyoneering alone near Moab, Utah but doesn't take his mobile phone (or cell phone if you prefer) with him and doesn't tell anyone where he's going. There he meets two girls, Kristi and Megan and they have a bit of fun jumping into a pool below a crack in the rocks. Eventually they go their separate ways and Aron heads off alone again. Taking a route seldom used he causes a rock fall that leaves him trapped, pinned by the arm with a large boulder. He is there for 127 hours before he uses desperate measures to free himself. During this time he reflects on the mistakes he's made in his life, making a video diary he thinks will be his legacy. I'll leave it there so as not to upset the squeamish Spoiler Police.I thought this was a very well made film with several devices used to keep the audience interested. Split screens, flashbacks, dream sequences all keep the thing moving along nicely. I have to say it's an outstanding performance from James Franco as Aron Ralston, he really nailed it! Honourable mentions also go to Kate Mara as Kristi and Amber Tamblyn as Megan.I love the visual style used by Danny Boyle in this one. It could have been a tough gritty drama like the 2003 Kevin Macdonald film Touching the Void, (also a very fine film by the way) but I found it was a lot more than that. It will make you cringe, it will make you laugh, and it will even make some of you cry, but I found it very engaging and very enthralling (even though I knew what the final outcome was) Definitely recommended.PS My friend thought it was good but a bit padded out with all that hallucinating & stuff (His words, not mine).My Score: 8.6/10",127 Hours
101,itamarscomix,Stylish,6,7 November 2011,"Once again, Danny Boyle shows that he has quite a lot of style. His talent for creating memorable images, powerful compositions and suspenseful, energetic shots is stronger on 127 Hours than it was on any of his films since Trainspotting. Cinematically, 127 Hours is a very solid piece, beautifully shot and edited, and complimented by a marvelous performance from Franco.And yet, at the same time, Boyle also shows just how incompetent he is at constructing a coherent and well-paced film. The chaos that worked for Trainspotting did not work well on any of his other works, and it fails here too. The biggest problem 127 has is that it begins and ends at the middle. We get no character development, no structure, no build-up, no satisfying ending - we're expected to get into the action right away, and just as quickly the film ends seconds after the climax. For that reason 127 feels more like a music video than a film. It has no real characters; the few flashbacks the protagonist has seem like a pretty lame cover-up for that fact, giving him a background and a family as generic as possible.It's pretty shocking, in fact, that a story this dark and shocking can eventually feel so light on film. Despite the grimness of the whole situation, it feels like a lighter version of Into the Wild. Which is why, as powerful as the film is while you're watching it, it leaves absolutely no lasting impression - which is criminal for a story like this. It's probably a good thing that it's short then, because it's just long enough to enjoy the visuals and Franco's acting, to be mildly shocked the way you would be at a news broadcast, and then to move on with your life.",127 Hours

103,jpschapira,Honest inspiration,8,28 February 2011,"""If I believethere's more than this"", sings Dido, that forgotten British lady who gave us great hits and beautiful songs such as ""White Flag"" and ""Here With me"". She always had a lovely voice, but these words she's singing in the name of Aron Ralston, the man who got his hand caught in a huge rock while climbing in the John Blue Canyon in Utah. We know who Aron is in a heartbeat; that is, James Franco defines the character in a couple of scenes. This he does not by speaking, but by actions: singing freely, running wild. Aron meets two girls and they sense he could be from another galaxy. He cares about nothing, he has not another person in mind and what he needs and loves is in front of him: big mountains.That's also what Danny Boyle needs. The mountains and James Franco are sufficient elements to make a whole movie. On the other hand, I think that by now we can agree that Boyle (alongside writer Simon Beaufoy) loves to inspire these days. That's what ""Slumdog Millonaire"" was and what ""127 hours"" is: inspiring (and inspired –I might say this a lot, but it's true-) filmmaking. If the previous film was about impossible love and rising above the circumstances to achieve the impossible, this new tale is the same thing, without the ""love"" factor. That is the factor that allowed Boyle to tell ""Slumdog"" as a fable, with hopeful music, bright colors and beautiful little things (or moments) in the ugliest places. For those who thought this was an erroneous decision, disrespectful towards a country's reality, ""127 hours"" arrives to prove them wrong.There's no embellishment here. No other color than James Franco's pale face and the red blood that comes out of his trapped arm. As real as a man who struggles for his life, with no water and food, begging for some sunlight and the response of a raven, the tale –while never losing track of its tragic center, that Boyle and the master Anthony Dod Mantle try to represent through various 'desperate' shots, like Aron's tongue seen from the inside of a bottle of water and other camera and mise-en-scene resolutions- takes flight through imagination.In Aron's situation, in which he tries to rise above the impossible as he thinks about who he is and what he's done in life (painfully- ""every moment since the day I was born has brought me to this rock"", he whispers-), imagination can be nothing but poetic (it's hard to accept it, but poetry in cinema –visual, narrative poetry- can be boring, really boring –not always-. Boyle makes it inspiring. I started with that statement so I'll try to get back to it). Aron searches for moments in the past, he envisions people in the dark and meticulously reconstructs a near future. Poetic means inexistent piano melodies in the air, or a beautiful woman saying an ""I love you"" that no one can hear. Some of the things he experiences are otherworldly.The most recent movies about characters alone with the world were Sean Penn's ""Into the wild"" and Rodrigo Cortes' ""Buried"". The first movie is about a boy who has lived a lie and decides to find truth in standing alone in front of Mother Earth. His personal story has affected him, and before he's completely by himself, he changes (willingly or not; it doesn't matter, it just happens) the lives of the people he meets. Chris (or Alexander Supertramp) has an ideology and talks a lot about it, but it's not the most consistent element of the movie. In ""Buried"", ideology is everything, powered by a great original idea. A man is trapped in a coffin, underground, and as he tries to survive (there are some good 'survival' sequences), every line of dialogue is spoken to criticize the government. There's no personal story whatsoever, only daggers thrown at the policies towards hostages in foreign land.Let's recapitulate, because I want to get to the transparent inspiration that lies in the story of ""127 Hours"". In ""Into the wild"", Supertramp ends up alone in Alaska by personal choice. You can be inspired by several reasons that can be found in the journey of the film (a road trip in the end), even more if you believe in the character's ideas. In ""Buried"", the main character is captured on purpose. You can be inspired if you support his political ideas, his will to get out of that coffin or his family waiting at home? There's not real inspiration there.In ""127 Hours"", however, Aron being trapped is not planned (this is all the more surprising), but as he goes back on who he is, at some point he even believes it was not an accident. It's that idea what's inspiring. Aron spends 127 hours revising these thoughts. He rediscovers himself as a person and we get to know him as a man who wants to overcome the impossible. What's even more purely inspiring, besides the fact that Boyle fractures the screen and races through the scenery in order to make this introspective journey more exciting (as only himself can); besides the fact that the director has found in A.R Rahman the perfect partner to tell stories that cannot live without music (now without HIS music); and besides the fact that James Franco takes on the role as if it was his own life on the screen; is that unlike a lot of these kinds of movies, Aron does what he does not to prove a point, or to set an example, or because he stands for something. He does it for himself because he wants to. In those hours, he somehow realizes he has to do it. Wellthat's when nothing can stop you.",127 Hours

It's an exhilarating film right from the outset, and as soon as we're stuck with Aron the film starts pushing limits and ideas with incredible pizazz. James Franco makes arguably this year's best performance, his shared thoughts, pleasures and fears goes through a wallop as he dreams about being flooded out of his situation, or reminiscing his former girlfriend or family memories. 127 Hours is a thrilling adventure that becomes a touching story, and as the rousing climax comes it feels beautifully.",127 Hours
106,jdkraus,It's hard to do a great film about one man's survival,7,3 July 2012,"The story of Aron Ralston is as incredible as is foolish. Aron is a lover of canyon climbing and the outdoors. Back in 2003, on one of his trips to the Utah canyons, he got stuck when a boulder fell on his arm. He was immobile for 127 hours until he made a bold decision of cutting off his arm. He never informed anyone where he was going much less brought a phone. We cannot entirely blame Aron for this—bad things happen to people, especially when alone in the mountainous wilderness.This film by British filmmaker Danny Boyle goes in-depth with this remarkable yet ludicrous true story. James Franco plays Aron as a happy-go-lucky, charismatic guy. Even in peril, he knows how to make the audience laugh, cry, and even move them. This performance is definitely Franco's crown jewel and his Oscar nomination was well earned. The style of story and filmmaking is perfect for Mr. Boyle. The use of choppy editing, jump cuts, overexposed lighting, time lapses, and occasional bursts of loud sound effects and music is reminiscent of his past works. It fits well for this kind of movie. The majority of the film takes place in the canyon where Aron is trapped. To keep it going, hallucinations and flashbacks are added as Aron struggles to survive. This works for a while but after an hour it becomes dull. No doubt it is hard to do a movie about one man's survival—look no further than Tom Hanks in ""Cast Away."" The problem with these kinds of films is that it goes on longer than necessary and incoherent flashbacks are used as an excuse to add sympathy for the character. I am not saying ""127 Hours"" is a bad movie. It is a decent one. But for 94 minutes, it drags on like a three-hour film. This may have been intentional to emphasis the seemingly endless time that Aron suffers. But when I start to see subliminal cuts of Scooby Doo and Gatorade commercials, I have reached my limit.""127 Hours"" is not a movie for everyone. The big critics love it and the mindless masses find it distasteful. In my opinion, it is neither. It is good, but not great. I will forewarn that the amputation scene is one of the goriest moments I have ever seen in cinema—and I sat through ""The Passion of the Christ"". This is definitely not for the faint of heart.",127 Hours

108,Likes_Ninjas90,Boyle's direction is fearless,8,19 January 2011,"This is based on the true story of how mountain climber Aron Ralston (James Franco) was travelling across the canyons of Utah and had his arm trapped under a boulder. After being stuck for five days Ralston used little more than a blunt knife to cut off his arm and escape. This film examines the ordeal as closely as possible, commencing with a montage of Ralston's rapid lifestyle, to when he meets two female hikers and then his drop into the canyon. From this point the film immerses the audience into Ralston's space, rapidly visualising many of his thoughts and his emotions. He remembers his family most fondly and a sense of regret is one of the major fragments of Ralston's personality that emerges from his nightmare. One of the most surprising thrillers of last year was Buried, a minor thriller set entirely inside a wooden coffin. It was an effective exercise in claustrophobia that relied heavily on coincidences. Danny Boyle's 127 Hours, adapted from Ralston's own book ""Between a rock and a Hard place"", is similar in being set almost entirely in one location, with almost a single actor too. Its ambitions are however undeniably more sophisticated. Boyle has been periodically interested in the velocity of the lives of young men. And he uses that as a basis for an intriguing question: how will someone so regularly mobile cope physically and emotionally by no longer being in control of their body? He attempts to answer this through a deliberately hyper-kinetic visual style. At the beginning the thumping beats of music combine with rapid cutting and split screens to project an image of Ralston's lifestyle. He's the sort of guy thrilled to have his heart beating out of his chest. His energy is infectious to others too though. His introduction to two hikers briefly suggests that he has enough charm to still connect with people when he wants to. After some cave diving one of the girls he meets says playfully: ""I don't think we figured into his day"". This is merely the surface of Ralston though as Boyle is intent on taking the audience deeper into the adventurers emotions. Boyle's direction, through some unconventional camera-work by Slumdog cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, is fearless. He gives us point-of- view shots from inside a water bottle so that we can see Ralston's tongue licking out the final drops from inside. He cuts to an imagining of a plentiful Gatorade container and to an extreme close-up of Ralston's face under a cloth. I have rarely warmed to this hyper brand of filmmaking as its long been used by action directors to substitute narrative for momentum. There's more feeling to Boyle's work though: he succeeds in making us feel the limitations and the desperation of this space. He achieves the realisation that every bit of water, every dropped tool and each catch of sunlight is crucial for survival. It's a credit to Boyle and Franco that the film pulls off most of its gambles. There's a lighter scene where Ralston verbally interviews himself, like on a talk show, complete with canned laughter. It's a surprisingly funny moment but Franco's internalisation of his longing and regret is particularly notable. Ironically, the film's most touching moment is also it's most restrained. Franco is given the appropriate amount of time and space to bring genuine sincerity to Ralston as he speaks into a video camera, apologising to his parents. I found that to be the film at its most poignant. Inevitably, there are some missteps with this unorthodox brand of storytelling. The flashbacks to the family are mostly touching but they also veer dangerously close to sentimentality too. There's a slightly cringing moments where Aron remembers his sister playing the piano with him and he hazily says under his rock: ""Way-to-go sis"". There's also the strange recurrence of a child that is certainly not Aron's and not himself but perhaps an imagining of his own future son. Most crucial though is the absentee of the aftermath. We learn that Ralston married after three years and continued with his sports but surely there were darker and more isolating aftershocks to come. Not even the fearless Danny Boyle can take us there.",127 Hours

110,anselmdaniel,Tense claustrophobic thriller,7,15 August 2020,"This review contains spoilers.127 Hours is a movie directed by Danny Boyle and stars James Franco. The movie is about a hiker that becomes trapped for 127 hours and must come to terms with his predicament. The movie examines his life and how he had come to this situation. In particular it shows the character's regrets and his eventual resolution.The movie is a vehicle for James Franco's acting ability. The movie is entirely dependent on James Franco's acting range and for this the movie does well. There is not a scene that is weak because of James Franco. He is on the screen for almost the entire movie, and the movie is better because of it. He is able to portray a character literally stuck between a rock and a hard place incredibly well. I became a fan of James Franco and his acting has made me interested in his serious roles in the future.The movie's plot is bare bones. This is to be expected but the movie fills the full 90 minutes with flashbacks and hallucinations. These scenes felt superfluous to the predicament and only served to make the character come to terms with what he had to do. Without these scenes, the movie could have been 45 minutes long.Overall, I would recommend 127 Hours. It is a tense and claustrophobic look into a man stuck in a rough predicament.Grade: B",127 Hours
111,virek213,Survival In The Utah Badlands,9,3 December 2010,"True-life survival stories often make for compelling films, but it would seem after the idea of ""survivalist"" was appropriated by the highly rated CBS-TV ""reality"" show Survivor that this particular genre had run its course. As any discerning person will attest to, however, Survivor and other like-minded TV shows are really merely game shows or contests roughened up for the participants. Such a fact can be borne out by the artistic success of a film like director Danny Boyle's 127 HOURS, one of the best films of 2010, though it has caused some consternation among film goers for the very method of survival it depicts.The film is based on the experiences of Colorado-born adventurer Aron Ralston (portrayed by James Franco), who had gone out on a cross-country hike in the badlands of southern Utah in late April 2003. He hiked into isolated Bluejohn Canyon some thirty miles outside the Utah town of Moab and, while repelling down a cliff into the bottom of a canyon, dislodged a sizable rock and then slipped. The rock wedged his right arm between it and the wall of the canyon, and he remained stuck there for 127 hours, or just over five days in all. Braving temperatures that ranged from the lower 90s during the day to below 50 degrees at night, he had to be careful how he used his water, and he documented his story and his personal musings on his camcorder, trying very hard to dislodge the rock that was keeping him in place by chipping away at it with a rather cheap made-in-China pocket knife. It only seemed to prolong the agony, because the rock was never dislodged. With very little time left, and his water supply running dangerously low, he was forced to do the unthinkable with that very same knife.Although Boyle, known for such films as TRAINSPOTTING, SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE, and the grisly 2002 zombie flick 28 DAYS LATER, makes the same mistake his fellow British director Tony Scott has done on his films via the use of an occasionally loud industrial-type rock score by A.R. Rahman and sometimes jerky camera movements, he mostly sticks to the facts surrounding Ralston's life and ordeal. As portrayed quite well by Franco, Ralston comes off as a fairly cocky young man with a penchant for extreme adventure who found out how high a price can be paid for forgetting what it can often take to survive such an adventure. The film bears a significant similarity to ALIVE, the 1993 film in which where the participants of that true-life ordeal (the 1972 Andean plane crash saga) were forced to survive their ordeal in one of the worst ways possible, in that case by resorting to cannibalism. Here, of course, Ralston, totally alone, cut off from the outside world in an isolated chasm where few people would have ever dared to go by themselves, had no other choice but to do what he did, which meant losing the lower half of his right arm in the process.Although it is understandable that the scene in question would leave a lot of people extremely queasy, this is every bit as unavoidable an aspect of the story as was the cannibalism in ALIVE, even though it takes up three to five minutes near the film's climax. Boyle can sometimes be accused of going too far with the viscera in his other films; and the scene is still quite shocking, even when compared to the opening twenty minutes of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. Still, thanks in large part to the way Franco portrays the change in Ralston's behavior from happy-go-lucky adventurer to a survivor almost reduced to nothing, 127 HOURS is a compelling film, especially given the fact that Boyle decided to film it in the very locations in Utah where Franco's saga took place. Besides being a compelling, if somewhat uneasy, film, it shows us how precious life is, and not to take it for granted, as the real-life Aron Ralston did with nearly fatal results.",127 Hours
112,DonFishies,An emotional and unforgettable experience,9,21 November 2010,"Despite having the opportunity to see Darren Aronofsky's absolutely extraordinary masterpiece Black Swan at this year's past Toronto International Film Festival, I did regret missing out on Danny Boyle's 127 Hours. The film was one of the few to emerge from the festival with momentous Oscar buzz, and even a bit of controversy over a specific scene late in the film that was causing people to faint in theatres.The film chronicles the true story of Aron Ralston (James Franco), a recklessly arrogant mountain climber whose arm gets crushed under a boulder during a trip through Utah canyon country. With no one coming to save him, he must decide whether he will die or fight for survival.The logline and description may not sound like much, but 127 Hours delivers one of the most riveting and incredibly emotional experiences I have had in a theatre in some time. I was unsure Boyle and his crew could top their Oscar-winning work in Slumdog Millionaire, but this film improves upon it in every way possible. Because of all the talk about ""the scene"", the majority of people will know how the film ends well before they even consider seeing it. But everything leading up to Aron's life-altering decision is absolutely amazing and the stuff of pure filmmaking magic.From the very beginning up until the very end, you know you are in the hands of some truly special filmmakers, specifically Boyle. Everything in the film seems to have a pulse and a life of its own, whether it is the hyper kinetic editing, the lush and gorgeous cinematography, the often epic score, the thought-provoking writing or just the general style of the film. Where other movies pay very little attention to the little things, Boyle and company seem to have amped up the quality in the majority of those areas, and made a film whose elements very much complement each other. I could not believe the short running time at first, but they pack so much in and the film moves at such an aggressively energetic pace, that you barely have time to slow down and breathe once the film really gets moving.One of the unique things that really stood out for me was the use of flashback throughout the film. Ralston spends a lot of time thinking about what brought him to this life changing moment, and it is rather interesting how Boyle handles these thoughts. They act specifically as our way into Ralston's life and his character dynamic, but they never seem to overtake the bigger picture of his being pinned by the rock. They work rather brilliantly as asides, as mere stylishly and crazily edited set pieces (a naked party in the back of an SUV is a particular standout). They are among the film's few scenes of character interaction, and help the audience adjust deeper and deeper into Ralston's mindset. It aids the film in being an even greater experience of authenticity. His hallucinations are done in very much the same way, but do not work nearly as great as these off-the-wall scenes do.The lengthy cast list may not suggest it, but the film is really just the James Franco show. We only get fleeting and stylishly edited glimpses of him at first, but after the boulder comes down, the film becomes a deeply focused, claustrophobic and devastatingly candid character piece driven almost exclusively by facial movements and reactions. 2010 has been a year of transformations by actors, and Franco's turn as Ralston is no different. The camera gets right in his face and shows us the gritty reality of his predicament, and Franco is eerily authentic in his portrayal. You can see the gradual exhaustion and desperation taking its toll on him; you can see the visible fear on his face as he faces life or death. Not many actors are able to drive a film by mainly interacting with themselves and the static objects around them, but Franco delivers in spades at every turn. Whether he is being devastatingly hilarious or dead serious, he still manages to ensure the realism and intensity of his performance never changes. You will be unable to take your eyes off this riveting portrayal at any time.While it pains me to have to point out the film's small amount of imperfections (even with the attention to detail), it is only because I cannot wrap my head around the film being absolutely flawless. This is an incredible piece of cinema, but there are a few special effects, musical and editing choices made that are simply baffling. I understand the point and logistical ideas around some of them, but some just stand out as odd. Why point out the insects that inhabit Ralston's surroundings, and then make them so CGI'ed that they look visibly fake? Why throw in the out of place tunes to help try and convey his emotions? I know I am pulling at strings, but there were at least a handful of elements that seemed out of place and made the film slightly less than perfect. It just seems these extra steps easily could have been made to make the film even more pristine.127 Hours is not just a film – it is an experience. It is only in limited release now, but I can only hope that audiences everywhere will get the opportunity to see the movie. It is an amazing movie centred around an absolutely incredible, legendary performance. Watching Franco bare his soul on-screen is practically a cleansing experience. I went in with high hopes, and left with a huge smile on my face. It is authentically emotional, and in a year merely punctuated with a handful of amazing movies amongst a sea of filth, it more than just stands out.

I came in expecting a simple tale of survival, but instead I found myself completely entranced by the story telling. Great visuals help to put you there in between the crevice walls and really make you experience the toll of the situation. Boyle even manages to achieve many moments of surrealism within it all. Imagine the terrifying and dark premise, and yet there are nicely done moments of comedy that fit in quite nicely. Of course, a large part of the film's effectiveness is the casting of James Franco. Words can't describe how awesome he was from start to finish. As an added bonus, it's one of those rare treats that for the most part lives up to its true-story basis. I highly recommend the film.",127 Hours
114,griffolyon12,An Absorbing Tale of Perseverance!,10,9 February 2011,"127 Hours is a simple movie. There is only one real prominent character, for the most part one location, and one major action that takes up nearly the entire movie, so how does this movie remain a riveting experience? A perfect collaboration between actor, director, and writers.Danny Boyle directs the true story of mountain climber Aron Ralston who gets his arm pinned beneath a boulder and ultimately resolves to cut his arm off to survive and find help. Boyle, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Simon Beaufoy, pumps his kinetic visual style throughout the entire movie, using split-screen to marvelous effect to show Ralston's fast-paced, ADD lifestyle. I mean, no one other than Boyle would take shots inside Ralston's arm, or inside Ralston's water bottle. Not only that, Boyle manages to keep this movie from being simply about the situation of being trapped beneath a boulder by including video messages that Aron makes on his digital camera to his friends and family, in case anyone ever finds it, but where the movie really finds its heart and its message is when Aron starts slipping in-and-out of consciousness and blurs his dreams, memories, and reality, all into one.Actor James Franco plays Ralston as a self-absorbed man, who finds pathos in the end realizing he can't do it all on his own. The greatest thing about Franco's performance, is it feels real, it actually looks and sounds as if he is in the same pain that Ralston most likely was in this situation. Franco holds nothing back and it is primarily because of his reaction that makes the scene where he actually cuts through his arm so tense, not to mention the precise editing and building music by A.R. Rahman.If there is one thing that 127 Hours is about is the perseverance of the human soul to continue living, even in the most extreme circumstances, and to find that this near death experience only humbles Ralston and makes him a changed man makes the movie all the more affecting and uplifting.I give 127 Hours a 10 out of 10!",127 Hours
115,WriterDave,Harrowing True Life Tale of Survival,8,20 November 2010,"Academy-Award winning director Danny Boyle has always been a fan of survival stories. With this reality based tale about Aron Ralston getting literally trapped between a rock and a hard place on a mountain climbing trip in Utah gone horribly wrong, Boyle has finally found a near perfect story to match his over-the-top directorial style.Apart from the head jarring opening minutes, most of Boyle's usual tricks work very well here. It also helps that James Franco willingly goes gonzo in the lead role. There's real emotion and a zest for life on display...and as gut churning as the end result is...you'll be hard-pressed not to feel uplifted.Check out full reviews and more at theschleicherspin.com",127 Hours
116,Eumenides_0,"Intelligent, Original, Audacious, Emotional Feel Good Movie of the Year",10,27 February 2011,"In a year populated with mediocre inspiring true stories like The King's Speech and The Fighter, Danny Boyle and screenwriter Simon Beaufoy give a crash course on how to film a true story with heart which lifts up our spirits, with bloody graphic details and audacity and without manipulative sentimentality. 127 Hours is a perfect movie from the opening shot to the final note of the song 'Festival' by Sigur Ros which concludes it.Aaron Ralston (James Franco) gets away from the city for a weekend to explore the canyon in Utah. He has food, water and utensils. He's a cocky expert, he's done this before many times. So many times he even acts as a guide to two girls lost in the canyon, Kristi and Megan (Kata Mara and Amber Tamblyn respectively). He knows shortcuts and cool places to visit. He's so sure of himself he doesn't even bother to inform friends or family of where he's going.Then he falls in a crevice and a boulder falls on his arm, trapping him meters below the surface in the middle of a lunar landscape barely visited by human beings. The movie chronicles his five days trapped there and his agonising escape, which involved cutting his arm with a blunt knife, climbing down a rock and walking until a family of explorers found him almost dead.So why is this predictable movie worth watching? Simple. No one makes movies like Danny Boyle, especially when he co-writes the screenplay with Simon Beaufoy, one of the finest screenwriters in the business (The Full Monty, Slumdog Millionaire).Boyle's detractors say he has an MTV style, but for me he's audacious and original in the way he plays with the camera and tries to find strange angles to shoot from. And strange angles abound in this movie. Who else would think of filming from inside Aaron's canteen to show his last drops of water entering his mouth? Who'd shoot from inside a arm to show a knife actually hitting a bone? Who would put a counter in the screen's corner showing the temperature in the cave dropping at night to show the conditions Aaron endured? And when Aaron gets trapped, who'd film, with wicked irony, an airplane flying very, very far, leaving a white trail in the air? Boyle is a madman, bless him! The camera madness starts right from the start, when the screen splits in three. This is a technique Boyle uses a lot in the movie, but the most effective use is the opening sequence. As the movie shows us Aaron preparing himself to leave his comfy apartment the split screen bombards us with images of crowds, brand names like McDonalds, traffic jams, neon lights. In one word: civilisation – everything Aaron is leaving behind. And when Aaron arrives at the canyon the cluttered split screen gives way to wide panoramic shots of dreary landscape. The contrast is amazing! Boyle continues to prove that he's a master of visual storytelling.The movie also boasts a career-defining performance by James Franco. Franco's performance crackles with joie de vivre, enthusiasm and cheerfulness. Sure we can think, Aaron is an idiot for going out there all alone without telling anyone, he's cocky as hell. But Franco gives Aaron such a humane personality that we can't help loving him.Aaron's time trapped under the boulder allows him to rethink his life. Although perseverance is an important theme in the movie, the real emotional power comes from Aaron recognising, almost too late in his life, his selfishness and the way he treats his family and friends, and realising that wanting to do everything alone got him in there. The most heartbreaking scene comes when he imagines himself in a talk show and chastises himself for not relying on people more often.But, amidst Aaron's growth, this movie puts forth a beautiful story about the power of hope. Not since The Pianist has cinema given erected such a monument to the triumph of the human spirit. The Pianist is a difficult movie, harrowing in depicting the atrocities of the Holocaust. The protagonist, the pianist Spizlman, superbly played by Adrien Brody, faces each new day of hiding in the Jewish ghetto as a challenge. Although we can't compare Aaron's experience to his, they find common ground in their refusal to give up, in their determination to live. 127 Hours starts with the song 'Never Hear Surf Music Again,' which says 'there must be some chemical that makes us different from animals.' This can only be another grim irony by Boyle. Consider. Foxes bite their own legs off to free themselves from traps. Aaron cuts his arm off. Survival prevails over everything else. Life is beautiful but it has a price that, most of us going through our ordinary lives, ignore until we meet extraordinary circumstances.Aaron's self-amputation scene is graphic and long, but the viewers who can stomach it will be rewarded with the most sublime ending of the year. 127 Hours is the feel good of the year, a movie so emotionally draining that the ending isn't just an historical fact but a psychological necessity for the viewer desperate for closure. It's a movie that intimately and tenderly pushes us towards the protagonist. Aaron's liberation isn't just the ending of a true story, Boyle and Beaufoy make this conclusion our deepest desire. If Aaron Ralston had died, they would have had to rewrite history because no ending short of Aaron freeing himself would satisfy the viewer who grows to love him, to laugh and cry with him. And there will be tears. Tears of despair and tears of joy, especially of joy. Anyone can film a true story, but not everyone can make the viewer anxiously wait for an ending everyone already knows in advance. Danny Boyle can.",127 Hours
117,LoneWolfAndCub,An intense and emotional experience; draining yet very uplifting,9,8 February 2011,"Once again Danny Boyle has created a cinematic treasure. Much like Slumdog Millionaire, Trainspotting and 28 Days Later; 127 Hours is such a fantastic experience, despite the incredibly heavy subject matter. From the beginning to the end 127 Hours had me glued to the screen, leaving me speechless and incredibly emotional. What made this even more powerful was the ever-present theme of the importance of human contact, which was never made to be sentimental, but which was a gentle reminder of the significance of family, friends and partners.Boyle took on a big challenge when he chose to make a film based mostly in a canyon with a man whose arm is trapped under a rock. It was never an easy task, as it is an action movie with no action in the typical sense. However, Boyle uses his creativity, which can be found in many of his previous films, to keep his audience captivated and thoroughly engaged in the proceedings. Showing us views from all different angles (even from inside water bottles and tubings) in order to enhance the horrible situation and make it seem more ""in your face."" For instance, we see inside the tubing of the water backpack a couple of times, which may seem pointless, but when we see it as he is drinking his urine from it it becomes much more visceral and gut-wrenching. During the many flashbacks and hallucinations that Aron Ralston (James Franco) experiences Boyle utilises his hyper-kinetic editing style to show his delusional state of mind, although sometimes it can be slightly overdone.Another reason this movie is so good is a result of James Franco's outstanding performance. A whole range of emotions are re-enacted with such realism and grittiness it is hard not to be blown away. He is just a tour-de-force...his pain seems real, his psychological breakdown scary and his dark humour uncomfortably funny. Franco is rightly being recognised for his job, and if he gets the Oscar I will not be surprised or disappointed.A.R. Rahman once again collaborates with Boyle to produce a stunning soundtrack never seems out of place, perfectly accompanying the dramatic scenes and the horrific amputation scene. Yes, the scene is shocking, brutal, and graphic, but is not the reason to see this movie. It is the events leading up to it, and the reasons behind it which truly make this movie worth seeing. Boyle has managed to turn a tale of survival, courage and hope into a very un-American, uncliched story. It is not an epic tale with a thrilling climax, it is an honest story of one man's will to live once he realises what he has to live for. It may not be totally uplifting, but its message is nonetheless important.127 Hours is not for everyone, but I would recommend it to anyone and everyone I could. It is hard to watch at times, but it is so well made on all fronts (be it directing, writing, acting, or scoring) that it is easily one of the best films of 2010.4½/5",127 Hours
118,ronakkotian,"Intense, stylish and personal",8,29 November 2020,"Danny Boyle has been consistently giving us amazing films like Trainspotting, Slumdog Millionaire and Steve Jobs. Once again, Boyle succeeds with 127 Hours.127 Hours is the true story of a man named Aron Ralston who gets trapped under a boulder whilst canyoneering near Utah.Danny Boyle once again makes a fantastic film that managed to keep me on edge the entire time. What I really loved about 127 Hours was how personal it felt. We're with Ralston for the whole movie and so I felt a connection with him as he went on this expedition. The cinematography was absolutely gorgeous. The shakyness and close ups whilst Ralston was under the boulder created a claustrophobic and intense feeling that left me on edge till the end. Boyle is a stylish director and brought a lot of style to the film with some of the shots and the use of flashbacks and hallucinations. I wish Boyle held back a bit with his style as it would have made the film feel more raw and gritty but at the same time it actually brought me closer into the mind of Aron Ralston. It helped create a personal connection between him and the audience as we got an understanding of his perspective of the situation.James Franco is truly outstanding here. This film is a one man show and so there is a lot of weight he has to carry but he does really well. I wholeheartedly believed the pain and struggle he was going through especially during the climax which is certainly not for the faint hearted. The editing was sharp, clocking in at 95 minutes, but some of the techniques like the split screen got a bit repetitive after a while.Despite that, 127 Hours is another triumph for Danny Boyle. The film was engaging and tense throughout and James Franco delivered a knockout performance.",127 Hours
119,braddugg,I am surprised that I did not yet write a review of this film that is true honest and uncompromising.,8,20 September 2014,"I am surprised that I did not yet write a review of this film that is true honest and uncompromising.It's a bore, un engaging, we saw this many times, yeah he is triumphant but we lost our time. These were the words I heard most from those who saw it coz that's not what it is for me.It is one of the honest stories I have seen all through last year and even as I saw it now, I could not hold myself from scratching my cheeks hard when the amputation scene came. It's one of the best voyages undertook and our hero Aron has not actually won it but he had to lose something to win life. And that something is priceless.Aron is an adventurer who frequently ventures into the national parks of UTAH(that's one state of USA I missed last visit and in fact the state that has most national parks.) UTAH is known for it's very Red Indian life style, it's very lively people. But here, most of the movie is shot in canyon, the whole movie is shot in landscapes and specifically only one cliff in the Blue John Canyon.The way it is shot is so very thrilling that I got everything for minuscule to a macro, just by camera movement. The camera is everywhere, coz we get to know of the tape moving in the video recorder and the drops sprinkling inside the water bottle. Man, the camera work is a lesson to learn and will let us know how to make a simple movie interesting with such great work. Also, the shot has to be placed perfectly placed so I credit the editor for this for he had a very sharp scissor.Major Credit must be given to James Franco who played the role of the real life star Aron Ralston. The scene in which Aron reaches for the sun light when he is stuck is so terrific and the emotions are so very well portrayed. I can see the pain and the joy at once.Now, this is one of the very best Blu-rays I have and it's because all the landscapes, the slot canyons, the water jumps, the background music are made so terrific by two things. 1) Cinematography 2) Audiography. Now, Danny Boyle who perceived this film and made it with conviction has to be praised for bringing out a triumphant story and triumph is actually what we crave for in every story we watch. If the whole of the movie did anything, it just touched me and moved me. Thank you Danny for bringing to light a story worth telling yet again to screen. Thank you very much.It's 4/5 for a movie that's a must watch without a pause or a break.",127 Hours

But the strength of 127 HOURS is more than just the sum of its severed parts: director Danny Boyle makes you share the appalling isolation in Aron's predicament, and James Franco's performance, slowly cracking up as the hours and days crawl by, makes you yearn for the crisis to have a different resolution.Boyle fills the painful hours with flashbacks to Aron's family life (and girlfriend moments) and fantasy forward flashes to the life he doesn't expect to see again. There are a few scenes which have almost certainly been added to spice up the waiting time(e.g. the water-baby games with two girl hikers and the near-Biblical flood) and Aron's videocam episodes verge on the mawkish (justifiably perhaps), but even without them this thrilling and beautifully photographed movie would pack a powerful punch.Faced with a lose-lose situation like Aron's, how many of us would have the courage to do what he did?",127 Hours

123,CinematicInceptions,Surprisingly entertaining and less gory than you'd think.,8,15 July 2015,"Had this movie not been based on a real event, I would have said that it was trying to make a name for itself by being something that we'd ""never seen before"". This wasn't because it was shot with any absolutely mind-blowing camera work or anything like that, though it does have a very distinct style. The story/situation is really quite something though. It's probably fairly true to the event since we can assume that the real Aron videoed himself at least a little and wrote a book about the experience to boot.So the basic premise is that a mountain biker, Aron Ralston, gets his right arm trapped under a boulder in the wilderness. The story mostly hinges on his failed attempts to get out from under the rock and how he mentally reacts to his plight. It's nice that we're with Aron every step (or lack thereof) of the way. He runs into some practical issues, namely lack of food and water, dropping his knife, and the elephant in the desert of being stuck in the middle of nowhere with no way of contacting anyone. He also goes through some mental/emotional progression with his flashbacks and hallucinations. You can usually tell when he's hallucinating, but some of it still might be a little disturbing. The times when Aron is more sentimental are a little striking because he has a, I don't want to call it a facade but something like that, of lightness and humor. He can even be sentimental while he's being goofy, like in his self-interview. Even if he's kind of eccentric, we can sort of relate to him, and besides that his situation is deserving of some kind of sympathy. The only other people he comes in contact with the whole movie are the two other hikers, Kristen and Meagan. Both of them are written well in that they feel realistic and give Aron hope for when he's stuck under the rock. The other characters are only shown in flashback, which I guess means they aren't really characters.The camera-work and cinematography are unique, not necessarily better or worse. There's a lot of split screen, mostly at the beginning. The execution of Aron cutting his arm off was uncompromising in it's portrayal. The directing and acting, which basically all comes from James Franco, were pretty good, arguably great. WARNING: If you consider yourself squeamish or anything like that, you may want to skip the rest of the paragraph. There is a fair amount of blood, not unrealistic, but still copious. The operation buzz sound effects when he tries to cut his nerve off were a perfect compliment, even if it makes you feel a little gross. The entire decapitation takes a little over a minute, but the pain shown is personal enough to make you uncomfortable for a little while.On the whole, it's pretty inspiring in a way similar to the Shawshank Redemption since you've seen the protagonist go through so much and hopefully you're really excited for them to be free. It's relatively impressive filmmaking, though there is a little shaky camera-work for the go-pro style biking sequences. If you're averse to watching it because of the arm amputation scene, just close your eyes for the 80 seconds and enjoy the rest. I recommend seeing it through, but if you get really annoyed with Aron after about half an hour, it probably won't be enjoyable for you. Overall Rating: 8.3/10.",127 Hours
124,ClaytonDavis,"Franco is the star, not the film",6,5 December 2010,"Danny Boyle blazed on to the awards circuit two years ago with his Best Picture winner ""Slumdog Millionaire."" Boyle took no prisoners tearing through the awards season taking gold after gold. There was lots of anticipation for his follow up film ""127 Hours,"" based on the true story of Aron Ralston, a young man who gets his arm caught under a boulder in Utah. The premise and promise made it sound like a sure-fire winner. Unfortunately, the films falters and falls a bit flat in execution. Boyle walks a fine line between artistic choices and cinematic overkill; he crosses the line a time or two. What saves the film is the undeniable remarkable work of James Franco. This is the best solo principal casted work since Tom Hanks in ""Cast Away"" back in 2000. What Franco achieves here is an uplifting of the human spirit and an utter submerge into a character of epic proportions.Though Danny Boyle's direction and Simon Beaufoy's script are not the brightest things the two has placed on the screen, the story itself is worth the admiration and enough to place itself on this year's ""must-see"" list.***/***",127 Hours

126,Ali_John_Catterall,I am a Rock,9,6 April 2011,"A few years ago, while boarding the tube, I missed my footing and fell down the gap between the platform and the train. Just in time, I managed to hook my elbows onto the carriage floor, while performing the can-can from the waist down. I knew I had only seconds before the unthinkable happened... and then a young French tourist with a big red rucksack hauled me inside.The point being: at no stage did I feel like I was in a Danny Boyle movie. Time steadfastly refused to hyperventilate, while reality in general resolutely failed to fracture into a series of dizzying hyperkinetic edits. No banging tunes. If I'm honest, it was just really, really embarrassing.But 127 Hours is most decidedly a Boyle picture: if being trapped underneath a rock for nearly a week must feel a trifle monotonous, you wouldn't guess it from his take on Aron Ralston's memoirs. Comparisons with Touching the Void are inevitable – Aron's mishap even occurred the year Kevin Macdonald's film was released. Yet unlike 'Void, this is a weird sort of premise for an action film, in which the subject is Standing Still more often than Running and Jumping (or Crawling and Swearing). You can't blame the director, then, for wanting to jolly things along with those funny little tics of his.Ralston, played with immense conviction by James Franco, is the devil-may-care mountaineer who made headlines in 2003 after falling through a crevice and getting pinned against a canyon wall by a dislodged boulder – truly, a destiny with density. Some might call that unlucky. Or, like the delirious Ralston, firmly believe that ""From the minute I was born, every breath has been leading me to this crack in the surface of the Earth. This rock has been waiting for me all my life."" At this stage, it probably wouldn't have been useful to point out to him that life is essentially meaningless, a bunch of random events inviting any number of feeble interpretations, and thus ultimately a bad joke played on those foolish enough to ascribe innate structure or pattern to it. That probably wouldn't have helped. All the same, we can at least entertain the notion that any and all such events present opportunities for random acts of senseless kindness – or courage. As re-enacted in the film's skilfully-edited money shot, Ralston's sole stab at survival means rendering himself deficit to the sum of one right arm. (This reviewer's screening was at 9.30 in the morning, perhaps not the best time to catch a horribly authentic self-amputation. Then again, when would that optimum hour be?) The film is bookended by images of vast crowds – in triplicate; the screen splitting three ways to accommodate the great churn of humanity, from whom reckless Ralston will deliberately extricate himself – and then, in the way of Boyle movies from Trainspotting to The Beach, desperately attempt to rejoin.There's also cackling irony in the fact that while Ralston's trapped, the screen fair teems with other people, via memories of his family, past girlfriends – even premonitory visions of a future son. If you were wondering how fellow cast members slotted into such a solitary story, they're all down there in Blue John Canyon, in James Franco's bonce. Yet strangely, he never seems so alone as during those first few moments following his extrication. Baptised in blood and sweat, he is transformed into a spirit as mighty, as elemental, but just as isolated, as that vast ancient canyon. That boulder didn't just happen to Ralston; he faced the old bastard on equal terms. And gave it the finger.",127 Hours
127,moviemanMA,Push it to the limit,9,19 November 2010,"In 127 Hours, we follow Ralston, played by James Franco, a person who lives life to the fullest and on his terms. His lifestyle pushes others away, but for him that's okay, a choice that will haunt him. While taking a weekend trip to Blue John Canyon, Ralston finds himself in the precarious situation of having his arm wedged under a boulder. With limited supplies, Ralston must find the best way out of this mess, all the while ensuring his survival. With some rope, tethers, a cheap multi-tool, and headlamp, he goes through trial after trial of attempting to free his arm.Entering the film, I was curious as to the techniques Boyle would employ to keep us invested. After all, watching a guy under a rock for five days sounds like an Andy Warhol film. I was expecting to see cutaways to people who would be looking for him. We soon find out that no one knows he is there. Then I realized that Boyle's angle is to put us in that canyon trapped under the very same boulder. Our only advantage over Ralston is that we can move freely in our seats pain free, though we go through each event be it drinking water, urinating, stretching for sunlight, or doing the unthinkable of removing one's limb.By putting us in the canyon, our minds start to race, much like Ralston. His only escape is through his camcorder with which he documents his time, and with his endless parade of thoughts and memories, both good and bad. Imagine having that much time by yourself and the flood of memories and emotions that would creep into your head. It's mind boggling and borderline disorienting to think about. Through Franco's performance we see how this forced isolation influences ones thoughts so much.Franco, much like the boulder on top of his arm, is rock solid throughout the film. The opening sequences show his free spirited nature and inability to stay on the ground let alone in one place. He whizzes around the canyon, confident with every step and every peddle of his bicycle. Once trapped in the canyon, he is confined to staying put, something his character is not used to. Franco was so convincing that I forgot about the character and focused on my own emotions. He did many of the things I saw myself doing with the same expressions. As the film progresses we feel every emotion and sense every sensation.To help with this process, Boyle employs creative camera shots, sound effects, and editing techniques. Due to the cramped space, Boyle puts the camera in virtually every crevice and height imaginable, including shots from inside his water bottle and even one inside his arm. Each movement is accompanied by a slew of sounds that intensify and bombard our senses. One in particular utilizes an electric guitar buzz when Ralston attempts at severing a nerve. Cut all of this with editing straight from a Jason Bourne film and you have an intense, dramatic sequence of events that keeps the audience engaged.On an estimated budget of around 18 million dollars, Boyle utilizes his leading actor, Franco, his beautiful locations in Utah, and an incredible arsenal of editing points, coverage shots, and foley artistry to create a portrait of a lone man pushed to the edge. Like so many of Boyle's characters, they are presented with an obstacle, be it a zombie onslaught or a game show, and we are able to see how the choices they make both in the present situation and in their prior experiences influence and determine their ultimate outcome.Ralston is confronted with the idea of his entire life's journey has led him to this rock at this time and in this place, leading to the conclusion that everything happens for a reason. As for Boyle, we're all thankful for the path he has chosen.",127 Hours
128,david-meldrum,"Thrilling, Vibrant, Visceral, Challenging",9,12 November 2021,"The best decision Danny Boyle took with this film was embracing the idea that Aron Ralston - in the film at least - is not a pleasant person with whom to spend time. As a result the film shares some DNA with Seinfeld, the show where nothing happens and it was an article of faith that the characters never learned anything. The plot here is minimal and whilst Ralston's journey through the 127 hours is portrayed vividly and painfully, there is no epiphany, no great moment of clarity. By the film's end, the most the movie's on-screen text can say is that he always leaves a note to say where he's going these days.Clearly, this is an event that would have changed Ralston to some degree, but that's not the film's focus. Boyle is one of the most urbanised of film directors, and that's on full display even here, a film that spends most of its time in the wilderness. The blistering opening to the film, not to mention many of Ralston's fantasies and hallucinations, emphasises this urban character, a man from the city - and hence heighten his isolation. It all means that we enter into his plight more fully and viscerally - this become a film about empathy. We don't have to especially like Ralston to feel what he's going through emotionally, physically and spiritually. The concern is not so much if he is changed as if we are - do we allow this to transform our understanding of empathy? We don't have to like someone to empathise with them; we 'simply' need to enter into their pain alongside them, which this film forces us to do.Franco's performance is good enough but this is a film belonging squarely to Boyle - and his editor, cinematographer, sound designer and composer and music co-ordinator. Vibrant, challenging, thrilling and engaging, it's a film that surprises as much as it haunts the viewer afterwards - and challenges us to consider exactly whom we're willing and able to feel empathy for.",127 Hours

130,rooee,Feels more like 27 minutes...,4,6 January 2011,"Danny Boyle is committing GBH on the frame more than ever these days. It works in 127 Hours initially – during the opening cross country scenes, with the ironic camera swooping across the landscape not to find some undiscovered wonder, but Aron Ralston (James Franco). As Ralston approaches the gorge that will become his living tomb, the editing ratchets further, and the tension mounts. Yet it never STOPS ratcheting. Even as Ralston's poignant premonitions begin, of the son he may never have, Boyle is intent on pummelling our senses with colour and sound, never allowing us to settle into the lonely mundanity; the grey, endless dread. We're left with a breezy comic book descent into an unconvincing hell.The decision to depict Ralston as smug and vacuous is admirable, although given that he now commands an eye-watering honorarium for motivational speeches in real life, it would seem that this is a character rainbow at whose end has not been found the Church of Humility.Perhaps there is an underlying commentary on these narcissistic times here: the notion that Ralston may have taken the final, gory step towards survival out of a semi-conscious desire for celebrity. Even his heartfelt message to his folks (probably the film's best scene) is performed as a brash American talk show. Boyle and co-writer Simon Beaufoy, with their premonitory promises of a selfless paternal utopia, do their best to (ostensibly) scupper this suggestion; but the smell still lingers, not least because they've, well, made a film about the guy. There's a self-fulfilling irony here that's hard to comprehend.The film serves as companion piece to Slumdog Millionaire, insofar as Boyle bleeds a heart-warming story from the bleakest of backdrops, building the narrative from grizzly horror, through drippy sentimentality, to orgasmic frenzy. The tonal shifts in 127 Hours might be slightly less jarring than the former film, but the aftertaste is no less tooth-rotting.On the occasions the editing settles we glimpse a fine performance from Franco, although less varied and witty than Ryan Reynolds' in Rodrigo Cortes's Buried. Come to think of it, Cortes's film summons more excitement, humour and pathos from the confines of a single box than 127 Hours can muster with all its gimmicks.",127 Hours
131,scottshak_111,A great tale of adventure and misfortune portrayed in an excellent way,8,26 February 2011,"Another great movie by Danny Boyle. Albeit the story is inspired by a true story and you had a ready made story in your lap, Danny Boyle did a great job manifesting the same in his own style.The movie is about a guy named Aron Ralston (James Franco) who sets out on an adventure in the canyon of Utah. He finds himself in trouble as he gets stuck under a rock which accidentally gets tipped off as he lands on it, on his right hand. He finds himself stuck with the rock and has only a few things left with him to survive. The story is about how he actually survives the peculiar situation he has been put in. It is an adventurous tale of survival of Aron which is impeccably directed by Danny Boyle(who else could have portrayed this story better!).There are only a few characters in the movie but that was because the script demanded it. James Franco performed really well and surely has landed himself for an Academy nomination on this one. The direction and the screenplay probably took the movie to a great height what otherwise would have been a clichéd story of survival.The poster and the movie name had a lot to say and at one point I had considered not watching the flick but I was totally surprised when I found the flick totally mind boggling. It is highly recommended to go for this one coz it is actually a real good movie.",127 Hours
132,coreyjdenford,There is not enough stars for this.,8,21 November 2014,This film based on true story was filmed Danny Boyle the guy who gave us Trainspotting and 28 Days Later. James Franco plays Aron Ralston who is a climber and takes place between 26th April-1st May 2003. This film is literally exhilarating and tear jerking this film literally made me cry and it is one of the most amazing films I have ever seen in about 4 years.The story of this film is just outstanding and matches the genre very well the acting from James Franco is perfect why did he not win best actor for this role that he played just really well.We know that Danny Boyle makes very films 28 Days Later being one of my favorites because he makes great stories and is just wonderful with a camera.I recommend this film to anyone because it is just wonderful deserves all the Oscars it was nominated for.,127 Hours
133,dvc5159,A reminder of why the human spirit triumphs over all,8,26 February 2011,"If there were any force of nature that is more powerful that anything else in the world, perhaps even in the universe, it is the human spirit - and its will to survive. In Danny Boyle's ""127 Hours"", Aron Ralston becomes the embodiment of the human spirit, and we are captivated and we cheer for him, both towards the film and to the real person as well. Here is a man that is full of courage and determination to did what he had to do to survive, and that is a triumph in itself.In the film, Ralston is played by James Franco. He is the core of the entire movie, with the entire movie focused on him; not only does he physically fit the real Ralston well, he also delivers a terrific performance, that is really physically and mentally draining, both for him to deliver and for us to watch. This is Franco's best film thus far. Take for example the scenes where he interviews himself. It may be comic relief but Franco displays every emotional shade that really showcases his true, raw talent as an actor, and also engages the audience in a thrill ride, even though the film isn't an action film.But it doesn't need to be an action film. Danny Boyle, fresh from his Oscar win for ""Slumdog Millionaire"", utilizes his same kinetic and energetic direction in every shot so that Franco's vivid portrayal can shine through with the same energy as a lightning bolt, and the film's pace not feel boring throughout. The editing by Jon Harris is pitch perfect; it is vibrant without being forceful, and it is inventive with its cutting, especially during the split-screen scenes, but in some parts it gets quite distracting. Boyle employs two cinematographers for this film: his usual one Anthony Dod Mantle, and Enrique Chediak. Both make full use of the camera as they both shoot sweeping scenery of the American desert and canyons at the beginning, and then when Ralston is trapped they think of every possible angle they can place their camera on to give a sense of extreme claustrophobia and realism. The home-video feel adds more to the experience and makes the film feel as real as possible. Also from ""Slumdog"", acclaimed Indian composer A. R. Rahman returns to give an ambient and quite somber score that suits the situations perfectly.The way Boyle depicts Ralston's excruciating ordeal is raw and almost documentary-like. It's not too dark and brooding and full of hopelessness, nor is it handled in a clumsily light-hearted manner (NO ONE in their right mind will try to craft this film in the latter way). Boyle knows what he's doing. So is Franco. The way the young actor screams, the expressions he shows when he is distraught and desperate, the way the camera focuses on his face somberly as if it was his doom, it is excruciating to watch but at the same time no one can pry their eyes off the screen. At the climax of the film there is a very graphic and disturbing scene that will make the squeamish turn away, but I say it adds greatly to the film's harrowing effect.In my opinion this film deserves every single accolade it has received. This film is not only an inspiring tale that is well-crafted and extremely well-acted, it's in many ways a testament to the human spirit and it's undying determination to survive. In this world some of us may be cast aside and left unnoticed as the world keeps spinning, but let this movie be reminded that there is still hope, and it comes in strange, and sometimes unpleasant ways. Bravo to Mr. Boyle, Mr. Franco, and the crew of the film, and very especially Mr. Ralston for such a tremendous accomplishment.Another reason why Hollywood still has some juice in it.Overall rating: 89/100",127 Hours
134,gary-444,An Honourable Failure,5,11 January 2011,"I am a huge fan of Director Danny Boyle's work, but this time around he tried something different, and didn't quite succeed. Tackling a story which centres on a largely motionless man deep in a ravine is a big challenge, and is not one which he successfully overcomes. Lead actor James Franco as Aron Ralston does well enough but there is not an awful lot to go on.Based on a true story the film opens up with shots of him as an adrenaline junkie, mountain biking in the Utah desert and canyoneering, long distance running across it. Curiously, in real life he was an able graduate in Mechanical Engineering and French, although that intelligence is never revealed to counter some fairly reckless behaviour.The scenery is fantastic, and the opening act when he chances upon two girls and leads them part of the way is Boyle at his best, playful, pacey and eventful, if a little unlikely. But inevitably once Ralston is trapped, the dramatic options are a bit limited. To his credit, Boyle eschews ""faction"" scenes of encounters with cougars, snakes, near misses by passing helicopters and half heard voices of walkers – but in fact that does not leave much. We have a storm scene whose dramatic and cinematic potential is underplayed, and then the inevitable self-mutilation.Flash backs pre-dominate and hallucinations unfold, but we never really know enough about Ralston to really care. Then when he does escape from the boulder, a demanding 20m descent is dealt with in a perfunctory manner, he stumbles across some walkers, a helicopter arrives – and that is it. No denouement, no context. It all feels a little unsatisfactory, a bit like the Billboard Poster which is an invention and depicts no physical part of the film.The music is also poor. Discordant and jarring, it's use as a high octane accompaniment to the biking works, but otherwise it does not work well to try to crank up some artificial excitement. The self-amputation is gruesome and graphically depicted in all of Boyle's gory glory, but that isn't enough in a running time which at 94 minutes feels simultaneously long, and incomplete.",127 Hours
135,PeterRoeder,Is this a joke????,4,19 September 2011,I bought this on DVD for around 12 dollars today and looked forward to seeing it. Imagine my surprise. This movie is just crap. A sort of parody on Touching the Void which is the real thing. There is really nothing in this movie. The actor looks like he is perfectly on top of the situation no matter what happens. At one point we just lose interest. It must have been horrible to be stuck in the cinema with this one. It is so boring. I recommend Touching the Void instead which is a really great movie and story and book about a great subject that is quite similar to this but far more interesting and realistic. To be quite honest I really lost interest in 127 hours and is now writing the review while the movie is playing in the background. I just realized that I really did not care what happened. There is just no suspense at all. It is a terrible movie. Not only is it bad it is also incredibly boring and a complete waste of time.,127 Hours
136,Meven_Stoffat,It really shouldn't work,10,15 February 2011,"Really. The true story of Aron Ralson who went on an adventure in the Grand Canyon and spent 127 Hours in a crack trying to get out after a large boulder traps his arm between the boulder and a wall of the crack. He nearly goes insane and after 127 hours, cuts his arm off to escape.From the sounds of it, it shouldn't work as a movie. There's no way a one man show with a man stuck in a crack being the focus of a whole movie can translate well.But the shocking thing is, it does work. And surprisingly very well.After his stellar Slumdog Millionaire, Danny Boyle gives us this look into the mind of Aron Ralston. This movie has an interesting film style- with all the shots from inside his water bag, the split screens, the satirical talk show scene, etc.James Franco is amazing in this flick. James Franco isn't James Franco in this movie... he really IS Aron Ralston. His emotions, facial expressions, mannerisms, etc. It was entirely believable, and he really is one-man show material. He manages to anchor the movie and make the one-man show entertaining.""The Scene"" apparently caused some faintings, and really, I don't know why. It isn't really that graphic. I've seen many worse scenes, and it's not even that gory/bloody. It is, however, incredibly intense and hard to watch, and Franco really makes it believable.Overall, 127 Hours is an incredible movie, truly Oscar material. Although not my first choice for Best Picture It manages to be very entertaining, and will completely defy all of your expectations.Oh, Danny Boyle, you magnificent bastard... how do you do it?",127 Hours
137,Eternality,I applaud Boyle for taking the road less travelled.,8,10 February 2011,"**Warning: Huge spoilers ahead as I will write about the film's ending.With a plot this minimalistic, one could forgive director Danny Boyle if he had made a ten-minute short instead of a ninety-minute feature length film about a guy who went hitchhiking and got his right arm crushed in between a rock wall and a huge boulder deep in a crevice of a remote canyon. Based on an incredible true story, 127 Hours is a visual recount of the ordeal an immobile Aron Ralston went through for five daysbefore he decided to cut off his entire arm with a cheap penknife and escape to freedom.James Franco plays Ralston in a mostly one-man show that exhibits wit, self-depreciating humor, determination, and the will to survive. To his credit, Franco manages to pull everything off quite remarkably despite being stuck in one spot for nearly the entire film. Much like Ryan Renolds in Buried (2010), a claustrophobic horror film about one man's predicament of being buried alive in a coffin, Franco's character earns our sympathy not because his situation is extremely dire, but because he is unlucky to land in such a predicament that is of no fault of his.He has a camcorder with him, and Boyle uses this device of his to design sequences that add much needed humor and the occasional (false) optimism to the film to positively weaken the seriousness of the film's subject matter. There is only a limited number of angles a director can choose to shoot such a film, but Boyle's trademark hyperkinetic visual style allows him to venture into areas that are uncommon even in mainstream cinema, let alone in films of this strange new sub-genre – for instance, the exaggerated psychology of the protagonist, and the visual-aural parallelization of certain actions in the climax of the film.Boyle explores the mental state of Ralston through sequences of dreams, nightmares, and premonitions – scenes that would be more at home in a fantasy or horror film, but surprisingly works well in a realist film like 127 Hours. Of course, the overwhelming use of such ""mentalistic"" material (and Boyle does indulge in one too many) makes the film more lively and engaging, but at the expense of emotional depth, which the film somewhat lacks. Yes, we feel Ralston's physical pain, and take pride at his eventual triumph, but the motivation of his to decide to cut his arm off is not as clearly fleshed out as it should.The film's editing creates visual energy with the use of multiple split- screens and quick cuts. And just as well, for I doubt anyone would take pleasure at seeing a long take of Ralston slowly slicing his arm off. Still, that amputation sequence is as graphic as it can get, so those with a weak heart would be advised to look away. Boyle reduces (or for some, increases) the intensity of the sequence through the visual-aural parallelization that I mentioned earlier. For example, he marries the breaking of the human bone to the sound of a gunshot (""bam!""), and the touching of a nerve to the sharp plucking of a string of an electric guitar (""twang!"").127 Hours, for better or worse, is unmistakably a Boyle film – energetic, rhythmic, and visually creative, but it also comes with its fair share of excess baggage that like a sponge absorbs much of the film's potential emotional power. I sincerely believe Boyle has taken the material as far as he possibly could, and I applaud him for taking the road less travelled. At the same time, I also wonder what could have been if Werner Herzog stumbled upon Ralston's story and made a powerful, provocative documentary instead.

138,Ryan_MYeah,"Boyle's auteurial stylistics may be a bit of a misfit, but James Franco delivers one of the VERY best performances of the year.",8,8 January 2011,"I recently saw 127 Hours, a rock (no pun intended) solid movie about the true story of Aron Ralston.In the film, James Franco plays Ralston, a thrill seeker whose arm became pinned between a boulder and a canyon wall while he was rock climbing in Utah. He became trapped for over five days, taking drastic measures to survive, before finally resorting to amputating his arm off, and eventually making it out alive. At this point, it's a cliché to say, but this is nothing short of a remarkable, and incredible true story.Some would accuse the film of being style over substance, I'd disagree, but I can see the point of their argument, but just hear me out. Danny Boyle is a remarkable director whose films usually include frenetic film editing, inventive camera techniques, and thumping music. Those traits work well in other films of his (like Slumdog Millionaire and 28 Days Later), but while they are clever, they tend to remove focus from the main plot line of THIS film. Unfortunate to say, but the editing and camera-work had a tendency of irritating me.Still, that's no reason AT ALL for me to call 127 Hours a BAD movie, especially not for the film's true driving force, James Franco. He carries the whole film on his back, and 99% of which is entirely on his own. His performance is intense and emotional, and never feels false, never feels preachy, and never lets us take our attention off the screen. One of the year's very, VERY best.And even if the aesthetics tended to get in the way, they can't bog down the passion behind forming the screenplay. Not only is it a successful story of survival, but it also ties in a theme of embracing, rather than shunning society. The sound mix is also sleek, and the pacing tends to hop between slow and fast, and I mean that in the best possible way, as it appropriately shows how the daily struggles of Aron's life either glides by, or drags along. It also features a beautiful end credits song by Dido and A.R. Rahman.If you can look past whatever flaws there are, you'll find A LOT to admire.I give 127 Hours *** out of ****",127 Hours

They deserve all the credit for making us go through 95mins of run-time so interestedly when the whole movie is confined to two rock walls and a single man.Situations like this can really be life-changing. It can turn your whole life around. It makes us realize how grateful we should be for the things we have. We usually realize it only when we lose it or are about to lose it. Even a drop of water or ray of sunshine seems priceless in situations like these. Though the situation was self-induced by the character Aron, he learns a lesson. In the end, he not only leaves his arm behind, but a part of him too.James Franco's transformation into this character is brilliant. James is eerily authentic in his portrayal. You can see the gradual exhaustion and desperation taking its toll on him; you can see the visible fear on his face as he faces life or death.The movie shows very nicely & uniquely how a mind can wander to different places at a time like this.",127 Hours

141,williampsamuel,Possibly James Franco's best movie yet,9,6 December 2014,"Danny Boyle's 127 Hours is the true story of hiker and climber Aron Ralston (James Franco), who spent five days pinned under a boulder at the bottom of a narrow canyon, cut off his arm with a pocket knife, and lived to tell the tale. As you might guess, it is extremely graphic, even disturbing. But even though Aron spends almost 90% of the movie under that boulder, it is never boring. The acting, direction, and editing are such that even when nothing is happening physically, there is something to watch.That sentence may not seem to make sense at first, so let me explain. Aron's may be trapped bodily, but not mentally, and where-ever his mind goes, we go. Every memory, every hallucination, every vision of what the rest of the world must be doing, we're there for. And through these flashes and snippets, we learn more than if we'd seen the entire previous week of his life. Plus, as in Castaway, he has something to talk to; in this case his camcorder. Trapped, with no hope of rescue and no reason to believe he'll live, he fully bares his soul to the camera, and by extension, us. His hope and determination, his fear and despair, his past regrets, his struggle to come to terms with his present circumstances, and his growing detachment from reality are all recorded for us to see. The imaginary call-in show near the end is a masterpiece in itself. And even in the sections with no dialogue, Franco's face expressions cue you in on what's happening inside. His mouth and eyes convey an incredible range of emotions and states of mind. Franco has shown himself to be a good actor in the Spider-man trilogy and the highly underrated The Great Raid, now he shows himself to be a great actor. Although I don't usually do so, I feel I would be amiss if I did not spend some time on the editing and cinematography. The camera work is absolutely amazing. The movie uses long pans, slow zoom outs, rapid tracking shots, and shaky first person footage to capture the beauty and harshness of the desert, give a sense of scale and distance, and lend an authentic, home movie type quality respectively. Frequent use of split screen footage allows us to see the Aron's predicament from every angle, and to simultaneously perceive the reality of the canyon and what's taking place in his mind. And through blurred shots and rapid montages we gain insight into his increasing delirium.The audio quality is exceptional as well. Whispered comments and the clinking off his knife against the rock are just loud enough to be clearly audible. The cracking of bones and Aron's screams for help are by contrast almost overpowering, and the crackling of thunder is ear-splitting. Which brings me to the special effects; there aren't many of them, but they're very good. The thunder I just mentioned signals the beginning of the best rainstorm I've seen in any film not by Kurosawa. I'm talking buckets upon buckets, a deluge of Biblical proportions. And I don't know how the makeup artists do it, but Franco absolutely looks like he has only one arm in the final segment. I don't know if there's anything more to be said. 127 Hours is not action packed by any stretch of the imagination. It is not romantic, it is not funny except for parts where you laugh so that you do not cry, and it is certainly not for the faint of heart. But it is moving, inspiring, and a truly great tale of one man's incredible will to survive.",127 Hours
142,geminiredblue,Between a Rock and a Hard Place,10,13 April 2011,"The first thing I have to mention, and I'm certainly not the first, is the incredible performance by James Franco. His role as Aron is gut-wrenching and charged with emotion. The various hallucinations and struggles he goes through more than convinced me that the real Aron went through the same torment. Which brings up a good question. What does it take for James Franco to get an Oscar? I asked the same thing of Mark Wahlberg in THE FIGHTER. I know there can only be one Best Actor, but WHAT. DOES. IT. TAKE? Both are talented, who infuse their roles with convincing emotions. When both actors are going through struggles, you feel it and cheer them on when they succeed. And both have played roles that are so natural and down-to-earth (with the exception of Max Payne in Wahlberg's case, but let's forgive him for that.) Second, the cinematography is astounding. Considering that most of the running time takes place with Aron trapped in the crevice, Danny Boyle and his team are at it again! Filming their scenes in dozens of new and creative ways. The best scenes I felt were the hallucinations. They were spot-on without feeling staged or fakey. There is one in particular that makes you think the movie's over, until you realize along with Aron that it's all a fantasy. Of late, I've been really impressed with Danny Boyle's work. TRAINSPOTTING was a force to be reckoned with, 28 DAYS LATER redefined the zombie genre, SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE was an inspiring journey into a part of India that we rarely see outside of Indian cinema, and now 127 HOURS has us diving into the world of extreme sports (along with the perils of living life on the edge.) I highly recommend this to anyone who wants an inspiring story, with a word of caution if you're squeamish about realistic gore effects.",127 Hours
143,Cedric_Catsuits,Irritating,2,30 August 2013,"I've seen this twice and the second time was just to confirm my initial thoughts. I thought maybe I missed something, seeing as it scores so highly here. Truth is, it just irritates me how somebody so stupid and reckless can be portrayed as some sort of hero. Boyle's freaky insights to Ralston's decaying mind only make matters worse. Had it been an out-and-out adventure film it might have worked better.I'm sure Ralston is not alone in being reckless - most adrenaline junkies are to some extent, which is why so many of them get killed or injured. However, anybody venturing alone into the wilderness needs a bit of common sense, which Ralston clearly lacks. He takes one small bottle of water and little else of use on a trip into a hot, dry, remote area, a journey which only he knows about. That is not reckless, it is just plain stupid.Within minutes of setting off on his bike he has an accident which could have left him seriously injured. Can't ride a bike, don't go careering across rough terrain. Then there is the drop into the pool, which I believe is not actually based on fact, but again illustrates how stupid he and the others were - one or more of them could easily have died.Somehow surviving all this, he then clambers down a shear rock face over loose boulders and debris, so it is not surprising it turns out bad. Frankly from then on it goes from bad to worse, a long drawn-out affair detailing the rather dull and senseless thoughts of a guy who clearly is a sandwich short of a picnic. I'd have been happy for him to get his head trapped by the boulder and have the film end there. Talk about drawing it out ... yawn.So really I fail to see what the point of this movie is. In parts it is nicely filmed and that saves it from scoring 1. There is no tension, no excitement, and surprisingly no real signs of a guy struggling to cling on to life, which I imagine is what one would be doing were one stupid enough to be trapped like this.Anybody reading anything more into this must be sadly lacking in real life experience. It's pretentious twaddle.",127 Hours

Set in April, 2003 – It follows adventurer Ralston (James Franco) as he hikes through a slot canyon.While climbing down it, he accidentally slips and falls. A boulder pins his arm against the canyon wall and he is stuck. His several attempts at removing the boulder and calling for help are to no avail. He begins recording a video diary on his camera (so as to keep a running dialogue with the audience) and rations his food and water.

No expectations, no hearabouts, and no reason: I sit down to watch. The premise sounded simple enough and real great, especially how the director gave us works like Slumdog Millionaire. When the movie started, it gave us a sneak peek of it's style. It's directing very beautifully: the cinematography, the shots; they all had up to the intensity. When the movie kicks off when the title appears, the crowd quiets down, the movie progresses terrifyingly, and we all sit to watch a truthful film. When you have a situation like this, you find everything to help you survive. Luckily, the director's intention was to make us FEEL as if we were the helpless. The cinematography helps, shots lingering on the facial expressions of fear, hopelessness, and delusion. No one has ever pictured this quite as such as Danny Boyle. Kudos. When the movie progresses onward, you can't help but think how can they make this more enjoyable? The movie goes run on 94 minutes, and showing a man struggling to survive isn't THAT enjoyable. Thankfully, the film shows crazy hallucinations, flashbacks, fears, wants, wills, and everything in between. And once again, the film shows us how we would show it, and it adds up to it's realistic ability. And for all this combined, lined: I loved 127 Hours. It was mystic, haunting, a little beautiful. I sound like I'm praising the film, and most likely I am. The film deserves attention and thankfully it does.

There's just not much of story here and watching 90 minutes of something so thin and predictable, just doesn't work. The movie Open Water came to mind. And that is not a good thing.4/10",127 Hours
149,the_wolf_imdb,I'm amazed: An intelligent hero at least!,9,8 August 2012,"The story of the movie is simple, the tempo is slow. A lot of visual poetry, only a few thrills. But the hero is really sympathetic: Even when he did make a mistake at the start, he fought for his life bravely and intelligently. That is very rare among the thrillers where the heroes make usually a train of errors, making bad situation worse.The movie is beautiful and powerful. The amazing landscape is worth seeing alone, the powerful story about human cunning and will to survive is absolutely great. The part of helping strangers in the end is also amazing and moving. Great movie! The only single error the hero made is at the very beginning when he fails to inform others about his trip. So remember: Always inform someone where are you going and where you are supposed to return. This very simple rule applies not only when you plan to take a hike in the mountains, but also when you go for a family shopping in the supermarket. Always have ""the fall-back plan"" where you are supposed to meet when things go wrong. It might help you a lot.",127 Hours
150,Michael Fargo,"An experience, near death",10,26 November 2010,"The biggest hurdle anyone would face in putting this material on the screen is how to make it cinematic. Danny Boyle takes hold of the static and gives it such visual verve, you might recoil and dismiss it as grandstanding. But considering the alternatives, almost without our noticing, Boyle infuses life and its need to preserve itself to a situation that couldn't be more lifeless: a man's near death pinned under a rock in a dark canyonfor four days.We waste no time in getting to the dilemma, and after a stirring Koyaanisqatsi open credit sequence, we're there pinned down, and the ""action"" begins. If you've ever seen any of the real footage Aron Ralston shot when he was actually trapped, it's impressive how Boyle recreates it but takes us inside the mind of a man who rationally looks at this situation and tries to keep hold of that matter-of-factness while slowly losing his mind. It's a superior feat by someone who is becoming one of our greatest directors (rather than simply a stylist), and the work James Franco contributes by transferring Ralston's epiphany and physical ordeal to the screen is equally amazing.Most anyone will know what happens before they see the film. But the emotional catharsis displayed here will surprise even the most cynical viewer.",127 Hours
151,ssvikas,Well made! Highly intense and at times disturbing!,8,1 February 2011,"Danny Boyle became a household name in India with 'Slumdog Millionarie'. As much as it attracted criticism for typecasting India, his skills at filmmaking accumulated accolades. Boyle teams up yet again with the Maestro, AR Rahman, screenwriter Simon Beaufoy and producer Christian Colson for '127 Hours'.Shot on location at Utah, it is based on true account by Aron Ralston in his book 'Between a Rock and Hard Place'. The film deal's with the protagonist's ordeal for more than 5 days after a fallen boulder crashed on his arm and trapped him in an isolated canyon. The lack of food and his dwindling water can made it worse. James Franco (Harry Osborne in 'Spiderman') plays Aron Ralston's part to perfection.The movie doesn't dwell on whether Ralston did or didn't do something right. Rather, it is his varying emotions that take the center-stage. Amidst the rocky hopelessness around him, he reminisces his family, draws recollects his last best moments with the passersby he had just met, his thirsty thoughts traveling to the half-filled drink bottle in his car, keeping his spirit alive and finally, garnering the courage to redeem himself.The biggest challenge in a solo film is zero opportunity for dialog. The writers make up for it by interspersing it with recollections, wishful thoughts and self recorded videos. That said '127 Hours' excels at dramatizing the events visually. Cutting between character's point of view and close up of the expressions and then putting in some detailed slow motion shots, the camera work is simply mind blowing. To its credit, its portrayal of events has a 'thumbs up' from the real- life Aron Ralston! But, turning what could have been a great documentary on TV into intense drama on the big-screen marks Danny Boyle's achievement. AR Rahman's ominous music contributes to intensifying the drama. And, its editing has drawn applause too. Goodies apart, '127 Hours' may not be suitable for all audiences. A certain scene (not discussed here) without which the story wouldn't have been complete could be termed 'gory'. But if you think you can stomach it, this flick is not to be missed!",127 Hours
152,ScottDMenzel,"""127 Hours"" is the most intense film to be released in recent years!",9,11 January 2011,"In ""127 Hours,"" James Franco plays Aron Ralston, an extreme sport enthusiast with a love for adventure. The film starts off with Ralston planning a huge trip through Canyonlands National Park in Utah. At the beginning of his journey, Aron meets up with Kristi and Megan, who are also looking for some adventure. Aron and the girls share a fun filled day together full of swimming and some hiking. By nightfall, Megan and Kristi part ways and invite Aron to come to a party a few days away. Aron says, he will see if he can make it and that's where the real adventure begins. Aron, now alone ventures deep into the Canyonlands where he falls into an isolated canyon only to find his arm trapped by a boulder. What happens for the next hour and 30 minutes is the remarkable true tale of one man doing anything he can to save himself. An intense film ensues...First and foremost, ""127 Hours"" is based on a true story of Aron Ralston. The film itself is based on his autobiography ""Between A Rock and Hard Place""and the story is nothing short of fascinating. As far as the movie goes, Danny Boyle really makes ""127 Hours,"" a unique and intensive movie going experience, which I give him a huge amount of credit for. As a film lover, I realize that a film about a guy stuck in a canyon for 93 minutes isn't an easy sell nor would many think it would make for an intense and exciting movie.Boyle using his directing and writing skills makes ""127 Hours"" probably one of the most intense films I have seen in years. I love how Boyle made the beginning of the film feel all upbeat and lighthearted. While I was watching this film with my fiancée it was funny because in the first five minutes of the film we looked at each other and said ""what is this?"" It seemed like a nice little film about this adventurous guy who meets up with two women and goes on adventures with them. The film sets its audience up for the unexpected. You think your getting a feel good film but after the first 10 minutes you are just glued to the edge of your seat in suspense.As I said above, about 10 minutes in, Aron falls down the hole and I thought to myself ""oh great this is going to be so boring now because all now he is stuck in a hole. The reason I thought this is because of previous films, which feature people being stuck and how dull they were to watch. One film I instantly thought of was ""World Trade Center"" directed by Oliver Stone. That film was so long and boring that after a while the audience just didn't care. With this film, Boyle made it interesting because not only did he use flashbacks but he also showed the thoughts running through Aron's mind. The way Boyle does this perfect because he doesn't overuse any of the resources he has. It does a good mix between the actual situation, flashbacks, and visions, which help make this film more intense than any horror film I have seen in recent years.The movie would not be nearly as good without Franco in the lead. Franco is an interesting actor because he started off playing very random roles but then got popular in comedies. Now, Franco seems to go back and forth with comedy and drama. I think this role was perfect for him. Franco fits the look, the build, and even the personality for the film. I didn't think I would ever say Franco deserves an Oscar but he just might for this film. I think a lot of that goes into the solid story and direction of Boyle but it also proves to me at least that Franco has a lot of talent and has what it takes to be a big star.""127 Hours"" proves to me that a good simple story can go a long way with the right people taking on the material. This film is a remarkable and intense film that leaves you as an audience member just sitting on the edge of your seat wondering whats going to happen next. We all heard about the end scene and it's probably one of the most disgusting scenes I have ever seen. I think this scene is so hard to watch because of how real the film is. This isn't a special effects film, it's not about some weird killer, or anything else far-fetched and overused. This is a real story about real people. As I said in the beginning of this review, this movie isn't an easy sell but Boyle turns it into an emotional, edge of your seat film that surely won't disappoint. It takes a talented director, writer and cast (even though small) to make a film like ""127 Hours"" work and this is one film everyone involved should be very proud of.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""127 Hours"" is a solid 9 out of 10. It definitely ranks up there as one of the best films of 2010 and is definitely the most intense!",127 Hours
153,MJB784,Be prepared,9,21 May 2018,The true story of the guy who was trapped in between a rock and a hard place (literally). It's now my choice for the best movie of 2010. Very realistic and frightening. Truly powerful film making that really makes you happy to be alive and realize that anything is possible when it comes to survival.,127 Hours
154,AdrenalinDragon,A simple plot based on a true story that kept me on the edge of my seat!,8,8 January 2011,"You know, when I first heard about this movie. I didn't really know what to expect, as all I knew was it was based on a true story about a guy getting stuck in a canyon due to a boulder. I decided to give it a shot and well, I was amazed by this movie. Danny Boyle continues to give us impressive cinematography and incredible performances in his movie, thanks to James Franco, who plays as Aron Ralston, the mountain climber who gets stuck under the boulder if you didn't already know.I'm not going to go into any big spoilers, but it was amazing to see how the movie builds up to the main plot. After getting stuck under a boulder for 5 days, you're probably thinking ""How is this movie going to stay entertaining?"". Well, we witness some attempts of Aron trying to get out of the boulder, as well as using the equipment he brought with him with his backpack to try and survive. He also tries to keep himself awake so that he can live long enough to not die. When all normal attempts to escape fail, as a last resort, he does something very terrifying to get out. When this scene happened, I had to turn away in parts due to how extreme it was!With good uses of hallucinations and flashbacks to keep the story flowing, Danny Boyle has managed to make this movie as realistic as possible. Great music, great filming, and stunning performance. 127 Hours is a fantastic movie about a real-life incident that may be too disturbing to watch for some people, but I'd consider it a must see on all grounds. Definitely worthy of getting nominated for Best Picture at least surely?",127 Hours
155,colinrgeorge,"Harrowing, If Nothing Else",7,13 October 2010,"There is a threshold for single location films at which they overcome their self-imposed limitations, and though ""127 Hours"" rockets past that point, I don't think it ever transcends its premise. Danny Boyle is a great director, and this is a good film, but there's no getting around the fact that its scope is as limited as the resources in Aron Ralston's backpack.An adaptation of ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place,"" Ralston's true account of having his arm lodged beneath a boulder in an isolated Utah canyon, Boyle's interpretation relies perhaps a little too heavily on the built-in adjectives like 'harrowing' and 'powerful;' he doesn't seem to add many of his own. The film is certainly more successful than this year's ""Buried,"" in which Ryan Reynolds spends the entirety of a film trapped inside a coffin in Iraq, but then Ryan Reynolds is no James Franco.Franco's multifaceted performance really anchors the film and keeps it from becoming stagnant. The journey of his character, from devil-may-care adventurer to anguished prisoner, is kept in constant motion even though he is physically immobile. Franco embraces not only what makes Ralston heroic, but also what makes him human, and we need that accessibility in order to participate in the film's more brutal moments.And Boyle definitely doesn't disappoint in the intensity department. More so than any filmmaker in recent memory, he commands attention with his unflinching depictions of violence here. On the off chance that some aren't yet familiar with the outcome of Ralston's story, I won't spoil it—suffice it to say ""127 Hours"" is not for the squeamish. I consider myself among a generation of roundly desensitized moviegoers, but the way Boyle puts the screws to his audience during key sequences is undeniably affecting. Expect to do a fair amount of squinting and inhaling through gritted teeth.I only wish the film on the whole had the same impact as those isolated scenes. Boyle cobbles together what little conventional narrative he can from the five day ordeal, but it never fully ensnares. Flashbacks seem like a given, though the brief instances of escape we witness via dream or memory aren't especially interesting until they began mingling with Ralston's increasingly distorted reality. Even still, I'd argue Boyle doesn't dig deep enough into Ralston's deteriorating mental state—merely explaining the emotional impetus for his physical actions is about as far as he goes.Part of the problem may be the visual experimentation Boyle implements in the interest of keeping things fresh. It serves that purpose fine—""127 Hours"" is a lively, energetic film in spite of its subject matter. In a way, however, the triptych music video approach feels like Boyle taking the easy way out. After all, the man is a master of genres; a greater feat might have been to capture the quiet desolation and solemnity of Ralston's trip through equally inauspicious filmmaking. It would never have been as exciting a film, but it might have been a better one.Don't get me wrong, ""127 Hours"" is still a terrific accomplishment, and one for which Boyle and Franco deserve joint recognition. It feels like a minor entry into the esteemed director's oeuvre, but the creative decisions he made (fault them though I might) showcase his ever- innovative eye for shooting and editing. The visceral impact of the images he conveys is unquestionably the foremost strength of this film, and it is that aspect that critics have already lauded and audiences will doubtless remember.The effectiveness of such scenes earn ""127 Hours"" an adjective like 'harrowing.' I just can't quite bring myself to call it powerful.",127 Hours
156,thekyles99,I'm thinking i need a break from this genre!,4,17 January 2011,"I have read a lot of reviews on this flick and think people are taking this film for its philosophical sense rather than my own opinion of the film which was more on the level of show me something i haven't seen before. I have said it before that the film's star James Franco will be one of the greats in the near future and i still stand by that quote 100%. One trait i like in my ever growing list of favourite actors in the biz today is the fact that they can capture the essence of the actual moment that their pertaining character they are portraying more than likely felt at that given time which is bringing a certain sense to the films of today and that is the sense that Hollyweird lacks in as of late, the sense of realism. Franco plays real life veteran mountain climber Aron Ralston, who after a mishap during one of his ventures gets trapped in a crevice in an isolated canyon in Utah. Leaving him all alone with only his own demons to conquer. I know human error leading towards the most compelling 'need to survive' stories that make it to the big screen are usually the ones that capture our hearts, however maybe i need to give this certain realm of motion picture a much needed rest for awhile. this reviewer left this film feeling meh! It was alright when most viewers were more along the lines of the wow! factor. Personal tastes i guess?",127 Hours
157,RhapsodyReviews,Beautiful Film About Will Power.,10,1 January 2020,"Review:
'127 Hours' is a biographical-survival-drama film directed by Danny Boyle. It is based on Aron Ralston's memoir 'Between a Rock and a Hard Place'.
With this movie having such a small cast and actors aside from James Franco getting a small amount of screen time, the movie falls on his and Danny Boyle's shoulders.
In the film, canyoner Aron Ralston must find a way to escape after he gets trapped by a boulder in an isolated slot canyon in Bluejohn Canyon, southeastern Utah, in April 2003.
James Franco is very impressive, delivering a performance that is entirely convincing and a genuine step up for the actor. It's his movie to win or lose and he shines brightly in it making his character likable from the beginning making us want him to win.
The direction in this movie is pure art. Danny Boyle uses some great techniques and shots to move the story on. Personally, nothing feels forced or out of place, and the effects are believable and realistic. The pacing is good, and it never loses the concept of what it wants to achieve.
Overall, if you know the story then the movie is what you expect and there are no twists or turns along the way. Its story telling at its finest, and it may be simple, but when it's done like this it can be.

158,Slarkshark,Top Notch Survival Tale,8,3 April 2021,"Right near the top of its class when it comes to survival movies. What a story of survival instinct. Aron Ralston realized he had made a mistake, but he didn't succumb to it. He was able to persevere, dig deep, and did what was necessary in order to go on and live a very full life afterwards.Danny Boyle did an incredible job bringing the viewer back to the year 2003, from the music to the technology, and overall lingo. The scenery was remarkable. His ability to build an engaging story with someone being stuck in one position the entire time shows his talent. Of course, James Franco deserves a huge amount of credit as well. His best work that I've seen him do and I'm writing this eleven years since the movie came out. The word visceral comes to mind when trying to describe how Ralston's predicament is portrayed. The camera work combined with Franco's acting makes one feel as if they can actually understand in some small degree what Ralston had to go through.As long you can stomach a few intense, graphic scenes this is a must watch for at least one viewing.",127 Hours
159,maximkong,Should rely less on flashbacks and focus more on the present survival skills,6,18 November 2012,"I do not know how accurate this film is to the actual case, but it has done a good job to cover as much as possible portraying a realistic simulation of such incident. However the film could have done more to reveal certain things -- like how does he poop, how does he stay clean and, how does he not grow his facial hair etc... I am pretty sure the director or screenwriter should know the answers to these issues when they have done enough research and interview on the actual victim himself. It is not an excuse to avoid displaying these survival skills which could have been far more interesting than the too many flashbacks that were being usedCinematography is unique and Franco did well to carry out probably one of his first main roles in a film.People will certainly remember this film for a long time for its particularly outstanding climax scene.",127 Hours
160,seaview1,The Agony and Ecstasy of 127 HOURS,8,25 February 2011,"Based on the harrowing tale of survival by Aron Ralston and adapted by Simon Beaufoy and director Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire, 28 Days Later), 127 Hours challenges the viewer to share in a difficult, life changing event that most people could never contemplate. It's quite a feat to engage and emotionally move an audience focused solely on one person in one place. For an actor to pull this off is a great testament to James Franco's acting skills and physical prowess as well as Boyle's ingenuity behind the camera. In April, 2003, Aron Ralston (Franco) escapes the rat race of the city to go hiking in a remote terrain. After parking his car, he goes mountain biking and then by foot deeper into isolation. There, he comes upon two hikers, Megan and Kristi, who are a bit lost. He tells them that the earth with its rocks and mountains is always moving. How prophetic! Aron guides the women and puts them on the right track after a brief adventure in a cave and a sparkling pool of water. Later, he proceeds on his trek of solitude and, while climbing between a narrow ravine, slips, and as he falls, a large bolder tumbles and pins his arm against the wall. Trying everything possible to dislodge the rock, he finds he is hopelessly trapped with limited supplies. No one knows where he is because he was didn't care enough to mention it to family or friends. He is a confident, even cocky explorer whose cavalier attitude changes through this ordeal. He displays some amazing resourcefulness in such moments as when he erects a mini tent to protect his head from the elements. As he waits in vain for help that is not coming, he contemplates his survival skills and evaluates his life and relationships. Life is precious, and he must do whatever he can to survive even if it means the unthinkable. The entire film works despite the fact it centers exclusively on one actor. (The Spirit of St. Louis is another that comes to mind.) Franco accomplishes the difficult task by making us care for an arrogant, free spirit who knows no fear. The film focuses on minute details that could easily be glossed over. The simplest of acts become a tortuous struggle as when his pocket knife falls and he must retrieve it while still pinned. A drink of water from his ever shrinking supply becomes an agonizing death watch. The flashback scenes give us some background into his family life and a former girlfriend. He even fantasizes a vision of a boy, a son that he will perhaps have someday? He regrets the things left undone or unsaid and resolves to make changes in his life if he makes it out alive. The fact that we know the outcome does not at all diminish the agony we feel for him in close quarters and his determination to survive. In a way the big rock is a kind of metaphor for his life. What should be a liberating journey becomes a test of survival, and as the hours go by and one day bleeds into the next, we become a part of his limited world complete with cracks of sunlight and an occasional bird or insect. After awhile you wonder if we really see images he is seeing, or if it is nothing more than a mirage or hallucination. During his ordeal he uses his mini video camera to document his plight and to report on his situation and feelings. The camera becomes a sort of confessor for him. Yes, the scene where he must separate himself from the rock is excruciating but never exploitive. The subsequent scenes where he makes his way back to civilization and encounters other hikers are powerfully heart wrenching yet life affirming. It packs a punch and wrings you emotionally as Franco finds salvation when all hope is seemingly lost. By film's end we breathe a collective sigh of relief. Yet it is the cumulative effect of emotions and our shared experience with him that are truly affecting. Boyle utilizes hand-held cameras and crisp editing to keep things moving along in a methodically paced narrative. It is ironic at how the beautiful landscape is in sharp contrast to the horror that Aron must experience. The film may set a record for having the longest running time before displaying its first title card. There is a nice epilogue which alludes to his prophetic visions from before. This is not a morbid exercise in claustrophobia or grossness but rather a realistic recreation of the triumph of the human spirit against impossible odds and the bleakest of settings.",127 Hours
161,blacklist-1,A truly captivating and forever memorable story about the human will to survive.,10,10 January 2011,"Danny Boyle's very good film Slumdog Millionaire scooped eight Oscars. 127 Hours his follow up has been nominated for 3 Golden Globes and already eighteen other nomination categories, which includes Best Leading Man, James Franco. Frankly 127 Hours deserves a handful of these. This movie grabbed my attention straight away, from the first shot. Throughout we see the camera split in two screens, hand-held, documentary style like camera and conventional shooting. The first minute shows a marvellous split screen montage, which is then split into three as we are introduced to James Franco's character based on a true story Aron Ralston who whilst hiking and climbing in the canyons of Utah comes across two pretty female hikers Kristi (Kate Mara) and Megan (Amber Tamblyn) who are lost, he helps them find their way and they find out is a cocky, daredevil free type guy who likes to have fun when they jump into a large pool from climbing in between two walls that opens into a large cave face. I felt the rush and adrenaline as he and the girls jumped into the pool as though I was actually there and that's what makes this thing even more authentic with the way it was shot and the fact it is based on a true story.Eventually though he leaves them to do his own thing but falls down a small canyon and gets his right arm stuck between the wall and large rock. This happens about twenty minutes in and from the look in Aron's eyes it's clear he never faced this sort of helplessness before. From here we really get inside the character's head as he tries desperately to escape trying several methods, whilst at the same time trying to survive on little food and water as he talks into his video-camera about how he feels as he begins to hallucinate as his situation deteriorates rapidly over the five days he is stuck there. From being trapped Aron starts to realise his selfishness at how he has lived his life and treated other people like not keeping in contact with his parents, by taking them for granted and his unwillingness to commit. All these are told in flashbacks. Also wisely throughout Aron's ordeal Boyle has added a few moments of bleak humour that lightens the mood slightly and gives the film a better balance.127 Hours is truly a film that perfectly captures the human spirit and will to survive as we see Aron desperately trying to escape his predicament. We the audience are fully versed to Aron's fear and regrets, as I felt whilst watching it, the fact I sometimes take my family for granted and for a movie to do that, make the viewer pause and reflect on themselves is not something that is easily done, which makes the film all the more clever for it. Not only that you are tuned to the notion of coming to care about him and want him to get out as I related to him, you can place yourself in his shoes imagining yourself in a similar situation. The stylish camera-work helps reinforce that but so does James Franco's performance, I quite like him in the Spiderman films, but this was more real-life, serious drama and a role that challengingly flexed him and he worked up to it, with a performance of his life. It was tremendous and he has already been nominated for an award, which is richly deserved. As to far as the amputation scene, it is very brutal, yes and if you are squeamish of blood I wouldn't recommend it but the full impact is shortened in the film so it isn't as shocking as it seems and I have seen worse. 127 Hours though I can recommend fully for those who want to find a simple but incredibly fascinating true story of character. I saw my first film of the year last week, which was The Next Three Days with Russell Crowe, which was excellent, but this was even better. This film is serious contender for best film of 2011 so far, but there are still eleven months to go so we'll see. Let's hope 2011 for terrific films continues. 127 Hours truly is one of the most memorable films I have ever seen and I can't give it higher praise than that.",127 Hours

But he remembers a digital camera and a video-camera that apparently has enough battery-power to last 127 hours. He gets trapped in a canyon when he's arm is crushed under a big rock. After 127 hours he cuts his arm off.This movie is pointless and boring and a piece of trash and not the masterpiece people make it out to be. It's not a movie about survival and the guy is NOT a hero. This is a guy that left everything back home, including his brain. And it's not a miracle that he survived, more, just dumb luck. Avoid this snooze-fest even on TV.",127 Hours
163,priyantha-bandara,You should not miss this,8,19 February 2011,"My score 4/5 There are good movies and then there are great movies. There shouldn't be an epic plot or dozens of well known cast in order for one to be a great one. But it's a must to be something new and should have the capacity to explore the deepest human emotions and ability to inject them directly in to the viewers blood. '127 hours' has all that packed with adrenalin gushing truly painful 94mts.The story is very simple and straight forward. Aron Ralston (Played by James Franco – Spider Man) who is a mountain climber sets off climbing in Utah with high spirits as usual on a one fine Saturday. But he finds himself to be in a death defying situation soon after he met with an accident and trapped in between boulders with a big rock crushing his arm. Now he faces the challenge of getting out alive before he runs out of supplies and most importantly his state of mind. (This situation which immediately reminds me of the similar Discovery- I shouldn't be alive Episode 'trapped under a boulder'. Though it has some resemblance it's important to know that both of them are true life stories and very unique at some points. Recommended!)The script is so strong that it will eventually force you to experience what Aron is going though. What kind of pain he must be bearing up and what emotions, hallucinations and memories he eventually gets trapped in. And most importantly what a man will become and can become when he is faced with the greatest challenge of his life. Aron at times looses hope and record himself saying sorry and good bye to his parents on the camcorder he has but on the next moment he mutter to himself 'Do not loose it' and struggle to overcome the situation. James Franco does a breath taking job making this character plain impossible to forget. Coming from the once Oscar winning director of 'Slumdog Millionaire' Danny Boyle '127 Hours' is not at all a disappointment. Trust me it can be very hard to watch when the real ordeal roll out but if you manage to get though them with one piece of mind then I'm sure you will feel how heroic you are when everything is over. Cinematographically very challenging to pull off which mostly takes place in a very tight space with most of the close up shots, the job is well done. Time to time it gives you some space when Aron's memories comes alive and the sets take place elsewhere but you are quickly returned to the tight spot abandoning all your craziest hopes of escape. '127 hours' is not a super hero movie or even a story of a real life hero. It's a story of a person like you and me with ambitions and interests who suddenly finds himself to be in a situation where he has to make real hard decisions to live further. Once the movie finished we all feel glad that he made correct decision even how hard it maybe. And that's something for all of us to keep in mind. The most important decisions in life are not the easiest ones but they will make you live stronger afterwords. more of my reviews at flickshout.blogspot.com",127 Hours
164,Jonathon_Natsis,"If there was ever a story that needed to be told, it's this one.",9,11 February 2011,"The phrase 'remarkably true story' gets thrown around a lot these days. Sure, some of the greatest films of all time are shaped by actual events (see: Goodfellas, Dog Day Afternoon and Cool Runnings), as are a handful of contemporary Best Picture hopefuls in The King's Speech, The Social Network and 127 Hours. But the latter is perhaps the only one that really has the ability to connect with the viewer on such an emotional level. This film presents to us an amazing story of survival and human will in the face of certain death, expertly delivered by director Danny Boyle and Best Actor nominee James Franco.I make the point to not divulge too many plot details in my reviews, but I feel an exception can be made in this case, since the story is so well known. Aron Ralston is a mountain climber intent on journeying through the treacherous Blue John Canyon in Utah. He meets two girls along the way, but continues on his own. He slips while climbing down a narrow rock face, causing a small avalanche in which a boulder traps him between, literally, a rock and a hard place. With his food and water supply running low, and his hallucinations becoming more intense, Aron realises the only way to free himself is to hack off his own arm, after which he ventures out of the canyon and is rescued just before bleeding to death.Danny Boyle is a director with great skill in exposing his audience to the very ends of the Earth. Be it the gloomy backstreets of Trainspotting, or the vibrant Indian flavour of Slumdog Millionaire, he always ensures the setting dosen't just fulfil its role, but stands out as a piece of art. 127 Hours is no different, as vast, sweeping views of the desert and Steadycam shots inside the labyrinth that is Blue John Canyon contribute handsomely to a foreboding sense of isolation and claustrophobia.In contrast, when Aron becomes trapped underground, it is the editing that takes over the cinematography as the primary means of fleshing out the film. Flashbacks and quick cuts allow the viewer to get inside Aron's mindset at any given point, and I found it an accurate portrayal of how, even in times of crisis and great panic, the mind can wander and emotions can change instantly. A standout scene, and a great example of what I'm trying to explain, occurs when Aron pretends he is a guest on a comedic talk show, jokingly explaining how he is about to die, only minutes after recalling how desperately he wants to see his family. If you ignore the other (very minor) roles played by the rest of his unknown cast, James Franco is the only actor in this movie, and it goes without saying that the film would collapse if his performance lacked conviction. Luckily, he puts immense effort into a screenplay the real Aron Ralston called '99.9% accurate'. His turn is unlikely to earn him Best Actor, but he certainly stamps his authority on his own film more than any other nominees do in their respective films. Of course, I couldn't review 127 Hours without giving my opinion on 'that' scene, which is alluded to in the beginning with some excellent use of foreshadowing, by the way. Is it gruesome? I wouldn't dispute that. It is glorified, existing only to disgust? Absolutely not. I couldn't take my eyes of the screen, only because I was keen to see for myself the amount of realism injected into such an intense moment. And believe me, it is intense. Personally, not sickening. But if in doubt, I'd say proceed with caution. Ultimately, though, it's best not to dwell on this single scene, but appreciate the entire film addressing the idea that life is not about what is lost through adversity, but what is gained through determination. What a shame that my three favourite films this year have, collectively, slim-to-nil chance of winning the top prize.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

165,cdjh-81125,A Rock and A Hard Place,8,7 September 2017,"With Danny Boyle being such a unique film maker it's a given that he will take a lot of risks in his careers and ""127 Hours"" is definitely one of them. Having a film mostly set in the same location, with one character can be tricky but Boyle and James Franco pulled it off fantastically. Danny Boyle made this film as engaging as it is, the way he directed this movie ensured that you knew exactly how desperate this situation was, he used a lot of footage from the camcorder, a lot of fast edits to show Ralstons deteriorating mental health Anne he also didn't leave the location of the canyon that often, it made you feel as if you were in this location with this one character and helped you better buy into his situation. I've always really liked James Franco, both in his comedy roles and more serious dramatic works he's consistently surprised me with his range but nothing more than his work in this movie with his amazing performance. Not only does he make him instantly likable and engaging with his natural charm but when things start to get more desperate Franco nails the more emotionally intense scenes that help you sympathise with the character a lot more than any of the flashbacks. This film didn't pull any punches, the eventual scene where Ralston has to cut of his arm is breathtakingly realistic, the sound effects, Franco's performance and excellent prosthetics come together to make you believe that what is happening on screen is as close to what it must have been like in real life. It also doesn't hold back on the more emotionally devastating moments where Ralston confesses to his failings and short comings that help you to realise what someone will do or say when they are as close to death as this man was. My only real issue with this movie is the rather on the nose flashbacks, I'm not saying that I objected to learning more about Ralston as a person, I just think that seeing anyone in this horrific situation is enough to get the viewer to sympathise with him. A lot of them did add something to his character but a lot didn't really do anything for me. While I'm not going to rush back to watch this film, as a viewing experience this is a film that any major film fan should watch at some point. Thanks to Franco's amazing work, Boyles masterful direction and excellent use of the premises gritty tone this is something that I believe will stay with anyone who watches it. 8.6/10: A- (Fantastic)",127 Hours

167,Oktay_Tuna,127 Hours: Being Stuck Literally and Metaphorically,8,20 July 2020,"I knew I was going to like this movie, it has James Franco on the lead who is both charismatic and talented and the crew behind the camera are also masterful. What I wasn't expecting was the depth of the story. Aron is stuck in his current life mentally and then he gets stuck physically and the movie does make a great job connecting these things. This movie seems like it really happened(I know it actually happened but some biographies just mess this up and even facts might sound impossible) and the phases Aron goes through are shot and directed beautifully. His memories really add a lot to this movie. The thing I liked the most about this movie is how it arranges its time. I expected a formula of 10 minutes-(10 hours later)- 10 minutes which really wouldn't fit this movie. For example, we see Franco trying to escape and we get the fact that he spent 3 hours doing this activity which proves the masterful editing in this movie. The comedy in this movie is also unironically really good. I think the first 15 minutes of the movie could have been cut into 3 minutes which is pretty annoying to think about when the movie is less than 90 minutes(if you cut the credits). The movie had some parts which could've been cut or stretched. These parts(especially some of the memories) progress throughout the movie but then the movie ends before they create an important message. So, the things I like the most and the least are about time. Time structure of the movie isn't good but the representation of how time passes in the canyon is awesome.",127 Hours
168,neenahhh,They didn't have to turn Aron Ralston's story into a 94 min. movie,3,4 May 2011,"James Franco plays Aron Ralston, a man who enjoys mountain climbing. ""127 Hours"" follows Aron as he prepares for a great hike out in the Grand Canyon. He's confident in his abilities, with good reason, so he doesn't bother telling anyone where he's off to. Yet, even an experienced hiker, who has his head packed full of survival knowledge, can't prepare for everything.I was excited to watch this, given all of the hype. But after watching it, I can say that whatever I was expecting in this movie, just wasn't there. The movie was tedious. The first 20 minutes were all right. I enjoyed Aron's bonding time with the 2 girls and I was quite shocked and surprised after seeing the boulder fall down and crush his arm. We then see Aron pushing the rock, grunting, crying, drinking water, filming, etc. That was literally all the happened throughout the entire middle portion of the film. It got repetitive and boring! Though I admit, it makes me wonder why I just didn't stop watching. Maybe I was curious to see how it all ended.This film could have been better if the movie was shorter or if they spent some time building Aron's character. What we saw on film (from the flashbacks) was just a man who loved adventure and liked being by himself that he didn't bother telling anyone where he was heading off to. That's all I got from the flashbacks.I admit, Aron's triumph was no easy feat. I'm sure I would have given up, if I was in that position. So, congratulations to Aron! But really, they didn't have to make it into a full-length movie. Tedious and repetitive, really.Viewed on: May 5, 2011",127 Hours
169,dharmendrasingh,Man vs. Nature,6,17 January 2011,"Adapting mountaineer Aron Ralston's autobiography 'Between a Rock and a Hard Place' , Danny Boyle gives us a reconstruction of his freak accident in a remote Utah canyon, and his outré survival tactics during the 127 hours he was caught between a rock and a wall in a hard place. What saves Ralston, besides near-mythical courage, is his engineering expertise. He attempts to make pulleys to dislodge the boulder. When these fail he is forced to break bones to slice off his decayed arm, using inappropriate cutting tools to do so. Hard to make this compulsive viewing, as most of the static action takes place in a canyon. But then Boyle is the man who immortalised Irvine Welsh's 'Trainspotting', another book thought to be unfilmable. We've seen breathtaking scenery before, but not like this. Luscious photography means you don't physically have to be in this region to appreciate its grandeur. To hold our attention, Boyle throws everything at us: split screen, catchy pop songs, state-of-the art special effects. I have only a few reservations, but they are significant. I didn't like the scenes of phantasmagoria. I felt they came too often and were off-putting. I also disliked James Franco's portrayal. Praise has been given for him being able to convincingly capture Ralston's self-deprecation and charm, but there's a reason he wasn't Boyle's first choice (British actor Cillian Murphy was): he's as flat as parts of Utah. Sometimes, when a film does phenomenally well, like Boyle's 'Slumdog Millionaire', the success somehow attaches to the director's next film, regardless of the critical reception, and our objectivity gets distorted. It's as though we see their next film with predetermined praise. I think that's what audiences the world over are doing with this film.By his own admission Boyle prefers to make 'vivacious' rather than 'serious' films. '127 Hours' does not contradict. This is another demonstration of style over substance. Sad, given that Ralston did not want his 'life-affirming' experience to be commodified. www.scottishreview.net",127 Hours
170,jonnyfendi,It was 8 Minutes of Great Music and 1 Hour 27 Minutes of Pure Thrills,8,21 January 2011,"The movie is based on an autobiography book ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"" (2004) by Aron Ralston, and you can see the movie title is ""127 Hours"". Without tell you any further, you can conclude yourself, he would survive after all, right? The golden question will be how did he survive? British Director, Danny Boyle is one of my favorite Directors of all-time, I note he is always good with the number on his movie titles such as ""28 Days Later.."" (2002) and ""Millions"" (2004). After telling an inspiring story in India through ""Slumdog Millionaire"" (2008), he takes us back to the United States. The incident occurred at Blue john Canyon (the Utah desert) where solitary mountaineer Aron Ralston fell into a canyon and being trapped under a boulder. Aron is played by James Franco. The movie starts with an energetic mood and spirit, plus stylish split screen and exhilarating music as well. As long as I remember, Boyle always could make an enjoyable adventure experience with his vigorously music, and thiz time he does it either. James Franco takes on responsibility for his one-man-show very well. My favorite act is when he imitates the host of ""Morning Live Show' and pretends to interview himself. He is very convincing by delivering nail-biting and captivating performances all at once, just like what Ryan Reynold did recently when he was being ""Buried"" (2010). Once again, Boyle shows his capability of capturing human despair by mixing hallucination scenes and flashback sequences. Overall, it was 8 minutes of great music and 1 hour 27 minutes of pure thrills. In the end, I can assure you that Aron's experience is not simple as you think. When you are being trapped like him, it's just okay if you know you are going to survive in 127 hours ahead, maybe you can manage something to get through of that. But the real situation is not that simple, Aron didn't know for how long he would be stuck in there or even whether or not he was going to survive in that moment. Last time, Danny Boyle introduced us the exotic of Phi Phi Leh Island (near Phuket , Thailand) through ""The Beach"" (2000). After that movie, thousands of people crowded that place. Thiz time, Boyle shows us the beauty of Utah Canyon, I 'm pretty sure people will go there as well. Can't wait what place he will take us next time.

171,piratecannon,Rock On,9,26 December 2012,"Danny Boyle has turned out to be the quite the multifaceted auteur. He's created unique examples of what are possible with both the horror and science fiction genres (at times blending the two), and he's tackled the grim reality of humanity in his Oscar-winning film Slumdog Millionaire. It should come as no surprise, then, that 127 Hours is a beautifully filmed, expertly nuanced story about what fuels both delirium and perseverance.The movie is based on a true story. In 2003, canyoneer Aron Ralston decided to embark on a weekend hike in a mountainous region of Utah. After miscalculating a step while traversing a crevice, Aron fell down a sheer embankment and had his arm pinned against the cliff face by an oblong boulder. As you'd expect, a previously happy-go-lucky situation turns gruesome in a split-second, and, to make matters worse, it's only a matter of time before Aron depletes his limited supply of water and prepackaged goodies.A misconception that seems to linger about 127 Hours is that exists for the singular ""gross out"" moment—you know, when our protagonist realizes his only chance of escape is to whittle away at this trapped arm until a bloody stump is all that remains. In fact, Boyle's film is more focused on Aron's life leading up to the accident, which is wrought with the misgivings of someone who's been much too selfish. As it turns out, it would take something as drastic as facing a life or death situation for Aron to come to grips with his passive-aggressive abandonment of everyone he's ever cared for.By allowing us into the mind of our lead we're able to experience how a dehydration-fueled delirium brought to light the things in Mr. Ralston's life that actually matter. So integral are these hallucinations that it's sometimes difficult to separate what Aron is really going through as opposed to what's taking place in his mind, but Boyle expertly balances his tale by bringing Aron (and the audience) back to reality when things seem to be utterly lost in a maze of all-too-tangible illusions.Besides the thematic victories that are embodied in 127 Hours, it's also —quite simply—a movie that's very easy on the eyes. The rolling canyons and red plains make for a stunning backdrop, and the horror unfolding in the small crack Aron inhabits serves as an effective juxtaposition to the sprawling beauty that's just beyond his reach (figuratively, literally, etc.).In short, Boyle strikes again. Pay the $10 for a ticket and catch this one before it leaves theaters.Trust me. It's worth it.",127 Hours
172,LiveLoveLead,Intense!!!,8,27 December 2012,"The beginning of the move was filmed a little erratic for me. Music, talking, 3 way split screen...hyper, but that seemed to fit Aron Ralston's personality...a quirky, lovin' life, adventurer. They try to film in a way that you see and feel what he sees and feels, which works. The scenery is beautiful...hold your breath! Half way through...WOW! You feel for him, cringe for him, try to help him (from your comfy couch) and most of all pray for him. You will be on the edge of your seat, watching, anticipating, encouraging, and hoping.

173,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,Something Out of Nothing,7,16 January 2014,"Considering how simple the story is, 127 Hours turns out to be a very good film.I thought the build up was good, the acting mostly excellent, but the story itself was nothing more than a guy with his hand trapped under a boulder trying to work out the best way to keep sane and survive for as long as possible.Will he survive, for how long and what would I do in this situation, were the sort of questions that I asked myself during the film. How frustrating to be trapped like that, such a vigorous man rendered completely useless through no fault of his own, or perhaps the unthinkable - death, just trapped there and dying, alone.Danny Boyle is an extremely good film-maker who has a knack of dramatising pretty ordinary situations, but there's also something a bit cheesy about his camera work which I don't get along with. Just a minor criticism.It's not the sort of film that'll have you wondering about for days or weeks afterwards, but it is a tremendous piece of entertainment for such a simple concept - the indignation of being a prisoner through no fault of your own.",127 Hours
174,imagiking,"127 Hours: Inconsequential, Inconclusive, and Disappointing",6,4 February 2011,"It's difficult, around this time of year, to maintain one's cynicism toward awards ceremonies. So many major winners of the last decade have, to me, seemed so horridly overrated that it is difficult to lend any credence to an Oscar nomination anymore. Nonetheless, I was drawn into the premise of 127 Hours: the prospect of a single setting, and the ever likable James Franco.A true-life story of climber/canyoneer Aron Ralston, 127 Hours follows the character as he sets out for the weekend to Blue John canyon. Having told nobody where he is going, Ralston intends to fully enjoy the escapism the wilderness brings. This self-imposed isolation becomes a burden, however, when he finds himself trapped, a fallen boulder crushing his arm against a crevasse wall.The praise heaped upon writer/director Danny Boyle following his previous effort Slumdog Millionaire is indelibly related to the cynicism mentioned above. Slumdog, for me, was a perfectly fine film, but in no way deserving of such championing. Boyle's position as director was something of a bad omen as such, leaving me slightly worried about what might happen with the film. These worries appear justified almost immediately, Boyle splitting the screen to a triptych (though technically not) showing large crowds of people. This carries on for almost ten minutes, the broken screen fine for a credit sequence but rapidly tired-out and overused almost immediately after. Thankfully it subsides eventually, allowing us to take in the wonderful setting of the film. The vast canyon expanse is quite, quite beautiful, given appropriate treatment with wide angle lenses. It is fewer than twenty minutes before Ralston becomes trapped, the trailer-featured scenes with two female fellow adventurers apparently consisting of the entirety of their presence in the film. Not that I'm complaining, mind; sitting in a canyon with James Franco was what I paid to do. And Franco is wonderful, his performance carrying the film exactly as it needs to. One moment in particular, immediately after Ralston's hallucinatory imagining of a talk show, demonstrates perfectly Franco's humanity in this role. Unfortunately, Boyle seems to have insufficient confidence in entrusting the entirety of the film to the strength of Franco's performance, and consequentially we are left with regular flashbacks, imagined party scenes, bizarre appearances of Scooby Doo, and agonisingly infuriating gimmicky camera-work. It seems as though the film is trying to add a layer of quirky geekiness to its effects, and these prove little more than distracting and deprecating, leaving us with fewer moments of pure performance. An additional qualm comes in the form of Ralston's character as expressed in the film. I found his story inescapably comparable to that of Christopher McCandless, the inspiration behind Sean Penn's infinitely superior Into the Wild. Unlike Into the Wild, 127 Hours does not manage to build itself a protagonist with sufficient depth of characterisation to craft a meaningful message, resigning itself instead to the status of mere story. We emerge from 127 Hours with little on our minds to consider, save the reuse of that damned triptych effect.Though its star delivers a very fine performance—when the director has faith enough to allow him to perform, that is—127 Hours just seems inconsequential, inconclusive, and disappointing. This is the sort of film from which one should take home a message of sorts, but the thinly-sketched and unconflicted character at its heart prevents any such meaningfulness. Oddly enough, it's this film's potential which drags it down.",127 Hours
175,Ziglet_mir,"Mostly ""eh"" with great sound editing",5,4 December 2010,"The highlight of 127 Hours is that certain scene I think has most folks intrigued to see this. Until then, it's a slow-burn kinda-deal with Franco on center stage.The score is intriguing, but what really got me was the use of sound to relay the emotion of Franco in almost every moment of the film. Those who do not like painful and bloody messes should be aware, for I had a hard time watching the awaited scene with his arm. But then again everyone in the theater cringed when it all happened, so I wasn't the only one.See it if you dig Danny Boyle and especially if you're a Franco fan, even though I think the film lacks many qualities of a great film. 127 Hours is possibly Franco's best performance so far, maybe with the exception of Freaks and Geeks.",127 Hours
176,thomvic,Captures it all pretty well in under two hours for '127 hours'....,8,25 March 2011,"This film in the first five minutes almost feels like it could be potentially be a promo for a Tony Hawk skateboarding short film. What you pretty much sense is that the protagonist seems a bit of a free spirit, plays by his own rules and does things on his own. 127 Hours is a film about survival. That's what you obviously get from the trailer. But it is also a film about the choices we have made in life and how they lead us to a certain situation. When you really look back at all the things you have done, no matter how small, does it lead you to a destined path? There are those people who end up in drastic situations and near death experiences which make them think about life from a different perspective. Then you have those who are given that chance to think about life while playing the waiting game, or if you would rather call it, the holding onto hope game. I'd say 127 Hours is a bit of both. James Franco plays Aaron who gets stuck down below a crevasse with a hard rock and a difficult spot. The focus of the film is on him and once he gets himself into the situation, you know what is going to happen after; getting out. But it is not that simple. You feel the experience he is in, the hopelessness yet determination to not give up. With his trusty camera with him, psychologically he stays alert through filming himself, playing scenarios that almost serve as a light comedy, while also remembering memories of his parents and his ex girlfriend.Danny Boyle made a terrific and moving film with Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours brings us into the fear of being trapped in the middle of nowhere. If any of us was in this situation, would you have the guts to do what Aaron does? Would you give up and admit defeat or is your willingness to live strong enough so that you might appreciate life more afterwards? These are questions only you can answer.The isolation and loneliness are captured perfectly through the eerie yet beautiful cinematography of the landscape in Roobers Roost, Utah. The scene which everyone talks about is of course the cutting off the arm scene. Now, if this scene had absolutely no music, it would not have been a huge ordeal and I could have easily sat through it while sipping a cup of tea. But the music really gives it an edge and it is like it is making you feel the pain at the same time, and while it doesn't last long, it stings, so I can see how audiences have been reacting to this. Seeing the images of Aaron's face with blood and a horrific look on his face was enough to make me feel chills.This is a simple tale of survival, but it is one in which it is real because Aaron is not made out to be a hero or anything; he is simply just a normal man who has a will to live and to fix up the mistakes he has made in his life. The thing I liked about it is that you discover who this man is and it wastes no time in building his character up – the first twenty minutes pretty much gets to the point of where the plot should go. While Aaron is thinking about his life while trapped down there, you contemplate his life with him. You understand that he feels that he got himself down there through his choices in life – it will make sense when you watch it in how he comes to the conclusion that it is his fault due to the fact that he chose to be alone in life. You also understand why he has to cut his arm off, because when given little alternative besides death, there is no choice.It makes you wonder about the people you take for granted in life. Small things such as letting them know we are alright and telling them where we are. Because you never know when there is a time in your life when telling someone what you are doing can change everything for you. It just makes you think about that a little harder, and in this day of age when it is so easy to let people know via a text where we are, why not use it so people can have a peace of mind?",127 Hours
177,blackburnj-1,Gruelling and gripping,8,15 January 2011,"[4 Stars] This is a film made with Boyle's characteristic energy and intensity. The brutal story of Aaron Ralston's struggle to survive when he got trapped in the middle of nowhere, with only a rock on his arm preventing his escape, is brought vividly to life, primarily through an inventive script which manages to make one man in a hole for five days and a bit utterly engrossing, as well as a spectacular central performance from James Franco who is utterly believable in every second of arrogance, strife and madness.The scene where Ralston finally forces his way free through very drastic means is suitably gruelling and difficult to watch, but it is not gratuitous.It is curious to know what you're getting out of this film. Boyle has described it as ""a feel-good film"". Though it has life-affirming and uplifting elements, it is too gruelling to be described as that. Ultimately, it is a testament to very great value of personal relationships, that are so easy to take for granted.Not one of Boyle's very finest, but another excellent film which is well worth the money.",127 Hours

179,hoxjennifer,Who is Aron Ralston?,7,23 April 2014,"127 Hours is the incredible true story of a naive outdoors man/engineer who embarks on a journey into a remote canyon without telling anyone his whereabouts for the weekend. He gets into a terrible accident, leaving his right hand stuck under a boulder and no way out for, as the title implies, 127 hours. As he fights for survival, having to resort to very desperate measures, the viewer catches glimpses of his life - moments that he is fond of and moments that he regrets. I was unaware that this film was nominated for several Oscars upon my initial viewing, but I'm not too surprised. The cinematography is brilliant which contributes to the way the filming was executed. More than half of the film is spent with Aron Ralston (James Franco) as he struggles to survive in the canyon - yet we never get bored of being there with him in the one scene. The storyline is also unique and the message is inspiring. However, I did not give this film 10/10. That is simply because although we the audience got to know our protagonist as he struggled to come to grips with his predicament and realize his own flaws in life, I felt that the film was lacking in exploring his character before the accident. The first twenty minutes of the film before the accident occurs was, in my opinion, awkward and rushed. I didn't feel any genuine connection with the character and it seemed like the accident was just waiting to happen to get the film going. I would've preferred to learn more about him as a person just from the movie, although I haven't read the book to be fair so this is simply how it was written.Great film overall.. but in terms of character development I felt like it could have started off with more and expanded further.",127 Hours

181,raphaklopper,"Danny Boyle's ""Cast Away"".",9,21 November 2013,"One question: what happens when director Danny Boyle, who made the classic zombie movie ""28 days later"" and the gripping drama ""Slumdog Millionaire"", decides to make a biopic of the climber Aron Ralston based on a book that himself wrote? Perhaps one of the best cinematic experiences that someone will have in a movie.For those who don't know the story on which the film was based on, here is a small synopsis here: Aron Ralston (James Franco) is a simple professional mountaineer who plans to one day do canyoning in the Grand Canyon National Park (canyoning » Canyon, get it?) in Utah. When he is climbing through a narrow passage in the middle of the mountain, Aron slips on a loose rock and falls in the middle of the hole with the same rock trapping his right arm. Aron tries to push the stone but fails, cries for help and also fails. Now Aron will have to try to survive and escape that hole before his food and water finish, and he ends up having to amputate his own arm with a blunt penknife.Hell, we can almost say that this film is Danny Boyle's ""Cast Away"", only that is located in the Grand Canyon and it doesn't has no coconut called Wilson, only James Franco in a hole, with only two or three other secondary characters. Many may think that this can be boring or tedious, but as I said before, Boyle gives us an unforgettable experience.""But how the hell 94 minutes of James Franco in a hole can be interesting?"". Well, I don't know, maybe the good script of Boyle and Simon Beaufoy maintaining a great line of realism in the story with well-written and even reflective monologues with the character of Aron talking to himself recording everything by its own camera. But what Boyle really makes is literally put ourselves in Aron's place. Not only doing he a relatable character, thanks to an outstanding performance from Franco, but showing what any human being would do in that situation, since scream, cry, think and then later, hallucinate.The parts of hallucination were (and are) a target of criticism from the public, saying that it is where the film fails exaggerating the story, but it is exactly the opposite. When Boyle focuses attention on those moments of hallucination is exactly when he puts us in Aron's place. I mean, how many times we humble humans are with nothing to do, we imagine situations with ourselves and fill our minds with thoughts and memories. Giving himself a chance to show another magnificent direction, both in the flashbacks and memories, but also making us feel the claustrophobia and asphyxiation of the hole with a beautiful cinematography.In short, ""127 Hours"" is an experience with mandatory viewing at least once in your lives, and believe me, it will be worth it. From a magnificent direction, good script, and (finally) a performance worthy of an Oscar from James Franco makes ""127 Hours"" not only one of the best films of Boyle, but also an unforgettable experience.9/10",127 Hours
182,mdnobles19,-Best film of the year-,10,27 November 2010,"Danny Boyle has outdone himself this time as well as James Franco in a film which to me is hands down the best film of the year, Oscar contenders get ready to be defeated! From beginning to end the movie has energy, creativity, fun and intense thrills and the best one man show since Cast Away. You get invested in this character and relate to him and feel that you are right there with him with his fight for survival and just a heads up for the squeamish that thing get pretty graphic in some scenes and if you read the book you know what I mean. This movie is so inspirational, moving, intimate and makes you want to live life to the fullest and it shows how precious life is, you'll be thankful to be alive and well. The cinematography is outstanding in this and Danny Boyle deserves an Oscar for best director because this is ten times better than Slumdog Millionaire. Overall this movie is flawless to me because it has an amazing true story, a great performance from James Franco, stunning film-work, never dull,slow or predictable it is masterful work! Highly Recommended!!!",127 Hours
183,Monotreme02,Danny Boyle's best film,8,10 November 2010,"There are two main elements that make this story seem like it would never work as a narrative film. Firstly, everyone knows the ending. The film is based on a very widely reported true story that almost everyone seems to know about or at least heard about in passing. And so, must people go into the film knowing how it is going to end. Boyle and company faced a very major obstacle they needed to get over: how will they keep their audience interested in a story they already know the outcome of? In addition, there is the entire notion of dramatic structure. And when you have a story that takes place almost entirely with one character who has his hand stuck under a rock, your dramatic options seem relatively limited. Aside from the one major conflict that is set up very early on, there doesn't seem to be any room for development, further conflict, complications, additional obstacles, or any kind of change whatsoever. The character is quite literally and physically stuck. How do you make this compelling?Firstly, Boyle's visual style does a pretty good job at keeping us interested. Continuing his streak with Slumdog Millionaire, Boyle, along with cinematographers Anthony Dodd Mantle and Enrique Chediak create an absolutely beautiful and rich visual palette, with dynamic camera movements and angles, beautiful framing and use of color, use of different kinds of cameras for different visual styles – consumer-grade digital cameras to get that extreme depth of field and to have objects literally pressed right up against the lens in crisp focus; wide-angle lenses, fascinating point-of-view shots and other elements that all serve to create this incredibly intense and visceral cinematic experience. The vibrant editing also does its job, with very quick, rapid-fire cuts and some of the best and most unique use of split-screen imagery I've ever seen further adding to the film's unique visual style.So how does Boyle create dramatic tension in a movie about a man who spends the entire time with his hand stuck under a rock in an isolated canyon? Easy – he takes us out of the canyon. After the accident, which occurs fairly early on in the story, the film's linear reality begins to fragment, and we begin to see what Aron begins to see. Fascinatingly enough, the film never quite makes it clear what we are seeing are flashbacks, visions and premonitions hallucinated by Aron in his desperate situation, or a combination of the two. The fact that the film blurs these lines makes the experience all the more visceral and puts us even further and deeper into Aron's head. The dynamic style of the film as well as the extremely subjective point of view it puts us in helps to create this inescapable feeling of intensity and dread as the film progresses – it is quite simple one of the most intense and nerve-racking films I have ever experienced. Our connection with the character is so strong and the style so inescapable that even events that we know will happen make us feel nervous and uncomfortable. You really start thinking: there is just absolutely no other way out of this situation, and as this truth becomes more and more obvious to Aron, the feeling of dread only intensifies and intensifies leading up to the horrifically graphic climax. When I first heard about this project, I didn't know if there was anything that could be done. And yet, Boyle and screenwriter Simon Beaufoy found an absolutely brilliant way to get around these problems, and ended up creating one of the most compelling films I have had the pleasure to see this year. By removing us from the canyon, the film ceases to be about a character with his hand stuck under a rock, and becomes a film about the character himself. What makes Aron tick? What happened to him to get him in this situation to begin with, and what does he have inside him that drives him to commit this insanely desperate and courageous act he commits at the end, one which my friends and I deliberated for hours whether or not we would be capable of doing, only to reach the conclusion that there is no way in the world we would be able to do what Aron did if we found ourselves in a similar situation. We see Aron interacting with other people, and pushing them away. We see him leisurely ignoring his friendly boss as he leaves the store he works at before he leaves for his hiking trip. We see him ignoring his mother's phone calls. We see him encounter and have fun with the two hiking girls, only to leave them as abruptly and as nonchalantly as he encountered them. In flashbacks, we see a past relationship Aron shared with a beautiful blonde girl when he was younger, a relationship that ended sourly after Aron wouldn't let her in. Even when we flash back to Aron's youth, we see that his relationship with his family was one of silence. Aron lives in his own world and doesn't let anyone in, and it is this rejection of other people that got him in this situation in the first place. However, it is the change he undergoes in the canyon under the rock as he begins to realize the mistakes he has made and yearn again for the human connection he has lacked all these years that gives him the strength to do what he did. And the shots of large crowds of people that bookend the film lend further poignancy to this notion of human connection that is so beautifully depicted in this amazing and inspirational true story of perseverance and survival.",127 Hours
184,saikatsamanta,A gritty story of life...,8,25 May 2020,"Based on a true story of a man who got his hand crushed under a rock in the canyons and spent 5 days without any help, Danny Boyle directs this film about the indomitable desire of living with artistic prowess.

185,hfreinoso,BOTH amazing and heartbreaking,10,25 August 2020,127 hours is a real life story of Aron Ralston where in 127 hours his arm was stuck from a bolder and HAD to cut his arm off in order to get out of this situation. It was HUGE experience when you watch this film. It was MORE than just an oops situation. I was ALWAYS at the edge of my seat in this film. Every time he does something I begged he got out of his situation. I was really looking forward for him in positive things in his way. But things just get worst and worst. And the arm scene..... was just so hard to watch (even worst than watching a saw trap). You felt for Aron for every second and he was at the end of everything in the film. James Franco did a phenomenal job portraying Aron and I can't praise him enough. This film was in fact what I called breathtaking. 10/10.,127 Hours
186,amirma-78982,"Inspiration, amazing movie",10,24 July 2020,"Best example of what's a human being can achieve even with some tools and things to be survived , actually the human being is a strong creature when he know how to use his mind and power,
Frabco deserved an Oscar for this role because he was amazing",127 Hours
187,toll-8,Franco is the reason this is worth watching,7,7 October 2011,"127 Hours follows the true story of arrogant adventurist Aron Ralston on the biggest misadventure he could come across. He takes a lonely exploring, mountain climbing hike in Blue John Canyon but when he falls on a rock, dislodging it in the process, he finds himself trapped in a narrow crevice with his hand wedged firmly behind this rock.The story follows Aron as he goes through pain, emotional stress, dehydration and hallucinations whilst trapped for five days in this narrow, lonely crack. His only utensils are a bottle of water, which he must ration in order to survive, a cheap utility tool which is nothing short of useless, some rope which isn't much use to a guy who can only use one hand, and a camcorder, which ends up being his prized tool as it is his way of documenting his situation and keeping himself in check with reality whilst he waits for his demise or his emotional blow out. The film manages to ask the question, what would you do? If you know the film, or the story you will know the outcome but again, would you do it?The film is basically served around James Franco, bar a scene at the beginning where he meets two lost girls and shows them the time of their lives (swimming in the depths of a canyon, what else could that mean?) and the people he holds places for in his heart which we see in flashbacks. These are the people and the situations that he believes led him to this crisis, losing the love of his life, ignoring his Mother's phone calls, his constant neglect for telling people where he is going, a lone wolf as he seems to be. It's not until a premonition shows him all that he could achieve in life, the fathering of his son, where he finally makes the sacrifice that others would chose not to. The film is not so much a story as it is an emotional journey with a man whose self belief is so strong that he will do whatever it takes to pursue future moments in his life.The film is generally good due to Franco's fantastic portrayal of Aran, he has you believing all of his pain, all of his anger and remorse. A particular scene is when he interviews himself on a make believe talk show called 'On the Boulder'. The way he delivers his split personality situation is just brilliant and also the final scene where the inevitable happens, where Franco really allows you to feel like you're in his shoes and has you squirming away until he finishes his make or break choice. Franco's performance is top notch but so is most of Danny Boyle's direction. The sound used for pivotal moments, the split screen movements and some of the music are great. It's just a pity that some of the score seems out of place and a few editorial decisions, such as the photograph snapping sequences, seem like they just don't need to be there. It is an area which lets down Boyle initial direction.Although a lot of praise goes into the acting and directing, it is the only thing that makes this film tick. The story seems better suited for a half hour news reel or hour long documentary and it only stretches to the ninety minute mark because of a pointless opening scene with the two girls and an overuse of flashbacks. There was a point in the middle where I was drifting out of the movie as it was becoming a bit repetitive. Of course the movie is moving as it is true but there are not a lot of things you can do with one man in a canyon.The acting is superb, definitely Oscar Winning worthy, the direction was good, the score was up and down and sadly these are the things that really drive this movie. If it wasn't for them then I think this film would dive and it only has seen great reviews because of these aspects. All in all just a good movie and nothing more, unfortunately.",127 Hours
188,El-Ak,That human's damn survival instinct!,8,7 July 2019,"It's a truly hard story to bear as a movie which counts to the film and the director for bringing such a true picture of the story to the screen with the cinematography and the role of Franco's life as he gave his excellent performance.
Thinking of it as a real life story is really brutal and makes you wonder about that instinct and how it can push people over their limits. Everything about the movie is great and it's great score but the overall impression is an 8.5/10 for some editing issues in the slipping of the rock at the beginning of the film scene and some other poor moments of extra suffering. A great film that unexpectedly didn't make me bored seeing a single face 80-90 minutes but
a very harsh one.",127 Hours
189,midas-jacobs,One of the best movies based on a true story.,9,30 April 2016,"Some spoilers might have slipped through, so brace yourself warned!""127 Hours"" is based on the true story of Aron Ralston. Aron is an engineer, who's passion lays more in adventure. So one day he decides that he wants to go, and have some fun in Moab, Utah. But he does this without telling anyone about it, so when his arm get's stuck between a rock and a wall, panic starts to flow..This movie was directed by Danny Boyle. This is also the person who wrote the screenplay for the movie, I love when directors also write the screenplay, this shows their dedication to the movie (in most cases), but more on the screenplay later. He has one multiple movies, and this is the first one that I've seen of him, so I can't really compare with his previous films. In this movie he utilizes a very cool and refreshing style. The three way screen (I think you'll understand what I mean if you've seen the movie), was at first a bit weird, and I didn't quite like it. But as the movie progressed, I started to enjoy and appreciate it more. This can be seen throughout the movie, but the longer parts are in the beginning, and at the end of the movie. I also liked that he used the footage of the camera of Aron. He was also creative at times; by making it look like there was a camera in the tube of his drinking bag. This gave a cool effect. The cinematography was also done very well. This was gorgeous to look at. This was done by two people Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle. The make-up was really good. Which leads me to one of my favorite scenes of the movie. The scene where he cuts of his own arm. I very much enjoyed this part because of the brilliant way it was directed and acted. You could really see the pain, anger and fear in James Fronco's eyes. The wounds looked real, a bit to real as well. But due to the rapid editing you get spared a bit. In most cases I would hate a fast edited part, but here I felt blessed for it :). The cgi was a bit of a downside for me. The bird that flies over looked very cg, just like the upcoming clouds. But the water-bag cgi looked good to me, if it even was cgi.The acting was good, and this is an average, because James Franco was amazing, and the rest, not so much. Not that they were bad, but there weren't great either. So let's start of with the main character. Aron, played by James Franco. In this review I've already said multiple times that he was fantastic, because he was. He showed his acting qualities numerous times during the movie, mostly during the emotional parts. It's just so fascinating that he can convince me so good that he is in pain. Sadly he hasn't really picked good movies recently. There aren't a lot of actors in ""127 Hours"", so I'll just discus Kate Mara, and Amber Tamblyn. First, Kate Mara. She is overall a good actress, just one of her latest movies is not a good one *cough* Fant4Stick *cough*. But she has redeemed herself in ""The Martian"". In this movie she plays Kristi, a girl who is walking in the same place with her friend as Aron. Aron meets them, and befriends them. She was fine. Not her greatest role, but also not her worst. Her friend was played by Amber Tamblyn, and she was fine too. On the rest of the supporting cast I can't judge, because I've seen so little of them.The screenplay is, like I've said, written by the director, Danny Boyle, but also by Simon Beaufoy. The screenplay was very well written. Even though there wasn't a lot of dialogue, they kept me interested and invested with the film. This of course isn't only because of the script, but because of the directing as well. The dialogue, as far as there was some, was good. A thing that some people might find stupid, is that you can see that they are struggling to reach the ninety minute mark. They use lot's of flashbacks, and thoughts, that stretch out the duration of the movie. In some circumstances I didn't mind them. For example the thought of Aron that it started to rain. This just showed how desperate he was to survive, but also heartbroken, near the end. Just that scene alone describes his feelings during the movie. The characters weren't that great developed. Aron kind of was, but it just didn't make me care more about him. The supporting cast wasn't worth to developed, so I didn't care about that they didn't do it. What they do manage to do is to create a starting feeling with Aron. Due to the charisma of James Franco.That was my review for an emotional movie, with very good directing, and a fantastic main actor. 8.7/10",127 Hours
190,austin-takahashi,127 Hours - 5 Stars,10,28 March 2012,"Aron Ralston is currently a known author, public speaker, and mountain climber. Prior to all these achievements, he was a piece of flesh stuck between a rock and a canyon. ""127 Hours"" is the thrilling and horrifying movie about Ralston, his ambition for adventure, his painful accident, his right arm, his will to live, and his cheap, Made-in-China multi- tool.Before Ralston stumbles upon that loose rock, we see him always moving. On his feet, inside his car, riding his bike, the man refuses to stay still, which must have made things all the more difficult for the man who cuts his hair. These moments are accompanied by Danny Boyle's eminent style of directing. I am not sure how to describe it, but it can sure make the sight of James Franco riding a bike feel exhilarating. Through the right use of quick cuts and split screens, Boyle signifies the wild nature of Ralston. He keeps moving, and moving, and moving, until he slips, and comes to a halt.

191,cmoyton,The cult of Danny Boyle,1,28 May 2011,With so much praise heaped on this it almost seems like heresy to criticise 127 hours. However Danny Boyles output is as erratic as any movie director and for some reason like a handful of other directors he can do no wrong in some peoples minds.True story adaptations depicting triumph out of adversity require audience buy in like Alive or The Killing Fields as examples but 127 fails on every level. MTV style directing alert along with the use of split screen as a gimmick on top of which James Franco gives an awful performance . His character comes across as so irritating that after half an hour i A) wanted the film to end and B) couldn't care less about Franco's character (even though like most i knew what was coming) For all the publicity surrounding 127 hours it did not perform so well at the box office. You can also expect to see a lot of unsold dvds on offer nestling between other unsold turkeys like Skyline and London Boulevard when it is released for home entertainment.,127 Hours

The movie not only depicts this horrifying experience in detail but also gives it a spiritual depth by relating it to Ralston's life. Although the movie lacks action, there is no way you can feel bored; Boyle manages to make the situation that Ralston (James Franco) finds himself in so intimate that it will totally consume you. It will amaze you how far the human will could be pushed and challenged. As for James Franco, honestly I've never liked him but I have to admit his performance was amazing and one of his best so far.

193,nagsaptarshi,Triumph of Human Spirit,9,18 June 2011,"Initially I was a bit skeptic to watch another Boyle movie despite being advised by the near and dear ones again and again to watch it.'Slumdog...' is the reason why I was shying away from watching it.Any Hindi movie goer will tell you that they make equal or a better 'Slumdog..' every month or so in India.Yet it created history.And after so many positive reviews on ""127 Hours"" from all over the world, I thought history repeated itself.And boy,I was so grossly wrong in my preconceived notion about Boyle's caliber.Now lets forget the past and concentrate on what we have in the platter.This is by far the most powerful movie on human will power.It is subtle in its promotion of human spirit as we do not see here one man fighting against hundreds or the triumph of the haven'ts against the have's.Its a story of how a mountain climber trapped in a crevice and destined to die, rescues himself by the sheer will power,self induced motivation and finally the shocking way of cutting off one limb.In just one and half hours Aron Ralston's entire life, his agonies, his regrets, happiness,emotions are brilliantly portrayed.But underneath all the hallucinations,dreams or nightmares, the essence is how he keeps going for long 127 hours despite several odds.I will not get into the details any further.Be it the story line, pace of the movie, camera work,direction,art work,music- everything works so nicely here.Looks like Boyle mastered all his resources after the astounding success of the spicy saga 'Slumdog...' to prove his worth as a thinking director.And he succeeds so brilliantly.It would be unfair not to mention other players of this triumphant.James Franco proves that he deserves much more than accolades from the children for his roles in ""Spiderman"".Simon Beaufoy does great work as co-writer of this brilliantly scripted movie.Kudos to Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle for the brilliant cinematography.And watch out for AR Rahaman for the music composition.He again proves that he is one of the greatest musicians alive on earth and by far, the greatest Indian musician.Finally, I would request all of those who have not yet watched this movie or are skeptic about Boyle as I was earlier, to watch it.Watch it when you are down, watch it when things appear to be impossible to you, because in the end of the movie, you will yourself say ""Impossible is nothing"".Undoubtedly it is Boyle's greatest work and one of the best masterpieces of the past decade.Go,watch it.",127 Hours
194,jonnyhavey,The Will To Live,10,7 November 2010,"""127 Hours"" is a film about the real life story about the triumph of a man named Aron Ralston who defying all odds was driven to freedom after spending more than five days trapped with his arm pinned between the narrow canyon wall and an unmovable boulder in a canyon in Moab, Utah. All he had with him was a blunt multipurpose pocket tool, less than a liter of water, a watch, a video camera, a camera, car keys, rope, a sparse amount of food, a harness and the undeniable will to live. The love for his parents and his determination to survive alone drove him to victory. Together award winning director Danny Boyle (""Slumdog Millionaire"") and actor James Franco (""Spiderman"", ""Milk"") have recreated this tale of determination in order to show the world the meaning of the films tagline which states, ""There is no force on earth more powerful than the will to live."" Danny Boyle's cinematic masterpiece will touch and inspire everyone in one way or another. Through flawless cinematography, Boyle documents the five-day struggle of Ralston as he learns about himself and teaches the audience to never give up. Boyle teams up with writer Simon Beaufoy to produce the brilliant adaptation of Aron Ralston's book, ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"" that lights the fire for James Franco's performance. Franco has the best performance of his career with his flawless, heartfelt portrayal of Aron Ralston. Franco reveals the anguish and the revelations that Ralston felt while being helplessly trapped by the power and the magnificent forces of nature. Franco's performance shined the brightest in the most powerful scene in the film. After being trapped for five days he realizes that he had no other choice than amputating his own arm with a dull blade to survive. Franco captures the pain that Ralston felt during this excruciating moment leading to his eventual rejoice and relief. Franco's humbling performance is destined for numerous excellence in acting awards and will bring him to the forefront of the Oscar race for best actor. A performance that has caused audiences to cringe and give standing ovations to what may be the best film of the year.The film really is perfect and is not weak at all. However, since there isn't anything about the film I want to use this section to warn those with weak stomachs that in multiple showings of the film there have been people that have fainted because of the realistic self-amputation scene. Don't let this dissuade you from seeing the film, because the film is by far the best film of the year. Just be ready to look away or cover your eyes during this scene. Just follow Aron Ralston's advice, ""You just have to remember that everything will be okay.""Aron Ralston grew up in the city of Denver and attended Cherry Creek High School. He was just another ordinary thrill seeker who was thrown into an extraordinary situation and the greatest challenge of his life. I recommend to see this film now immediately and as many times as you can. We all need to learn something from this story concerning the importance of priorities because when it comes down to life or death the most important things in ones life are realized. Aron Ralston exemplifies this with his emotional statement, ""Mom, Dad I haven't appreciated you as I know that I could. I love you guys and I will always be with you.""",127 Hours

Not that much happens but it kept me connected all the way through and kept me wondering what was going to happen next. It especially kept me interested on learning more about the character, Aron.The acting was very good and believable. I have to say the best acting performance was the main character. It was also really good to see Clemence Posse something else from Harry Potter.The filming and editing were fantastic. I loved all the unique angles that were used. The editing I thought was very clever with the way some scenes, where things were happening, you get to see it in three different parts.I love Danny Boyle films, such as 28 Days Later, Shallow Grave, Trainspotting etc. And again, he has done brilliantly.

It has some really ghastly scenes but it made the movie more real. You don't see that kinda stuff often, so it's definitely worth a look. James Franco (Aron Ralston) gives his greatest performance ever. This is by far the best acting he has done. A certain Oscar nominee at least.Aron Ralston spent 127 hours stuck in the fault line.

198,montera_iulian,A strong film that paints the road to survival filled with hope and deception,9,6 January 2011,"Danny Boyle deserves all the credit in the world for this directorial achievement. Personally, I think he did an outstanding thing taking on a subject which is hard to put on screen for one hour and half and keep you interested in the character and keep things entertaining: the true story of Aron Ralston, a mountain climber who had to resort to one of the most desperate measures in order to fade death.A profound survival story that doesn't get too melodramatic nor boring or predictable. It challenges the viewer by putting him through the same experience as Aron's thanks to the amazing study of his character and his survival process. 127 Hours entertains by mixing up humor with drama and tense situations. A great journey through Aron's personal experience that goes from his first moments of clarity and then sanity, disappointment and hope, through his hallucinations and premonitions, through his both states of denial and acceptance of the upcoming result and ultimately, through his impressive ambition and desire to live and not accept death as a denouement. James Franco is responsible for caring this movie and make it entertaining thanks to his moving performance. He manages so well to balance his emotional state and ""play"" with his own sanity. His presence on the screen kept the audience in the back of their seats. Speaking of being in the back of the seat, I heard a lot of talk about the ""cutting arm"" sequence which made people fainted or whatever. I expected it to be some gore stuff but it turned out to be more than just OK. It was nothing that harsh to watch... I don't know. Maybe for some really sensitive guys the scene might be a problem but for me it was really nothing that outrageous.Combining the nonconformism in editing with great photography, beautiful landscapes and amazing cinematography 127 Hours stands-out as a striking visually piece of filmmaking. The scenes were cut and put together in an intelligent manor and that majorly helped the movie's pacing. The soundtrack is also one of the best I've heard in a long time. A.R. Rahman is responsible for this beautiful mixture of tribal techno music and uplifting pure melody. The most impressive piece of music I consider it to be within the last couple of minutes right before his ""salvation"" and Dido's vocal performance in the film was destined to make the public to engage emotionally in the movie.127 Hours is another big step in Danny Boyle's career. A strong film that paints the road to survival filled with hope and deception. Carried by a strong performance, by a solid narrative structure and dazzling technical detail, 127 Hours needs to be in anyone's top 10 of 2010.",127 Hours
199,TheHrunting,"Where there's an Aron Ralston, there's a way",8,26 June 2011,"Back in 2003, a thrill-junkie named Aron Ralston, played by James Franco, went out on what he thought was a weekend of fun and games in the remote canyons of Utah but got caught in an impossible situation that put his strength of character to the test. He didn't buddy up with someone, he didn't properly pack and most importantly he didn't tell anyone where he went. Call that irresponsible or call that the life of a risk taker and a gambler at heart. Right out of the gate, Aron shortly acts as a tour guide to two newly met girls, Kristi and Megan, who he treats with a little bit of unsure mysteriousness but know-how for adventure before going off on his own. While climbing down a cavern wall, a medium-sized rock comes loose and Aron falls down with it and gets his hand dislodged against an enclosed wall space, thus starting ""127 hours"" of his struggle.Instead of just doing a quiet, emotion-on-the-face type movie, this switches between and interacts through a portable video camera that Aron talks into towards an imaginary audience similar to ""Grizzly Man."" This mode of interaction transforms the viewer to live and breath the moment-by-moment with the character as opposed to a piece that would look back with a dry and comfortable voice over top. Like the ball with a face in ""Cast Away,"" Aron's camera becomes his friend to converse and reminisce with to bide his time. He's a guy who is used to falling down but always getting right back up again with a few scrapes to talk later about. He has a sense of cheer and humor despite the grim circumstances and won't let negativity get the best of him. He plans, he thinks and he ultimately becomes the situation and makes it routine through his wrist watch keeping time to the various items he brought in his pack to help him survive the best way he can.There's going to be stylish film mechanics to keep things moving, such as frequent camera angles and interspersed music to lend feeling. There's a consistent pacing with ""127 Hours"" that's capable of showing what he went through without making it tedious or over-dramatizing; sometimes even upbeat and at one point philosophical. This can also be candid and straightforward, as well dreamy and sentimental. James Franco transforms this real life person into a likable guy who seems like he is always searching for something and on the move, that is until he got stuck in a predicament of predicaments which brought out every ounce of what perseverance, knowledge and endurance he has in him to either wait and get rescued, beat his body's clock or make a sacrifice.

200,FilmFanatic03,"Dramatic, emotional, disgusting, clever, amazing.....",8,11 January 2011,"Dramatic, emotional, disgusting, clever, amazing. James Franco gave us an Oscar worthy performance as he manages to convey a variety of emotions: comedy, sorrow, anger etc. He carried the film really well. This is like ""I Am Legend"" in how an actor is able to carry the film when it's just him and the film...yet it worked. The emotion and James Franco carried the film extremely well. It was not boring and when he did cut his arm off you couldn't help but look, but the look away again. However i didn't approve of the frequent use of the ""F"" word plus there were a couple of sexual references which i didn't like and prevented me from marking it 10/10. The filmmaking was clever and the editing brilliant. You had those moments when he was alone in the wide open spaces where it was just quite, and long shots of Aron and it just worked! Plus when it rained and he was stuck in the canon the music and the quick editing was very dramatic and built up the tension, but also when he cut his arm off the music kept building up and the various angle shots and the screams from Aron just made you feel all tense inside...it was brilliant, but other little sequences had impressive camera work. The ending is very uplifting and you couldn't help but leave with a smile on your face. Defiently Oscar worthy (mainly for acting, directing, cinematography etc.) Really good!",127 Hours
201,gilligan-11,A remarkable story,9,1 February 2011,"When I heard that Danny Boyle, the director of films like ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" ""28 Days Later,"" and ""Trainspotting,"" was directing ""127 Hours,"" the film adaptation of Aron Ralston's first-person account of his entrapment under a boulder in a Utah ravine and subsequent escape by cutting off his own right forearm, I thought, ""What an odd choice to direct that movie."" Now, after having seen the brilliant ""127 Hours,"" I just can't imagine anyone else having directed the film. Boyle's jerky, spasmodic approach, tempered by long moments of stillness and reflection, paired with the superb music of A.R. Rahman (the same composer who provided ""Slumdog Millionaire"" with its unforgettable score), suits Ralston's story—and his character—perfectly. Of course, James Franco's tour de force performance as Ralston (it's not technically a one-man show, but Franco is alone on screen for the vast majority of the film's 94 minutes) contributes greatly to the film's incredible impact. Boyle and Franco, faced with the challenge of creating drama and tension out of an event that almost everyone watching knows will happen eventually, pull off the task admirably—""the scene"" itself is almost impossible to watch, but somehow we must. By that point in the film, we have so much invested in Ralston's story that we simply have to see how it all happened. Ralston's triumph is so amazing, so remarkable, so inspirational that tears of joy (and yes, relief) will conquer the revulsion most viewers might experience as Ralston amputates his own arm in order to survive. This film is mighty tough to watch, but the reward is well worth it.",127 Hours
202,Maladjusted_1,Effectively simple,8,23 March 2017,"How could a director like Danny Boyle hope to make a film about a man who spent five days with his arm trapped under a rock?This is the question I asked myself when I first heard of '127 Hours', and I asked it again (this time with even greater bewilderment) when I saw how well-received it was. I had numerous opportunities to watch this film over the past six-to-seven years, but I could never convince myself that I'd enjoy it. Then, with little else to watch, I decided to give it a chance. My only regret is that I hadn't given it this chance back in 2010. There are no surprises to '127 Hours' - no twists, narrative intricacies or other film-making favourites. The expression 'What you see it what you get' applies to this film more than almost any other. In spite of that (or *because* of that, perhaps), '127 Hours' is an exhilarating experience.James Franco leads the film, joining a small but competent team of supporting actors. I was recently impressed by Franco's acting in the mini-series '11.22.63', but now consider '127 Hours' to be his greatest performance. He captures both the resilience and desperation of his role excellently, and I doubt that a lesser performer could have handled the lead in a film like this.The visuals are by necessity rather simple, but there are one or two quite memorable scenes, largely due to the sharp camera-work. The editing in the opening and concluding scenes is also commendable.I don't consider this to be the greatest Danny Boyle film, but it's certainly of an expected quality for those familiar with titles like 'Trainspotting'.",127 Hours
203,blackmambamark,"It's not just watching him cutting of his own arm, it's understanding why.",8,14 November 2010,"I have always given high praise to director Danny Boyle. I loved ""28 Days Later"" and ""Sunshine"". But the film he is most famous for, is probably my least favorite. Sorry if i go against the grain here, but i thought ""Slumdog Millionaire"" was just plain okay. It wasn't anything i would go around hootin' and hollarin' about, and it certainly wasn't something i would consider worthy of winning best picture of 2008. Never the less, he is a great filmmaker, and none of his films are ever alike. So i am glad to see that a director like him is tackling something as extraordinary as this story.I'm sure we all remember hearing this story way back when. The man who cut off his own arm to save his life. A human coyote. Asside from the story being very prolific, the question is, can you make a man trapped in a canyon by himself an entertaining picture? The answer here is both yes, and no. While the movie does a great job of explaining and making you understand his ultimate want and desire to cut off his own arm in order to survive, it didn't really create this overwhelming feeling of life. By that i mean, i didn't feeling this desirable urge for him to escape. I wasn't hoping and praying that he would be rescued like i wanted to be. Yes, the movie does create these scenarios, and they are very very good. But let's face it, with a movie like this, you want to be standing on your feet cheering your heart out from the inside.And that really is my only problem with the movie. It really isn't a big one, and it doesn't effect the movie by any means. It's just one of those things that could have been a little better.Other than that, everything else was top notch. Danny Boyle combined with his directing and incredible editing team make this journey both fast paced and emotional at the same time......something very hard to accomplish. But the thing everyone will be talking about is James Franco, who in my opinion, just gave the best performance of his life. I have always praised actors who have nothing around them to work with, and create scenes with their body movements. And James Franco is one of the reasons why i support this belief. Don't be surprised to be hearing his name around Oscar season.Now onto the event that i'm sure everyone wants to hear about, and that is the final arm cutting climax. Now, i have seen some pretty down right and dirty things on film before.......and this is pretty bad. I hardly ever squirm, and i was squirming really hard. I mean, the guy cuts off his arm with a pocket knife, how do you not make it gory? Bottom Line, the movie is easily one of the best i have seen so far this year. No, i don't think this is THE best of the year, but it certainly deserves to be in the ranks of this years top 10. But this movie easily deserves numerous Oscar noms.",127 Hours
204,Marc_Action,127 Hours Wasn't Long Enough,9,13 July 2012,"Brilliant!!!! I'm a fan of James Franco so maybe I could be a little biased but he made this movie. I really believed he was down there trapped in that canyon just like the original Aron Ralston. I also felt like I was right there rooting for him to make it out; right there feeling his pain as that last drop of water dried up and he had to resort to drastic measures; right there during those vivid hallucinations; right there when he made that ""good bye"" video to his family thinking ""this is it!"".Director Danny Boyle did a great job adapting Ralston's near death experience to the big screen; the movie itself based on the New York Times bestseller autobiography, Between a Rock and a Hard Place. Considering a great deal of this movie features only one character, Boyle (along with Simon Beaufoy) worked wonders with the screenplay. As you can imagine, special effects were almost non-existent. I think the only time we saw special effects were during Ralston's brief hallucination spells. The lack of special effects made the film all the more real, and realness is something seriously missing from modern films. Make-up also was on point as at times during the ordeal Franco (as Ralston) looked like the walking dead.There are other actors, and a touching cameo of Ralston and his family at the end, but this movie is all Franco.If you are a fan of survival movies, then you have to see this.",127 Hours

It's the true story of Ralston who found himself stuck in a cave in Utah with his arm pinned under a bolder. I knew much of the story before I watched this film and honestly was a bit queezy as to what might be shown. I'm the sort who does not do well seeing blood and guts and watching this movie was a true test for me. If you are the type of person who gets queezy over stuff like this, I must say view with caution. If you can stomach watching this film, however, you will witness an incredible true story that you will never forget.James Franco is really good in this film. Ralston himself has said the film is very true to what actually happened. It is quite a predicament that he is in and all the thoughts that go through his mind are ones that most would contemplate. What Ralston does to survive this ordeal is unbelievable and something that many if not most people could not force themselves to do. Rating 7 of 10 starts.",127 Hours
206,jnguyen46117,127 Hours: 9/10,9,5 December 2010,"Ask yourself before going into this film, am I prepare to watch a guy cutting off his arm (slowly), am I prepare to see James Franco face throughout the entire film? Well, if you're not, see it anyways. Directed by Danny Boyle and starring James Franco, 127 Hours is really another masterpiece after Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire. With flashy images and colors, Danny Boyle's style is showing up more in his films. 127 Hours is about a guy cutting off his arm. That is the plot, basic and simple. Aron Ralston is a hardcore biker who loves to climb and one day, just as you predicts, he got trapped. Being stuck in between a rock for 5 days with limited food, little water, no heat, and no restroom can really change a person's point of view. Seeing how he survives the five days feels like I'm watching a camping film. But 127 Hours is more than that, it has this hidden feeling that you feel bad for this guy. With his charming personality, James Franco was able to portray Aron Ralston accurately. This guy was really funny throughout the film even though he had to cut off his own hand. But whenever the movie focuses on how Aron survives, it becomes a movie about survival. This film is strictly about the art of cutting one's hand. 127 Hours gathers all the style of Danny Boyle and put it all together. And with James Franco playing the lead, it couldn't have been better.",127 Hours

208,sunraider,"Good book material perhaps, but...",5,5 February 2011,"this film was slow and rather tedious. The best parts of the movie were the first 5 minutes or so, when we see the ""hero"" cavorting in the outdoors amidst beautiful scenery, and the last 5 minutes or so, when the he cuts off his arm to free himself and encounters shocked and horrified hikers. Despite the notoriety surrounding the particular incident depicted in this film, it's still essentially a survival story. That genre isn't exactly new, but the director here fees he has to do something different so instead of focusing on the build-up of the character we get endless, moody flashbacks that are essentially irrelevant and uninteresting and serve only to take us out of the moment. I was somewhat confused as to what exactly the main character did for a living. Did he work in some sporting goods store? If so, why not introduce the character showing him giving good advice to customers (i.e., don't hike alone, tell family and friends where you're going, etc.) and then contrast that with his own rash behavior as he set off alone.And we never see the incident from another's perspective, such as the rescue personnel, the doctors, or even the hikers who discover the injured man. Why not build up the moment when hikers come across the injured Ralston. As audience members, we can never know Ralston's pain and suffering, but we can put ourselves in the place of the hikers who found and helped Ralston. Their shock, horror, and confusion, would be palpable and understandable, but instead those people are just an afterthought. This film focuses entirely on the thoughts and feelings of Ralston, and that's a weakness. James Franco is fine as Aaron Ralston, but the script and the direction lets him down.",127 Hours

I will caution those who haven't seen this movie: if you are looking for a good time in watching a movie, 127 Hours is not what you should watch. It's very emotional, but you won't be getting any spoilers from me, even though this is a true story. Just don't watch it if you have a weak stomach or are prone to fainting.

210,hyder_sagg2003,James Franco makes it ALIVE.,6,8 January 2011,"127 Hours is the latest movie by Danny Boyle (Known for 28 days later, Slummdog Millionaire, Trainspotting, and Sunshine) which delivers fine content. The movie is based on a true story of Aron Ralston who was stuck in rocks for more than 5 days. The story is very fine and editing, cinematography (actual), and Performance by James Franco is excellent and must be given accolades. James Franco has always delivered fine performances in all of his films I have seen.The movie is far from perfection. The direction(which is fine), screenplay and camera handling (OMG what were they thinking? Cloverfeild 2? No offense to anyone but I found that decreasing the quality of the movie, IMO this is the worst flaw of the movie) is not the strongest parts of the movie. Screenplay tries to make intense scenes emotional but fails. Music by Oscar winner AR Rehman is sweet to hear BUT it doesn't actually suits the movie at many sequences, therefore I would not be surprised if it doesn't get Oscar Nomination for Original Score. Screenplay, Simon Beaufy who won Oscar for Slummdog Millionaire again gives a mediocre screenplay (still better than Slummdog Millionaire's Screenplay).Overall, The movie is fine and I don't think that it will get Best Picture Oscar Nomination nor the Best director, Original Score or screenplay Nods.Editing, James Franco are 2 things which IMO will get nominations out of which, James Franco really deserves that.I am gonna rate it 7 out of 10. Interesting true story but flawed due to major contents. we all have seen and Loved ""Into The Wild"" which is also a true story but a far better movie.",127 Hours
211,Supachewy,James Franco Vs. Nature,7,11 December 2010,"The drama 127 Hours is directed by Danny Boyle and starring James Franco, Kate Mara, and Amber Tamblyn. The film takes place in 2003 in Moab, Utah.Aron Ralston (Franco) is a mountain climber who decides to go to the place in Moab, Utah where he has the whole course memorized for his daily thrill. While bike riding, walking, and running around he meets up with two girls Kristi (Mara) and Megan (Tamblyn) and for a short while the three of them go climbing and swimming and all that crazy stuff. Well after the girls leave he gets himself into quite a predicament. While jumping onto a branch he slips and knocks a rock down which crushes his right arm. Oops. The rest of the film is about hallucinations he is having and flashbacks to his family and an old girlfriend. That's why I don't mountain climb, I just write film reviews so I can't my arm crushed.The screenplay by Simon Beaufoy and Danny Boyle was pretty good. This film could have been equally torturous for the viewer as it was for Aron Ralston but it didn't really drag on for the full length of the film, it flowed nicely. The problem with a true story is that the second you go in there you know how it's going to end so the whole time I was like none of this matters I know what's going to happen. I did not see the need to put the flashbacks of his girlfriend in there because it never led up to anything, it didn't even really help with characterization it just showed that Ralston once had a girlfriend but now he's trapped in a canyon. The dialogue for the whole of the film was very believable, usually when one person is talking to themselves it doesn't work out very well but here it works very nicely.Danny Boyle had some pretty stylized direction on this one, and it helped keep the film entertaining throughout. Is this film as good as his previous, Slumdog Millionaire? No. Personally I believe Boyle's best film to be Trainspotting which also had a lot of style and I think Boyle is much more comfortable with stylistic films than something which cannot have a stylistic influence upon it. I like how Boyle does films in multiple genres: Slumdog Millionaire-fantasy, Trainspotting-crime, 28 Days Later-horror, Sunshine-science fiction, and 127 Hours-real life drama. All of Boyles directing decisions I think were fine with this film, the only reason I couldn't give it a higher score is because the story is very limited to a guy trapped in a rock and he couldn't really put in any crazy mind games to add another layer of interest.James Franco easily gave the best performance of his career so far and it would be shocking if he did not receive an Oscar nomination for Best Actor at this year's Academy Awards. Will he win it? I highly doubt it. In the film Aron Ralston is fun, carefree kind of guy who climbs mountains to just to have a good time. When he gets trapped he starts to lose hope and his mind a bit. The part where Franco delivers his best in the film is when he is pretending to interview himself because it just shows how low he has gotten. This is the first time Franco has ever really been in a lead role, I know him mostly for his supporting roles in Spiderman and Pineapple Express, but as a lead man he is very impressive and has a bright career in front of him.The only real supporting cast in this film was Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn as the two girls Ralston meets before he gets trapped. Both girls did a fine job but nothing really noteworthy. They were basically just average girls who are just following a path for fun. There wasn't really enough acting in the flashbacks to criticize but none of them were bad enough to notice.Overall I give this film a 7/10, the only reason I couldn't give it higher was because the script was very limiting and I already knew how it would end since it is a famous story. If you like films like Into the Wild or other man vs. nature type films then you would like this one as well. Franco and Boyle both have very bright careers for the future even though they both had very successful careers before this Franco will make his way as a leading man and Boyle will still be one of the best directors of today.",127 Hours
212,intern-88,"A kind of Eat, Pray, Love for men",10,21 June 2012,"'We were going to make an action movie in which the hero can't move', said director Danny Boyle of his latest movie 127 Hours, treating its completion as something of a challenge. Boyle needn't have worried; heading a team drawn from his earlier productions, he delivers a punchy, convincing and watchable piece of work. (Rodrigo Cortés got there last year with Buried, a taphephobic thriller trapping Ryan Reynolds in an underground box. And film purists will say Hitchcock did it with Rear Window.) Fortunately, cinematography and sound design help to create enough variety around likable protagonist James Franco for the movie not to seem like being trapped in a canyon for 127 hours.Adapted from Between a Rock and a Hard Place – a memoir by Aron Ralston – the film concerns the five-day period when, following a freak accident, a young climber's right hand was pinned by a falling boulder. Since no one knew of Ralston's whereabouts, starvation and dehydration loomed even though the pain of the injury had subsided. In print, Ralston's involuntarily immobility is an opportunity to reflect on his past life and mistakes; the movie uses condensed flashbacks, which mean Ralston's personal reflections seldom displace the more practical issue of survival. Despite these differences, book and film alike act as unwitting barometers of certain changes in society's values.The opening images reveal huge crowds on the move, combining what could be footage left over from Slumdog Millionaire with a basketball game at Utah Jazz's EnergySolutions Arena. Quite deliberately, this creates a contrast between the heaving multitudes of modern life and the solitary virtues of the wilderness. By showing rather than telling, Boyle lets us work this out by ourselves – which comes as a relief, compared to equivalent passages in Ralston's autobiography. In both film and book, the central narrative – trapped man has to go to extremes to escape – grabs the imagination.Ralston's memoir shows him embracing the outdoor life and abandoning a conventional career. Trained as an engineer, he focuses on the weekend – athletically hiking and attacking canyons and mountains with vigour – until the weekend's activities take priority completely. Eventually Ralston downsizes to working in a climbing gear shop and as a rescue volunteer because that is what he wants to do: 'because it's there' is the rationale for his outdoor activities. 'Climbing fourteeners in the winter by myself wasn't just something I did; it became who I was', he writes.Ralston writes of human estrangement from nature, all the while revealing his estrangement from other humans. For Boyle, there's no need to spell this out as ploddingly as the book does; instead it is implied, by cutting back and forth between beautiful landscapes and Ralston's claustrophobic surroundings, or between a crowded screen and the isolated figure cut by Franco throughout his restrained performance. The protagonist's estrangement from friends and relatives ends up played out into a half-hallucinated domestic world in which the dying Ralston makes (and videotapes) his apologies. Boyle has been accused of misanthropy before, as in his pseudo-zombie fest 28 Days Later, but here the disdain for humans seems to be more Ralston's message, whose ordeal could be seen as a realistic personal apocalypse.It is no spoiler to say that Ralston escaped by cutting off his right forearm. Indeed, among various commentators the shorthand – no pun intended – is to call this 'the amputation scene'. 'If you don't mind, I'm going before the arm', one squeamish critic told the receptionist at the press screening I attended. Those who stuck around witnessed a realistic looking scene where mobility is regained by hacking through flesh with a blunt multi-tool – one of those steel knocks-off of the Leatherman multiknife, handed out as freebies at petrol stations. Not only are they useless for chipping away at boulders, but, as audiences will see, they are also completely unsuitable as surgical instruments. Given the annual popularity of the Saw franchise, it is not impossible that this gruesome 'money shot' will be one of the things bringing people into the multiplexes and scooping up the pirate DVD in pubs, especially since improvements in prosthetics and digital effects are such that surgical scenes have acquired greater verisimilitude in the past decade.More seriously, the film has the universal appeal of making one ask 'what would I do in that situation? How far would I be prepared to go?' For this generation, more distant from the horrors of warfare and taught that the body is a temple, the loss of a hand is about the worst thing that could happen, unless bigger body parts were to be amputated and left under a rock. All this should perhaps prompt some reflection on how body horror got so mainstream.127 Hours ends – more or less – in a rescue, showing starkly some of the benefits of modern life. A black helicopter gets Ralston out of the wilderness and into hospital, not a snow-white ptarmigan. Accidents aside, Ralston's commitment to nature (and its capture on film by Boyle and team) is possible precisely because of us living in a developed society, with other people chipping in their skills towards his care and rehabilitation and, more recently, to back up his continuing career as a mountaineer.If filmed ordeals, body horror and wilderness worship all combine to make this inspiring tale of survival into a message of the moment, so too does the rise and rise of Ralston himself. 'My accident and rescue from Blue John Canyon were the most beautifully spiritual experiences of my life', his book concludes – a kind of Eat, Pray, Love for men. That Ralston stepped out of hospital and on to a treadmill of talkshows and the high-priced motivational speaking circuit makes him quite a typical accidental celebrity for our times.",127 Hours

Of-course each director is different but Danny Boyle has his own style that separates his films from others even if the story is may not be truly original. It's his style that makes 127 Hours a great film because there are so many ways that you can tell the story but he brings a sense of energy to the film that would not have been present if another director had made this. Similar to Cast Away, the film really does focus on the lead character, played by James Franco who is brilliant and deserved his Oscar nomination. He encapsulates the adrenaline fueled explorer perfectly where no mountain is too high for him and more importantly you like him. Its easy to sympathise with someone in the position that he finds himself in but his personality adds something to the film.What also makes the film stand-out is the cinematography and editing that can really pump up the tension. The film starts off colourful where everything is bright and full of life but by the end, the image has become dry as the hours build up.127 Hours is a film worthy of your attention.

218,PopCulturedwithMovieMike,Pulse-pounding tale of survival,9,29 January 2014,"127 Hours is an intense, edge-of-your-seat film that never fails to capture your attention even though most of the movie revolves around one person. Just in case you've been living under a rock (pun intended), 127 Hours tells the true story of Aron Ralston, played by James Franco, a free spirited adrenaline junkie who literally finds himself trapped between a rock and a hard place while exploring the Blue John Canyons in Utah. Although most of the film centers around Ralston, it never lags and this is mainly attributed to director Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire). As if we didn't already know, Boyle proves that he is one of the most impressive directors working today. By using flashbacks, dream sequences and hallucinations, 127 succeeds in holding your interest the whole time. Also, his use of multiple split screens help keep the film visually interesting. Another credit goes to James Franco, who gives the performance of his career as Ralston. It's not an easy task to be the only actor on screen, but Franco triumphs in every way possible. Franco portrays every emotion Ralston must have gone through while trapped; anger, sadness, and guilt, sometimes all in the same scene. Ralston also manages to keep his sense of humor, mainly as a defense mechanism to keep from going insane. While trapped, Ralston keeps a video diary of his every move and thought. Often telling us what time it is and how much water he has left. He also records messages to his family, and this is where much of the heart of the film really is. Although I knew the outcome of the story, I never felt that Ralston was safe. His life constantly feels in peril and it's not until the camera zooms out from Ralston's place of captivity, that we truly realize how alone he really is and how there is zero hope of anyone finding him. If he is to survive, he must do it on his own. This is one of the main themes throughout the film, Ralston's yearning to be by himself. The beginning of the film opens with images of crowds of people at various events. Ralston wants to escape this hectic lifestyle so bad that he doesn't even tell anybody where he's going. Many people would compare 127 Hours to films like Castaway and Open Water, although it doesn't really fit. In Castaway, Tom Hanks had a whole island to explore. In Open Water, there were two characters. 127 Hours can most closely be compared to Buried (also released this year) staring Ryan Reynolds who is trapped in a coffin. I don't really see why 127 Hours isn't a film for everybody to enjoy. Sure, there is a particular scene that is hard to watch. It's handled with the perfect amount of screen time without making it seem gratuitous, but at the same time, giving it the treatment it deserves in order for it to feel real. During this seen, I could feel the audience squirming in their seats, accompanied by audible groans. The music in this scene is loud and pulsing and many times screeches to deafening decibels in order to convey the anguish that Ralston is going through. We are lucky to have a film like 127 Hours get a wide release, unlike the aforementioned Buried, which never really saw the light of day. Hopefully people will go see it, proving to studios that people don't mind watching a film that is basically carried by one actor.",127 Hours
219,dholliday-imdb,film's production is too stylish,6,21 April 2015,"Coming off the similar but very sparse Open Water (8/10) I found the hyper-stylised production of 127 Hours quite jarring. What works in urban culture ensembles like Trainspotting doesn't necessarily fit with a solo-survival story.You've got 'trendy' music (sounds outdated already) all over the place, digitally-enhanced zooming and hectic edits which reminded me of Quantum Solace in that you couldn't quite follow the action. Even the famous epiphany scene wasn't as clearly-directed as it should've been (apparently Boyle wanted it to be, so maybe he should have a word with his editor).On top of all that there's a hyper-active cowboy as the main character who's an überwired I-LOVE-LIFE sort, effortlessly making couch potatoes like me feel guilty. Just check out the slide into the idyllic pool scenes with the girls at the beginning, surely it was only a matter of time before one of them bashes their head against the wall on the way down? I internally grumped ""you were asking for that, kid"" when he got stuck between a rock and a hard place. But it's not a bad film, to be fair it's pretty decent and most of it is an accurate depiction of what really happened. Franco plays the part very well, and aside from the over-stylising I quite liked the camera work, admittedly some of the drink-fantasy scenes were fairly dynamic to behold (the flooding and quick dash to his girlfriend's front door was well done).Just that personally I like a film of this nature to be sparse & minimal. In Open Water I felt the fear, whereas in 127 Hours my drama-tingles weren't really tingling, perhaps because my senses were often busy with processing audio & visual tricks.Recommended if you like Danny Boyle's style regardless of genre, but if you want a tense & involving survival thriller this could go either way.",127 Hours

The movie is paced in a manner which makes the audience take the role of Aron or any other person in such a situation and gives them the chance to rethink their options and when the audience are at the verge of getting bored with a thought,the movie throws another challenge at them. It certainly does not tax the audience's minds but rather gets them more involved onto the film.Movie has got brilliant cinematography and excellently paced soundtrack which brings every scene in the movie alive and real.Please stick to cinemas or the least HD home formats while watching the movie for any other medium dampens the manner in which the movie has been delivered. The Movie might not turn out to be an epic and have a cult following but it is,a very brilliantly shot cinema and a celebration of the human spirit which indeed needs to be celebrated!

The movie is about an adventure of mountain climber Aron Ralston(James Franco), which badly goes wrong. He gets trapped in crack of great canyon under a boulder which badly pinches his right hand to the rock wall and the situation became nigh impossible to free that hand out. Then Aron has to spent almost 5 days in that hole with very limited resource, the movie travels through Aron's various emotions and futile attempt to get rescued.The movie is all about Aron and thus the performance belongs to James Franco. He is brilliant through-out the movie and specially in the scene where he records a mock talk show featuring himself in his video camera.A.R.Rahman's music is also quite good ( though not one of his greatest).Overall it's an inspirational movie and definitely a well deserved Oscar nomination for this movie.",127 Hours

If you don't know who Ralston is then the ending might be a big surprise to you. It's quite inspiring and superior. Anyways the filmmaking was obviously decent. Danny Boyle's directing is a little bit overrated. Then the strong performance of James Franco. ""127 Hours"" is a movie that you already know what it's going to be.This can be called ""Buried"" with flashbacks and origins of the incident. ""127 Hours"" is non-fiction and Danny Boyle wanna show the real gore that happened. Which is a good thing. Boyle is using his same old directing style but now it has montage and some product placement. James Franco's performance was pretty strong and the cinematography is definitely good.Danny Boyle's movies are usually overrated but it is still entertaining though. It's definitely worth watching but you might get disappointed if you are expecting something enormous. ""127 Hours"" is a plain Danny Boyle movie and again it's obviously decent.",127 Hours
223,ticket_for_one,I have a new found respect for James Franco!,10,24 January 2011,"Incredible film! This has been doing the rounds in a the States and almost all critics have said that this was either their favourite film of last year or one of their favourites. Well I'm jumping on the American critic bandwagon and I'm also saying that 127 Hours has been noted as a film of the year contender! So early you say, well watch it first and you'll see what I'm talking about! It's not just about a man's terrible accident and the situation he finds himself in. No, it's way more than that! I found myself emotionally invested in the film. I experienced a roller-coaster of emotions whilst watching this. Imagine being trapped in a canyon unable to move because your arm is stuck. Then having to make the life or death choice to remove that arm so you can be free. I have a new found respect for James Franco! The man has come a long since playing James Dean and Harry Osborn from the Spiderman movies. He was absolutely brilliant in this! He's brilliant in every scene! Utterly believable as Aron Rolston! There's a scene where Franco's character video tapes a goodbye message to his folks and thanks them for all the years they spent together as a family. A really touching scene!Throughout the film we experience his dreams, his past experiences, his nightmares and his hallucinations. It's all part of the journey we are taken on, because of this unfortunate accident. The last 10 mins are the most intense! But at the end you'll either cry, cheer, laugh or smile. That's if you haven't fainted after or during the infamous arm cutting scene. As for Danny Boyle, I honestly say he's out done himself here. If I'm being honest, I hated Slumdog Millionaire! And it should never have garnered the praise it did. But this is truly a wonderful film and his careful eye for visuals and ear for sound really make this a memorable movie going experience. The soundtrack! The soundtrack by A. R. Rahman is awesome! Expect 127 hours to be nominated for a number of awards this year. Best Actor, Director, Original Soundtrack and Best Film. This should get an extended run in cinemas because of the awards season. I implore you to watch this on the big screen! You will not get the same connection I got with the film if you wait for DVD or Blu-Ray! A truly wonderful cinematic experience! GO SEE THIS NOW!!!",127 Hours
224,xtian_durden,Danny Boyle's first 10/10 for me.,10,7 February 2011,"Do I believe in fate? I don't know, but Aron Ralston do, he accepted the fact that that rock stuck on his arm is waiting for him all of his life. We tend to think a lot more when we are stuck with life itself. Aron Ralston had so much to think in what he thought was his last days. He thought of that party he was invited by the last two people he saw, he thought about his memorable and happy days with his family, he blamed himself, for being selfish and for being stuck there, well he can't blame the rock. He had so much time to think that he felt guilty of some of the things he took for granted. Well, that's what we're going to feel when we're helpless and waiting to die on our own mistake. Danny Boyle, after his Slumdog Millionaire won the best picture two years ago, had come back with another brilliant film, but in a different set of standards, for me this is his best so far. This is not boring, considering one location and one actor present on almost the whole duration of the film. That's not only because of Danny Boyle's techniques but also because of James Franco's outstanding acting, he's best performance of his career. He plays the cocky athlete who lived to tell his agonizing experience. It is a torture both to the audience and to Ralston throughout the film. When the fact that he's not going to be saved by anyone became clear to him, he is faced with two choices: Lose your arm or lose your life? He's got the courage to live and he deserved to be alive today. Maybe he was meant to be in that situation for him to start a new life, a more cautious life. In his first attempt of cutting his arm, I was thinking: Don't do that, that's nasty and real painful, there's no way that that tool will gonna cut it, just wait for somebody. But the second time he tried it I really knew he was going to do it, it's sickening and disgusting but there's no other option. I can't imagine myself in that situation, because it's hard to lose any part of our body, especially the arm, especially when you're the one doing it. He had no third choice, time is a factor, he had to let go of his arm rather than letting go of his life. After watching this film, I thought that life is beautiful just to let it go when you've got a choice to keep it. You've got to give credit to James Franco, he played it with the confidence of his character and with a convincing detail. I haven't seen yet the performance of the two actors nominated in this year's Academy Awards, Javier Bardem in Biutiful and Colin Firth in The King's Speech, so right at this moment I have to say that James Franco did better than Jesse Eisenberg and Jeff Bridges, but Colin Firth has the upper hand because he had already won on the Actors Guild and Golden Globe. I have to see The King's Speech as soon as possible, so that I can know who I'm going to support. But talking about courage, Aron Ralston got a heavy dose of it, as he continues to do the thing that makes him happy, mountain climbing. No pain, no gain.",127 Hours

227,sheepmonk2000,127 Hours went by in a breeze,8,19 June 2011,"This film went by in a breeze and that of course is down to Danny Boyle's excellent and provocative screenplay and the brilliant and snappy way in which he edits this film with some vibrant colours and one incredible central performance from James Franco. Going into this movie I was a little sceptical to say the least due to the fact it was trying to tell what I believed to be quite a short story in a whole 90 minutes. However, the film doesn't just deal with the self amputation of the main characters arm (which is filmed tastefully, whilst remaining realistic at the same time), but also the events leading upto and after the pivotal plot point, with regular flashbacks involving the character's life when not trapped under a boulder and also his hopes and dreams once released. Therefore, the film doesn't drag, plus there was lots of bustling conversation between my family and my self when watching this film revolving around the many different ways in which he does try to free himself and the inevitable discussions about how or what we would do if placed in a similar or the exact same situation ourselves. All in all, this a film with great acting, terrific pacing and a satisfactory ending resulting in no doubts sounds of enormous relief from those who are lucky/wise enough to check this film out...I did and was overjoyed with the final result. 8/10 (4*)",127 Hours
228,nEoFILM,Probably the best that it could have been...,6,31 October 2011,"Danny Boyle is a director with an eye for the modern. visceral styles, sharp editing and the belief that the combination of both will draw the audience into the action, emotion and mood of the situation at hand. There's no doubt that the stunning true story of adventurer Aron Ralston's accident resulting in his right arm becoming trapped under a rock in the middle of nowhere, required a special director and a style as described above.Did he pull it off? It's a though sell, 90 minutes of a man and rock but I think it was done about as well as it could have been. The story is interesting and told with a sense of humour and a philosophical attitude appropriate for the subject matter, but it all boils down to the moment when he performs his DIY surgery, a plot point that may well sell the film to most people, as it sold news papers back in 2003.Overall, well told, very well acted by James Franco as Ralston and along with Boyle's signature direction and jukebox soundtrack, whilst not blowing my skirt up, it made my wife cry, myself cringe and was as well conveyed as this story of a man trapped quite literally between as rock and hard place, ever could have been.",127 Hours
229,IMDBcinephile,A Decent Movie,7,5 July 2011,"I have to admit off the bat that I'm not part of a big fan base when it comes to Danny Boyle. He's made movies that were valuable to my collection, but he never seemed to give me any emotional resonance or even that much extensive thought after his movies were over; you hit play and then subsequently when it's over you press off and don't even have a second's thought.Here, I rented this with not a lot of tentativeness, even though I wasn't a disciple of Boyle beforehand; but James Franco gave a better than expected performance (I have to admit from ""Milk"" (2008) he never really impressed me and I didn't really have any empathy for him; I found him dull and one dimensional; that's not saying he didn't do well, but he didn't do AS well as I would have thought).The movie is on a true story, and I was then hooked to the idea of watching it; the beginning is already giving you catalysts of the need for water; it was moderately interesting how the three sights on screen were sometimes edited together in a sinew of images, like Franco (Aron Ralsto in the movie) going past a McDonalds joint and drinking on the way; initially, you notice a tap dripping, dripping and dripping... the only place left where he could fetch water.However, he still has the teenager and reckless life style, and yet is still extremely lively as a human being. He meets these two girls, and he shows them the sites of Utah.Boyles' cinematographer gives the landscape great width, predictably and uninhibited crane moves into the field of it; however, it does not add much to the story, but it is still immensely enticing to gaze at. We get a full glance at the area that Aron climbs regularly.And of course, Franco falls into the cave, and his hand is stuck underneath a rock; I would have thought that the whole thing would be boring after that, and then I was immersed into the common, yet fascinating back story of his life, and how he copes in the whereabouts with such little advantage; it grinds on the visceral and nostalgic and hopeful future that compels one man without any help to go way and beyond. It does have some shocking bits, but all in all, it can be dampened with the chopping and pretenses that he is about to do it, and then stopping. Also, I feel it is heavily inspired by Aronofsky's editing style, where the water is involved (the only thing he can drink) and then it may shoot a trivial and important thing at the same time, like the juice from his car. However, my favorite bits were definitely when he exchanged his sorrows so that he could replenish his hope, like telling his Mum he's sorry he didn't answer her or how he was unable to attend her Sister's Wedding and so on; he does this in a humorous and moving way. I also love how his camera is constantly being used; however that was rather mind boggling because you're wondering ""Why is this guy using his camera within such a limited time of survival?""... at least he wanted to document his last times, but he doesn't even take the camera with him when he escapes... However, the camera is there for his comfort as well; it's his only tool that could have been his last means of communication - there was also a scene where his face is in three frames concurrently through the camera, however this is not important.The charm to it is that everything he sees and feels in his state becomes his only instinct - he yearns for the open area just like any man would and yet he does it with some pretty savage consequences. The movie even beguiles you at one point with how he gets out in a sequence! It is important to note that the story doesn't have a moral and in fact the ending is possibly not going to gel with everyone and that was it really.So my last thoughts on the movie are that Boyle has set up a surface and a peregrination for the viewer; he may then take it away for the character to be developed but I am certain that the most powerful elements are definitely the cautionary thought and careful consideration of one man forsaken and then impelled to the edge. The movie does run its course eventually, though, but it's safe to say the scene where he saves himself was worth the wait in the way it was shot with sufficiently mind altering effects... we are then free and so is he! That's the brilliant thing about the movie despite minor flaws with its timing and the characters bold and unidentifiable way... and then you see him develop and you're moved by it.",127 Hours
230,shashikrishna,An interesting watch,8,9 February 2011,"'127 Hours' by Danny Boyle is based on the true story of climber Aron Ralston who ventured into the gorgeous Blue John Canyon in Utah back in 2003. He had not informed anyone where he was headed and wasn't carrying a mobile phone either. While there, he runs into two girls who seem a tad smitten with this carefree, risk-taking, self-confident young man. Their admiration for him extends to them inviting him over to their party that's taking place later that night. Aron tells them he'll be there and heads on further.Just moments later, Aron's tryst with fate begins. While exploring a dangerous canyon drop, he trips and falls. What falls along with him is a now dislodged boulder that ends up jamming his right arm firmly against the wall of the canyon. It is the moment this happens, that the look on Aron's face (played by James Franco) changes colors instantly. This incident takes place about 15 minutes into the movie and it is then that the credits read – '127 Hours'.Aron is now trapped hopelessly. His lung busting screams are to no avail in that uninhabited wilderness of rocks and dust. With an extremely limited supply of food and water, Aron now has to figure out a way to get out of there. He has to gather his thoughts by constantly reminding himself not to panic and carefully plan his escape. He has to figure out what he will take, and more importantly, what he will leave behind. Either he can die there with all his limbs intact or get out of there by making some tough – extremely tough - decisions. With just a blunt pocketknife to help him make this life altering move, Aron begins his battle to stay alive.The title of the movie is essentially about two things – one, about the duration of his ordeal in that cave and two, about the time he needed to make the choices he eventually ended up making. Somehow, the second aspect mentioned here seems the primary focus of the story. It is in these 127 hours that Aron sees images from his past, present and future as he hallucinates back and forth between his family, ex-girlfriend and friends. He records all the goings on via his digital camcorder and camera including some confessions. He even etches a crude obituary to himself on the cave's wall convinced that he'll probably not make it out of there alive. But is this really what he truly believes? Or would he rather snap his arm against the cave's wall and chop it off to break free?The film isn't violent per say yet has a beautiful poetic shade of human suffering. There is something both entertaining and tragic to watch a rational human being trapped mercilessly under a boulder. While it certainly highlights just how vulnerable humans really are, it also acts as a reminder that there is no such thing as a 'lifeless nature'. Aron's monologue as to how that boulder – possibly a product of billions of years of formation – was just waiting for the day the two would meet, truly highlights the core essence of the story. It is a test of his willpower in the face of nature's little gauntlet that has been thrown at him. It is also a reminder to the rest of us that nothing is ever permanent. Even something as simple as a drop of water can sometimes become the only reason for our desire to live. This reminder, more than anything else, is the true horror of '127 hours'.James Franco is brilliant as Aron Ralston. Despite the physical constraints of being stuck in one single position for most of the movie, James brings to the screen a wide plethora of emotions which make us feel with him, fear with him, empathize with him and finally, root for him. Boyle excels in this form of storytelling where a piece of rock ends up becoming such an integral part of the narrative. Visually, the film captures the rocky mountains splendidly as does the apt soundtrack by AR Rahman. It is this juxtaposition of human fragility against a product of billions of years, that makes 127 hours a memorable, relevant and inspiring watch.",127 Hours

233,italo505,Between a Rock and a Hard Place,7,30 April 2012,"I watched this movie yesterday after having heard so much about this guy's adventure in the Utah's Canyonlands National Park where Aron Ralston (James Franco) had made his routine to venture all on his own and jump from rock to rock in his bike, carelessly defying death with every move he made.It's exhilarating to watch this daredevil and seeing how he breathes danger and nature, he loves this place so much that he's almost forgotten about the rest of the world, it's like he's become a loner who enjoys his time more when he's alone in the wild than when he's around his family. Yet he records every moment along the way with his camcorder and camera, he chronicles his journey as if he just wanted everyone to live through his every adventure and be able to tell the story: I survived this, I survived that...After parting ways from a couple of very attractive young girls who were lost in the wilderness of this beautiful and astonishing park, Aron decides to take a shortcut back to his truck in order to get ready to party with these girls later on that evening. There's all these cracks in the mountain that allow very little space to go through it, it's like being caught inside a giant maze where there's no safe way out unless you're as experienced as Aron is. His confidence allows him to jump as a jaguar from rock to rock without care... Until the unthinkable happens.He falls along with a giant boulder that pretty much smashes his hand and forearm and traps him in the middle of nowhere. His initial reaction is to scream for help but as the camera zooms out we realize it's almost impossible for anyone to hear him. He's literally caught between a rock and a hard place as his self titled book is called and he must find a way to chip away from this boulder to free his hand and arm from the boulder.What I most liked about the movie is not so much the fact that he had to resort to drinking his own urine, or the fact we were witnessing a man severing his own arm to liberate himself and find his way back home. It's more interesting to focus in what was going through his mind while he was trapped all this time alone in the freezing cold temperature, suspended up in the air with little food and water to sustain himself. I think what came through at the end was a man who recovers himself, a person who's forced to look at himself and see how selfish he's been, how he's shut out everyone in his life to pursue these adventures. He was destined to fall at that precise time, in that precise place as he himself describes it: ""You know, I've been thinking. Everything is... just comes together. It's me. I chose this. I chose all this. This rock... this rock has been waiting for me my entire life. It's entire life, ever since it was a bit of meteorite a million, billion years ago. In space. It's been waiting, to come here. Right, right here. I've been moving towards it my entire life. The minute I was born, every breath that I've taken, every action has been leading me to this crack on the out surface."" Aron Ralston Sometimes, we have to go through a tragedy, a harrowing experience of this kind to realize how precious our lives are. As Aron was cutting through his arm in his last attempt at making it out of there alive a vision of his unborn child was presented to him. People may not believe this is a sign that God exists, but Aron did. There are moments in one's life where we have to stop and thank Him for opening our eyes, if just for a little bit, to realize how much we are loved and appreciated and how we depend on others and how others depend on you.On more than one occasion I have stopped and thought: what would have happened if I hadn't gone there, if I hadn't taken the chance, if I hadn't listened... Where would I be? I thank God that I had a chance to open up my eyes and see what was in front of me, kick myself in the ass and move on with my life... God works in very mysterious ways and it's in the darkest moments that we find the light.We all carry this boulder on our shoulders, we just gotta know when to let it go...",127 Hours

236,MovieGeekBlog,Style over substance?,7,8 November 2010,"For some reason I keep on comparing this film to ""Buried"": the concept and the scope of both films is pretty much the same. One person stuck in a confined place for the whole length of the film. But while in ""Buried"" the director was able to keep the entire film inside the box and never ""cheated"" by giving the audience flashbacks or shots of whatever was happening in the outside world, here in ""127 Hours"" director Danny Boyle uses every trick in the book to make the visual more exciting and sometimes to the expense of the emotional response that one should have for a story of this kind. Split screens, speeded up/trippy sequences, long zooms out from a tiny close up of James Franco's face to the widest view of the Canyon. Surely it makes it all exciting to watch, yes the photography is beautiful (2 different Directors of Photography were used for this film. And by the way that first bicycle riding sequence is really breath-taking), yes the editing is as flashy as it can be (in fact I think it's easier to produce showy editing of this kinds than proper invisible one But then again, wait and see how this one will win the Oscar), but when it comes to getting really close to our main character, knowing his history, his background, his life, that's when the film fails for me. Listening to a Q&A sessions with the makers at the end of the film, I was actually intrigued to hear about the real story and I started longing for a documentary about it Hold on a second Would I need a documentary if the film had satisfied me completely? It's really not James Franco's fault! He gives the performance of his career and I can easily see an Oscar nomination coming his way, the problem is that Boyle is so preoccupied about whizzes and bangs, about his visual flashy style and about making you feel so trapped like the main character has, that he forgets what the story (and the original book) was really be about: a cathartic experience about a man who's accepted his own death and looks back at his life realising all the mistakes he's done. In the end it just becomes a story about the power of self preservation. It's absolutely not a bad film, but this one could have been so much deeper and fuller, at least to match the fullness of the visuals (and its soundtrack too, I should add, as always in a Boyle's film, was very accomplished). People will love, I'm sure about that, but I really wanted a masterpiece out of this one, like the trailer made it look like.

A story of remarkable human resilience, Boyle and star James Franco make an involving and personal film about a man versus the elements.The film tells the true story of Aron Ralston, a professional rock climber. On this particular weekend, he decides to go to the desert without telling anyone where he is going. After biking for 17 miles, he runs into two girls—the last people to see him while he still had his forearm. After going their separate ways, Ralston continues hiking through canyons. While going into one, a boulder slips from under his feet and his right arm becomes pinned between the boulder and the wall of the canyon. This is where the movie really begins.Essentially a one man show, James Franco gives the best performance of his career as the man caught between a rock and a hard place. His slow descent into hopelessness, madness, and finally, assertiveness, is sadistically fun to watch. Even if it is hard to sympathize with a cocky rock climber, as the movie progresses. Franco's character becomes more and more identifiable, eventually coming to embody any one of us who has gone through painful decisions and excruciating circumstances. Franco gives his character a mixture of warmth, strangeness, and—when he cuts his own arm off—complete baddass-ness.Danny Boyle gives it his all with this brutal account of survival. It's a hard thing to get right, making a movie that almost entirely takes place in one small spot; but Boyle triumphs. The bloody and gut- wrenching amputation scene will have even the most jaded movie goer squirming in their seats. Yet, what makes this movie great is the warmth and sentiment Boyle places at the heart of this film. Our character looks back on his life, family, and ex-girlfriend. And he even has a vision of his future son. Boyle is able to take a bleak and bitter tale of survival, and turn it into a glorious film of hope and beauty. The movie is beautifully photographed by Anthony Mantle, with saturated colors that almost engulf us into the desert.Still, the film belongs to Franco. His Oscar-worthy performance is the centerpiece of 127 Hours. Although Boyle sometimes strays into predictability, and the arbitrary split-screen editing is unnecessary at best, the movie is so involving that you'll forget you're even in the theater. The music, cinematography, and directing all come together to make this movie one of the best of the year.http://thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com",127 Hours
238,andrewkempf,Absolutely beautiful,10,10 June 2019,"This was the best movie I have ever seen, and I'm going to tell you why.
This movie was a work of art. It is a crime that James Franco didn't win a Golden Globe for this. His acting was so spot on that you truly forgot that this was a movie. This is a must see for anyone who loves movies.",127 Hours
239,siobhanmckibbin,94 minutes of impressive film making,7,29 January 2012,"127 Hours is the the true story of an extremist mountain climber Aron Ralston and his remarkable adventure to save himself after a fallen boulder crashes on his arm and traps him in an isolated canyon in Utah.The fact that this movie was based on a true story, makes an audience feel slightly unnerved and uneasy right from the offset, as you already know how the movie ends.James Franco's performance as Aron is nothing less than astounding. He as an actor not only delivers a realistic performance, but as the story continues he delves deep into the character, and brings this fascinating story to life on the big screen. As an audience you feel the pain and frustration Aron does. You sympathise with the character easily, as he struggles to gain control of the situation he has found himself in. James Franco should be highly commended for captivating an audience for an entire film, which can be described as a one man show. It's only at the very beginning and end of the narrative that you see him truly engage with any other characters. I would describe Franco's performance as flawless. Trapped by a boulder, his performance relies in that of his facial expressions. His expressions change so easily, he goes from desperation to comedy to a primitive will to survive in an instant.What also makes this film so successful, is the fact that it is done in the hands of Danny Boyle, a highly commendable director. Boyle's direction is energetic and exciting. Even when the film becomes grounded in the narrow canyon where Aron is trapped, Boyle still manages to keep things interesting. Boyle and his co-writers introduce flashbacks and hallucinations, which bring heart-breaking effects. Included is the premonition that drives Aron into finally amputating his arm.What I was also impressed by in this film was the cinematography which was used. The landscape in itself was breathtaking and the camera angles used show just how vast the canyon is. Then when you get to the confined space when Aron is trapped, they use every camera angle possible, often bringing the audience very close to the action.At the end of the day many people may see this as a film about a mountain climber who gets stuck under a boulder and has to cut his arm off, but it is so much more than that. It personifies a man overcoming physical and emotional strains of an extraordinary situation. Above all it can be seen as a celebration of the human spirit and their will to live. The composition between dark humour, vast and confined spaces, varied editing techniques and Franco's diverse use of facial expressions, make for a well executed piece of filmmaking. Even though as an audience you know how its going to end, it is still very captivating right from the start.",127 Hours
240,jgregg42,It's Not About The Arm,8,24 November 2010,"You have probably heard the story about the man that went canyoneering, alone, in Utah in 2003, not telling anyone where he was going. Five days later he emerged out of the Utah canyons, missing an arm. He had become wedged between a rock and a hard place (literally) and eventually had to cut his own arm off in order to survive. If you were like me you probably thought to yourself, ""Wow, what an awful experience, I bet that sucks. Oh well, back to my life."" The truth is that the self amputation handiwork is not even close to what the man, Aron Ralston, had to go through for the first 124 hours of his ordeal. Having read ""It's Not About the Bike"" by Lance Armstrong, I think it is fair to compare the two stories not only about survivorship but also about the bigger picture in which we call ""life."" You have probably also heard how Armstrong survived testicular cancer to go on to win the Tour De France seven times. Again you might have thought to yourself ""Wow, he had a small bout with cancer and now everything is all right. Oh well, back to my life."" The severe gravity of these situations don't settle in until you hear or see the personal stories of what these individuals endured to earn their lives back. Danny Boyle, is the director who helped bring Ralston's excruciating story to the screen in ""127 Hours."" Boyle, with an eclectic resume including a movie about heroin addiction (""Trainspotting""), a movie about two youngsters finding a bag of money (""Millions""), and a Bollywood movie (""Slumdog Millionaire""), focused on the events that put the viewer in Ralston's position then made that viewer understand that there was only two ways out of the cavern.We start the story with Ralston (played by James Franco) driving out to the Utah canyons while inconveniently forgetting his Swiss Army knife at home (he would need that later). He runs into two young female hikers and introduces them to an underground swimming hole. Not knowing these are the last two people he will have contact with for quite some time.After parting ways with the hikers, Ralston tumbles down a narrow canyon and his right arm becomes wedged between a small boulder and the canyon wall. He has the exact same reaction that I would have, ""AGGHHHH!!!"" I understood his anger because I too would react in the same way. I too would not accept my situation. I too would be cursing at the rock.Before this movie, I did wonder how Boyle was going to keep us engaged for the length of the film. It's a hard task considering Ralston was in one place for five days. Boyle, along with Franco's brilliant acting, was able to keep us flowing from day to day. Sure there are the flash back scenes and a few Scooby-Doo induced hallucinations. But, the one thing that kept my attention was what Ralston actually did while trapped in the crevice. He had a video camera and he videotaped himself giving an ultimate gratitude list to his parents and friends. Even in his dying hours, he wanted his parents to know how he felt about them. He even went as far as producing a humorous morning talk show with himself. It was real, and it worked. That video is now in a safety deposit box where only a few sets of eyes have seen it.Should you see this movie? Yes, but don't see it because a guy cuts off his arm to survive. See it because you want a story about why a guy cuts off his own arm to survive. See it because you need to know the answer to what you would do if you were in Ralston's predicament. See it because you are the type of person (to quote an earlier Boyle movie) to ""choose life"" and you know deep down inside that there is a force driving you.",127 Hours
241,fa-oy,"Interesting, but I didn't feel any emotion.",6,11 January 2011,"I tried this film hoping to be amazed, as I had already read a lot of good critics for this film, and they all pointed it out to be a very breathtaking film. But I found none of this; sure, the film is interesting, it has a damn good photography, but I was expecting to feel that emotion that everybody's been talking about, I was expecting to get in that guy's place, to feel the despair of being in that small place, with your hand stuck in that rock. I expected that because of the hype this film has.As I got none of that, all that is left to say for me is that this film is interesting; many directors wouldn't have probably made a good movie out of this story, but Danny Boyle did a pretty good job.

243,featheredsun,Don't Avoid This Movie!,9,18 March 2011,"I had put off watching this film for a while after getting it, thinking it would be an ordeal and possibly boring - I mean how exciting can watching a guy stuck for almost 5 days be? I was very pleasantly wrong.The movie's pacing is spot on. It pumps you up with a beautiful vitality and exhilaration to where you're having a great time being with actor James Franco and loving his (Aron Ralston's) life as a vigorous adventurer in the wild. And then the accident happens, and you're so right there with him, unbelieving and struck with shock.And it's impossible not to hang in there though all the trial and horror of what follows.Danny Boyle and his team really do well with this movie, artistically, diving into the experience of a man trying to survive, to get free, and into the depths of the soul that stare back when we have no refuge, literally CAUGHT between life and death. Even with the depths of delerium, where reality blurs, this film is never too arty or pretentious.See this movie now, rather than later. It's a hell of a ride.",127 Hours

Where the points of survival are seen and an inspiring story with a young men with an awesome adventure who likes challenges . A great true story and a incredible performance by James Franco which I definitely think was worth it to win an Oscar but only stayed nominated. Through the movie you see everything 1. A very tough man who's trying to get out of there 2. A desperate man who misses his family 3. A sad man who realizes he's been mean to his family and friends and everyone who starts to learn from his mistakes and 4. A man who cuts himself does this and that drinks urine does everything which I would define it a man with a BraveHeart . Don't miss this one it's a great movie :) I give it 9.7 out 10 :) Keep up with the good work JamesFranco . :D,127 Hours
245,Dory_Darko,Kudos to James Franco.,9,18 September 2011,"127 Hours depicts the true story of a guy named Aron Ralston, who went canyoneering in Utah in April 2003. Through a pretty serious event of misfortune, he gets trapped in a canyon by a boulder that pulverises his arm against the canyon wall; literally between a rock and a hard place. And, the desperate measures he resorts to in order to free himself. From a Hollywood perspective, this sounds like it could be turned into a wildly spectacular action film with a bold, heroic protagonist, hysterical relatives and ""Where is my son? PLEASE FIND MY SON!!"" *intense sobbing* - type of dialogue. Yes? No. Boy, am I glad this was directed by Danny Boyle... The man we all know for his raw, authentic film style. Instead of aforementioned blockbuster drama, he opted for an incredibly realistic, documentary-like film. 127 Hours starts off with no form of introduction whatsoever. We do not get to 'meet' Aron or any of his relatives. However, any such introduction quickly proves to be redundant as, over the fast-paced opening credits, we see Aron enthusiastically preparing for and taking off on a hiking trip (ignoring his mother's phone call in the process...), and there you have it: this is a 'too cool for school', overconfident adrenaline junkie, and that's all we need to know. This overconfidence gradually proves to be the source of pretty much all his problems, as it is later on revealed that Aron neglected to tell anyone where he was going... Oops.Like I said, this film looks and feels very much like a documentary, like National Geographic made a big budget reconstruction of the event. The film makers' choice to cast James Franco was a very good one. He is simply amazing. Mind you – he is alone in this film for about 95% of the time. This requires an actor with the guts and skill to carry an entire film, and I must admit, Franco probably wouldn't have been my first choice. But – to my pleasant surprise – he pulls it off, and is actually very worthy indeed of his Oscar nomination. He displays an impressively wide range of emotions, all equally convincing. Panic, disbelief, despair, delusion, hurt and hallucinations. But even confidence, coolness, exhilaration and rationality; it's all there. Aron Ralston, as a character, starts off as a seemingly quite cocky, confident, care-free dude who just wants to enjoy himself and do what he loves most: exploring nature. Without telling his family. But as the film progresses, and Aron realises just what kind of mess he's in, you can slowly see a change occurring in him. And the fact that, after a while you greatly start to sympathize with him and even admire him, despite his obvious stupidity before, is all due to James Franco. He has really proved himself to be a very fine character actor with the capability of moving his audience. There is one scene in particular which I found really captivating. During the 'Tuesday' scene, Aron records himself on his camcorder, acting like he's on a talk show, answering his own questions. This scene is top-notch, acting wise, and this is where you really start to feel for him. Throughout Aron's ordeal, we are shown various flashbacks of his childhood, friends, family and loves. This might seem like a cliché, but honestly, what else are you supposed to think about when you're stuck in a canyon for five days? Some people on the boards and in other reviews have said they think Aron to be a superficial person for not having some kind of spiritual enlightenment while he was trapped, but I just want to voice my own personal opinion on that matter. Honestly, I don't think it's anybody's business to judge what Aron thought and felt throughout his ordeal. We all deal with hardship in our own personal way, and talking to God is not necessarily an option for everyone. Some of us simply draw support from family and love and good memories. I know that's what I'd do. Now, back to technical talk. The sense of realism of 127 Hours comes greatly from the grainy, unsteady camera work and graphic depiction of everything. Which is a note that comes with a warning: this film is not for the faint of heart. What surprised me is that the scene where Aron 'releases' himself is visually very graphic. I won't go into detail, but you really shouldn't watch this if you don't have the stomach.There were only a few minor things which bothered me during this film. It has a few moments which, inevitably are a bit boring. But then again, even that seems to fit into the story, so perhaps it makes sense. And I personally think the music wasn't always very well chosen, some of it didn't really fit somehow. But none of this is really any bother.127 Hours may not be as profound as Into the Wild, but it's certainly a very well-crafted film which deserves respect on its own merits. Also, the photography of the film is really beautiful and some of the scenery of the canyons is truly breathtaking. I would recommend it for the pretty pictures alone. Anyhow, if you're interested in a really good episode of ""I shouldn't be alive"", this is the film for you.",127 Hours
246,SubZeroMK,"127 Hours of excitement, adrenaline, regret, and awesome!",10,9 January 2011,"I LOVE this movie! OK, got that off my chest. Anyways, as I write this review, I'm listening to the song at the start of the movie, called ""Never Hear Surf Music Again"" by the Free Blood. Worth a listen, search it on you-tube. But anyway this was from beside the point of how much I love and recommend this movie to everyone living on planet Earth right now.I saw the movie with high expectations and was disappointed that it wasn't over 2 hours long, but the movie made up for that because the pacing was good and it felt right. The intro to the movie is going to be on my top ten movie intros of all time, reaching in at number 1. For now. The song worked so well and naturally every song and score in this movie worked perfectly, even if it felt out of place at times, which also felt in place! At the same time! Like I said, I am listening to the intro song as I write this. It's so addicting! 127 Hours is the story of Aron Ralston's life-changing experience in 2003 which was news nationwide. He even won person of the year awards. But the story goes that he goes on this canyoning trip somewhere in Utah and while there, he meets two girls that he spends some time showing them around the place because they're lost. After they mingle and leave, he's invited to a party setup by them and he accepts. So he continues to trek for the rest of the day around Utah's beautiful rocky caves.Unfortunately, one open gap leading down into a cave decides his fate for the next few, long, painful days. Aron decides to go on further between the narrow cave gap, and the rock he tested by stomping on it to see if it will fall, falls on him and sends him down the cave, making his arm stuck in the process. After he realizes he's screwed beyond belief he tries to make the best of it, tries to keep himself calm and tries not to think of the worst.Given that he's an engineer, he tries to salvage as much water as possible to survive for the next 127 hours. The only thing he regrets the most? Not leaving a note (which he does now in real life). At the start of the movie, you can hear a phone ringing, and when it goes to voice message, it's his mother saying hi. So, he regrets not picking up the phone because he could have told his mother where he was going, and that would have been his salvation ultimately.After realizing that mistake, the fun begins. He has visions of his past in his youth with his family and events that he thinks lead him to his unfortunate fate. But he tries not to go on the Karma route explanation because he doesn't believe in fate, neither do I. He believes that life is what you make of it, and so do I.So, he does what he can to survive in this entrapment he's in for the next few days. As days pass by, he keeps on hoping and dreaming that he'll free himself, but all his attempts fail. He even has hallucinations of the freedoms he once enjoyed before being in the position he was in. It's like the director actually wants you to believe that there's no hope. But there is. He has a solution which failed before, but not again. He wants to cut off his arm to break free from the trap he's in.Let me tell you, not a pretty scene to watch, but he cuts off his whole arm and breaks free from the grip. He eventually gets an emergency airlift and he is re-united with his family and friends once again. There is a brief cameo from the real Aron Ralston just after the end of the movie. This movie is what happened to the real Aron Ralston back in 2003 and that's why he won so many awards, because of the many obstacles he overcame at impossible odds that not many would sacrifice to get freedom the way he did.And I can't help but think how awesome would it be if Chris Mccandless still lived today; what he would say to Aron Ralston, or better yet, to put them in a room together interviewing each other, becoming great friends and take a canyon trip and record their journey. It would be like two titans coming together, a meeting of the minds. If you don't know who Chris is, then please read the book ""Into the Wild"" or watch the movie, or do both.Anyways, I now depart and hopefully you've enjoyed my thorough review of 127 hours. If you have not watched it, I insist you do watch it. Day 1 blu-ray buy for me, that's for sure!",127 Hours
247,JaysonT,An Intense Experience and Great film!,9,4 February 2011,"Just saw 127 Hours and this was a spectacular experience! James Franco is truly remarkable, and gives a touching and triumphant performance of a man forced to take survival to the next level. While Tom Hanks had a whole island to explore and grow on, Franco has an arm wedged in-between a rock in a canyon. And he makes the most of it, with the infamous ""amputation"" scene being just as graphic and terrifying as its hyped to be.I also want to praise the ending. I have been recently let down by endings from two other Oscar contenders (Black Swan and Blue Valentine). But this one has a satisfying finish, though no movie ending has ended as emotionally as The King's Speech this year. Kudos to Danny Boyle for bringing Franco's situation to other levels by inserting visions and hyper-hallucinations into the movie.The best acting I saw from Franco was actually a smaller moment. When he's bidding farewell to the two pretty ladies who accompany him on a mini-adventure, they tell him about a party they want him to come to. As they're talking to him about it, he intertwines some ""Umm-hmmms"" and ""uh-huhs"" into the mix. The flat and almost automated way he speaks this dialog is extremely convincing. I have met many a guy who is sort of rushed in their way of interaction, and so the words he speaks come across muddled but still friendly. Franco also was a character who was sort of a loner in his own respect, and marched to his own drummer. And that comes across so well in Franco's interpretation.This is one of the best films of 2010, and James Franco deserved his best actor Oscar nod. Also the music is uplifting and pat, and the song ""If I Rise"" is beautiful.",127 Hours

"" we all know what you're gonna do, just hurry up about it."" was all i was thinking throughout the the last half of the movie. as with all Danny Boyle films it is beautifully shot with great music, but there is an absence of story. instead we are supposed to stay with the character through his pains and illusions. this proved to be the worst aspect of the film. the illusions seem to take over and seem to constitute the bulk of focus. that all being said the setting is wonderful and it is a different fare from most films.

Could have been worse as Arron - now married - will find out if that goes wrong; he'll lose a leg as well (sage nod from many out there...).However one-dimensional the premise sounds, what transpires for an hour and a half is as gripping as you could possibly imagine wringing out of it.Tense and unnerving, gruesome, and heartwarming. And that was just my reaction to the reappearance of the Trainspotting couch (looking fitter and stronger; undoubtedly a method-couch).Stunningly shot, a treat for the eye. An absorbing tale of one schmuck's bravery and redemption. Expect to see some alert mobile phone company jump all over it in future. If only he'd remembered...Oh, and kudos to the camcorder company for the longest-life battery ever. If only mine lasted that long on babe-laden vacation beaches...Watch this.

Judging by the plot, the film could've sucked, could've been average, but it was over the top.Danny Boyle showed us many times before that he is a genius, now he has proved it. All the shots are spectacular, the way of storytelling is interesting and the film is amusing, exciting and moving. It shows the suffering of Aron in a very naturalistic way, you feel the same way he does. I don't recommend this film for those, who can't take much, but it is truly a masterpiece.Don't get me wrong, I loved The King's Speech too (it truly deserved to win the Oscar), but this film somehow had a greater impression on me.",127 Hours
255,Left_Hand_of_Dog,One More Take: 127 Hours,7,14 July 2021,"127 Hours chronicles the true story of Aron Ralston, who got his arm crushed by a rock whilst galivanting around in Utah. The title, rather obviously, refers to just how damn long he survived in the situation before, spoilers, cutting off his arm and hobbling to salvation.I like the director, Danny Boyle, quite a bit. Trainspotting is a weird masterpiece of unhinged dark comedy and horrifying humanity, and 28 Days Later is one of the best zombie films ever made, opting for a pure dreadful realism not often inhabited by the genre. This is to name but two in an eclectic career, but shows his capacity for doing vastly different films very well. 127 Hours, unfortunately, doesn't rise to the heights of these, or Slumdog Millionaire. And yet, it feels like it almost could have, given some different stylistic choices.There are two ways, in my mind, to approach a story like this. Let's look at both.1. Keep a tense and narrow focus, both emotionally and visually, on the stark reality of the situation. This would be the more difficult of the two (you'll see why in a moment), mostly due to visual limitations. A filmmaker must be very inventive and creative to have a single-location movie keep up its visual dynamism. A perfect exemplar for this is 12 Angry Men, the masterpiece courtroom drama, wherein Sidney Lumet gradually shifts the framing to make things feel more and more claustrophobic. In a different way, Tarantino's The Hateful Eight similarly functions as almost a stage play, within the confines of a single cabin, but never lacks for dynamic interaction. In terms of spacing, these are relatively tight pieces, but they have the advantage of being about multiple people, and people who can move. When it's just James Franco stuck under a rock for an hour, the task probably seems much more difficult, and likely why Boyle elected the latter:2. Shift your focus. There are a few ways to do this. Thankfully, Boyle didn't go in what would be the obvious direction for a less inventive filmmaker, in cutting away to some parallel story where the protagonist's family, or girlfriend, or (insert character) goes out of their mind with worry. Instead, the film shifts focus by indulging in a form of psychological interiority, where Ralston's life reflections and dehydrated fever dreams come to life in imagination sequences which serve to break up what Boyle probably feared would be the perceived visual monotony of, like we said, James Franco stuck under a rock.Trouble is, these focus shifts had the opposite effect for me, and led what could and should have been an intense claustrophobic scenario into a backslide into indie quirk, which does a tonal disservice to the situation. Yes, it added variety, as Franco dreams of his girlfriend and family and past and so forth, but none of these elements really inform the character in a way that couldn't have been achieved, without losing focus and tone, by him simply speaking these things into his camera, which he does at various other points. This feels strange to say, since ""show over tell"" is generally my soapbox for exposition, but this really isn't exposition. It's not about plot. It's about a man coming to terms with his life and fears and failings, and when you have Franco doing some of the best acting of his life (he's the best part of the movie), keeping the focus right on him would have been, in all ways, better. In addition, we don't really learn anything we don't already infer about the character from these cut-aways. He's a loner, he wishes he wasn't, etc. There's no point in me going too deep into all of that, except to reiterate that starkly focalizing the character and the dire situation would have engendered far more gravity than these quirky imagination scenes. 12 Angry Men works because the camera never leaves that room. 127 Hours should have done the same, and Boyle should have trusted himself, and his audience, enough to persevere in that. The tendency towards quirky interlude may inject visual variety, but it deflates the rawness. We really didn't need the pillow. Let us inhabit the reality of the situation, along with the character, and we'll feel it all the more.FINAL TAKE: Despite this pretty major criticism, 127 Hours is still worth watching. James Franco is much more at home in these small movies than he is in big pictures (one need only look at his flavorless, narcoleptic performances in Oz the Great and Powerful or Rise of the Planet of the Apes for proof), and he is really, really good here, and when the film does keep its focus, it's a winner. The procedural, survival-oriented stuff is great, particularly in the agonizing, pull-no-punches finale. These elements, which comprise the lion's share, earn a recommendation. It's just too bad it didn't stick to its guns. Given the 28 Days Later treatment of brutal, don't-look-away reality, it might have been something really special.",127 Hours
256,CinemaPat,"Making a mountain out of a mole hill, Boyle's masterpiece.",10,2 March 2011,"One fateful day in the canyons of Utah a lone climber fell into the worst predicament he could have imagined. In April of 2003 Aron Ralston found out what he was made of, literally and figuratively. While Aron was trekking the rocky terrain of ""Blue John Canyon"" his luck ran out and fell due to a loose boulder which crushed and trapped his arm against the rock wall. His story is one of hope, triumph, terror and sheer determination. The perfect setting for an intensely satisfying movie experience. Thankfully, director Danny Boyle delivered this in spades.""127 Hours"" is a full feature film about this tragic but conquering incident. Aron Ralston, an avid climber and hiker, played by the talented James Franco, made the near fatal mistake of not telling anyone where he was going. Ralston sets out to his ""home away from home"" and meets a couple of less experienced hikers looking for some adventure. He takes them to a beautiful spot where they enjoy a brief swim, though this section is not factual to the real experience. Afterward, Ralston continues his trek and ends up, as the real Aron Ralston named his book, stuck ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"". What follows is his incredible journey to free himself, rappel a 65 foot rock wall and hike over 8 miles to finally be rescued in one of the most emotional endings in a film to date.There were a lot of challenges in developing a feature length film based on Ralston's amazing story. Many wondered how director Danny Boyle would keep the audience engaged since the setting is a single place with a single character. Not to mention the fact that we all know how the story ends up. Nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Actor and Best Picture it's obvious they overcame these challenges. For one thing, the pacing is perfect as was the accompanying music. Boyle seamlessly transitioned slow dismal scenes with those of courage and optimism. This worked largely due to the variety of music used in the film. From the outstanding original score from A.R. Rahmin to the uplifting ""Lovely Day"" by Bill Withers and the surreal finale from Sigur Rós. To me it seemed like the music was an auditory way of showing his inner thoughts during the whole experience, the soundtrack was a character all it's own.""127 Hours"" is a powerful movie and story. One in which could not have been so successful had it not been for the astounding direction and cinematography. Boyle's team brought the experience of trekking the Utah canyons to life with fluid camera work. A closeup shot of Franco's hand sliding against the rock wall while navigating through the canyon is just one of many examples. Personally, I thought this film should have been not only nominated for Best Cinematography in the Academy Awards but also won. Boyle is a master of his craft and this film further propels him to the top of the list of best directors working today.I won't get into the ""meat"" of the amputation scene, but I will say that it was one of the most intense things I've witnessed in film. That is saying a lot considering the types of movies I watch and review here. Disturbingly accurate this scene was filmed in one take using multiple camera's and only one prosthetic arm. Yet another testimony to Franco's superb acting. Following the amputation scene we see more outstanding direction and cinematography as Ralston makes the final journey to his rescue. The best part about this final sequence is that we know what happens but while watching we are at the edge of our seat. We put aside what we already know and just go along for the ride. The direction causes us to be unsure if he will make it or not. That is the brilliance of ""127 Hours"" and Boyle's production team.I highly recommend this film as it is one of the best stories and film of at least the last few years. Boyle said it best and I'll end this review with his quote: ""This is a film about how precious life is. And it's only precious because of other people. It's not precious in itself, which is what we sometimes think - we think the will to survive is an individualistic thing. ... But it's actually connected to other people. And that's what the life essence is really about - it's always about other people, even in the loneliest places."" - Danny Boylehttp://cinemapat.blogspot.com/2011/03/127-hours-danny-boyle-2010.html",127 Hours
257,saareman,A completely cathartic life-or-death experience,10,13 September 2010,"I started loving this film within the first few seconds. 127 Hours begins immediately with the sound of Fresh Blood's ""Never Hear Surf Music Again"" (""There must be some f*%#ing chemical, chemical in your brain, that makes us different from animals, makes us all the same."" etc...) just as featured in the 1st trailer. That not-ripped-off euphoric feeling (how many times have you seen a trailer with a perfect song/music and then felt betrayed that it wasn't in the film later... yeah, me too) carried on all the way through the rest of the film.The film has an energetic start with a split screen showing office-bound commuters/workers going along their daily drudge while our lead, x-treme biker/hiker/climber Aron Ralston (played to perfection by actor James Franco) packs his gear (unfortunately not finding his Swiss Army knife which might have made a lot of difference to him later on) for a trek into Blue John Canyon country in Utah. While on his way he has a brief fun climbing/diving/swimming interlude with two female hikers (played by Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn). He then heads off on his own and at about 20 minutes into the movie takes a tumble with a small boulder that ends up pinning his right arm against the side wall of the thin crevice of a canyon. And that is where we are with him for the next ""127 hours"" (but only 1 hour of screen time) that it takes him to get loose.I'm not going to spoil that resolution here, although most will likely hear about it anyway before seeing the movie. An obvious clue that he survives is given by the screen credit early in the film that says it is ""based on the book Between A Rock And A Hard Place by Aron Ralston"". The guy must of survived if he wrote a book about it right? Well, you can survive in many ways and not all of them leave you whole (both mentally and physically).Director Danny Boyle brings a lot of the key Oscar-winning players of the Slumdog team back for this new film. Screenwriter Simon Beaufoy, soundtrack composer A.R.Rahman and cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle (this time paired with Enrique Chediak) are chief among those. As an added bonus, from the director of the toilet-diving cam in Trainspotting, we now have the ""desperately thirsty character saves his own urine so it can be filmed while drunk through a tube""-cam in this movie.At the Toronto Film Festival's 2nd screening of the film, Boyle was there to take questions from the audience and his enthusiasm and excitement about the film were infectious. Tidbits included his talking about their 6 days of location shooting followed by a sound-stage recreation of the canyon based on 3D scanning imagery. Boyle also praised actor James Franco and emphasized how every time we see him in a new film he is stretching his talents and abilities, unlike many lead actors who are just basically playing themselves in various different situations.Boyle said that for an audience to watch what would otherwise be deemed ""unwatchable"" you either had to be making a schlocky/not-to-be-taken-seriously horror movie OR you had to make the audience completely identify with the character to the extent that they would believe that they themselves would have done the exact same thing to save themselves if they had to. Well, Boyle succeeds in making you believe it.Seen at the Ryerson Theatre, Toronto Sept. 13, 2010. 2nd screening of 3 at TIFF 2010.",127 Hours

259,SteveJ_888,A Missed Opportunity,4,28 June 2011,"Part of the problem is that the subject matter raises the standard for a film such as this. The story would seem to require a tone and a style that's driven by some essential truth – not necessarily a literal dramatization, but something fundamental and permanent for the viewer to discover or reflect upon. If that's not in Danny Boyle's bag of tricks – fine. I just wish he had left the story for someone else.The film is noisy and cluttered. It's like a person with little to say that never stops talking for fear of a lull in the conversation. The music is abrasive and usually feels like an intrusion. There seems to be little effort by the filmmakers to create a mood that conveys what the experience must have been like. There is no passage of time – only images of a watch. Whenever something genuine seems ready to emerge it's preempted by some montage of remote events, as if the viewer constantly needs to be reminded that life goes on somewhere else.Visually, you would think that it would be hard for a film like this to miss. There are some great shots, but the effect is never sustained. It's always undermined by some subsequent material, as if the filmmakers have an unconscious need to negate anything beautiful in their own work.John Franco gives a decent performance, but many of the character's actions don't seem plausible in the given situations, due to the writing. The film's biggest flaw is that it's simply not believable.If you haven't already read the book, you'll want to after seeing 127 Hours. The film simply doesn't ring true. Hopefully other filmmakers who have a greater affinity for the subject will take it on at some point in the future – either as a documentary or a dramatization.

From start to finish, Franco draws you in by combining all the right amounts of humor, emotion and tension that the audience is immediately captivated and convinced by the way he emerges into Aaron. He also gets you physically immersed and emotionally attached to his character that you just can't help but root and cheer for him. This isn't Boyle's best work, but by providing beautiful cinematography and using bold and elegant camera-work to bring this remarkable true story to the screen, he's able to take you along for another unforgettable journey.

The movie portrays the character in a very bad light, from being stupid to arrogant to crazy. 1) He is never in pain. From the fall to the rescue, there's no display of pain at all, just self loathing. 2) The character is extremely arrogant. Humoring his situation and not once feeling the need to cry out to a higher power which in most cases I'm sure most people would do. Maybe he wanted to be politically correct. 3) He has episodes of sexual arousal, I kid you not. He even plays a video and tries to masturbate. 4) Very poor stoy telling. In fact there is no story. Everything tries to stand on the one fact that he is stuck at the canyon. So the reason for all the high points ?

268,neji107,It makes a better story than it does a movie,6,18 November 2010,"127 Hours, as its title suggests, recounts the 127 hours that hiker and rock climber Aron Ralston spends stranded in a slot canyon, based on recounts of the true story in Ralston's best-selling memoir ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"". After an accident with a loose rock, Ralston stumbles into a crevice and ultimately lands with his right arm wedged tightly between the rock and the canyon wall. As the days pass by, Ralston runs low on water, uses up his food, and his efforts at chipping away at the rock with a dull knife seem to be in vain. The only thing that keeps him going are promises he made to his family and the hope that he would one day see his loved ones again.As you can imagine, this movie is as much director Danny Boyle's as it is James Franco's. When nearly all of the film's 94 minutes consist of Franco's psychological turmoil, his acting has to carry the movie, and as expected, Franco pulls it off very nicely. Expect some terrific and believable acting as Ralston struggles not only to free himself from the rocky prison, but also to come to terms with personal mistakes he made earlier in his life. However, 127 Hours may unwittingly fall into the category of 'psychological thriller', and with such a genre comes some strong expectations: intense scriptwriting and extraordinary acting. While the film may not necessarily be a ""thriller"" because it purposely recounts the real-life story of Aron Ralston, it still falls victim to its requirements; and this is where we see a disappointment in the movie. Nothing is missing from the acting side, but the script is regular, rather boring, and predictable. We know Ralston is still alive, we know he suffered, we know some parts were gritty- but no flourish is added to the original story to make it interesting. Everything is straightforward- no twists. 127 Hours wishes itself to be more engaging than it actually is. Still, it stays close to the facts of the book, which leads me to the conclusion that Ralston's tale makes a better story than it does a movie (and that psychological thrillers may not be Boyle's strong suit).James Franco puts out a terrific role in this movie, but aside from his performance you can't expect anything too out-of-the-ordinary or impressive. 6/10",127 Hours
269,dominicpearson,Doesn't quite hit the heights expected,7,6 August 2011,"It is no easy task reviewing a film of this nature. For one, the story is already known and is a very, very real one. This gives those intending to watch it the knowledge that for the best part of an hour and a half it is going to be a bloke stuck with a big rock on his arm. For another it is a single set, single actor set up for the vast majority and in the wrong hands could be a total nightmare. These are inhibitions that the film is going to have to overcome even before it has been viewed.It was with this in mind that I made the decision to watch 127 Hours after having it for a good couple of months. Upon initial viewing I found little of interest in the film and my fears seemed to have been well placed. It was as I have said above - bloke stuck with a big rock on his arm. But I have found that it is one of those rare breed of films that plays on your mind and grows in your affections over time.So what is good about it. The performance that Boyle has managed to get from James Franco is testament to his skill as a director and Franco's as an actor.Franco has impressed me with his performances of late. Milk, Howl (dreadful film, great performance) and Pineapple Express are all splendid and he was very much the right person for the job here. The character he plays is, to me at least, pretty unlikeable. He was selfish, arrogant and careless. Yet through sharing in his unthinkable experience a sense of empathy is developed; the regrets of his life are played out leading to a degree of realisation and repentance. Whether this will change his attitude in the future is another matter entirely but there is hope for him that he will learn from his mistakes and become a better person. At its heart, therefore, its a tale of redemption and are we not all seeking this?! The nuances of the personality are all conveyed by an actor in his prime tasked with an extremely difficult proposition - one set, limited mobility, no other actors around. Franco deserves plaudits for this performance and this aspect alone is worth the majority of my grading.As always, Danny Boyle's direction was spot on. The difficulties of such a film were met head on and the story develops at a solid pace. The photography is impressive, the locations kind of do the hard work but it looks lovely on film. The soon to be famous last scene in the crevice is very realistic and not something for the weak stomached! It is an impressive translation of the story.So why only 7 out of 10? Well to be honest Id probably give it 7.5 but IMDb is a silly so I cant. It wasn't quite perfect. As I said, it was only after viewing that the story really started to hit me. I may watch it again to see if this delayed development translates into increased enjoyment but this is unlikely. It is not the type of film that has repeated viewing qualities. It will never be considered a classic but what it is is a solid film, impressively acted and skillfully directed. When history looks back on Boyle's portfolio of work I would say this would rank well behind Trainspotting, Shallow Grave, 28 Days Later and Slumdog all of which are 8-10 star films. For this reason I have judged it as I have!",127 Hours
270,IloveHanks,Every Second Counts Of this Classic Movie.,10,4 March 2011,"127 Hours is a brilliant movie from the brilliant Danny Boyle. Arguably the best movie of the year,only Boyle could have made a movie about a guy trapped in a boulder with such ingenuity and craftiness.I can never imagine the state of mind that Aron Ralston was in, probably don't want to.Danny Boyle has unarguably added one more feather in his already illustrious cinematic cap by making 127 hours. The movie ironically about being a man who is static moves us a lot. It just shows that when man is really facing adverse circumstances he realizes the most important things in his life which he never would have thought in the first place.Boyle never hesitates and hence doesn't compromise in showing the explicitly graphic scenes involving blood. This makes the movie watching experience more vicarious , something that only Boyle can do with such conviction.AR Rehman's Sound track is easily tied at best for the year with social network. Rehman's work here is better compared to his previous work with Boyle, Slumdog Millionaire seeing that Rehman had a tougher job at hand while creating score for a movie that apparently never moves.James Franco has confirmed his potential as a star in the making by delivering a splendid performance. Only a stuttering King would have been able to stop him from getting all the major accolades.Overall 127 Hours is yet another must watch movie from the genius Danny Boyle, for whom my respect has grown increased by leaps and bounds. It is really sad to see that it went empty handed at most of the award ceremonies this year.Do not miss even a second as Every Second Counts .",127 Hours
271,movieevangelist,Review: 127 Hours,8,26 January 2011,"The Pitch: Mostly Armless.The Review: It's a fair question to anyone who's ever won a major award, especially something as high profile as the Best Director Oscar – what next? Looking back over the last decade of winners, it would be safe to say that, with the possible exception of the Coen brothers, every winner has either peaked when they won the award or sometime before it. Slumdog Millionaire might have been his Oscar winner, but Trainspotting had been his calling card for a decade before that, and try as he might, until the his trip to the slums he'd struggled to repeat the composed brilliance of that and his first feature, Shallow Grave. However, another common theme of those award winning directors is their desire and ability to swap between genres and styles as if it was almost compulsory, and in that respect Boyle is no different.So after a sweeping epic with a touchstone of popular culture at its core, Boyle has decided to make a high concept true story. If you don't know by now, Aron Ralston was an experienced and cocky young canyoneer who ventured into the rocky wilderness of Utah in 2003, and didn't feel the need to tell anyone his whereabouts. Several hours later, Ralston came to be stuck at the bottom of a tiny crack in the rocks, miles from civilisation, his right arm pinned by an immovable boulder. Having explored his options, he eventually concludes that the only realistic option for his survival is to cut it off If you were unaware of that particular development and are now about to complain strenuously about spoilers, then don't. Rather than the structure of a thriller, the hours counting down like a reverse Jack Bauer marathon, Boyle has fashioned a character piece, albeit one with hallucinations of a giant inflatable Scooby Doo and old girlfriends thrown in. The intention is to put you resolutely in Ralston's shoes, to feel what he feels, and to understand what you'd do in that hopeless position. In much the same way as Ryan Reynolds did in that coffin last year, James Franco gets to prove his acting chops with some varied challenges and acquits himself remarkably well. Which is a relief, for despite odd appearances from Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn as the girls he meets on his way to the cavern, and Clémency Poésy as the apparitional ex, Franco is the only person on screen for the majority of the run time.Boyle has a kinetic and restless visual style, so doesn't remain pinned down for a second; his visual shorthand seems odd at first, such as shots from the inside of a water bottle, but allows for reams of exposition without requiring a man to spend the best part of ninety minutes talking to himself (water refreshing, water lower, water running out, water oh wait, that's not water); Ralston had a video camera and so we do get a little inner monologuing. But what we are doing to a certain extent is killing time until the third act, and it's the structure that is the only real drawback here, our hero (who is not seen as a totally reformed character by his experience, more fortunate to possess the necessary skills to execute the deed) stuck early on and the mere title causing us to keep checking our watches until the clock runs out and Right, those of a nervous disposition needn't bother, for at this point Boyle cranks it up to the max, and you will feel every action to your very core. Boyle uses every trick in the book to help you truly understand what a man goes through when he has to remove a decent sized chunk of himself . But for the lopsided structure, this could have been another classic; instead, it's a worth watch and a wonderful tribute to man's endurance, but it just may test your endurance a little before it's all over.Why see it at the cinema: If you want to test your mettle and don't feel up to torture porn, then 127 Hours has all of the gore and the anguish but comes with more character work and added street cred.

274,alerter,everything I've done and every choice I made brought me to this place and moment in time,10,13 November 2010,"It took four years for Danny Boyle to be able to make a non-documentary film based on the real life ordeal of American mountaineer and adventurer Aron Ralston.The early obstacle was Ralston, who originally insisted that his memoir, Between_a_Rock_and_a_Hard_Place, had to be filmed as a straight documentary. What eventually changed Ralston's mind was Boyle's phenomenal Slumdog Millionaire. Boyle also had to call in every industry marker owed to him, over the financial success of Slumdog, in order to finally get 127 Hours made. The end result is another work of genius from Boyle and co-writer Simon Beaufoy and a tour de force performance by James Franco portraying Ralston.127 Hours winds up being truer to the momentous essence of Ralston's story than straight documentary could have managed.We get to see and enjoy some of the upsides of Ralston's pre-ordeal ""hard hero"" lifestyle. It's fun and exhilarating for also being reckless and extremely fortunate, right up to the point when the luck runs out.A failure to prepare (beyond sheer physical ability) compounds the direness of a seemingly single misstep that turns out to be one in a long line of lucky mistakes. When every ounce matters, better gear was packed for entertainment (CD player, camera, video recorder, spare AA batteries) than for survival (dynamic rope, harness webbing, 'biners, headlamp, belay device and a poorly maintained, no-name multi-tool with blades as dull as a butter knife). Not a single rock tool among them. (What blade sharpens itself, except in TV commercials?) None of that's about hindsight being 20-20; it's about training and preparedness. Ralston full well knew better.As sensational as Ralston's true story is, Boyle makes a shrewd choice to underplay the pivotal act that Ralston is forced to commit, in order to save his own life, so that viewers never lose sight of the larger context of the story (insouciant selfishness) and are permitted to get inside of Ralston's expanding frame of mind. We see what we have to see and nothing more. (Some of what Ralston really did to his necrotic right hand is never depicted in the film, because it would have thrown the film far off into Saw territory.) This is very important, because frank self-criticism is an essential and transformative element of Ralston's experience. This is more profound than regret or even the will to live. This allows the many messages embedded within the story to have an impact on us, without over doing it.Life threatening shock, elemental exposure, exhaustion, dehydration, electrolyte imbalance and likely early onset blood poisoning can individually, let alone in combination, produce moments of vivid hallucination and even supposed lucid premonition, in real life -- and to the film's story telling advantage. Some license is taken with these episodes, but mostly on the margins, with dazzling camera work. Much of what we see is what Ralston says he experienced and I have no doubts about the latter. What's even more amazing is how fully Franco immerses himself in episodes of grim determination and then delirium.I was an avid non-professional climber back in the 1970s-80s, but not one of the gonzo-types with something to prove. I always knew that no matter what any human being brings to bear out in the elements, Mother Nature's got plenty of surprises that can overwhelm anyone and everyone. I climbed with a self-selected group who trained together and shared a life-and-death view that each of us goes in, and comes back, with ten fingers and ten toes. Every time. We began and ended with dotted I-s and crossed T-s of outdoorsmanship. We maintained our equipment because safety depended on it. We studied mountaineering medicine and wilderness survival, because we knew we'd have to rely on ourselves, not on radios or cel phones, in a jam. We practiced tying proper knots with one hand, because you can never know when you might have to. Every climb was technical, yet even with proper equipment in correct use, when things went wrong, it could happen faster than you could snap your fingers. Randomness (luck) always remains a factor; but luck tends to punish the prepared less.I've fallen on belay, with the sickening experience of carabiners popping out, one after another. Ideally, they're not supposed to do that, but, at the same time, they're still helping to slow my fall, while I hope that one will finally hold, before I crash to a dead stop on top of some hard, unyielding thing. It's an icy feeling. It happens fast. You, and your fast belayer, think those thoughts.Franco's sudden fall from the chockstone struck me as being very realistic, but that didn't hit me viscerally. The moment when Franco *chose* to break his radius and then his ulna, that's when I felt my blood leaving my hands and feet, in involuntary sympathetic shock, resurrecting a body memory of my own mishaps on climbs.While self-rescue was a huge part of this story, Ralston would still have perished if he had not come upon the three vacationing hikers from the Netherlands, who provided him with water and food and then summoned a rescue helicopter.Ralston extricated himself, but he likely still would not have survived all by himself.While I'm not sure if Ralston has ever said it in exactly the words used in my title, the profoundly correct grasp of karma, as spoken by Franco at one point in the film, must be at the heart of why Ralston has said that he did not lose his hand, rather, he gained back his life, in the sense of his conscious connectedness to all of the people who are in it.127 Hours has a grippingly authentic general feel that perfectly compliments the specific drama. It's artistry is everywhere, in the script, the cinematography, the score, set design, editing, direction and acting.Absolutely Oscar worthy, on multiple counts.",127 Hours

276,talasam12345,Great tale of how amazingly strong the human spirit is,8,18 September 2020,"127 hours is a movie about the human spirit. This is not a dynamic, action-filled movie with a lot of cgi. This movie is tame, it settles in your brain slowly and is damn good at this.The film is shot in almost only one location and with almost only one actor - the incredible James Franco in his maybe best performance in his career. The editing and Danny Boyle's directing is very smart, different from the majority of the movies. The cinematography for me is the biggest weapon 127 hours has. The cinematography is terrific with shot of the Utah canyons like i have never seen before, shots from the bottom of Aaron's bottle, the absolutely disgusting (but great) shot of him slowly drinking his urine from the bag. This is the films strongest part. And also James Franco - his acting was great, given that he didn't have anyone to work with, acting alone and with almost no lines. What that guy did was awesome. I like him since Pineapple Express but I think this is his top.There are however some thing that were not as good. The music was kinda like I was watching some kind of a comedy movie, especially at the end, it really took the emotional impact it must had on the viewer. The scene with the arm was extremely overhyped too. I saw comments that it was one of the most brutal and realistic things ever on film, but it was just some average gore and not that impactful and brutal at all. The hype was just TOO MUCH. The flashback scenes although good were not important enough, they didn't shape the character of Franco, which at the end was almost the same guy we came to know from the beginning.Apart from these not so serious flaws 127 hours was a very good movie, with amazing story about human survival and will, played perfectly by James Franco and a movie I will watch again sometime.",127 Hours

There he gets into an accident that leaves his arm stuck by a rock. With little water and food Aron is trapped for five days, time while he reflects back to his life, friends, family and battles brutal inhumane will, courage and strength to free himself and be saved. As the trailer says--- ""There is no force on Earth more powerful than the will to live"".James Franco portrays Aron Ralston, and lets be honest, he does that remarkably well. It is just such a powerful performance helped by superb camera-work and visuals. I haven't been this impressed for a long long time. The cinematography is really strong and the film itself is brilliantly edited. 127 Hours has just such a fantastic style. Weather its Aron cycling in the desert, stunning long shots of the nature or simple highway lights at nights town, Boyle captures it all splendidly. I especially liked the one-on-ones Aron has with his camera. ""Good morning everyone, it is 7 o'clock here in Canyonland, U-S-A. And this morning on the boulder... We have a very special guest, Aron Ralston!"" If Franco doesn't get the Academy Award here, it must be something really wrong with the system.The experience you get absorbs you.

279,BeautifulDisaster5287,A Beautiful and Horrifying Journey,9,17 January 2011,"Hold On To Your Seat: I just finished this wonderful vision of film making tonight at approximately 3:01 a.m. and I am still feeling the chills from the ending. Basically the entire movie is James Franco (hardly moving) alone, with a rock smashed on his right arm. He has hallucinations, and a (fake) little radio show moment (shot through his digital camera) and a small amount of tools to figure out a way to survive. Watching him look into the camera and talk about how sorry he is for not calling his mom back, and how he won't make it to his sister's wedding is heart wrenching. Annnnd this is a true story. Having said that, it is also one of the most well-acted one man movies I've seen since Castaway. No wonder the academy loves Mr. Franco.Best Scenes: 1. The beginning when he meets two girls hiking the trail he's hiking. 2. All the digital camera scenes. 3. The ending (If your queasy you might want to look away)It's Not An Action Movie: So if you came to see one...go see Tron instead. This is a suspenseful character study and a journey into the life (and mind) of someone who went through a horrific experience. Believe me when I say it's pretty much a one-man movie. Also believe me when I say you shouldn't pass it up.Best Line: Aron: ""You know, I've been thinking. Everything is... just comes together. It's me. I chose this. I chose all this. This rock... this rock has been waiting for me my entire life. It's entire life, ever since it was a bit of meteorite a million, billion years ago. In space. It's been waiting, to come here. Right, right here. I've been moving towards it my entire life. The minute I was born, every breath that I've taken, every action has been leading me to this crack on the out surface.""Hello Danny Boyle: If you're a fan of his work, you will surely not be disappointed with this movie. He directed and co-wrote the screenplay for this movie and it is gooooooooood. Also if you are a nerd like me, you'll know who A.R. Rahman is (the guy behind Slumdog Millionaire's music) and you'll know he did the music for this movie as well. It's very good and....oh hey wait....oh hayyyy Dido! She's here too and her song is kinda the theme song for the movie.Overall: Go see it. It's worth a watch but be warned...it's claustrophobic and you watch a guy cut something off at the end so yea.

280,patrickmbrame,"Beyond Inspirational, Superbly Directed and Brilliantly Acted",10,16 January 2011,"Just finished watching 127 Hours, I still have the credits and song playing in the background. Kind of speechless right now with what I just watched. I feel like I was trapped in a canyon with my arm stuck. Where to start.Boyle is on top of his game with this one and right away you can tell its a Danny Boyle movie. It has fast cuts, hand held camera work and a beautifully appropriate constructed soundtrack. Using all these tools he places you right in Aaron Ralston shoes, and they are not the shoes you want to be in. We are introduced to Aaron, played by Franco, getting ready for a hiking expedition and his journey as he gets there. He rides his bike 17 miles, locks it up and then hikes running into two girl hikers. He helps them on their way and shows them a ton of fun. Through the prelude here, we see that Aaron is a fun loving guy, living for the thrill of living, the rush, he just wants to be outdoors, which will ultimately put him through hell. I thought this had one of the better preludes of a film in a while, with upbeat music, beautifully shot scenery, your ready to join him yourself. It's not until a rock falls and is lodged between the canyon wall and his arm are we shown the title 127 Hours, and with Franco's terrified face. Just an awesome shot, and really all we need to see to understand what is to come.For the next Hour and fifteen minutes we are with Aaron, stuck. We are dealing with Aaron's mortality, and thus thinking of our own. From here Boyle direction and Franco's acting places you in the canyon. He uses extreme close ups on Franco's face repeatedly to instill a sense of claustrophobia and fear (this more so due to Franco's acting). There are even shots from the inside of his thermos and camel back, placing you in Aaron's mind. Imagining the water flowing to you and becoming less and less. There are few times he will use a shot that pans back from the canyon and displays the empty desert creating for the audience Aaron's loneliness and crushing reality of his surroundings. The sound was an especially well done aspect, specifically with the water. Boyle cranks up the sound of the water sloshing around in the thermos, or going through the hose in the camel back, you'll actually get thirsty while watching. While Boyle places the audience in the canyon with his direction the writing and Franco make us start to deal with our own mortality.Throughout the time in the canyon, you are constantly shown flashbacks and memories of Aaron's leading up to the event. He starts out with what we all would start with, regret about not telling anyone where he was going, what he should have brought with him, etc. As time goes on he starts to think about life, how he treated people that he loved, and what he's leaving behind. Up until the climatic vision that gives him the strength to survive. And really who wouldn't be doing this. He constantly is keeping record on his video camera, keeping his own sanity as well as the audience's. Really the whole time you are thinking that that's probably what you yourself would be doing and thinking thus really making you think about your own life.Its an extremely powerful film. Inspirational, depressing, scary, and the climax of the film is grotesquely real. Its such an unbelievable amazing true story of survival and what the human body and mind are capable of. I'd say go out and enjoy it, but I don't know if enjoy is the right word. I can guarantee that you will be moved and inspired by this film due to Boyles direction, Franco's acting, and of course the real Aaron Ralston.",127 Hours
281,ymsyctai,Outstanding.,9,7 January 2012,Here we have a hip little movie about a rock climber and the power of will power. Chances are James Franco is a total stone head but the dude is an amazing actor. This movie only goes on to prove that however this film's true hero is the director. He tells a story of survival and uses almost every trick in the book to keep you on the edge of your seat because let's face it... this movie is about a guy with his hand stuck in a rock. More or less the director needs mad credits for this one. Amazing how this is based on a true story.

285,aschein81,"""127 Hours"" is a subtle analogy to America's current economic issues....should we decide to cut off ""the invisible hand"" and prevent reckless risk-taking?",9,12 December 2010,"""127 Hours"" is the true story of avid mountain climber Aron Ralston (James Franco - in the performance of a lifetime here), who decided to take a spontaneous hiking trip to Canyonlands National Park in Utah one Spring day in 2003 without taking a cell phone with him and without telling anyone where he was going. Unfortunately, while hiking through a canyon well below the ground surface a boulder fell down on Ralston's right forearm, therefore trapping himself in that location. Ralston was forced to survive on one full water bottle and one day's supply of food for 5 days - before he took the drastic and incredible measure of cutting off his own forearm to set himself free. This movie is all about the art of immersing the audience with Ralston and letting us experience his psyche during the slow-paced 5 days of hell he experienced, with little to no dialogue for most of the film. Franco's performance overall is simply spectacular, and deserving of the Oscar for Best Actor (even though he probably won't get it because of his young age). The numerous close-ups of his face with his bloodshot, droopy eyes, clenched teeth, and veins popped out of his neck and forehead can only make me imagine the hell director Danny Boyle put him through while filming this movie. Boyle and Franco never wuss out when it comes to showing us the dark sides of life in the hole, as they aren't afraid to let us see large ants (real) crawling on Franco's face or him almost drowning to death during a terrential downpour that almost fills up the entire canyon one night.As Ralston, Franco shows us a character that always lived life to the extreme and could easily be described as cocky and arrogant. In the first 15 minutes of the film when he is beginning to explore the canyons, we see him arrogantly flirt with a couple of young female hikers, and later in the film during some flashbacks we see his partying lifestyle where he believed that he was basically immortal. Yet while this overconfidence and arrogance is likely the reason why he got himself trapped in his dilemma in the first place, ironically it could also be said that both of those traits gave him the emotional strength to keep fighting as the days passed by.One would think that a film like this would be either extremely depressing to watch or extremely inspirational to watch, but I personally found it to be neither. I was simply so immersed in the canyon with Franco that I felt as though I was just focused on doing whatever it took to get through the days and nights, just as he was, and that I didn't have time to feel a lot of different emotions. He's neither someone you truly root for, nor someone you root against, mostly because you don't really know much about him - it's just all about the business and strategy of trying to figure out what to do in the moment to survive. Also, I was pleased that Danny Boyle basically focused the entire movie on Ralston's dilemma in the hole with some sporadic flashbacks of memories with his families and friends, rather than adding on some kind of extra subplot with a rescue recovery team trying to find him or his girlfriend consistently waiting on the couch to hear from him back home. We see a few short clips of Ralston imagining his girlfriend talking to him, but it's all seen from the perspective of his own psyche and mental state in the hole - rather than creating scenes from a typical search and rescue plot.The film is also a very subtle analogy to America's economic meltdown in 2008, and Ralston serves as symbolism for that. Danny Boyle clearly means for people to think about this in the film, as he shows a guy in a store in the beginning for 10 seconds with a t-shirt that reads ""You can't lay me off today."" Ralston is of course an avid risk-taker who does everything he wants individually, regardless of thinking of any possibly dangerous consequences. He just takes any risk he wants in the outdoors, and never plans for anything to go wrong. It's pure individualism and risk-taking taken to the extreme. It's a very fitting comparison to our economic structure of unregulated capitalism and gambling in recent years, and how we allow individualism on Wall Street to take risks with our money on a daily basis, without any kind of ""back up plan"" in case of unintended consequences. We now see ourselves (not just the United States, but also much of the world) still struggling with the effects of our economic collapse. Perhaps we can learn from Ralston by making some changes so we have our own preventive back up plan and focus less on ""all or nothing risk-taking"" individualism so we don't have our own tragic accident like this again. Ralston clearly decides that he has had enough of it, as he makes the choice of cutting off ""Adam Smith's invisible hand"" (his hand was under the rock, so it was invisible to him), to set himself free. No more unregulated capitalism and reckless risk-taking and greed for Mr. Ralston - he has learned from his mistake.It's a shame that a movie with great acting and directing like this has only made a mere 7 million dollars after already being in release for a month now, and that it has only been released in a select number of theaters nationwide. This is terrific art to watch being created on the screen and I sure hope it ends up making a solid profit on its 17 million dollar production budget. Hopefully the fact that Franco is now co-hosting The Oscars this year will call more attention to it and get it some name recognition.",127 Hours
286,movieswithmitch,Inspiration on screen,9,12 November 2010,"By the end of ""127 Hours"" when Aron Ralston (James Franco) gruesomely removes himself from the 800-pound boulder his arm is pinned to, we, the audience, are left in a euphoric state. It is a celebration of the great victory of a man overcoming death and finding the will to survive. This film is such an intense experience. Director Danny Boyle and James Franco take us on an exhilarating journey of the shock, acceptance, regret, anger, and hope that resulted in this reviewer squirting a few tears of joy. ""127 Hours"" is the story of a life inspired put on screen and easily one of the better films of the year.Based on best selling memoir, ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"", Ralston recounts the events that took place in Utah's Blue John Canyon in April of 2003. Boyle introduces us to the film and to Ralston with an energetic opening split screen of dutch shots (static shot from a slanted angle) of busy crowds alongside Ralston hurriedly grabbing his gear in his apartment for his weekend trip. Boyle doesn't drop the hammer right away, instead showing the exuberance of Ralston playing in his nirvana. When Aron comes upon two pretty girls lost in Blue John he plays guide and shows the ladies the best way to reach the deep bright blue lake. Ralston parts with the girls, skipping off to his next destination.Shortly thereafter, the solitary Ralston slips resulting in his arm being stuck. This is where the film would have been lost with a lesser actor. But Franco seizes every scene as he and Boyle begin to put us through the emotional ringer. Franco impressively relays those first few moments of paralyzed shock, to angrily realizing his will and determination alone aren't enough to save him, to beginning to assess the situation and think his way out. The only things he has with him are his camcorder, watch, climbing gear, a cheap dull knife and most importantly, very little food and even less water. Ralston's greatest asset is that, for the most part, he is not one who panics, which Franco maneuvers by using his goofy nature to keep his wits about him.Since Ralston is the sole character on screen for the majority of the movie, Danny Boyle uses music as another character. Opening with the kinetic ""Never Hear Surf Music Again"" from Free Blood, to pulling an exhausted Ralston and audience back up with Bill Withers ""Lovely Day"", Boyle never lets the film get stagnant from the restraints of his location. This is due in great part of his successful decision to use two cinematographers in Anthony Dod Mantle and Enrique Chediak. The two different visions play off each other as Aron Ralston struggles with the physical and psychological effects of being trapped. Extreme close-ups of Franco and nifty camera shots through the water bottle keep the viewer tightly encased with Aron.What Boyle really gets right is putting us in Aron's head. The longer Aron is forced to look death in the eye, the more his memories, nightmares, and delusions pop up. When Aron's mind races all the way back to his vehicle for the Gatorade he left on the seat, as commercial visions of beverage refreshment take over, I've never been so thirsty. Regrets and an inner look at his life's decisions become more agonizing than the physical aspect. Realizing his selfishness of not picking up his mother's phone calls or letting the girl get away, torment Aron but it's the vision of what life has in store for him that ultimately leads him out of peril. When the self-amputation scene arrives it may be too strong for some but it is necessary. The intensity it takes to do such a thing creates a powerful moment that won't quickly leave your memory. Inspired is the best word for what remains because you're left there finding what you want to live for and how you'd lose an arm to do it. When Ralston miraculously sees people, he screams, ""I need help"", for the first time in his life allowing himself not to be a superhero.""127 Hours"" is definitely up there with ""Trainspotting"" as one of Danny Boyle's best films and I don't need to say it but I will anyway; it's a foregone conclusion that James Franco will be nominated for Best Actor and at this point I've seen no other performance that would beat it.I've seen no other performance that would beat ""this"" Matthew 24:13﻿",127 Hours
287,PopcornJury,127 Hours is one of the most exhausting and exhilarating movies of the year. A must-see for those who can handle it.,8,29 November 2010,"Rarely am I compelled to review a movie immediately after seeing it on film. More often than not, it leads to me drawling a far too subjective conclusion on something too fresh to have fully settled in. With 127 Hours, I have decided to make an exception because I think the way I feel about the film immediately after viewing it adds an element to the review that can't be conveyed in words. What's the element- complete and utter exhilaration and total mental exhaustion.I've been involved in two big accidents since the day I started driving. Both resulted in two totaled cars (mine and the others), a serious hike in insurance, and a healthy reminder to continually wear a seat belt no matter how far I'm going. I remember vividly the moment directly after each accident. I gathered myself, looked around, felt my legs to make sure they were working, and then said to myself, ""there's no way that just happened."" In 127 Hours, Aron Ralston is put in a similar situation, except instead of getting in an accident, he falls down a cliff and instead of feeling around and realizing his legs are still working, he looks down to see his arm smashed and pinned directly under a huge rock. Regardless of the change in scenarios, both stories end with the same quote, ""there's no way that just happened.""127 Hours is based on the true story of Aron Ralston, a rebel, a rock climber, and a fully independent adult ready to take on the cliffs in Moab, Utah for a routine weekend excursion. He packs his things, hits the trails, and embarks on a beautiful journey by bike, but he makes one serious mistake- he tells no one where he's going before he leaves. Much of this is indicative of Aron's lifestyle which could be considered fly solo and by the seat of your pants. In his defense however, the story that's about to unfold is one of almost impossible calculations. He couldn't have seen it coming, but maybe it was just written in the stars.90% of the film takes place one on one with Aron, played by James Franco, as he's trapped inside the canyon walls. There's no special effects or camera trickery, just Franco, a camera, a slew of supplies which he happened to have on him during the accident, and of course us, the audience, watching every move the actor makes on screen. For Franco, this is an extremely personal film. We're on him for an hour and a half, close ups of his face, his eyes, his arm, his body, watching and writhing as he tries everything he can to survive. He plays the part extremely well, with every emotion striking through the rocks like a sharp nail. There's no way he will be denied a nomination for this performance at this year's Academy Awards.When I started reviewing this film, I wanted to open with the line, ""There's only one way to describe 127 Hours, and that word is awesome."" Then I got to thinking. There isn't just one way to describe this film, there's tons, and trust me, every way you turn it, the outcome is positive. This film is awesome, exhilarating, breathtaking, brutal, exhausting, and at times, almost impossible to watch. There's literally no way not to respond to this film, as there is no one in this world who could not sympathize for someone literally stuck under a rock, fully aware of their untimely predicament and the fact that they literally have no chance of getting saved or better yet, unstuck. It's like being fully aware in a vegetative state, but worse, because you can actually move, you're in 44 degree weather, and you're drinking your own urine to survive. It makes my stomach cringe just thinking about it.As other critics have already eluded to and anyone at least somewhat familiar with the film's story line already knows about, the final scenes in the film are almost impossible to watch without either A. fainting, B. leaving the theater, or C. having to turn your head. My father and I both opted for the turn of the head, but I saw multiple individuals (specifically females) who had to opt for option B for the lengthy 6 minute scene. It's shown in brutal detail, leaving nothing to the imagination, which in my opinion, wasn't totally necessary, but does add a sense of authenticity and accomplishment when it comes to what Aron has to do to get free.127 Hours is an amazing film. I've never felt so exhausted after leaving a theater. The very final moments of the film felt better than any film I've seen recently. I look up to Aron, not for being some sort of hero or even for being a genuinely good person, but for the fact that he went through the worst 5 days I could ever imagine, and survived.. It's one of the most amazing achievements I've ever heard a human make, and the way it was captured and brought to the screen can't receive any higher praise from me.127 Hours is a tough film to watch, but one that shouldn't be missed. It will be on my top 10 of the year, it's just a matter of what number.Michael Buffa Editor, Popcorn Jury http://www.popcornjury.com",127 Hours
288,CinemaFrostedBetty,A beautifully told story,8,16 May 2011,"Danny Boyle has always been a favorite of mine with his record of consistently making amazing films across the genres. Once again, he has kept up the flawless work with his latest film, 127 Hours (2010). James Franco gives an absolutely outstanding performance in this true story about a mountain climber, Aron Ralston, who becomes trapped inside a canyon when a boulder falls onto his arm. From here, we stick with Aron as he tackles the struggle of survival for the next 127 hours (We can thank elliptical editing for only having to sit through 94 minutes of this brutal attack by nature). To say it is a story of survival would be an understatement. It's a story of what it means to live—why we do the things we do, what's important, what isn't. It's about human will power, but Aron Ralston did not just suffer 127 hours of physical pain. This film takes us on an existential journey in discovering what his life truly meant to him. Despite the pain and suffering Aron must manage, we get to admire the beautiful cinematography. It's pretty safe to say that in the wrong hands, this film could have been a major let down—a lifetime movie, perhaps? Luckily, the visual imagery by cinematographers Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle will capture your attention and hold it for the length of the film. Their collaboration successfully captures the landscape's harsh beauty. The visual style most definitely supports the story telling. Aron may be pinned into immobile suffering, but the camera sure isn't. The constant movement works omnisciently, allowing us to understand every aspect of Aron's entrapment within the canyon and his conscience. Take my advice, go catch this flick, but bring your barf bag if you have a weak stomach!",127 Hours
289,dancer-91,A masterpiece,10,6 February 2011,"I just saw this film the second time. The first time, I cried multiple times. This time, I cried even harder. And it's not even your typical crying-movie.Aron Ralston was stupid enough not to tell anyone about his whereabouts when going to the Blue John canyons. He gets trapped by a boulder and his 127 hours of hell begin. He remembers his friends and family and the two girls he met before he was trapped. Can he make it out? Of course he will and we all know it, we know the story. And this film isn't about it. It's not about getting out of there, it's about the hours spent there and how he got out and what happened in those 127 hours.James Franco gives the performance of his life. He has always been good, but now he has achieved something every actor hopes to achieve - greatness. His portrait of Ralston is so vivid and realistic that it made me cry. I walked in the theater expecting some heart-breaking scenes of him crying and sobbing and promising to the camera to be a better man with piano music in the background. Instead I was given a realistic portrait of a man trapped and needing to get out and trying to do everything he can think of to keep his spirit up and his heart beating. Absolutely beautiful.Danny Boyle is an excellent director as well, he knows how to work his camera and create the feeling of being trapped, even though you never get trapped as the viewer, the camera-work is that good. It wasn't the story, but the camera-work and James Franco's performance that made me cry.I loved the use of split-screen, I would have used it a little less but it's still new and fresh. Although it reminded me of CSI:Miami...This is the movie of the year. I know the Best Actor Oscar probably goes to Colin Firth (not a bad thing, the bloke can act!) but I'm still hoping James Franco will get it. Just because of the scene where Aron interviews himself on camera. As I said, absolutely beautiful.",127 Hours
290,LinJason,Nothing less of an inspirational cinematic experience,9,20 February 2011,"Technically and inspirationally, this film has all the flair in instilling great cinematic moments that are often undermined by several. It's a film about a man being trapped in a fixed location for a little over 5 days, this is where Director Danny Boyle shows you how it can be made into a watchable 90 minute film that is worth every single cent of your ticket purchase.If you've seen how the film is made, you'd have known how much effort has been drafted into this production where a base camp is set in the middle of some wilderness and helicopters transport crew and equipment to and fro every shooting day. Cameras and their operators were set up with climbing ropes like mountaineers and one might say that this production could be one of the most demanding.So is the story and experience of Aron Ralston.Based upon the amazing true account of Ralston, this film is made in tribute to his courage to stand up against nature and allowing his will to live to outshine all adversary. Being trapped with a boulder pinning your right hand against the canyon walls inside the claustrophobic cracks of the Blue John Canyon isn't a situation that anyone will want to find themselves in.James Franco makes a terrific acting career performance and is probably by far the best we've seen of him. 127 Hours will definitely become his pivotal point as it allowed him to break free from conventional roles and portrayed one of the best sides to him that deserves watching. It's great to see him getting nods, even though people are pinning hopes on Colin Firth to eventually win. In my opinion, his rendition of Aron Ralston was very realistic and made me feel for him during the course of the film, which is what acting is all about - realism within fiction.Wait, it's more like achieving realism within realism.If you are thinking how watchable a film is when it merely depicts a man trapped within the cracks of a canyon for 127 hours under the screening time of about 90 minutes, my suggestion here to you is this.Just go watch it to immerse yourself in what is probably one of the best cinematic experience ever.Boyle has yet again proved his flair in filmmaking and it's exactly what makes him one of the best in the industry. He's already proved himself countless times especially with his previous winner ""Slumdog Millionaire"" and who doesn't love it when it took everyone by storm during its year of release?A visually stunning film that borrows from great editing and cinematography by Jon Harris and Anthony Dod Mantle/Enrique Chediak respectively. We see stylised treatment in the film with the occasional mesmerising landscapes of the canyons. Also not forgetting the original music by A.R. Rahman that made the entire 90 minutes so much more entertaining and enjoyable as a whole.127 Hours is a film that gets you deeply involved even after your step out of the theatre, thinking (or rethinking) about your life and the wonders of it. Often we tend to feel that we are in control of our lives but life is never simplistic enough for anybody to fully hold a good grasp upon. Here we see a talented Ralston who is so confident and full of life (and of himself in some manner) that he has always thought that navigating though life's mysteries and wonders under the most risky situations would be the best after-dinner desserts he could possibly have.That was before the element of nature came into play.Under the power of nature, man is belittled to a tiny speck of existential form as seen here in 127 Hours. Drastic climatic conditions, lack of food and water supply, lack of sleep, claustrophobic location, and eerie silence during most parts of the days and nights. What keeps a man going here will be his determination and will to live and survive. We see him talking to his video camcorder most of the times, his only companion to converse with that is also probably what keeps him sane.Ralston performs the unimaginable feat of severing his own right forearm, which is graphically portrayed in this film without ever showing much of him actually doing it through editing (it's a little gruesome in thought but if that's what bothering you, it's not a reason worth to skip this film). What's horrible rather, is the sound that we hear during the controversial scene, which brings one much closer to realism than the sight of it.So it's a battle between nature, Ralston, and his will to live, and it's one that you shouldn't miss for any reason at all.",127 Hours
291,AmazingAspie,This movie saved me.,10,24 September 2016,"There aren't enough words to describe how special 127 Hours is to me. It has saved me from depression and suicidal thoughts. Aron's story is amazing, and so is this movie. Everything about it is great. James Franco's performance in particular, steals the show. It's amazing how perfect he was. His range of emotions he portrayed are spectacular. There wasn't one bit where his performance was not believable. Danny Boyle's direction is excellent too. To me, no other could've pulled off this movie as good as he did. A.R. Rahman's score is perfect for this movie as well. I can literally go on and on about how good 127 Hours is.If there's one movie I'd recommend you to see, it's this one. I'm forever grateful I came across this movie. It's so powerful and inspiring.",127 Hours
292,travis36,Emotional to anyone that has ever ventured out,7,14 May 2018,"I just watched this movie for the second time and enjoyed it even more than the first time. Normally watching a true story a second time is anticlimactic knowing how it ends but this movie is not about a surprise or shock at the end but was purely a story of determination and survival. I read several reviews on this movie prior to writing this one and it was either loved or hated. I think it has to do with the viewers perspective. For me it was very emotional. That may be that I have hiked most of my life and can somewhat relate to the shock of realizing that something horrible has just happened and the process by which reality sets in. The heart of the movie for me was the emotional stages he goes through as he progresses through the emotions of shock, anger, fear, loss of reality, then resolute. To those that have never really ventured out or put themselves it possible danger one might think it was 2 hours of foolish self narrative. For anyone that has ever wondered about the limits of human determination this is a must watch. Give it a chance.",127 Hours
293,meeshoffmanns,"A Gripping, Gorgeous and Intimate Story with James Franco at his A-game",9,5 April 2019,"I stayed away from this movie for a long time, for the most obvious reason; I have a weak stomach and for anyone who knows this story ends, they might imagine why this movie is not for me. I decided to take a leap of faith, and watched it anyway. Despite it taking place in mostly one location, with only one character, this movie is so well written, shot and acted that you just keep watching. That makes including the end well worth it(still can't quite handle it).Acting:
James Franco as Aaron Ralston is absolutely great. Having to carry a movie all by yourself is a daunting task, but Franco does it effortlessly, providing a wide range of extreme emotions like fear, anger, depression, humor and joy at all the right moments. At the most difficult scenes he is so good that it is hard to believe that he is not actually going through all this.Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn as the two girls Aaron meets at the start are allright. Off course being in such a short portion of the movie, they can't show off that much, but are still quite delightful.The same goes for the handful of actors that appears in Aaron's flashbacks and visions; they all sell what they need to sell. Some deleted scenes give extra opportunity for this, and particulary Lizzy Caplan shines at these small moments.Direction:
Danny Boyle is known for his professionalism with actors and visuals, and always delivers on solid characters and their development. This is no exception. He always stays close to Aaron and makes sure that we feel just as trapped and desperate as he is. The use of flashbacks and hallucinations is also smoothly done, with peculiar choiches for lighting and camera position. It ensures that every such scene conveys a certain feeling that feels very different from the canyon we spend most of the time in.Cinematography:
This movie is gorgeous to watch; everything has a warm yellow haze over it, perfectly for the desert setting, contrasted with a deep, cold blue that makes you long for water and the outside world that Aaron can't reach. The use of lens flares is beautiful, and of spotlights imitating the slowly rising sun every day in the canyon. In regards to the position of the shots, a hand-held camera(from the real Aaron Ralston)is used to great effect to truly convey the slow decent into despair that Aaron experiences. Shaky-cam is used just as much as steadycam at the right moments to portray the emotional (in)stability at the right moments.Plot:
Guy gets trapped under a boulder in the lonely desert, and needs to get out or he'll die. How does he do that? It is not much to build a movie on, but the execution is done as well as possibly could. We first get a comfortable set-up, only to suddenly introduce the major inciting incident. The second act consists of attempts of Aaron freeing himself, intercut with his own tape-recordings and flashbacks, which add greatly to his character for his psyche and resourcefullness. The third act....well let's just say that it is one of the most difficult scenes to watch that you will ever encounter. It is greatly cathartic once you'll get through however, and by the end you feel just as relieved that the whole ordeal is behind Aaron.Music:
This movie has a very versatile soundtrack, with a lot of different styles and songs, used to great effect. Not sure if I would listen to it in my free time, but one or two songs definitely might appear on my playlist.Editing:
This is the hidden pillar of support of this movie: if this aspect fails, this movie would get boring very quickly. Through montages, flashbacks, hallucinations and all such things, intercut with Aaron in the canyon, the movie stays fresh most of the time and each time something new is revealed about the protagonist in a way we haven't seen before.Make-up:
The toll that the long time and malnourishment takes on Aaron is done very subtle and effective; his face pales, bags under his eyes, dry lips. The make-up department did a really good job for the little work that had to be done. Considering the trapped arm: even better. You believe what is happening to that arm. That is the highest praise I can give.Tone:
This movie is filled with adrenaline, even when the scene doesn't involve such things at all; it is because of the underlying knowledge that we know what eventually Aaron might be forced to do, and every minute takes us closer to that moment. Besides that, this movie is surprisingly effective in giving strong emotion and empathy for Aaron as we learn more about him and what brought the circumstances together that caused him to end up here.General Concensus:Despite its very simple premise and setting, Danny Boyle's approach and Franco's performance make this a wonderful experience, all the while backed up by a sense of impending dread and fear, culminating in an explosive finale.",127 Hours
294,viktorruspanov,10 out of 10,10,10 May 2020,One of the best films I've seen in my life. Very emotional and motivational movie witch can be starting point for people who gave up and disappointed in their lives.,127 Hours
295,squicker,So So But Unrewarding Film,6,23 January 2012,"So the film is the famous story of Aron Ralston, an American climber who goes on a canyon hike in Utah and comes acropper when his arm gets trapped by an 800lb boulder. After 6 days he realises he is going to have to take drastic action to ensure his escape. I felt this film was a bit of a mixed bag. Certainly the story felt very unnerving and haunted me long after the film had finished, this was due to the film capturing very well the isolation of the place Aron was trapped in. I also think the film did a very good job of highlighting what an idiot Aron was for getting into that predicament and how selfish he must have been around the time. It did this without making us dislike him too much, so I think it made a good balance out of his character. But I wasn't actively rooting for him as such, 1 - because I knew what happens anyway, and 2 - because whilst I'd not wish that on anyone, it's hard to root for him as it all transpires through his own foolishness, and there's a near infinite list of people who have met an untimely demise through no fault of their own. So we might perhaps consider them more 'deserving' of our sympathies. James Franco did a rather workmanlike job as Aron, showing he kept his head well in spite of what happened, and rallied himself for an escape on day 6 despite his weak and delusional state. But I felt disconnected from his character, in fairness this could be the direction, as Boyle is somewhat patchy IMO. The camera-work was excellent regarding the scenery and it really did ram home how desolate that place is and how insignificant a speck of nothingness is a human being, I thought that aspect of the film was superb. The editing however, good god...It was like MTV gone mad! I realise it's incredibly hard to make an engaging 90 min film with only one character, but the constant hallucinations and flashbacks with split-screen effect, well that was such a cheap way out of it and smacked of very immature film-making. A better director could have made that film work without any of the cheap gimmicks, because the story is highly unsettling and the stuff from which edge of your seat tension could be made, in the right hands. There is no message to the film, despite what anyone will tell you. It merely shows us that people are capable of tremendous deeds when their life is on the line - this is already well documented, and that human hubris can get you into trouble, again this is very well documented and I am sure many of us know this from our own experience. So, whilst I enjoyed certain aspects of the film, it was somewhat unfulfilling - certainly it's no 'Alive' or 'Touching the Void' - but I think this was down to the directing and nasty editing for the MTV generation.",127 Hours
296,gutsy_gibbon,A meritable performance of a real life lonely experience,8,30 January 2011,"Danny Boyle's cinematization of Aron Ralston's book about his real life experience of being stuck inside a canyon for five days was a laudable attempt. Overall, the movie was quite good with its pace, given that it has really one character for most of the movie.The opening and credits are not very clear on their meaning. Though it is not clear how participating in large crowds is related to the matter of the film, apparently, Boyle is attempting to show the ""human"" experience within large crowds.At any rate, James Franco's portrayal of the mountain climber being stuck in a lonely canyon with a boulder wedged across his arm and being unable to get out is very commendable indeed. He displays all the emotions that one would expect to experience when in such a situation. The way he remembers his past experiences with his friends and family is certainly something that many of us have felt to be the only thing that keeps us going when we are faced with loneliness. His performance deserved the Oscar nomination that it got. Whether he will go on to win the coveted award is anybody's guess.In many ways, this movie portrays things that most of us have experienced: the feeling of loneliness that never seems to go away , the feeling of being cramped inside a small space and the feeling that there is a big boulder on top of us that holds us back. When he says ""this boulder has been waiting for me all this time"", it is certainly something that many of us can identify with when we face big obstacles in the course of our daily lives. Under the present social conditions, due to long work hours and lack of free time, not all of us have the opportunity of actually socializing and forming social relations with people outside of work. Hence, this movie can be taken as an allegory to real life conditions that many of us have to go through: we do sometimes have to give an arm or leg to escape from loneliness and form lasting social relations.",127 Hours
297,awmurshedkar,127 Hours,9,15 May 2011,"127 HOURS – 9.3/10 Director: Danny Boyle Writer: Danny Boyle, Simon BeaufoyThe first film I saw of Danny Boyle's was Slumdog Millionaire and his third was 127 hours. From an ordinary, mainstream and clichéd director, he rose to the status of an extraordinary genius, ring master and a leader in his style of work. It was the brilliance of 127 hours and Trainspotting that led me to understand the master at work in Slumdog. It's a film worthy of discussion, and probably can teach you as much about direction as you would learn from a month long workshop.The story deals with the real life incident of trekker Aron Ralston , played exceptionally well by James Franco, who fell into a crevice in a remote canyon in Utah as a lose boulder came off and trapped his hand in the process. In my opinion, the subject the film deals with is the hardest to recreate as you are dealing with almost one subject for the entire length of the film, and here is the hardest part – your subject is stuck in one place. Boyle manages to do what no other director has dared or achieved to do thus far. Many survival stories have been made, but I remember none being so enigmatic and captivating for the entire duration of the film.Boyle uses several techniques from triptychs, zooming and split-screens to mash-ups and other beautiful original and inventive techniques. The challenge was to ensure that at no point, the film becomes static as the story had forced the subject to be. Audience attention span is limited and you can often lose them very quickly if nothing much transpires on screen for more than a few minutes. In this case, Boyle absolutely conscious of this fact, at all times, keeps the camera alive. There is almost a sense of desperation in the camera work, which in reality is actually conveying the trapped trekker's desperation. The film reflects what one could call Boyle's vivid and childlike imagination. In the hands of a serious story teller, this film could become another survival tale meant to pluck at those emotional strings, more suited for a Discovery Channel documentary than an hour and a half commercial relay. Boyle paints the film colorful, capturing every little detail one could possibly capture in a cramped crevice. James Franco, who has managed to raise standards for acting in survival films to a new high, is as much part of the charisma that Boyle creates with his breath-taking camera work. It is to be observed how Franco switches from a tormented trapped trekker unsure of what will happen in the next few hours to a mature, controlled and calm individual in control of the situation. Franco jokes around as though he was on television, and you can see the pain and realization, and the hopefulness lingering on his face and in his voice. Boyle does an excellent job of using, memories, flash-backs and hallucinations to build character and move the film forward.127 Hours is an achievement, a feat in itself. The very fact that such a difficult story was chosen shows extreme boldness and appetite for new challenges on part of the director. The film is arguably the best survival film I have seen. This proves so much that we don't need a lot of special effects and large budgets or exotic locations to make something worth your money. Three cheers for Danny Boyle!",127 Hours
298,groovybabe1992,127 Hours is amazing. It should have won a Oscar!,10,9 January 2011,"I heard about this film from the internet as I read the reviews from people in America and I found out that it was shown at the London Film Festival last year. I've seen this film twice and I really loved it both times. I never heard about this story before I heard about the film which a first for me. The plot is basically a guy called Aron Ralston who goes hiking in Utah and while hiking he falls when trying to decent into Blue John Canyon and his right hand gets trapped by a boulder which follows him when falling.This film had me on the edge of my seat as it was very gripping. I thought this film was powerful and extraordinary. I didn't watch the scene where he cuts off his hand the first time round because i don't like blood; The second time round, I was perfectly fine. I am a bit of a screamer type of person. James Franco gives a great performance as Aron as he is a really good actor and I think he is extremely good-looking. I also think that Danny Boyle was great directing the film as he kept the scenes of him stuck with the boulder going by adding the hallucinations and flashbacks that he suffers. His flashbacks that shows his past definitely show that he regrets what he has done in the past. Some of them flashbacks made me feel a bit emotional and they have made me think that I should appreciate what I have got in life. I also loved the music that was used in the film. I also loved his facial expressions in some scenes. He just made me giggle. I am totally in love with him now. I think Danny Boyle and James Franco should have won at award/Oscar this year for their performances within the film as 'Best Actor' & 'Best Director'.I were deeply shocked that film didn't get any awards. I actually bursted out in tears at the second time round of happiness and joy as he gets out of the canyon and gets rescued. The moral of this film is that you should always tell someone where you are going. That is why I am giving 127 Hours a 10 out of 10.",127 Hours

But anyway this guy aron was trecking through the canyon and he tries to climb down a narrow pass and then something horrible went wrong. Aron slips on a boulder and he falls with it and ends up getting his arm jammed between a rock and the canyon he was trapped for 5 days and the story displays the accurate description of a trapped rat.

The film keeps you hooked all the way through as we follow him as he has his accident and as he spends days trapped and begins to hallucinate. Your kept guessing as to how or even if he is going to get out of there alive as he is running dangerously low on food and water and he has not told anybody where he was going so there is no rescue coming. He is faced with 2 choices in the end he can die there or choose to live with a hard to watch scene of him amputating his own arm. Very gripping and very original. Well worth a watch!,127 Hours
301,rjwilliams5150,Another classic from Boyle,9,30 November 2012,"Director Danny Boyle's no stranger to producing ground breaking movies, stylishly shot, pounding soundtracks, involving plots and great characters, and '127 Hours' adds to his great resume.The incredible true story of climber Aron Ralston (James Franco) who whilst exploring the isolated canyons of Utah, slips and find's himself pinned to a canyon wall by a boulder.The hours go by, these turn to days, his water is running out, he come's to the realization that the only way to escape will be to cut his own arm off....with a blunt pocket knife.There are similarity's to the excellent 'Buried' but this is a different kind of film as we experience flashbacks into Aron's past, how he became a selfish 'loner', he makes a video diary, expressing his regrets at not caring for others as much as he should have.Franco is excellent, the scene when he films an imaginary talk show with himself is brilliantly acted and also a great comedy moment.Don't let the subject matter put you off (yes it will make you wince-the sound effect when he cuts through a nerve!!!!) this is a great film, finely acted and beautifully shot, and in some sort of sense, a feel good flick!",127 Hours
302,at7000,"I could barely watch this. However, it is a great film.",10,7 November 2011,"This is one of the most intense films I have ever watched. I'm not squeamish, but had my eyes averted perhaps during 10% of the film. I almost quit watching it and thought about turning off the DVD several times during the film. I can say this about many films that I have disliked, but this it the first time I can say that about a film I really thought was great.It is so real, almost like a documentary. They wanted to cast Cillian Murphy for their first choice as the lead. All I can say is thank god for that failing, and Franco taking the part. Nothing against Murphy, but this is one of those films where the lead just nails it perfectly. I could not imagine any other actor doing as well as Franco in this role. There are quite a few films where the first choice fell through, and the second or third choice just nailed it. Brando was second choice for The Godfather! They wanted Lawrence Olivier, but he was too old and sick to commit to it.In any case, this film could not have been done any more brilliantly, honestly and accurately. The first scene with the two girls was ""Hollywoodized"" but the rest of the film is dead on accurate. Ralston said so himself. The Southwest is amazing, I have lived there and hiked a fair amount of it. The scene with the electrical storm was perfect. I have seen week after week, month after month, of nothing but sunshine, cloudless skies, and beautiful, consistently dry, sunny weather- And then an electrical storm from hell, will form out of nowhere, and hit brutally hard in less than 20 minute's time. Often with golf-ball size hail. It's one of the best scenes in the film.",127 Hours

Thinking about past joys, thinking of cool drinks and delicious foods, thinking about past mistakes, including not answering his mother's call... The film well portrayed Aron's thoughts, Aron was captivated by the sense of freedom he saw in that bird, the feeling of an ant walking on his knife, ... I have to say that the choice of music, which was played by Aron's sister, that is, a piece by Frederick Chopin, was very clever and professional. As far as I know, Chopin himself came up with such thoughts when he was sick in bed, and this resemblance, that is, Chopin's attitude to life, and the thoughts that Aron recreates with Chopin's piece is really really amazing...",127 Hours
304,heyanerd,What Would YOU Do???,9,8 March 2011,"The only reason I vote this film so highly is because of the real circumstances it was based around. It is inspiring in a way that I have seen in sports dramas, but those aren't life and death. It makes you think about what you would do in a similar situation. No, you may not be a Canyoner, but if there is ever an event where your arm is pinned down by something heavy and you may be able to survive but only if you use your all and make a sacrifice, you wouldn't have to be a person who skips around canyons for fun, would you?What surprises me most about this film is that it keeps you on edge with lots of quick shots and camera variances, all while inter-cutting flashbacks and hallucinations. Hell, I haven't read up on whether or not Aron Ralston had these instances or not, but you've got to think, how else would your mind be working under such duress? We all know Danny Boyle likes to get flashy and artsy on us, but keep in mind that we think in such ways also. We illuminate and dampen and imagine and hallucinate whether or not we are 'artsy-fartsy' types.As a true story, it's incredible and inspiring. As a film, it will keep you awake and alive. Why 9 out of 10 instead of 10 out of 10? Truth is, real life did half the work, even including Ralston's own video footage of himself which actor James Franco studied in order to accurately capture the gravitas of the ordeal. So it being a true story is what I feel really makes it such a good movie.Well worth the watch.",127 Hours

It meant nothing at first because I hadn't watched this movie before. but when I read up about it, I thought that it a creative and funny reference.This movie does get a bit boring and drags on for a bit too long, so much so that it begins to taunt you. The amazing performance by James Franco really puts you in shoes of his character (Aron Ralston). You become as scared as he is, and start to think like he does. What am I going to do? how am I going to get out? Am I going to live?This movie just puts these questions in you head and it drags on for so long it starts to really annoy you. Its not the movie that I want to really see again since I know what happens and the whole suspense is broken. I would however recommend this movie to people to watch. It really messes with your emotions and shows you just how grateful you should be and take every opportunity and live your life to its fullest.",127 Hours
306,kalel41,between a rock and a hard place,9,29 November 2010,"Watching the first 30 minutes of 127 hours is like bathing your senses with the great outdoors. Watching the last 30 minutes is like a dream where your senses are numbing slowly only to be jolted once again with a charge of redemption. Danny Boyle captures the exhilaration of an outdoor adventure in such beautiful and creative ways. Its all a fun ride until our hero Aron falls in to a crevice and gets his arm stuck between a boulder and the cavern wall. Here is where he has his big oops moment, because you see, Aron never told anyone where he was going and for how long. On top of that he forgot his one essential tool, the ''Swiss army knife"". Which later would have come in great use when he cuts his own arm off. Oh yes, he does and its gruesome. (but not to the point where anyone would faint. I've heard the stories and I don't get it, its not that bad.) It is here where his journey of survival begins. As he hallucinates and ponders on all the things that he done in his life, the girl he loved, and the family he'll miss. We the audience can't help but question ourselves, what would we do? Based on the unbelievable true story of Aron Ralston, ""127 hours"" is a rousing achievement in film making. Its a gorgeous looking film yet under the direction of Danny Boyle it definitely has an Indie touch. You know you're going to see something different. Much of the time is spent with James Franco's character and for this reason he has to be completely present and captivating. Franco's knocks it out of the park, he is fantastic in this role and does an amazing job taking us on his character's emotional roller coaster ride. A.R. Rahman joins Boyle for the second time and nails the music. It has a wonderful soundtrack. This fantastic true tale of human survival and the power to live in not to be missed! *for more no nonsense, honest and thoughtful reviews check out THE-TICKING-TICKET...is the movie worth your time. www.tickingticket.blogspot.com",127 Hours
307,patrick_dn,Unbelievable storyline,5,8 January 2011,"Strange that no one has pointed out that the basis around which this story evolves (the cutting off of the arm) is hardly believable. First, you'll probably bleed to death since many important arteries and veins pass through the arm. If you can't bind or burn the ends of the blood vessels you've cut, they are unlikely to stop bleeding. Secondly, if you cut yourself, you feel an intense pain, even after feelings of numbness due to dehydration or hunger. What then if you chop off your entire arm!? Thirdly, the tensors (and the bone) in the arm are very resilient, even with a good knife. And fourth, what about infections? You can hardly say he cut his arm off in hygienic circumstances! To conclude: I really don't believe the bit in the story where he amputates his arm and lives to tell the story. This guy probably had a severe infection in his arm in the middle of nowhere, got it amputated or did it himself in other than the in the film mentioned circumstances and made the rest up. Untruthfull story!",127 Hours
308,pizzazzman2000,The Boyle-Rahman bandwagon goes beyond expectations!,9,18 February 2011,"Ever since we jumped onto the Boyle-Rahman bandwagon 2 years ago with Slumdog Millionaire, even back then, at least for me, it was hard to fathom the combined strength of this duo. Which brings me back to an amazing concept pointed out by Napoleon Hill called the ""mastermind group""....which literally states that the combined mind powers of a group can generate enough energy and force which is greater than the individual strengths of any single mind. And this is one work by the master duo of Boyle and Rahman which establishes a vibrant and dominant punch,just like Slumdog. The directorial ingenuity of Boyle, added to the musical grace of Rahman, throws them into the ring of other brilliant contemporary directors.A nicely directed film with a prefect plot which reverts close to the actual reality. Sure, Boyle by himself is a maestro in his entirety, and for the heck of it I'm being repetitive here, but Rahman has also always been worth more than his salt, but a killer combination or fusion of the Boyle-ian and Rahman-ian elements generated a power worth more than the common mind could fathom. As far as I was affected, I haven't come across a movie like this which not only grabs you by the throat right into its heart, but dials-up your emotions that you begin to experience something on the likes of anxiety, panic attacks, fear, and all those essential feelings which make it almost impossible for you to stick to your seats and watch with the normal relaxation you would expect. Definitely I would not recommend this movie for the weak-hearted.But how does the Boyle-Rahman formula actually come into play? Sure, we could have removed Rahman and had still a gripping tale which makes our eyes pop out when we see the challenging and grueling battle against the natural elements of isolation, heat , plus the addition of a dwindling water supply and food supply, which Aron has to play out. But the brilliance of the genius in a director combo is truly evaluated by its ability to hide your mind from the reality - the reality that this is acting and not fact. The true brilliance is felt when it draws you under its covers so much, that you begin to feel the powerful emotions which the main protagonist goes through. So much so, that the viewer is drawn into a totally new ""reality"", a reality non-existent. In other words, for those few minutes, the mind cannot even realise that none of this is real. I, for starters, during those ""gory"" moments, found myself unable to keep still, and kept moving around in my seat, wondering how anyone could actually carry that out! Of course, on closer analysis, it's evident that it's not just what is projected on the screen which triggers this adrenalin rush, and makes one register on the emotional richter scale, but also the music eclat which really helps manifest the true plight, emotions, agony, challenge, despair,faced by Aron Ralston, and even more, bring all these beyond the big screen and actually inject these feelings into us! A brilliant job by Rahman........kudos to you!All it takes is your musical genius to give this movie a white-knuckle finish and make us actually ""live"" it!A truly daedal killer scheme for direction and music.Of course, the 127 Hours effect wouldn't be complete without giving true commendation to James Franco's brilliant acting. Thorughout the film, his professional brilliance and dexterous acting never let up which themselves contribute to creating a riveting appeal for the film. This becomes particularly eminent when the climax of the film begins to surface, that is, from the moment Aron gets trapped in the canyon unable to free his arm. The novelty of the portrayal of his flashback memories becomes clear when it becomes hard to decipher exactly the points when Aron drifts from reality into flashback and back. Being part of the audience, it was very difficult for my mind to get a handle on what was reality and what was hallucination. This is the combined work of the direction and cinematography which go hand in hand to create such an effect on the mind that the line between the reality and imagination on the screen gets totally blurred!I can positively say, beyond the shadow of doubt, that Boyle and Rahman provide a holistic approach towards their own creation or rather genre which helps stir up those emotions that put our minds right in the heart of the film and make us live those powerful moments. And nice work, which has generated enough Oscar buzz that it remains to be seen how well it can compete against the other potential candidates. This is one film which speaks of novelty on all fronts - direction, cinematography, music, and last but not least, star acting!And if we thought Slumdog Millionaire was gung-ho enough, we now realise that Boyle and Rahman are crossing over towards the pinnacle of their success as a duo.",127 Hours
309,helperzine,A unique and daring film about a unique and daring real-life experience,7,22 April 2012,"This is a film about a man who is trapped for 127 hours in a canyon. Why, I won't say. It's for you to find out. Naturally, during that time, not much can happen. So, the concept of flashbacks becomes necessary. This could have been an average film, but a brave director decided he wanted to do something better. Danny Blabla deserves praise for making a cohesive film from what could have been a huge mess. The cinematography is managed by BUbuBLAbla and he deserves recognition for using very sleazy and uncomfortable camera-work to elicit the necessary emotion from the viewer. James Franco deserves a round of applause for making a potentially very embarrassing role to see, into something touching. These three men managed to dangle on the fine line between making a loose and off-beat film and making a useless and depressing film. The writer should be noted for filling time-gaps with a satisfying storyline.",127 Hours

Being a scout I've always been interested in survival and stuff like that so this film ticked all the boxes for me. When I first watched this film I felt as though I was watching the real Aron Ralston trapped under that rock, it was very realistic. Its so accurate that even Aron himself said so. Furthermore James Franco's performance in this film is outstanding it was as if in it he was cutting his own actual arm off. I would recommend this to anyone who has seen and enjoyed films like alive and other survival films. Also don't watch the end bit unless you have a strong stomach.",127 Hours

312,meininky,A Triumph,10,17 November 2010,"Sometimes (even oftentimes) in the world of film criticism, the word ""triumphant"" is thrown around. It's often used to describe a film, perhaps more often a performance. I've certainly used it; it's a term I like to pull out when a film seems to go beyond the call of duty. When it's more than art, entertainment, or a combination of both. When the story, images, and characters pop off the screen and go with you, and the lasting impression left on you means something more than having killed a couple hours in a big, dark room with a bunch of strangers. Now, after watching 127 Hours, I feel I've never used ""triumphant"" in the correct critical context before.James Franco's performance is simply astounding. He, as an actor, is triumphant because his character is, and because he delves into what it means to be bringing this incredible story to life on the big screen for mass consumption. This is a tough role - Franco is basically putting on a one-man show, and he does so elegantly. We feel Aron Ralston's pain because Franco feels his pain and shows it in every line of his face, verbalizes it with every sigh, and lets it control him even as he battles to take control back and find a way out of his dire situation.It's pure, masterful art. Franco is simply flawless. Trapped by the boulder, much of his performance lies in his facial expressions, and he is able to deftly switch from desperation to comedy to a brutal will to survive, all while being barely able to move. I've rarely been so impressed by an actor's work; Franco is wholly deserving of the Oscar.Danny Boyle's kinetic, energetic direction is a perfect match for Franco's easy-going goofiness, and even when the film becomes grounded in the narrow canyon where Ralston was trapped, Boyle always keeps things interesting. He and co-writer Simon Beaufoy weave flashbacks and hallucinations into Ralston's dilemma to great, heart-breaking effect, and the premonition that drives Ralston to finally dive whole-heartedly into amputating his own arm is breath-taking in its tenderness.Also impressive is Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle's cinematography. Instead of letting the confined space limit their camera techniques, they tackle every possible angle, often bringing the audience uncomfortably close to the action. Shots through the bottom of Ralston's water bottle mark time and heighten the sense of urgency. The addition of home movie-style footage brings Ralston even closer to the audience; when he expresses his delayed gratitude to his family, you'll likely find yourself thinking about the last time you told your parents how much you love them. It's a great device, and is put to best use in one of the film's funniest scenes, when Ralston interviews himself Gollum-style. The combination of the dark humor, varied cinematography, and Franco's impressive facial dexterity pitch the scene perfectly; it's a lighter moment that is nevertheless grounded in the gravity of the situation.Complementing and combining Chediak and Mantle's beautiful shots is Jon Harris's dynamic editing. The use of split-screen is particularly brilliant, put to use in innovative ways throughout the film: the bookend sequences mark Ralston's departure from and return to society, and the technique in general represents the multiple facets of a seemingly simple tale. Yes, when it comes down to it, 127 Hours is a film about a mountain climber who gets stuck under a boulder and has to cut off his own arm. But it's so much more than that. It's about a man overcoming the physical, emotional, and intellectual strains of an unthinkable situation. It's about responsibility, love, and the will to live. Above all, it's about the triumph of the human spirit, show more clearly and beautifully here than in any other film I can think of.",127 Hours
313,chf_2258,Well told story,7,7 February 2011,"I'm giving this an 7 but will probably never watch it again; mainly because this is not a complex thriller or a well-written comedy. Just a very well-told story. Furthermore, I dislike the idea of someone capitalizing off of one's own irresponsible actions (especially cuz it ain't me). But, this movie met the challenge of turning this 20 minute news-magazine segment into a mostly engaging feature film. Franco is awesome and, as I far as I know, the story isn't embellished for the big screen. So, if you want to see a story that actually answers one of those ""What would you do if you...."" questions we've all considered, you won't be disappointed.I decided to add this to those reviewers who said this movie moved slowly at times; ummmmm.....this man was stuck, alone, in a canyon for five days! Were you expecting some witty banter or maybe some car chases? Imagine, in today's culture, being without distractions for one hour let alone five days. In fact, it may have been justified for the director to have added 5 minutes of him just staring at some ant or crevice.",127 Hours
314,ecstatic-tickle,Ouch! My arm!,8,19 January 2011,"Everyone who watches 127 Hours goes into the movie knowing that the guy cuts off his arm in the endbut what you might not expect is the wide spectrum of emotions and imagery that his journey to get there encompasses. The sense of discomfort waiting for *that* scene is palpable in an audience throughout the running time, but there's also the sense of discovery and life-affirming joy that the film's fantastic direction evokes.Danny Boyle brings the same kinetic energy to the material as he did with the likes of Trainspotting and Slumdog Millionaire - there's always been a confidence about his filmmaking that can either come off exhilarating or obnoxious, luckily here he strikes the former. From the opening scenes of Ralston setting off for his journey (without telling anyone where he's going I might add) Boyle employs split-screen visuals and a pumping tune to bring the audience along for the ride, as he takes with him only a few supplies and a handycam to record his trip to the desert near Moab, Utah.Franco's spirited portrayal of a thrill-seeking adventurer brings to mind the same carefree energy of Into the Wild's Christopher McCandless - another ill-fated young explorer, played by Emile Hirsch. Tearing through the desert on his bike, Ralston falls to the ground and without pausing snaps a shot of himself smiling on the ground. There are some really dynamic camera tricks, like placing the camera inside the straw as he takes a sip of water. He encounters two rather irritating girls, novice climbers for whom he serves as guide for an afternoon, taking a plunge into the rock pool with them and then going on his way.""We probably didn't even figure in his day"" the girls quip as he walks off. However, before too long Ralston is shouting their names from the fault line into which he has fallen. The moment the rock hits and he gets painfully wedged between it and the wall, bam - the title card ""127 Hours"" - a good 15 minutes into the film, a very sly move on Boyle's part. After much grunting and cursing, Ralston realises the severity of his situation, and so lays out his inventory - trying to formulate some kind of plan.He begins by trying to chip away at the rock with the blade of the cheap multi-tool he has with him. There is a moment early on when he drops the knife somewhere quite out of reach - and the audience, knowing what's coming, secretly hope that he can never pick it up. But alas, he does - and in fact attempts to sever his arm with the dull blade far earlier than you might expect, but to no avail.Ralston soon settles into a routine - recording his thoughts on the handycam every day - observing a raven that flies overhead each morning, the sunlight as it shines down into his fault line for fifteen minutes a day, and the few blissful moments he can bathe his ankle in it. Some music choices almost seem too upbeat and undercut the seriousness of the situation, Danny Boyle often (as he has in the past) places the need to keep an audience superficially entertained over the need to honour the grim reality of story.Ralston becomes resourceful in his fight for survival, constructing an elaborate pulley with ropes and connecting devices, trying with all his might to pull the rock out, but failing. On the Tuesday morning, he tapes himself hosting a kind of light-hearted TV chat show - interviewing himself about his current predicament. Entertaining as this enthusiastic schizo-dialogue might be, it stretches belief that he'd have so much energy after that many hours of dehydration.He begins to have dreams, remembering times with the French girl-that-got-away, played by the alluring Clémence Poésy, and also experiences hallucinations - including a rain shower that turns into flash flood - a spectacular sequence that sees Ralston floating to freedom as the rock comes loose in the rush of water, defying audience expectation before returning to him in his actual circumstance. Some of the flashbacks and illusions are a little heavy handed, as to be expected with Danny Boyle - but for the most part serve the movie well to take us out of the confined setting.As Ralston situation becomes more dire and he seems to be facing into death, his body is drained, becoming so dehydrated that he resorts to drinking his own urine, that same camera inside the straw now rising with a yellow liquid. ""It's no Slurpee"" Franco observes ""it's like a bag of p*ss"" Pushed to his physical and psychological limits, he makes the decision to sever his arm. He begins to have heart palpitations, and stabs himself in the arm out of frustration. Once again Boyle cuts to one of his novelty internal camera angle - this time we see the point of the blade hitting the bone. He begins breaking these bones, and it's out with the blade again - slitting skin, ripping tendons, blood everywhere - the soundtrack underscoring the pain.Despite how graphic the scene is, he's taking the necessary action to break free and it is truly a cathartic moment after so many scenes of struggle and hopelessness. Eventually, he emerges with only a red stump remaining - climbing out into the sunlight, having lost one arm - but gaining immeasurable wisdom from his experience. The struggle is over and has felt real thanks Franco's commitment to the character's plight and Danny Boyle's inventive direction. 127 Hours is an uncomfortable ride, but one worth taking, as long as you're not too squeamish.",127 Hours
315,Paranoyia,I'm feeling confused,1,30 January 2011,"Just like the infamous Confused Matthew I'm feeling confused about this movie. Why does it get so high of a score?I knew right from the start this movie was going to be an awful experience. I knew right from the start it had two ingredients that would kill this movie for me. Firstly it is based upon real event, and an interpretation of real events is always such a delight to witness. And secondly it was about a guy talking to himself for ninety five percent of the movie. To me even one of those two reagents is a no go.But alas I was in a way dragged in to see it, nothing I could do about it. And the reason I hated this movie so much wasn't because of the two constructs established, but a third I wasn't aware of before a movie ended. If it hadn't been for the third thing I wouldn't even waste my time on writing a review.And the third thing is: it tries to convey a wrong message, and does so poorly!There is a fundamental difference between being a loner and being an idiot. And our beloved protagonist played by Jim Franco is exactly both. But the funny thing is that the movie blames all his misfortunes not on him being an idiot, but rather on him being a loner.I am a cynical loner myself. You could argue about my level of intelligence, but in all of my individualism I would never go mountain or cave climbing alone, without telling my relatives my exact route, estimated times of arrival at each checkpoint, and bringing both a long- range mobile phone and GPS along with a massive amount of supplies with me.And that anti-hero of ours does neither of those things! And what does he blame it all on? Ooh, he's a lone hero, he doesn't need anyone. No, no, he's not stupid, he's just a loner. Ugh, what a load of bull.And the way they shove this idiotic notion in our faces is anything but subtle. That's why as I said earlier it tries to convey a wrong message poorly. That's about it when the movie becomes a total pile of steaming junk, culminating at the end. Else I could at least let them score a point for telling an idea, albeit a wrong one in a right way.This movie is nothing more than another piece of societal propaganda, preaching and forcing their morals and values on us, the individuals. But don't believe a word I say without proof. Watch it and judge for yourself, but approach it very carefully, as such movies are dangerous.",127 Hours
316,jimmy_james777,Another Danny Boyle film that you'll love!,8,25 August 2012,"I liked it, wasn't one of my favourites but it was a unique film. I am a fan of Danny Boyle's work as he creates such colourful and eventful films, 127 Hours was no different. I really enjoyed how we as an audience felt like we were in the mind of the trapped mountain climber, Aron and it allowed the audience to be engaged greatly! However, this movie has the bloodiest scene I have ever seen! You've been warned.My favourite character was Aron Ralston.(James Franco) Rven though he's in like 99% of the movie, you have to love him! He's crazy, bubbly, outgoing, fun, wild. He will be riding his bike at a crazy speed and then fall over and then laugh and take a picture of it. I loved the scenes where he met the girls as he is crazy around them, but kind. He's funny but doesn't make the girls uncomfortable. When he is going insane after being trapped for days, he starts pretending he is on a talk show as he speaks to the video camera. He was interesting regardless of the fact he was either dead or had to lose his armI would recommend it to young adults, not young teens or kids, as they most likely will get bored from it for they won't comprehend what is happening and also because of the bloody scene. But anyone else, it's a must watch!These kind of movies are often the hardest one to create. Because you're writing about one situation at one place and you need to stretch it out into an hour and a half film while keeping the audience interested. Danny Boyle and James Franco succeeded while not straying away from what really happened. The movie had ups and downs, highs and lows and that added to the realism of the film. Feeling like we were in the mind of Aron, added to the film's tension!",127 Hours

318,jayanthanr,Inspiring,7,10 December 2013,"I entered the cinema prepared for what I will go through. A story of a person, Aron Ralston, trapped in canyon for 5 days. The story told in a big canvas to bring out his grief and self-pity lines. I couldn't be more wrong.For a movie with such a premise, it starts of with an amazing musical split screen shots. The first few minutes are a real treat to the eyes, and you get loads of that treat throughout the movie. Split screens, orange sand, the bluer skies and the bluest waters, the visuals just leave you gasping for more.Danny Boyle doesn't waste time getting into the real story, and the expected fall happens unexpectedly to the viewer with no drama or a dramatic score. There is a brilliant musical score, but silence has been used to a good effect. Surprisingly, once Aron is trapped with the boulder, its not tears and pity all the way. There is humor, self- analysis, struggle, desperation, frustration, planning – a bouquet of human emotions. There is also a point in the film, where even in the deepest hour of crisis Aron is tempted to pleasure himself. I haven't read the book by Aron Ralston, but the movie definitely makes you feel like you are seated in front of him during his crisis. James Franco deserves accolades for his brilliant performance. It's astonishing to see Danny Boyle come out with this amazing biopic, after an India Cinema inspired pot boiler. The narration and the detailing is praise worthy. A R Rahman's music is different and sets the mood of the film. The score is more emotional at times and uses a lot of other composers' tracks.There is a very hard and disturbing scene, of about few moments, towards the end of the movie which would not be suitable for very weak hearted people. Discount that, this is movie of true hope and courage. Loved the movie. Don't miss this one.",127 Hours

I couldn't help but fall for his character right away, just like the likable Aron Ralston did years before when I first saw his story while working in the news television history.I couldn't help but try to compare his performance with Tom Hank's in Cast Away. Could just watching this guy stock under a rock for 90 minutes hold my attention? Well, this movie was a bit different. There were flashbacks and other movie trickery used to fill time and get us into the mind of Ralston instead of just letting Franco let us in through his performance.

321,mdtscoates,127 HOURS - Danny Boyle right on the money,9,24 November 2010,"I came into this movie with high expectations. Danny Boyle, who brought us 28 DAYS LATER and SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE had a lot to live up to with the quality of prior movies, and he did not disappoint. He brought the challenge of creating an interesting movie based on our main character being immobile to life, and captivating it was. Being stuck with our main character the entire duration of the film was anything but tedious, as we follow the thoughts of canyoneer Aron Ralston (James Franco) as he gets trapped under a rock while exploring the beautiful sights of Utah. The camera does a fabulous job taking us everywhere a wandering mind might migrate in a situation such as this.The human connection element was most fascinating, as we wonder what we would do if placed in a similar situation. We are really ""with"" Ralston on his journey, as we see him discover a reason to live and how his life perspective changes, not just how to get free from his predicament. The film manages to stay optimistic and warming, despite the frustration and angst felt by Ralston and viewers. And we certainly thank Boyle for some of the lighter moments that temper the severity of the situation.The film does not shy away from tough choices and certainly keeps it ""real"" during the entire run, especially during the critical climax scene. Despite being stuck in place the movie is fascinating at the pace with which it moves and keeps the audience's attention from start to finish. So while Ralston loves living on the edge, we see Boyle create this movie in a similar fashion, metaphorically speaking, as the intensity and gripping nature of Ralston's circumstances comes alive and sucks us in.In the movie Aron Ralston sets off on a typical weekend excursion being outdoors and with nature. During his journey he befriends a couple of female hikers who are somewhat lost and looking to get back on their way. He shows them the ropes of the canyons and they set off home. Little do they know that their friend will need their help just moments later. Becoming trapped under a rock, Ralston now is faced with the challenge of keeping himself alive while trying to break loose from the rock's firm grasp. As Aron works on a solution, we see him wonder about the party he's been invited to just hours earlier, think about how his has ignored his family, wonder about where he left his Gatorade, which would keep him hydrated longer, do a live interview featuring himself on camera, and drink his own urine.I think the part of the movie that moved me the most actually occurred after the climax, where we see Ralston, broken, desperate, and willing to end his lone-wolf mentality for good. The emotions felt during the last 5 minutes signify human triumph, perseverance, and the power of the human spirit. Incredible movie, a definite must-see 9/10 stars",127 Hours

323,widsith-58602,"A mixture of true-life horror, endeavor and salvation, and just excellent.",8,14 September 2015,"IF YOU KNOW THE BASIC STORY, THEN THE SPOILER IS OBVIOUS AND THIS REVIEW WON'T AFFECT YOUR VIEWING.This is the story of how Aron Ralston survived five days trapped in a remote Utah canyon, one arm pinned under a tumbled boulder. Great craft is shown here, both in engaging the audience's interest and holding onto it for two hours. It succeeds, not least because of James Franco's performance as the happy-go-lucky adventurer whose world view is profoundly changed by his experience – facing, he believed, certain death but without loosing his cool, then being 'reborn' when he managed to cut through his own right arm and survived.I'm not a particular fan of Danny Boyle, but this is a case of the director, story and casting being perfectly matched (including the real Aron Ralston being on set throughout filming, advising Boyle and Franco on how things should be portrayed). The severing of the arm is show very graphically – one knows it is a studio prop he's cutting through, but it is still gut-wrenching to watch, yet one can't imagine the tale being as effectively any other way.The only major departure from true events is when Ralston goes swimming in a hidden canyon lake with two girls whom he happens to meet on the trail. In reality they simply passed by, but Boyle extrapolated from this occurrence to illustrate the self-centered and hedonistic existence Ralston lived before his accident. Ralston approved of the final cut, saying that it was as close to the truth as anything made for commercial release could be.The lessons from the film are simple ones – the value of human relationships, and that if you're off somewhere remote, tell someone where you're going! Ralston now earns a living as a motivational speaker, but still spend all the time he can climbing mountains and going on other adventures. I walk in the hills occasionally, always alone, so this film touched a chord. Plus it involves rocks! As a geology buff, this always gives something a bit of extra cudos. Well done Danny.",127 Hours

Starting with a sound track designed to rattle windows on Mars and an introduction which, far from exciting my anticipation, had me wondering if i was in the middle of another film altogether. It must have been difficult to make this film stand up with such a limited story line,resultingly there is continual 'padding-out' which certainly drained my interest. Not very often i find myself nodding off in the middle and looking at my watch. Slumber was however difficult with the music beating heck out of my eardrums. The flash backs really were a nonsense, i mean,was the director trying to force me to tears. ( He failed on that score ) By comparison ' Touching The Void ',a similar theme, was much more successful. Trying to sum up as the credits scrolled down at the end, i came to the conclusion that this was some sort of rock/pop music suite which used the moving image as an accompanying instrument. OK, it had it's moments but for me it would have needed both arms trapped by that boulder to make it watchable.",127 Hours

In all honesty, I wasn't expecting much from this film. I only purchased tickets for its screening because it was one of the few ""premium screenings"" that wasn't sold out (I was originally excited for Black Swan and Hereafter, both of which were sold out after the first day of ticket sales). I was only looking forward to the festival experience. I had already heard about the heroic story of Aron Ralston-- the true life-or-death experience that the film was based on-- and after hearing about the upcoming film, I must admit that I laughed quite a bit. I thought it would be a pathetic plot for a film, and that it would get nowhere at all. Was I ever wrong with my predictions! While viewing ""127 Hours"", my low expectations were gradually surpassed. My final thoughts on the film soared way above my original ones. I've never been so surprised in my life. For those of you who are oblivious, ""127 Hours"" is about the true story of a mountain climber named Aron Ralston, whose arm was trapped under a boulder during a solitary canyon expedition in Utah. Although some people may consider this a SPOILER, I must tell you that the film focuses on his deepest thoughts, leading up to the moment where he resorts to severing his own arm in order to survive. Nevertheless, the whole audience was thrilled by this film, even though everyone was aware of the man's fate beforehand (Aron Ralston was presented on stage before the film was shown). Right from the start, I was captivated and intrigued. And I wasn't alone; the entire audience was as immersed as I was. Every so often, the film would have the whole audience gasping, cringing, or laughing-- all in unison. And then there was the moment where James Franco's character finally cut off his entire arm. The whole audience clapped, instantly. Everyone was blown away, mesmerized. Danny Boyle excels in directing, as usual. I loved ""Slumdog Millionaire"", so it was nice to see that he teamed up with the same screenwriter, Simon Beaufoy, on this project. I was particularly blown away by their ability to craft a film (""127 Hours"") that stars one man (James Franco) and that is mainly shot in one restrained location (a gap in the canyon), while managing to captivate the audience. Wow. This marks a ground-breaking achievement in filmmaking. The viewer's interest is maintained throughout the whole film, thanks to the emotional glimpses of his deepest thoughts during all the suspense over his survival. It manages to be one of the most poignant, heartfelt stories of this year's cinema, while also being one of most thrilling and intense. It really puts you on the edge of your seat! James Franco delivers an OUTSTANDING performance as Aron Ralston. He is so convincing that you can't help but slip into his shoes and feel the pain and suffering he is experiencing. He also manages to get numerous laughs out of the audience with little bits of humour here and there. I wouldn't be surprised if he snags an acting nomination at next year's Academy Awards, among all the other categories that this film is likely to contend in. In the theatre, as the credits began to roll, the whole audience participated in a standing ovation that was sustained for five minutes. It was the greatest film reaction I have ever witnessed. Danny Boyle, Simon Beaufoy, James Franco, Aron Ralston, and a few others took the stage afterwards to answer questions from the audience. They were very grateful of the wonderful reception this film got that night. Leaving the theatre, I had the opportunity to share my thoughts on the movie with the distributor, Fox Searchlight. They recorded my friend Shakyl-- also a cinephile-- and I, and asked us some questions on the movie. The footage will possibly be used in a promotional commercial! We'll have to see! Overall, Danny Boyle's ""127 Hours"" is a masterful film that will blow away all audiences when it will be released in November. You really can't afford to miss this deep, intense, powerful, and emotional piece of cinema! It will always remain vividly in my mind as one of the most memorable theatre experiences of my lifetime. Mind-blowing. 8.5/10",127 Hours
328,andrei-galgau,very nice and involving,9,21 March 2012,"Although the initial idea of the movie attracted me, I also thought ""hmm, so basically we'll see some dude stuck in a ditch for an hour and a half"", which sounded a bit boring. Well, that's when you recognize great directors because Danny Boyle manages to keep the tension up all throughout the movie which never comes out as being dull. It is also one of those rare movies that make you feel so closely related to the main carachter that you feel like doing something to change your life at the end of the movie. Personally it made me look past some grudges with some close-ones and put things into perspective, and there are certainly not many movies out there that make you want to do that! Definitely one to watch.",127 Hours
329,jones-ben42,Heartwarming True Story,10,3 February 2011,"I didn't really know anything about 127 Hours going into it, and I didn't know what to expect, aside from a brutal look into starvation, dehydration, and amputation. What I got was an amazing film laced with perseverance, bravery, courage, and sacrifice. This is easily one of my favorite films not only of the year, but of all time.James Franco is the highlight of the movie and delivers a really powerful performance. Franco is able to make a rather arrogant character really likable. Aron Ralston is the cocky, invincible, and adventurous mountain climber type. This attitude makes the character very easy to connect with, and that's one of the most important elements of a movie. You don't need to be a mountain climber or someone who enjoys canyoneering to connect with Ralston. Honestly, I think Ralston successfully embodies the average behavior of a twenty something year old person. Even that if you ever been over confident in your abilities at anything, which I'm sure everyone has in one case or another, then he's very easy to connect with. The entire incident and Ralston's struggle to survive can be a metaphor to any seemingly impossible challenge that anyone faces. Ralston's ability to realize sacrifice is the only way to survive brings a lot of depth to his character and fleshes him out as the protagonist of the film. His arc in the movie is also an amazing treat to behold. As previously stated, he does start out as a very arrogant, ""I can do anything"" kind of person, but his change is executed so well, that he's one of my favorite characters in any movie this year. You can see as the movie progresses that each day really brings a different mood of his character. He starts out extremely angry that things don't seem to go his way, he calms down, realizing that his reason would be key to helping him survive, he starts to work against the problem intelligently, he loses all hope in survival, and then gears up for one last effort at freedom. While this arc is somewhat predictable, the character is so fascinating that it doesn't really matter. Given that the movie only really has five or six characters that actually talk, there's no real need to talk about the supporting cast. This movie is centered around Aron Ralston and his struggle, physical and internal. The movie is an hour and a half of Franco's face, so it's good that the character is amazing.An arrogant climber's arm gets pinned against a canyon wall by a large rock and he must fight for survival with no one to help him. There's the story. The movie's strength in it's plot is the execution of the different ways that Ralston uses to survive and the hallucinations he experiences while starving and being dehydrated. The movie goes from Ralston successfully creating a pulley so that he can stay upright and not fall over while sleeping to him drinking his own urine when he ran out of water. When you mix together a likable character that you feel sympathy toward with successful and last resort ways to survive, you get emotion from the audience accordingly, which is once again extremely important. The viewer wants Ralston to succeed and roots for him against opposition. His hallucinations and memories only add more depth to the character and are very similar to how anyone, well at least me, would likely respond to this type of situation; you wouldn't be caught up thinking about your job or how much work you would need to catch up on, you would be concerned with the people you love and are close to. This adds more reality to the movie and makes for an enjoyable film. When all seemed lost and he was on the brink of death, one final effort is made to escape his impending doom, and he succeeds. If you don't already know the story, he must cut his own arm off. This is the most brutal part of the movie, and it's not easy to watch. But why is that? Often times when watching a violent movie and something graphic happens, it's not anything that people faint over, even if it's more graphic then the amputation in 127 Hours. Why do people faint then when watching this scene? The answer is simple and it shows the expert acting and writing of the character. Generally in those other movies, graphic things happen to minor characters, not usually the protagonist. Since Ralston is such a likable and well made character and we've been with him the whole film through the many trials he had to endure, we hate seeing him in excruciating pain. Generally when you see a friend in pain, it saddens you and you get emotionally involved in their conflict. That's the situation in 127 Hours, plain and simple. I also recommend that you watch the amputation scene for two reason: it helps you feel his pain and it makes the ending that much more satisfying to watch. The scene is brutal, but not unbearable and it's worth watching. The ending of the movie is the best payoff you could expect, just like his situation. If you can bear through the amputation, then the ending can bring you to tears. There are many great scenes in the movie, one in particular, and it's a treat to see them for yourself in this powerful movie.At the end of the film, you will feel so good about yourself. This is the kind of film you watch whenever you feel like you can't overcome a task because you know that you probably won't have to go through anymore suffering than Ralston. I could praise more things about the movie, like the amazing cinematography, background score, direction, and editing, but the central part of the movie is Ralston, and that's plenty enough reason to watch this gem of a movie.",127 Hours
330,rcwells86,An alright movie that is very slow..,4,7 January 2011,"The concept seemed interesting to me, as I liked the ""Buried"" movie alright. However this movie seemed *Much* slower than Buried, and I found myself not paying attention much after he was stuck for a bit. I can't say I remember the last movie I went to see where I was constantly checking the time on my phone and texting people. This makes a great story to read, but not one suitable for a movie in my honest opinion.I think what made it such is the constant memory flash backs he kept having through the entirety of the movie most of them being meaningless and just him losing sanity as anyone would in such a situation.",127 Hours
331,syedniloferanjumali,"It was so explicit, but that was the greatest asset of the film",10,26 May 2012,"""Based on extraordinary true story"", says the trailer. The film was true to it's words. I always wonder how difficult it might have been writing about a person trapped in a confined space, and as someone copes with it, I respect them for completing such an uneasy task. Certainly, the acting job by James Franco is amazing. The role he was charged with is not an easy one. It is definitely the film to see. The main winning factor is the idea it renders: the will to live and survive any hopeless situation; that fate can be beaten, if the will-power tries hard. Even so, almost one hour watching of the struggles of a person who tries to get released may be not for everyone. '127 Hours' is a great film with a great lead. The greatest treasure of the film is the message it conveys, which makes it a definite must see.",127 Hours

333,silviuleno,Give this man an Oscar!,10,9 January 2011,"I can't believe what i just saw. ""127 Hours"" is truly a masterpiece. Danny Boyle did it again. Period. This lesson about surviving can be teach in schools. We can learn from mistakes. For me, Aron Ralston isn't a hero. Aron is a survivor. Mankind is based on surviving in the hardest conditions. James Franco truly deserves an Oscar this year. His performance cannot be anything but perfect. It demonstrates a really courage in acting. It takes a lot of motivation and talent to go through the most difficult role, taking over the movie by himself, with a help of the extraordinary direction of Danny Boyle. In this film, James Franco is ""solo"". With the exception of some minor, but solid roles, he owns ""127 Hours"". You can feel Aron's desperation and also you can see the long string of decisions that leads him to amputate the damaged arm. The hand of Aron becomes his worst enemy. So he cut it, to set free. Danny Boyle's unique style of directing is getting more and more amazing, from start to end. ""127 Hours"" is simply great. With this role, James Franco gets in to the big league of newly actors. He did a lot of great acting jobs, but this is masterful. He can put natural feelings in his role, and the transformation is very visible. James Franco is not acting, is living the drama of Aron Ralston at a permitted level of understanding. Give this man an Oscar! He really deserve the golden statue! ""127 Hours"" can easily be the film of 2011. You did it again, Mr. Danny Boyle! As of Mr. James Franco, you can steal the Oscar and still remain innocent! Why? You deserve it!",127 Hours

335,wogsurfer,Getting outside the comfort zone,8,27 May 2017,"It's important for us as humans to step outside our comfort zone. Do something we wouldn't normally do, if we don't, we're only living life half way.I'm the first to admit that I do not practice this as often as I should, it's lead to being slightly overweight, heavily opinionated, and some may tell you, it's the reason I'm still single. Unfortunately stepping outside my comfort zone is not limited to my life, it's also in my movie watching habits.The movie I am reviewing and the review itself is outside the norm completely. Number one; I do not generally watch films like 127 Hours. Forgive me, but biopics generally do not interest me, not sure why, but I do prefer watching the fanciful, and the stuff you don't see ever in the real world. Number two; I do not own this film, the opportunity to watch the film came up due to being broadcast on satellite television, and I thought, ""Well why the hell not?"" So this review is outside the norm as it were.Enough about me, and onto the film.127 Hours tells the true story of one Aron Ralston (Franco). Adventurer, rock-climber, and canyoner, Aron is someone who definitely does not live in any comfort zone. Unfortunately one such adventure trip through Utah's Blue John canyon, Aron falls and becomes trapped with a boulder pinning his arm to the canyon wall.Despite desperate attempts at the start to free himself, Aron is most literally caught between a rock and a hard place, the term that is used for the title of Aron's book, upon which this film is based. Aron uses his guile, and survival techniques to stay alive and figure out a way to free himself.Between making video logs to his parents, winning minor victories in his attempts at freeing himself, and using Bear Grylls type methods to keep himself warm. Aron ponders his life, and the people he holds dear. This is the heart of the film, as we all have or will face moments where we have to pause, and really take the time to appreciate the life we are given, and the people who fill it. They say don't sweat the small stuff, but this film also shows that in desperate and difficult times we think about the small moments in our life.Danny Boyle is no doubt a clever film maker. In another film maker's hands this film may not have been quite as good, and probably a by the numbers kind of film. I believe Boyle is another one of those who like to live life outside his comfort level, which brings a realness to this film. Life like moments that left me thinking about how I probably would have done similar things to what Aron did.James Franco as Aron delivers a personal, internal, and remarkable performance.I am glad to say now that I have seen 127 Hours, I probably won't get outside my zone anymore than I did before, but when I do, I'll think about Aron Ralston, what he had to endure in the five days he was trapped, what he had to do to get out alive, and also not let the loss of his arm prevent him from still getting out there and living a full life.",127 Hours

The director is Danny boyle he has directed different movie (for example : Shallow Grave) and in 2009 he won the Oscar of the best director.

337,TKoote,Staggering,7,26 February 2011,"When you walk into 127 Hours, you know what you'll get; a film about a man who cuts it's arm off. I'll admit, I wasn't very happy to go see it, but I'm an Oscar-fan-boy, so I had to go before the ""big night"".It delivered in every possible way.If you live under a rock, 127 Hours is a movie about a man who is in the exact same position. An arrogant hiker falls into a cliff with a boulder landing on his right arm and gets stuck. It's not really a typical storyline for the big screen, but they've pulled it off.First of all, let me tell you about Danny Boyle. I'm not a very big fan of this Britih director. Slumdog Millionaire remains one of my most hated movies and The Beach wasn't a masterpiece either. In 127 Hours however, the man shows all of his skills. Split screen, wide shots, flashbacks; the lot. He, in combination with his cinematographers Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle, created an interesting contrast. The cliff looks extremely small and claustrophobic, while the flashback-shots look wide and open. Even when their shot inside a car.It is however, the movie of James Franco. He is no less then epic in this movie, creating an arrogant chap who becomes more and more self-conscious during his time under the boulder. His great performance tops during the scene where he acts like he is interviewing himself. In that scene, his optimistic arrogant self turns into a scared and exhausted man in such a gripping way, you know only a truly great actor could pull this off. Franco is that great an actor.And then ""the scene"". The amputations scene has had quite some attention. It had people vomiting, stroking and fainting and I have to say, some visitors leaved the room just before ""the scene"" was due to begin. I was seriously nervous about it too, having a thick stomach, but not the most blood-proof eyes. I'm glad I've seen it though. The amputation is as gruesome as you'd expect. As explicit as you may not have wanted, but as great as you'd wish. The intense and loud music, the amazing, not to say epic, editing combined with the journey you've been pulled into the hour before, makes this scene one of the best, intense and quite simply epic apotheoses ever in cinema.It's a masterpiece. It's not about an amputation, but about the journey that makes him do it.",127 Hours

Later he cut his arm himself with a Chinese multi-tool kit which have no sharp edges and survives..127 hours is directed by master story teller Danny Boyle who have directed a lot of super hits movies such as Slumdog Millionaire, 28 Days Later, 28 Weeks Later, Sunshine, Millions etc.A mountain climber Aron Alastan left his home without informing anyone where he is going on Friday morning. He even did not answered his mom's call. In the afternoon of Friday he struck his right arm with a boulder in a canyon of Utah . He tried to get help by screaming but he failed. Then he made a lever with a rope and tried to pull over the boulder but he failed again. later he tried several things in five days but everything gave him no result.He start filming himself with his camcorder. He had only 2 bottle of water one he dropped by mistake and have some foods. When all food end he cut his arm and start sucking his blood he also feeling of vomiting but he did not open his mouth for spill out because he knows this will lead him dehydration of water. He started bad dreaming in days and remembered his mistakes done in life he also had dream that whom he loves all of them are nearby him on a sofa. By that dream he got will to cut his arm himself and he got so much pain but he succeed. What a will of a man..... !!!! It's extraordinary...!!!! The most touchable scene is when he cut the his arm it's so unacceptable, hat's of the director, actor and all crew members for this scene in the film. What do you want more ????? This scene is superb I had several goose bumps while watching this scene and hearing the noise of cutting veins in his heart. The movie had best cinematography, sound effects and music,composed by A. R. Rahman, and it's too good. James Franco (Aron Alastan in movie) reached edge of acting.

340,GoldenShadow5184,The ultimate will to survive!,6,7 February 2013,"Having just finished watching 127 Hours, I am pretty pleased with the movie. Directed, co-written and produced by Danny Boyle, and starring James Franco as real-life cayoneer Aron Ralston, I thought that Danny Boyle didn't do a bad job with this film. The only other Boyle film which I have seen (besides 127 Hours) is 28 Days Later, which will definitely come off as a shock, seeing that I have still not seen Trainspotting or Slumdog Millionaire. Nonetheless, moving on with the movie...Plot-wise...it's kind of hard to actually call this a plot. I mean, the movie is basically about this guy who gets stuck a bit underground by a huge rock while canyoning. Being based off a true story, you would wonder how accurate this movie is to the source material, and from all the research I've done, this movie is actually pretty accurate! Aron Ralston himself has stated that this movie is almost completely accurate (besides the part when he's showing the two girls the hidden pool). And this is always a good thing when you are doing movies based on true stories.Getting into what I liked and didn't like about the movie, I thought that almost everything was great. One of the main issues of the film is that there just isn't much dialog being said, and this is due to the main character being trapped by himself with no one to share dialog with, and getting into what I didn't like about the film, I didn't like the way they kept on swapping from present to all the flashbacks with Ralston and his family and all of that that they did in the film to actually provide us with something. Now I know that this is based on a true story and this is actually what happened (the main character being trapped by himself), but this also makes you question whether this should just have been a documentary instead of an actual film.Overall, the film didn't really bug me that much besides the time when they kept on switching back and forth with the time line and showing all those flashbacks, but besides that, mostly everything was good. James Franco's performance in this movie was awesome (he deserved the Oscar nomination), truly showing us how Aron Ralston was a man of true courage and had endless passion to get out of the situation he was in. Cinematography was good, sound editing was good, directing was good, acting was good, and this is a film which I would highly recommend to people who are interested in a good movie based on a true story, and a good movie in general! 7/10",127 Hours

Shows the level of depth society really has.I suspect a lot of the audience who voted for this shallow piece,were young males.The type that love reservoir dogs and fight club.If you want to watch a movie that tries too hard to be cool(really annoying split screen every few minutes, strange applets whilst watching the film etc..) with an annoying tosspot then watch this by all means.",127 Hours

344,qqwwxx,8 out of 10 - you gotta be kidding! Boring and annoying.,6,13 March 2011,"This must be one of the most overrated movies of the year. I suppose it's because it's a Danny Boyle movie and he made great movies in the past such as Trainspotting, Slumdog Millionaire and 28 Days Later (which I all liked a lot) and this makes him a very cool director and hence you have to like this movie to be political correct or it might be because James Franco is hot and happening in Hollywood right now. It's the best explanation I can give because the movie itself is quite boring and apart from maybe one scene not really gripping or shocking.If you're stuck in a cave underground what would you be hearing? Exactly. Nothing at all! But this movie is filled with music and annoying sequences with lots of sound. I know it's supposed to represent his thoughts and mind but it does not work for me at all.James Franco as best actor nominee? I beg to differ. What does he do? He screams, he twists, he grimaces. He does that well enough but to get a nomination for best actor. Please! I have to say that technically everything in this movie is very well done. No problems there whatsoever and this is no surprise from a Danny Boyle movie.This movie's theme reminds me a lot about the novel ""Gerald's Game"" by Stephen King. I always thought that it'd be impossible to make it into a movie and nobody has tried. I haven't read the book by Aron Ralston but I guess it's the same thing. How do you even try to convey all his thoughts, fears, regrets and physical pains - which must be impossible to comprehend unless you're in the situation yourself - to the viewer? I can't really say but the way this movie does it is not the answer.If you want a harrowing tale about having your arm being trapped with nobody around to save you while your mind is playing tricks on you then read ""Gerald's Game"". It stays with you long after you've finished it. If you go to watch this movie you'd be rather bored and forget about it quickly.",127 Hours

Danny Boyle did an astonishing job at exemplifying the emotions Aron Ralston was suffering. When the rock lands on Ralston's arms, you feel his shock and not his pain. When the sun comes up for the first time, you FEEL how beautiful the moment is. When he drinks his first drink of water you feel his desperation, and his hopelessness when he drinks his last. Down to the operation-esque screeching pain when he rips the nerves out of his arm, Boyle puts you there with Ralston. Boyle makes you Ralston.Initially I sat down to watch the movie thinking that it would be good for what Ralston battled and overcame. I did not expect Boyle to execute it in such a phenomenal way. I asked myself, ""how is he going to do this movie in one setting?"" But he did it. He did it in such a creative, uplifting way. But Aron Ralston himself put it best.

Gave some intense scenes, and made me think about what choice I might make if put into his situation! James Franco did an excellent job, though. Before this movie, I had only seen him in comedies, but he does very well in dramatic roles, too. As of now, I've seen him play numerous different characters, but 127 Hours is the first film to make me take him seriously as an actor. So, again, great acting, just a little slow.",127 Hours

349,ianfarkas9,127 Hours is one hell of a ride,9,4 December 2010,"Plot Summary: In Danny Boyle's127 Hours, Aron Ralston (James Franco) is stuck in the penultimate ""between a rock and a hard place"" scenario: his arm, after an ill fated tumble down a slot canyon, has been trapped between a boulder and the canyon wall. With no means of communicating with the outside world and no hope of rescue (his decision to avoid discussing his travel planes with friends and family wasn't a brilliant move), Aron must find a way to escape his predicament while contemplating the events in his life that lead him to this point.Review: 127 Hours is a rare movie that grabs you by the balls in the first ten seconds and keeps squeezing until the tension is unbearable. Considering the confined corridor the film takes place in, along with the limited cast of characters, this seems like a near Herculean task. But, with Danny Boyle's wiz bang direction and James Franco giving the most entertaining performance of the year, the film moves with a grace unmatched by most modern filmmakers. The cinematography is great, everything from a ""Holy crap this is insane!"" mountain biking montage through beautiful Canyonlands park to the sheer number of different shots used to highlight Aron's predicament while trapped in the canyon. Although spending an hour in a canyon sounds like it would be boring beyond belief, Boyle keeps it interesting through flashbacks that show the experiences that led Aron to become trapped, as well as premonitions of his future should he escape his natural prison. Also punctuated throughout the film are Aron's attempts to escape, ranging from a brutish attempt to dislodge the rock with force to a gradual attempt to erode the rock by picking at it with a knife that pales in comparison to anything the Swiss army would use. These attempts, although ultimately useless, are exhilarating to watch and build nicely to a nerve shattering climax.Of course, all of this would be useless without a lead that could carry the story. Fortunately, Franco is more than up to the task. Jumping between moments of comedy and charisma to soul crushing scenes of defeat and agony, Mr. Franco never misses a beat in a performance that is worthy of all praise being bestowed upon it. Unfortunately, the film isn't without its problems. While some flashback scenes work towards creating a personality for Aron while giving perspective on his past, a large number of them revolving around a past relationship are underdeveloped and do little to deepen the character or put Aron's current situation into some form of context. There are also some poor visual effects in the form of CG ants that torment Aron and a few shots of the trapped arm that accentuate some of its faker features.Despite these minor gripes, 127 Hours is one hell of a ride. Franco's performance is a roller-coaster in and of itself, the movie stays taunt and entertaining throughout, and the jaw dropping cinematography more than makes up for the price of Admission.",127 Hours
350,jaimman,Danny Boyle did it again !!!,10,7 February 2011,"This movie has no visible weak points (for me, a ordinary viewer). First, the acting of MR. James Franco, incredible. You can feel (and see)the emotions through him, the joy, the happiness, the drama of be trapped, the transformation of a adventure man to a little tiny man trapped by the nature. The Cinematography is awesome...you'll never gonna see the desert, the canyons, the unmerciful sun, the sunset, like this before and after...great work!!!.The music, also incredible, the right melodies at the rights moments, the blood boils. The editing work is a great point of this movie, a mix of commercial spots, families flashback, nightmares, radio talk shows, sitcoms, prints a unique style of movie. remarkable. At finally, but no less important, Danny Boyle directing and gathering all the rest of elements to create and ode to life, ode to adventure, giving a lesson to how to make a great movie.

351,jack_orange_18,Danny Boyle delivers!,10,23 January 2011,"When I saw the trailer for this movie, I was so excited. The trailer alone was so well put together, and the movie doesn't disappoint. James Franco is astounding, delivering only a few lines, but showing so much emotion when he isn't even saying anything. All the different shots are awesome, They really bring you into the movie and I personally felt kind of claustrophobic while watching. That's what I was arguing with my dad about, he preferred The Social Network over this, but I didn't. I look more into angles and environment, while he looked more at the story and acting. 127 Hours is well paced also, which is surprising because most of the film Aron is stuck. The amputation scene isn't as graphic as I thought it would be, I was more disturbed when Aron breaks his own arm. There were two very powerful moments where I got chills down my spine, When he hallucinates his son on the couch, and when Aron is getting rescued. The music flows so well with the movie, it just took my breath away. And that is what this movie is, A Spectacle.",127 Hours
352,rahilsp,Perfectly made,9,7 August 2011,"When I saw this film's trailer I have to say I was not too excited about seeing it. I thought to myself how could the tale of a man being trapped by a rock be thrilling. But i was proved wrong. Danny Boyle has once again outdone himself. His creativity has turned something which could have been very average into a great piece of cinema.I loved this film from the first second to the last. The first quarter of an hour or so before Aron (James Franco)gets trapped is as well made as the rest of it. Although arguably having little relevance to the main plot this prelude perfectly shows Aron's buzzing character. The majority of this film though takes place in the canyon where Aron gets trapped. From this point the audience is thrust into a thrilling battle for survival. James Franco expertly portrays the emotions of his character who at first thinks its crazy that he has got himself into his situation but who then quickly realizes that he will have to fight for his life.We slowly see Aron's degression into a delusional state as time goes on. Boyle cleverly interjects memories from Aron's life to both take a break from the character's ordeal but mainly to give more depth to his character. We both see positive memories such as scenes with his Dad when he was a child but also negative memories such as with his former girlfriend who says he will be lonely forever. There is one great scene where he pretends to be on a morning talk show which shows his anger, idiocy and ability to make jokes in his horrific situation all at once.As his desperation increases we see him being freed from the rock in a storm however Boyle quickly makes it apparent that this was just a dream or a delusion emphasizing the reality of his situation. Then finally he has to decide whether to die or cut himself free. In a scene realistic but not too gruesome we see himself hack through his own arm in agony, finally after immense pain freeing himself (this time for real)from the rock.This film concludes by showing the real Aron Ralston who said himself that this film was so realistic it could have been a documentary. It is definitely a must see, both Franco and Boyle deserved Oscar wins.",127 Hours
353,technofunkie,127 Hours is a fantastic look at the strength of the human spirit.,9,29 November 2010,"Danny Boyle has always been an indie favourite, consistently producing  excellent films in many different genres. However, his films never  enjoyed the box-office reach they deserved. That is, until his 2008  surprise blockbuster Slumdog Millionaire broke all expectations. It was  a film that would then allow Danny Boyle to create whatever film  project he wanted, with presumably whatever budget he needed.   This is a dream situation for any director, but instead of taking the  opportunity to direct a massive budget film, he writes and directs, 127  Hours. The film, which tells the incredible true story of Aron Ralston,  could be handled in incredibly different ways. Luckily, Boyle's film  about a man having to cut off his own arm doesn't leave you feeling  depressed, but rather it is energetic and life-affirming. The film  doesn't tone down any of the difficult aspects, in fact it throws them  right in your face. However, what makes this film so fantastic, is that  Boyle's style matches Ralston's view on life and explanation for  surviving the awful ordeal.   The film begins at a furiously kinetic pace, one you would be hard  pressed to find in an action film. It is a jolt to the senses and it  sets the perfect mood for the film. It is not making light of a  terrible situation but rather putting you in the mind set that Aron  Ralston was in before the accident occurred. What makes this  directorial decision so important is the fact that without  understanding the kind of person he was, we couldn't understand how he  survived the awful ordeal he was in.  This is what makes Boyle perfect for the material, where another  director would most likely go very minimalist, Boyle goes all out in  terms of style, without ever losing the emotional connection. Boyle's  stylistic choices heighten emotional integrity where as other  directors' use of style is often just visual stimulation.   As important Boyle's direction was to making the film great, if it were  not for James Franco's performance as Aron, the film would have failed.  Franco gives one of the strongest performances of his career, if not  his best. His performance could very easily have become showy and  overly dramatic, yet Franco was smart enough to restrain himself until  the moment called for dramatics.   It would be a real shame to forget the unsung heroes of this film, the  two directors of photography; Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle.  As the film features, for the most part, one man on screen for the  duration, Boyle decided to make the visuals into their own characters.  To do this, he employed two fantastic directors of photography to make  the visuals competing characters. As the film progressed, remembering  the incredibly impressive shots became harder and harder, to a point  where I lost count. The film features some of the most memorable shots  of Boyle's career, many of which leave you wondering how they possibly  accomplished them.  Danny Boyle has made a career of films about men who are pushed to  their absolute limits, yet the films always leave you feeling better  than when you arrived. He does not muddy his films with sentimentality  or out of place scenes to make the audience feel better, but his films  still leave you feeling an energy for life. It is his talent of finding  the strength within people and his natural ability to present it to us  that makes his films so powerful. 127 Hours is one of the rare films  that leaves an audience in their seats during the credits, and for  many, even after the credits are done their scroll.",127 Hours
354,EvelynFilmFan,Great view on one man's adventure and his survival,7,3 February 2016,"127 Hours shows how you should not go on an adventure. When you decide to go on a trip alone and to a place where you don't have any phone range, let someone know where you're going and how long you'll be gone. It can help you save your life. When you're lost or in this case, trapped in a canyon.127 Hours tells the true story of a young man who got trapped under a boulder in the remote and deserted canyon somewhere near Moab in Utah. Aron Ralston – extremely well portrayed by James Franco – is a professional mountain climber and adventurer. He goes almost every weekend on a solo trip without letting anyone know where he goes. Along with his equipment Aron's on his way to a trip that will change his perspective completely.In the beginning everything is good. He takes preparations for his trip and when he finally arrives at his destination it looks pretty amazing! The film shows us how wonderful that place is – Moab, Utah – and gives a perfect view of a hidden pool! To me it also looks kind of dangerous, since the place looks the same which makes it easy to get lost. But for Aron that's no problem, it looks like he has been there more than once. But like I said, everything looks fine. The weather is amazing, Aron is in a very good mood and we got to see a very beautiful landscape. Along the way he meets two girls – Kristi (Kate Mara) and Megan (Amber Tamblyn) – who are a bit lost in their quest to find a hidden pool. As the gentleman he is, Aron guides them to it. After one-third of the film, it goes terribly wrong for Aron. This is also the part where James Franco shows his amazing talents.Aron slips into a deep canyon and his arm got stuck under a builder. He stays surprisingly very calm, I would totally freak out if I got stuck like that and didn't knew what do to do! Lucky for him he got some ideas, but without water great ideas also dry up.. James Franco did an amazing job in showing different emotions towards the situation. I mentioned before in an other review that I think Franco is better in his more dramatic roles. I like him better anyway. Aron was calm but also terrified and at some points he was really losing his mind. Can you imagine, being stuck for 127 hours and without water and sunlight? Aron's little 'show' was really funny and just like the multiple flashbacks it also shows that he knows he has to change. There's one moment when his mind is so far away that you might think he made it!I thought the ending of the film was very beautiful and emotional. I also liked what the filmmakers did at the end and beginning: the contrast of big events with a lot of people versus the lonesomeness of one man near the Moab canyon. I also like the camera work! How Franco recorded himself in the canyon but also while on his back. The scenes where he made a 'selfie' really made me laugh. I mean this film was made in 2010 but the story is from 2003. I've said it before: A 'selfie' is nothing new!These kind of films always makes me wonder how I would act and if I had a change of survival? I hope I'll never have to find that out. And I think the most important lesson you can take from this film, is that you always must tell someone where you're going. But also to enjoy and never give up!!",127 Hours

Why is a movie with such an amazing acting gets such low ratings, and yet a movie with minimal acting and cartoon CGIs gets higher rating than this movie? What happened to the traditions of appreciating a movie? Is it gone? First of all, I love the way James Franco acts in this. He has the ability to connect with the audience. With restricted movements, all James Franco can make this movie a huge success is by his emotions, in which he did it flawlessly.Solid 9, could have given a 10 but still thinks this movie can do better.

356,remakesramistake,Not Boyle's best movie but sure one of Franc's best performances.,7,30 January 2018,"When James Franco is not busy doing spectacular comedies with his buddy Seth Rogen he chooses to deal with interesting projects. And this movie is one of them. 127 hours is a story of survival and the desire to live. But it's also a movie based on real events and as we know this is a lot of times really risky to adapt to the big screen. Fortunately the director of the movie is long time favorite Danny Boyle. Trainspotting's talented is aware of the risks and he makes all the right moves making the film enjoyable. He makes the movie short and straight to the point with the right amount of thrills and a little bit of light hearted comedy in the start. But the most important aspect of the movie it's the one man performance from the main star. James Franco for me is a mediocre actor. But he is a smart guy. He chooses his steps really carefully and most of the times the results are spot on. This happens also in ""127 hours"". He manages to lift the whole movie in his shoulders and captivates you with his entire presence for 90 minutes. I'm not really font of biopic movies myself but I have to say this film made me have a really good time. It has its thrills and is a fine tribute to human resolve. It's not of course Danny Boyle's best movie but is a nice movie overall and it will make you stay in your seat for it's entire time.",127 Hours

Initially I was apprehensive about seeing it and had put it off for weeks.A movie like this could have easily been a disaster had it not been created so perfectly. So happy I did not miss it -- on the big screen.(The following lines are unrelated -- just killing space to pass the 10 line minimum. Would IMDb please remove the 10 line requirement?

360,DirkesDiggler,"Intense, harrowing, and amazing",10,28 October 2010,"This movie is the reason I don't go camping, hiking, or engage in any outdoor activity other than golf. I don't care how bad I play, I have never once been in the position to even consider cutting my own arm off to get back to the clubhouse.That being said This is an incredibly intense, rough, and powerful film that is by no means easy to watch, but it is quite good.If you don't knew the story, Aron Ralston, an avid outdoors-man, mountaineer, hiker, biker, all of that, goes off for a weekend ride and exploration without telling anyone where he's going and had the worst possible thing happen to him. No, he wasn't killed or sodomized by hill folk, a rock in a cave he was climbing gave way, pinning his arm to the wall of the cave. In the middle of nowhere, out of view, and running low on supplies his case seemed hopeless until he made the realization that ""I have a great tourniquet."" Oh, and it's a true story.This film focuses on the 127 hours from when he falls to the moment he makes a decision that most people couldn't even consider making. What you have here is a person, faced with a dire situation, no food, little water, unable to even turn around, having to jerry rig a climbing harness just to sleep, seeing his life for what it is, the good and the bad. This film presents a man laid bare and shows what you learn about yourself and life when it appears you will lose it.The film itself is extremely well made. Danny Boyle pulls out as many stops as one can when dealing with a scenario that renders the camera immobile for a majority of the proceedings. Visually, he seems to be locked into his ""Slumdog Millionaire"" film grammar. It has that look and feel, the rich colors, the slightly slowed action, rewound scenes, flashbacks to small details we missed the first time, but the thematic elements keep it from feeling like a retread. He mixes a very stylized editing and grandiose establishing shots that show the vastness of the landscape with shaky hand held tracking shots that make you feel personally involved.What I found most impressive was his use of sound. Not only to convey the isolation, but, more impressively, to communicate the intense pain of a self preformed amputation. The use of the camcorder, not only as source for on screen footage but as a second character, is incredibly affecting, and allows James Franco (in the performance of his career) to show the emotional swings from a forced joy to borderline insanity, and finally into the determination to live that would drive a man to such action.This is not an easy film to watch, but it is not the people fainting at screenings histrionic affair that some are making it out to be. What it is is a very honest and real portrayal of what happens when you are confronted with losing everything.Read more from me at www.thefilmthugs.com",127 Hours

Truly this was a good movie but tell you the fact i had great expectations with this one , off course because of the masterpiece ''slumdog millionaire'' .But this movie turns out to be just an ''okey '' movie. The only thing that carry movie was the fact that this is a real life story, which gets your mind to think about the situation and what you would have done there and keep on watching it.It is not that interesting what it claims, I prefer '' I shouldn't be alive'' by the Discovery channel , The best part of it was the talk show like thingy in the middle of despair and who forgets the amazing word ''ooops''. The only thing that i was soo much disappointed with Danny Boyle was he never let us settle with the emotions of loss, helplessness ,sorrow, despair ....which was the main theme of the movie to engage the audiences. The ending was good but could have been better if wasn't a true story. OVERALL A GOOD MOVIE ..........WORTH A WATCH(only because of the acting of James Franco ) !!!!",127 Hours
362,NolanFincherBoyle,127 Hours traps raw human emotion and powerful storytelling all into one,10,7 March 2011,"Danny Boyle's new feature film, straight after winning the Best Director's Oscar for Slumdog Millionaire, is 127 Hours. Hours depicts the true story of 28 year old Aaron Ralston, played by now Oscar nominated actor James Franco, who for 127 antagonizing and haunting hours in a mountain crevice in Utah, encounters the survival with one arm impractical to use and with both little food or water after a sudden accident leaving him vulnerable and alone. Hours is also, for me, one of the best movies of last year due to a powerful duo of great acting and directing. Much acclaim has gone into Hours since its initial release back in November. First off, I agree with critics in saying that actor James Franco (Spiderman 1-3, Pineapple Express) was fantastic as Ralston, showing a more human side to his character as a person who feels alone to be out in the world around him. He regularly avoids his family, has little to no friends outside classmates from school, and was always considered a loner to everyone he encountered. He pulls this off perfectly in a few crucial scenes in the movie. The decomposition of Ralston's character is unmatched to any performance that I've seen all year, which is why I'm personally rooting for Franco to win the Oscar.British director Danny Boyle(Slumdog Millionaire, 28 Days Later) is the driving force for 127 Hours to not only be critically acclaimed (garnering 6 Oscar nominations for the upcoming Oscars in February), but to be both spiritually and emotionally driven with its 94 minute runtime. His fluid direction filled with beautiful cinematography of the landscapes of the Utah desert, stylized editing skills that show off how visionary Boyle is in storytelling (through flashbacks of Ralston's own life and vision of things to come in his changed life), and with his great collaboration with composer A.R Rahman (up for a Oscar nomination himself), giving Hours a great depth to be seen multiple times outside one viewing. Hours shows a side to a human character that can overcome the even most impossible scenario in a life or death situation, shows why I loved 127 Hours so much. The limited use of live outside shots to help establish an atmosphere so cluster phobic and grisly that you feel that, with Aaron, we too have an boulder imprinted into our own arm. We may not see it or feel the same way Ralston/Franco felt in both real life and in the making of the film, but the rock holding us down can also reflect struggles in our own lives. Even after losing the arm he would eventually cut off himself in the process of being stuck, Ralston (like ourselves) will also change the way we see things and tend to appreciate the things around us more than we ever did. I also must add that with also being Oscar nominated for the first time, James Franco is also hosting the 83rd Academy Awards with co-host Anne Hathaway (recently named the future Cat-women for The Dark Knight Rises). I really hope the best for him, as he always seemed to be an actor I regularly disliked watching a movie where he was in it. Here, it completely does a 180 with having some of the most heartbreaking moments captured on film from 2010 alone. His composure, his positivity, and his endurance were the reasons why Ralston was able to get out of the crevice in the first place. And if Franco does turn out the victory, he would be the first ever host of the Oscars to win an award that same night as a nominee in a category. My best of wishes to Franco (and to Boyle), as you two gentlemen, performed phenomenally in Hours. The final minutes of 127 Hours may be hard to watch for some viewers (myself included), as it's a test of pure motivation and mind-set of going through the act of survival. We are prepared to go through the fate Ralston had contemplated with his character the entire film from the first minute he landed in the situation at hand. Ralston is as relatable in his own situation as this ""average-Joe"" that we notably root for, even when he shows shades of cracking at any moment. It's in this trust we give to both Franco and Boyle in delivering us an unforgettable film for us to view and talk about in years to come. Even after all is said and done (and a lot is done), Hours lingers in our minds like the rock that still lingers with Ralston's being today: horrible in the way of taking something away, but relieving in how it gave so much good back.",127 Hours

I loved this movie from the first second to the last second everything about this movie is brilliant.First off, this movie does not make you wait. It has a few minutes of his life before the accident then it jumps straight into the boulder landing on his arm and pinning him in the canyon. James Franco completely captures the emotions (I imagine) Aron Ralston was going through. This movie was so captivating that I couldn't even eat the popcorn because I was so caught up in the movie. I think the camera-work is AMAZING (especially the panning shot of the canyon). James Franco even made me feel the emotions he was going through and even made me cry with joy when he cried with joy after cutting his arm off and escaping the canyon! This movie is amazing! I HIGHLY recommend this to everyone! If I could I wouldn't give it 10/10 i'd give it 999,999,999.99/10! GO SEE THIS MOVIE! If you have the chance pick up the book of this movie/true story by the real Aron Ralston it's called 'Between A Rock And A Hard Place' (WARNING: This movie contains a very graphic amputation scene by a very small pocket knife) People have fainted, walked out & vomited from that one scene.OVERALL: Great F***ing Movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",127 Hours
365,sonny-corleone,127 hours gripping or boring?,9,31 January 2011,"Hello guys127 hours Gripping or boring?Just finished watching the critically acclaimed 127 hours by Danny Boyle , after going in with one advert shooting through my head 'amazing , power , magnificent etc etc.' I was ready to be let down by yet another award movie that only the snobs like i.e. (Oscar award panel) I was surprised that this film was not all that appeared it was not a desperate struggle to cut his arm off but a psychological battle with himself up to that point of why he always isolates himself from affection and is this rock just his come upence really. The trailer did mislead really as it made it look like similar movie buried. The difference was the actor no offence to Ryan Reynolds who is amazing James Franco was spot on with his portrayal.The Story as everyone knows is of Hiker  going out into the desert and cliff by himself and getting trapped by a rock and left for 127 hours to survive until the inevitable choice do I cut my arm off to get free.The film made on a she string budget by genius Danny Boyle (28 days later) made this film not to shock which it did, people passing out in cinema but to make people think what they would, wait an die of starvation or cut your arm off and wait for someone to come 5 seconds later and it to be for nothing? That's the overriding question that has to be asked really.James Franco who I have seen little of in a serious acting role i.e. Spiderman which I couldn't stand and the wonderfully underrated pineapple express which he played against character really. But within this you could see he had worked on trying to get the right balance between desperation and over acting and he did with a twist of insanity when has talking to himself very funny.The awards season always does bring out these sort of movies 'art house' flicks that love to bore people into the ground and then at the end say bravo mentioning no names 'hurt locker' but this was made for a wider public to see it was made to be marketed as a film you just had to see. This film is not for the easily amused or the easily distracted it is for the ones who as my brother would say live within each movie they watch and feel what the character feels.This Film does have Barlington's seal of recommendation!",127 Hours

At first I had my doubts about whether this film would be worth the hype and after reading the reviews I was intrigued about how it would actually work. These doubts however, were completely shrugged off after a gripping and entertaining watch of a film I can only describe as an emotional roller-coaster. I got so involved with this film. Boyle really does have a nack of moving his audience to connecting with characters and through out this film he does just that. Although James Franco's character appears to be a tough and edgey character, you begin to really feel for him and almost emphasise the pain he is going through. So when the sh** hits the fan and he is led no other option but to take his own arm, you understand his logic of survival and courage which distracts you from the utter gore of such an horrific scene.

367,dementedstud,A good movie,8,16 January 2011,"The movie got a lot of things right. James Franco played the part excellently, the soundtrack was good and adequate and the writing was good enough to keep the audiences glued to their seat.I wouldn't go far to say that this movie is a trend-setter in any genre but definitely a good watch. The humor was unique and kept the audience wary. Considering the fact that this was a real life story and the script was borrowed from a book, it simply boiled down to the execution and acting and both were spot on.Franco comes across as this sweet loving guy that the viewer wants to win this challenge he is facing and come out alive. That simple premise is enough to make a hero out of him as he eventually makes it. Soundtrack from Rahman was at times distracting but it seems like there was a deliberate attempt at avoiding the stereotypical music that goes into such films, which is edgy and eerie. But instead, the music here is grand and elevates all emotions coming from the viewer.In the end it is a film about the human spirit and what really drives, motivates and inspires us. If you can take that from the film then Danny Boyle has done his job well. 127 hours.",127 Hours

James Franco nailed it. I believed the character and all his suffering. And talk about SUFFERING!! I was feeling thirsty just watching this!
There's a part at the end when he goes for it, and he has to cut a tendon, and the shreaking noise made the hairs on my neck stand up.

369,bloomjc,"""127 Hours"" s story of courage and determination",10,22 December 2010,"127 HOURS (2010): 4 stars out of 4. Starring James Franco and Amber Tamblyn. Screenplay by Danny Boyle and Simon Beaufoy. Directed by Danny Boyle. Rated R.""127 Hours"" is an extraordinary motion picture, a cinematic profile of courage, determination and the will to live no matter what the cost.What is most amazing is that it is based on a true story. In 2003, mountain climber Aron Ralston goes canyoneering alone outside of Moab, Utah.An accident wedges part of his arm under a boulder and he is unable to free himself until he resorts to very desperate measures.As portrayed by James Franco, Ralston is somewhat of a hot dog — a loner and a somewhat irresponsible. He takes off for the wilderness without letting anyone know where he plans to climb. He also forgets to take his cell phone.But he is a happy camper who enjoys trekking through the various crevices and byways of the canyons on his own,That solitude also is his downfall for when he has his accident, he has nowhere to turn nor any means of communicating his predicament to anyone.Franco gives a superb performance of a young man who, though impulsive, also is organized. With the exception of his cell phone, he packs all the gear he needs for what he believes will be a one-day excursion.Director Danny Boyle opens the film with a montage of crowds and crowds of people hustling and bustling through their day.He presents a frenetic, always on the go world. It is one Ralston is part of, but will soon leave for the comfort and stillness of the canyons.One of Doyle's most impressive images is in showing how alone Ralston is after he becomes trapped. The vast emptiness around him swallows up his screams for help. T(spoiler alert) The sequence where Ralston performs the necessary surgery to extricate himself is graphic and may make some queasy. It also is shot in a restrained manner. Doyle does not exploit the moment for shock value — that is not his intention.What he does convey though, is the necessity and sacrifice one must make for survival.""127 Hours"" is a tour-de-force for Franco and Doyle. Both deserve Academy Award nominations in their respective categories, as does the picture in general.It is one of the best films of the year, a gritty and triumphant inspirational story of one man's indomitable will to live despite the slimmest of odds.Bloom is the movie critic and Blu-ray/DVD reviewer for the Journal & Courier.

370,leminhha93,Powerful and beautiful,9,6 February 2012,"Director Danny Boyle made a simple and straightforward premise - a mountain climber trapped in a narrow passage trying to make it out alive - into a masterpiece of cinematic work that is 127 Hours. The film transports the audience into the character's world and makes us feel immensely for him. You could feel his physical and emotional pain, his desperation, his hallucination - the entire experience of 127 Hours was created in such a way the audience felt directly in the character's shoes. The infamous climax scene got me recoiled and winced with pain - such reaction no gore horror or violent action film has ever elicited from me.Needless to say, besides Danny Boyle's brilliant camera-work, it was James Franco's intense and terrific acting that made 127 Hours the masterful work it is. One drawback I felt though was of the film's length - perhaps the experience could have been more powerful had the film run for 120 minutes.127 Hours, a thought-provoking, harrowing, inspiring, beautiful and brilliant film, will leave the audience in breathless awe and high in spirits. 9/10.",127 Hours

372,khsu,...And 95 Minutes Too Long,1,18 November 2010,"First, let's not talk about the cop-out 'reminiscing/fantasy' sequences that practically intercut every other scene in this man-gets-into-some-deep-subterranean-trouble, now a veritable subgenre in the supposed one-man-body-horror category--come on, if you want to do claustrophobic, then DO claustrophobic (cf Hitchcock, Polanski, Lynch)--because, I suspect, Boyle himself knows there isn't much clothing on the proverbial emperor here: Nothing to film here, folks. And nothing to see.It's certainly not unexpected, albeit still somewhat bemusing, to see several audience members walk out of the theater, scratching their heads while mumbling to each other: 'What was the point of THAT?' Yes, what WAS the point? Let's look at it, shall we? He got what he deserved, right? Either you read that, as he said himself (perhaps as the hallucinations really began setting in), as 'everything in his life has led him to this point,' recognition of self in world, lesson learned via trauma etc, etc...or, maybe even with a tad of Schadenfreude, we can all claim with the Universe that the a##hole was put in his place...Doesn't matter. You'd be wrong.And this where the film manages actually to get somewhat interesting, and mildly subversive. (And props to Dan if this were intended, but I doubt it.) THE REAL FILM, a la Hamlet, in the film is the flashback sequences (whose frequency of occurrence here is no accident). In particular, those ones involving his childhood and adolescence. I love how there was just a nuanced, near-missed undertone of paternal resentment in the sequences involving his father, who sets up his nerdy, weakling son (the glasses/contacts--a Kleinian partial object if there ever was one) to be an inevitable failure, a disappointment (the rock therefore is really just the paternal superego). Maternal absence? Check. (The link to China and the global economy via the pocketknife-gift couldn't have been more perfect and made more explicit here--but more on that in a bit.) The Trauma in the film is not the arm caught in the rock, which is simply one more emanation from the Real Traumatic Core, obliquely referred to in the reminiscing sequences about his *SISTER*. If you watch carefully (the piano-playing scenes, and how later he said he missed her wedding--both first-person, camcorded), there is just a subtle hint of incest between him and the sister, and between the father and the sister. The Real Trauma here is the jealousy between him and his father, and the fact that his father CASTRATED him as a result--which is simply repeated and reenacted here by the explicit 'dismemberment' scene. (By the way, are we supposed to hear the American Online dial-up tone every time we cut into bone? I've never seen so many blatantly serial product placements in one film in my life--but more on 'the global economy' later.) Never confuse message with code. Films often tell us one thing, but show us another. When he finally dismembers himself and breaks free (physically speaking), what's the first thing he does? Take a picture. Ah, the invincibility of human beings on Earth, the superior indomitability of the human spirit (echoing the song in the beginning), literally reified for the masses to watch here--I kid not, the audience literally cheered, at that exact moment. What's all that hullabaloo about understanding one's place in the world? Respect for nature, the universe...? You can forget it now; Americans (and the colonialist Brits) like to WIN. And whom does he run into first in his 'escape?' The prototypical middle-class nuclear family--Mommy (Third World, 'untapped' resources, Earth, material), sonny (petit bourgeois), and Daddy (the State): the Oedipal structure of the flow of capital is re-affirmed once again. (Does the helicopter remind anybody a little too much of the last scene in Lord of the Flies?) It's truly gratifying to be able to re-insert oneself into the order of consumption-meaning-social network, isn't it? (The truth is, our protagonist has never left it.) Where everything makes sense again--and the audience cheered.On the surface, the films says: Global Capitalism Bad. In reality, everything it shows demonstrates its unconscious flipside--its absolute and unwavering, total support of it (the split-screen diptych at the end of the cave paintings and the global consuming 'masses' today, couldn't show this more clearly), that it's nothing if not the natural order of things. God=Capital. C'est la vie.Another film of late about a man being trapped underground is similar: What it says--Terrorism Bad. What it shows--terrorists are people too (the main character actually says something to this effect), and the American bureaucracy (shown to be maddeningly ineffective, indifferent, and eerily Kafkaesque) actually DESERVES terrorism??? In this sense, this particular film is in fact quite radical (while appearing conservative in nature), whereas 127 Hours is extremely conservative (while being liberal in appearance).Films like these, so empty and devoid of any content, really act as the perfect vessel for a bunch of calcified, subterranean ideologies.Watch them.

373,tuppen2010,Flashy and a little one-dimensional,5,29 October 2010,"This film is fine. It's well made and well acted. You know the plot before you go in: man falls down hole; man's arm gets trapped; man hacks off his arm. That, unfortunately, is it. Boyle is great at developing tension, but despite the film's relatively short running time, it drags. The problem is there's nowhere for either character or narrative to go. Yes, it's amazing (and hideous to watch) that Aron Ralston chops off his own arm - and you marvel at his grim determination - but it doesn't make him an interesting or engaging character. The film is sustained by the flashy energy of the cinematography (and flights of poorly realised fantasy), to take us out of Ralston's stony prison, and it looks great. But I quickly reached a point where I wanted to shout ""enough already!"" Too many gimmicks, too much flash and not enough substance. This is a film for unsophisticated boys.",127 Hours

Aron Ralston is a hero to many and I'm sure he likes this film. And James Franco does an amazing job as Aron. The music composed by A.R. Rahman is amazing and emotional and Danny Boyle, a tremendous director, did a fantastic job. No wonder this film got nominated for 6 Academy Awards.

379,jimharvey87,Going it alone,6,10 February 2011,"Claustrophobic film is on the rise. Rodrigo Cortes's Iraq film Buried (2010) was released to surprising acclaim last year. A trailer for Sanctum (2010), the forthcoming James Cameron-produced underwater cave-exploration adventure, precedes 127 Hours: Danny Boyle's first feature since Slumdog Millionaire (2008). The same motif of entrapment stemming from lone attempts at glory fills much of Boyle's work. The results are shown in Shallow Grave (1994), Salim's demise in Slumdog, and Richard's attempts to outfox Sal in The Beach (2000). In some ways, the surreal realities of Trainspotting (1996) and 28 Days Later... (2002) turn this on its head, with the character needing to escape, towards a civilised community.However, it isn't the setting so much that's the appeal with this theme of being trapped in small spaces, but more the character's coping with the event. Aron Ralston (James Franco) is an adventurer. Fearless, enthusiastic and resourceful, it seems that he doesn't need anyone – it's this that becomes the premise for what's to come. How far does being a loner, in spite of your own resourcefulness, really get you? It's difficult not to draw reference to the political climate. A glimpse of Ralston's boss's t-shirt tells us ""They can't lay us off if they can't find us"". Boyle himself has maintained lifelong Labour sympathies, which can account for the focus on community (or the lack of it) that drives the film. In a life or death situation, Ralston comes to realise that resourcefulness and will might prevail, but that individualism landed him there. 'Checking in' now and then might have avoided the whole fiasco.This is typical Boyle fare from the outset, exhibiting an MTV-style montage of soda, beer, and fast-food. It works as a kind of visual ""Choose life..."" The gore (for which a fair amount of the audience are here primarily to see) is near-meticulous in it's attempts to qualify this as surgery: the camera constantly returning the severing of the nerve. These fast paced cuts of close-up, which include a number of unnecessary microscopic scenes of water, perspiration, urine leaving their points of origin, recall to some extent moments of terror in 28 Days Later. It's visceral soundtrack (scored by A.R. Rahman of Slumdog) and (akin to Cillian Murphy's desperate hero) Franco's intensity supports this. Not short of new, more technically demanding ways to visually show the vastness of middle-American desert, Boyle's never been one for allowing his audience time to contemplate - this is what distinguishes Sean Penn's understandably compared, but superior, Into the Wild (2007).What Slumdog offered the viewer in terms of a rarely transmitted, transcultural showpiece, was marred slightly with cliché. High-octane throughout, 127 Hours amalgamation of contemporary media phenomenons, while subtle in its assessment of the Western socio-political landscape, doesn't feel quite so important. Franco will quite rightly earn praise to add to his growing repertoire for his portrayal of the all-American wanderer. Boyle on the other hand - following a church floor covered with the walking-dead, the brutal blinding of a slum child, and now a severed limb left somewhere in the Utah desert – continues to struggle to reach the affect of Trainspotting.",127 Hours

For a true story that doesn't seem like a good fit for the big screen Danny Boyle did an amazing job taking on something like this. I would recommend this movie to anyone, its definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.",127 Hours
381,ryangozlan,"Gripping, Intense, Emotional, & Amazing",9,13 October 2010,"Gripping, intense, and emotional would probably be the three best adjectives to describe Danny Boyle's 127 Hours. I'll admit that when I first heard the news that someone had a literal panic attack during the screening at Telluride, I was super excited to see it, as it could only have meant that the film was truly genuine and amazing. My assumptions were correct, as Danny Boyle and Simon Beaufoy (who also wrote the Slumdog Millionaire script with the director) put together another great film, this time with the challenge of one actor on screen for the entire movie. For those of you unfamiliar with the movie, 127 Hours tells the story of real life climber Aron Ralston (Franco) and his struggle to survive after his arm gets trapped under a boulder while mountaineering near Moab, Utah. Going into a film like this, one would wonder how a movie with one actor and essentially one filming location could entertain an audience for about 90 minutes. Well, Danny Boyle did an excellent job of keeping people glued to the screen without taking away from the film and boring audience members. With his funky style of directing, amazing camera shots, as well as his ability to bring so much information and life into a one man show, Boyle tackled this daunting task beautifully. The directors uses of Ralston's fantasies, hallucinations, comedic relief, and the character's will to live all helped keep audience members interested, and wondering how and when this man would survive such an catastrophe. Now to the leading man of the film, James Franco. I will admit, before this film I had never seen Franco give an awe-inspiring performance in any film really, but 127 Hours was his calling card. People should take notice, because this guy can really hold his own both on screen and off. Franco gave a fantastic performance in this one, and really made the character of Aron Ralston believable to the audience (which is what good actors do). He played the role seriously, but also gave the audience the much needed comedic relief, evening out the intensity of the film with a little bit of good humor. This isn't an easy role to portray for any actor, and it seemed as though Franco tackled it with ease, playing a disgruntled and challenging Ralston, and the different moods and emotions he feels while being trapped. I would be insane not to give credit to both Simon Beaufoy and Danny Boyle for writing another excellent screenplay. Unlike their previous film, Slumdog Millionaire, which was an excellent screenplay, this one stands out more simply because of the limitations they had when writing it. Essentially, it was a dialogue prepared for one man to speak to himself for about 80 minutes, mostly through his hand-held video camera.This movie is getting the granny apple A it deserves; the combination of great directing, writing, and an amazing performance by James Franco, truly make this film a remarkable one. The ability to overcome challenges and limitations, like Boyle did in this film, is what I believe separates the great directors from the good ones. Furthermore, the pace, intensity, suspense, and even Boyle's added humor, all add to the amalgamation of this films success. The films funkiness, brilliance, and realism faze out the idea that there is only one actor on screen sitting in the same location for almost the entirety of the film. The real life Aron Ralston summed the film up perfectly during the emotional Q&A session at the end of the film saying ""Humans have no idea of their true potential or what the are capable of, given the situation they're in."" 127 Hours comes out on November 5, 2010, and unless you get queasy very easily, it is definitely a must-see.",127 Hours

""If i rise"" at the end by AR Rahman and Dido is a class act. Too bad it lost out on the Oscars. But surely this is one of the best ever adaptation of a real life story.

I had a very short list of movies for this board but I can safely say I can add one more to that list and it's called ""127 Hours."" This movie is a spectacular collaboration of emotional images, mental break downs, and the power of the human will to live. This movie grabs your attention right from the beginning and moves your butt right to the edge of the seat. You will be stuck there staring at the screen until the very end and then and only then you will finally sit back in relief. I wouldn't normally do a spoiler review but in his case I am because it is a true story and through out the movie you know the ending. This is a sign of a create film because you know the ending but yet you can't look away from the screen where in most cases, when you now the end of a movie it becomes uninteresting. This movie is more than just watching a man try to make it out of what seems to be an impossible situation to survive. James Franco did an absolutely amazing job at playing the role of Aron Ralston and really showing what went through his mind during the 127 hours he was trapped. When Aron started to hallucinate he saw his family, friends, and a love he once had. He would flashback to all the great times he had with all of them and he would break down every time a little more inside yet give him the strength to stay alive. He had even given up and it seemed he was done. He video taped himself during a psycho break down, doing a talk show with himself has he played all the characters. He began to talk about how stupid he was to not tell anyone where he was going. He talked about how even his friend Chris wouldn't know he was gone till the weekend. Even if Chris reported him missing police can't take action for 24 hours and at that point he would be dead for sure. After he was finished with his break down video he snapped back to reality. He started thanking his parents for everything they had done for him and that he wishes that he had responded to every call that she gave him throughout his life. You can see in his face when he was taping that he knew he was going to die and the emotion was just pour out of his body. He made you feel that emotion in yourself as you watched the film and all you can do is just hope he makes it out alive.Finally at the end of the movie, after now surviving on his own urination, he see's what I believe is his nephew on the other side of the rock on a couch in the sand. He see's himself playing with him and picking him up playing around and having fun. He realizes there is no chance of getting out of here in any reasonable way, so he kneels down and puts pressure on his arm and snap! He breaks his arm and continues to break it even more. He pulls out his dull knife and begins to cut his arm where he had broken the bone. He is soon stopped by a nerve that seems to painful to cut. This scene itself makes every muscle in your body tense up for 20 seconds and you won't be able to relax. When he finally cuts that cord your entire body twitches in relief. He cuts the rest of his arm off and he escapes from what seemed to be certain death. When he falls backwards and looks at the rock that has trapped and stopped his life for 5 days, you are looking at a man that came back from the dead. When you see this part of the film you watch with ""ahhhh"" and you almost don't know how to feel but you almost want to cry because he made it out after everything he went through.This movie is one of the greatest films I have ever seen and I give it a solid 9/10. If you haven't had the pleasure of seeing this movie you need to go out, buy a movie ticket, and see this movie as soon as you can.",127 Hours

387,laurenlchilcott,intense true story movie of 2010,7,2 July 2013,"made about the true story of Aron Ralston, a mountain climber who goes canyoneering at a deserted canyon in Utah, as he is climbing he slips down a gap and gets his hand trapped under a boulder. stuck with no one around and only a days worth of water he desperately try's everything he can to get free. as the days go on his water getting low, food running out he gets weaker and weaker his mind going crazy hallucinating and having flashbacks as he starts to go over all the things he done wrong in his life wishing he did things differently and appreciated the people around him. knowing he was going to leave his loved ones behind he knows there is only one thing to do... cut off his arm.James Franco does an amazing in this as he is pretty much the only actor in this and the majority of the movie is shot standing in the small gap in the canyon, he shows all the emotions perfectly and really makes the viewer feel what he must be going through I think this was helped by the real Aron Ralston working close with Danny Boyle in the making of the movie so they could get as much of the true story as possible but while still giving it the Hollywood movie feel.after seeing this movie it makes it hard to believe that this actually happened to someone especially during the amputation of the arm scene which is pretty uncomfortable viewing and is really quite hard to watch and It takes a lot for me to feel like that but even more so as he has to do it with a blunt pen knife and it was shot so well and make really graphic and gory so you cant possibly imagine what Aron must of gone through.in all its a gripping, well made, brilliantly acted, intense and more importantly very moving film defiantly one of the best of 2010 and a great watch knowing it didn't come from a Hollywood directors imagination but was a persons terrifying life changing experience.",127 Hours

390,Jiminy_critic,"I don't usually write reviews, but felt I needed to after watching this masterpiece.",10,10 January 2011,"Where do I begin? I went to the cinema with medium expectations of this film. I am a fan of Danny Boyle movies, from Shallow Grave through to 21 Days Later. I liked (not loved) Slumdog Millionaire, but wasn't on the bandwagon of hype that surrounded the movie. I am also a James Franco fan, and loved Pineapple Express and was surprised how well he acted in that movie. I also remember him playing James Dean in a TV movie, which also impressed me too. However, it did not prepare me for what I was about to see with this film.Right from the get go you are introduced to the film with the feel of a pulse, from the music that is played during the credits (May I add the use of music throughout this movie was absolutely perfect, and really added so much emotion and texture to the scenes), right through to the use of camera, and the split screen where you see crowds of people going about their daily lives. It then focuses on Franco's character, Aron Ralston. We see quick, cleverly cut and filmed sequences of him preparing for a hike. From intricate, yet simple shots from inside his fridge, to the top of his shelf, with the focus on his hands grabbing these items. I loved these quick shots, and from the start set the kinetic film style and pace. I am not going to spoil anything for you here, but the next 20 minutes of the film is a build up, which is very cleverly done. Anyone that is familiar with the story will appreciate how well the tension is built upon.After the accident occurs, we are left with Aron as he first physically struggles to get himself out of the situation. You really feel that you are there with him. The locations used are beautiful, yet eerie at the same time. After he is physically worn out from trying to escape, you begin to see the psychological breakdown. This is where things get interesting, and really where Franco shines. As we are with him in this situation, you see how his character goes from thinking he will get himself out of this, to a complete breakdown. As he is trapped there for so long, he finds himself dehydrating, and losing the will to live. However, the things that keeps him going, and keeps the audience completely involved and on tender hooks, is the very cleverly crafted flashbacks of what keeps him going. From is family, one of his past girlfriend's right through to some very well executed hallucinations. Often I found myself laughing at the certain things that Franco's character was thinking and dreaming up in his mind, and after the laughter, Boyle would build the tension straight up again and tug on the heart strings with only a few words and expressions from Franco's face. By the end of the movie, you will be there with the character, you will him to go on. I felt that this movie touched on so many things such as spirituality, love, hope and survival and all these common emotions we all share as human beings. At the very end of the movie, the music yet again is used perfectly, and gave me a joyous, almost overpowering feeling of a mixed range of emotions. I still had the adrenaline pumping from 'that' scene I'm sure many of you reading this are aware of (which was also brilliantly done, from the sound effects of shredding nerves, right through the Franco's acting and the use of the camera angles and sfx). As the end drew to a close, I was struggling to hold back the tears as hard as I could, (my girlfriend had been crying intermittently throughout the film, and I couldn't blame her).127 hours It was a joyous, uplifting, spiritual movie experience. It had all the elements of what filmmaking is about. It was a thriller, a drama, a romance, a horror, even comedy at some points all rolled into one. A poignant, timeless message of what is it to be alive, of how blessed we all truly are, and of how reliant we are upon each other. To quite simply put it, this was my favourite movie of 2010/2011, and will certainly go down as one of my favourite movies of all time.",127 Hours
391,trulstei,Amazing!,10,14 August 2016,"What an incredible movie! I struggle to come up with words for how good this was! I didn't watch 1 and a half hour of James Franco being trapped in a canyon, no I was there. Trapped with Aron for the 127 horrific hours he had to spend there. We struggled, we fought and we dreamt. Dreamt about the world around us that had no time to stop, it kept going even though Aron was facing what could possibly be his end (won't spoil ending). I learned who Aron was on this journey, and I loved every second. This movie was a masterpiece, really. The soundtrack did an excellent job helping build up the suspense, I felt like I was in that canyon with him, and I think that is where the greatest achievement for this movie is.There were spontaneous parts in the movie that made me laugh, and parts that actually also brought a little tear to my eye. I was also surprised at the end when I realized this was a true story, that this had actually happened to a real guy called Aron. I guessed it was in the beginning, but I didn't spot any flashy logos screaming ""based on a true story"" in the beginning, and I liked that a lot, I may just be blind though.I'm not the greatest at writing reviews, this is actually the second one I've written, so I may not be the greatest at getting my point across, but I would recommend this movie A LOT!

392,FilmWhinge,Another film with a lot of potential marred by Danny Boyle,5,2 February 2011,"127 Hours is the new film by Danny Boyle, made of the back of the success of Slumdog Millionaire, starring James Franco as Aron Ralston, an extreme sports obsessive, who gets his arm trapped under a boulder for 127 hours. Having gone alone and without having told anyone where he was going, he is stranded. Facing a lack of rations and severe weather conditions, Ralston muses on his relationships with his family and friends, realising that he has foolishly kept everyone at a distance. In the end, he resorts to desperate measures in order to survive.Nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, as well as numerous other accolades, 127 Hours has become something of a surprise hit. However, it has a good many flaws, particularly from a directorial standpoint. Danny Boyle looks and sounds like an absolute chancer. His previous work has been varied at best, with Shallow Grave and Trainspotting being very uneven films that don't work the way they should and Sunshine degenerating from a film with a lot of potential into a stupid and crass slasher film. To put it simply, Danny Boyle's films would be good if someone else made them.127 Hours sees Boyle back to his old tricks. The opening ten minutes employ all sorts of flashy editing tricks, from split-screens to jump cuts. This is done presumably to show how vacuous Ralston's adrenaline fuelled lifestyle is, a form of extroverted misanthropic loneliness. But Boyle doesn't quit. Even when Ralston is trapped to the canyon and largely immobile, the camera jumps all over the place, shooting in and out of the canyon and filming him from inside a water bottle (more of which later). An attempt at creating a mood of isolation and helplessness is constantly undercut by Boyle's prancing and dancing camera. For a proper film about a character stuck alone in a small space see Buried.What's worse is that Boyle's apparent showboating tarnishes everything else in the film. James Franco is very impressive, delivering a performance that is entirely convincing and a genuine step up for the actor. However, Boyle's impatient and jittery film cannot hold a shot long enough for us to feel properly introduced to Franco's character. We rarely even get to have a good view of him, as the shots used prioritise extreme close-ups and shots from behind Franco. We are never given the chance to watch a performance and by the end it doesn't even seem like he has changed all that much. A case in point, the previously mentioned shot from inside Ralston's water bottle. At this point in the film, Ralston decides to just finish his water and be done with it. Here, what is of interest is Franco's performance, playing a man completely at the end of his tether. Instead, Boyle shows us what a water bottle would see when someone is drinking out of it. The shot does not look good and it does not further the drama, it is just ridiculous. And, as such, it is incredibly annoying.Because the final sequence fails to be life affirming and joyous, largely due to the fact that Boyle shoots it like a typically terrible ""X Factor"" human-interest montage (as well as this, the apparently vacuous split-screen sequence returns, destroying any sense that Ralston has been changed for the better by his experience), the end result is a film that feels like it has been sabotaged by a director desperate to be noticed. Every good thing about the film, from its performances to its cinematography to its general theme, is undermined by a camera in constant search of a cool, new angle to shoot from and frenetic editing that won't let you get a good look at anything. A real pity.",127 Hours

Equipped with a half-empty bottle of water, a digital camera, some rope and a (very) dull blade, Ralston must take stock of the situation and figure out a way to escape.The film is tight, pacey and not nearly as boring as it could have been in the hands of a more literal director. Danny Boyle and co. infuse every scene with energy, wowing viewers with panoramic cinematography and drilling the hard truths home when the time comes.Ralston gets his arm trapped a mere 15 minutes in and from then on it's Man vs. Rock. Boyle brings his distinctive brand of energy to the potentially static set-up, with an unpredictable and often inspired soundtrack and the surreal tangents so successfully employed in his early classic, 'Trainspotting'. Though Ralston himself may not move, his mind wanders through old memories and viewers are transported with him.Boyle has a talent for finding the life-affirming elements hidden deep within grim situations and '127 Hours' is nothing if not an exercise in hope and determination. Franco tracks Ralston's fight over the days with a sense of realism that brings the climber's plight into sharp focus, ensuring that there is much more to this film than limb-hacking.The premise is handled well and the cast and crew know the strengths of the story; the scenery is beautiful and the human elements are as familiar as they are sad, brave and ultimately liberating. When the time comes, having accompanied Ralston through his trials and setbacks, you will be there with him when the helicopter lands.",127 Hours
396,Tommychan-1,"Predictable, unexciting and disappointing",4,6 March 2011,"""man goes for a climb, falls down hole and gets trapped, cuts own arm off, misses having two arms a lot"" Sometimes hype surrounding a film is a good thing, it encourages people to talk about it and to view it. The problem with the massive hype about Danny Boyle's latest creation is that it has a very simple story line. Unless you have been sat on the moon you will realize that it is the story of a man who falls down a hole for 127 hours and cuts his arm off. I was aware of this before i watched the film as most people would be. I honestly thought there would be an occasional surprise or at the very least massive suspense created as the victim gets closer to death. For me there was no real suspense, it was just a self indulgent portrayal of a ""loner"" who now realizes hes stuck down a hole with no one to rescue him, if only he wasn't a loner and had told friends where he was going - yawn.At first I was confused with the reception of this film, and the masses of praise it has gathered. But it is really quite simple. Danny Boyle makes good films, and because of his every growing cult status he can do very little wrong. His supporters are somewhat blinded by his aura that they fail to see a pretty bad film when its put in front of them, and read far too far into certain characters and sequences. 127 hours certainly isn't his best work and i'm afraid i found James Franco average at best. He did not portray the pain that the climber would have been in well enough. No surprises, very little dialogue, overrated and predictable. 4/10",127 Hours

I could not detect any character development, although some of the reviewers were exulting about the human spirit etc. What I saw was a reckless alpha-male, who even in that terrible situation kept thinking about females and even attempted to masturbate.

398,benparf,A spiced-up version of Touching the Void,8,9 January 2011,"Danny Boyle's latest exploit tells the true story of a man trapped in a crevasse with a boulder pinning down his right arm for over five days. Unable to free himself, cocky climber, Aron Rolston (James Franco), is driven to cut off the limb with a blunt blade. Had a lesser-known character been in the directing chair then this could have easily been brushed off as another monotonous, slow-moving piece of dross whereby the viewer is left waiting for the inevitable. Remember Open Water? The skeptics will be pleased to hear that the great British filmmaker hasn't lost the plot. 127 Hours is held together by the bursts of intensity that Boyle is renowned for. The camera gets right up as if to smell to Rolston; its gets inside his water bottle; and it buries under his skin. Stylistic finesse is abandoned in favour of an ugly closeness as we see one man degenerate into a urine-guzzling nutter. The most basic of narratives is infused with spouts of paranoia, nostalgia and delirium. As Rolston defiantly stares death in the face, the audience is treated to a series of anecdotes and fantasies. Through this period of self-reflection Aron admits to his own selfishness. He calls out to his mother, his father and his sister. But as his imagination takes over, a sensuous love story develops into bouts of pleasure and heartbreak. Not all of 127 Hours is played out through delusional mind-tricks. Canon must have scooped the biggest product-placement deal of 2011 as much of Aron's confessions and messages are recorded on a hand-held video-camera. His rendition of a morning talkshow is a particular highlight. Having been tortured through the cheesy 'snapshot' sound-bites, one can only feel a sense of frustration and disappointment that this real-life documentation is not revealed in the credits, at least. Instead, we are introduced to the real Aron Rolston through a pathetically banal on-sofa-with-wife-and-baby shot. The soundtrack is drawn, in part, from popular music. Though this may sometimes feel misplaced, it makes the film work in mysterious ways, juxtaposing Bill Withers' 'Lovely Day' to a scene of screaming agony. At the darkest of moments horrific shudders of a cracking bone thunder through the audience. Yet the overwhelming audio-effect is to build up the feel-good factor of what would otherwise have been rather grim film.Boyle has blasted out a spiced up version of Touching the Void Never to give a roller-coaster ride. Full of guilty cinematic pleasures, 127 Hours is worth seeing on the big screen. Never before has such a limited plot been executed with such vibrancy. If nothing else, 127 Hours will make you increasingly sentimental about your right arm.",127 Hours

Aron realizes that he has to make the toughest decision of his life: Die there sad and alone regretting his selfishness to his family or cut his arm off with a cheap pocketknife and have his redemption. No one knows where he is, he has no phone (which even if he did he would have no signal). All he has is a cheap pocketknife (which I already mentioned), rope, a carabiner, a camera, some batteries, a camel back with no water in it, and a bottle with only a few milliliters of water. So pretty much Aron is screwed.Only a few hours before his incident Aron met two women hiking in that canyon. There names are Megan and Kristi. For all Aron knows these two people could be the last people he ever sees.As Aron is in that dip he has a whole lot of time to think about all of his decisions. He films him self in that dip with his camera and tells about his regrets. He regrets that he never returns his mom's calls. He regrets that he went to that canyon that weekend after he promised his sister that he would rehearse with her for her wedding. Aron comes to realization that all of this was his fault, that this boulder had been waiting for him an the only way to have his redemption and get a new life is to cut his arm off.WARNING: Do NOT read the following paragraph if you haven't heard this story of Ralston already! It contains spoilers.That cheap pocketknife Aron has is what saves him, because in the third act Aron makes the decision to cut the arm off. Aron lives and has a happy life from there on, although he has to walk miles without an arm before he finds people to help him. He fixes all the messed up decisions he made and gets that redemption I've been talking about.This film is nothing less than spectacular. Boyle's incredible direction plus the amazing performance by Franco make this a masterpiece. But if you want to see this movie you have to get use to Franco's face because you'll be seeing it quite a bit in this movie.Also, because there's hardly any characters the emotional depth that they the filmmakers had to put in each and every character is tremendous. And they succeeded at putting that emotionality into each and every character.This could have very boring, and I mean VERY boring.

I can assure you will not be disappointed although having high expectations. The movie has an ace performer and newly discovered of incredible amount talent is none but James Franco. He has given his heart to this film. It's a challenging role with minimum dialogs and pretty much expressions only. The movie literally turns you into Ralston's character and makes you feel the helplessness of that deadly circumstance. The movie is well written and well built character of Ralston with it's heart-felting performance by Franco keeps your mouth open. Coming to the score of the movie I can say truly that I came into tears especially in that last scene when Franko drinks water from the muddy pond,gets up holding the water bottle,runs and calls for help. And finally those guys looks back and runs to him. Its is a moment that captures your heart and eyes get wet every time you see it. Apart from Franco and Boyle, a huge accomplishment by A R Rahman who has given a truly Emotional and Inspirational score which gives a feeling that you have achieved your life back over your death just now. This is a kind of movie rather experience which stays in your heart for long time even if you want you to wipe it out. I can tell u one thing for sure, this is kind of Inspirational and Important movie (like Shawshank Redemption) which u definitely wouldn't have watched in recent past years.",127 Hours
401,viviandance,Best movie of the year,10,5 February 2011,"Nothing is more powerful than the will to live. This is what 127 hours is about. It is a survival tale of a man trapped in an isolated canyon in Utah when a rock fell and crushed his arm against the boulder walls and who ultimately made it out 6 days later with sheer determination. 127 hours marks another remarkable feat by Academy Award Winner director Danny Boyle, best known for his 2008 critically acclaimed heavyweight Slumdog Millionaire.The film takes off at a dizzying fast pace with random montages of spectators in large sporting events, people hustling and bustling in their lives, leaky faucets, the film's protagonist Aron Ralston (played to pitch perfection by James Franco) packing in a haste and others in a split screen which initially struck out as erratic but are anything but random as they fall into pieces towards the end. The film wastes no time in diving straight to the plot as twenty minutes into the movie, the action begins when paradoxically Aron becomes entrapped.The next 127 hours (remaining 74 minutes of screen time) chronicles his deteriorating physical conditions and psyche ranging from denial (this is insane), frustration, longing, acceptance and finally the surge of willpower after having a premonition which prompted him to make the hardest decision he's ever made that led to his survival. Like any good piece of cinematic art, the performance of the actors are central to the integrity of the film. And here, James Franco delivers the most riveting performance of his career that solidified him as an immensely talented and serious actor in Hollywood. The film is essentially a one man show with the supporting cast appearing in early parts of the movie and in his flashbacks but we never get bored with Franco. Every facial expression showed his defeat and waning exhaustion with genuine emotions while his resourcefulness and self parodying moments are huge likability factors. However, it is his epiphanies through the life and death situation in which he came to recall what is important in his life that truly made a connection.The clever uses of Boyle's signature psychedelic flashbacks and hallucinations are brilliantly interwoven into and seamlessly edited in the film which provided an in-depth character development as well as heightened our senses on Aron's desires. The multiple camera angles are explored and utilized in every possible way to fully capture Aron's predicament yet not make the audience feel claustrophobic although shot in a very narrow and contained space. The cinematography is visually stunning as we get landscape and aerial views of the canyons in its full glory. Its amazing how nature can make us feel so miniscule while we enthrall in its beauty. The CGI effects are outstanding at the torrential storm scene but most importantly, the epic score by A.R Rahman stole the show for me. The dark and urgent pounding of tribal beats and the pull of a string instrument when Aron struck a nerve (literally) is most effective but it is the spiritually uplifting music at the end of the movie when Aron is rescued that conveys the gratuitous feelings of being alive in all of us.127 hours is extremely emotional, captivating, spectacular, stylistic and story telling at its best. It is a not to be missed movie of the year that stands out above the rest and is in a class of its own.",127 Hours

However, the reason for a 9 rating, I am disappointed that the writers did not cover the concerns of family, friends, or the employer of Aaron missing for 127 hours. Perhaps the writers intent was to focus on the actual event - not the background of the story. But, I believe the writers could have incorporated a small amount of filming to tell more of the story.Put yourself in Aaron's position. Could you overcome what he did? Until you were in his position, for that long, only then you would discover your unknown capabilities. The reality, I believe most people would not like to sit in a car, chair, or one spot, the amount of time he did, even if you had food and water.

405,xkhushali,"Inspiring, strong movie.",10,19 November 2011,"As I was watching this movie for the first time, I instantly knew it would find itself on my favorite movies list. ""127 Hours"" is a movie about a man named Aron Ralston, an everyday guy with a passion for mountain climbing and anything outdoors, who winds up stuck on the line between life and death- or rather, between freedom and a boulder. He is pinned by his arm against a canyon wall and has to take a stab at surviving. It is based on a true story.I have a lot of respect for Danny Boyle. I have always loved his style of directing, so I was keen to see what his next project would be after ""Slumdog Millionaire"" swept the Oscars in 2008. I had heard this story many times before, so I was instantly interested in how Boyle would turn this tragic story into a big screen movie. He did not disappoint. One of my favorite things about the movie is that Danny Boyle stayed really close to the actual story. The real Aron Ralston said so himself that the movie is as accurate as you can get while still being a drama.Boyle made the right choice in bringing back A. R. Rahman to score the movie. The music is what completed the movie, in more ways than it would affect other movies because of the situation. There are scenes that portray just plain emotion, and the music adds a whole new level of depth to these scenes. The soundtrack is chilling, yet so beautiful.Casting-wise, James Franco was perfectly cast as Aron Ralston. I was a fan before, but this movie doubled my respect for him. His performance was astonishing and completely believable.Before I watched this movie, questions were floating in my head. Will this whole movie take place in the canyon? Will it be boring? Will it be sickening? No, no, and yes. About 70-75% of the movie does take place inside the canyon, but it does not get boring. Flashbacks and hallucinations fill up some time here, but during this portion of the movie (in the canyon), you feel as if you are in there yourself or that Aron is talking to you personally. The movie is very intimate. That even applies to the squeamish moments. There IS a lot of blood. Do not be surprised if you find yourself looking away from the screen at some parts (I could not help it).While watching this movie, I felt anticipation. I felt fear. I felt. optimism. I laughed. I cried. This movie truly is the whole package. I highly recommend everyone to see this movie at some point in their life. It is eye-opening and will make you wonder...what would you do if you were in Aron's shoes?",127 Hours

But the scene which saved his arm is a bit miserable. Because there are many blood there. By the way, i liked the landscape of the nature. This scenes enriched the film of 127 hours. For me, there are two main idea in this film. First one is inevitability. Because first time he could not find way out. It is the indicate of inevitability. The other main idea is determination. He was determined person. If someone be determined he will success many thing. Generally, Danny Boyle who the director of film is do a good job. In one scene, there many event. Congratulations Danny Boyle.",127 Hours
407,Superarcadia,Excellent Emotional Life-Affirming Treasure....,10,21 November 2010,"(***Minor spoilers alert****) I would like to take a moment to thank Danny Boyle and all involved in constructing this Beautiful film. From the word go you can see the bright soul of Aron Ralston as he traverses the rocky landscape; a kind passionate-spirit with loads of energy (A Beautiful and fascinating performance by James Franco~!) that brought waves of emotions and brought contrast to myself, having lived too long with habitual self-deprecation; this film reaffirms and reawakens that warm, kind, excited spirit too frequently lurking and oppressed in the shadows. His enthusiasm for life: from the moment Aron screams with joy (while recording himself) because he's alone and free in the beautiful red rock country of Moab, Utah(!), to the moments traversing the landscape of his mind, where he imagines escaping by flight, by water, and by sheer speed... Cheers to the moments his hallucinations further illuminate his humanity, bursting with a desire to survive...to liveand live again.",127 Hours

I came in expecting a simple tale of survival, but instead I found myself completely entranced by the story telling. Great visuals help to put you there in between the crevice walls and really make you experience the toll of the situation. The director and actor work together to portray a wide range of emotions and despite what you'd think the film never seems slow. Boyle even manages to achieve many moments of surrealism within it all. Imagine the terrifying and dark premise, and yet there are nicely done moments of comedy that fit in quite nicely. Of course, a large part of the film's effectiveness is the casting of James Franco. Words can't describe how awesome he was from start to finish. As an added bonus, it's one of those rare treats that for the most part lives up to its true-story basis. I highly recommend the film.",127 Hours

Yet we want to see it for ourselves out of curiosity if the story is somewhat interesting after hearing the headlines. Isn't that true of every true story that is portrayed on film? People have commented that Aron Ralston is a loner and an idiot and give the movie 2 stars or less. How is that a bad comment about the story in the film? The character himself, and therefore the real person, calls himself these very things! As a loner, he felt invincible, yet as a self declared ""idiot"" he has the intelligence to admit how stupid of a thing he had done. Yes, we can all sit on our little chairs and watch the movie and call him an idiot for not telling anyone where he's going or what he's doing... like we've NEVER done something idiotic before. Sure, perhaps our very own moment of lack of good judgment has not put us in a situation that we may have sealed our own doom...for Ralston he had to come to terms with himself that, indeed he may have just killed himself unintentionally.People also commented that he survives by sheer luck. To them I say, can YOU survive for 6 days doing the same things Ralston did? Forget the idea that you would never be so stupid. The point is, if it were to happen to you, what would YOU have done? Would you even have stopped for a moment to leave a video for your loved ones-loner that you are?People still commented that Ralston felt no pain. We could dismiss the initial accident as being in shock. Later on he shows a great deal of pain...and ingenuity. When I myself had an oops moment with a stupid chainsaw cutting a hole in my knee, I didn't feel one ounce of pain. I just kept saying to myself, how could I be so stupid to have not been more careful. If you only hated this movie because it is about one person for most of the film stuck in a canyon, hallucinating about life, screaming out for help ONCE and hating yourself for doing so because you know no one is out there to hear you and you know yelling is futile (by the way people commented that they would be yelling out - for what? save your energy and look for other viable solutions idiot!), contemplating taking your own life because of your incredible mistake you've made, making a final decision - one that would leave you ""crippled"" - and I mean no offense to amputees, still knowing that even without your right arm you still have to carry your bloodied self, weak from dehydration and having lost over 40 pounds in 6 days (I kid you not), to the HOPE of safety...if you hated this movie for reasons such as these...then you've never had a true ""oops"" moment.

412,aaron1510,An absolutely fantastic film.,8,18 January 2011,"127 Hours tells the famous tale of Aron Ralston, a charismatic mountain climber and general sport enthusiast, who through a series of ill fated decisions became trapped in Blue John Canyon in Utah, in mid 2003. His arm had been crushed and lodged between a boulder and a canyon, effectively imprisoning him. He told nobody where he was going. Literally nobody. The movie details the 127 Hours that he is stuck there - his efforts to survive with what little rations he had, the psychological impact of his entrapment, and of course as I'm sure everyone knows at this stage, his escape.This is a very very good movie, and is well worthy of the accolades that it will undoubtedly receive. It does seem on paper as an extremely difficult, if not impossible movie to make, given that most of the screen time is dedicated to Ralston, played by James Franco, sitting in what is essentially his tomb. However, Danny Boyle, through fantastic writing with Simon Beaufoy, and slightly less than fantastic directing has delivered a ninety four minute film that simply does not get boring.Indubitably, James Franco is the star of the show here. He owns the role he plays. I truly believed in him as Aron Ralston, which is a rare thing in a movie, particularly a biopic. At no point in the film does his performance feel laboured, despite the fact that for much of the movie, it is just you and Franco one on one, with nothing to distract you from his performance. From the extreme highs, to the extreme lows in Ralston's five days you really feel like you're with him. His incessant cockiness never alienates you from his character, if nothing else it serves to bring you closer to the character, to root for him in his time of demise. If this was any other actor, I feel the opposite may be true. For someone so charismatic and free-spirited, this is the ultimate torture. Colin Firth was fantastic in The King's Speech, but James Franco is better. I do feel Franco owes much of his performance to Beaufoy/Boyle's writing, but that can be said vice versa too. It just works.Given all of this, I do feel the direction of the movie left something to be desired. I haven't seen Slumdog Millionaire, or indeed any of Danny Boyle's other movies, but I wasn't a lover of how he made this movie. Don't get me wrong, I'm not going to say he was horribly awful or anything of the sort, but I got the distinct impression that Boyle got spooked at the idea of filming Franco in a canyon for over an hour and felt the need to add in plenty and plenty of special effects to keep the viewer entertained. For me, this was a foolish move. The tri-split screen thing, the irrelevant cheering crowds, the in your face action at the start, kind of bothered me, particularly as the movie pushed on. It's my opinion that the film could have been better had it relied solely on Franco's performance, had Boyle had more faith in it maybe, if the movie was more purely a dramatic piece. Maybe I'm just picky. It didn't stop me loving it too much.The now infamous arm scene towards the end, well, it doesn't deserve half the discussion it's getting. In fact none of it. It's a bit bloody, and in the context of the movie it's heart wrenching, but from what I'm reading and hearing it's becoming the selling point of the movie. People are going to see, or indeed not going to see 127 Hours due to how realistic the scene is. It is a fantastic scene. Fantastic fantastic fantastic. I just hope hope hope it doesn't undermine Franco's performance. Go see this movie if you like a good drama. That's what it is, and it's up there with the best of them because it's one that drags you down and pulls you right back up a dozen times over. James Franco truly blew me away and if he doesn't get the Oscar for Best Actor I will eat my hat and various other items of clothing.",127 Hours

I thought of it as a marketing gimmick.But no more....because of two reasons. First, I myself came near to one. Secondly, another guy in the theater actually got one and paramedics had come to the theater! This movie is that awesome! Director Danny Boyle has the mastery to get the viewer engaged with one actor and one place. There is no fancy special effects or anything. Pure intensity. Whatever James Franco is going through, you also become a part of that. When he is thirsty, it is so realistically shot, that you also start feeling thirsty! The angles from which he has taken the scenes (like free jump into the water in between the rocks; inside the water bottle etc) are just amazing This movie is just too great too be described here.

Watched the movie and lost 2 hours from my life (including writing this comment), story is nice, but can't say same thing to the movie, it was really boring, definitely doesn't deserve to be in top 250..

Simplistic but Franco's performance carries this movie and I really mean that because of the plots simplicity but it had to for the film to be successful. It pulls you in from an almost point of view for most of the movie so you almost feel trapped but on edge with the character thinking of ways to bust yourself free. Rarely do I say a film should be longer but with this one it could and should have been. I say this because I found myself feeling bad for him but barely crying. It didn't feel quite right. While at the end I did cry. After finishing it I thought for a bit about how it just jumped into him being out and about and while that was necessary, I felt it lacked a very strong emotional attachment to the character I was searching for. Perhaps a more front story to see a stronger attachment to family or friends before being lodged by the boulder would have gave this movie a better rating. Regardless it was a good movie and definitely worth a watch.",127 Hours

I was really excited, because I'm a big fan of survival stories and I already knew this one because Bear Grylls mentioned it on ""Man Vs. Wild"", which is a show I watch a lot. Unfourtunetely, this movie's premiere here in Portugal was last week, that's about two months after the American premiere. That meant I would have to wait a long time to see this movie. I could have downloaded it, but I wanted to see this movie with good quality and subtitles so I waited. It was hard but, oh boy, it was all worth it!!!I loved how the movie started, it started quickly, with great music and editing. I couldn't ask for more!I just think the part when Aron falls into the crevasse should have more emphasis. It was because of that fall that the movie was made and that Aron did what he did.. I think they should have added some slow-motion. :)The scenes from the crevasse have a different meaning with James Franco. He is perfect for the role and he can make us live Aron's drama is such way that sometimes it looks we are also there. Brilliant! Anguish, sadness, happiness, joy... ""127 Hours"" and James Franco can make us laugh and cry and the same time; it's such a great movie!The infamous amputation scene was not painful to watch. I don't like horror movies, because all of the gory and bloody scenes, so I was a bit afraid of this scene. But I could watch the scene without closing my eyes or even covering or turning my face away. It's really no big deal, but fortunately for me, a girl got out of the cinema after that scene and that made me win a bet with my friends! :PI've already watched ""The King's Speech"", so I know what Colin Firth did in that movie. He was amazing and deserved the Academy Award for Best Actor, but if it wasn't for him, I think Franco should have won it. He's great.Overall, it was an amazing movie, although it was too short, but I guess that most people don't want to see a guy talking alone in a crevasse for 2 hours. I wouldn't mind! I was not hoping such a quiet movie, but I loved it. When it finished, I wanted to see it again and I probably will see it again next week with more friends.I really think everybody should see this movie. Don't avoid it, just because of the amputation scene. If you are fragile, close your eyes, you will know when it's over because of the music (by the way, the music from that scene is great).Probably my favorite movie.",127 Hours

In went too much in depth in terms of character development, one that while entertaining not necessary.Great work by the writers making a whole movie out of this.Overall, you won't be disappointed if you're expecting to sit for a movie with rating 6 or 7 out of ten.If you liked it, then watch ""I shouldn't be alive"" the episodes are shorter and there is much more going on.",127 Hours

420,magdalena-waz,"127 Hours packs punch, delivers message?",8,5 December 2010,"I knew James Franco's character was going to cut his arm off, but I wasn't seriously worried until I was walking up the ramp to theater #7 where I noticed a small white sign taped to the wall. It reminded viewers of the one graphic scene that had caused viewers to feel sick and almost faint. And then I realized what I had actually signed up to see, how every single shot in the film would hint at his entrapment and his eventual escape. I was sweaty and scared during shots at the beginning in which James Franco simply ran his hands across smooth rocks. That is effective filmmaking. But from now on, I don't think I'll mention the arm thing, which was harrowing, but I think Danny Boyle didn't want to make it the focus of the entire film.Here's why. There's a framing device used, shots of people on a crowded train platform, fans in a packed stadium, cars on a highway, all emphasizing the multitude of people everywhere else, except for where Aron Ralston was trapped. We get the sense that he wanted to be alone, and while I haven't read the book he wrote, I'm going to assume that this is something he had written about extensively. This is about as much as we get in terms of character development...and really about as much as we can expect, and as a result, a lot of the flashbacks revolve around his experiences with an ex-girlfriend, which allow us to escape the ridiculously claustrophobic conditions in the canyon, and also shows us what would prompt a person to go somewhere so lonely without letting anyone know where he was going.This makes the people helping Aron in the end seem like they're functioning symbolically as well. He needs people to survive. He has learned his lesson. It's no longer just a factual account, and I respect the desire to incorporate a small arc, or a small emotional change into such a big, terrifying, and life-altering experience.But did it work? Kind of. It was visceral. It made me at first want to get away from the crowds and the noise, and then it made me want to go right back, to never be alone.And all of it, really, was pretty (odd thing to say for something so gruesome). A combination of the colors from Slumdog Millionaire and the movement and effects from 28 Days Later.Dare we say that Danny Boyle is an auteur?

Danny Boyle is the director and he did an excellent job. James Franco is the core of the enjoyable part of this movie. Not to say that he was the only enjoyable part, but he made the experience so much better. He's funny when he needs to be, sad when he should be, and overall, the most enjoyable actor of 2010, in my opinion. I've seen this movie three times, and I'm making arrangements to see it again. The cinematography was the most striking part of the experience. The camera-work was stunning, and greatly portrayed as James Franco, (or Aron Ralston I should say) went through the troubles to free himself.

Who would imagine the story of a man stuck in a canyon could be so full of a powerful message. I had heard a lot about Ralston's unfortunate adventures while living in Colorado where this man lived at the time. I was a backpacking guide and was in many conversations about all the safety precautions he could have done to allow his rescuers to find him. Despite the lack of characters and a complicated plot line or even dialogues. I was blown away with how the film-maker chose to create this story of unfortunate events into a work that asks us a great question. As Ralston was brought to a place of possibly slowly coming to the end of his existence he questioned the purpose and significance of his life. His regrets and all the broken relationships he would leave behind. I think this is a wake up call for him to realize that the true significance in our world is not adventure and thrills but it is found relationships. We all choose to find fulfillment in things but when it comes down to it we want to know we have been loved and loved others well. I think this film gets to this question in a beautiful and raw way. I think it places us in the same slot canyon with the same question we see Ralston asked. Does my life matter?

Tug away at the smaller rock, so that when it dislodges and pulls on the rope, the problem rock moves. Whatever. I don't know.

425,jacobjamessturgess,Boyle somehow manages to make 127 hours of pain and fear delightfully uplifting,8,16 March 2011,"127 Hours is the harrowing account of one man, Aron Ralston, and his six day battle with nature. This true story documents the time Aron spent pinned by the arm to the wall of an isolated Utah canyon until he is able to, horrifically and with great sacrifice, free himself. If the thought of 92 minutes of cinema set predominantly in three square metres of sunless canyon seems a little too heavy, I implore you do not be put off. Danny Boyle is at his finest here, and conjures from the sterility of the situation a thoroughly entertaining and uplifting journey. Quite a task this must have been too, one can only applaud Boyle for not slipping into the kind of tooth grinding, headache inducing endurance test such enclosing subject matter often brings forth from directors - Rodrigo Cortés' Buried, comes to mind. But no indeed, 127 Days escapes such pitfalls (no pun intended) and is a masterful, enjoyable and massively entertaining piece of cinema. Boyle's outstanding direction of such an iconic story would, however, be left inert without such an engaging and ambitious performance from the (might I say oddly cast) James Franco. The actor seamlessly slips between the easygoing humour to which he must by now be accustomed, and something much darker and deeper. Franco far from shies away from the demands of such a difficult and demanding role, and instead throws himself commendably into the unfamiliar territory of immense and delicate emotion. The opening scene shows adrenaline junkie Aron (Franco) excitedly preparing for his trip to the canyons. Viewers who are aware of Aron's story prior to watching the film will cringe as his fingers search fruitlessly for his Swiss Army knife, inches out of reach at the back of a cupboard. (Those who aren't aware will cringe later on). Impatiently he sets off, and through the hustle and life of the split screens (owing to Boyle's talented editor Jon Harris) Aron's journey away from civilisation begins. Franco's vigour and vivacity are apparent from the moment he puts his headphones on and races off on his mountain bike, A. R. Rahman's eclectic soundtrack resonating in his eardrums. On his way he runs into two like-minded, free spirited hikers (Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn) who had gotten lost among the trails. While he gives them his own guided tour of the canyons the two girls who serve as the only real- time conversation in the vast majority of the film, and soon after they part ways Aron's life changing accident happens. In hastily traversing a narrow canyon, Aron dislodges a boulder which falls, crushing his right arm against the stone. The 27 year old, who has been racing round with blistering pace since the opening scene is now locked in place, and the next 127 hours of the his life are spent in this horrifying predicament. Unable to dislodge his arm nor move the boulder, and with no phone, minimal equipment, and only one bottle of water, Aron's mind becomes a hub of panic and mania. It is here that we see Franco's most credible acting to date. The actor maintains his affable humour, which comes across well in the imaginary chat show discussion about his entrapment (the conclusive word of which being a quiet, dry 'oops') but what is most commendable about his performance is its uncharacteristic subtlety. With no dialogue Franco must react and respond only to his character's thoughts and actions, and he does so flawlessly, succeeding with the smallest of gestures or expressions to communicate the grave reality of his fear. The film's crescendo is the most visceral and thigh-clawingly graphic moment in the film. In reality, Aron spent 45 minutes with the dull blade separating his body from the rock, but its screen time is, mercifully, much reduced. In vividly portraying the impromptu amputation Boyle is not simply employing shock tactics to repulse his viewer with the gore of the episode. Instead one gets the impression that the scene is far from excessive, and is in fact, commendable in its refusal to shy away from the physicality which lies at the heart of the story. One particular tendon succeeds in inducing a similar reaction from the viewer as from Aron himself before it is stretched and broken with a resounding snap. At the end of it all, there is a sense that not just the amputation, but the course of the entire story is accurately and honestly produced. Aron Ralston had received a huge number of offers from producers since the event in 2003 before finally allowing 127 Hours to be made and ultimately, one gets the impression that justice had been done to the story, if the closing scene's are a little sickly sweet. In spite of everything it's loud and alive, immensely entertaining, and above all uplifting. I challenge any viewer not to smile with genuine content as the credits begin to roll.",127 Hours

What made the epiphany genuinely real, is, as opposed to epiphanies related to Religion, Politics, Societal conflicts, this one rose from a near-death experience, which tends to be the most honest one of all. Cheers to Danny Boyle for having achieved very hard directing, namely shooting 90% of the movie with one character having introspections on himself- this could have easily been a calamity, it was anything but!

First of all it's a true story giving the audience a very personal experience and view into what Aaron Ralston experienced. I wasn't a story made up to be exciting and thrilling. It's not fiction, it's REAL life. And in real life someone trapped under a rock for 127 hours would probably talk to themselves, reminisce, fantasize, hallucinated, and either reach a point of complete insanity as to cut off his own arm to get free, or die because he gave up and felt completely hopeless. While I watched this movie I recall how I felt when I was held captive in a room for nine months in another country with an abusive husband. I left the US with him and went to Mexico, being a loyal wife, as he ran from imprisonment. It was there he went crazy on me and began to abuse me because he was losing his mind and knew I missed my family and regretted leaving with him and out of my loyalty and trying to protect him, when at the time I believed he was innocent of his crime, I never told my family where I was and never called them when I was there. Then, he locked me in a room and beat me and starved me. How does my story relate to this in anyway? You might ask. It is just simply the human experience of being alone and having to fight for your life. I don't know what's worse, being completely in the middle of nowhere with no human contact whatsoever and wishing for just one person to see you and immediately gain hope you will be rescue somehow. Or, being trapped by another human being who at any moment will decided to take your life if you don't fight for it the the best way you know how. I survived. I was,'t rescued. It took drastic measures to make my escape with nothing but the shirt on my back. Five years later I have a happy life of freedom and I know I could be dead now if I didn't fight for my life. All the feelings Aaron has in this movie I experienced and that's why it moved me. I was in tears when Aaron apologizes for not answering his mom's calls. I was the same way. You NEVER know what life might hand you and NO ONE can escape to possibility that your life may take a sudden turn and everyone has things they might want to have done or not done if faced with a life or death situation. So for everyone who was bored, go watch something else. This isn't meant to be exciting. It's meant to make you see what a man went through and have he survived.Yes he made some dumb decisions. No phone, no GPS. But real human beings do stupid stuff sometimes don't we? Why fault the film and call it stupid? This is what happen to him. It's his story. Period. I loved this film, and every time I forget what really matters in life, I watch it to remind me just how precious life and family and friends who care about you really are. This movie is inspirational and remarkable.",127 Hours

When I began to watch this movie, I didn't guess a theme like in the movie but it is really interesting and worth to see. 127 hours is a psychological and tragic movie and sometimes it may be boring. Because it has a few scenes and mostly, there is a scene and it is showed generally. Apart from these, I shocked when I learned that this movie is taken from in an real event. I didn't know it before and even after I watched movie. After I learned it, all of scenes of the movie came to my mind and it really difficult, depressing, incredible and painful situation. I said to myself that it is a big courage. There is a young man and while he was walking around, he dropped in a place where is 50 meters under of the ground and whose arm pressed between two rocks and he stayed in that situation along 127 hours. Then he had to cut his arm to survive and finally, he was saved by a family. This should be really interesting experience and event and everybody can not do it even for their life.

Anyway Danny did it right this time he is an awesome director anyway. It had good acting in it too. Amber Tamberlyn was great too, even though she was barely in the movie though. It had a lot of scenes where he wasn't trapped in the boulder. I mean I thought it would be bigger, that's what she said. anyway great movie I could watch it again.

A clever use of chilling audio to really drive home the pain that one must feel and combined with Franco's fantastic acting, you really do believe he's just done the unthinkable.If you are tempted to pass this movie based on a predictable plot I would urge you to reconsider if only to experience the awesome filming, camera angles and direction.",127 Hours

Initially when film progressed, great show of all possible angles of cinematography took you somewhere in it and you can't get out of it till the end. How else can you show the vulnerability and restlessness of a dying person, in the middle of nowhere; if not how this film portray.

I am thinking particularly of sons with 4-letter names like Cody or Noah.It is a true story about a canyoner who spends several days by himself trying to survive in one of the narrow crevices in the earth just outside of Canyonlands, Utah.My only criticism is that it lacked character development or insight.

438,naadim-shamji,Check what else is on...,4,22 January 2012,"Although the film had some good things going for it: the human experience of surviving harrowing conditions; the thought processes one must go through in those circumstances, it's mostly unbearable, both for its length and the sense of claustrophobia. Furthermore it really seems as though film wasn't the right medium for this true story, as it severely limits what you can do in terms of plot and drama. On the matter of music, it seems to want to make up for a lack of action at times, and it's rather obtrusive when coupled with those fast camera shots (I didn't enjoy the opening).Furthermore, the dreams and hallucinations seemed more like filler. So I wouldn't recommend this one (unless you can tolerate watching pain, and don't mind the constraints of a fairly linear storyline, and the irritating use of music).",127 Hours

441,kellieanjos,Danny Boyle is the best!,8,16 April 2011,"The tag line of this movie ""There is no force more powerful than the will to live"" says everything about its plot. The story is just about force of will. This movie is based on the true life story of Aron Ralston, who went canyoneering alone in Utah, but he had an accident, and got stuck in a rock fissure with a big rock grabbing his hand. This situation made Aron think about his entire life, and how he had lived it before the accident. He was a very selfish guy, who used to think just about himself, not caring about his family or friends. During the days that he was stuck, he made a reflection about his past and what he wanted to his future, what gave him strength to resist. Talking about the technical aspects of the movie, the main actor, James Franco, fits the role of Aeron. Moreover, the success of the movie has a name, and it is Danny Boyle, who I believe is one of the best movie directors nowadays. He was capable of giving a totally different aspect to the story, creatively merging images from Aron's past and future. I would say that the direction is the most brilliant thing about the movie. Without Danny Boyle, it would be just another drama based on a true story.",127 Hours

444,baylon-kris,An audio-visual representation of genuine human emotion,10,9 February 2011,"It has only been about an hour since I saw this film and I still can't come up with the right words to articulate this overwhelming feeling. Ripping it down to its rawest form presents a very simple story about a man, Aron Ralston, who faces death in doing what he likes the most, canyoneering. This is a film that doesn't rely solely on how the film concludes. Instead, the point is embedded in the longevity of the story in the film itself. It is the experience of getting stuck in what may seem to be just a crack in the middle of a canyon, wherein human emotion in its truest form can still be felt by the audience, that I saw its significance and its relevance. This is a very unlikely plot to generate an experience that represents raw emotions, yet nothing short in authenticity.Putting the plot in the context of filmmaking, there are just too many aspects in this film that are very well put together for me to dissect and criticize. Everything was placed in the right place at the right time. The utilization as well as the style of editing, cinematography, sound editing, sound mixing and musical scoring all worked harmoniously in the audio-visual representation of the story.127 Hours is one of those films where one actor will have to carry the whole film to either its success or its demise. Fortunately, actor James Franco has gone a long way in his acting career by making the right decisions or else, he might not have made it to Aron Ralston's place, stuck in that deep gorge. The true-to-life story adapted in Danny Boyle and Simon Beaufoy's screenplay requires a young character who is extreme and strong-hearted especially during difficult times, yet has his deep relationships with the people around him as both his weakness and his strength. This complicated, yet true of a character, I could not have imagined being portrayed by any other actor.This symphony by Danny Boyle has once again proved himself to be a visionary filmmaker contributing to my world a picture worth consuming.",127 Hours
445,shyalbandan,Danny Boyle's latest film is that of sublime cinematography.,10,2 February 2011,"When I first heard about Danny Boyle's new film '127 Hours', I thought to myself: 'How can a film be made about someone who gets stuck in a hole for 127 hours?' The answer, my friends, is Danny Boyle. Boyle transformed Aron Ralston's true story of survival into the most encapsulating film of the year (so far).Aron Ralson is a climber who must save himself after falling down a pit. His arm stuck by an enormous boulder. He is stuck there for 127 hours, as the title of the films suggests. '127 Hours' would still be a great film if it wasn't a true story. However, the fact that it is based on true events made this even more of a compelling event. Ralston is played by James Franco, known primarily for his role in 'Spiderman'. Franco was perfect for the role. He was tested as he had to show Ralson's sense of humour in a very dark light. Franco had me laughing when he was videoing himself comically whilst stuck in the canyon, yet he had me on the edge of my seat as he amputated his own arm!The cinematography of the film was sublime. Set in an arid canyon in Utah, this was the perfect setting to shoot. Boyle shot from very many angles and distances, creating a pictures on the screen that simply 'blew me away'. The landscape featured was beautifully red in colour.I was kept in suspense from the moment Aron Ralson was trapped under the rock until the moment he freed himself. The amateur climber used very clever survival techniques which I admired greatly. Due to his fatigue, Aron hallucinated about both his current situation stuck under the rock and about his life at home. These hallucinations gave Danny Boyle the perfect opportunity to show off his filmmaking skills. The most potent image is that of Ralson as a child, sitting on his sofa in the middle of a cave: a depiction of the child within us all.The soundtrack by A.R. Rahman complimented the imagery spectacularly. This film is completely different to any other film I have seen. This film is a triumph for Danny Boyle as a director, having to live up to 'Slumdog Millionaire'. '127 Hours' is nominated for the BAFTA for best film which is no surprise to me. A remarkable story shown with exceptional detail!",127 Hours
446,abhishek531,"Unarguably, the BEST.",10,31 January 2011,"This is a movie with a great heart, unbelievable script, super acting, a great director and most importantly a portrayal of a real life superhuman. The moment you enter the theatre, everything keeps you occupied. You don't want get up of the seat for a second, even to pee. I mean it. The minute details, camera work and music everything just complements the film and makes it what I call a masterpiece. At the end of film, you see Aron Ralston (James Franco) and ask yourself a question, 'What on earth was this? Did This happen for real?'. Your heart just fills with respect and honor for the man. You realize the importance of relations, friends and family. I believe watching this super movie is a great inspiration and has had a great positive impact on many. Aron Ralston is a educator and has educated me and millions others. After seeing, you are motivated and ask yourself, ""What on earth were you doing till now? You give up at petty thing without even trying.""The Spirit of Aron can't be put up on this short review but all I can say that it was breathtaking. The adventure he continues now is an inspiration for any living soul. The motto correctly goes with the movie. ""There is no force stronger on earth than the will to live.""All I can say is that if ""Slumdog Millionaire"" kinda crap can win a Oscar, there needs to be a new award invented for this. Even if it doesn't win an Oscar, which I'm sure it will, it has already won a million hearts.",127 Hours

I am falling in love with Danny Boyle's music and direction with each new movie he is involved with. Franco does an amazing job, from his believable athleticism to his very believable delirium. Almost the entire movie shows 1 actor on 1 set, and boredom never entered my emotions. I cannot wait to see what Boyle comes out with next, and i have an extremely increased amount of respect for Franco as an actor. This film does an exceptional job letting you feel the emotion and suffering that the character is going through. The stress created is way worth the relief that you are eventually given. If you haven't seen them yet, Sunshine and 28 Days Later are great movies to give you an idea of what this director is capable of..",127 Hours

ALert! ; )I Walked into the theater to see 127 hours and saw not too many people in the theater. Probably because it had been 3 or so weeks after it came out. And once the movie started, it was a bit weird for me (people going up escalator's , etc....), but then i started noticing the editing. I said to myself: ""Wow... This is mazing!"" The editing in this film was truly amazing. After Aaron runs into the 2 girls, it really shows you that he had a nice spirit and was very adventurous. After getting stuck between the rock, he starts to remember the past in his life.i thought that that was a nice way, in fact a really nice way to make the movie good. I thought, before walking into the theater: ""How will Danny Boyle make you entertained when its just that man stuck between a rock?"" Now Danny Boyle really finds a way in this film to make it to make it entertaining and not boring and and make the film stand out to be not just the guy cutting his arm off but, but finding ways to save himself, remembering he times when he was young and making sure that if he makes it out alive, that he always answers his parents' calls.This films is for me by far the best of the year and i think that it should win best picture ( even though i think that the king's speech or black swan will win) of the year and makes me think of James Franko as a much better actor and Danny Boyle a much better director.

Personally nothing feels forced or wrong, and the effects are believable and realistic.As like most great films the perfect soundtrack accompanies it.

However, I thought it was a great piece of story telling, and very much had me trapped during the duration wondering what if that was me, what the hell would I do. I will not spoil, but I will say I'm not scream-ish, but in one scene I was tested. James Franco played the part very well, and I loved the character he portrayed. I've been through the Nevada desert before and this movie makes me want to go back again and travel that bit further, to a certain extent though. Films about free spirits I am always keen to watch, especially when it doesn't reek of the Hollywood studios. This one gets two thumbs up.",127 Hours

Aaron used to live on his on and never used to return his mothers' calls he never used to tell people where he is going. So the movie starts by him leaving home and going to Blue John Canyon on a Friday night,he spends the night in his car and then in the morning he sets up with his bicycle and rides into the wilderness, you see Aaron meeting with two lovely women and he takes them to a tour after that he leaves them and continues his adventure. Aaron was going deep into the canyons it was -100 meters when suddenly he slipped and on him fell a huge rock, he didn't freak out a lot and just stared at it and then comes my favourite part, when he falls and gets his hand jammed, next to it appears the title of the movie ""127 hours"" meaning yup this is where you're going to spend your 90 minutes. During all this 127 hours getting stuck you see Aaron trying to chip the stone, talk to the camera, leave messages, hallucinate and daydream. Ahh yes daydreaming was what Aaron did a lot, you see him think of the women he liked, partying with his friends and thinking about drinks, for he didn't have a lot of water left with him. Aaron starts to think about his parents a lot and record himself saying how much he loved them, he starts seeing himself when he was 19 years old 10 and 4. And then he realises he has to rise.It is a heart pumping movie, especially when he is left with no choice but to amputate his arm, this is where all the good sound effects come in breaking the bone, cutting of his arteries and nerves. The movie is not just about the rock, it's all about what he has done with his life and it states all the mistakes he has done in his life.

452,rubicon1975,Boring and Gimmicky,3,20 November 2010,"After watching ""127 hours"" by Danny Boyle, I felt like I'd seen nothing. That should not be the case. The movie is way too light for the subject matter. It comes across more like a series of loosely connected commercials or music videos. It's very hard to get into Aron's head. The camera work is way too flashy. The sound work is over-the-top and irritating to the point of getting a headache. What is most puzzling is that they thought the story warranted so much visual/sound nonsense. The gimmicks ruined whatever good stuff the movie could have had. At the end, I felt hollow and annoyed, like I just had a very empty movie experience. A lot of the time, I was really bored, which should not be happening in such a short feature. Last but not least, the product placement in this movie was some of the most blatant/obvious I've ever seen in a Hollywood flick, everything from McDonald's to Canon to Gatorade to Burger King and so on.

I still believe it was a good movie and a powerful one as well. James Franco was great and it surprisingly did not get boring considering the movie consisted of one main character and setting.

But, then again, every second Bollywood movie consists of action, drama and loads of 'masala', so Slumdog was something I'm immune to. A.R.Rahman didn't need two Oscars and the Pussycat Dolls strutting to his number for him to be proved a success. I've seen way better Bollywood actors than Anil Kapoor and we all know that Dev Patel and Frieda Pinto have built a reputation that they themselves will find very hard to supersede. Also, Slumdog Millionaire portrayed India and Mumbai, my hometown, in a negative light. I still have to explain to my Brit friends here in the UK that Mumbai does not consist of slums and that half the customer service calls they make are answered from a place that's 10 minutes from where I live.Based on the book 'Between a Rock and Hard Place' by mountaineer Aron Ralston, 127 Hours is a true story about life and how we need a jolt sometimes to wake us up to the realities that we take for granted. In Ralston's case, it was a very harsh reality that gave him overnight popularity but the ordeal that he went through for 127 Hours changed him as a person. The movies draws parallels with Castaway, or more recently with the Chilean miners in terms of the body's will to survive at any given cost. The thing that stays with you long after 127 Hours is over is James Franco. 127 Hours is a films that will transcended him from an actor with a cute face to a serious talent. Like when Leonardo DiCaprio did Titanic you knew here was a superstar in the making. Franco has been used to playing second fiddle to Spiderman, but 127 Hours is all about him! He brings believability to a character in the throes of duress. The story of Aron Ralston needed a character who could be realistic enough to watch be a carefree bird and adventurer yet bearable to watch severing his hand. Franco has the charm and the suave to be a ladies man, yet hes make you believe each of his hallucinations and makes you laugh at his pain with him during some of the deepest moments of the film. If this performance does not get him a Best Actor nod at the Oscars this year, I'll be tempted to cut off my own hand. How great will it be for an Oscar presenter to win the Oscars. I wonder when was the last time that happened!A.R.Rahman does a fabulous job again with the music. It's challenging because the music could have been dark and morose and still worked well but he works with Boyle's moods in this film turning up the grungy guitars at parts yet hitting hollow strings during its lighter moments. 'If I Rise' is a mellow composition with Dido and himself. It may not be the 'Jai Ho' that the world danced to, but it talks about resurrection within its serene atmospheres, which is the main emotion of the film.Danny Boyle and Simon Beaufoy have outdone themselves yet again. They could have focused on the way Ralston mended his relationships or the fame Ralston achieved after he went home. Yet they chose to keep the film simple. There are barely any secondary characters, yet it is the emotional journey of a man who believes in life. 127 Hours is a story about living and that's exactly how they have panned it out. The shots are mostly close-ups focusing on the emotions of the character and the scenes where he amputates his arm have been done exactly as they may have been done in real life, nothing made 'aesthetic' for the sake of dramatization. When you leave the theater, its like you actually went through that ordeal and few films leave you with that feeling. True, it may have been claustrophobic at times, but thats exactly how they wanted it to be. You could literally feel his pain, his anguish, his despair, his loss and his hope and for that all credit goes to Danny Boyle and James Franco.",127 Hours
457,Charladeeda,The true meaning of an adventure.,8,15 January 2011,"127 is the perfect movie for someone who hasn't thought about their future or doesn't have a lot of hope in life. It's an extremely brilliant adventure that takes you to places you have never dreamt of going to. The movie is based on the book ""Between A Rock And A Hard Place"" by Aron Ralston. The book is about Ralston's life changing week with his arm stuck between a boulder and the Blue John canyon. In the movie, Ralston is played by James Franco (Spiderman, Pineapple Express), who shows such realistic and believable enthusiasm through out the whole film, he really puts his whole heart and soul into acting this role. Its an easy character to mess up, but he doesn't miss his target one single bit. The start of the movie is mainly showing you who Aron Ralston is on the inside, a bit of a stupid and big headed electritionist who doesn't answer his mom's calls and doesn't tell anyone where and what he's up to. After about five minutes of up-beat music and Ralston getting ready for a hike, the scene moves to a desert at about eight o'clock in the morning, and Aron riding a mountain bike to the mighty Blue John canyon. When arriving at the canyon, Aron runs into two girls around about his age, Christie and Megan, who are looking for a 'dome' in the location. Ralston, knowing every inch of the canyon, directs them to the 'dome' with a warm hand shake and nice big grin, he also takes them to a water hole under ground, where they all have fun diving and jumping into the gorgeous blue liquid. After about an hour, Aron leaves the two girls, who also invite him to their party the next night, and runs off to continue his hike. Soon enough, Aron comes to his famous fall and crushing experience, as he jumps off of a ledge, and brings a huge rock down the gap with him, locking his arm in an terribly painful position against the wall of the canyon and the huge chalk stone. Ralston panics but tries to hold himself together, trying to push up the rock from his arm, with no luck, he gets out everything from his ruck sack and finds a blunt pen knife which he uses to try and chip away the rock with. after a few days of recording his days and still chipping away at the rock, Aron comes to the idea of cutting of his arm, but the pen knife isn't very sharp for that sort of thing, so he gives up and ponders through other possibilities of how to get himself out of this mess. Ralston starts having visions of his past and epiphanies of how he would re-start his life if he gets the chance. He pictures his close families and friends all sitting on and around a couch, and the next vision is of a small boy, possibly being either himself at a younger age, or his future child (which Aron Ralston later has in late February 2010) but, after seeing this young boy, he realise what he has to do, he breaks both bones in his arm and well, you know the rest. After going through this whole tear-jurking struggle of keeping faith in himself Ralston starts to reconstruct his entire life, he continues to hike and climb mountains, but he ""always leaves a note, to tell people where he's going"" -this movie really is a phenomenon and a real pleasure to watch, even with a bit of gore here and there. James Franco just is Aron Ralston, i could not imagine a better actor for this part. I can gladly say its my favourite film to watch in the cinema at the moment, and i will definitely be getting it on DVD when it is released. Thank you Aron Ralston for taking us on this beautiful journey of inspiration.",127 Hours

However as far as films go this is drawn out. In some respects I suppose it is as expected. Lots of deep breathing and over done focus on a chap stuck down a hole. Thankfully, his moments of delirium,brings a little variety to the all too long and drawn scenario. Felt the film was more for the geek rather than someone wanting to see something enjoyable. I had hoped for a little more about the character and more to surround the scenario giving it build up. These aspects were lost. Given Danny Boyle's previous films have been of such an impeccable standard, this film has certainly not come up to that grade. Perhaps though taking such a minimalist theme was just a step to far.",127 Hours

There is no arguing this mans determination, grit and human strength; I also have no doubt in my mind that this makes an amazing tale and book. However, there really is only so long you can spin out a guy falling down a hole and getting trapped and it isn't 90 minutes, not by a long shot. It becomes tedious, also you have no sense of love for this character,he comes across as a reckless fool, perhaps they should of built up his character more in the first half and then him have his accident?So yeah, 1* for the amazing tale and the thing it could have been, -9* for the thing it isn't -Emma",127 Hours
461,dapgray,Human suffering trivialised by YouTube type treatment,3,26 January 2011,"I feel compelled to write my first IMDb review after seeing this film in the same week that I also saw the Kings Speech. Both films have a very basic premise that requires some imaginative screenplay to sustain them. Climber falls down ravine but survives after resorting to desperate measures; Man becomes become King unexpectedly and has to overcome speech defect. The results of both dramas are already known before the films were made. So Danny Boyle decides to rework Trainspotting to give his story some legs - man cycling/running across landscape to pumping music,liquid/ drugs travelling down tubes, flashback/hallucinatory images, gross out gore etc etc. We have seen it all before including Shallow Grave . Has DB a lavatorial fetish ? Man dives down excrement filled lavatories in both Trainspotting and Slumdog now he drinks urine and dives into fetid puddle in 127. Throughout, the struggle is trivialised with gimmickry, and the hero evokes no sympathy; now in comparison I even empathise with Joe Simpson in Into the Void ! Yet Kings Speech relies on splendid dialogue, appropriate soundtrack and quality acting with the mild outrage of the f word. The lasting message of 127 is a Health and Safety moral - always tell someone where you are going and make sure you take your Swiss Army Knife. No more than that . An Oscar , I hope not. However none of the above should detract from Aron's bravery, his story deserved more sympathetic treatment.",127 Hours
462,talsfan,Meaningful ?,1,29 September 2011,"Many may say that this movie (which is based, as far as i read in FAQ, on real facts - autobiography) is meaningful or emotional or a way of understanding the aspects of life better or anything. I strongly disagree with all these statements.Even if this movie is based on true story, the way it presents the course of events is totally problematic, in my opinion. Everything seem so unreal and unrealistic even to the extent to think that this movie was underestimating the watcher's intelligence. Besides being really boring, this film shows in fact nothing meaningful or deep. It's only ""strength"" is that it is based on a true story. But, on the whole, it's maybe the worst movie i have seen so far this year at least (and i have seen quite a lot, to be honest). I consider it a mere stupidity and that watching this is just a bad way of spending your time.",127 Hours
463,Fotboll-sport,A situation that you absolutely never want to end up in,4,5 March 2011,"Do not usually like these films where for example is stuck out at sea or things of that sort. But I must admit that this was really good. Not the year's best film, but it is still good. Was a little surprised when I saw that the director was the one who had directed the film ""Slumdog Millionaire"". Did that ""Slumdog Millionaire"" was a LOUSY movie that lacks most of the time. There was the ""127 Hours"" a major step forward from the ""Slumdog Millionaire"". So I give ""127 Hours"" a 4 of 5. If I'm going to be critical, it felt as if the cameraman was standing on one foot. It shakes a lot and changing angles too quickly. I saw many mistakes with the camera as the changing angles and when things are different, and other stuff that they should be more careful. According to me the camera stand up straight, and ""sometimes"" move slowly to the sides, do not change angles so quickly. It will shake and change angles quickly as it should be exciting, when there is some action. This movie did almost nothing about what I wrote up. So that's a big minus. So therefore the number 4 a weak 4: a. Camera: IG! James Franco is playing well in the role of Aaron. He is a bit of the feeling that it should be if you sit down with your hand over a giant boulder, and dying. Bothered me a bit of the movie when he thought that he came out of the stone, and went away with the car, and so on ... I think that a movie should be as it is, and not hold on to dream of things that have not happened yet. Otherwise a good movie. Will not take anything away from the weak 4-ball, but there are a lot of tabs in the film. Oscar nominated for Best Picture? No.",127 Hours
464,terpstra-kevin,A gripping movie from which you will not be able to tear yourself away.,8,13 March 2011,"I saw the Academy-Award-nominated movie ""127 Hours"" the week of March 6, 2011. I limn my take-away here. Some people have described the movie as escapist entertainment. Normally averse to such cheap cinematic productions, I had to have my arm twisted to go. While I expected it to be finger-tappingly dull--or having me climbing the walls after a few minutes, it turned out to be the gripping story of a man whose pursuit of adventure suddenly finds himself in a grave position.When the gravity of his sudden change in environment dawns on him, our protagonist is, at first, laughingly frustrated, but, ... he soon grasps the severity of his situation. Armed only with a cheap knife, some climbing equipment, and the will to succeed, he is hard pressed to figure out his path to freedom; and, like Atlas, the situation weighs heavily upon him. Finally, after running out of water, and having deep doubts, he reaches for a solution, and plumbing the deep recesses of his mind, he realizes that his liberty had been right at his fingertips all along. Extricating himself from his plight will be hard, and the viewer will witness some petrifying moments and excruciating scenes that are so alarmingly vivid you could cut the tension they create with a knife.Wedged between love for himself ... and a second chance, in a series of flashbacks and hallucinations, he comes to a psychological realization and finally makes the lacerating decision to break away from his worldy attachments. These scenes cut a little close to the bone and are nerve fraying, but I'm glad I hung in there, because it was worth it.Some scenes will rock you, and the twists and turns increase the tension scene after scene. Still, the film is disarmingly well made, and severs the ever-present connection between the self--and the goal of the self that is beyond reach. In essence, it is about the separation between the possible and the impossible. The drama is riveting and had me pinned to my seat. It is a wrenching story, from which you will be unable to tear yourself away.I can only count on the fingers of my two hands the movies that I would recommend this heartily. I applaud the filmmakers-- and actor, whose dexterity and hands-on approach, made the film the cutting edge drama that it is.Borrowing the universally recognized hand signals from Siskel & Ebert, I give it two thumbs up.Give up those things that are holding you back from witnessing this work of art; break away from your usual routine; go see this cinematic marvel before it leaves theaters.I would be hard pressed to to recommend a more grounded film.",127 Hours

But the good lesson we learned was ""Always leave a note at home when you go for some adventure"" and also..... Do not watch a movie based on only IMDb rating. I think the reason behind such high rating of this movie is only that its based on some true story and the people who watched it were had so much sympathy for the trapped person that they immediately logged into IMDb and gave it rating above 8 lol.

I actually didn't see the time pass by.You can also feel that he regrets some of the things he has done, with the constant flashbacks that the movie shows us. I am writing a review mostly to say how much I hated the ending ; We all knew he was going to cut his arm eventually and be free but the director should of went deeper in the ending ; Did he ever saw those 2 girls? Who did he marry? Did he tell his kids the story? How much did that change him? I really wish the director wrote a better ending for this movie, but beside that, the pain, the loneliness of the situation I felt them all.

The cinematography was great, the acting was spectacular, very accurate to the book. There was no part that slowed down, and the scene where he cuts off his arm is very realistic.

471,bob-robinson-vc,127 Hours: Being a Loner is Not All That It's Cracked Up to Be,9,4 May 2011,"I remember doing a solo climb up a 14,000 foot mountain in Colorado. Nobody knew I was making the hike except that I signed my name in at the trail head. As I started to head up, I noticed rescue helicopters flying around overhead. I made it to the top of the mountain and came back down safely, but later found out that a climber before me had slipped off a cliff and died. While it is exhilarating to be alone in the great outdoors, enjoying God's amazing creation, it made me realize why they always say it's better to climb with a buddy. Instead of acting like I was invincible, I probably should have called my wife and told her my plans. What is it about being a loner that makes some of us feel more significant? Why do we find pleasure in ""going it alone,"" shunning doing things in community, brushing off relationships as if they are burdens? In 127 Hours, James Franco plays Aron Ralston, who famously became trapped in a Utah canyon for five days when a falling boulder pinned his hand, making him helpless to escape until he boldly cut off his own arm. Ralston is portrayed as a man who acts as if he is a living Mountain Dew commercial, taking off on a Mountain Bike into the depths of Utah canyon country, alone with his only companions, his camcorder and digital camera, to explore and survive what nature has for him. I expected to identify with Ralston's character. I was looking forward to vicariously exploring those canyons with him and experiencing the excitement of figuring out a way to survive on pure cunning. For two hours, I wanted to be that cool loner-guy, the guy that the girls find irresistible because he doesn't need them for a good time. What surprised me is that I am far more like Ralston than I'd like to admit, but not in the ways I expected.What Writer/Director Danny Boyle does with this film is allow us into the inner thoughts of the main character as he discovers his personal flaws through the crisis he faces. He discovers that he has neglected his relationships in favor of a persona that he wants for himself, the man-against-nature guy who doesn't need other people. In a humorous scene, Ralston turns on his camcorder and pretends to be a talk show host interviewing himself. Ralston playing the Talk Show Host: ""Aron, from Loser's Canyon, Utah, how do you know so much?"" Ralston: ""I volunteer for the Rescue Service. You see, I am something of a, uh, well a big @#%@ hard hero, and I can do everything on my own, you see?"" Talk Show Host: ""I do see."" (wink) ""Now, is it true that despite, or maybe because you're a big @#%@ hard hero, you didn't tell anyone where you were going?"" Ralston: ""Uh, yea, that is absolutely correct."" Talk Show Host: ""Anyone?"" Ralston: ""Anyone."" Talk Show Host: ""Oops!"" (grin) Ralston: ""Oops."" (look of dismay)Ralston then goes on to leave a message on the videotape for his parents, confessing that he had not appreciated them like he should have. It is the pivotal moment in the movie. We see in Franco's face the sorrow that he feels, and we are moved. James Franco is amazing in this film, able to convey the inner man of Aron Ralston's emotion—fear, sadness, whimsy, and humor—not only through his interaction with his video camera, but also simply through his facial expressions.Anthony Dod Mantle, who won the Academy Award for Cinematography for Boyle's previous film, Slumdog Millionaire, and Jon Harris, who did the film editing, should have both won Oscars for this film. This movie is basically about a lone guy stuck in a narrow canyon, not exactly the kind of material for an exciting film, but it moves with an almost frenetic pace, perfectly capturing the intensity of the main character's personality. Ralston dreams, has nightmares and hallucinations, and through these we see into the inner workings of Ralston's mind as he reflects on his life—of a failed relationship with a girl, of his growing up with his parents and sister, of his encounter with a couple of hikers on the trail. All these chaotic images create a picture of a man who finally is getting what life is really all about. Brilliant. If you are anything like me, you get caught up in your own private world and agenda far too much, shirking the very relationships that bring vitality to life. It is sad that it is only in those moments of crisis that we finally realize how dear community and family really is. When I personally nearly died five years ago, all I cared about was my family and friends. Five years later, I again take them all for granted. Sad.To be human is to live in relationships. It is part of the warping of our psyche that we believe that we are better off alone. Americans are more socially isolated today than they have ever been, disconnected with others as they seclude themselves from people. We think that being human is being able to go it alone, but in reality, being human is being interconnected with others. We actually become less human the more we scorn relationships. And yet, we are constantly taking our most treasured relationships for granted. An ancient text reads, ""If one falls down, his friend can help him up. But pity the man who falls and has no one to help him up!"" It goes on to say, ""A cord of three strands is not quickly broken."" (Ecclesiastes 4:9-12).There is great wisdom in this. Let us not stop getting together with others in real relationships, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another.",127 Hours
472,nickserpa,James Franco plays a relatable protagonist,7,16 November 2015,"127 Hours is not a movie that I expected to love right off of the bat. While I had heard very positive things about it, I was skeptical--how could James Franco carry an entire narrative on his own? And of course, I had heard about ""that scene"" towards the end of the film (as most people have). I have a pretty high tolerance for gore, but I didn't know if I would be able to watch a man cut his own arm off with a dull knife (especially after learning that several people had fainted during screenings after seeing this particular scene.) 127 hours focuses entirely on the story of Aron Ralston--a 20-30 year-old man with a knack for climbing, mountain biking and the wilderness. He leaves for a weekend trip to a canyon in Utah, without notifying any of his friends or family where he is going. He has a brief run in with some women, and he goes out of his way to take the to a secret underground swimming hole, but once he returns to his trek (by himself,) things go south. He slips into a canyon, and a heavy boulder lands on top of his arm, pinning him against the impenetrable canyon wall. He tries to move the rock, but only ends up making matters worse for himself, and ultimately is faced with a choice--does he let himself die, or risk cutting off his pinned arm in order to free himself? The film does an excellent job setting up Aron's character--he's capable and knowledgeable about what he's doing, but he's also a little too cocky for his own good. At the beginning of the film, and through flashbacks, we see him ignore a few calls from his friends and family. We also see him leave his job at the bike store, and refuse to tell his manager where he will be visiting over the weekend when he asks him. As Aron grows weary from dehydration and exhaustion, his mind begins to wander between his more notable memories and bizarre hallucinations. It is through the former that we are able to see how, in many ways, Aron brought this upon himself. He isolated himself from people who cared about him in lieu of his sport,and while he never comes off as a terrible person, it quickly becomes clear that Aron may have had a chance had he made better choices. There's a dark irony to all of these scenes, and it really hit me hard. Aron realizes, the irony, too. ""Oops,"" he says to himself.The writing is extremely relatable, and James Franco did an amazing job at portraying the alternating (and constantly escalating) emotions of frustration, desperation, and loss of sanity. After the accident, which ends up being where Aron spends the majority of the remainder of the film, Franco doesn't really move much on screen. However, his vivid and varied facial expressions, combined with the dirt in his hair and the way he inhabits Aron's body, really helps to sell the character. In other words, I never felt like I was watching James Franco--I believed that I was watching Aron Ralston. That's remarkably high praise.The cinematography grew on me over time. The jump cuts are a little overused in my opinion, but in certain scenes, they are incredibly effective at conveying Ralston's train of thought. It's pretty impressive the kind of angles that they were able to utilize within the confines of such a small space, which means that the movie nails the feelings of claustrophobia without getting boring. The best shot of the film, in my opinion, is when Ralston screams for help, and the camera flies out of the canyon, revealing just how insignificant Ralston is in comparison with the world around him (literally and figuratively speaking).The film is trippy and discomforting, but it also was relatable. I grimaced, but I also empathized and felt hope for Ralston, and wanted to see him succeed. This film is definitely worth a watch.",127 Hours

Sure, you have to be a man's man to hack off your own arm with a dull knife, but the guy (as portrayed) was a cocky, unlikable idiot who thought he could do no wrong.

476,benf40,Very bad film one hit wonder Danny Boyle,2,23 January 2011,"How this film is getting such good reviews is beyond me but i guess everyone has different views,or people are sheep as they say.Someone like Oliver Stone should of directed this not Boyle,sure Trainspotting is excellent but he got lucky with a great novel/cast.127 hours is so bad it hurts,Aron Ralston deserved so much better.If you read this review i advise you to not watch this film and just watch the documentary 'Desperate Days in Blue John Canyon' 127 hours is so bad in every way it's very amateurish film making but thats what happens when directors have a big hit movie and then are given free reign for their next film,Transformers 2 anyone.",127 Hours
477,yrharvey,Intense and Impressive,9,24 February 2013,"For those who are squeamish, it would be a shame to miss this inspirational movie simply because of its graphical scene towards the end. 127 hours does not only tell you the story of Aron Ralston's journey gone wrong, it almost makes you experience the isolation and emotions that are felt yourself. The beautiful yet eerie Utah scenery and Boyle's camera shots add a lot to the unique feel of the movie. Franco carries the movie almost entirely by himself and delivers a strong and convincing performance, that in my eyes couldn't have been done any better. It seems almost impossible to make a movie about a hiker trapped in the same place for five days without making it boring or long-winded. Danny Boyle's originality and attention to detail prove the opposite and hold your attention for the full 90 minutes. It's so much more than the story suggest, it's not all about a man cutting off his arm. It's about life-or-death, it's about hopelessness and courage. It's an intense and impressive movie that I surely won't forget any time soon.",127 Hours
478,jeremy-upsal,What happened?,2,6 June 2013,"I don't know what happened in this movie. Besides the fact that you already know the story, a guy gets stuck in a canyon and then.. continues to be stuck in the canyon until he gets out. Then, at the end he is a celebrity and everything is cool.I don't know how they managed to spend $18,000,000 on this. Maybe they paid Franco $1 for each word? Nothing happened... waste of time. The only thing at ALL redeeming about this movie is the shots of Moab, of which these are very limited thus rendering the movie... useless. As previously stated.I need another line to complete this review. Fortunately that statement is an impeccable analogy to this entire movie.",127 Hours
479,bethharvey97,"Amazing book, Terrible movie",2,26 August 2013,"Having finished reading the book literally a few minutes ago, it was one of the most amazing books I have ever read, and I've read A LOT. I was feeling really enthusiastic about the story, amazing main character who's smart, funny and an amazing person and a story that really lets you get to know Aron and his life and it makes you feel you're living the ordeal with him. Movie? I got bored half way through and started reading reviews on it. The movie is completely inaccurate to the book, especially with the Kristi and Megan part, they never went swimming... stop making excuses to get people half naked! Non existent script, audio and visual effects way too flashy, I really did not enjoy the movie one bit. And to everyone calling Aron a stupid, arrogant a.hole, he isn't. It's just the way the movie portrays him, 'Aron' annoys me too in the movie.So pretty much to sum my rant up, READ THE BOOK AND DON'T WATCH THE MOVIE. I wasted 90 minutes of my life...",127 Hours
480,zemill,A thrilling survival movie based on a true story!,9,7 August 2014,"I remember when I first saw the poster for this movie a couple of years ago. I had no idea what it was about, but the poster caught my attention. I later discovered that the movie was actually based on a true story, of a man who got stuck with his arm between a rock in the middle of nowhere. He then survived for 127 hours (hence the title of the movie) before he cut his own arm off, and got loose. I didn't actually see the movie 'till only a couple of weeks ago, and man. Did it really excel. The survival elements are excellent, and you can feel the struggle this man is going through. He tries desperately to stay alive and not loose his sanity and by that I mean if he really goes insane , he's done for. James Franco portrays the man who got stuck, the man being Aron Ralston and Franco really delivers. The pacing of the film is also great, which really surprised me. Because it's a movie about a guy who gets stuck in the middle of Grand Canyon, how interesting could that really be? Somehow they kept me on the edge of my seat all throughout the movie, and I'm really happy that I finally saw it after so many years. 127 Hours is one of the best survival movies I have ever seen, period.",127 Hours
481,Ryan183,A movie for the ages.,10,6 February 2011,"Danny Boyle wowed me with Trainspotting and floored me with Slumdog Millionaire. I had high expectations going into 127 Hours. Well simply put, Boyle has exceeded every expectation I had. 127 Hours is by no means a movie for everyone. There is very little dialogue, it kind of reminded me of Cast Away with Tom Hanks. Different circumstances but the need to do anything(and I mean anything!) to survive is present in both films. If you like only movies with explosions or crude jokes this might not be for you. If you want to challenge yourself for 95 minutes then I highly recommend you watch 127 Hours.James Franco is nothing short of brilliant in this role that I hope lands him the Oscar. He truly put his heart and soul into this role. He is an actor on the rise and this role proves it. I really though he was great in Pineapple Express but this role puts him at the top of today's current actors.And of course with any Danny Boyle movie there is the music. I won't give anything away but the final scene in this movie along with the music brought tears in my eyes. It is truly inspirational and something I likely will never forget. In my opinion it ranks as one of greatest 5 minutes to ever end a movie. This movie serves as a metaphor to the challenges we face in life. Stuck, feeling unable to move, we must remember that if we believe and persevere we can accomplish anything life throws at us. I remember coming out the theater, the cold winter air hitting my face and never feeling so alive after a movie ended.",127 Hours
482,miriamsachs,Interesting Use of Cinematography from Anthony Dod Mantle,9,23 October 2016,"The story line of 127 Hours is that a man backpacking alone becomes trapped by a rock in a canyon in Utah, and must figure out how to survive. The movie is mostly visually driven, which makes it interesting to focus on the work of the cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle. Mantle's methods for recording this film make the movie almost experimental.Mantle never holds the same shot for very long. Within seconds, there is camera movement or a change in angle. The camera goes above, below, besides, next to, and pans past characters. Some shots are at unusual angles. There are pan and zoom combinations that move from the landscape to the main character, Aron, and vise versa. Mantle shows off the rock formations with multiple shots so wide, Aron becomes a silhouette. Little time is spent on an average shot of a character's whole face. Instead, Mantle cuts to closeups of hands, feet, eyes, objects, people's shadows, and shots from the characters' point of view. Instead of cutting to each character's face during conversations, the camera moves between characters as if it was another person standing there. Changes in camera angle are also used to subtly cut out unnecessary points in the story without changing the setting. Additionally, there are many frames within a frame, and in these moments, Mantle often shows both sides of the frame. Parts of locations that the camera looks through include cabinets, openings in rocks, tree branches, and a car window while the interior was dim. Mantle also uses the camera to view what the eye would not normally see, like inside a water bottle or Aron's camcorder while a new clip loads.Aron's camcorder becomes another view for the audience to look through as his vlogging occasionally takes up the screen. When Aron takes photos, the scene pauses, and the photo shrinks and slides offscreen. The camcorder also becomes something for Aron to talk in order to include dialogue when no other people are around.The movie has very little dialogue. In fact, almost all the deleted scenes included on a DVD version of the movie were the dialogue driven. One deleted scene has Aron talk about his options, but in the movie, he acts them out or the audience watches what he imagines. While there are points where a little more dialogue would have made a scene easier to understand, dialogue heavy scenes would have distracted the audience from the visual focus of this film. Instead of talking to move the story or give context, the audience is given text to mark the days, music with lyrics, visual hints, and Aron's thoughts and memories. By playing out Aron's thoughts, Mantle is able to take the audience out of the canyon, even though Aron is still trapped there. The memories also bring characters for Aron to interact with. The present Aron sometimes appears on screen with the opacity turned down to make him ghost-like on top of memories or daydreams of life outside cave. Memories further blend with the present when other characters and objects from his memories appear in the cave instead of cutting to another setting or changing opacity. His memories are also projected on Aron's eyes or a cloth he puts over his head at one point.The passage of time in the film also relies on visuals. Natural light is almost always used, and puts an emphasis on how much daylight is left. However, there are some indoor scenes with artificial lights and daydreams with dramatic lighting. The changing color of Aron's lips as he stays in the canyon longer is also a way of showing how much time has gone by. This is probably accomplished through applying makeup before shooting.There are more ways the movement of the camera is used. At times, the camera movement is based on Aron's emotions. There are smooth aerial shots as Aron enthusiastically starts his journey. There are shaky, quick movements as Aron tries to desperately free himself. Intentional temporary blurring and distortion of audio are also used to communicate how Aron feels at points. Pans and zooms are used to focus on smaller parts of a scene and reveal what the audience should be looking at. Mantle does something very unique where he splits the screen into thirds that are longer vertically. Sometimes, there is a horizontal shot that continues as two others pop on top. Other times, all three appear together. The thirds of the screen show different angles of the same scene or different times of day along Aron's journey. There is a point where the left and right thirds were mirror images of each other while the middle was something else. By having clips share the screen, Mantle is able to both be creative and make the story move faster by not showing each clip individually.I would recommend watching this movie to see a very creative and purposeful use of cinematography. The film is also interesting because it is based on a true story. However, I must warn you that it does get unexpectedly gruesome. Don't let the cheerful and comedic opening let you forget this story is about a man struggling to survive. The physical environment drives both the story and visuals, whether due to the sunlight, rock formations, wind, or water. Be prepared for what seems like unneeded shots to foreshadow to events later in the film. While Mantle did a good job at making shots matter, the one negative point I have about the film is in the long part where Aron is trapped, the movie seems a little dragged on. I think the editors should have cut out more of the scenes in the cave and kept some of the expanded ending found in the DVD. While the alternative ending has some great scenes of what happened to Aron later, it proves the saying that the best scenes can hit the cutting room floor.",127 Hours
483,hushdatfuss,don't believe the hype,3,17 January 2011,"this movie is terrible.if you want to see a movie that manages to make a dull situation exciting then go watch ""Buried"". this is a waste of money and time.i am not talking about the experience that this person had in real life but about the the movie that resulted from it. there is absolutely no suspense.the boring flashbacks are pointless because they never give us a feel for who we are dealing with and at no stage does the movie manage to create a true feeling of sympathy for the main protagonist.no emotions come up and the main character seems cold.you never get the feeling that he is afraid or longing for his family and loved ones or that he even has the will to really survive. on top of that the flashbacks are confusing and do nothing to further the plot in any way. the cinematography and soundtrack were the only thing special about this movie and i still feel that it was used way too much to distract from the dullness of the story.merely the last 5min created any kind of excitement in this more than sub par movie. i had high hopes and expectations for this flick but it was a major let down. maybe if you get really high before watching it you can enjoy this.but if u don't smoke up like me you are out of luck",127 Hours
