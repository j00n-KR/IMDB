0,bkoganbing,The Afterlife has its rules,8,11 July 2018,"If there's one thing that What Dreams May Come has is a vivid imagination. Maybe some readings into Dante's Inferno might have given the writers some
ideas as a start. But this goes way beyond.I remember years ago at a Science Fiction convention Peter Davison said that
one nice thing about being the Doctor in Doctor Who was that you could create
your character from scratch. Since we've got no reports on the afterlife one
can the imagination soar in creating it. Soar it does and at times the creation
threatens to overwhelm the cast, but it never does.Robin Williams doctor and Annabella Sciorra artist seen fated to be mated and
are. They raise two children, but both are killed in a car crash devastating the
parents both try to move on. Then Williams is killed in a car crash.At that point the film shifts to the afterlife as Williams starts to get used to the
territory. Cuba Gooding appears as a kind of mentor/guide for him. The place looks like paradise, but paradise will not be complete without the family
reunited.The afterlife does have its rules and Williams has to make quite the journey to
accomplish his goal. Williams, Sciorra, and Gooding give impeccable performances and the sets are just breathtaking.If it isn't this is what heaven should be.",What Dreams May Come
1,SnoopyStyle,interesting vision of afterlife,6,4 January 2016,"Chris Neilson (Robin Williams) is utterly in love with his wife Annie Collins-Nielsen (Annabella Sciorra). They have two boys but they die in a car accident. Later, Chris as a doctor tries to help in a car pile-up and is killed. He is met by Albert Lewis (Cuba Gooding Jr.) in the afterlife. Heaven is made up in his mind with his memories and his wife's paintings. She's connected to him as his soul mate. A despondent Annie commits suicide and goes to a hell of her life gone wrong. Chris goes on a quest to save his wife.There is an interesting afterlife being painted in this movie. It's floaty and in the deepest of colors. It's awe-inspiring at times. It can be a slow journey. It takes an hour before he goes on the quest. He needs to start earlier. His quest into hell is a bit confused. The reveals are not clear enough. It needs to transform the psychological adventure into a more action oriented quest. It is visually interesting but the story isn't.",What Dreams May Come
2,mark.waltz,"Heaven may not be a place on earth, but it is closer to us than hell.",10,12 August 2014,"When motion pictures visit the unknown world of beyond (particularly heaven or hell), there is bound to be controversy. Think of ""Green Pastures"", the classic Broadway play which shows black angels in heaven revisiting the story of the bible, or the tacky ""Goin' to Heaven on a Mule"" sequence from ""Wonder Bar"" where a black-faced Al Jolson goes to the teeny-tiny black heaven, totally overwhelmed by the huge white heaven. There are no black-faced dancers tap-dancing out of watermelons in this touching fantasy which shows that love transcends tragedy and that faith and determination know no bounds when it comes to eternal life.Robin Williams is a husband and father tragically killed in a car accident, and despondent wife Annabella Sciorra commits suicide over her grief. It turns out that their children have died too, and in heaven, Williams is reunited with one of them who indicates that Sciorra has gone to hell. He refuses to live in heaven while she is suffering in hell, so he ventures to the darkest place of the soul in order to rescue her. Assistance from a wise angel (Cuba Gooding Jr.) aids him in getting to the world of Hades, and the horrors he finds are great.Both the beauty and darkness of the soul are explored in this powerful drama which brought out mixed reactions upon its first release. Cynical critics dismissed the film, but the more sensitive and spiritual welcomed it with open arms. The shots of the painting which is heaven are breathtaking to look at, and Williams' joy there is overwhelming. But he's a man on a mission, and once his determination to save his wife becomes his goal, no heaven is big enough to hold him. Hell is a world of unspeakable horrors, and must be seen to be believed. Whether or not you believe in the existence of either place, you can't help but be mesmerized over what happens here. The ending may seem somewhat forced, but truly indicates what the power of forgiveness and redemption means and that is the message that stands out in this most remarkable piece of art.",What Dreams May Come
3,kosmasp,Behind the Horizon,9,30 June 2021,"After Death ... wouldn't it be something if Robin Williams actually went to that place after he died? Of course that is true for all of us ... Let's be clear though, while this is not just about faith (and after life or ""life after Death"" or whatever you want to call it), this will not have a real impact on you if you are cynical about the whole concept. And I can see that happening, because I have that tendency too at times.So no judgement from me, if that is the case for you. Just do not judge those who actually fell and still are falling for this movie ... there is much love, there is much sadness and there is always also hope ... that doesn't mean that all will go well. And while the beginning (of his journey) is quite the trip (no pun intended), the movie does also turn dark and darker ... not all is nice and dandy ... but with that amazing cast assembled you can bet it is done really well. Show me the ... dreams? May be worth than any money, right? And that ending is ... well again, it will depend on how you see things personally ... either perfect or the exact opposite.So many religious believes and thesis are being mixed here ... I personally like that. And I think it is always a nice thought to have something to hold onto ... which of course does not mean you should cut the time short - as the movie indicates anyone who takes their own life will have issues. Which I reckon is a good thing to do, so people are not too enamoured by the overall idea ... you can never be too careful when it comes to the power of movies, can you?",What Dreams May Come
4,lee_eisenberg,Does a great job dealing with death.,7,16 March 2006,"Some people have treated ""What Dreams May Come"" with scorn due to Chris Nielsen's (Robin Williams) affirmations that he can do anything, even if it violates the laws of nature. I beg to differ. The movie shows how he blames himself for his wife Annie's (Annabella Sciorra) suicide, and feels compelled to rectify this.Maybe some people thought that the movie was trying too hard to be like a painting but ended up a series of shots of Robin Williams trying to be emotional. Neither description would do the movie justice. This movie is not all about special effects. I think that it forces us to reconsider our own destinies, and what may become of everything after we die.All in all, a really impressive movie. Also starring Cuba Gooding Jr and Max Von Sydow.",What Dreams May Come
5,jboothmillard,What Dreams May Come,3,13 July 2009,"I did try about twenty minutes of this film once before, but I knew I had to watch the entire film to get a real opinion. Basically Chris Nielsen (Robin Williams) dies after a traffic accident, and goes to heaven more amazing than he could have imagined, guided by good friend (also dead) Albert Lewis (Cuba Gooding Jr.). What makes his heaven amazing is that he is living in the paintings his wife Annie (The Hand That Rocks the Cradle's Annabella Sciorra) has created, so he knows they really are soul-mates. When Albert tells Chris that Annie is also dead, after committing suicide (obviously the pain of his death, and the kids), Chris is determined to bring her to his paradise, even if he goes through hellish world she is now in. With the help of The Tracker (Max Von Sydow), they eventually they reach this world of despair, but Chris cannot let her know who he is, so he pretends to be a neighbour in order to gain her trust, and get her out of this Hell she does not realise she forcing on herself. It should be mentioned in amongst the film are some flashbacks of Chris when he was alive with his wife and his son, but anyway, I can't remember how, but Chris does manage to get Annie out, and they live (dead) happily in their Heaven. Also starring Jessica Brooks Grant as Marie Nielsen, Josh Paddock as Ian Nielsen and Rosalind Chao as Leona. The film may be brightly coloured, and have one or two good effects moments, but the performances are lame, the story isn't very gripping, flashbacks confuse the plot, and I completely agree with the critics, it is sentimental romantic fantasy slush. It won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects (against Armageddon and Mighty Joe Young), and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration. Adequate!",What Dreams May Come
6,ccthemovieman-1,About As Stupid & Insultng As It Gets,1,12 September 2006,"What a disappointment. As someone who loves unique visuals, great color, I was led to believe in previews that the super visual aspect of this movie would be major part of it - that this was going to be like nothing you ever seen! Well, some parts were, but precious few.What dominated, instead, was one of the dumbest stories and theologically- insulting ones to anyone who has any Biblical knowledge I have ever seen. I have should have known Hollywood would invent their own strange and weird version of heaven and hell. It's sad so many ignorant people buy into whatever Hollywood puts up on a big screen as being Truth, when it's usually the opposite they are seeing and hearing. This movie is a perfect example.Suffice to say, without going into all the details, people are using the Lord's name in vain in heaven; God is mentioned only once and that of a ""distant"" person ""somewhere up there"" and the main theology preached is re- incarnation. Secular humanism also is prevalent and in this movie, if you set your mind to it, you can bring your loved ones up from hell to heaven! Wow, who needs Jesus? Not people in the film world, that's for sure.No wonder this film bombed. Even the agnostics and atheists who are our national film critics knew this movie was stupid.",What Dreams May Come
7,moonspinner55,Impossible concoction...,3,20 August 2006,"As a doctor who seeks out his family in a complicated after-life following a car-accident, Robin Williams is perpetually wet-eyed and talks in a simpering voice. Despite an eye-popping spiritual world (with Oscar-winning special-effects), this dreary film is a real downer. There's no driving personality behind the camera--it's all just eye-candy--and the cast fails to provide an interesting anchor. There are no valid emotions, no intriguing plot developments, just a lot of criss-crossing in time (and slack-jawed Annabella Sciorra constantly changing hairstyles). The title comes from Shakespeare, but this lifeless adaptation of Richard Matheson's book is anything but. Not Robin Williams' worst--but certainly in his Bottom Five. *1/2 from ****",What Dreams May Come
8,blanche-2,what a terrible time to see this beautiful film,8,13 December 2014,"Robin Williams stars in ""What Dreams May Come,"" a 1998 film also starring Annabelle Sciorra, Cuba Gooding, Jr., and Max von Sydow.I unfortunately did not get to see this film when it was released in 1998, but I always wanted to see it.Williams plays Dr. Chris Nielson, who is married to his soulmate Annie. They have two children and are very happy until the children die in a car accident. Four years later, Chris himself dies and goes to heaven. There he is reunited with his dog and children, and is guided by an angel (Gooding) who takes the form of an old friend.He then learns that Annie is dead also, and is excited at the prospect of being reunited with her. But it's explained to him that it won't be possible -- Annie has committed suicide and is in Hell -- not the result of judgment against them, but it is their nature to create ""nightmare"" afterlife worlds based on their pain.Determined to find her, Chris leaves the beauty of paradise and searches for Annie to bring her to heaven to be with him and the children. But it's dangerous -- and no one has ever been moved from Hell to Heaven.Gorgeous cinematography and a very moving story, with Williams giving an excellent performance. It's an intriguing script and well directed by Vincent Ward. A beautiful fantasy.Given that one of the main characters commits suicide, I of course thought of Williams' own suicide throughout the film. And it made me miserable. If Heaven and Hell are really like this - and of course, we don't know what lies beyond, this is a story -- I hope someone finds him and brings him to heaven. He had too much humanity, warmth and talent and gave too much joy to the world to be anywhere else.",What Dreams May Come
9,zardoz-13,Tears That Jerk,1,3 July 2008,"In ""What Dreams May Come,"" Robin Williams plays a doctor who dies and goes to Hell. Sitting through New Zealand director Vincent Ward's visually arresting but histrionic New Age allegory about life, death, suicide, and reincarnation is like going to Hell, too. ""What Dreams May Come"" derives its title from William Shakespeare's ""Hamlet,"" but prolific science fiction & fantasy writer Richard Matheson penned the actual novel. No, I haven't perused Matheson's novel, but people have reliably assured me that the movie pales in comparison with its literary source. An earlier and more successful Matheson novel ""Bid Time Return"" became the cult romance classic ""Somewhere in Time"" with Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour.Kiddie friendly pediatrician Chris Nelsen (Robin Williams) and his gifted artist wife Annie (Annabella Sciorra of ""Jungle Fever"") are soul mates. Nothing can separate them! ""Dreams"" repeats this theme ad nauseam so that its ludicrously lackadaisical ending comes as no revelation. Meeting in their youth on a serene lake in Switzerland, they court in the scenic Alps. Life blesses them. Residing in a palatial home, they raise two adorable teenagers, Ian (Josh Paddock) and Marie (Jessica Brooks), along with a rambunctious Dalmatian. Chris enjoys a successful practice as a doctor, while Annie doubles not only as an artist but also as an art gallery curator.During the opening expository scenes, ""Dreams"" bathes audiences in the warm radiance that wreathes the Nielsen home. Predictably, the good times prove ephemeral. Less than twenty minutes into the action, an off-screen auto accident claims the lives of both Ian and Marie. A few scenes later (four years in story time), Chris dies in a spectacular on-screen accident. Initially, Chris refuses to believe that he has kicked the bucket. After all, Chris is walking on Earth as the living do, and he appears none the worse for all his wear and tear. Audiences know better, however, because they see his heavily bandaged body from several high angle shots that suggest his spirit has blown town. Chris eavesdrops on his own funeral. He struggles to console his grief-stricken wife. Eventually, his fuzzy-looking spiritual guide, Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.), convinces Chris that he can do Annie no good by lingering. Every time that Chris achieves a breakthrough with Annie, she collapses in tears and recriminations. Frustrated, Chris gives up the ""Ghost"" routine.Meanwhile, Annie's condition steadily deteriorates. She holds herself responsible for the accidental deaths of both her children and Chris. She let their housekeeper drive Ian and Marie to school the day of their fatal accident because she was too busy with her career. Later, she dispatched Chris to get some paintings for an upcoming gallery exhibit which she couldn't fetch because she was feeling poorly. Colliding with death in a traffic-clogged tunnel, Chris dies playing Good Samaritan to a woman trapped in a wrecked car. After Chris's funeral, Annie considers suicide. Nothing can console her, not even the diary that her therapist has made her compile to deal with her grief and guilt.Veteran scenarist Ronald Bass adapted ""Dreams."" Usually, he knows what constitutes a worthwhile weepie. His impressive credits include ""Waiting to Exhale,"" ""When a Man Loves a Woman,"" and ""How Stella Got Her Groove Back."" Sadly, Bass's skills abandon him in this overblown, love-conquerors-all melodrama riddled with chaos, contrivance, and a conspicuous lack of coherence. Neither Bass nor Ward focuses enough time on the Nielson family as a unit to make them seem sympathetic or charismatic. Cluttered incomprehensibly with flashbacks which come and go in fits and starts, ""Dreams"" generates wholesale confusion. Ward and Bass shuttle audiences incessantly between the present and the past as well as Heaven and Hell. Not only do they weave a tangled tale, but they also play musical chairs with their characters. The characters aren't so much individuals as they are puppets that stand for ideas.Despite all of this rampant confusion, ""Dreams"" conjures up some of the most phantasmagorical imagery that any movie has ever offered. Lenser Eduardo Serra of ""Blood Diamond"" and production designer Eugenio Zanetti of ""Flatliners"" deserve Oscars for their sterling efforts. Even when ""Dreams"" is boring, the LSD scenery is powerful. Hell resembles a conventional synthesis of Dante's ""Inferno"" and the art of Dutch painter Hieronymous Bosch.A miscast Robin Williams does a mediocre Kevin Kline impersonation. Worse, reverting to his usual comic antics, Williams cracks giddy jokes that clash with more than compliment this metaphysical melodrama. Sciorra suffers from a string of bad hair scenes. Williams and Sciorra both play characters that reinforce sexist, one-dimensional stereotypes. Chris braves Hades as the never-say-die husband hero, while Annie epitomizes the hysterical damsel-in-distress. ""Dreams"" represents Sciorra's first role after an absence of some years. Too bad that she chose to grace this poster-art pabulum to stage a comeback.Only mahogany-faced Max Von Sydow of ""Flash Gordon"" emerges with his reputation intact. Cast as 'the Tracker,' he escorts Chris through Hades to find Annie. Sydow wears an outfit that combines Clint Eastwood's Man with No Name with Charon, the ferryman of Greek mythology who steers the dead to Hades over the river Styx. Meanwhile, Cuba Gooding Jr. brings good cheer to a role that qualifies as strictly secondary.""What Dreams May Come"" makes the after-life appear alluring. Admirably, the filmmakers treat suicide as a big no-no. Horribly, they do a soft shoe where morality is concerned. In granting amnesty to Sciorra's suicidal character, ""Dreams"" suggests that life and death are not altogether terminal states of consciousness. The theology of ""Dreams"" stirs Greek mythology, New Age religion, and Judeo-Christian traditions into a thick soup that shouldn't offend anybody except die-hard fundamentalists. Although thematically ambitious and visually spectacular, ""What Dreams May Come"" degenerates into a sluggish, schmaltzy, tear-jerker whose happy ending is hopeless manipulative.",What Dreams May Come
10,anaconda-40658,What Robin Williams Becomes.,7,26 November 2015,"What Dreams May Come (1998): Dir: Vincent Ward / Cast: Robin Williams, Annabella Sciorra, Cuba Gooding Jr., Max Von Sydow, Rosalind Chao: Amazing visual treat about hope. Robin Williams plays a happily married doctor until his son is hit by a car on the way to school. Later, he is killed in a traffic accident and awakens in a world created entirely by paint. Cuba Gooding Jr. enters as an angel who explains that we live in our minds. Williams desires his wife but her recent suicide renders her to Hell. He will venture there to bring her back. Colorful production but not without a sense of doom accompanied by an objectionable view point of Hell. Biblically speaking if someone is in Hell then no one can retrieve them. Director Vincent Ward expands on ideas often with original results but the spiritual elements are warped. Williams does a superb job as a doctor driven by love. Annabella Sciorra is credible as his depressed wife. Unfortunately supporting roles are subdued in their identity as their son. Gooding Jr. never quite rings true due to this plot hole and it is one of the weakest elements of the entire film. Max Von Sydow seems like the compelling choice as a figure in Hell as the role reminds us his Bergman work in The Seventh Seal. Well crafted film about hope and love. We cannot save people from Hell but we can attempt to lead them to Heaven. Score: 7 ½ / 10",What Dreams May Come
11,sddavis63,A Touching Fantasy,5,5 November 2010,"I really liked Robin Williams' performance as Chris Nielsen, a man who dies in a car accident and emerges in ""heaven"" but who then sets out to rescue his wife after he discovers that she has committed suicide and as a result has ended up in ""hell."" Williams was definitely the highlight, and this was most definitely one of the better performances he's offered in a non-comedy role. The fantasy aspect was done well; the portrayals of ""heaven"" and ""hell"" were unique and original enough to be interesting, and the portrayal of ""hell"" was actually quite unsettling and even frightening. The movie is a decent tear-jerker - the whole concept of Chris and his wife being ""soulmates"" was actually very touching, and the movie set that emotional tone right from the stop when Chris's two children are killed in a car accident.For all those strengths, the weakness (and a major one) to this was the overall story. It was touching, but there really wasn't enough meat to it to keep me truly focused on what was happening. It was ""light"" entertainment; the sort of movie one can look away from regularly and then return to for the meaningful parts without really feeling that you've missed much.",What Dreams May Come
12,cherold,pretty but slllllloooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwww,2,23 May 2007,"Perhaps if I'd seen this in the theater the pretty visuals and special effects would have compensated for the tedious drivel passed off as plot, but what a wretched television experience this was.I watched this because I recently read the Visual Effects Society had listed the movie as one of the 50 most influential visual effects movies of all time. (It's an iffy list; apparently the VES membership feels there hasn't been a single influential foreign effects film since the invention of sound, and precious few before then.) On the list there was only one movie I'd never heard of, What Dreams May Come, so I figured I should check it out.Big mistake. There really is no story here; I could probably write a synopsis in two or three sentences; one if I worked really hard on it. Guy dies, goes to new age heaven, people talk a lot, a couple of inconsequential things happen and then there's a stupid, cloying ending. The movie is treacly sentimental, nothing happens for huge stretches of times and the whole thing seems to be just an excuse to wrap some visual effects around a hackneyed story. For the first half of the movie I thought, well, sooner or later the story will actually kick in and there will be some sort of conflict and drama to make this worthwhile. As what passes for conflict and drama do finally kick in though, they were done so poorly and with such draggy pacing that it didn't help at all. I fast forwarded through the second half, pausing now and again to check out the visuals and see if the story ever picked up, but the pathetic dialog and snail's pace continued throughout.Truly wretched. Pretty though.",What Dreams May Come
13,g-bodyl,Solid Dramatic Film!,8,29 August 2012,"What Dreams May Come is a pretty good drama on the issue of heaven and hell. While this movie may be lacking on screenplay, it has very good visual effects. The way heaven and hell was depicted here shows how the visual effects improved from years previously.This film is about a guy who lost his life and is guided by a spirit in the afterlife. When his wife takes her own life, he must save her from being damned for all eternity.The acting is actually pretty good. You often would think Robin Williams as comedy, but he shows he can also do drama. Cuba Gooding Jr also met my expectations as the spirit.Overall, this is a solid film that people may dismiss due to the central themes. I liked it just for the visual effects and the ability to enjoy a movie. I rate this film 8/10.",What Dreams May Come
14,callanvass,"|Slight spoilers| I found it to be often a silly and insulting affair, considering I have vastly different beliefs.",6,24 May 2010,"What Dreams May Come tries so hard to be something so significant, so uplifting and powerful that it almost completely fails. It starts off very well, giving us a sorrowing display of what has happened to the two main central characters, and how the loss of their children has affected them, but then the visual effects completely take over. I won't deny that some of there were awe-inspiring, but it didn't make up for the crummy story that it gave me. I'm not a Christian fanatic, but I am one and I do believe in God, but some of the events taking place here were insulting in my opinion. To say Annabella Sciorra's character Annie has been sent to hell for killing herself, after doing mostly good deeds in her life, I found to be rather a turn off. I really don't believe that's how it all works, killing yourself may be a sin but isn't god about forgiveness as well?. It's not a terrible movie, it's well done, it looks great, but the story is rather inconsistent and lacking for it to fully work, not to mention some of it is overacted.Performances. Robin Williams can be a terrific actor with the right material, but here is let down, and I found him to overdo it at times. There are times where he is completely heartfelt, but sometimes I rolled my eyes at the overacting he did. Cuba Gooding Jr. is good in his supporting role, but I found his role to be rather pointless. Annabella Sciorra is the heart and soul of this movie. Her part is given way to Williams for a lot of the movie, but it's her performance that is the best thing about this movie. Max Von Sydow is OK and acceptable as the tracker, but never anything outstanding.Bottom line. It's not a terrible film, but it's not the movie it aspires to be either. It's let down by the often silly story, and in the end I was never wowed like I should have been. It's worth a look, just don't expect an Oscar quality movie.6/10",What Dreams May Come
15,Bored_Dragon,Two hours for this story simply isn't enough,7,29 September 2017,"Amazing and original idea, beautiful cinematography, good acting, but, in my opinion, story is not developed enough. Just opening part, that prepares us for main plot, could be movie on its own. It may be to much to make series out of this, but there is certainly enough material for at least two movies. They should've developed opening part further until they end up with two parts movie, first part taking place in the world of living and second part about adventures of our main character after he dies. This way, lasting less than two hours, first part is too hasty and sketchy, putting us right into main plot unprepared, without enough background. Potential masterpiece restricted to good, but not great film.7,5/10",What Dreams May Come
16,tabuno,Wow. If Only This Movie Had Been Done When 3D Came Into Its Own,9,17 January 2019,"2 April 2013. Before the action, special effects driven, sci fi thriller Inception (2010) powerhouse, and its more bittersweet contemporary version of the fantasy After Life (1998), there was the cerebral vision of the dramatic romantic fantasy of What Dreams May Come based on Richard Matheson's work, who is also known writings transformed into The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957), The Twilight Zone's episode Nightmare at 20,000 Feet (1963), The Legend of Hell House (1973), even the television version of The Martian Chronicles (1980), the bittersweet Christopher Reeve's classic Somewhere in Time (1980), and later I Am Legend (the 2007) remake of Matheson's 1964 and 1971 versions).Using visual elements to even better effect than Dream Scape (1984) that also starred Max Von Sydow and more surrealistic than the sci fi romantic drama of Brain Storm (1983) and the perhaps inspiring some of the visual as well as relational themes found in both Constantine (2005), The Cell (2000). Echoes of this movie would be later found in the animated fantasies of Coraline (2009), the Japanese animated family classic Spirited Away (2001), family sci fi drama A Wrinkle in Time (2002), The occult horror Silent Hill (2006) and even Anthony Hopkins's Slipstream (2007) and the most recent sci fi relational epic Cloud Atlas (2012).Even though a few of the special effects seem dated, but the surrealistic imaginative vision of an afterlife allows for some slippage. The use of symbolism and even Robin Williams sometimes stylized comedy is mostly restrained to allow the film's character be become its own individualistic persona. The themes of spirited, humor and life as well as the deeds left undone, and the depths of death and sacrifice rarely get as much exposure in one movie such as this. In sum, this is an intense, but emotive and involving movie loaded with dazzling visual and meaningfully emotive appeal.",What Dreams May Come
17,paulclaassen,Brilliant production,6,13 June 2018,"What happens when we die? Don't we all want to know? This is a very vivid telling of what happens, and the place we go to before heaven or hell. The film has some very interesting visuals. As usual, Robin Williams gave an extraordinary performance, in a very different role for him, I might add. Humor, drama and adventure are very effectively intertwined, without any one of them becoming overbearing.The film also touches on a very touchy subject: suicide - especially having lost a friend to suicide not long ago. This surely must be a very difficult film to watch for parents, as well, who have lost a child. The film in its entirety was quite wonderful, actually, with a brilliant production design. I did find the ending a bit too much of a forced happy ending.",What Dreams May Come
18,zkonedog,"Incredible Imagery, Uneven Plot",5,11 March 2017,"A little while back, I watched Jim Carrey's effort to be taken seriously after a slew of comedies, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". This is a similar effort (this time from Robin Williams), but not nearly as intriguing.For a basic plot summary, this film centers on the other-worldly experiences of Chris Nielson (Williams), who dies suddenly in a car wreck. He discovers that the hereafter is whatever his mind makes it, and thus rather peacefully resides within a painting of his wife, Annie (Annabella Sciorra). The only thorn in Nielson's ""ever-after"", though, is the real-world depression (and eventual death) of his wife. Then, when Annie is sent to ""the other place"", Chris begins a quest to save her from her darkest demon: herself.What makes this movie interesting to watch is the fantastic imagery. The visual rendering of heaven and hell are quite stunning, and not something you'll see in any other film. It is filled with color, pizazz, and great imagination.Unfortunately, the plot doesn't nearly measure up to the visual effects. It ultimately takes much too long to reach its zenith, and in between the viewers are left with some uneven emotional moments. Some will make you care and draw you in, while others don't have that desired effect.Overall, this is a decent film, but on that doesn't hold a candle to its nearest cohort (""Eternal Sunshine...""). Watch it for the stunning visuals, but don't expect much more depth.",What Dreams May Come
19,howard.schumann,Like an impressionistic painting,8,17 December 2007,"In Vincent Wards' adaptation of Richard Matheson's novel What Dreams May Come, Robin Williams is Chris, a pediatrician who has a happy relationship with his wife Annie (Annabella Sciorra), a painter, but the sudden loss of their two children in a car accident brings them face to face with loneliness and depression. Annie is hospitalized after a breakdown and when Chris is killed in another car crash in a tunnel reminiscent of the death of Princess Diana, Annie is unable to cope. Soon both are in the next world but due to Annie's suicide, in very different places. Chris' guides in the after realms are Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and Leona (Rosalind Chao), but who they really are is open to question.Chris' mission impossible is to rescue Annie who remains lost in her own little world of sorrow and grief and bring her with him to the heavenly realms. With the aid of a tracker (Max von Sydow), he descends into the depths of hell to search for his long-lost wife. The story suggests that the next world is a sort of wish fulfillment. We are the painters and we design the outcome. You do not have to be stuck with your old identity but can choose the one you want. All you have to do is wish for something and it will appear. Of course, the film is saying that we create our own reality out of our intentions regardless of dimensionality but the message will be lost on most except for those religious partisans who will be upset at the lack of adherence to the Christian orthodoxy.If you've heard that What Dreams May Come can be maudlin, cloying, and manipulative, you have heard correctly, but it can also be very affecting and quite moving with some breathtakingly beautiful cinematography that is reminiscent of an impressionistic painting. The film strongest points are in these scenes that address the best way to communicate with someone who is depressed. When Chris is able to acknowledge that he failed Annie and is able to suffer with her, they reaffirm their bond and truly become soul mates forever.",What Dreams May Come
20,digitalbeachbum,A very interesting movie,8,17 August 2021,"I've had to put down so many dogs that it is difficult for me not to cry thinking about them. The opening scene is terribly reminiscent of those memories. That scene is also the answer to the ending.I believe that this is a more real idea of death than everything that has ever been taught in the history of mankind. I believe that when you die, if your mind is weak you will make your own surroundings. Your mind free of the physical world, is free to go crazy with imagination.

Chris meets an angel played by Cuba Gooding Jr and the rest of the movie has lots and lots of flashbacks. More tragedy follows as Chris' wife (Annabella) commits suicide and enters hell. Its up to Chris to reunite with her again.The visuals are great,story though can be very depressing and leave you scratching your head as again it's got alot of flashbacks.

22,jamesrupert2014,Visually striking but maudlin romantic fantasy,6,6 September 2019,"After a spectacular car accident, Chris Nielsen (Robin Williams) finds himself in a 'personal heaven' in which the idyllic images of his beloved wife's paintings are manifest. His pleasant afterlife is shattered when he finds out that his grief-stricken wife committed suicide and is now imprisoned in a hell of her own making, a grim fate from which he vows to rescue her. The film is visually striking, with a lush palette and imaginative imagery but the story is overly convoluted (unlike the book, people in 'heaven' can appear as anyone they wish) and the ending flat and unsatisfying. I am not a big fan of Robin Williams as a dramatic actor - regardless of the role he seems to be unable to completely suppress the delivery that made him a comedy legend, so his characters always seen artificial and constrained (at least to me). The rest of the cast was fine, but as I didn't find the story very engaging, I quickly lost interest in the characters.",What Dreams May Come
23,freemantle_uk,An afterlife love story,7,26 January 2013,"What Dreams May Come is often described a noble failure, a film that was ambitious and made with good intention but is ultimately faulted. That is a fail assessment of this supernatural film.Chris Nielsen (Robin Williams) and Annie (Annabella Sciorra) are a couple who meet in the lakes of Switzerland and a fall instantly in love. Over the course of their lives they have two children but end dying a car crash. Four years later Chris also dies in a car crash and ends up with heaven in his own perfect world and private universe with guide of a spirit called Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.). As Chris explores this world Annie falls into a deep depression on Earth and kills herself. As a suicide Annie is sent to spend an eternity in Hell and unwilling to accept this Chris journeys to depths of Hell to find her.It is clear there was a lot of ambition put into this film. The most obvious is the visuals, using top of the range CGI for the time, used to great effect to bring to live Chris' version of Heaven. It is clear where Peter Jackson got some of his visual ideas for his adaptation The Lovely Bones as both Chris' Heaven and Susie Salmon's Heaven look very similar and some the visuals and foreshadowing that most films employ. The special effects are even more impressive when you see the scale of the worlds created and that it was special effects used for an art house film.Screenwriter Ronald Bass does attempt to bring in a lot of ideas to the film. He combines different religious ideas and beliefs of the afterlife, of Judo-Christian beliefs of heaven and hell, but also combining it with the idea of redemption, atonement and forgiveness in the afterlife, that people are equal in death. People are also able to be reincarnated, so having either religious beliefs in the mix and God is kept as a distance. Added to this are metaphysical issues about the nature of existence, existing, what happens to people when their die and how they can control and alter the world around them and physical appearance. There is even the idea of person's mental state in the afterlife and how it needs to be in tacked.At its heart What Dreams May Come is a love story, a romance about love in the afterlife and see what a man is willing to do for the woman he loves. Chris embarks on a Dante Inferno's type quest of going into hell to save the person he loves the most. But What Dreams May Come suffers from a being overly sentimental, from the story, the acting and the musical score. This is a film that wanted to tug at our heartstrings as Chris and Annie suffer and when Chris reunites with his children. Ward wanted to milk every moment of emotion he could and unfortunately got the worst side of Williams as a serious actor. What Dreams May Come is an interesting enough film and is does excellent job at showing a Heaven, a task that filmmakers find very difficult to do. It was juxtaposed to creepy screens of Hell, with Hell using practical sets and effects and CGI effects to showcase Heaven. The story is simple but works as a love story in a supernatural setting.Some personal recommendations if you enjoy this film are The Sixth Sense, Inception, The Matrix and The Lovely Bones (both the book and the film).",What Dreams May Come

25,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Gorgeous master work, in my top ten",10,30 August 2015,"What Dreams May Come is my favourite Robin Williams movie, and most likely in my top ten films of all time. It functions on a level of grace and transcendence that's very difficult to achieve in film, but nevertheless, it soars on gossamer wings of unprecedented, jaw dropping creation, steered to unbelievable depths of human emotion and wonder by its special effects, and revelatory lead performances. Usually I'm leery about films that concern the afterlife, and such lofty concepts. This one has a head on its shoulders though, treating it's touchy, very personal insights with a mature outlook. Robin Williams has never been better as Chris Nielsen, a gentle, caring man, deeply in love with his wonderful wife Annie (Annabella Sciorra), and devoted to his children. Sciorra is mesmerizing as Annie, and this is her finest hour as an actress, finding the hurt, the fear and the confusion in Annie as she journeys to the metaphysical abyss. Chris and her have the perfect life, lovely children and a symmetrical, star crossed love that both performers capture splendidly in some lush early scenes that set a tone of harmony. But then, their children are taken from them in a freak car accident. Soon after, Chris is killed in a horrific highway tunnel crash as well (excellently filmed), leaving Annie on her own. Chris discovers that there is no finality in death, and he's guided into the beyond by the spirit of his former friend and doctor ( a lively Cuba Gooding Jr.). They traverse endless astral planes of staggering beauty, from sun dappled river scenes straight out of Botticelli works, to an oil paint stained paradise literally modelled after the works of Impressionism. It's a startlingly phenomenal sequence that leaps right off the screen at you, and it's no wonder it earned an Oscar for visual effects. Eventually Annie, wracked with loneliness and pain, commits suicide, and is sent to a plane eons away from where Chris is, a dark place where souls that take their own life end up. Chris finds out, and is stubbornly driven by love and devotion to find her, despite being told it's impossible. Thus begins a surreal, just incredible odyssey through the nether realms of spiritual void to find her, orchestrated in a believable way that makes you feel as if you're in some far off dream, and not just observing images on a screen. This film isn't about heaven or hell, pleasure or punishment, it's simply about the state of mind we make for ourselves, and how that affects what comes after. There's no god, no Angels, no demons, no religion here. Just a vast, sprawling dream world of abstraction, bits and pieces of our world, reflected through a subconscious prism and thrown out the other side in a dazzling display of endless spiritual realms piled haphazardly among one another, with no rhyme or reason. When Chris does find Annie, we are treated to an ornate, emotionally exhausting sequence, which both of them nail, and is time capsule worthy. This is profound stuff, spun up in gauzy fantasy, but moored in thought provoking concepts of mortality, cause and effect, and what love really means, in this world and the next. It's an extremely ambitious, thoughtful piece with acting, effects and story that go along way, and in my opinion, combine together to make it an endearing classic.",What Dreams May Come

27,TOMNEL,A beautiful looking film with a great musical score don't fully make up for the lack of plot and character development.,7,27 May 2008,"This might be the best looking film I have ever seen. The special effects are phenomenal, the colors are vibrant, and the cinematography is lovely. The musical score, by the late Michael Kamen, is brilliant and emotional, and might actually add to the overall feelings felt for these underdeveloped characters. The plot of this is one that could fit in a 40 page novella and was way too small to make a movie on, and should have been expanded some way.The film starts off and right away we are handed these two characters, Chris (Robin Williams) and Annie (Anabella Sciorra). There is literally no development for these characters, nor is there any substantial introduction to them that would make us care what happens to them. We are handed them, given briefly their character traits. They are both artist types and nice people...we get that right off the bat, but that's not enough to have characters solely built on, but they somehow manage here, and it sort of works. Chris and Annie are soul mates, and they have kids and raise a happy family. Their kids die in a car crash very soon into the film, and 4 years later Chris is killed in another car crash, leaving Annie alone and widowed. Chris lives in his own personal heaven built on the paintings of Annie, and he's followed by his guide, who also was his doctor in life, Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.). Chris is miserable without Annie, and she is miserable being alone, which eventually leads her to suicide, and she is condemned to Hell. Chris realizes he must find and free her. Though this may sound like a big plot, it's not at all. After 20 minutes, all the plot elements are out of the way until Annie's death.The characters have no connection that makes the audience feel they are drawn together. Chris and Annie are soul mates, but why? We never see how they connect, we are just told this through narration and a few scenes of them doing boring things and laughing. The characters end up being more developed in flashbacks throughout the film than anything else, but they don't really develop them that much or show who they are, they just show various events that happened in the past. With that said, I felt genuine emotion for Robin Williams as Chris. One particularly emotional scene, Chris shouts out Annie's name looking over a beautiful pastiche of a mountain, and all he wants is her in his heaven. For people who cry during dramas, this will induce many tears, not necessarily for the characters, but for the situations they are put through.Overall, this is a slow moving, small plotted movie, with characters as flat as day old soda, but the beautiful scenery and musical score almost make up for it. And under it's great looking exterior, is a lovely heart inside, which shows at many times throughout the movie, and might make even the hardest of guys feel just a wee bit sad.My rating: *** out of ****. 112 mins. PG-13 for language.",What Dreams May Come
28,Seraphion,Nice plot and revelations,8,22 September 2014,"The movie's story opens up quite softly in all so abstract auras with all those scenery. It builds the first and second base conflicts right away. The main conflict is built just shortly after the introduction of the rules of the heaven world. The revelations of the characters in heaven, all three of them, are quite unpredictable. Even with the basic rules laid down that there are basically no rules in heaven, it's hard to predict those revelations because of the lack of introduction to the persona the characters chose to be in heaven. The depiction of the hell is just outright scary in its own way. With less fiery scenes, the hell depiction can still get scary, both technically using the right positioning of the screaming voices, and symbolically by using the Virgil representative, the scary drowning souls and the buried faces scenes. I see the possible origins of other stories here such as Ghost and Wristcutters. The acting part is really nice overall. Robin Williams did his expressions very nicely, taking the viewers to delve deep into the character's emotions. Cuba Gooding Jr. did nicely in balancing the story part where the lost soul needs guidance. Max Von Sydow played the Virgil representative wise man nicely, doing the strict advises strongly.",What Dreams May Come
29,aimless-46,"More Comforting View of Afterlife Than ""Silent Hill"" But Not As Fun",6,9 May 2006,"''What Dreams May Come,'' is what would have happened if Cecil B. DeMille had produced ""The Wizard of Oz"" and been able to utilize digital effects. DeMille had hit on a successful formula, produce biblical/religious epics and fill them with erotic images and sexy stars. There are no erotic images or sexy stars in ""What Dreams May Come"", which instead combines a user-friendly visualization of the afterlife coupled with a special effects bonanza- but the idea is pure DeMille in its effort to widen the target audience by providing something essential to just about everyone.Directed by Vincent Ward and complete with a pretentious Shakespearian title (from Hamlet's contemplations of suicide), it would seem like a package Mr. DeMille could only dream about. Yet the $85 million ""What Dreams May Come"" did not enjoy the box office success of a DeMille epic.Loosely adapted from the Richard Matheson novel the basic premise lacks the originality of his ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"". Rather it is a retelling of the Greek fable of Orpheus and his unsuccessful attempt efforts to rescue his lover from Hades. Which is an extremely downbeat story of loss and sacrifice. Although the film is ultimately more upbeat it remains a quest story including an exploration of the underworld by someone who does not belong there. While the digital effects are rather ordinary by today's standards the film's message is still comforting to many viewers. The score is the film's best feature and I frequently found it quite moving. Unfortunately, at 113 minutes the film would benefit from some trimming. The allegorical elements about communication between the living and the dead are especially drawn out, as are the pre-death segments which exist only to demonstrate that Chris Nielsen (Robin Williams) is a selfless physician and extremely good person who deeply loves his wife Annie (Annabella Sciorra), a painter and art restorer.She loses, in quick succession, her two children in one automobile accident and Chris in another. Chris is transported to heaven with Cuba Gooding Jr. as his guide. The emotional range of this film is simplistic, and Williams alternates between elevated grief and awed wonder. Often he is fighting back tears or putting on pained smiles. After a half hour on earth and another half hour in heaven you begin to crave some drama or suspense. When the drama starts (there is never much suspense) it is best that you share at least some of afterlife visualizations being expressed by the film. Otherwise you will be underwhelmed.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",What Dreams May Come

31,mike48128,Most Unusual Depiction of Purgatory-Sad but Wonderful!,8,12 August 2014,"Leonard Maltin hates this film and called it a ""bomb""! I obviously disagree. Somewhat hard-to-follow in spots. An unusual visualization of Heaven, Purgatory, and Hell. Dr.Chis Neilsen (Robin Williams) dies in a freak auto accident and grief-stricken wife Annie, commits suicide four years later because her husband and children are gone. He is in Heaven, she is in Purgatory, and has to step over an eternal sea of ""lost souls"" to get to her. Her Purgatory traps her in her own little house much like it was on Earth, only very badly in need of repair. His journey reminds me of Hades from ancient mythology and ""Dante's Inferno"". The special effects are so rich (beautiful at first) and nightmarish that it is almost a horror film. Great ending, although a bit ""forced"". The alternate ending, (on the DVD) showing live birth, seems ""truer"" to the story, but really isn't satisfying. In Heaven you meet your dog and everyone you should, but they all look different! A well deserved ""Oscar"" for special effects. It should have won for the brilliant screenplay (By Richard Matheson) as well. One of Robin Williams most unusual and non-comedic roles, a very sad movie for the most part, but stay with it. It is rewarding at the end. Very ironic, as yesterday, (Aug. 11, 2014), Robin Williams died by his own hand, at age 63. He will be missed. An extremely talented and beloved man.",What Dreams May Come

33,brchthethird,A visually rich but thinly scripted spiritual odyssey,6,13 November 2014,"WHAT DREAMS MAY COME is a visual feast (especially for 1998) that explores some weighty themes, but ultimately feels artificial and thinly painted. Robin Williams is Chris Nielsen, a doctor who suffers a great tragedy and ultimately is taken by fate as well. While in the afterlife, he goes on a journey to reunite himself with his wife. First of all, let me say that I don't subscribe to a belief in an afterlife, but the fact that the movie treats it as an objective thing wasn't really a problem for me. What was a problem was that the whole story was set up so quickly that the core relationship you're supposed to care about wasn't believable. Sure, the screenwriter covered themselves by having Chris and his wife (Annabella Sciorra) be ""soulmates,"" but this felt like a cop-out from actually doing some character development and building a believable relationship. However, the sentiment expressed by Chris' journey is an understandable one. It tells the story of a man who literally goes to hell and back just to be with the one he loves. Aside from that, the best part of the movie is the visual flair with which the afterlife is realized. One of Chris' passions is painting, and his early experiences there are very much painting-like. This film won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects in 1999, and from what I could tell, it was definitely deserved. The effects weren't necessarily realistic, but they were impressionistic and artistic. On the downside, the metaphysical content and ideas are practically shoved down the viewers throats. There are many conversations laden with language that's supposed to sound like it's important, but the story never really lives up to these lofty ideas. Also, when you create a fantasy world there are often rules established to that everything isn't pure chaos. Here, there are some rules established but the film doesn't stick to them. At times, it's unclear how the afterlife works, which could be confusing to some people (assuming they even believe in such a thing). Overall, this is a very spiritual film that aspires to greatness, but is only OK. Robin Williams and the rest of the cast give excellent performances, but the visuals only serve to paint over the cracks in the story.",What Dreams May Come

35,gkeith_1,"RIP Richard Matheson 06/2013, author.",10,7 April 2014,"The good: Beautiful, lush scenes in Heaven. Wonderful Victorian-era people walking and flying around. Amazing. Chris' afterlife is certainly 'heavenly'. His wife in her 'Prince Valiant' hairstyle. I liked the wedding scene when they retrogressed in the scenes back and forth crossing over her mental illness situation. Another rather time travel movie from Richard Matheson. This is in the afterlife, the hereafter, whereas in 'Somewhere in Time' the protagonist goes backward in time yet at the end he meets his lady love way in the future -- also the afterlife. Even so, Robin Williams and Christopher Reeve were good friends in real life. More good: Annabella Sciorra is very pretty, as are most Italians IMO.The wonderful: Cuba Gooding, Jr. This was a very intelligent acting job. He is Chris' guide through Heaven, and when he (Gooding) becomes Chris' son this is another excellent and smooth acting twist. This part is heart-wrenching. It is good that Chris had all the reunions. Von Sydow is excellent. I remember him as the cruel minister/missionary (husband of character played by Julie Andrews) in the movie 'Hawaii'.The bad: No comedy here. No 'Mork from Ork'. No red clown nose here. No Peter Panning of 'Hook'. No wise-cracking DJ from 'Good Morning, Vietnam'. Robin Williams is truly versatile.The scary and spooky: the scenes in Hell. The Victorians wear black clothes and hats here. They push black baby carriages. It is all so gloomy. In another Hell environment, Chris steps over the dead (yet lively) heads and faces. Ugh. This is scary enough to be almost believable -- quite creepy.Richard Matheson wrote for 'The Twilight Zone'. He wrote 'The Incredible Shrinking Man', 'I Am Legend', 'What Dreams May Come', 'Somewhere In Time/Bid Time Return', 'The Legend of Hell House', plus other original works. He was very good at romantic science fiction, witness 'Somewhere in Time'.Some of his other-worldly stories must have been quite difficult to film. In the Heaven scenes from 'What Dreams May Come', I think that the people flying look a little hokey. This is not a really old movie where the flying scenes looked really terrible and contrived; I expected better -- and these after-death flying heavenly beings looked rather funny the way that their legs curled up behind them. This reminds me of those 1930s anthropomorphic dog movies where the animals were forced to stand up being pulled by strings and ropes. These dogs walked and talked, and human talking and dog sounds were recorded. Some dogs were beer-guzzling alcoholics. The dogs wore miniature human clothes, hats, etc. They were involved in human stereotypical situations, such as spousal triangular murder for adultery, etc. Some dogs smoked cigars and walked with canes.10/10",What Dreams May Come
36,rainking_es,Robin Williams' Trademark,2,30 March 2005,"Pretentious, moralist, demagogic, sickly sweet... Well, I could go on with the adjective-list but there's no reason for. It is a Robin Williams' movie, that's anything you need to know (ok, he's made some good films -Fisher King, Awakenings-, but he usually plays good-guy characters: the good professor, the good psychiatrist, the good doctor...). This time he's a man with a so goddamn happy family who suffer the biggest of the tragedies: the death of their two sons... From that moment on we leave this world and take a trip to the other one. Yeah, we break on through to the other side, but we don't find Morrison or Hendrix, we find what the writer thinks that heaven is (or the hell, or the land of the dead) ... But God knows I don't need none film to tell me how must I behave to get to heaven. (Like Fernando Fernán Gómez's character in ""La Lengua De Las mariposas"" said to his young pupil: the heaven and the hell they all talk about, they don't really exist. The heaven and the hell is inside me and you. The heaven and the hell are in this earth of us.) Jesus, I hate that kind of dogmatic rubbish.PD: According to the story if you commit suicide you'll go to a very very very bad place...

I was bowled over by the story and the colours of the paintings - very very vibrant.Robin Williams plays a man with a perfect personal life. Sadly, his two children die in an accident, and he dies in a car crash and with the help of a custodian angel (played well by Cuba Gooding jr.) travels in a long trek between Heaven and Hell through his wife's paintings, and along the way he discovers some experiences and a tracker (Max Von Sydow) that helps him in the quest for his wife (that ended in Hell after suicide). I won't spoil the end... just see the film by yourself and have a treat!Everything in this movie is great: Williams' performance is majestic beyond words, as a man that after death searches his beloved wife, and also Gooding jr and Von Sydow were great in their roles. The colours of the paintings were very vibrant (a visual eye candy for art lovers like me), and the soundtrack was also good.Overall, nearly a masterpiece and one of Robin Williams' best movies ever!

It has the same effect as one of those friends sitting next to you looking at your face at every surprise. Did you see you coming? Huh? Huh?

Having said that Robin Williams and Annabella Sciorra are under-appreciated actors who play their parts well, even though Sciorra is made to look ugly with bad haircuts and frumpy clothing.

Some critics I've learned from gave this one a fair beating for its simple-minded plot involving reincarnation and flashbacks. While these predictable things are actually correct in truth or opinion, it goes deeper into what this movie stands for: love, sympathy, remembrance, emotion, and sorrow. They're all taken into a world (or two) of fantasy, but be left with the sacrifice of leaving whatever possessions we once had. It even gives a clearer view of our wishes that may hopefully come true in reality, just similar to Robin Williams' deep thoughts. Now I certainly have not had a great amount of cheer through any of his recent material like JACK, but this movie is a welcome change of pace to transform himself into a dramatic actor (and he has been before). Through his dialogue, he remains a comedy-driven guy, and here, he takes control of a finer film role. As it is heartfelt and joyous, it's kind of a difficult path to follow, which may have frustrated some viewers. Still, the surrealistic fantasy can surpass the sudden height of our emotions, and it succeeds as an adventurous journey in search of loss and love, making this film a mild surprise to behold.",What Dreams May Come

They were meant for each other, sharing everything in common, literally making them soul mates. When they got married and had children together, they seemingly had it all--until something drastic happened.Intrigued? So was I, at least near this point in the film. This is where Chris and Annie's children die in a tragic car accident. Then, as if this family was fated to doom, several years latter, Chris himself dies in a rather bizarre incidence trying to save a life. From this point on, the movie's script begins a roller coaster ride of ups and downs.After his death, Chris enters the afterlife of his own personal heaven; an unbelievably gorgeous place where everything in existence is composed of elements featured in his number one pastime, art. The visual atmosphere seen here is absolutely breathtaking in every way.There is the subject of hope presented to the audience as this film's overall message . I say the word ""subject"" because ""element"" or ""spirit"" would make it sound as if we are able to become involved in this emotional story. And we can't. That's too bad because the film has some strong power in its depth. A plot twist accumulates, however, when Chris detects that his wife, suppressed in depression and sorrow, has committed suicide and is banished to hell for her actions. Devastated, Chris defies the rules and seeks her out in the horrible territory Annie has gotten herself into. It is here where director Vincent Ward takes us into a stunning world of depraved loneliness, in which we set our sights upon numerous horrifying and imaginative things. Some of which are quite disturbing, and border a high MPAA rating. The features an overly long program length which is used to desperately try to hide the fact that there isn't any character development with bombarding us with flashbacks. Well, if the filmmakers would have taken a different approach at the character's history, lets say, putting the scenes in chronological order, instead of using flashbacks, which are bizarre and confusing, they may have had something with this material.

It felt longer than it should, so I didn't love it for that reason. I don't hate long movies or anything (and this one wasn't THAT long), but the pacing was just a little bit off. Recommend to Robin Williams fans.",What Dreams May Come
43,Al_The_Strange,What Dreams May Come review,7,22 July 2013,"It's strange to me that there just aren't that many films that actually show Heaven or Hell in great depth. Perhaps because of that, I often look upon What Dreams May Come as the closest we have to seeing the afterlife on a grandiose Dante-esque scale. The film's biggest selling point are its special effects, which bring Heaven and hell to life in an extremely vivid fashion. Scenes in heaven start off as a literal painting, which is stylish and whimsical; every other scene is ordained with beautifully lush and sunny landscapes and architecture. Later on, the film shows a fantastic cityscape with magnificent domes, arches, spires, with flying people and waterfalls all around it. Then, when the characters make their epic journey to Hell, they tread upon freakish landscapes ordained with shipwrecks, heads in the ground, and a sea of bodies. Scenes like these are brilliant and lovely, for they appear like living, moving Renaissance paintings.However, the experience of What Dreams May Come is a strangely uneven one. The film's narrative is cut up, interjecting flashbacks and dialogue at odd places. In doing so, the pacing becomes herky-jerky. The film will be drop-dead serious one moment, sentimental the next, then slappy, then corny, then beautiful, and so on. It also takes a little while to get to the good stuff; the actual plot of the movie doesn't kick in until ten minutes or so, during which time nothing much really happens. I think if the entire film was focused on the afterlife, rather than jumping back and forth and focusing so much on the characters' sentimentality, it would have been more effective. As it is, the film is strangely uneven.The story generally works, but thanks to the way it's broken up, I feel the plot suffers tremendously. Conflict is slight as it is, but with the frequent flashbacks and interruptions, the plot stalls most of the time. When the plot does take momentum, it covers rather predictable ground. Characters are generally likable and emotional, and are a pleasure to watch.A few concepts are challenging though: the film takes the safe path through its theology, with its mention of reincarnation, with having certain characters take on the attributes of different races and creeds rather than being themselves. The film is also very Swedenborgian, given its assertions about love, punishment in the afterlife (or rather, the lack thereof), and the notion that Heaven and Hell are derived from the characters' minds or the state of their soul, rather than being real places. The film portrays an afterlife that's non-threatening and all-encompassing, which is nice, but runs contrary to established beliefs in theology and religion. At its worst, it's pure Hollywood sugar-coating.The film generally looks good, with a varied mix of interesting photography and vivid imagery. Editing is pretty wonky, given the way it cuts up different scenes in one giant meatloaf-style narrative. Acting is decent though: Robin Williams eeks out a few of his signature silly lines, but other times he's really earnest. Cuba Gooding Jr.'s presence is somewhat bewildering, but he seems to have fun with his role. Max Von Sydow comes off as a Virgil wannabe, and Annabella Sciorra nails her role. Writing is a mixed bag; it's sophisticated in some places, simplistic in others, and really sentimental throughout. This production has magnificent sets, props, costumes, special effects, and locales. Music is nice too.The story's pretty random, and some of the ideas seem to be watered-down for mass audiences, but What Dreams May Come does offer a worthwhile experience, as it literally paints visions of the afterlife before our eyes. At the moment, it's the best we have to actually seeing what Heaven and Hell could look like, and that alone makes it worth seeing at least once.3.5/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Average | Film: Pretty Good)",What Dreams May Come
44,chrisbrown6453,I just couldn't get enough of What Dreams May Come.,7,19 June 2002,"It was a moving, visually stunning masterpiece unlike anything I'd ever seen before. Even though I knew how it was going to end, I kept cheering for it to happen. An absolutely beautiful film. Chris (Robin Williams) and Annie (Annabella Sciorra) are husband and wife. They met by chance and fell in love immediately. They have two wonderful kids and a marriage full of love and life. But tragically, one day their kids are taken from them in a car accident. They fight to continue their lives, but one day, four years later, Chris's life is also taken. He ends up in Heaven, but can't accept his fate. A guide is sent to him, in the form of his friend Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.). Albert leads Chris on a journey through Heaven, and the wonders it can bring. In the real world, Annie can't handle Chris's death, and she kills herself and ends up in Hell. Chris must go on a journey to find her, and save her from an eternity of sorrow.
This movie hits all the right chords. It makes you laugh at times, and makes you cry at times. The love Chris has for Annie is stronger than anything you have ever seen. He's willing to lose his mind, and spend all eternity in Hell with her, with neither of them recognizing the other, because they are soul mates, destined to be together for all time. This movie is hard to explain in any other way. The journey Chris goes through is remarkable, but the real star of this film is the visuals. When Chris goes to Heaven, he is told that what he sees is what his mind can create. So what he sees is himself inside Annie's paintings. He lives in a Heaven full of brilliant colors. Life in a painting. It was amazing to look at. And the colors of the movie, along with the set designs were incredible. His house, Annie's Hell, the sea of Faces. I just couldn't believe how fantastic everything looked in this movie. The performances were wonderful. Robin Williams was at his dramatic best, and Cuba Gooding Jr. brought energy to the film. The story was strong, if predictable, and the manner is which it was made (utilizing flashbacks) was powerful. You really felt the characters emotions throughout. I know this review is weak, but I really don't know what else to say. I guess you're going to have to see for yourself. It doesn't matter if you don't believe in a Heaven or a Hell. What Dreams May Come will make you believe in something even more powerful than that. Love, and what one man will do because of it.",What Dreams May Come
45,AvidClimber,What Dreams May Come — Hopelessly utopic romance in a fantastical version of heaven and hell,8,27 February 2013,"What Dreams May Come is an incredible take on life after death mixed with the subject of soul mates.Robin Williams, Cuba Gooding Jr., and Annabella Sciorra all give good performances. The same can be said of Max von Sydow and Rosalind Chao in their more minor roles. The designs and cinematography are powerful and beautiful. The story is captivating and the intrigue well integrated. Overall, it's excellent.Now, beside some slightly aging CG, the main problem of this picture is that it's pushing two ideas that are detrimental to our life. One, is the concept of soul mates, that love conquers all, which can lead romantics to stay in relationship that are not good for them. Second, is the idea of the perfect life after death, which robs any purpose out of life. However, those are my opinions and do not diminish the quality of the movie.It's very emotional entertainment. It's a must for romance lovers.",What Dreams May Come
46,blackmamba99971,What possibilities there are,10,5 January 2011,"This was a great film for its portrayal of what it is to go to the afterlife. Robin Williams was brilliant as the unsure soul of his surroundings after death. And before his time was up, he had to go through his children's sudden deaths from a bad car accident, which left him self and his wife in a kind of living limbo where choices they make no longer are an issue. Yet after his death, his wife commits suicide in order for her to see her children and her husband again. Yet as with all conscious choices, hers led to a more distant revelation where she did not recognize her husband even when he arrives to bring her back from purgatory. This was a beautiful example of how connections no matter how strange they may seem, always lead back to the source of how a persons life started. Wonderful sceneries of landscapes and glorious backdrops of surreal beauty. This movie is as warm and heart touching as it is fantasy, Annabelle Sciorria was brilliant as the troubled wife to Robin's character, and Max Von Sydow, his role is as always was flawless. And not to forget Cuba Gooding Junior, the missionary helper to Robin in his quest to find his children and wife. Though Cuba's role was Robin's son. Plus his daughter who helped him in the form of a beautiful Asian woman. An accomplishment in scope, soundtrack, choreography, and artistry.",What Dreams May Come

First both their children die in a car accident, then he is killed by a car, finally she is so desperate that she kills herself. This movie tells the story of how these four dead people find each other again in the next world.Have you ever heard of such a stupid plot? I saw `What Dreams May Come' on television yesterday, and quite soon I was reminded of Tarsem Singh's `The Cell'. A great storm of nonsense comes over us, covered with beautiful colours in absolutely dream-like settings. But the big difference is the following: Singh's film lacks any effort to appear serious to anybody.  It could be a video-clip. This movie wants us to cry with these people who this utterly sad things are happening to. That's why they give us Robin Williams's famous agonized face expression, and they give us terribly touching one-liners such as: `Don't give up!'I don't think the film industry has ever spent so much money and so much technical effort for such utter rubbish.",What Dreams May Come

While he is receiving guidance in the afterlife (heaven?) from a fellow soul (Cuba Gooding Jr), he learns that his wife (Annabella Sciorra) has committed suicide and therefore been delivered to the less pleasant afterlife (hell?). This brings about a Dante inspired decent in order to reunite our protagonist with his soulmate.The visuals are incredible and the story is a nice if simple tale about a pop culture inspired afterlife. We get very good consistent performances from the principles, but none of the performances really standout except maybe for Sciorra.",What Dreams May Come
52,disinterested_spectator,Love Life or Go to Hell,5,17 December 2014,"According to traditional Christianity, people who commit suicide go to Hell, and New Age philosophy is apparently in agreement on this point, if the movie ""What Dreams May Come"" is any indication. In this movie, people do not go to Hell because they are evil, but because they got confused and committed suicide. When Annie kills herself, she is trapped in Hell by her confusion. Her husband Chris manages to rescue her, but all the other suicides remain in Hell for eternity. Too bad for them.Anyway, Chris and Annie make it to Heaven where they are safe. But Chris suggests that they be reincarnated so that they can experience life again. Of course, that means taking a chance of becoming confused, committing suicide, and going to Hell, with little likelihood of there being another rescue. Who in his right mind would chance it? But the idea is that life is so wonderful that it is even better than Heaven, even worth the risk of committing suicide and being eternally damned.Of course, that wonderful life involves such things as having your children die in a car accident, having the marriage deteriorate to the point of almost getting a divorce, and then having a husband die in an accident. Who wouldn't want the chance to experience something like that again? Who wouldn't forgo Heaven and risk Hell to experience such misery and suffering once more?",What Dreams May Come

I t somewhat resembles the movie ""In Dreams"". Its a good concept, but far too hopeless to enjoy.Acting, directing and critical merits are all satisfactory but nothing too great. Robin Williams can't carry the films lead in this situation. He was very good in movies such as Insomnia and Mrs. Doubtfire but this is an exception. Oscar winner Cuba Googing Jr, The Exorcist's Max von Sydow and Anabella Sciorra aren't much to write home about either.Yes, the film has a happy ending, but doesn't make up for the misery and disturbing images which preceeded beforehand.

I absolutely love this movie - it's in my top ten (or maybe even top five) list of favorite movies (I saw it at least 3 times in the theater and own it on DVD).  I have to admit, I'm one of those non- (almost anti-) elitist, ""I don't know art, but I know what I like"" type people.  I also truly love positive, upbeat movies with happy endings.  Not to say that ""realistic"" movies aren't also great, but there is room for everything in the moviemaking genre.  Isn't there enough depressing ""realism"" on the evening news to satisfy even the most jaded cynic?I can't say exactly what it is that strikes me about this movie.  The incredible color-saturated visuals and special effects certainly help.  The acting talents of Robin Williams and Max Von Sydow help.   And I loved the story.  Emotionally manipulative it may be, but this is one of those films where I WANTED to be manipulated, where I willingly participated. Apparently some people resented it, but I was sobbing through much the movie, and glad to be doing so.  Laugh if you please, say whatever you want... this movie touches my heart.""Deep"" it isn't, not terribly.  On a metaphysical level, it goes only slightly beyond new-age kitsch.  Very few of the afterlife scenes and concepts agree with the spiritual outlook of any known religion.  But I don't care.

57,fimimix,"..if Heaven looks like that, take me there..",10,19 June 2008,"As many users comment, this movie will become a classic, and deserves a much higher rating that a ""10"" can convey.Director Vincent Ward (director) certainly was dedicated to directing Richard Matheson's and Ronald Bass' script. Who really knows what Heaven and Hell look like? However, these are fairly acceptable images to more people than I. The cinematography in ""What Dreams May Come"" is exquisite; the usage of brilliant blues, to me, gives the viewer hope. The score was certainly appropriate for whatever was happening on-screen. I always look at the credits to see how many ""stunts"" were used. This film has hundreds - the sheer number of behind-the-scenes crew is staggering. One wonders if that cost were ever recuperated.Robin Williams (""Chris Nielsen"") was stellar in his interpretation and gave an awe-inspiring performance. Every nuance was appropriate, from sadness to happiness. His portrayal of his character was beautiful and inspiring in that it showed he was willing to stay in Hell forever, just to be with his beloved wife. The scene of his telling her he wanted a divorce - and her reaction - was heartbreaking, and certainly provides their decision to be reborn.Cuba Gooding, Jr (""Albert Lewis"", ""Josh Paddock"") was wonderful in his role as angel-son. Gooding always is a marvel in the roles he chooses and certainly scored in this film. Annabella Sciorra (""Annie Nielsen"") was superb; her eyes conveyed every emotion convincingly. Max von Sydow (""The Tracker"") was frightening, but willing to show ""Chris"" the way to Hell. The sets in this episode were astounding, but dread through-out but also with touches of hope with a little blue. Rosalind Chao (""Leona"") gave another stunning performance....one could see that she was ""Marie Nielsen"" (Jessia Brooks Nelson and felt ""Chris'"" heartbreak.Although the film is long, the viewer is drawn-into it. As many have written, don't be afraid to become consumed by this movie. You have to witness and participate to really understand and enjoy it. I don't think I'd like to see the different ending presented on DVD - the film is perfect as I saw it. Bravo!-brava! to all, even the least contributor to this astounding movie.

I never had any emotional investment because I never got to know anyone. I thought Marie was a boy because of her haircut! If you're going to make a film on something this profound, we MUST connect to what's going on. Otherwise, what's the point?Chris and Annie are much more concerned with each other than the children. Yet, notice how easily he ""lets go"" when she visits his grave (and she never visits the kids)? And what doctor recommends a patient takes up smoking?! See what I mean about Bass's lack of development?Heaven and Hell are nothing as they're described in the Bible. That God is dismissed with a vague ""He's up there"" blurb should be enough to send Christians into a collective tizzy! And if Time no longer exists, then why is there Day and Night?I guess it all depends on how one sees things, since none of us knows for sure what happens after we leave this mortal coil.

I will always remember Williams as an actor more suited to comedy or comedy-drama rather than a romance-drama. Though I like the story, I still find it hard to sit through almost 3 hours as a man travels through life, heaven and hell to find his wife. The saving grace were the stunning landscape images, rich lush colors like the portraits they're painted on; solid acting from the main actors - Williams and Gooding Jr; and a story, which though occasionally sidetracks through lots of sub-plots, still manage to maintain the thread that keeps you watching.",What Dreams May Come

64,gcsman,A hyper-romantic visual fantasy -- and one that sticks in the mind,7,23 May 2021,"What Dreams May Come is from way back in 1998, but in a sense I think it had already missed its era: movies this romantic in both the person-to-person sense and the storyline sense, were more typical of earlier decades that weren't quite so cynical and disillusioned as today. For any kind of comparison film involving true love and navigation of the afterlife, I'd think of Heaven Can Wait (the lovely 1978 version with Warren Beatty and Julie Christie), but WDMC has much darker elements to deal with. For sheer emotional intensity, a fantasy setting, and its concentration on a singular tragic love story, I also think of Ladyhawke (1985, with Michelle Pfeiffer and Rutger Hauer).To put first things first, this is a visual feast. If you haven't seen it, get ready for a riot of incredibly imaginative big-scale fantasy scenes with the color dial turned up to 11. There is no unifying feel to them, and that is exactly the point if Heaven allows you to make your own version of it. There's a Dante-esque Hell too -- at least, a couple of circles of it -- but at a strongly individual level, which is also part of the point. The plot is ultimately an intimate, very private story about Chris Nielsen (Robin Williams) and wife Annie (Annabella Sciorra, than whom there can scarcely be anyone more beauteous), a couple who suffer the loss of everything that counts and must find their way back along a road that few, it turns out, have ever travelled. Supporting players are Cuba Gooding Jr, Max Von Sydow, and Rosalind Chao. Everyone is about as good as they need to be given that the storyline and the visuals are kind of the main deal. In the end I can't avoid thinking that Robin Williams, good as he was, was a bit miscast: he was such a gifted, unique comedian that you bring too many of those expectations to watching him.The great film reviewer Roger Ebert said that the ending was a bit of a retreat into conventionality. Maybe. But right up till then this movie, with all its rough edges and rather messy structure, carries a raw power that sticks in the mind. It's a film that you'll remember for a long time.",What Dreams May Come

I have nothing against magic or change in movies, but it has to be to some purpose or effect.  In this movie, all you're seeing are the boring fantasies of the writing team.

66,Barky44,I Hated This Movie,2,23 January 2010,"I am writing this after seeing Lovely Bones this week. I thought LB was a good, but flawed, movie, and to make a point, I contrasted it to a horrible film from 1998 called ""What Dreams May Come"".I have remembered, 12 years later, how much I hated this movie. I hated it because it's entirely, absolutely, completely, one big symbolic, memetic, allegorical, metaphorical bag of slop. It's preachy and overbearing and selfish. There is nothing to this movie except one filmmaker's bag of ""look at how interesting I am"" tripe. I relate this film to that vapid clown at a party who spends his whole time quoting things to show off how smart he is, meanwhile people are scurrying away to find something, ANYTHING more interesting to do.Robin Williams plays a husband who dies to find that his wife, who committed suicide some years ago, is not with him. He then travels like Orpheus to the bowels of hell to find her and redeem her. There's lots of plying through fantastic sets and matte paintings, lots of music, lots of blather from Cuba Gooding Jr. as ... well, you can't really figure out what he's supposed to be until the end when it's revealed to be something completely ludicrous. All the while Our Hero has to figure it all out.The big problem with symbolism is there is no connection. People -- well, sane people -- don't live in worlds of symbolism. Symbols can be used to represent things, sure, but in the end, we all actually live and experience our emotions, feelings, thoughts, friendships, and loves. If you sit around thinking the love you have for your spouse is a hot-air balloon covered with paintings of carousels or something, then you need mental help. As do the filmmakers of What Dreams May Come.My version of hell would be sitting through repeated viewings of this movie, perhaps in the form of a Powerpoint presentation narrated by a rhino in drag. The ONLY reason I'm giving this a 2 instead of a 1 is because I do not quite have the bile for this film that I do for Armageddon or The Village, two of the worst movies of all time.But I tell ya, this one is pretty damned close.",What Dreams May Come

This is yet another retelling of the Orpheus myth, with many of its principal roles--Robin Williams in particular--seriously miscast.

71,Snowgo,Williams: Great. Gooding: Mis-cast,7,7 August 2015,"I really like this ambitious, florid, morose and intense movie, but could not get past the fact that ""Cuba"" Gooding (Jr.., not Sr.) was mis-cast for the role as Williams' spiritual companion and guide. There was always an undercurrent of confrontation and violence to Gooding's demeanor. Even though he tried to quell it, it appeared just too intrinsic to his nature. There is a point in the film when Gooding's character is replaced by (the spirit of) an Asian woman (played by Rosalind Chao).., and perhaps the director, at that point, realized that the single-dimensional vehemence as displayed by Gooding was hampering the quality and altering the feel of the movie. Williams' acting, as Chris, is excellent, as is that of his wife (played by Annabella Sciorra) and Tracker (played by Max Von Sydow). The cinematography is not-to-be-missed.Many who watch this film will take exception to the message: Suicide equals eternal damnation and misery. I think we must take this equation in the context of dramatic art. I can forgive the writer of the original novel for creating such a scenario, where the loved one needs to be found and saved from an untenable and uncomfortable position in the after-life.One of my personal beliefs is that some create the ""death"" of their physical vehicle (body) so that they can enter the spirit world to be of rare and critical assistance to a loved one who is still in corporeal form; help that can only be offered and performed from the spiritual world. If my belief is true, then this may-well have been what Robin Williams did, in real life. Perhaps he needed that spiritual assistance, himself. These things usually happen without our conscious awareness.Actually, my proposition, that of entering the spirit state to help a person still alive, is not as ambitious as that made in the film: Spirits assisting each other, in very human, passionate displays.If the producer and casting director had had the sophistication to find someone to take the role of Chris' guide who had had a profoundly calm and insightful chemistry with Robin Williams, then this movie could have been considered a classic in the approach and understanding of love, life and death.",What Dreams May Come
72,kylehodgdon,"Could Have, And Should Have Been Much Better",6,17 November 2009,"When I first came upon this movie in 2002, I couldn't figure out why I had not heard of it before it looked and felt exactly like something that would be right up my alley. I guess it just kind of slipped beneath the radar back in 1998.This movie is absolutely stunning visually. To this day I cannot think of another movie that has a similar look to it as this one does. The colors are very vibrant and soft throughout and it is very neat how it almost makes the scenery feel as though it is playing with one another. The story seemed like it was going to be something that I would really find enjoyable, however, as it rolled along it became less and less appealing. It felt as though it never left second gear. I kept waiting and waiting for it to really pick up, but before I knew it the movie was over and really left me puzzled as to why there was such a lack in substance to a plot that felt like it could really be something great. The idea for the story was unique and interesting, but the execution was sub par. The performances were all very mediocre. None were bad, but nothing stood out.I really wish I could have enjoyed this movie more than I did because it really looks and feels like a winner, but after you get past that aspect and onto the real substance it will leave you with a sour taste in your mouth.",What Dreams May Come

74,BB-15,"Stunning Visuals, Fine Acting Make this Ambitious Film Work",7,14 June 1999,"What Dreams May Come starts out as a simple love story nicely played by Robin Williams and Anabella Sciorra. But then the film's plot quickly deals with a series of very tragic events. Now this movie could have turned out like My Life which was so painful that I stopped watching it after 20 minutes. But instead, I very much enjoyed What Dreams May Come.The film makers made a wise decision not to show much suffering until the second half of the film and build to it slowly. But even more importantly, this is a movie built on beautiful photography and images that carry the first half of the film. The art of computer animation, photography and art direction have never been more stunning than in this movie.After such a visually spectacular run of one great image after another the film runs into several problems. After a while the images of the afterlife become less imaginative and more uneven in quality. It may be that the film tried to show and explain too much. This over reaching also begins to affect the plot. The story slowly begins to sound too much like psychology 101. Too much weight is given to psychological problems and mental illness as the answer to many great questions in life and death. Sometimes things cannot be explained. Along with psychological problems we get a psychiatrist. The interaction between Williams and Max VonSydow which starts out contrasting and interesting becomes too much like a therapy session to feel natural. Finally and most importantly the film shifts too quickly from gloom and doom to happiness. It undermines the naturalness of the feelings brought about by most of the movie.With all of that said, what saves the second half of the film is that all of the performances are solid. While Williams is good as always it is Sciorra especially, giving the best performance of her career, which made me believe. Her torment becomes the heart of the film almost to the end.Even with the shifting of images, plot and mood, this film worked for me as a series of special moments. What Dreams May Come has beauty, pain and endurance. On top of that, I sense the sincerity of the film makers who try to answer the big questions of life, who explore mysteries of emotion and pain. More than being touched by What Dreams May Come, I respected the effort put into this film.",What Dreams May Come
75,DoctorSkyTower,A BIT TOO DEEP FOR MY LIKING....,5,27 March 2000,"A visually fascinating flick, the special effects are so special you could almost taste it! Robin Williams' character's views of heaven and hell were amazing eye candy, I liked the world that imitated his daughter's little fantasy doll house.  Story line: Deep. Very deep. I thought it was especially cruel that his wife would go to hell simply because she couldn't live without her husband and her children! Subjects covered: Suicide, life and death, heaven, hell and soul mates. This is covered in such a fantastical way it made me think I was watching some sadistic live-action Disney animated feature! Very Hollywood, one might say, on the sensitive subject of suicide.CONCLUSION: Not the sort of movie you would like to watch again, it was depressing throughout, although visual effects were worth 10/10. However, the rather dodgy story earns 5/10.",What Dreams May Come

People say it moved them when they saw it, but the only moving I saw in the cinema were the crowds leaving halfway through it (IT'S CRAP). Even the special effects that were raved about looked pitiful (IT'S CRAP). I must recommend that everyone should go and see this movie for one good reason (OTHER THAN IT'S CRAP). When people ask you your favourite movie of all time it is very difficult to give just one answer. When asked your worst movie of all time and you've seen ""What dreams may come"", you will have an answer for the rest of your life (IT'S CRAP).

What Dreams May Come takes you to the world beyond death and challenges your spiritual beliefs, not in a defiant and aggressive manner but rather gently and endearingly. There is this binary relationship between life and death, heaven and hell, good people and sinners.. etc. However, love becomes the controlling idea and the only human/divine power capable of bridging the gaps between those opposites. The heaven scenes are literally breathtaking and visually stunning. The hell scenes are equally horrifying and morbid. The story might be a bit slow-paced but the script makes up for that being beautifully written. Robin Williams was great as usual; the man who can make you laugh and cry in the same scene! Annabella Sciorra was so angelic... and yeah, she has the cutest laugh ever! :)",What Dreams May Come

The character Chris could be compared to the 'dedication' that lies within you and Annie is a 'goal' or 'aim' to reach no matter what ever comes on the way, and Albert is your 'super ego' who is a mixture of contradiction, he guides you sometimes and meanwhile becomes an obstacle. Robin Williams is an incredible performer, Cuba Gooding Jr. stands awesome with his acting,lady who performed the character of Annie was also perfect, hats off to those creative minds behind this wonderful making, likable narrating style, overall its fantastic, one thing is true that after watching this movie you come out with an idea that ""Your mind is everything,your imagination is everything and you can create your world within the world you live, but the only thing you must have is the Faith, Faith on yourself"".",What Dreams May Come
81,GHCool,This film deserves better,10,3 March 2007,"Although I can see both sides of the argument very clearly, I must say that WHAT DREAMS MAY COME worked for me despite some of its story problems. It is a part of my DVD collection is, in my opinion, one of the most beautiful films ever made. I have trouble accepting the way the WHAT DREAMS MAY COME deals with suicides and the happy ending has always bothered me, but up until that point, I find the film incredibly stimulating to the imagination and appreciate the level of artistry that went into its making. Consider: Robin Williams in what I think is one of his greatest performances. Annabella Sciora in an equally convincing performance. Max Von Sydow in a role that kind of echos his performance in THE SEVENTH SEAL. The painterly cinematography by Eduardo Serra (who later was nominated for an Oscar for the painterly THE GIRL WITH THE PEARL EARRING). Production design and visual effects unequaled in its imaginativeness. A full soundtrack of earth, heaven, hell, and beyond reflecting the human condition while making an imaginary world seem real and tangible.For all of these qualities, I feel like WHAT DREAMS MAY COME more than compensates for its philosophical and story-related flaws and what some have (unfairly) described as Hallmark card sentimentality.",What Dreams May Come
82,nelliebell-1,The Power of Suggestion: Its Aftermath,7,8 April 2006,"It is one of the more repulsive attributes that the motion picture provides for and that be that there is anything honest to the movies ability to be showcased.This film and it is made evident in the film does not bare the burden of honesty but of telling a story that will be interesting to tell and to watch(as in gate receipts and or other residuals)The terribly mis-leading assumption that the imagery and the lights camera action provide for anything more than lights camera action and a days work is about all that the motion picture can provide.It is almost to unfriendly to suggest that there is any importance in a motion picture however the war that has gripped the very foundations of integrity is that appearance and showing off with perhaps a loud mouth and a whole host of attributes that are in fact unseemly has gained a foothold in society and like a virtual plague have mis-directed our intelligence ability to a superficial and even fraudulent set of assumptions about reality and our place in it.The film as this review will testify to having seen more than once does not allow our ability to know different and as well to know better but it does give details however discretely and even not the kind of details that we can draw a conclusion but the kind of details that keep our interest.How to place the purpose had by this attempt upon intellect?The motion picture must move fast due to the many causes that moving fast provides for but what speed does for you does not provide detail nor,is our cognitive ability included in a comprehensive outline as such.When the children pass as a result of an accident why should it seem like it actually happened but nothing happened,we are only told so.In fact the children were very much believed in and there passing was not and that is why we live on even after we have lost something so dear to our hearts that we can not accept the counter to our place or the loss of our place here in this world.However it is in outline only that this is witnessed to though the qualifying position is that the children never leave the picture they only move through the film with only the scenery changing.The same can be said for the passing of the Robin Williams character however it is here we will stop and for cause.I don't think we are looking at the story line until we look at the suicide and that is what this film was attempting to look at right from the start.The 20th Century brought with it one of the maladies of time everlasting and that is the century of telecommunications.The blatant and ever encroaching imposition that these representatives of a foreign power provide for have had an effect that is as un-natural as it is imposing.The violence that has been the hallmark of the 20th Century witnesses more than to a simple phone call but to a power that has been trained to provide more than its your dime.This cold calculating treachery was never more foreign than it was ever conceived of and though it is difficult to understand that we actually had a Civil War which was about the right not to govern but to enslave a human being that seems to have been given a second life through the advent of the telecommunications bugaboo of radio,television,wireless communications and being able to send pictures through the air without wires in a act of telepathy.This virtual power of suggestion is the corner stone to what has in fact actually occurred and that is the heart has been shocked with the loss of its ability to dream.The dream has been imposed upon by a foreign power and is in fact quite dead and all that it represents has been removed.The American Dream is more of a beast not of this world which has hurt the human kinds ability to know.It further has damaged the conceit of Love true and otherwise to such an extent that we sometimes do not even recognize ourselves.This is what is in fact the cause of this crusade and why there was a need to tell a story just so about suicide.The female provides for a rather mean spirited shallow gathering of the complaints of life and she does not provide anything in return only as perhaps an afterthought.One of the losses that this film provides for is that life is not blessed and though its event is seen to have been doing just fine since time began we are not given the real perception of a family but of a constructed set of circumstances in which we must perhaps make all these assumptions.The film is mean spirited because it purpose is to flatter you with the frilly crap and schooled as well as practiced smiles and laughs.The laughs though are of a sort not common to laughter but to the discourse of the study of the personality.The necessity to beat one's self by committing an act of suicide is the carrying card of the 20th Century.It false attributes as well as lies about anything this mis-guided soul provides for does not give the audience a value that is known or even one to be witnessed to.There is in effect no redemptive value only more of the same and we are sort of stuck as to what in tar nations is going on here.The film does not provide an identity as to the culprit of this malady and like the Power of Suggestion the margins are meant mostly to suggest that the human kind doesn't do very well as a slave or for that matter when it is under the yoke of a tyrant.It is this power that is in fact the power that they are unable to identify because it is the driving force behind this conception of death.",What Dreams May

83,great_sphinx_42,"Artistic Dream, Hackneyed Romance",6,7 March 2001,"One of the most visually stunning movies I've ever seen, What Dreams May Come is worth renting or even buying just for that reason. I saw it in the theater and could only sit, gaping, through just about all of it after Chris (Robin Williams) gets to Heaven. I remember that I found the ending over-long then, but having watched it since then no longer feel that way. So all in all it should work perfectly. A fairly routine plot- soulmates are separated, in this case by Heaven and Hell, and one of them will go through both to find the other- held up splendidly by gorgeous visuals. Unfortunately, though, this movie has exactly one problem, and it's a doozy. I cannot for two seconds believe that Chris and Annie (Annabella Sciorra) and windswept soulmates. He's a bit too pedestrian and she's a bit too boring and self-absorbed. Granted, soulmates don't have to be supermodel rocket scientists living in Paris, but these two are the passionless nice couple who live next door, their dialogue sounding exactly like dialogue and nothing like anything soulmates would say to each other. But then, on the other hand, there are probably people who can overlook that or even believe the soulmate angle. Great for them- they get to enjoy the visuals and the love story. Luckily, though, this movie is such an achievement in the artistic department that even those who can't give in to the romantic cliche will be given plenty to recommend it.",What Dreams May Come

Up there, somewhere shouting down that he loves us, you think?",9,16 May 1999,"My one line summary is for those reviewers who said there was no mention of God in this movie. This movie is very much about God and his relationship to us. Written by Richard Matheson of ""Somewhere in Time"" fame (great movie about a timeless love story with Christopher Reeve & Jane Seymour) this is mainly a love story. I was lucky enough to see this on the big screen in a theater and the visuals were astounding! I left the theater sad though, and sure that I liked the movie but unsure why (as some said they didn't know why they didn't like the movie). Having seen it several times on video, I now know why. This is a movie that is better every time you see it. One viewing isn't enough. Upon seeing it at home, I realized what a powerful love story this is. I enjoyed performances from all involved. Robin Williams has developed into a fine actor. Annabella Sciorra  is so believable as a woman who loved too much. Cuba Gooding Jr. is his usual likeable, sincere self and very intense. There's a nice bit part for Max Von Sydow. If you can let your fancy go & just enjoy this for the love story it is, you will enjoy it.",What Dreams May Come

86,paul-nemecek,See What Dreams May Come,10,8 July 2018,"What Dreams May Come is about the ultimate quixotic quest. Robin Williams plays Chris Nielsen, a surgeon who quite literally ""marches into hell for a heavenly cause."" This is not the first time we have seen Williams playing a bereaved husband. In fact, almost every time he plays a bereaved husband he gets nominated for an Oscar (The Fisher King and Good Will Hunting). This may be no exception.Early in the film, Chris Nielsen loses his two children in an auto accident. Later in the film, Chris loses his wife. What makes this role a bit different for Williams is that in between these two tragic events, Nielsen is himself killed in an auto accident. Most of the movie takes place in ""heaven"" as Chris Nielsen adjusts to the afterlife, and what an afterlife it is.Part of the fun of this film is the art history lesson. One of the ideas put forth in the film is that the afterlife is constructed out of our own hopes and wishes. Because Chris Nielsen loved paintings, his afterlife is made up a series of paintings of which he is a part. The art direction, cinematography, and special effects are nothing short of spectacular. Parts of the film are like a random walk through the National Gallery in London with some scenes borrowing from the impressionists, others the surrealists, and so forth.Chris is guided through the rules of this afterlife by Albert (capably played by Cuba Gooding Jr.). While learning the rules of the game in the afterlife Chris discovers that his wife has committed suicide. Initially, he is excited about their pending reunion, but Albert informs him that because she committed suicide, she ended up elsewhere, and thus begins the quixotic quest, as Chris tries to find a way to save his wife.There are two kinds of people that will not be able to enjoy this film. The person who is skeptical about things religious will see it as romantic drivel. The ultra-fundamentalist will have difficulty getting past some of the new age nuances as he checks each point against his Scofield reference Bible. Both kinds will miss a valuable opportunity. Picasso once said ""art is a lie that makes us realize the truth."" This film is not so much about the afterlife, as it is about this life. While there are some painful deaths to contend with in this film, the film is ultimately about life and ultimate concerns. After seeing the film, my wife and I talked for hours about our lives, our meanings, our relationship.In addition to the engaging story, beautiful cinematography, and excellent acting by Robin Williams and Annabella Sciorra, there is an excellent score by Michael Kamen. Kamen composed the scores for the Die Hard and Lethal Weapon movies, as well as the scores for Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves and Mr. Holland's Opus. The interplay between the outstanding visuals and the dynamic score makes for some interesting impressions of heaven and hell. If you've been trying to find time to see a play, go to an art museum, and/or hear a concert, consider a trip to the movies instead and see what dreams may come.",What Dreams May Come
87,charlieoso,"""Annie, I'm here babe, I still exist.""",6,5 February 2019,"Not long after Robin Williams' death my better half and I were talking about his life and his films. My favourite one of his was DEAD POETS SOCIETY. This one was in her top 3. I am not sure where I was when this film came out, but oddly I had never heard of it, but boy did it ever sound interesting.In this film we meet Robin Williams who plays Chris Nielsen and Annabella Sciorra who plays Annie Collins. Quite soon we know they are meant for each other. But, ultimately true sadness seems to follow them. Years later their two children die in a car crash and in another situation Williams dies leaving Sciorra all alone. Williams is then sent to Heaven and Cuba Gooding Jr. Plays Albert Lewis who acts as Chris' as well as the audience's guide to Heaven and how it works. Sadly, Annie can no longer handle life and commits suicide. She though is sent to Hell due to her killing herself. Chris then goes on a quest to find his true love.I did think the film had a very interesting thought of the afterlife. I have only seen this film one time, but I know I will go back and watch it again. It did seem to have a lot of visuals going on. In fact it won an Oscar for Visual Effects. Next time I watch I will try and catch some of the visuals going on. Personally, I had my attention on both Williams and Sciorra as I thought they both put in some great and powerful performances. Based on a book by Richard Matheson, which I intend to read before I watch this film again. Perhaps after doing so I may change my vote from a 6. While, I have placed my vote I note that it may be changed along with this review if I begin to enjoy it more. It really isn't a film with a lot of laughs or wonderful feelings. It is more a film about two people and their undying love for each other. It is intense and may bring tears and sadness to some viewers.",What Dreams May Come
88,lucianomarzo92,"Has its moments, but overall kind of unsatisfying",5,2 May 2013,"This movie is one of the most beautifully filmed I have ever seen. It also has many intriguing and otherworldly settings, some of which some great scenes take place in, but despite the extraordinary cinematography , this movie had a lot of flaws. For one thing the pace is uneven. It was really fast at first, and then much slower, and then fast again; also the movie jumps around too much between past and present. The many deaths and tragedies in this movie seem contrived. The whole thing just wasn't really as affecting or convincing as it should have been. I could have overlooked a lot of this though if the ending wouldn't have been so syrupy. I'm not talking about the play of events, but the style in which it was written and filmed. It was just way too melodramatic especially considering all of the pain and loss that the characters had been experiencing for the whole movie.I like happy endings, but the level of happiness should match up with the content and style of the rest of the movie, and that didn't happen here. The overall mood of the movie wasn't dark enough for its premise. The loneliness and anguish were there mostly, but there just wasn't enough of a sense of urgency and dread for most of the movie.

90,KingProjector93,Some Dreams Are Just Too Big....,6,13 December 2014,"A vast tale of life, death and the nature of the afterlife, the films tells the story of a couple, the Nielsens, who first meet boating in Switzerland. Subsequently, we see their lives together and then the tragedies that befall them. First, their children die in a crash and then the husband, Chris (Williams), during an accident in a tunnel. He gets transported to the afterlife, which turns out less to be a strict affair, and more personally controlled, his vision adopting the form of his wife's (Sciorra) paintings. However, the pain is too much, and she commits suicide, which traps her in a more personal 'Hell' that Chris must, against all odds, save her from.Often seen as part of the 'Sap Years' for Williams (along with the likes of Bicentennial Man, Jakob the Liar and Patch Adams), What Dreams May come is both the most ambitious, yet also maybe the most frustrating, of the lot. There is genius locked within, but there are major snags; it has a really weak opening in Switzerland, with some of the worst 'romantic' dialogue I have ever heard outside of Twilight (and for a film that billed itself so much on groundbreaking visuals, they sure must've hired a cheap editor for that part as it often felt like Williams and Sciorra weren't even in the same scene together as they met on the boats). Furthermore, really middling chemistry between our two otherwise excellent leads bog this one down further. Because the film is so very much based on the power of their relationship, it really dilutes things as these two just don't have the chemistry to come off as a real couple.A shame as, on top of the lush visuals, and rather sizeable too for a non-action fantasy, there is some legitimate power in the film's take on mortality and what's after. The whole concept of the afterlife being more modelled after you and the way you died rather than some strict tier/sections is really intriguing, and we get plenty of contrasts, often in an almost pseudo Biblical-Buddhist manner, such as Hell being caused by denial and guilt rather than 'evil'. Also, aside from two strong albeit un-connecting performances, the rest of the cast is pretty solid, with Max Von Sydow and Cuba Gooding Jr really adding quite a bit to the emotional heart of the film, and Sydow's voice just makes the rules of the afterlife seem so much more grand and weighty. Oh, and Michael Kamen's score is just beautiful. Utterly.In the end, I applaud Vincent Ward for trying, I really do. He threw out his hand at such an expansive piece as this and injected flair. However, a few fundamental errors ended up costing the film a lot more than I would've liked, and though it's still leaps and bounds better than Williams' other meta-life epic 'Being Human', it still doesn't quite soar.

Standing out, as always, is Max Von Sydow.  Cuba Gooding, Jr. basically plays himself again, and Sciorra, while evidently trying hard to make something of a poorly~written character [Williams' wife], is pretty much window dressing.See either of the above~mentioned films if you can: the former for the amazing visuals [and for forcing you to think], the latter for the afterlife romance.All of that said, this is still a beautiful film: but again, see sentence one's disclaimer above.",What Dreams May Come

It never gets pedantic and that was probably the greatest danger there.

Admittedly, I saw it at a bad time in my life. My dog was ill, and I knew she was going to die. I rented this under the impression that it was some type of uplifting theme. Boy, was I wrong! How much death and damnation can you tolerate in one film. Since I was not the only one watching I stayed in the room, but tried my best to concentrate on something else. This was a thoroughly depressing film. I guess the theme was redemption at the end, but we had been dragged through so much muck on the way there that the ending didn't help. Avoid this film at all costs.",What Dreams May Come

101,yahiaaqil,Having a Split! Feeling Exposing ...,6,12 February 2021,"Since it's all about movies here; let's rate the movie. It is too boring, too slow with an overdose of sadness. Also, a lot of people will be confused since it's difficult to refer to the textual clues if you have never been through this pain, afraid to go through this pain or a good reader in philosophy and psychology. So, this is not made as a Hollywood drama movie for a general audience.However, we cannot deny the brilliant concepts and ideologies which were spotted in this movie. First, it discusses the psychological state-of-mind of the human being. It discusses the pre-trauma and post-trauma of a man's wellbeing state-of mind. Second, it targets a specific type of audience as well that would have another interpretation than words, it is the illustration of colors! You see, colors can in a brush of hope or a tool for death. Thinking of (poison of colors) alone can bring you chills.Third, (Death through Love):
Love can take you to different worlds. It works like magic. Sometimes you are in hell, sometimes you are in heaven. These are the two places of love. So this is the introduction of Death and Love together. Also, seeing love in death's mirror and otherwise is the ultimate love. You lose someone in your life, you grief and at some point you decide to quit life, but love remind you of strange things. The things that the diseased beloved wanted you to do before he or she left. Love then is the engine that takes you to strength! I am doing this now for my love, despite the face I am grieving over him/her!Now, what is more interesting to me and what people usually don't think of just simply because they are ALIVE, is (When I die, do I grief over my LIVING beloved ones?) Yes you do! You never know because you are alive now. You think that when you die, life is over and all gone and you live in the memories of others only. We also say, the living suffers more and sometimes we say death is more painful to the living from the dead.. the dead is a corpse.. the living is a soul.I also believe in that. However, when you love someone so much. Do you really think that death will put you apart from caring and loving him/her? I doubt so. I am no God and I don't know what is going to happen in the afterlife, but what I will try my best building that so called heaven based on the memories I had lived with my love. All sweet memories with that person will create my damn heaven and will let me pass through hell's doors just to save him/her from danger. Shall I grief as a dead body over my living beloved one? Yes for sure. That I will do in life and its after. With every tear shed from a living soul over my dead body, I'll be crying a river in grave.",What Dreams May Come
102,Norway1,Stunning visual effects - I forgot the rest...,6,6 December 1999,"<<Warning: Spoiler included>>I sort of have mixed feelings about this. First, it's definitely got EXCELLENT special effects. No doubt about that. Deserved the Oscar it won. I especially loved the painted world scene. Truly amazing!Also, I liked (or rather, appreciated) the interpretation of the ""next life"". It was really a very fine and interesting theory/concept about ""heaven"" and ""hell"".<SPOILER>The main thing I didn't really dig was the ending. They were together. They found each other and their kids. All was well. Then they decided to leave their kids and all their perfect dream world to be reincarnated and hope they find each other again!?! What was the point with that?</SPOILER>I guess I also liked the way it all was a bit ""dreamy"" and gave you the illusion of being in another world or in a dream. Even the way they talked, the music - everything.The book was surely a more enjoyable treat (aside from missing out on those stunning visual effects) because of the added character build-up and description it could give some of the (few) lacking moments in the film. I mean it felt a bit rushed at times and I think they just threw in a few ideas to try to please ""the masses"" (such as the reincarnation stuff, etc.) when it really could have been said better perhaps without all the extras (IMHO).To sum it up - It's worth the view if for nothing more than the visual effects and to see another take on the ""afterlife"". 7 out of 10.",What Dreams May Come
103,trixie-k-88,Beautiful and intense love story,9,23 March 2012,"Why do so many people hate this movie? I've heard of so many scathing reviews and even Family Guy has made fun of this for being a DVD that people never buy. This is really one of the best love stories I've ever seen, and is surely my favorite.Chris Nielson (Robin Williams) is a doctor who is very much in love with his wife Annie (Annabella Sciorra), an art director of a museum. Even when tragedy strikes and the Nielson's children Ian and Marie are killed in an accident, the loving couple keep each other going. Things get more intense when Chris dies a few years later in another car crash and goes to heaven. For Chris, heaven is a series of paintings, several of which Annie herself painted. Chris tries to get acclimated to heaven with the help of his daughter's deceased dog Katie and Albert (Cuba Gooding Jr.), his mentor from medical school. Much to Albert's surprise, new paintings Annie creates on Earth are visible in Chris' heaven, and they come to the conclusion that they are soulmates. Annie is in a deep depression, and it's not long before she commits suicide. While Chris is learning more from other people's heavens and reliving some memories about his children, he is devastated to hear that Annie is in hell—as all suicides go to hell. Chris refuses to accept this, and risks his soul to venture through purgatory and hell to find Annie and bring her back to heaven with him.This movie is fantastic. Rarely is there a romance that depicts a married couple still loving each other as much as the first day they met. Their love and life is so much deeper than ""love at first sight"" stories, or movies that end with the couple just beginning their romance or lives together. The stakes are high in this film, the main character is not risking his life for his wife, but his soul. Williams and Sciorra are great together, and you truly feel the deep love the feel for one another, and despair when they are apart. The visuals are amazing, and the use of art and color is surely grounds for study by art and film students. The depictions of purgatory and hell were also interesting, scary and disturbing. Some people squabble about the religious meanings and errors and what have you, butit's just a movie. Along with the romance between Annie and Chris, it shows the love story between the parents and children—even the family's love for the dog! It is an exceedingly depressing movie, but well worth it in the end. What Dreams May Come is an intense, beautiful love story that will stay with you for a long time.",What Dreams May Come
104,aernest,Agh. If only it weren't Robin WIlliams.,6,1 January 2009,"I didn't see this movie for years and years, (though the subject matter intrigued me greatly, since I teach Dante)because it starred Robin Williams. I have a REALLY low tolerance for the man, especially in those movies in which he's paired with a director who thinks it's screamingly funny just to ""let Robin go."" He just WRECKS movies. Anyway, today, New Year's Day 2009, I decided to watch it. And the director DOES exert some control over this rambunctious actor. But he was still distracting to me - I would have given this movie a 7 or 8 had it starred, oh, I don't know, Viggo Mortensen or someone quieter. The topic of the afterlife and the nature of heaven is not treated all that often in movies, and I liked the way this movie handled heaven. It reminded me a little of heaven in The Lovely Bones. I'll try not to reveal all plot twists, but I thought people's appearances in heaven were well done. Hell is not so well done, but the movie does stress that hell is definitely a personal choice. The plot is meh-ish, but I loved the ending. Not the ending you expect (which does happen), but the ending after that. Acting-wise, Williams gives it the old college try, and does honorably (for him), Annabella Sciorra, as Williams's wife, is OK, but I never really loved her the way this movie needs you to love her. The actors who played the daughter and the son were quite good - I wouldn't change them. Cuba Gooding does well, as does Max von Sydow.",What Dreams May Come

Here we have the story of soul mates and the lengths they'll go to stay together.  The scenery was fabulous and the concept quite orignal. Indeed, the notion of entering a dimension via artwork serves as metaphor for a far more powerful meaning that most probably missed.  Take a box of tissues with you -- if not for yourself than for the others at the cinema. Williams is magnificent and should have been recognised for this role!

106,Keyska2004,Death is only the beginning,8,18 November 2010,"Robin William takes on a very sensitive roll in playing the father and husband who loses both of his children in a accident. Having lost both of my children I was skeptical in watching this movie, but it has made my annual movie list to watch every year. Even though Robin loses his life and that is where this movie really takes off from, he has to deal with problems that he cannot control, or can he. The storyline is entrancing and well filmed. The color is fabulous, and the larger the screen to view this movie on the better it will be. Cuba Gooding Jr. acts as Robin's conscious in the middle of the film until Robin discovers who Cuba' character is actually. Please watch this film with a open mind, and accept what you see take place. Dante's Inferno comes to my mind when Robin has to go to Hell to move on to the next place. I cry every time at the end of the movie because I am happy on how it turns out. Not too many movies can take you full circle and bring you back like this one does.

There was a lot of borderline racist undertones in terms of how certain people appeared in the after life based on how they viewed their relationship with others before they died.  The visual effects were pretty cool - especially at the gate to hell - but other effects were obvious blue screen effects that did not look real at all.  And I can't believe it took the guy such a short time at the end of the film to accomplish what he did. My wife liked it.

109,Chanandler-Bong,Incredible and heartbreaking,9,14 August 2014,"Given the recent loss of the incredible talent of Robin Williams I found this film incredibly moving. Ir made me think about what his heaven would be like, if he was watching his family grieve and I hope he's found peace. This film hits home for a lot of us, obviously because Robin killed himself. I don't believe people who commit suicide out of sadness or loss of hope go to hell, I believe they go to heaven like everyone else - Maybe that's just me being idealistic. As a film though, this moved me a lot. It was quite a sad film but at the same time there were moments of joy and sweetness. The acting was superb. I've never seen Robin act in this kind of role and I think it brought out his gentle, loving side people who knew him often spoke about. He spoke with this fascinating softness that makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside.I feel he should be more well know for this role because its a great film. Annabella was also brilliant , she really brought out the raw emotion and pain a widow goes through after not only losing her children but then her husband. Although Cuba played a small part in this, his was also a great piece of acting (I wouldn't expect anything less from him). I cried a lot through this film, all for various reasons including the death of Robin and that pain of seeing him being wonderful and I am really going to miss him, also the film was very moving and does make you think, it also made me think of my life and what I'd do if certain people tragically left my life. So it hit home on quite a few levels. For its time the CG is actually pretty good, I've seen worse CG in films nowadays. Anyway, a fantastic film and anyone wishing to see a moving performance by Robin should watch this, he's incredible and always will be. I hope he's in his own private heaven at peace right now.",What Dreams May Come

The downfall of this movie is the constant sappy scenes thrown into the movie. One or two might be acceptable but half of the movie had to be sappy scenes (his wife crying, him crying, his kids crying, his doctor crying etc. etc.). My other problem with this movie was the plotholes. The plotholes weren't the fact that this was set in heaven but the fantasy world wasn't really fleshed out enough and explored in depth leading to many questions (an example would be why the doctor chose to be a shrink, why his kids didn't just come out and greet him, why his wife started screaming when he got close to her etc.). The plotholes, however, can be pardoned because the point of the movie was to be a romance not a solid scifi or fantasy film.In summary, the film has plotholes and far too many sappy scenes and the sappy scenes drag down this movie, but the concept is good.",What Dreams May Come
113,Artêmis,Disgusting,3,13 October 1999,"Horrible, horrible and horrible. That's the best adjective I've found for What dreams may come. Robin Williams plays again and as ever one good, honest and pure man(and he'll do it again in Jakob the liar... God! I'm tired). After his death, his wife suicides and now he has to go to the hell to catch her.First of all, the movie looks like a Mexican soap opera. Everybody dies in the family: the children, the husband and the wife. The sceneries, visual effects and the art direction are too exaggerated, everything is so colorful that you want to vomit. When Robin is in the heaven, he looks like a child. The scenes ""on heart"" are too small and the hell is ridiculous, with fire, bones and skulls everywhere. And both hell and heaven are full of people flying! It's pathetic.     After sleeping two hours, finally it ends... OK, I'll admit, the end is obvious but very beautiful and touching.

But, sadly, that's about all that can be said for it. The audience doesn't get a chance to emotionally connect with the characters before the plot is on its merry way--therefore the angst and the buckets of tears Robin Williams's character expends seem not only stilted, but difficult to believe (I was also greatly disturbed by the fact that, when acquainted with 'The Beyond', his character took so long to inquire about his own children). I think the cast did the best it could with a script that lacked cohesiveness. I WANTED to like this film; I appreciated how its story involved the concepts of many religious and spiritual faiths, combining them into an amalgam of One Great Truth.

The special effects were great and worthy of the Oscar that it won but the story was so slushy and sentimental it really got on my nerves and I couldn't wait for it to end.Robin Williams is always a good actor but with this and the films Jack and Fathers' Day in recent memory he doesn't 'alf pick some bad projects sometimes.",What Dreams May Come

Hey I don't mind sad or moving movies but this was a wannabe, people. I cried in Life is Beautiful.  I have feelings, but this is pure Hollywood$$$$trash$$$. I didn't even look cool after a while.

117,siit,The most under-rated movie ever ?,10,26 December 2005,"Firstly this is an adult movie. I remember when it was marketed on its release. It seemed to be targeted to all ages - Robin Williams off the back of- at that time- children's movies. It promoted the technology of the making. Overall they marketed it completely wrong, which I daresay has led it to being placed in the mediocrity bin.However, nothing could be further from the truth. What Dreams May Come would have to be one of the most intelligent, emotional, visually beautiful, and well acted projects ever to grace the screen.Robin Williams is masterful and Sciorra perfectly mirrors her soul mate (Williams). Their performances encapsulate all the joy and abject sorrow human life entails. It's a movie that wants you to find real love, see beyond cynicism and grasp the idea of soul mate. And it's all presented in a stunningly gorgeous montage of exquisite colour and symmetry.From the opening shot to the closing frame, its magnificent. The story is enveloping encompassing nearly every asset of human emotion. It's a roller-coaster ride but rewarding. Comedy, hope, sadness, joy, elation, despair... all displayed perfectly.ALL actors shine, Cuba Gooding Jr is his usual excellent self and Max von Sydow is impeccable.The greatest movie ever? close... most under-rated movie ever? - most probably.

Unfortunately for this film, (and its tortured viewers) that was all there was to this movie--false emotion and special effects. For good measure, the writers of this movie threw in some ridiculous idea about what Heaven and Hell are like and how people end up there.The acting, writing and directing were all poor.

Does any religion actually think this insult is what the afterlife looks like, or was I unwittingly dragged through someone's bad acid trip? Here's a movie about Heaven where God is only mentioned dismissively in one scene for about ten seconds. I think Daffy Duck floating up to the ceiling with a halo and a harp is more realistic. This is wishful thinking of what Heaven should look like for the ""Me"" Generation. Everything was relative to how you feel about it. Even Hell was just a manifestation of a big pity party. Here's how they came up with the idea for this movie. They took bits and pieces from every religion they could think of, secured a special effects budget of $50 million, added a medium-sized bag of crap, and ran it all through the high-speed blender.

121,DeusWar,What confusion may come!,7,17 August 2014,"In light of the recent events with Robin Williams passing I saw a top ten list of Robin William's movies in which 'What Dreams May Come' was listed. Surprisingly after reading the information about the movie I wondered why I had not seen this movie before. After all, it sounded like an interesting movie.Interested indeed.What Dreams May Come appears to be a 'New Age' rendition of the after life as well as a commentary or reflection on dealing with life and death. A fitting movie considering the events of recent times.Although the movie was ascetically excellent (for a 1998 film even!) it seemed to lack a smooth flow of events. I could not help but notice as I watched that the movie was hard to follow with events seeming to be pieced together, although not bad enough to where I would lose a sense of what the film was trying to communicate. Some of the concepts that I picked up on in this movie were as follows:Theme of Holding on and Letting Go. - Never giving up in this life or the next. - Life as well as the after life is all about 'ME'. - Heaven and Hell are all of MY making. If one adhere's to the popular American cult of 'The Secret' and other New-Age ideas, then 'What Dreams May Come' will be an interesting experience. However, if one does not buy into the New Age experience, then this movie will be lacking. This film is very 'American' in the sense that it communicates that one ought to be entitled to happiness in this life and the next. Our main character played by Williams loses his children, but eventually gains them back in the after-life. Although they choose to appear in a way that will satisfy him. He then later loses his wife, and treks to Hell to win her back where they both eventually have some seeming form of happiness. Then, at the end, they choose to be 'reborn' into the earth to pursue happiness again - I.E. try to seek each other out all over again. Therefore everything in their reality is based on them and their ability to find happiness. It is almost as if life/death is portrayed as cyclic as well as a cosmic thrill ride where we can choose to do what we want based on our own whims/desires. In this film Heaven and hell are based upon our ability to let go of life or not let go of life and be self-absorbed in our own version of life. Although there are apparently other ways to achieve hell, but they are not described in the film as to not offend anyone. This film does not deal with the reality/existence of God in the afterlife. For that reason it is lacking in my opinion!Overall the message of the film is hard to follow, but the ascetic value is high.",What Dreams May Come

It was visually stunning and made you want to be there with them. The drama never stopped and you can just let your imagination go crazy. Robin Williams was very believable and I really liked his role. It felt so real what he was going through because he's so genuine. And Cuba Gooding was great as the angel in heaven.

Unfortuneatly his dramatic works seems to be a series of good movies which slipped through the cracks. I've found him excellent in all.You don't have to agree with the concepts of life and death, and Heaven and Hell, to enjoy this movie. One concept has been taken here and presented beautifully. Special effects were fantastic for their time, and having just watched it again, still stand up well now. That's because the story is the vehicle here, CGI just one of the tools used. This is a love story through and through, and at a time when I needed it, reminded me of what true love is really supposed to be about.To all who called this a classic, I agree absolutely.

After she commits suicide, he then ventures into Hell to try to save her so that they can spend eternity together. Williams is good but here's my question: How does he get into Heaven when he says the ""f"" word on Earth, you can't curse your way into Heaven, and then he yet still curses IN Heaven.

Robin Williams looks (and acts ) constipated throughout the entire movie, Sciorra whines and suffers, and Gooding, well, plays Gooding, he hasn't proven himself to be an actor of any range yet (he certainly didn't deserve any awards for Jerry Maguire).  This is one endless sob story, without the slightest bit of humor.  I find the concept that a good person who commits suicide should be condemned to hell forever particularly offensive.  Who made this?  The right-wing 'Christian' Republicans?  Politically, I'm surprised Williams would be involved in this clap-trap. And what happened to Vincent Ward?

Yes it is very nicely filmed, and the scenes are colorful, and obviously with the high grade cast the acting is good... BUT the film is just too weird. Some of the reviews say it is the ultimate tear jerker but honestly I couldn't build enough empathy with any of the characters to feel moved to tears. There is just too much ""Dante circles of hell"". The concept of the story intrigued me enough to watch it but stylistically the production was over the top.

130,NousPax-1,What Dreams I've seen on Film!,10,25 November 2009,"Warning: Am a heavy sentimentalist and 40+ year searcher for ""Meaning of Life"" on the scientific and metaphysical sides and this biases my review. What Dreams May Come is a wonderful and dramatic tragedy and drama. Certainly in my top 10 out of thousands seen.It presents a plausible after life ""spirit"" existence without being dogmatic. Particularly wonderful for me was that Katie the dalmatian appears in ""heaven"" also. Really love Robin Williams ""nice guy"" movies and he is spectacular in this. Also really liked ""Good Morning Vietnam"" and especially ""Dead Poet's Society"" because his excellent characters in those are presenting positive and meaningful views of life. ""Captain, My Captain!"" is just wonderful in the context of Dead Poets. Anabella Sciorra is perfect in her role in this. Cuba Gooding, Jr. is eminently likable in this too. Max Von Sydow fits in perfectly too!Annie has every right to give up and commit suicide, blaming herself for the kids' deaths and later blaming herself for Chris's death too. The love that they have for each other and their children is very inspiring. Chris's sadness over pushing his son too hard is also very touching.What is most inspiring of all is when Chris finds Annie in hell, he loves her so much that he is willing to lose his mind and soul to stay there with her. How many people are fortunate enough to love like this?The scenery in ""Painted"" heaven is exquisite beyond words. The interplay between heaven and earth is very cool. The appearance of ""spirits"" differently than on earth is fascinating too. This is by far the foremost afterlife movie ever made. If you liked ""Heaven Can Wait"" and/or ""A Matter of Life and Death"" and/or ""Made in Heaven"" and/or ""The Bishop's Wife"" then run, don't walk to rent this divinely beautiful film. Also, the soundtrack by Michael Kamen is far and away the most beautiful film music I've ever heard out of thousands. It is out of production and expensive but worth it. It's just amazing the wondrous feeling that it invokes. With all the misery and ugly shat in this world caused by humans, this soundtrack will convince you for a time that all is beautiful.

I said it.I found the movie in the science fiction section of my video store, so let's get one thing straight from the get-go. This is not a science fiction movie. As Isaac Asimov once explained, good science fiction has to be good science and good fiction. This movie is bad fantasy.The theme is: Love conquers all, even Hell. I thought I was in Hell watching this movie. It is S-L-O-W. With long, long looks into the camera and frequently whispered I-love-you's. The Heaven and Hell scenes remind me of the Harry Potter movies; Heaven is not bliss and Hell is not agony. Somehow, in this movie neither life nor death are played for keeps.Real life is as preposterous as the Afterlife. Chris Nielsen (Robin Williams) is killed by a flying car (like in the James Bond movies) in the Lincoln Tunnel between NY and NJ. A flying car in the Lincoln Tunnel? I don't think so. The Lincoln Tunnel is usually so jammed with cars, it is a parking lot most of the time.And how did heaven become one of Annie's (Annabella Sciorra) paintings? It's just stupid.I don't know how this movie got made. Maybe the book reads better than the movie plays (this happens). And they got Robin Williams and Max Von Sydow?? How did that happen? Well, the presence of Cuba Gooding, Jr. (who seems a likable enough human being) should be enough to warn you that all is not well with this movie.""What Dreams May Come"" is an adolescent girl's fantasy of eternal love. My advice: go get a cup of coffee, instead, or go hang by your thumbs in a closet. Do anything except watch this movie; you will never get your 113 minutes back.",What Dreams May Come

The acting is putrid, the ""emotional scenes"" will cause you to enter a state of bloodlust, and everything else will want you to rip the video from the VCR and throw it into the fireplace.  If you'd like a simulation of ""What Dreams May Come"", take some rat poison, battery acid, human flesh, slugs, human deification, bug spray, Windex, motor oil, snail shells and about four thousand grams of salt, throw in a blender with dirty water and mix.

140,neal-57,Lost in the transition from novella to film: TRUTH.,6,13 February 2007,"Although it contains a few moments of real power, WHAT DREAMS MAY COME is a sad, pale echo of the powerful film it should be--which is not too surprising, considering the track record of writer Richard Matheson. Far too many of Matheson's stories have been mutilated in the transition to film; prime example: I AM LEGEND was screwed up TWICE, as THE LAST MAN ON EARTH with Vincent Price, and again as THE OMEGA MAN with Charlton Heston. Arguably the best realization of a Matheson story on screen was DUEL, which put young Steven Spielberg on the map--and that time, Matheson himself wrote the screenplay. (And, of course, he wrote many of the better original TWILIGHT ZONE stories.) In writing WHAT DREAMS MAY COME, Matheson set his cautionary tale of life before-and-after this brief time on earth, in a carefully-researched setting WHICH HE BELIEVED TO BE TRUE: the place from which we come into this world, and the place to which return after death. The research, of course, delves into the ever-growing number accounts of near-death experiences and past-life hypnotic regressions. Believe this scenario or disbelieve it as you will, to Matheson, as a setting, it was quite real, with its own hard and fast rules.Unfortunately, no such restrictions burdened director Vincent Ward or screenwriter Ron Bass, who produced a film that is rich in visuals but lacking in impact. Both novel and film tell the story of Chris Nielsen (a heartfelt performance by Robin Williams) and his efforts, after death, to redeem the heartbroken wife who committed suicide in the wake of his passing. The differences, however, are shattering:In the book, Annie (an intense, if somewhat misguided, Annabella Sciorra) takes her life after Chris' death, leaving her children to fend for themselves. Fearing that this rendered her unsympathetic, Ward and Bass killed off her children as well, as though the onslaught of grief could somehow ""excuse"" her suicide.In the book, Chris encounters, and is helped by, people he knew in life. In the film, these encounters become a bewildering (and pointless) series of mistaken identities: Cuba Gooding, Junior, is supposedly his old black mentor, but turns out to be his late son; Max Von Sydow, the mysterious ""tracker,"" turns out to be the old black mentor; and completing the trio of race changes, Rosalind Chao is the Asian-adult version of his daughter. This a a major violation of Matheson's scenario, in which PRETENSE IS STRIPPED AWAY IN THE AFTERLIFE, and one's identity is obvious to one and all regardless of whatever race, sex or other outward appearance one chooses to manifest.Most importantly, Chris remains oblivious to his situation, except for the information doled out sparingly to him by his contacts--although, in Matheson's scenario, a deceased person soon recovers the memories of his/her past, both earthly lives and time in the ""real"" (afterlife) world, and realizes his/her immediate past life was just a drop in the bucket.That said, the film works in a very few places--most vividly, when Chris finally finds his wife in her own personal ""hell"" (and the dialogue, for once, is largely based on what Matheson originally wrote.) But by and large, the cautionary message of Matheson's story--LIFE IS ETERNAL, SO BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU DO AND SAY--is completely lost in a film which, despite its award-winning special effects, ultimately disappears up its own rear end.

And trust me, I must have seen more than a thousand movies in my lifetime.I was bored last night. I saw that movie in my DVD collection. I've been putting it off for a while. I love Robin Williams and Cuba Gooding Jr. but I knew it was supposed to be a deep movie.I'm so glad I decided to watch it.Not only is it a visual masterpiece, stuff has been done in that movie that I've never seen in movies before, but the plot is extremely original and VERY complex and to make a movie out of it is impressive enough.Robin William's character goes through a soul searching experience. Another reason why I love this film is so did I. In a way I went through the same experiences that Robin's character did.Most of the time I think the ""soulmate"" stuff is very cheesy. But not this time. The actress who played his wife and Williams did such a superb job. You completely believed they were meant for each other and deeply in love. There is not one drop of cheesiness in this movie. It is just beautiful.I'm not much of a crier, I never cry in movies, but I had tears in my eyes at the end of it. Happy tears. I was really, really moved by a very creative ending. It's one of my favorite endings to a movie ever.Very few movies stun me but this is one of them. It's one where you actually go ""Wow"" at the end of it and still a bit stunned by your experience even a day later.Everyone should see this movie at least once. It's incredibly thoughtprovoking and suggests stuff I never thought of before.This movie deserved it's Acadamy award for the visual effects, but really the screenplay should have won too. It's very deep writing and tons of lines that make you say ""I never thought of it like that before!"" Go see this movie. Please. You will NOT be disappointed.",What Dreams May Come
145,Jeff G,A lot better than the critics have led us to believe,7,5 October 1998,"All right, the critics who have panned this film do have a point.  This movie is muddled and not a heck of a lot happens in it.  It's oversweet, and somewhat unsatisfying -- sort of like eating cotton candy for two hours.But even with these serious flaws (and they are serious flaws), this is a beautiful film.  It's a stunning work of art.  The visuals are absolutely amazing, the use of colors is genius, and the Kamen score brilliant.  This is a clearly a case where style triumphs over substance.A number of critics have complained that the dialogue was wooden.  I think this is due in part to our desensitivation to underplayed dialogue by DiCaprio-esque actors who insist on screaming all their lines.  ""I love you,"" isn't good enough.  These days, it has to be ""I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!"" screamed with heart-wrenching anguish while ripping open their T-Shirts in the rain.  Here Williams, Sciorra (sp?), Gooding, and Von Sydow actually *deliver* their lines with a restraint that is refreshing to see.  There certainly is emotion in them, and seemingly genuine at that, but it's a subtle delivery and one that can easily be missed by today's audiences if expectations aren't carefully set.I guess their are two types of filmgoers:  those who love schmaltz and those who don't.  If you don't love schmaltz, you'll be intensely bored with this film.  If you *do* love schmaltz, you'll be blown away and bored in about equal measure.",What Dreams May Come

151,jerrywright15,A Beautiful Movie,8,6 January 2013,"I'll be honest, I was born in 93 and have missed a lot of stunning movies by actors I enjoy watching nowadays such as, Robin Williams. I first got wind of this movie, while watching a Family Guy episode that featured a DVD of What Dreams May Come. I figured they were making fun of this particular movie for a reason, but having never seen it I couldn't guess why; so I settled on watching this movie for myself. I'm glad that I chose to pursue this wonderful movie by Director Vincent Ward. In a short explanation, What Dreams May Come, is about a husband and wife who experience a tragic event at the loss of their children in a car crash. Four years later, the recovering wife is thrown back into a depression following the loss of her husband in an accident she blames herself for. As the man lives on in the afterlife he learns of his wife's suicide and damning to hell. Willing to do anything for his wife, the husband leaves the safety of heaven to save his wife from eternal suffering. Starring Robin Williams, Annabella Sciorra and Cuba Gooding Jr, among other notables. The aspect that stands out the most to me about this film, is the scenery. The portrayal of heaven is simply beautiful, in fact it was so shockingly magnificent that I couldn't believe this was made in 98. From the flowing waterfalls to the painted fields, everything sang of pure perfection.Of course the environment, though the most stunning, is not the only beautiful feature. The family dynamic and relationship between William's character and Annabella Sciorra character was beyond inspiring. The emotional connection and love shared between the two seems to delve deeper then the film. Their acting was so believable, that it would not be hard to imagine these two together in reality. The children also did phenomenal jobs, in the small screen time they had, expressing their characters and emotional connection to their parents.The script was well written and felt natural to the characters, none of it seemed forced or contrived. Cuba Gooding was exceptional as a character meant to be more then he appeared and other than Radio, was probably one of my favorite characters of his.Now what stopped this movie from being a ten was also what made it great, the scenery. After watching how much time and effort they put into creating this memorizing heaven, I thought hell would be explored to the same degree. It didn't have to be this outrageously terrifying place full of twisted tortures and demons, but I at least wanted it to be more thought provoking, maybe have some metaphorical meanings for suffering and instead it was average at best. Hell never really felt like hell but more like purgatory of sorts. There was also a fair amount of flashbacks that I felt took away from Williams character exploring Hell. Maybe the movie was intended to be more about the characters past instead of him exploring Hell to find his wife, but when I read the synopsis it made it sound like this was about searching Hell for his troubled wife.Fortunately this is a minor fault and doesn't take too much away from this gem that I would recommend to any and everyone who are fans of stories about love and family and the strong connection between a man and his wife. Or if you enjoy cinematography, beautiful landscapes and especially if your a fan of Robin Williams, Annabella Sciorra or Cuba Gooding Jr. who deliver stellar performances.A definite 8 out of 10.",What Dreams May Come

What is the ideal place to retire? A place that kinda looks rugged and somewhat Italian, and not only that, all issues with the kids have been resolved (death according to Freud is a new beginning, so these kids ran away and hoped for a better life without these ridiculous parents.) But most of all this movie is about: do what the man says. The RW seems to be type cast to play wiggly characters who always gets what he wants with a stupid smile on his face. I understand his personal struggles, I'm talking about casting an directing struggles. Think about this entire world being created in this movie just for him (i.e. By him).

(I mean the one in the film, not my wife obviously!) Well, might this flick pick up some speed? Will the movie finally get a problem that the characters have to work on? No. To assume that Mr Williams' trip to hell and back would become an India Jones type of adventure was asking too much. Instead I got tortured with reviews of heart-tearing moments in a psychiatric clinic, whatsoever, and more vows of everlasting love. Give me a break!The appearance of Max von Sydow is a waste of talent. He must have had a moment of insanity (or an urgent call from his accountant) when he signed on to this project.The visual effects are worth a glance, but don't expect good entertainment.Thanks for your time.",What Dreams May Come

169,Shayde9,Grippingly emotional from beginning to end!,10,23 March 1999,"I first wanted to see this because of Robin Williams who I feel is a brilliant actor as well as a side-splitting comedian.  Then my husband and I started watching the movie.  Now, we knew it was going to be sad from reading the back of the video box (we didn't get to make it to the theatre unfortunately...I WISH we'd seen this on the big screen!!!)...but we weren't quite expecting how absolutely beautiful this movie was going to be.  The colors in this movie were absolutely gorgeous!  Even the scenery reached out from the television screen and grabbed not only our attentions but our hearts as well.  They were symbolic to the core.I don't want to give away the plot, but let us suffice to say that Robin Williams and Annabella Sciorra were beautifully cast in this movie about soul mates and how the ""Afterlife"" works.  I never thought I'd find my beliefs about reincarnation and the Afterlife portrayed in a movie, but this one managed to catch just about every single thing I believe in.  It confirmed my idea of soul mates and about love lasting beyond ""till death do you part.""And was it emotional!  I said before that we knew it was going to be sad. But even the happy scenes made us reach for the box of tissues.  I cried when things were sad and I cried when things were happy.  That was because when things hit a happy moment, they weren't just ""happy""...they were JOYOUS!  They were moments of complete exultation that I wanted to just leap through the screen and celebrate with the characters.  Those scenes of joy and happiness reached out from the television screen and grabbed my heart and squeezed so hard that I thought I would burst!  I never felt so happy from a movie in my life.  This was not a comedic ""happy"" either...although this movie did have its funny lines and moments.  It was a happiness from being aware of life and from knowing the joys of true love and soul bonding. It was a remarkable feeling.I recommend this movie to anyone.  If you've lost someone, see this because it offers a beautiful picture of what ""the better place"" is that they've gone on to.  It doesn't subscribe to any particular belief system at all. You don't have to be of any specific religion to enjoy this film at all. In fact, if anything, it offers the peace and harmony to strive for despite all our outward differences.  And it shows that heaven is what you make of it.
I've rarely EVER rated a movie a complete 10 or complete 100 or whatever the number may be on a rating scale.  But this one is absolutely perfect.  I intend to see it again and again, and as soon as possible, I'm adding this to our movie collection!",What Dreams May Come

Well, the one good thing I can say about this movie (from an artist's point of view) is that the visual effects were very well done and stunning. But that's it. Pieces of plot were dangled in front of you to give you a reason to keep watching, and they didn't try very hard. I love Robin Williams in almost everything I've seen him in, but this movie was the COMPLETE opposite of his usual characters. Such a thing is not usually bad... except in this case. Tragedy after tragedy was heaped upon him and his wife (Annabella Sciorra), and I usually LOVE depressing movies! WHAT DREAMS MAY COME, however, had pretty  much no comic relief. If I had to describe the theatric experience, I would have to say it was like I was squashed in my seat by a ten-ton weight (which was suddenly lifted when the movie was over).Now, I received free tickets to see this movie, and my friends, who I had used them for, were MAD at me afterwards for wasting their time with WHAT DREAMS MAY COME. How sad....Cuba Gooding Jr. played a good character in the movie, but the dialogue assigned to him was abominable.

Take a voyage with Matheson, Bass, and Serra through an Alighierian adventure. Robin Williams' character, Christy, narrates the life and death of a family whose bond is greater than the physical. Strong Buddhist overtones. Students of philosophy, religion, art, anthropology, and literature will appreciate this movie. The character of Annie, his wife, is less credible to the audience -- but not because of any lack within the ability of Annabella Sciorra to convey the character through her talented acting. Annie is a ""Beatrice"" -- the character is always a bit distant, almost intangible, always dangling just before the audience. She is vibrant and lively, but not quite real. The character is meant to be this way... we strive to attain what we don't quite possess, and if she were to be any more tangible, our hero -- Christy -- would not have anything to reach out for... and we would not have the journey ahead of us to travel.

But the effects are amazing and the vision of heaven is very original. Robin Williams is, as always, very good at performing. This was the first serious movie I saw featuring Williams, and I was amazed. I had thought Williams would be the type who could only act decently in comedies, but this one proved me wrong. He can put down a serious character with all ease not only that, he can truly touch you with his oh so tear-jerking lines.My conclusion: if you are planning on watching this movie, keep your tissues at hand, and some food and drinks as well since the movie isn't exactly what you call short.",What Dreams May Come
184,KvMauB,Paintings as Windows (possible spoiler),8,22 November 2004,"Although flawed and confusing at times, What Dreams May Come is still one of my favorite films because it coincidentally touched on several things that I find personally very dear and interesting.First, I grew up in a town in Switzerland next to a lake very much like the one shown in the film. I would sun in a boat just like that, while my father sailed it across the lake, and we would picnic. Although I have different views on an afterlife, it was nevertheless an interesting depiction of a personal heaven and hell and dealing with unbearable grief. I always seem to cry during certain parts. My favorite scene is when Christy encounters his old family dog. I still dream of briefly seeing my old childhood dogs, and we are so overjoyed at seeing each other again. I wake up with happy tears. Visually the film is mesmerizing. The use of such rich and evocative colors and odd, intentionally anachronistic architectures and art designs remind me of a day strolling through an art museum in some ancient European capitol. Some of the images are beautiful, some are very disturbing. I think Robin Williams is so charming in this film too. He once again proves that he is a solid dramatic actor. Probably most importantly, What Dreams May Come is one of the few films that indulges a fantasy I've long had of stepping into a painting. I have many paintings and prints in my home, and I've often wondered what it would be like to step into the world of that scene/that moment in time, as if it were a window. Haven't you ever wondered what was just around the bend in the road behind the Mona Lisa? Or to see 360 degrees around and what's behind the painter in say a beautiful Maxfield Parrish scene? This movie showed it just as I had imagined it, from the squelch of the paint, to the dreamy impressionistic look of the painted world.What Dreams May Come plays a little preachy depending on your philosophy and it's sad storyline may not be for everyone.

The frustrating aspect of this trend (are you listening Dean Devlin?) is a tendency to concentrate too much on the visuals.This is an ambitious film. Much is said regarding many abstract topics (love, tragedy, loss, the afterlife, etc.) and a great effort was made to effectively bring these images to realization. Make no mistake, this movie looks great!The only area I felt lacked substance was the script. When a film puts forth such daring eye-candy, I want something to wash it down with.

191,LVJeff,The One Couple in the History of the Universe,4,18 September 2000,"I'd guess you'd have to add me to the list of disappointed people.My girlfriend and I channel-surfed on to this movie one night on pay-tv. Luckily, we caught it at the very beginning, and the opening credits barely got started, so we got to see it in its entirety.  Also, luckily for me, I knew almost nothing about the film storywise, and what I thought I knew about the film, I would later find out, was erroneous.  It didn't matter, that didn't ruin my enjoyment of the film... or non-enjoyment, as the case may have been.Here's the usual SPOILER WARNING, which I think is important to give in a film like this, whose impact relies heavily on certain unexpected plot-points.  Read no further if you haven't seen it: a couple loses their two children in a car crash, and barely has the time to deal with the loss when the husband is killed as well, shortly afterward.  We follow the husband into the afterlife, where he is presented with what is essentially a paradise, and is re-united with his son and daughter.  However, he soon finds out that his wife on earth has committed suicide in grief, and for that she has been sentenced to an eternity in hell.  He quickly journeys to the underworld, accompanied by a guide and his son, to see his wife and, perhaps, save her.It's an intriguing plot indeed, but I had two major problems with it.First of all, we have to accept as fact the film's depiction of the afterlife.  This would normally have been no problem to me if it weren't for the fact that the presentation given is terribly corny and heavily Western-religious influenced.  I would expect a grandiose task of presenting a version of the afterlife to be handled with some originality at least, or perhaps something would be there that would seem new, exciting or surprising!  But, no, we get the standard heaven-and-hell structure, with heaven depicted as a world as perfect as you can imagine it, and hell populated by tormented souls who wallow in the mud like something stolen out of classic literature.  It's been done, and it certainly wasn't interesting.But that was a minor quibble compared to the main point of the plot itself: that we are watching a man whose love is so strong that he can do the impossible: raise his wife from the depths of hell.  OK.  I see that the movie is about this all-powerful, moving, conquering aspect of love. However, I am not convinced that I should just be happening to watch the one couple in the history of the universe who has succeeded in beating the afterlife system.  The son makes two things very clear to the father: that suicide condemns one to hell forever, and that no one has ever come up to paradise from hell.  Now, I assume that both heaven and hell here are populated by the souls of the history of the universe; that's a long time and a lot of people.  And this couple... this one here, in the movie, these two who are really no more special than neither you nor me... happens to be the ones who beat hell?  The husband makes the sacrifice of pure love, and that alone was good enough to take his wife away from eternal damnation.  I suppose those eternal rules aren't that strict.  By the time the ending arrived, the whole thing seemed terribly contrived, and left a bad taste in my mouth.  It's like someone tacked the big Hollywood sign, in big lights, on to the ending.In my opinion, the movie turned to be narrow-minded.  Not only did it present a hackneyed version of life-after-death, it tried to make us believe that the couple we were watching was the only exceptional couple in the known universe worth preserving eternal happiness for, nevermind the sufferings and love of others.  The only saving graces of the movie were the very impressive special effects, and, perhaps, its rather humble goal of simply being a strong love story.  But the love story, in the end, was just big and showy, not strong.  The movie is probably worth seeing for the controversy, and I don't think it's terrible... I just happen to agree with the naysayers on this one.",What Dreams May Come

This is the first feature film to use Fuji Vista film stock in order to capture color with an extra measure of saturation, and it works with startling effect.  What Dreams May Come can be appreciated simply as a visual exercise, as an ambitious attempt to show us a visual interpretation of heaven unlike we've seen before on film. So watch it just for that.  Yes, the story is sappy and syrup sweet, but as a surreal experience I really think the movie works.  The DVD is a marvelous digital transfer which does the film justice.

195,keenan-1,Could have been so much better with so little effort.,8,5 September 2005,"The DVD for this movie had been on my want list for quite some time; my loving and perceptive husband found it for me and gave it as a birthday gift. I cannot be entirely rational about critiquing it because no matter how many times I attempt to view it objectively my emotions take over and it turns into psychotherapy. It says much for its power that this still happens upon repeated viewings.For the record, for those of you who own or have access to the DVD version, I feel that the alternate ending is vastly superior to the one that ended up with the cinematic release. It has the advantage of being less Hollywood ""touchy-feely"" and much more meaningful and logical in a broad karmic sense. With the alternate ending, for instance, one gets much more of a sense of the children as individuals in their own rights as opposed to being bound into their only importance as part of the scripted family unit. The wheel continues to turn, affecting all of them, which is something that the alternate ending drives home and it is completely missing from the cinematic ending. I wish that they had made the braver decision rather than going for schmaltz. It's the only downside to the movie, but it is a marked source of dissatisfaction to me personally.(Perhaps this is a case where the extras you get on a DVD aren't worth it?

He has such extraordinary comic abilities, that sometimes he's difficult to totally absorb, because he's moving and talking so fast!  This was such an enjoyable change.

The use of brilliant color was also very beautiful.  The performances of all of the cast was terrific!

During the whole Robin Williams section of the movie, there are no stakes whatsoever until the very end. There's no dramatic tension. The landscapes and the dialogue are sickly sweet.

And what is this ""we create our own heaven"" stuff? Is this movie trying to make up its own religion?This movie has a terrible message, its paradise is New Age lite, Cuba Gooding Jr isn't very believable.

The children's babysitter is taking them to school and gets into a car accident. Both kids die.Then, one year later, Robin Williams is killed. Shortly after, Annabella Sciorra committs suicide.That's basically the entire movie. Oh, that, plus a lot of paint, silly music and an even worse Cuba Gooding Jr.Who wants to sit through two very depressing hours? I certainly wouldn't watch it again, and I don't recommend it to anyone. I mean, visually, it is pretty nice and the end result is one of joy, I guess, but getting there is just one hell of a bumpy ride.

204,majdic_stojan,Intriguing,7,11 July 2002,"OK, I have hard times dealing with such movies. It tends to show everything in black and white colors, with no grey tone in between. Good guys are good guys and bad guys are bad guys; although there are no bad guys in this one.The idea is ....... what? To tell us that love can save everyone? To tell us heaven is a place we create in our own mind? I don't know. But, on the other hand, it is a sweet movie. I mean, I like movies with happy end. Never mind if the end is predictable throughout the whole story.I think, the best part of the movie was acting of main characters, especially Sciarra persuaded me. Sure, Robin was excellent too, although not so persuasive and heart touching as Annabella.Visual effects were really stunning. I haven't seen a lot of movies with such good effects. But it simply isn't enough.I'd say, the movie nevertheless did touch me. I was sad all the way watching it, but in a good way. Not depressed, but sad. And maybe, just maybe, the message of the movie is really one you can live with. Sure, love is one of most important and powerful emotions and it can really change someone's life. As it did here, even in death.Bottom line is, I kinda liked it. And I wouldn't mind seeing it again. It's not a masterpiece, but a simple, touching movie.

No matter how tough you think you are, get ready for a different experience. Especially if you've lost someone already. Captivating performances by the cast, fantastic visual effects, a clever plot. I must admit I didn't even notice the film when it was released in the theatres, and my eye caught a television trailer a few weeks ago that made me search for it at the local video store.

Then watch as their entire l",7,12 January 2020,"(Writers note) I'm not feeling very well today so this review will be alot shorter.The GOOD: The over all images of this movie are breathtaking. The idea that hevan is what you make it is nothing new, but the idea of it being paintings. Genius! The canvas can be something new whenever you want it to be. I love the idea you can be anyone you want to be in heaven, even if its someone else. You're not limited to rules of the living world, and that's truly inspiring.I also love how we all have a common thought of heaven. In the movie its like victorian beach day by a lake. But still its true, we all have a common idea of heaven. You and i probably dont share it; but you share it with someone.The BAD: The writting boreing and unimaginative. The only really beauty in the writting was deliverd by Robin, but even then it was limited to maybe 50 lines? Hes one of the great3actorsnof our time, use his skill! You casted Cuba who really didn't have much if a role.I get this movie is from the 90s, but the kids look to similar for me. The costumes they're wearing are not different enough to actually represent them. Its almost as if they wanted the audience to consider them amourfic blobs as the real story was between a husband and wife.

208,BenderIsGreat,Worth more than a second look.,8,5 January 2005,"""What Dreams May Come"" was a beautiful story with stunning visuals and talented actors. And the rather unorthodox approach to Heaven was interesting to say the least. But as others have commented previously, I would have to agree that the ordering was often confusing and more than once even misleading. I'm sure the director/producer/writer or whoever had some reason for doing this, but I think it may have been one of those ""easier said than done"" moments on the drawing board. As far as the performance from Robin Williams, I was very satisfied. The part about his character that was less than satisfying was that he never made the audience form much of an opinion about him. Perhaps this was simply because not enough background information or sequential experiences were provided to us, neither of which were the fault of the actors. In my opinion, Robin Williams brought all he could to the role, which was more than anyone else could have done. Where the visual appearance and elements of art come into the film (which is almost everywhere after his death), I was absolutely thrilled. I think that this can mean more to someone who takes an interest in art or to whom art means something more, because it involves you in the paintings and the atmosphere at a whole new level and in some cases almost makes you overlook the bad organization and development. But you don't have to know or like anything about art to be amazed by this movie. It just serves to make a connection where the producers may have failed.So, because I was so impressed by Robin Williams and Cuba Gooding Jr. and the colors and styles of the movie, I hold it in high favor. But I can see where it gets confusing and slapdash, and I too wish it had been put together better because I think they passed up the chance to make one of the best movies ever.",What Dreams May Come

This is that movie. Now sure, Aladdin, Dead Poets Society, and Good Will Hunting were also great, this one is a personal favorite of mine. Beautifully shot and acted, this is one of the best movies I've seen from the man. It's also a real tearjerker too, and I (Who rarely cries) found myself holding back tears because of how beautiful, creative, exciting and saddening it was. Despite my views on an afterlife, this was a well crafted movie and gets and 8 out of 10 from me. I have very little complaints about the movie, after all, no film is perfect.

The trick is taking them in without becoming utterly nauseated in the process.Anyone who has done any serious thinking about life and literature is probably going to have some serious problems with this flick. One gets a smattering of lots of different philosophies--Hindu, Buddhist, Judeo-Christian, Jungian, ""New Age"" (which is probably the moniker that best encapsulates the views of life and afterlife)--and lots of borrowed symbols from various brands of mythology, but it's all so mush-minded that ultimately none of the ideas are the least bit compelling. Of course, the weak dialogue doesn't help... it's the kind smug, sophomoric writing where EVERYTHING sounds like a cliché, even when it isn't (which is almost never). The whole mess is capped by a New-Age retelling of the Orpheus legend, with a hell/underworld populated by countless kvetching souls.As an actor, Robin Williams seems to have two modes: twinkly, calculated lovability and scrappy earnestness, and it's impossible to say which one is more annoying. Annabella Sciorra manages to get in some good work in a thankless role.I found myself constantly rolling my eyes and groaning through this one... the only explanation I can come up with as to how I managed to watch the whole thing is the car-wreck analogy--you desperately want to look away but you just... can't...",What Dreams May Come
214,dindrane,Open your eyes,8,30 October 1999,"A movie often maligned by jaded American audiences, What Dreams May Come deserves a second look.  It doesn't forget that cinema is a *visual* medium, yet it also keeps up with the fact that they're supposed to be telling a story.  The lack of character development has been decried by some, but the fact that all of the characters are *dead* should be understood, as should the fact that all of the main characters do, in fact, change and grow, becoming, paradoxically, more alive than they were in life.  The movie succeeds in being touching and tragic without becoming overly maudlin.  It is a prime example of how very individual life (and the afterlife) really is.  Your individual idea of heaven or hell is not *supposed* to be identical to anyone else's, and the movie does not forget that.  We, as audiences, shouldn't either.A wonderful film that could do much to rejuvenate the tired Hollywood hit machine.  Give it an honest chance with open eyes.",What Dreams May Come

I had just read the novel it's based upon--which left me crying for joy--and I wondered how it could possibly be filmed at all. Fortunately, Perez and Bass found a perfect visual metaphor, by adding the recurring motif of painting.  They also added a few pleasant surprises involving the characters played by Cuba Gooding and Rosalind Chao, and the most terrifying visions of hell ever.  Robin Williams has never been better. I've never seen Annabella Sciorra before, but she was outstanding--she played Annie's grief and despair so well, it was heartrending. I won't give it away for those who haven't seen the film or read the book, but there is a scene in Hell, where Chris proves how much he loves Annie by making the ultimate sacrifice.  Apparently this is so unprecedented that it moves Hell and Heaven. If you have an open mind about life, death, and whatever comes next, please give this film a chance.

Lots of special effects and other tricks do not a worthwhile story make. At the end, what do we have? Is it all a dream or is the Robin Williams character really dead? With the title, it seemed likely that the Williams character was in a coma or something like that and would eventually emerge; at the end. Alas no, and apparently the film is intended to be a depiction of what the after life is really like. Is it supposed to be a total fantasy? I kept waiting for some meaningful insight and life illuminating content only to be let down at the conclusion. A big disappointment and much below the apparent capability of the actors. Max VonSnydow is excellent, as usual, as is the rest of the cast, but the story and execution is flumery and not worthy of any of them.",What Dreams May Come

The special feature being What Dreams May Come.I'll tell you this now, i've never cried at a movie. NEVER. In my life, before this. I'm one of those guys that choose to hold everything in not show any emotions, with the exception of laughter, with a movie. But for this movie, i could not hold back.Robin Williams plays a doctor who meets a woman on a lake, falls in love with her and has two kids. The standard romance movie plot. And that's what you expect from then on. Well suddenly one day, Williams loses his kids in a car accident. The ending scene there, was such a killer. I cried like a bi*ch if that is at all appropriate. Usually for these kinds of scenes i find them somewhat saddening but nothing to freak out about. A good example of this is Armageddon (when Willis dies). Well, after that Williams dies in a car accident too, and is introduced to a vivid, lush after-life that exists within his own imagination. He envisions his after-life as one of his wifes paintings, and is met there by Cuban Gooding Jr. who guides him into controlling his after-life so that he can explore it better. The plot changes so dramatically that it destroys anything you ever expect. Now that's what a great movie is.From then on it's up to you to watch. Because i forbid myself to ruin such a great movie for you. But the plot is great, and the acting is the best i've seen. Robin Williams adds the emotional element that is so rare to find in movies.

220,muchiPRODs,Trying to explain the art that I enjoyed,9,21 January 2006,"It is not a religious essay. Unless you understand 'religion' as what matters that joins us all. That is before you start thinking in an excuse to accept of reject something. Just after your reaction when experiencing some lost in your life.That 'sort of' religion that joins us in a common feeling, is art.I guess that every time in history had people sharing a special bunch of common feelings about important things of life. Then,artists like all those that worked this movie out, succeeded in giving words and image to those specific feelings. We feel 'moved' by experimenting such coincidence and sharing it with others. That is the reason why Chris goes to a heaven that is the painting of his beloved. This reminds me one story of J.R.Tolkien called ""Ham's Leaf"". Where the painter of a landscape, goes to live inside his painting when he dies.I didn't want to see this film for a while. I didn't want to have a special feeling about death or life (because of personal experiences). But when I casually watched this film on TV I got caught instantly. This is for me the sign of a good movie: I am unable to move until the film ends. I saw in this film lots of signs of these times. An excess of beauty in all. A lack of faith in the sense of existence. A lot of information about everything. And such a big fear of loosing one's beloved.This film has made a masterpiece with all these strong feelings! You don't have to believe in afterlife to see this movie. Just stay opened to your heart. Even if there is something out there, it would never be what we expect it to be. That is for sure. Because, life has always been like this. Instead of expecting something, just stay open minded, and see what it happens. You'll surely be surprised! (and that is nice)",What Dreams May Come

And, what, the hell was Cuba Gooding? The Phantom Menace? Who directed this? Who edited it? The protagonist should have just died and have gone to heaven from the get go, that way we would not have wasted the first 15 minutes of the film. Give me a break within 15 minutes, the protagonist met his wife in Switzerland as a ""young"" and UGLY Robin Williams, then there was their wedding scene, and thereafter their two teenage whiny sons!!!!!!!!

There is some really great special effects in this movie and some of it is breath taking or could be if I didn't know I wasn't seeing all of it or didn't get reminded of this fact every time the camera pans to the other side of the screen.But visual affects and beauty aside, this movie could stand on the concepts it depicts and twists it offers. I cannot say that I agree with everything in What Dreams May Come, but I can say that I liked the way they tried to illustrate their vision. There was some real creativity and freshness that was infused into this rather well-traveled theme. Although I have seen other movies that claim to show the afterlife, none have done quite as good of job describing without oversimplification or extensive detail. Matheson and Bass really try to let the viewer determine what they are seeing ... to paint their own picture, if you will.I am starting to feel like a Robin Williams fan, despite myself.

229,junay01,A Delectable Dream!,9,2 February 2006,"I just watched the movie ""What dreams may come"" and I should say it was one of the most scenic treats yet emotionally fulfilling movies I have seen. It is filled with wonderful scenes of heaven and a dark interesting view of hell. What I loved most about the movie is its' theme that heaven can be whatever you want it to be; It is the true realization of our dreams and the extent of our imaginations personified in our own paradise. People have the choice to reincarnate as well as exercising their passions to their full potentials.I was watching ""The 40 year old Virgin"" the other day and there was a scene where one of the characters talk about how great it is to watch the movie ""Ghandi"" when they're high on marijuana. If ""Ghandi"" indeed strikes our intellectual capacity while high, then watching ""What Dreams May come"" will stimulate both your intellectual, emotional and your sense of sight to its maximum level. The movie itself is a natural high. Director Vincent Ward has created a delight to our visual and creative senses in order to give us a different take on what may be awaiting for us. And what else do we ask of that one blunt we choose to inhale? We ask that it take us away, that it might bring us to a different dimension and give us an alternative to the unfair life that we live in. ""What Dreams may come"" does just that. Like a great movie should do, it takes you away somewhere else and keeps you at the edge of your seat to see what new area of heaven will the characters will explore.Cuba Gooding Jr. does a wonderful job as Robin Williams' angel. His soothing voice and distinct voice gives heaven a serene yet human tone. The human tone that hints our yearning to remain humans, filled with emotion and character, even when in heaven. Robin Williams portrays that human quality, when we can clearly see his satisfaction in heaven yet a drive that keeps him going to find his wife. The search for his wife in hell becomes the plot of this movie, which greatly weaves the unbearable human emotion of loss with the beautiful unknown destiny of our humanity. ""What Dreams May come"" portrays the virtue of being hopeful and that once we lose that hope we may succumb to a dangerous path in life.Indeed, ""What Dreams May Come"" is a beautiful painting waiting to be discovered.",What Dreams May Come

My girlfriend isn't the emotional type so this is a remarkable achievement. My girlfriend's sister however is; after watching the film she cried for three days, eventually screeched ""Why would you make me watch that?!?"" and refuses to watch the film again. Nobody is sure, but we think she liked it.This film is stunning; Robin Williams immerses himself completely into the role and drags the audience on a journey with him. At first I was a little sceptical, the movie does not move very fast. After the initial half an hour you're left wondering whether anything else is going to happen. But the film gathers momentum. It chugs up an emotional incliner, and after a selection of small stomach churning loops, vomits you mercilessly into the final descent. The trip to hell.This is the bit that makes my girlfriend cry every time and left me feeling emotionally drained. Critics have slated this film and Williams portrayal, but I have nothing but admiration for such a versatile and talented actor. His work is breathtaking. This film has been widely overlooked by audiences - I didn't even know it existed until my girlfriend pulled it out of a cupboard - but it is a visually stunning masterpiece that will leave you laughing, crying, exhilarated and deflated all in two hours.",What Dreams May Come

Everyone should watch this film for that one scene alone.Robin Williams again excels in a straight role, though some of the other acting is of lower quality.The scenes within hell are very well done, lots of different ideas of hell, indeed I'm sure that we each carry round our own ideas of our personal hell.

I loved the uniqueness in it, even if one even didn't totally flow to the next, what can you expect when you travel through Hell?  I have to say, though, that if he was in Hell, maybe I should start having more fun because Hell didn't look so bad...

234,Icenols,A film that proves to be a hodgepodge of incongruities,4,4 October 1998,"""What Dreams May Come,"" is a film that teeters between beauty and ugliness; between fantasy and harsh reality. It is a film that will leave the viewer wondering exactly ""what"" was it that they saw. The film makers consider this a romance...it is, but with a sickened view of what too much love, too much blame, too much demand can do to the personal psyche of a family. Despite the love, there is the blame. The blame Robin Williams ultimately accepts, the blame that his wife, played by Annabella Sciorra always carries for the accidental deaths of first her children, then her husband, played by Williams. This blame is too much...she commits suicide, while her family are in filmmaker Vince Ward's version of heaven. Williams takes the trip to hell to find his wife with the admonition from The Tracker, played by Max von Sydow, ""Once her reality becomes yours, there's really no way back."" She does get back, though, and she and Williams decide to begin life again, on earth, to discover one another once again. There is little comfort in the ending of this film, however, because it leaves the viewer bewildered and unsure of what they just saw; and for those who hold a view on heaven and hell this film will prove to be a hodgepodge of incongruities.",What Dreams May Come

238,bruceh-2,"Non-traditional theology aside, a fabulous movie.",9,1 November 1998,"A wonderful non-comedic performance by Robin Williams (Awakenings, Dead Poets Society).  Some may find this movie somewhat disjointed with various flashbacks, etc., but it does fit the paradigm of human thought.  We find ourselves remembering things at different times; a side-tracking of sorts which brings seemingly unrelated events together at various points in time. In this case, it provides a natural unfolding of our understanding of William's character and past.While the movie does not adhere to traditional views of the afterlife, and (more or less) side-steps the issue of evil, it is nevertheless a tale which carries us off to ""what a wonderful heaven it would be..."".  No doubt some people might find it sacreligious, but those who reject this movie on those grounds will be losing out.  Don't let the ""feel-good"" theology stop you from seeing this film.One point that this movie made clear, and did a magnificent job of doing so, is that our relationships, especially with family members, is often molded by our preconceptions:  our relationships often obscure the other person as an individual.  If we could see our loved ones in an objective light, our attitudes may well change for the better.  We also see the deep-seated effects that some of our comments may have; consider well the implications of what you say before you say it.What Dreams May Come has some absolutely delightful imagery; it takes reality and adds magic to it.  I will be surprised (and disappointed) if this movie does not win awards for cinematography and special-effects, and will be downright upset if it doesn't get nominated for them.Go out and see this movie.  Think about your relationship(s) with those you love; any moment can be our last.Never give up.",What Dreams May Come

After ""Ghost"" with Swayze and Moore, it's another nice image of the world beyond death.Williams seems to be not at his best, though, or maybe it's just his role which is not very dynamic. In fact, there's not a lot of dynamics in the movie. On the contrary, it flows calmly and peacefully, just as we would imagine the life after death should flow. In this way, the effect of being THERE is achieved. Nevertheless, despite the overall calmness of the movie, it has certain suspense in its drama.",What Dreams May Come
241,polystyreneman64,One of the most visually stunning films ever,10,16 March 2003,"What Dreams May Come tells the story of a family torn apart by tragedy and despair.  It offers a stunning, arresting vision of the afterlife and preaches that love can conquer any physical (or metaphysical) boundaries. It so happens to be one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen, and one unfortunately dismissed by most critics as being corny and overly sentimental.  I would argue that it is instead a masterpiece, and one of the best films of the 1990's.Robin Williams and Annabella Sciorra star as Chris and Annie Nielson, a successful couple who have, seemingly, the perfect suburban life until tragedy strikes when the couple's two children are killed in an accident. To make matters worse, Chris, a doctor, dies in a car accident several years later.  These events leave Annie, an art curator and aficionado, in a state of emotional wreckage from which she is seemingly unable to recover. Meanwhile, Chris begins to relish the afterlife, a world where everything is coated in paint like an artist's palette.  He soon discovers that his mortal wife is able to communicate with him--through her paintings; her increasingly bleak artwork begins to populate his otherwise sublime world. With some help from friends he encounters in the heavens, Chris sets out to save Annie from her personal demons--a challenge much more difficult than he thought possible.The director, New Zealander Vincent Ward, follows up his previous film Map of the Human Heart with another great visual work.  While that film explored the barren landscape of Alaska, What Dreams May Come creates a whole new world, a world not unlike the depiction of the heavens seen in Renaissance artwork.  Robin Williams is the perfect actor to play Chris, an immensely likable character who we grow to sympathize with and who we want to see succeed in his final quest.  Annabella Sciorra is absolutely wonderful as Annie; look at the despair in her eyes, for example, when she is haunted by Chris's ghost at his funeral--you can practically feel the goosebumps yourself.  Her performance was definitely worthy of an Oscar nomination. Cuba Gooding, Jr. also performs well in a smaller role.Some may find the romance in What Dreams May Come a bit too sentimental and many find its conclusion too tidy, but the mood of the movie is one of hope, of restoring and rejuvenating love, and the ending is definitely true to this mood.  Anyway, the visuals in What Dreams May Come are most important, and they make it worth the price of admission alone.  This is a rare film, abundant in imagination and beauty alike.  And it's one of the few movies that's ever inspired me to want to make movies myself.  I give What Dreams May Come my highest recommendation.     10/10",What Dreams May Come

Robin Williams definitely pulled this one off greatly, and the visuals and appearance will blow your mind!

246,ali-x,Watch Only if You Have Time to WASTE.,6,26 March 2006,"WARNING: CONTAINS (stupid) SPOILER""Beauty is in the eye of the beholder."" Perhaps, Vincent Ward has heard that line a few too many times and has decided to focus his film a little too much on the eye aspect. In ""What Dreams May Come"", his objective lies in the same boat as other filmmakersto grasp the audience's attention and entertain through visual images and thought-provoking themes. Ward presents ""What Dreams May Come"" with many impressive visual techniques and compelling themes, but his so-called provocative elements serve too much as an overwhelming clusterleading the cinematic experience to be much more overbearing than enjoyable.The use of color is powerful but far from subtle. The symbolism associated with the colors was very adequate to the presentation of the film but far too obvious. For example, the recurring connotations of red with love and blue with ambiguity were seemingly frequent. Every time the character of Robin Williams was reunited with his wife, something in the foreground of the characters was red. Blue was often associated with the suicidal wife or the clothing of the characters before they reached their deaths.Special effects, on the other hand, were overused. The slow motion during the mother and child reunion was over-dramatic. The expression in the characters' faces sufficed for the emotional scene; the slow motion exaggerated it. Also, the continuous flashbacks served more as a distraction and a pretentious addition. The storyline did not require the frequent flashbacks to explain the events in the film. The audience is not composed of idiots who lack common sense.Also, the conception of afterlife may appeal to a majority of audiences, but the style the themes were delivered strived too hard to be deep and just added to the heap. For example, the unbreakable emotional connection between soul mates after death was tacky. Whenever the wife painted a picture, the husband could see it in his personal heavenwhich was made of paint, because he and his wife shared a passion for art. Hell was pretty interesting as well; it was a burning boat. Ward's perspective on the inseparability between soul mates, heaven and hell is both abstract and fascinating but overdone.The melodramatic mise en scéne of ""What Dreams May Come"" provided tasteful color usage, special effects, and an interesting plot. The key to a good film does not lie in constantly throwing vivid images and multiple themes on screen. In fact, successfully combining such deep messages and beautiful cinematography requires simplicity, subtlety and ingenuity.",What Dreams May Come
247,Mulholland-95,One masterpiece of the fantastic cinema,10,7 January 2017,"What dreams may come is an excellent movie of Vicent Ward in 1998, however this film is little known between people.This movie have many important and essential elements, all together make one dear story, this elements are: -The story between Chris Nielsen and Annie Collins before and after of death. -The nostalgic and profound soundtrack. -The impressive special effects about the life after of death. -The photography of nature and art.I consider some parts of film are interesting: -During the Chris's travel, he has memories with each member of family. -When Chris realize his transition to the other life, he wake up in a place makes of paint, like impressionist art. -The communication between Annie and Chris trough of painting. -The absence of angels and demons, but the story affirms the God's existence. -The takes of nature: purple trees, waterfall, mountains and sky. These pictures give us an comfortable and surrealistic sensations.Like 2001: A Space Odyssey, it won the Academy Award for Best Special Effects, with a difference of thirty years.The story can divide in specific parts: -The life between Christopher and Annie: when they were young, their marriage, their children, the death of Ian and Marie and finally the Chris's death. -Chris discovers the life after of death: the Chris's soul sees his wife, Chris going to the light (transition to the other life), Chris insides his own universe, first of paint later to the reality, in this lapse, he finds his ancient chief, Albert, and his daughter. -Chris going to hell: Annie suicides, Chris and Albert seek the tracker, the three go to hell, like Dante's Inferno, for rescue Annie, Chris discovers his son, finally Chris finds and talks with her wife. -The final resolution: Chris and Annie go to heaven and they decide to reincarnate for have a new story.Finally, I believe that 'What dreams may come' is a excellent movie for many reasons and I believe that this film could get one better recognition for more people.",What Dreams May Come
248,billm-17,"""Majestically terrible""",3,9 March 2006,"While the effects and setting of this film are exceptional and should warrant it a higher rating...the absolute butchering of the book with an unconvincing back story about the kids and dialogue that makes 4th grade drama class more convincing, totally ruined this movie for me.As much as I love Robin Williams, the poor bastard did not stand a chance with this dialogue. His performance as ""Christy"" (a very odd deviation from the novel) left me completely unconvinced that this man would give anything for his wife Annie. And what is the deal with Robin Williams and being underwater? Most of his more light-hearted films all center around being underwater, and I honestly cannot stand it. I swear they used stock footage from Hook, but avoided the mermaids.The whole scene of Hell is also underwhelming to the greatest extent of the word. The line, ""This hasn't been a very good day."" is meant to lighten the mood, but this is Hell the God's sake! The idea is hopelessness. This is the entire reason for the damn place, not to hear a damned soul make a funny quip about his current suffering.The flashbacks to his children and Annie reek of hackneyed, overused, Hollywood dialogue that is meant to be heartwarming, but really just made me sick.For your sake, avoid this movie at all costs.

Well, it IS good-looking in a way that I've not seen since ""Baron Munchausen"" or maybe ""Brazil.""  But then I got mired in the conception of Heaven/Hell as seen in this movie.  You can have anything in Heaven, but there are rules about how to perceive things and move around.  It's whatever you want it to be, but Chris can't have Annie (first she's alive, then she's in Hell; what if they'd had a different kind of relationship and she didn't want HIM?  Chris' perception of Annie can be just fantasy anyway, right?).  And of course, how could you enjoy Heaven knowing the ""lost souls"" are stuck and in torment?  And once Chris sets out to find Annie, the movie starts to sound like a quest film (""these are your instructions, these are the rules""), but the action never takes off (he finds her and saves her in an inexplicably short time).  I will say the movie makes one think, if one hasn't already, about the nature of the afterlife, and it's great to look at, but it's very frustrating.  Funny that this movie is getting so many bad reviews; given that it seems pretty mainstream, it seems to have offended a lot of people.",What Dreams May Come

The film Being Human truly showed his dramatic range, while the linear plot and repetitive ""surprises"" in What Dreams May Come cheated him of a repeat performance.Like Twister, Dragonheart, Toy Story, and Tron, I was more impressed by the work of the post-production than I was of the material they had to work with",What Dreams May Come

This film was certainly not one of Robin Williams career highlights. It will never be able to stand up to ""Dead Poets Society"" or ""Good Will Hunting"".  The story just didn't hold together very well and the flashbacks became distracting.  The effects were good, but not good enough to save this film from failure.

Cuba Gooding's character comes off as subtly deceptive at first, but more open as the film moves on.  Annabella Sciorra's character could have been played up a bit more, but her on-screen presence is justified later in the film.  The lavish sets and use of color are probably the best I've seen, and don't lose much when translated to the small screen.

There is so much about this movie that I love. I have no idea how I actually ended up first watching it--might've been the fact that R. Williams is my love, mightn't have been--but, damn, am I glad I did.If you want to watch this movie, don't go into it expecting sunshine and roses and a typical love story that will you with happy tears in your eyes. There /will/ be tears in your eyes, but they'll be because of different, other, more significant reasons than just two individuals loving each other and all that jazz.This is a story about soul mates. About reincarnation. About family, and suicide, and depression. It's not a happy story. It starts with death, continues in death, and ends in death--and rebirth. It's the story of a man and a woman who love each other and who lose their kids to an accident; she becomes understandably depressed after that and their relationship goes all kind of wonky. The movie becomes really, really dark. There's depression, and suicidal thoughts, so if any of this is a trigger for you you shouldn't watch it. The suicidal thoughts turn to actual suicide later, after her man dies in another accident, leaving her alone the last member of her happy family. But this isn't /her/ story--it's her husband's, who dies and goes to heaven, finds his kids again and is able to communicate with his wife even in death through their special connection. Then he figures out she's committed suicide, and that she's in hell, and he wants to save her. Everyone warns him against it, and he almost loves himself in his mission, but it has a good, if sad, end.There are so many moments in the movie that just left me breathless and my chest aching.

And besides as if people would just give up on a loved one like that, I HIGHLY doubt that you were the first mr. williams. And besides that the films philosophy is that when you die you go to your most happy and comfortable place, mr. williams goes to his wife's painting, while his wife rots away in hell.I think if maybe they toned down on the family **** then this could of been a good movie, but it ended up just making me mad.",What Dreams May Come

I couldn't believe that they did that -- I have a feeling that that isn't in the book, although I haven't read it (and don't plan on it).To be perfectly honest, I didn't even like the SFX. They were obviously fake, with only a few scenes that looked real.

Ironically, even the people who fail to grasp the film are also eager to talk about it.  The number of comments on the IMDB is 278.  Enough said!The beginning of this film should be a guide for film students on how to bring the audience into a story in a very short period of time.  Almost like a trailer.  But there is no need to do in half an hour what was amazingly done in fifteen minutes.  This movie is an 800 lb gorilla in terms of drama, it grabs you before you can surrender, and wrings you out.

Other than these minor quibbles, I truly loved this movie, and have seen it three times and purchased the soundtrack.",What Dreams May Come

270,artriz,What was Robin Williams thinking?,1,28 December 1998,"I have been a fan of Robin Williams for quite sometime, and have very much enjoyed his performances in previous films.  This picture, however, was ridiculous. The portrayal of heaven as whatever the person wants it to be (and especially Robin's painted heaven) was beautiful, but other comments about heaven were senseless and idiotic. When asked about God, Cuba Gooding, Jr. says that ""He's up there somewhere"".  Up where? They're in HEAVEN!  I also found their idea of hell to be completely cliched and not in the least bit creative or smart.  I found myself perched on the edge of my seat, prepared to walk out at any moment as Robin stumbled across a sea of heads on his way to the flaming gates. In the end, a horrible film. Save your cash-- you'd have to PAY ME to see it again.",What Dreams May Come

As always, the realists took the film as a slap in the face.  It seems to be impossible for those that enjoy cynicism and brutality so much in film can never see the place for something to wander the more poetic paths.  If you can classify yourself as one of these people:  don't see it.  Otherwise, if you choose to see it, you'll probably enjoy hating it and join the ranks of people who simply need something to publicly whine about.  No, the movie is not for everyone, but I will say that it was for me.Robin Williams gives an (as always) triumphant performance that captures purely the essence of the film.  Of course, critics cannot stand to see that his talents can be so broad as to pull off the serious roles.  One would think that they would grow tired of whining over his steps out of their type-casting him in only light comedies.  A giant hoorah for his talent.One last comment on the film:  it is the greatest act of romantic arts since Jonathan Livington Seagull.",What Dreams May Come

There are things that I disagree with, most obviously that God is never mentioned in the whole film.  However, I can get past that and realize that it is a movie and not a sermon.Besides the theological dilemmas, I loved this movie.  I loved Robin Williams, I loved Scoccia.  I loved the idea of a love so strong that can transcend the grips of hell.  I loved the idea that we each create our own heaven and hell and choose to dwell in either.Very few movies haunt me.

I can clearly see that it is a fictional story. But it makes you think. What really does come after death? Do we just lie there and sleep? Or do we lie there and think? Or can we roam around on earth and still see people while they can't see us? Or do we really go to heaven? What are the rules of going to heaven though? Do we have to crime-free? Or suicide-free? It makes one think about life's meanings and what really comes after it. What really does come after life? Will we be able to see God?

Robin Williams of Jumanji is awesome in this romp. Annabella Sciorra was a poor choice, I feel, however, she does a good enough job.

The strange thing is that none of the reviews I read explained the main point of the movie.  The main ""message"" in the movie is that as human beings we are judged by our appearance and forced into a role whether we like it or not.Didn't anyone notice that no character's appearance in ""heaven"" matched their physical appearance on earth?  Robin Williams, (Chris), is the only exception.  They even mention this in the movie when Chris asks about it. ""The Son is sometimes the father, the daughter the mother, the student the teacher, sometimes our physical forms get in the way.""The movie is a sad movie, but it is happy in the end and is actually quite hopeful.The movie is good if you are open-minded.",What Dreams May Come

It is a wretched production meant to show a man in distress at loss of loved ones. Williams is very prone to sugar high sentimentality; it appears to be the book-end to his comic mania which is a real gift, ie fire 10 jokes in a minute and 5 will hit home. Vincent Ward must regret this one; Navigator was low key and much better. Avoid at all costs. It's a modern version of a weepie, and , it does not provide any of the insights such weepies are meant to contain as nuggets, so it's a dud.",What Dreams May Come

It doesn't get any better than this. The story is incredible, it really makes you think. Everything in this movie is just AMAZING, down to the last detail. I can't even say it enough. I own this movie and it is definitely one that I can watch over and over again without ever getting tired of. I can't possibly express in words how much I love this movie.

It will cause tears, laughs, and suspense. The characters are strong and there are very good actors. The scenes are beautiful and graphics are high quality. This is probably one of greatest films ever created. It can be watched and enjoyed over and over again. You can watch it and notice different things. This is definitely not a family film though.

Michael Kamen's score & the theme music are both memorable & touching as well.Yes, soul mates, rebirth etc, are romantic notions, but that's not the take home message. Even if there's no heaven, you will ask yourself what's your legacy?This film is a gem. It makes you think about our humanity, relationships & kindness. It makes you realise since we only spend a fraction of time on earth, we should make the most of it & be our authentic selves. Make a difference.Perhaps it's just a dream, an artist's interpretation, but this film sure sends a powerful message.I've really enjoyed it & own the DVD. I'm reserving 1 star for the bad hairdos.

The painting scene towards the start of the film is spectacular. There are some new ideas in this film and some spins off old ideas, specifically Dante's Inferno.  In Canto 13, in the lower levels of hell, reside the people who commit suicide, della vigna (Enclosed in new bodies, as trees and bushes in a black, tangled wood).  Gorgeous imagery.  This is a MUST see film for any spiritual person.

288,dave_minall,A Stunning film with a stunning soundtrack to boot,9,27 January 2009,"What dreams may come may come across as being a bit too serious for its own good, when in fact it is a basic love story that emphasizes the lengths that people will go to for love. I personally think this is one of my favorite films due to the sheer emotion that is portrayed.Without giving anything away, I was moved to tears on no less than 8 times during the course of this film. The chemistry between Robin Williams and Annabella Sciorra is magical, I was often in disbelief of whether their love for each other was purely for the film or whether it was actually for real. this only heightens the emotions that you will feel when watching the film, for I for one felt more connected with the characters, because in reality everybody would want a love that was as strong as this.The movie takes a semi-chaotic roller-coaster through Chris Nielsen (Robin Williams) version of heaven, and he soon realizes that his wife has committed suicide and has been banished to hell as a result of this. Chris then decides to commit the impossible and to bring her back.As I stated the film made me cry numerous times, and still continues to whenever I watch it.The acting is incredibly good, with exceptional performances from Robin W, and Cuba Gooding Jnr. and the score is out of this world. A previous soundtrack was rejected, in favor of Michael Kamen's version, which I do believe to be a modern masterpiece. Michael and Mich Hucknell's (Simply Red) version of ""Beside you"" is simply stunning.9 out of 10 from me, as I rate this film to be exceptional, I hope you feel the same.Dave",What Dreams May Come

290,daygc,Dream on!,2,27 August 2004,"I'm not quite sure what director Vincent Ward was going for here, although I do know what he missed:1) Acting talent. Although Robin Williams and Cuba Gooding, Jr. have turned in excellent performances elsewhere (""One Hour Photo"" and ""Radio"" respectively), they didn't deliver here. Williamss giddy idiocy in his own personal ""Heaven"", were too nauseating to watch. Gooding was positively imbecilic in his portrayal of Williams' guiding spirit. Annabella Sciorra was passable as Chris Nielsen's (Williams) long-suffering wife, and the dead-daughter-turned-Asian-flight-attendant (Rosalind Chao), was cute enough and had a very infectious laugh. But in the end, there just isn't enough talent to go around, and even if there was, there isn't much of a script to work with.2) Special effects (lack of.) I can hear the howls of protest already: ""It was supposed to be ARTISTIC and SURREAL"", not packed with the razzle-dazzle of modern computer pyrotechnics. Granted. But these, ahem, effects, were positively lame. The stomping-through-the-wet-paint-in-the-painting scenes were almost unbearable - like watching two hours of ""Blue's Clues."" The people who were flying around in Leona's ""Heaven"" were just as silly - reminded me of the monkeys in the ""Wizard of Oz."" 3) ""Plot."" OK - I'll let Ford have a small amount of leeway on this, but even that isn't enough to make up for the storyline's inherent anemia. It's a New Ager's cornucopia of afterlife musings, none of which seem to make any sense. Ford's avoidance of endorsing any particular belief system about the afterlife is ultimately what causes the plot to implode. The whole idea of the rescue from ""Hell"" (which we ""might"" call it, according to Leona) just doesn't cut it. ""Rambo"" was more believable - for that matter, so was ""Alien 3"", Ward's 1992 previous storyline effort.Do yourself a favor - skip this one. I wish I did.",What Dreams May Come
291,jesse-reinhard,"Thought provoking, but lacked decent storytelling.",6,29 October 2013,"Definitely made to be a romance, but I got more out of it for its philosophical depictions of heaven that probably would appease to multiple beliefs. As well as a classic depiction of hell, definitely some inspiration from Dante's Inferno. The movie didn't have enough time to explore all the philosophical possibilities for heaven, probably for the better because I felt it was already trying to cram in storytelling.It felt very fast paced in establishing the relationship then immediately jumping to the tragedies. Then once Robin Williams is in heaven, they have to keep doing flashbacks throughout the movie, and keep introducing plot points right up to the end. What irked me the most was perhaps how no one appeared to be who they really were in heaven, part of being who you literally want to be. But it didn't really matter that they kept changing identities because their characters were underdeveloped and you don't associate them well with how they looked when they were alive anyway.6.5/10",What Dreams May Come

People don't like it because for some reason taking Robin Williams seriously is not tolerable for critics. Robin Williams does a FANTASTIC JOB! Anyone that doesn't enjoy this movie clearly can't feel for the characters and wasn't paying attention. The depiction of heaven even for a 1998 film is incredible.

This movie is selfless for the eyes of the audience. It will transform you , if you let it. The story is the gravitational point that leads the viewer deeper into the real beauty of the film. The film focuses on change from loss and how the characters deal with it. This can seem boring to some, however the story keeps moving you right along to the point you feel right with every scene. You will be waiting to see what happens. This move is not for everyone, I think it is for those that like a deep story root and some unexpected twists. However, the darkness in this film does and will surface for the viewer, which is not a bad thing. I think the movie waits for you to be ready for the next scene and it sort of prepare's you emotionally. I like this about the film because otherwise it would seem rushed and the point of the story would be missed. A genuine movie that I think hits all the marks and does get stuck sometimes with focusing too much on emotional aspects.

The problem with What Dreams May Come is that there is so often these emotional scenes of embracing one's spirit and rejecting the illusion and limitations that life puts on you while reinforcing those same limitations, the movie can be hard to swallow.

The internal contradictions of reincarnation plus heaven or hell are made even more confusing by the addition of symbolism drawn from classic Greek mythology. Max Von Sydow recreates his role of Father Merrin, thinly disguised as Charon the boatman who conveys Robin Williams (playing Orpheus) across the river Styx, past the 3 headed dog Cerberus (now a ship of the same name) in search of his wife Eurydice.

What surprised me was the terrible ""acting"" and poor writing. The dialogue in this movie has to be among the worst I have seen in a major motion picture - lots of cliches and catch-phrases thrown around with no purpose, except to sound 90's. And no one, not even Robin Williams, betrays for one moment that they really believe what they are portraying or that any of it means anything. Finally, to the visual element in this movie. That was the primary reason why I went to see it, having read many glowing reviews that praised the visual aspects. That was the most surprising disappointment of all. Very few of the visuals struck me as remarkable or original. Even the scenes in ""hell"" were flat and uninvolving.If anything positive can be said about this movie, it would be that it might deter someone from committing suicide. Although even there I wonder how strong a deterrent it would be, since it seems that suicides can wish themselves out of ""hell""! The whole aspect of the wife's rescue from ""hell"" is poorly written and very unconvincing - unless it was ""all in the mind"", as one of the most oft-repeated catch-phrases in this movie might lead us to believe.I can't give this movie more than a 3.",What Dreams May Come

This film was easily one of last year's best pictures and rightfully deserves its Academy Award nod for Art Direction (what happened to Cinematography?). This was an extremely thought-provoking movie, just the kind lacking in a year bombarded with mediocre scripts. It is a story about life-after-death with one central theme, ""love never dies"".

It was a little different than any movie I've seen in the recent past and am likely to see in the near future.The premise behind the movie is that if you die, your soul goes to a a spirit world where your desires are translated to reality. However, those who commit suicide are doomed to keep wallowing in the same misery that drove them to suicide in the first place.Williams portrays a man who has lost his children, and 4 years later, himself is killed in a car accident. He discovers the delightful world of life after death. He soon learns that his widow (played by Sciorra, who you may recognize if you caught the excellent psychological thriller Whispers in the Dark) has committed suicide and is doomed to eternal despair. Williams sets out to save his wife from this fate, which he is told that no one has ever done before.It seems like a little more work on the screenplay might have helped the movie over the top. The performances Williams and Sciorra turn in are sincere, but it seems like the lines could have been better written. The beginning of the movie seems a little rushed, and the same plot device (no spoilers here) is used regarding three different characters from Chris' (Williams) life: the scene with his daughter goes off well, but the same technique wears thin the third time around. Finally, it seems as if the climactic scene could have been made more poignant and powerful than it was.Still, if you are looking for a movie that isn't cut from the same mold as so many other recent movies, this may be the ticket.",What Dreams May Come

While I think the acting was stale at times (it wasn't that bad) and some of the dialogue sounded like it was taken out of the narrated, non-spoken lines in the novel (all of which were needed to explain what was going on at times), this movie is still an amazing movie, and brings out new ideas regarding ""the afterlife.""

There was a lot of potential to make this film great in many other ways besides the special effects.  But in the end, I was very disappointed.The first turning point of the film occurred at about ten minutes in the story line.  Everything that happened in the first ten minutes came at you in warp speed, and you never really had the chance to get to know the main characters all that well.  This was supposed to be a love story that continues even after death, but the viewer really needs to get inside the characters mind long enough to feel sympathy for Annie when she is faced with tragedies.  It seemed like the directors wanted the viewers to see the special effects and didn't trust that anyone would really believe in the characters in the first place!  The viewer has to believe in the characters in a story like this.The viewer does see some important moments that happened in the life of Annie and Chris, some obstacles that stood in the way of their dreams.  But the viewer sees these in numerous flashbacks which only weighed the story down.  The flashbacks were distracting and the plot didn't move very well.The movie needed better editing.

332,chicago3-1,"Robin Williams journeys to hell to save his wife, who is in hell for having committed suicide.",3,6 April 2007,"Overall, I found this movie somewhat flat. It is a very somber and melancholy film. It is about death and a family torn apart by grief. The characters are very solemn. Be prepared for this. If you are not in the right mood, this is not the movie to watch. Still, I just found this family very dull to begin with. First, Robin Williams dies and awakens in a utopian after-life where he can manipulate scenery through his imagination. This sets the stage for the breathtaking imagery and scenery. This is definitely one aspect of the film worth looking at, the visuals. Excellent use of visuals was made in weaving the allegory. I thought that Robin Williams and Sciorra were a little distant and too intellectual when they should have been more playful and carefree with each other. The family did not seem authentic in their earth life. It seemed picture-perfect and idyllic upper middle-class family but neither their affection nor their family problems seemed genuine and candid. Many of the scenes of Williams and his wife seem somewhat clichéd and mawkish- they meet on pretty lake set against the Swiss alps during a leisurely getaway, they lie down and gaze at the cloud, making up names and shapes, and ugh, I just wanna vomit. Furthermore, the cause for relational disharmony is also very weak. For example, one of the issues that seems to cause friction is William's pressure on his son to succeed in school, and Sciorra is too caught up in her career life too be able to drive the children personally to school (so that they end up in an accident with someone else driving the kids). It is also William's desire to support his grieving wife that compels him to take a trip (for some paintings she needs at her art exhibit) that eventually results in his losing his life. I thought it could have been better demonstrated that there were tensions, misaligned priorities, secular distraction, and so forth. This just didn't come through. I guess this could be a matter of interpretation. It is also the case that the more idyllic they are shown, the more dramatic is the grief that they suffer.During the ending, there could have been more drama in Williams' psychological struggle to keep his sanity and avoid sharing in his wife's fate. It turned out just to be normal family conversation. I thought it would have been better if William's character were shown enjoying himself in heaven but then being torn between staying in heaven and going to get his wife. The director instead took another route, with Williams being fiercely determined and steadfast in his desire to be with his wife. I think it would have been better to have Williams dealing with internal conflict about going into hell or not. The journey didn't seem to really build up in suspense or anticipation. He couldn't recognized his own children in heaven-that would seem to lessen the likelihood of his own wife recognizing him in hell (I could infer that), but I didn't really get a sense of the challenge involved in Williams going to get his wife. Although there was the unravelling of his children's' identities which sort of built up the expectation that he would eventually get to this wife. Also, I thought that Sciorra could have played a more distraught person whose life has been shattered by death.A major theme is that people carry over much of their attachments from their lives on Earth, which subsequently continues to mold their perception of reality in this after-life. It turns out to be somewhat of a mixed blessing. On the one hand, people have the freedom to construct fanciful and enjoyable creatures and scenery. On the other, they have trouble recognizing people for who they really are because they continue to construct reality based on their own preconceptions. Yet this very sOn the one hand, it seems interesting that in heaven we would have the opportunity to understood people for who they really are and not according to our superficial judgments or our desires and expectations. I appreciate that the director didn't get too philosophical but instead focused on the characters and their lives.",What Dreams May Come

But I watched it because it was recommended on a online grief support group. When I saw that it had Robin Williams in it, I had high hopes because I consider him to be talented and have liked most of the movies I've seen him in.Then I read the plot summary on IMDb and Wikipedia and the movie sounded absolutely awful. But, I thought I'd keep an open mind and give it a try.Before long, I had the uncomfortable feeling that this would be like all those sappy Lifetime Network made-for-TV movies. The plot was simplistic and the character development was nil. Still, I held out hope.If ""Heaven"" is anything like the juvenile portrayal depicted in this movie, I think I'll opt for the other place. People floating around doing nothing identifiable? Please! Then there's the whole ""suicide victims go to hell"" stereotype that is ignorant and cruel.Seriously - this movie was a total waste of time.

What really captured me, however,  was the construction of the storyline; the way it spoke so accurately to the way life can unfold so inexplicably.What Dreams May Come, was the most sincere, emotionally arresting attempt at illustrating the love and longing that a human being can experience that I have ever seen on screen. Robin Williams' character happens upon a very happy life - a valued, promising career; wonderful, intelligent children; a loving, beautiful wife; but most importantly, true love.  He has everything only to have it torn from him.  Yet, in the midst of his losses, he never loses his adoration for his wife.  He sets aside his needs, his pain, everything for the love he holds in his heart...through life and beyond.  Ultimately, he willingly charges forward through Heaven and Hell to do the utterly impossible, with every indication that he will fail, in order to come to the aid of his wife.
This was a story about a love that could not be quelled by anyone, for anything, in any world.  This is the love we all want to find, and some lucky people (like myself) manage to find and feel for their loved ones so overwhelmingly that it makes you want to cry.",What Dreams May Come

Eduardo Serra's cinematography is simply brilliant. Breathtaking comes to mind. This film is beautiful to both the eyes, and to the soul. It's finely acted by Williams, Von Sydow, and Gooding Jr, (I feel Annabella Sciorria was trying too hard and it showed)and is genuinly sweet. This movie couldn't build suspense the general way, by putting the characters lives in danger, (they are after all, already dead) but it manages to get it there regardless.

Several years ago I picked up the book for a re-read and found it trite, unimaginative and sexist. Both responses were honest and real, but from different life/time perspectives. The same could be true for this movie. Only to those of us ""jaded"" by the genre would this film seem silly and less than spectacular. I think the movie was beautiful. It is sappy, true, but sap is what keeps old and young trees alive. When our society becomes too ""sophisticated"" to enjoy a good old fashioned sappy love story it is evidence of a withering soul. Time to stop and smell the roses again.... Or in this case, get back to the art museum and spend some solitary hours moving inside the paintings again, like you did when you were younger and more amazed at the talents and visions of the world.",What Dreams May Come

354,Trigger-9,Yawn,3,25 November 1998,"Don't take any sleep inducing pills before seeing this one or you may never wake up.  And don't get any candy either because 30 minutes of this is enough to make you diabetic.What do we have here?  An impossibly wonderful husband gets killed (trying to save someone else's life of course.  Oh, and while he's on an errand for his dumb wife that he generously offered to do.  Oh and after saving a poor girl from a childhood of misunderstanding by correctly diagnosing her migraine headaches instead of writing her off as a stupid kid) and his stupid wife can't take it so she kills herself and winds up in hell.  Mr. Wonderful is in heaven but decides he's gonna get his wife there too, because, dammit, he's just so Wonderful.  Conveniently, since most of the movie is in heaven, the screenwriter can make up whatever ad hoc rules he needs to to see to it that Mr. Wonderful is successful.  And I say he, because the male Robin Williams character is so perfect and such a thinly disguised allusion to Jesus and his female wife is so clearly the wretched, stupid sinner that the screenwriter had to have been male.Back to the movie, Mr. Wonderful has some saccharine sweet reunions in heaven with everyone he ever loved (dog, kids, etc.) and then decides to give it all up to go to hell to be with the dumb wife.  Somehow his self scarifice magically gets both of them in to heaven (see the Jesus angle there?). Shockingly the movie has a happy ending with everyone enjoying the wonderfulness of heaven together  Was Michael Landon involved in this project somehow?  Makes me want to go right out and kill myself to get there all the sooner.  Whoops!  Can't do that, apparently that's the one thing that gets you in to hell.I had hoped for a romantic love story about two lovers's courageous struggle to be together.  Instead, we have Robin Williams playing such a Great and Wonderful Guy doing all the hard work to save his idiotic, pitiful wife that you begin to wonder if Robin is simply a ridiculous egomaniac who didn't care what schlock got put up on screen as long as he ended up looking good. Romantic love stories work when the two characters are equals and both have to overcome their flaws to be together.  This relationship was so lopsided it gets annoying.And there was no Devil!  How can you have a movie about heaven and hell with no Devil?  Movies with the Devil in them are usually fun because a screenwriter can get really creative with the Devil as a character.  You can have him do anything!  I think if there had been some blow-out fight scene with the Devil in it (see South Park) at the end that would have made it much more entertaining.The special effects in the movie were extensive and reasonably good.  Hell was kind of dorky, reminded me too much of the oil tanker in Water World. And in heaven, everyone seemed to just dress up in period costumes and either float around or play hopscotch on this strange staircase in to the water.  Weird.I have a hard time recommending this movie to anyone but the most devout Kathie Lee Gifford fans (just seems like her style).  Robin Williams fans will be disappointed and his trend of playing heroic figures of ever more increasing Terrificness (Dead Poets Society, Cadillac Man, Awakenings, Good Will Hunting and now this) is starting to get a bit disturbing.  I think Robin is a tremendous comedian and actor, but he's going a bit overboard lately.  The movie makes you feel good at a superficial level, but feels smarmy and leaves you feeling manipulated upon reflection.-Trigger",What Dreams May Come

It had a great ambiance (at times), ambition, very good potential, and one of the best tries I've seen to separate the afterlife from religious paraphernalia. Unfortunately, it fails. The pace of the movie is all messed up, it goes through severe mood swings without much reason and suffers of an excess of melodrama. Even an interesting plot twist is repeated and overused... This movie is seriously warped, and I don't think it's intentional, not mostly, at least. Not in the content, but everything else; I came out of the theater seriously thinking the director should see a psychiatrist on a regular basis. But perhaps that is a good point...Overall: worth seeing, one of the few surrealist movies there are. Good spots here and there.

Meanwhile, despite entirely undeveloped characters, we're supposed to scorn Chris Nielsen for hiding his grief, even though we never, ever see this because we hardly even see the characters anywhere but post-mortem. And what is the ill-cast Cuba Gooding Jr. doing in this movie? In heaven, apparently, deception is the norm, as Chris Nielsen's kids appear before him disguised as other people -- just so ""issues"" can be raised, as though heaven is just another form of therapy.

It seemed all so wise as to be familiar... perhaps something of deja vu...At the risk of sending you, the reader, the wrong message, this film lays on a very heavy message so gently, something like a ""sympathy card"" from a loving friend who *knows* something, perhaps an angel...For anyone who appreciates imagination, who wonders about life (its meaning, its end, its truths), who loves art & how it touches us & why, who loves friendship & a life full of loving & loved things...

Fluffy folk just won't get it.  I think this movie is unfortunately before it's time for many people, and if those viewers find this movie depressing or confusing, I suggest they try it again later after they have gone through some of life's angst and conquered some inner demons of their own (and you will!)  When you have, you will find this movie absolutely spiritually uplifting and empowering, which will stay with you for days & days afterwards, touching your very soul.  It's that profound.I highly recommend this movie to those people who have experienced some of life's hard knocks and always try to find the deeper reason as to why we are here on earth, and what life is all about.  There is more to life than celebrities, beauty, fancy clothes, and all that fluff.  This movie effectively addresses those important issues, and gives an incredibly symbolic & artistic interpretation of one couple's enduring love to overcome any obstacles in life or even death.  As a woman who has faced her own mortality and is fortunate enough to have a truly devoted loving husband who has stayed by her side through it all, I know this type of true love exists. Those who don't will likely scoff or resent this intense display of emotion; but instead I hope they will decide this type of unconditional supportive love is what they deserve, and insist upon it for themselves.The actors are inspired, and I cannot possibly say enough about Robin William's remarkable acting.  He was stunning and left me very impressed, even more so than in his movies ""Awakenings"" or ""Patch Adams.""  Cuba Gooding Jr. is now a favorite actor of mine too, after seeing his wonderful performance in this movie.Spiritual seekers and anyone who believes true love does exist, don't miss this movie!

The height of joys and the depth of sorrow are faithfully played-out by the characters (particularly by the lead, Robin Williams).Although it's just a ""story"" and it no obligation at all to HAVE to match-up to MY own concepts of ""how things really are"", the depiction of Heaven did not meet my expectations.  It left the place seeming too  ""etherial"" as if it were some place ""made-up"" only in the mind of (the character), someone who might actually be existing there all alone. The depiction of Hell, however, just blew me away.  It soooo very well captured my concept of what the place must be like; a frightening place to enter in; a place where agony of the human soul reigns in so many forms.This movie pulls at your emotions, first from one side, taking you heights of fulfilled happiness and joy; then it draws you down to actually feel along with the characters the deep sorrows of depression.  However, the story keeps you moving through in an intriguing way so that you can never feel ""stuck"" in any of those places. In the end, as you always hoped it would be, it's a ""feel-good-movie"".

It is great to watch the art in this movie evolve and to see how it effected the characters with the use of color. Although the overall mood is a melancholy one, it uses that feeling to give the viewer the chance or the initiative to fight for the things they might need to change or improve in their own lives.I guess it is a big display of the never ending fight of good and evil; even if it is the struggle of our own good and evil or rights and wrongs.Roni",What Dreams May Come

WDMC manages to answer our curiosity about life after death in a most interesting way -- here is heaven on film.  We are talking more than just white clouds here, in fact the deep textures keep us afloat in a very real, other-worldly vision while we wonder what we will see next. This film challenges too many belief systems (especially fundamental) and therefore will most likely become an under-rated classic.While the characters are thick, morose, sometimes sappy, the cast is an excellent choice.  Although Robin Williams is the lead character, he, nor Cuba Gooding Jr. overshadows any of the others.  The actors are the ""gods"" of this film.  Sometimes the screenplay runs a little long however, each character is truly believable against the settings and situations.  The script, a beautiful interpretation of the Richard Matheson novel,  demands a little ""faith"" from the audience.While you are in it, the film is so fantastic that you are challenged to believe what you see.  I wondered if anyone would believe it as a good script.  But when you get away from WDMC and start thinking about it, more is revealed as the entire concept becomes clear and enjoyable in your mind. Not that I would want to sit through it again but rather, I prefer to remember it.  WDMC is a cerebral film that warrants it purpose.Probably over the heads of most audiences; on a Saturday night at prime time, opening weekend, in a popular city theater, the place was only half full.

It deals with the true, raw passion that two people in love (soul-mates in particular) go through in both happy and trying times.  It conveys the true meaning of ""eternal love"". The characterization of the Nielsen's is entirely three dimensional and totally realistic-Chris loves his family, he's hard on his children but remorseful about that; he also loves being a doctor and is incredibly caring and gentle with his patients as well as his family for the most part; stubborn; and of course, he is incredibly attuned to and in love with his wife.  Annabella Sciorra, as always, is beautiful in the film, both as a young woman full of light and hope and older when she is depressed and angry, though always loving her husband and her children.The film adequately depicts my conceptions of what Heaven and Hell will be like.  The vibrant colors in Heaven aren't gaudy or splashy but absolutely beautiful.  I would buy every single still in those scenes as a piece of art complete unto itself.  Absolutely beautiful, and it looks completely real, amazingly enough.  Hell is not the Hell I've seen in other films, but more like my conception, as I've said.  Dark, dismal, sad, depressing, and scary, but not any scarier than what Annie was going through on Earth, except that it was eternal. It showed what people remember in vivid detail is not always memories the people in those memories will have, but if you love each other then your love can transcend any bounds, physical or spiritual, and that if you're good, people will love, remember, and cherish you as much as you loved, remembered, and cherished them.

I actually thought about leaving the theater (something I've never done).If you want to see this film, my advice would be to wait and rent it.  Put the tape in your VCR, kill the TV volume, then put your favorite CD in so you can watch the amazing spectacle of ""What Dreams May Come"" in peace.",What Dreams May Come

As a story, it is as masterful a re-telling of an ancient myth as I have ever experienced, and as skillful a weaving of archetypes. Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell must be pleased, wherever they now exist, with this movie. Honestly and touchingly acted,and emotionally involving, still it is the cinematography andthe incredible use of art and color that make this movie one of the most unique and awe-inspiring cinematic events I havepersonally witnessed in a lifetime of loving movies.",What Dreams May Come

The characters were hollow despite the constant efforts to build them up. You don't care if they live or die, and after hearing the same lines of dialogue over and over again, I felt like I was in hell! The movie's contrived vision of heaven was just plain silly (imagine looking at a computer graphic for the entire length of the movie) and used often for only comic value. A big disappointment of a movie whose exciting premise is left to flounder in a sea of digital paint.",What Dreams May Come

Everything from set design, special effects, costumes and location shooting helped to build a unique and strong story and push it into sharp relief.  While some may balk at the plot and others may complain that the pace was slow, it is truly a work that must be viewed for its cinamatography alone.  And don't feel bad if you cry.  Many did.",What Dreams May Come

I walked in ready to love this film, to be moved, to be amazed. Instead, I was surprised to find myself very bored. The characters are either explaining life, explaining how heaven works or spouting platitudes about feelings. Even the special effects grew tiresome. I wasn't the only person sighing with frustration in the theater. This has the dreamy distance of an art film, without the depth. If you want heaven and hell, read Dante.",What Dreams May Come

""It was like sitting through a 2 hour Hallmark Card"" was how a friend described it while leaving the advanced screening we saw.  It looks beautiful & the visual effects were wonderful, but thats all I can say good about it.  It seems like just another bad story with great effects that we have been bombarded with lately.

Pretty to look at but shallow.  Kind of like if you bye a piece of fudge, and eat too much thus making you sick.  Robin Willams was outstanding as always.

I feel sorry for those whose vision and range of depth stops here.This is the most amazing movie I have seen in years. It captures one's senses, emotions, and mind....and lingers on in one's presence long after the movie ends.

It breaks the rules like Bach did with music. Also, now that special effects are humdrum and everyday in commericals, it seems that in film they might have to have more meaning and depth to capture the imagination.

I don't want to reveal too much, but the essence is that in the face of death, love still prevails.

410,ishi,Boring.,1,5 October 1998,"For a film that ran just over an hour and a half---it seemed like an eternity.  Even Titanic with its epic length at least kept me awake, although I felt it to be just as sappy.  The director created a visually impressive movie that fell short on acting and storyline.  Much of the dialogue seems redundant and is delivered in an unconvincing manner that fails to match the intensity of the visuals.  I just got back from seeing it and I can't remember one good line from the film.  The film is also disappointing in that it misses the opportunity to explore controversial issues surrounding the afterlife.  They conveniently side-step the question of whether or not this is the Christian version of heaven after they explicitly outline reasons for being sent to hell.  Cerberus from Greek lore is also mentioned as guarding the entrance to hell (not Hades)  which further smears the continuity of the film.  Perhaps they didn't want to offend any particular belief by neglecting to give an honorable mention---even a dog gets into heaven (I thought they weren't allowed in). Many reviews I've read claim that it is a deep and thought provoking movie with much merit.   Perhaps I slept through those parts.  Despite its intentions, the scope of the film is quite narrow and can't be redeemed by all the FX in the world.",What Dreams May Come

Spare me the new age drivel, please!  It plods along, at best, and though the special effects really are special, they can't make up for a forced plot with no real surprises in it. Hell looks like that port city in India (?) where old ships are dismantled. Bet the movie gets great reviews when it gets to their town.  Hell should have been represented as a darkened movie theater, 25 minutes into the show, where you continually realize you still have 85 minutes to go.",What Dreams May Come
415,StarFort,actual film student's review from The North Carolina School of The Arts,10,6 October 1998,"It is a masterpiece. It is an epic. It is a work of art like none I have ever seen. What Dreams May Come is an Oscar contender. A film with true form, a perfectly executed setup, climax, and resolution. The director's use of color is incredible, going far beyond the hinted shades and occasional slathering of Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. This film is nothing if not well executed. The experience is so intense that I do not think anyone can walk out of the theater unchanged. It may be questioned why this film deserves so much praise. Simply examining the backbone talent involved is an unmistakable clue to the destined success of this film.The film stars Robin Williams, a three-time nominee for Best Actor. He won Best Supporting Actor in 1997. Five time Golden Globe winner, plus four other nominations. ShoWest Male Star of The Year 1994. He is one of Hollywood's most decorated veterans and one of America's favorite stars. From his beginnings as ""Popeye"" and ""Mork"" to his great triumphs in Dead Poets Society, Jack, Hook, Aladdin, Good Morning, Vietnam, and Good Will Hunting, he is our perfect unsinkable warm-hearted hero.Williams' co-star is fellow Best Supporting Actor winner, Cuba Gooding, Jr. His believability in the role is outstanding, a lesser thespian could not have pulled it off. A complete departure from his part in Jerry McGuire, Gooding has done it again, bringing to life a tortured soul, he pulls off a magnificent performance that screams to be discussed on the ride home.The director of this heavenly cinematic tour de force is Vincent Ward, a man who began as an art director in 1979, and worked up to writing and directing Vigil, 1984's dark exploration of how children deal with their parents' deaths. In 1988 he wrote and directed The Navigator: A Medieval Odyssey, a low budget epic which veteran critic Leonard Maltin described as, ""[An] engrossing, very imaginative tale. . . directed and written with great clarity, the film has much the feel of a genuine medieval fable."" He went on to write, direct, and produce Map of The Human Heart, an unsuccessfully marketed dream-tale of a boy out of place. In 1992 he wrote the story for Alien 3, the death scene of one of science fiction's greatest heroines, Sigourney Weaver's ""Ripley."" Ward is a man who knows the many faces of death, love, and fear, and has proven he can show them on film.The novel on which the screenplay was based was written by Richard Matheson, the man who, among his many other chilling tales, wrote the stories and screenplays for The Incredible Shrinking Man, Twilight Zone: The Movie, and The Omega Man. A powerful soothsayer of death and madness who always gives hope in the end.The producer and screen-writer is none other than Ronald Bass, a man behind the curtain on some of the last decade's most celebrated films. Rain Man, How Stella Got Her Groove Back, My Best Friend's Wedding, The Joy Luck Club, Waiting to Exhale, and Dangerous Minds. This is a man who knows how to support a director, how to get things done in the background without going over budget, and how to tell a character driven story on the big screen.Digital Domain is James Cameron's Industrial Light and Magic. With their recent successes in Titanic, Blade, and Luc Besson's The Fifth Element, plus the visual champagne of What Dreams May Come, the D2 team seems to be destined to take ILM's throne. There is no doubt that they worked long hours to get this film done. As a student of film-making I was impressed with how well the visuals fit the story. As a professional computer artist I don't know how they did half of the stuff in that movie.So, you can see the power behind this film, now I suggest you go sit in front of it in a theater.

I could easily conclude from the previews that the concept did involve the main character leaving heaven to be with his wife--of course, in the previews it wasn't evident where exactly she was, but regardless of that, I thought the idea that heaven just wasn't good enough for him was not only idiotic, but blasphemous. In certain moments, I could see a flicker of hope, but it was alwaysimmediately contradicted with a ridiculous, offending, and overactedcontinuation.  I found Robin Willaims to be fabulous in Good Will Hunting, but this, leaving not only heaven, the ultimate paradise, but also his children behind to find your bland and depressing wife in hell just doesn't sound like the most intelligent decision to me.

The image of hell was (at least visually) impressive.  It accomplished the bitter under-flavor that is usually to intriguing in those dishes that purposely use contrasting sensations (ie, fried ice cream or sweet and sour sauce).  But the sweet side of this ""bittersweet"" concoction was so sickingly rich, repleat with trite images mixed with concepts so innovative as to be no less than sappy (walking in paint?) that the intended tease of a well done recipe was totally lost.It is sad that I watched a film where hell was more interesting to live in that heaven.....poor Robin.",What Dreams May Come

It is an astonishing peek into the brain of someone who has not progressed beyond the Sunday-school images of the first grade, and who has absorbed all the psychobabble b.s. that Cosmo can offer. And as film-making, it has no pace whatsoever. It is one long unrelieved stare into each others eyes.

436,Mann-2,A great Jungian approach,10,3 June 1999,"As a moviegoer I consider this movie a masterpiece. As a curious reader of the human use of symbols I was delighted. It took me a while to grasp this content but I was twice as happy when I did. I hope for the writer's and for the director's sake that they didn't expect less than the harsh critic they received. If their goal was portraying a dream narrated from a Jungian psychic model standpoint then they may be satisfied. Though their Egos may hurt a little I'm pretty sure their own Selves are quite satisfied with the gift they gave us. A writer fumbling with this topic can never forget that the Anima shall ever remain unconscious by definition. As a matter of fact I realize that this very essay is not going to reach but a few hands, and that's how it shall be.An interesting comment I found rummaging on the Internet was a memory dedicated to the film My Life . The commentator made a good comparison with What dreams may come but I will further his attempt by saying that this second movie was an unsuccessful attempt by the main character to cross the chasm. True enough, in My Life the main character wasn't allowed by the script's creator to engage in a new conscious-unconscious wedlock that would allow him to pursue life renewed and refreshed as in What dreams may come . In the same line of thought and given the ample spectrum of human experience in other movies like The War of the Roses , the Anima doesn't take any chances, takes full revenge and finally succeeds in destroying the male Ego figure. In this last tale it is not surprising that the main character is portrayed as a narrator and that the death of the male/female figures is described as a fall from their home's highest chandelier. But that is another movie.If the writer/director intended to pursue an intellectual adventure by bringing to conscience the contents of a dream and share a trend of thought known to a few then the subtitle to the movie: "" After life there is more "" is definitely a misleading one. The title probably comes from Shakespeare's musings on death in Hamlet , Act III, Scene 1: ""For in that sleep of death / what dreams may come / when we have shuffled / off this mortal coil, / Must give us pause."" And that pause is not to be found in a sturdy structured intellectual comprehension of images but rather in a flowing holistic condition that takes us to enjoy or reject the set of symbols that come to us during our lifetimes.This movie may be a great example of unconsciousness protecting its kingdom. It is no wonder the Greek mythology already realized that Sleep and Death were brothers. Who knows if the producers themselves couldn't interpret the title as it is, What dreams may come ... obtaining from the audience the feedback they precisely did. Dreams are to remain dreams and no matter how much of an effort is made to standardize their infinite content or to comprehend that there is such thing as the collective unconsciousness, we share an infinite world filled with symbols and human experience. And we won't be able to apprehend all of its content and thus achieve such a precious crown for our intellect. The experience beyond tangible and measurable reality remains as individual as it is by definition and infinite beyond understanding and that should never be forgotten.",What Dreams May Come
437,adamsays,Eye candy or I can die (knowing that films don't come any worse).,1,7 January 1999,"It's a rare thing to feel embarrassed leaving a cinema - but that was my reaction after sitting right through one of the most nauseating, boring, unfulfilling films I've ever seen.The writing was on the wall with the saccharine opening of bumping boats on a Swiss lake  (why Switzerland? beats me!) and a ""mountain meeting"" scene that could have been conjured from an erotic fantasy version of Wuthering Heights.  Then there was a mercifully high-speed review of a ""perfect"" family forming, only to be interrupted by the central tragedies of the children's deaths soon followed by that of the husband (Robin Williams). All of which, in the absence of any substantial character development, would have left us cold - if it weren't for the sentimental speeches and over-blown musical score which heralded and underlined every essential moment of the film.In heaven the rot really set in, with overblown special effects and surging symphonic passages trying hard to overcome the ""zero"" story-line.  After much traipsing through the flowers of paradise's imaginary pallet we reached the nub of the story with the earthly suicide of the wife.At last, a good 45 minutes into the film, the plot emerged: an old fashioned ""search and rescue"" mission set in cyber-heaven.  But what a miserable mission: a search emasculated of any dramatic tension by the fact that the protagonist is already dead (but living well in paradise) - so what has he to lose?  what threat has to be survived?  It's a case of ""have Robin Williams, will travel"" on a tour through a bizarre series of sets and special effects, including Hell dressed up as a burning boat (was this something picked up from Titanic's cutting room floor?)  And a rescue so bland and predictable that it wilted on the flacid vine; and the resultant reunification of family was as cloying and sick-making as the cheapest brand of ersatz champagne.OK so there were a few stunning images that brought to mind Terry Gilliam's work (although without the wit or bite), but these didn't compensate for the crass dialogue and laboured direction.  In any event, they were undermined by some sinister undertones in the film.   Such as the large proportion of black people inside the burning gates of Hell contrasting with the white faces in Heaven; and the idea that suicide is in all cases irredeemable, but for the rest of us there is a better life to be had after we are dead.So sorry to all of you who thought this was such a great film - for me it was drivel of the worst kind: a simple story dumbed down and painted up - a thin (very thin) veneer of ""eye candy"" and nothing more.",What Dreams May Come
438,Pete_C,Oh dear...,2,9 January 1999,"It's been a long time since I've heard a cinema vibrate with derisory laughter, but the final scenes of this movie clinched it.What a shallow, one-note, one-pace mess.Third-hand visuals borrowing from Renaissance art borrowing from Dante. Third-rate acting from God-knows where, all in tearful medium close-up.For students of Dramatic Art, this is a canonical example of tell instead of show - the characters spend so much time telling each other how much they love one another that there's no movie left in which to show us. The whole exercise is so utterly desperate to convince us of the continuance of love beyond death that it just ends up as shallow and insincere.One hell of a movie, for all the wrong reasons.Which is a pity, because The Navigator (another Vincent Ward movie) is among my favourites. See that one instead.",What Dreams May Come

440,Mike-611,A compelling story with a meaningful message,10,8 March 1999,"The story presented in ""What Dreams May Come"" is truly a compelling tale. Taken from Shakespearean musings presented in Hamlet, act III, scene 1; it is not merely a look at what happens after  ""we have shuffled off this mortal coil, ""it is more of a profound look at his first question-""To be or not to be"" and the nature of love.The answer to Hamlet's first question is obvious to the vast majority of the people, but for Annie Nielsen (Annabella Sciorra) it may not be so cut and dried.  Though she has found her soul-mate, the tragic death of her children rocks her to her very foundation.  Her husband, Dr. Chris Nielsen (Robin Williams), through exceptional love, understanding, and will, carries her back from the brink of insanity and suicide.  However, one of life's ""arrows of outrageous fortune"" strikes again taking Chris from her.Chris's new world is made up of the surreal images in the paintings he and Annie both love.  But her paintings and his heaven are each missing something-each other.  As she clings precariously to reality, Chris tries to reassure her from the beyond, and inadvertently, drives her over the edge to suicide.The heart of the film is here, for her suicide means she must spend eternity in hell.  It is not the hell of burning pitch and forked tailed devils, but the more insidious hell of self doubt, guilt, self-loathing, and the absence of love.  Chris's heaven will never be complete without Annie so he embarks on a journey to save her soul, knowing full well that it may cost his own. He leaves on his quest believing that his love for her now, as in life, will bring her back to his world.This movie could have degenerated down to a bunch of swell special effects that would have overpowered the story.  The effects in this film allow the story to cross worlds, giving insight to both Chris's and Annie's thoughts and providing a beautiful view of the their shared, perfect world.  The visions of hell are equally compelling with their grotesque horrors that on the surface provide a visceral terror to the undedicated that disguises the true nature of eternity as being without hope.Robin Williams performance is Oscar caliber.  His range of emotion, from delight to resolution to anguish and despair make the audience feel all of Chris's hopes and fears.  One can easily believe he is Chris.  Annabella Sciorra is equally believable as the ebullient young Annie as well as the despondent, suicidal, on-the-edge Annie.The movie is complex, has depth, and has a message about transcendent nature of true, unconditional love.  While the message is wholesome, the movie is too graphic in parts, and the subject matter too disturbing for younger viewers.  This movie is best seen in a theater, but its message will survive a trip to the small screen.",What Dreams May Come
441,JBond007-3,The biggest sleeper hit of 1998,10,14 August 1999,"In my opinion, I think this movie is the biggest sleeper hit of 98. That's too bad because it has all the great elements of a great movie. I didn't know too much about the movie when I first plugged it in. I heard it had really great visuals and had even won an academy award for best visual effects. I guess I just rented the movie for the pretty pictures.But by the end of the film I was more the amazed. It had to be one of the best movies I've ever seen. It made me laugh it made me wonder and some parts made me feel sympathetic towards the characters which only happens in the really good movies. I was really interested in what happens to the characters in both the present and the past. As the movie plays out you learn more about the characters past which makes you feel like you know the characters personally.However, this movie may not be for everybody. If you like watching movies with bazookas and tanks than maybe you should save $3 and rent something else but who knows maybe this might be the best movie you've ever seen. I give this film a perfect ten",What Dreams May Come

Before I saw it, I was one of the many movie going clones who decided not to see it in the theater because it hadn't been getting the rave reviews that the trailer suggested it should.So, my roommate works at a video store. One night, he brings home ""What Dreams May Come."" For lack of NOTHING better to do, I pop it in one night when I'm home alone. 113 minutes later I was floored. This was a fantastic movie. At first, I was a bit skeptical. Very little character development creation, and death comes just as the introduction to life begins. Then......it all hits. The absolute best computer animation I've ever seen. A plot line that has no obvious holes. A story that has never been addressed on the big screen. A subject that is explored in a way that is both believable and desirable. An incredible movie that leaves you happy, sad, curious, and most of all, drained of energy and exhilarated at the same time. I can't explain the feeling that this movie gave me, and I bet you can't explain the after-life any better than ""What Dreams May Come,"" unless your 3 letter name begins with ""G"" and ends with ""D.""

I can suspend reality with the best of them, and I like sentimental movies -- I even liked Little Women and A River Runs Through It -- but I couldn't abide by this tripe.I think the most annoying thing about this movie is that the premise is interesting and has a lot of unfulfilled promise. It basically tries to state that self-centeredness leads to both mental and spiritual destruction. Along with that is the premise that redemption must be sought; it cannot be imposed from without.The movie really falls apart when Robin Williams' character dies.  Heaven is portrayed as some sort of perfected communist state where God is referenced in the most obtuse of ways.It just gets more dreadful and stultifying from there.If you want to see a movie that makes you think about how our interactions in this life affect our view of the next, rent Babette's Feast.",What Dreams May Come

To my surprise I felt this was one of the best movies I have ever seen. Robin Williams gave a great performance.This movie really has a story! I felt the movie had a lot of the same ideas about the after life that James Von Praage talks about on the talk show circuit and in his books. This move had me exhausted  after it was over and crying with joy.  I thought it was a beautiful story. I am not one to cry at movies being a Firefighter/Paramedic nothing  gets to me! This did!

It says that the best expression of love is to sacrifice oneself for the beloved.I want to make a parallel with the play ""Cyrano de Bergerac"", of Edmond Rostand which is rather different, but also is a song of perfect love. Cyrano prefers to help his adversary in the heart of Roxane, because he thinks that that one is better for her. Doing that, he prefers to sacrifice himself to be sure Roxane is happy.In the film, the husband prefers live forever in the hell, if it is with his beloved wife.

Robin Williams should have gotten an oscar for his performance. I remember Robin when he first broke into acting and he has become one of my favorite actors in recent years. I was surfing through the channels on my satellite when I noticed this movie starring Robin. I never heard of it and couldn't quite recall if I had ever seen it advertised in the theaters. I checked it out and was instantly drawn into the story by Robin's character portrayal. I couldn't walk away from the TV until it was over. When it was over I realized I had cried enough to make my shirt soaked. If anyone that sees this movie has been in love before it will touch your heart. If you see this movie and have never been in love it will open your heart. I was of the latter and I am now in a relationship and very much in love, something I thought had missed out on in life(I'm 38 years old). Now, I thank God for sending me the woman of my dreams and I want to thank Robin and the rest of the cast, as well as the makers of this movie, for showing me through this story that LOVE is not about one's self but about holding another above yourself and sacrificing yourself for that other person no matter what the cost.

The idea that love just may be stronger than death or even damnation is the driving theme of the film. Admittedly, I will only watch this when I am alone, because it makes me cry. I don't cry just because parts of it are sad, but because the sadness is portrayed in such poetic/artistic terms as to become beautiful. And it is the kind of beauty that makes your heart swell and break because it is just too much to take in. The classical and artistic elements used in the film really help to give it a surreal, or I should say a more-than-real quality that helps you believe that you are looking at something not of this world.",What Dreams May Come

What Dreams May Come is a deep reflection about those who want to be always with their love ones. If you don't know what true love means, do not even try to watch it. It's not going to tell you anything at all. To me What Dreams May Come is one of the greatest memorable movies ever made, period.

467,yelick,Love at first sight,10,23 August 2020,"The wonderful drama how to bring your beloved back from hell is ""What dreams may come"", directed by Vincent Ward. It is based on the novel of the same name, written by Richard Matheson in 1978. Though the film was released 20 years after the book wad edited it is still topical and pleasant to watch. It starts Robin Williams and Annabella Sciorra who were selected for their roles very well.
The film is set in the USA and it is about a couple, Chris and Anny, who fell in love with each other very much at first sight. And despite the tragic loss of their children their only dream is to grow old together. Their love is so strong that after the death of one of the spouses, Chris, their love didn't fade away but even caused Anny to commit a suicide in order to be with her beloved again. But the suicide is a mortal sin and her soul goes to hell instead of being with her husband in heaven. And Chris is going to find and bring his wife back to heaven to be together forever. He needs to face all the horrors of hell and overcome his own fears to meet Anny again.

It reminds me of the Mirrormask, aesthetically, but it has a voice of its own. Definitely a film with too little hype in the world. It should be on every top ten list there is. brownie points to everyone, but most of all Robin Williams for his performance. Summed up in one word: Beautiful. Thank you for the amazing experience.

469,Cuco81,Joy of life,10,1 August 2001,"Although the movie mainly takes place after Chris' death, the main theme of the movie, in my opinion, is how wonderful life is. I don't think the movie fails to deliver the message about soul-mates, I just wasn't interested in that. What moved me, was feeling the joy of Chris' joy. I felt happy when he had just realized the reality of paradise and the paint was gone. I felt I knew what it must be like for God to watch the joy and happiness of humans. I felt that, that joy was worth almost anything. That all the misery in life would be worthwhile to achieve that happiness.I don't think the flashbacks disturbed the story at all, as some people have stated. This is how we live our life, how we remember things and it's a form of storytelling I enjoy. Having details about his life revealed slowly is nice, as it gives you the time to imagine what he's feeling. The movie calls for sympathy in the characters, if you don't have that the movie falls apart. I don't entirely agree on the movie's picture of paradise or the after-life, but as I said earlier, it's not about the after-life. It's really about life, and therefore the fictional paradise or hell isn't important.",What Dreams May Come

474,sormani-1,"This is a painting, do not watch the Full Screen Version!",10,3 February 2007,"This movie is like watching a painting. As a fan of Spielberg, Miyazaki and Cameron who believes a large part of the movie experience is the visual amazement, I was enthralled. The storyline was powerful, sad and yet uplifting and was linked tightly with the imagery. Contrast with ""Far and Away"" which had beautiful opening shots of Ireland that had nothing to do with the story. I am not usually someone who is caught up in a love story, but this had a really solid love, a story that unfolded backwards, and one that was linked to being a parent and not just a young couple meeting.I suspect this movie didn't do well because it is a strange mix of modern psychological drama and sheer fantasy. It doesn't fit a niche. Those who do not enjoy both genres may be turned off.I saw the movie because it happened to be on HDTV. The blurb said it was about the afterlife and the title was from Shakespeare and I like a lot of the offbeat movies Robin Williams has starred in, so I checked it out. The opening did not hook me in until I saw the paintings around the house. Do not ruin this movie by watching the Full Screen version!

476,andrewpurcell_nbc,Most outstanding vision of the concept of the afterlife,10,8 March 2007,"I was drawn to this film by the fact that it derives from the novel by Richard Matheson who also wrote Bid Time Return, made into the classic ""Somewhere in Time"" (1980). It follows the journey made by Chris Neilson (Robin Williams) as he passes unexpectedly into the afterlife following on from the death of his own two children. His after life world erupts into a blaze of colour, as he visualises himself within one of his wife, Annie's paintings. It is evident that they are soul mates which makes it difficult for Chris's new life to be fulfilled. It is then that Annie (Annabella Sciorra)commits suicide and in the afterlife is destined to the depths of Hell. On discovering this, Chris then decides to make the unheard of journey to hell to bring her back to his heaven with the risk of remaining in Hell with her. There are a few surprises in store in the way Chris is reunited with his children and how he connects with Annie from the other side. The pace of the film is just as it should be, unrushed, graceful giving the audience time to absorb the elements as it passes through outstandingly colourful scenes.

Buy it, don't rent it because most who do watch it will get their money's worth in the 1st month. Brilliant cinematography in the most surreal and picturesque environments create a stunning visual effect like no other I have ever witnessed. This in combination with outstanding performances by Robin Williams and Cuba Gooding Jr. will have those of all ages riveted to their seat as they glide through this masterpiece. Michael Kamen creates a superb score that eases us through this movie and manipulates every emotion imaginable. I applaud all involved for creating an escape into a world that all of us secretly wonder about, and making it a pleasurable thought rather than the dark and sinister way it is most often portrayed in film. This is by far the most underrated movie of my generation and if even ONE person watches it from this review, the world will be a better place.",What Dreams May Come

If it weren't for the visual effects it would have been an excellent play. It plays on pure, unadulterated humanity. The reality of heartbreak (not the silkened sobbing normally attributed to any scene of emotion in Hollywood)permeates the feel of the movie. While the over-all message is one of steadfast joy, love in it's actual form. I found this movie to be touching, real, well acted, well written, well directed. As with most films of substance, this has seemingly been buried by the sequins and glitz of other movies. I do not consider this a chic flick.

It is a beautiful movie that will touch you in many ways as you watch.The story is very dark at time and then very light at others. Of course the mother dealing with the lose of her children is a very sad thing. I really find the relationship between the parents to be sincere and beautiful I wish there were more movies like this made.The story really takes off with the choice that Chris has to make to go to hell and find his wife. IF that is not love I don't know what is. The idea of facing damnation to find a lost soul is incredible. Cuba Gooding Jr. is very good in his role and expresses his fears with great passion.

491,onheavenswings,The Occupational Hazard of Soul Mates,10,13 July 2009,"Vincent Ward's adaptation of Richard Matheson's novel ""What Dreams May Come"" is a visually and mentally stimulating experience. This story follows the life and death of Chris Nielson and his soul mate Annie. This tale starts with the meeting of Chris and Annie; soul mates placed in each other's lives on a lake in Switzerland. They meet, marry, and have children -- very similar to many romantic movies -- but that is where the similarities end. The biggest difference in this movie is that death does not make for an unhappy ending. It in fact is a new beginning for the two.After a car accident, Chris crosses over to the after life without his soul mate. During this process, Annie is so stricken with grief that she takes her own life. Chris explores the afterlife, but is unwilling to except this new life without his beloved Annie. Hearing of the news that Annie has ended her life and has been sent to hell to live out eternity without Chris is by no means acceptable. He begins a long journey to hell to retrieve his love, a feat that has never been accomplished in all of eternity.This movie explores one man's view on the afterlife, a view so controversial to most that we don't often see it portrayed in movies, let alone the movie's main focus. To sit back and watch the movie I must dwell on the thoughts of what if. What if heaven is a place that I can make on my own? A world I create and control. One where I can explore the areas around me, share with others or just live in solitude, learning of life on earth. If I do have a soul mate on earth, what does that mean in the grand scheme of things? This movie is not one we can just watch: we must evolve our thinking, allowing ourselves to explore the possibility that life after death is something much different then what it is typically taught to us. I found this movie to be a thought altering experience. It takes us down a road mentally that not many of us are willing to go down. It involves progressive thinking even for our time. If you are open and willing to learn about what the afterlife may hold, this is definitely a movie you can not pass up.",What Dreams May Come
492,Dave26000,"Very pretty, and pretty boring.",4,22 February 2012,"While this is a very gorgeous movie, and the general concept is very interesting, the key characters and the actual story leave much to be desired.First of all, we aren't given much time or proper development to understand or even care about much the main character. While Robin Williams is, simply by default, a lovable character in just about any film, the movie simply relies on him running around jumping and smiling and just being Robin Williams. The character itself has very little substance given to him throughout most of the film, he's just some random painter who loves his wife and is happy he made it to heaven.And then there's the entire conflict of the movie, his wife, and this is where the movie utterly failed for me. I guess the writers, both Richard Matheson (novel) and Ronald Bass (screenplay), assume that the audience wholeheartedly accepts Christian Dogma that anyone who commits suicide deserves to rot in hell for eternity, without any other explanation (or any one that makes sense, more on this later), or at least is willing to play along with it enough to actually care about the heaven and hell presented in this movie. The problem is, for what we actually see of his wife, the movie fails to give make us (or at least me) feel that she actually belongs there, or even understand why she's really there at all other than ""you kill yourself and you go to hell"". When we are first introduced to hell (which, in general, is just a very poor-explained, very confusing segment of this movie), we are presented with the idea that it is full of selfish, greedy individuals, most of whom seem to be too concerned with their own worldly selfishness and greed to even realize that they are in hell. When we come across his wife however, she is simply presented to us as a very frustrated, sad woman who can't even remember that she killed herself, further complicating any hope we have of understanding her character. What little we do see of her character, is a strike contrast to the mass group of individuals we first meet when we arrive in hell. We are told at some point that those who commit suicide go to hell because their nature is ""anti-fantasy"" (apparently you can tell everything about somebody's nature by a single action they committed out of desperate loneliness), yet the movie fails to show us that the wife has any such nature.(MAJOR SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT) I guess all of this is supposed to be made better when the main character decides to live forever with her in hell and this actually sends them both to heaven. The problem is, is that this doesn't make any sense. So she gets to go to heaven because he felt he couldn't be happy without her and he acted on it selflessly. BUT WAIT, isn't that same emotion, a selfless ""I can't exist without you"" emotion, the exact same reason his wife killed herself in the first place?!? How is his nature any less ""anti-fantasy"", when their nature and choices are really one in the same, he simply was able to make the choice after his death and therefore did not have to kill himself. And what if someone is not fortunate enough meet such a soul mate on earth, are they not given such an important, eternal second chance? The problem is this movie fails to actually explore any real human morals, emotions, motives, intentions, or ""natures"", and yet attempts to make statements about them solely based on human ACTIONS, rather than, you know, the actual morals, motives, intentions, emotions, and ""natures"". Also, very little actually happens in this movie, yet unfortunately it is not really a short movie. So what we are left with is a pretty movie devoid of any substantial character, action, morals, and therefore any genuine emotion (what this movie tries it's hardest to deliver). But it has a happy ending so.... I guess... that's good?",What Dreams May Come

However, it is very abstract and I was often asking myself ""what's going on?"" throughout the movie (especially in the first 20 minutes). It's definitely got amazing visual effects and it kept me entertained the entire time. It made me think a lot and I had to really focus in order to keep up.

I still think of this movie often because it explained to me why some people go to heaven and others don't.Simply put, we are creations with free will and that goes with us even into death. Suicides don't see heaven because the act of suicide shows complete rejection of god and His ability to see us through any problem. The lesson I learned from this movie is that even in the afterlife we don't see God if we refuse to turn to Him to acknowledge he is there. The afterlife is no longer a mystery to me and I am better equipped to discuss it with others (though if they haven't seen the movie, it's hard to describe this understanding).Beyond that, when I saw the movie I predicted an Oscar for cinematography, which it received. I had never seen colors like these on the screen before. Beautiful.I don't understand why David 26000 is so bummed with the message, but to each his own.

There's one scene where Robin Williams is in a painting and that is breathtaking. The acting is also really good, Robin Williams did an amazing job and really is a very good dramatic actor. However, while the plot line has some surprising twists and turns, the end is fairly predictable and a little bit too sappy. There's nothing wrong with a happy ending, but in some cases it just doesn't seem to fit.Overall, though, this is a fairly good movie. I think it's worth seeing more than once and maybe even buying.

501,sales-294-564699,"Surreal, Haunting, Unsettling, Beautiful",10,17 February 2012,"It was a decade ago that I first saw this film. I was absolutely floored. Never had I seen a movie so hauntingly beautiful. I couldn't believe I had not heard of it before. I picked it up only because it featured Robin Williams.This is a tragic story that brings to the fore uneasy issues that dance around the subconscious: What happens when we die? Is there a heaven and what does it look like? What happens if we lose everything? Do soulmates exist? According to this movie, heaven and hell are not ""places"", but states of consciousness. They appear in a form manifested by your thoughts. For instance, parts of ""hell"" were portrayed as turbulent storms and shipwrecks – e.g. the way one might describe a suicidal person's state of mind.The movie is deeply spiritual which means it won't appeal to everyone, but it's not directed towards any particular religion. Even if you are the least bit spiritual, you will connect to the themes.I was surprised to see some harsh reviews, but I can see why some people might find this movie silly. It's not ""realistic"", it's meant to be surreal. Some of the scenery comes across as cheesy at times, but it is still beautiful. It's art. There are many famous paintings throughout history that depict the afterlife, yet when it's put into a film people aren't so forgiving.Admittedly, upon second viewing 10 years later there are some parts of the movie that could be improved – Annabella Sciora's character, Annie, laughs too much in flashbacks of the ""happy couple"". This is somehow supposed to portray the love and happiness she shared with Robin Williams' character (Chris), but that doesn't quite cut it. There needs to be more dialogue.Furthermore, the kids were annoying and not very endearing, but nevertheless thanks to Williams' acting and the incredible storyline/scenery I could overlook these issues.I would rate this movie one of my favourites, if not favourite of all time, simply for the emotions it brought out of me - emotions that I have not experienced from any other artistic medium.",What Dreams May Come

Dante's Divine Comedy, the 14th century poetic masterpiece, dictates God's perfect justice.  In WDMC, each person creates their own heaven and hell. It provides interesting commentary on a subjective, postmodern age. Suicides are in hell - not by God's edict, but by the person's refusal to understand their own death and let go of their own pain.Cuba Gooding Jr. as a Virgil-of-sorts is effective.  Sometimes he is as philosophically prescriptive as Dante's guide is in the Inferno.

Annie's loss of her soul mate so soon after losing her children, whom she needed so much to help her deal with that loss, was unbearable. I know she was feeling that life was unbearable before she lost Chris and how hard it was for her to hang on but then Chris died and pushed her over the edge that she was already tottering along.

507,surfergrrl-1,Fallacies in theology portrayed in 'What Dreams May Come',1,31 August 2004,"'What Dreams May Come' implies two fallacies regarding theology. (1) The movie falsely portrays the idea that there are unforgivable sins, which God will send us to hell for committing. --- There are no unforgivable sins, according to God, if we accept Jesus as our savior. Romans 8:1 confirms this by stating, 'So now there is no condemnation for those who belong to Christ Jesus.' So there is no punishment of eternal hell for those who accept Jesus. (2) The movie also falsely implies that we can cross over into hell to retrieve a lost soul. This is impossible, according to Luke 16:26, which states, 'And besides, there is a great chasm separating us. Anyone who wanted to cross over to you from here is stopped at its edge, and no one there can cross over to us.' If you would like to be saved and live in heaven after your physical death, all you need to do is say these words, 'Jesus, come into my life. I accept your death on the cross as payment for my sins.'

What is so powerful for me is the way this movie depicts the afterlife, the putting into pictures the concept that your thoughts have energy and are creative -- that we are co creators with the universe not only in our lives here on earth but also in the afterlife of our choosing, by way of our passions. What we are passionate about here on earth becomes a part of us and follows us where we land in our afterlife.The movie's ""discussion"" or presentation of both the concepts of life between lives, and the transition aspect of death; are also explored in the book Journey of Souls by Dr. Michael Newton PhD. I found both the book and the movie extremely helpful in dealing with the aftermath of the death of my mother of ALS and during the death of my father, who died gasping on a vent, to ease his passage into a life hereafter with comforting words and mostly with amazing love for both of them. They both also helped with healing of grief and this movie continues to help me illustrate important concepts beyond mere words.This movie is POWERFUL and moving, not for wimps, and will fascinate anyone who is exploring the concepts of co-creation. Join Robin Williams as Chris Neilson in the surprising journey he takes and his amazing discoveries. I love Robin Williams and the life force he brings to his roles; the innocence he portrays as he explores his surroundings, combined with intelligence and the brilliance of his humor as Chris Neilson, the love he shines forth into the world is just beyond words for me at the moment. ALL the major players in this film bring incredible artistry to it. Watch this movie, oh daring adventurer in Life!

509,Tetris_Lad,Perspective of Heaven and Hell,9,26 September 2004,"Now, everyone in the world, no matter what, thinks something happens after we die. Whether it's an instant of death and we are born again into a new body, and our minds are erased leaving a clean slate to learn again, or we go to some kind of Heaven or Hell. In ""What Dreams May Come"" they bring up a different perspective of what Heaven and Hell look like.Your Heaven is whatever you want it to be, it's a safe haven for you because you just died and are probably scared and insecure about what has happened. Heaven you can create inanimate objects, animals, weather, anything, except Humans. So you couldn't create a loved one and lived with them there happily for eternity. But you can get desperate and imagine people.Hell is a horrible place only because it is of your worst dreams, something that you would not want to live for a moment, let alone a forever. In this movie, when you commit suicide, you automatically are sent to Hell, because suicides are not accepted into Heaven for whatever reason. Maybe it's because if you thought life was too hard for you and you killed yourself, then you were penalized, by being sent to a life much worse then you had it. Or maybe cause suicides aren't aware that they are truly dead.This movie is a good movie to watch with maybe a religious community, and then discuss the different aspects of Heaven and Hell, or just a good movie to watch with yourself, or a GF/BF.

This film has some stunning visuals, particularly for its time of release. These Visuals still hold up pretty well today in 2013. The strong theme of love and a goal for our main character allows us to follow the film through till the end, but at times lacks little more substance and offers the story-line little more than 15 minutes worth of plot.Whilst in a realm that isn't our reality and with rules thrown out the window, it feels at times, we the audience can gain little more footing as to whats going on as the main character, and feels as though the story is being made up as we go along.What Dreams May Come overall is an OK movie and anyone who's a fan of Robin Williams will be pleased with this one. The production design is fantastic, and all the players fill well what is there for them in the characters, but you cant help but feel lost and a little confused, as this was adapted from a book i cant help feel that there was a lot more in the book left out, or in the book the context works better in print.3/10 for me, half an hour too long, not one i would recommend",What Dreams May Come
511,hfujii,makes you think,10,19 February 2005,"One of the things I value most about movies is the way it affects my thoughts. I love this movie because it made me feel various emotions and I could really connect to the emotions displayed (very well displayed) by the characters. Robin Williams was funny and dramatic, perfect for his character. What I most loved about it where the thoughts about life that circled through my head long after I saw this movie. It's a great film to see with a group of serious thinking friends to debate afterward over coffee. I love the proposal of the afterlife the director displays..........I really loved everything about it",What Dreams May Come

I bought the DVD just a few days ago and watched it again tonight and I cried so much. It is an amazing movie that really has you on your seat wondering what will happen next. It is neat to see the possible reality of one's ""after-life"" in heaven or hell. It makes you want to love those whom you love more and more every day and make sure that they know it. I was watching it tonight with my fiancé and could not keep the tears from coming....even after the movie I was crying because I was thinking about how I would feel if I lost him. I am not one to cry much, especially when I'm watching a movie. But this movie was a definite tear-jerker and an excellent must-see film! :o)",What Dreams May Come
513,thegenesis_east,Awesome Production. A Jewel to be Shared.,8,8 March 2005,"The vivid scenes, especially the floral scenes in ""heaven"" are true works of art. I was fortunate enough to view this film in the presence of its Producer, who explained that many hundreds of thousands of individual frames were hand-painted to generate these special effects. No low budget romance here. The producers claim over $50mm was spent in its production.Outstanding performances, literary backdrop (including experiencing a thinly veiled Dante's Inferno)and incredible cinema-photography and artwork makes this a unique and very special movie.A crossover between an art film and a commercial romance.

It would give you a meaning of life and your purpose in it. It has moved me more than i was moved by ""SEVEN POUNDS"". The way i look at at movies as of how much it is thought provoking.I am quiet amused that why this movie is not in top 250 list. It has superb acting as well as magnificent plot, yet it has low ratings. Are people not seeing what this movie can do to them. A human being with his heart beating in his chest would only be moved by this masterpiece.If anyone does not give himself a chance to watch this movie, do yourself a favor and watch it. Honestly speaking it will reconnect you to yourself and to your family. I would say by watching it would be a rebirth of your birth.

This movie is extraordinary. It tops my list of all time movies and I will watch this one over and over. If you have children, watch this, but beware. It is so moving that it will affect you...positively, I hope. The critics of this movie could not possibly have much of a heart or ""open mind"". If you love or have loved, this movie ""hits it"" The visuals...which is what this movie was renowned for was incredible...the style was so innovative.

516,drnickyp-853-841822,Twoddle!,1,14 June 2014,"Please round up all copies of this hateful film and destroy them at once! This is a film of selfish and self-absorbed nobodies wallowing in their own self-pity. It needs to be unmade! It is a clear exercise in stylistic form over any narrative content - it looks beautiful (thanks to the lush colours of Fuji Velvia) and I cannot fault the special effects department who just seemed to be having fun regardless of any brief, but ultimately the visual effects serve as nothing more than a much needed distraction from the trivial flummery of the plot and the underdeveloped, and frankly odious two dimensional characters. Mr Williams should confine himself to the better-fitting boots of his Patch Adams character, and Mr Gooding should go back to acting school. The great Max von Sydow is clearly phoning in his lines, and Werner Herzog is plainly just having a laugh! It does no justice to Richard Matheson' source material and should be regarded as an embarrassment.In the final analysis, this film is about as shallow as a puddle of dog's piddle on concrete, and as hollow as a maggot-eaten gourd, and with about as much appeal!",What Dreams May Come
517,kyreamin,Generic Robin Williams for Pseudo Intellectual Housewives,1,16 January 2014,"I was first drawn to What Dreams May Come by its awarded reputation for stunning visual effects and its stylistic references to Impressionism and Heironymus Bosch's masterpiece painting The Garden Of Earthly Delights. The 16th century Spanish painting, a triptych composed of scenes of heaven, earth and hell, provide a structure for the plot that is loosely based on the ancient Greek myth of Orpheus venturing into Hades to return his wife from the afterlife.These classical references had me anticipating a thought provoking allegorical exploration of the consequences of human mortality. But what was delivered was tediously pretentious crap dressed up as sophisticated discourse. Make no mistake, although this film is dark at times and not for children, it is whispy vacuous crap. This is cotton candy spirituality made for dunderhead housewives who ""want to believe"" and their rat race husband-drones they've dragged into this shallow affirmation of nuclear family love.The biggest philosophical plot hole here is in the idea that you're more than the sum of your body parts, therefore this godless afterlife must be real. Sorry there, new age consumers, but consider how physical brain damage affects mental abilities, and you'll realise you have no consciousness outside of your brain/body. Spiritualism is bunk.Not to dwell on the metaphysical failures of this film, there's also the fact that the protagonist is literally Robin Williams. That is, Robin Williams in yet another Robin Williams role as Dr. Nice Guy with his quirky one liners, over orchestrated moments of sad face and feel good resolutions. I can only speculate as to how much the film was dumbed down to appeal to the star's typical target audience, but there was definitely potential lost here. Also, what was with the trans-racial spiritual reincarnation of his white children as a Black guy and an Asian woman? Was it really just to make heaven more ethnically diverse for wider audience appeal? Who knows.That said, if you're into fuzzy feel good adult dramas, and are curious for a taste of something that seems arty and deep, but nothing that will mentally challenge you, then dive right in to What Dreams May Come and swallow up the oily slop within.",What Dreams May Come

It shows the journey of one couple through life and beyond. It is spiritual but not religious. The effects were astounding but the acting was TERRIFIC. Robin Williams excursion to this kind of film was totally on target. I do not think anyone could have done better. Cuba Gooding Jr. did wonderfully as well. This movie is a journey for your heart and your mind. There are a very few movies that I feel so strongly about. I am a book lover.

It affected me emotionally very much, of course. Since I survived my 'death' and it is now 2014, I still remember it with warm feelings, especially as Robin Williams just died. Life is but a moment. I do not recall what the Academy Award was for but Color/Photography or SPecial Effects would have been my vote. the concept that one can redeem or be saved from hell by another or if for the right reason(love), is a true meaning of Love.

My husband kept watching, and I watched with 1 eye while playing around on the internet. I could barely make it to the end. I don't know why some people like or love this movie. I tried, but it just seemed to be trying too hard, and miserably failing at attempting to give us the meaning of life. Blah blah blah blah blah just words trying to be spiritual. But it's tedious and painful to watch. Overly dramatic, trying to pull heartstrings and failing. Tragedy all around. Not uplifting or ethereal like death and the afterlife and heaven truly are. Depressing. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I feel I know the beauty of heaven from reading books about near death experiences, especially Dr. Ebun Alexander. Now there is truth about the beauty of dying. This movie was just a mess.",What Dreams May Come
522,jengre13,What Dreams May Come Review,10,2 December 2014,"The original story of this movie came from a novel published in 1978 by Richard Matheson named What Dreams May Come. This is a fantasy drama film starring Robin Williams, Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Annabella Sciorra. Robin Williams plays a doctor who is a loving father and husband named Chris Nielson. Cuba Gooding, Jr. plays a spirit that Chris knew in life as Albert Lewis a doctor, friend, and mentor from his medical residency. Annabella Sciorra plays Chris's wife Annie Nielson an artist who is a loving mother and wife. This movie makes me want to believe in the afterlife. Here are some details to make you watch the movie.At the beginning of this movie everything seems to be normal in the world of the Nielson family. As the movie continues tragedy strikes the family suddenly. The movie shows incite on how families change after losing one of their members. When you lose someone that you are close to it makes you feel like giving up. You can be depressed and full of hopelessness. In the movie a family member gets checked into a help clinic so they do not hurt themselves through troubling times.After the tragedy in the family the movie takes a twist into the afterlife. In the afterlife part of the movie it is just like some of the other ways we have all heard it described. People end up being healthy and live forever in eternity. Some of the scenes in the afterlife part of the movie seem really cool. If you think of something you want to see or have happen all you have to do is choose for it to happen. The Afterlife part of this movie is by far the best part. It will make you wonder what you would do if you were there. There is heaven and hell in this movie just like in different religions there are ways to go either direction. Resurrection is mentioned in the afterlife for those who are in the heaven side.The acting in this movie was exactly what the director wanted perfection. The emotions shown by the actors and actresses were very realistic. The visual effects in this movie were one of the best out of any drama movie I have ever seen. In the afterlife the scenery in the background is a must see. It won an academy award for best visual effects in 1998. Usually in a movie that has tragedy there is someone in the movie whose performance is not acceptable compared to the others. This movie is not like that you have to see it to know how good they did.What Dreams May Come is kind of a chick flick but at least this one has some good visuals to keep us men entertained. Robin Williams is the best actor in this movie it is a shame that he will not be making anymore. People will miss his vibrant energy that he shows in a list of movies that he has been in. If you have not seen this movie you should rent it first like people always say. Once you have seen it though you will end up buying it. This movie is kind of emotional and it will probably make you tear up. The ending of this movie is one of the best parts but the whole movie is great.",What Dreams May Come
523,canucksfan-220-432174,Read the book instead,1,23 January 2015,"I can't understand how author Richard Matheson could have had any input into this ridiculous movie. It's like an abbreviation of the actual story with all of the important bits left out or changed completely to make them ""happier"". There is almost nothing that stays true to the book, except perhaps the names. The actual story is beautiful and thought provoking, and this movie tries to be the same, but fails miserably. There is zero character development, and the whole thing feels rushed. This could have been an amazing movie if it had only been true to the novel. As is, it should have just had a different title so I wouldn't have wasted time watching it. Terrible....Just read the book.",What Dreams May Come

It was so sad. i t really put into perspective everything about life and death. The doctor was so upset that hi wife gave up and he loved her so much the he went through heaven and hell just to try to help her. That is what love really is. It was so beautiful and sad, but all in all, it makes us really think about life and death and all those who love us and about everyone we love. They should make more movies like t this.

526,gyges_77,Myth of Orpheus,10,29 April 2007,"The movie is a modern interpretation of the Greek myth of Orpheus, who descended to Hades, to save his wife Euridice. While fleeing from Aristaeus (son of Apollo), she strode on a serpent and was bitten, which brought her to her death. Distraught, Orpheus played such sad songs and sang so mournfully that all the nymphs and gods wept and gave him advice. Orpheus went down to the lower world and by his music softened the hearts of Hades and Persephone (the only person to ever do so), who agreed to allow Eurydice to return with him to earth. But the condition was attached that he should walk in front of her and not look back until he had reached the upper world. In his anxiety he broke his promise, and Eurydice vanished again from his sight. The story in this form belongs to the time of Virgil, who first introduces the name of Aristaeus. Other ancient writers, however, speak of Orpheus' visit to the underworld; according to Plato, the infernal gods only ""presented an apparition"" of Eurydice to him.",What Dreams May Come

Those who claim it as slow and lacking a story line are very much incorrect.You may not like the idea that suicide leads to hell, but that is what the book this movie was adapted from holds and the ending to the book is even less forgiving that the movie.It is a deeply touching love story and a great example of sacrifice.

529,gilfajoy,A movie about the two students of love who was bounded by their emotion through the hurdle of misery and despair.,9,19 August 2005,"The film, ""What Dreams May Come"" is a wonderful movie. Those it had revealed misery and death, it was all bounded together by the character's love for each other. The story has been portraying equilibrium between to loss of despair and the hope of love. And the way the portrayed Heaven as a painting aroused my interest even further. ""What dreams May Come"" gave me a new perception about Heaven and Hell.Heaven, as the film had revealed, is place that an individual conjures up in his imagination, and when brought into actuality, the details become more vivid and even more better that what the hypothalamus could come up with. Yet, the element used in the imagining was still there; paint.Purgatory turned out to be a lake where people stay until their fate is truly decided, whether they'll end up in heaven or Hell.Hell was very much different that I expected hell to be.

I congratulate them on their genius.Those who have experience deeply meaningful experiences beyond the world of physical senses see these images and concepts as actual possibilities, and rightly so.

However, I feel that it is a very good movie. Robin Williams gets away from his comedic (spelling?) ways and plays a more serious tone in this movie. However, you can see some of his comedic ways because they let them slip in, however, it is unnoticeable since the fact that they cover it up so fast. The wife, who kills herself plays a perfect part that 1) Support Williams serious tone 2) Plays a depressed role convincing the audience that she really is a freaking. 3) She is soft when she is convincing others.

Wonderful love story too. Like they say, Hell only exist to those who refuse to ask forgiveness.. Well done Sir Williams, on of you 5 best dramatic performance. You made your character more human and real that any other actor could have done it, perfect. Thanks. This movie teaches us not to give up on the one we love.

Plus time is not important, only life is, during or after. Interseting way of picturing heaven, or for those who don't believe in it, the after life.
