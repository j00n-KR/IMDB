0,TheLittleSongbird,"Intelligent, heart-warming, poignant, uplifting and gratifying...",9,30 May 2010,"I am running out of words to describe how good Fried Green Tomatoes was. It may be two or three minutes too long, but other than that, there is very little wrong with this film. The film is amazing to look at, with gorgeous scenery and cinematography, and the score was beautiful. Fried Green Tomatoes also has an intelligent and heart-warming story, strong direction and some charming, funny and touching dialogue as well. The ending was suitably uplifting, but I admit I did shed a tear, mostly because I was so impressed by how beautiful the film was.Also superb is the acting. Jessica Tandy is absolutely brilliant in this film, and quite rightly received an Oscar nomination. She plays an old-timer in the American South, who tells stories of the bigotry she encountered during her youth in the 1930s. Kathy Bates is a sheer delight as Evelyn, a modern-day housewife who visits Tandy in the nursing home and finds inspiration in memories from her past. Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary-Louise Parker are terrific as well as Ingrid and Ruth.Overall, Fried Green Tomatoes is a lovely little film, wonderfully acted and just very relaxing to watch. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Fried Green Tomatoes
1,SnoopyStyle,Story of friendship,7,7 September 2013,"Timid housewife Evelyn Couch (Kathy Bates) befriends old Ninny Threadgoode (Jessica Tandy) at a retirement home. She recounts an old depression era story of Idgie Threadgoode (Mary Stuart Masterson) and her friendship with Ruth Jamison (Mary-Louise Parker). Their lives are forever linked by the death of Idgie's brother who was Ruth's boyfriend.This is based on a novel that takes place in Alabama. The modern story doesn't have quite the punch. The old time story exceeds it in almost every way. It may have been an important part of the novel, but I don't know if the modern story necessarily adds anything to the movie. Both Marys are outstanding in their roles. Their characters are truly the center of this movie.",Fried Green Tomatoes
2,Hitchcoc,A Superb Story Comes to Life,10,5 January 2017,"So many have praised this film. The naysayers don't seem to like women, or feel threatened by the portrayal of the men in this story. Let's face it. Racism and women bashing has been such a part of this world, let's not get carried away by a film that puts women in a positive light as they face off against this threat. This is a story of survival. Survival from an ugly force, founded on physical violence and drunkenness. When the women begin to look out for each other's needs, it's when they become energized. From Kathy Bates, who hears the story, to the final outcome, this gets more and more interesting. Fanny Flagg's book comes to life as Idgie becomes one of literature's and cinema's most wonderful characters. I will never forget the barbecue scene. Of course, reviewers seldom mention the scene in the parking lot. That's worth the price of admission.",Fried Green Tomatoes
3,classicsoncall,"""Life has a funny way of workin' things out.""",8,17 May 2018,"Anyone else think that Idgie and Ninny were the same person? I didn't catch any other reviews who broached the topic, but the FAQ page for this movie addresses the topic from opposite perspectives. I'll tell you what I think at the end.This movie is over a quarter century old and I just got around to it. That happens sometimes and after seeing one like that, I have to wonder why it took so long. I enjoyed this one for it's story telling style and gentle humor. Going in, if the only thing you've seen is the DVD sleeve, you would think the story is about four women of varying ages who become friends during a particular time and place. Instead, it spans the generations with the principal characters and story taking place in the 1920's, while the flashbacks to that era occur roughly during the time the picture was made. It's not an unusual filming technique but here it worked especially well.This is an unusual love story but not in the traditional sense. Ruth Jamison (Mary-Louise Parker) and Idgie Threadgoode (Mary Stuart Masterson) become fast friends after a bit of a rough start, and their relationship grows stronger over the period of time that transitions from teenage years to young adulthood. The bond is cemented when Idgie and her friend George (Stan Shaw) save Ruth from a disastrous marriage. The plot thickens at this point, and it takes an additional five years to come to terms with the disappearance of Ruth's husband shortly after the incident at Frank Bennett's (Nick Searcy) farm. The only disconnect I have with the story is the way Idgie and George were arrested for the murder of Frank Bennett. There was absolutely no grounds for the arrest to my thinking. Idgie did make a statement that she would 'kill Frank' if he ever came by to harm Ruth again, but that was stated in the heat of the moment. Sheriff Curtis Smoote (Raynor Scheine) using that as a pretext for arresting Idgie didn't make any sense to me at all. Not only that, but the truck recovered from the swamp had no body in it. That should have been enough to preclude any kind of murder trial. Be that as it may, I got a kick out of the judge dismissing the case because as he rightly proclaimed, it wasn't a case at all. The Reverend Scroggins (Richard Riehle) swearing on a copy of 'Moby Dick' was a neat bonus.But there was another facet of the cross examination that bothered me as well. When Ruth was pressed by the prosecuting attorney as to the reason why she left her husband, she replied that it was because Idgie was the person she loved the most in the whole world. Why couldn't she have said that it was because her husband beat her? Leaving that out of the script seemed like an unforced error that would have exonerated Ruth favorably. The story didn't need it as it turned out, but still, that bothered me. Taken all together though, this was a fine story of friendship and loyalty with enough of those little home spun tales thrown in to make it endearing. Like Buddy's (Chris O'Donnell) 'oyster/pearl' analogy and the one about the geese moving the lake out of state. I'm going to remember those for the grand-kids. I think they'll get a kick out of 'em.Oh, and by the way, even though the book that this film was based on had Idgie and Ninny (Jessica Tandy) as separate people, I think there was enough ambiguity at the finish to make them one and the same in this movie. I think Evelyn (Kathy Bates) would agree.",Fried Green Tomatoes

I always assumed it was a ""chick flick"". Maybe in some ways it is, with the unhappy house wife and the lesbian relationship (which is toned way down for the film). But the stories have a wide appeal, especially when it involves a murder mystery. Not to mention the look at race, which is not your typical ""romantic comedy"" fare.This is definitely worth watching for just about anyone.

5,lee_eisenberg,"Going' south for a masterpiece...and to think that I once confused the title with ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes""!",10,25 July 2006,"In one of the many movies celebrating everything that we love about life, disaffected Alabama housewife Evelyn Couch (Kathy Bates) gets acquainted with elderly Ninny Threadgoode (Jessica Tandy) and learns the old woman's experiences to the point of liberation. It's great to see Idgie Threadgoode (Mary Stuart Masterson) not taking crap from anyone, coming out against racism, and even going so far as to wear pants (in old Alabama!). As for the possible implication that she and Ruth Jamison (Mary-Louise Parker) were lesbians, that gives the movie more of a liberating feeling.I don't know whether or not I would call it a chick flick. True, it focuses on women, but there's some stuff in store for the guys too.Anyway, this is definitely one of those movies that you gotta see before you croak. You're sure to love Evelyn's rant after she feels fully liberated (although as a man, I guess that I'd want to be careful around her!). A real masterpiece. Also starring Cicely Tyson, Chris O'Donnell and Stan Shaw.",Fried Green Tomatoes
6,jboothmillard,Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe,6,11 May 2009,"Someone told me that this is worth trying, and the cast list looked appealing, so I decided to take their advice. Basically Evelyn Couch (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Kathy Bates) is having difficulties with her marriage to husband Ed (Gailard Sartain), and no-one seems to be taking her seriously. Then one day while in a nursing home visiting relatives, she meets Ninny Threadgoode (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Jessica Tandy), an out going old woman, who over their time together tells her story of Idgie Threadgoode (Mary Stuart Masterson), and obviously through flashbacks we see this story for ourselves. These flashbacks take us to 1920's Alabama, where Idgie forms a friendship with Ruth Jamison (The Client's Mary-Louise Parker), after the tragic death of Idgie's brother Buddy (a brief Chris O'Donnell), and working in the Whistle Stop Cafe, cooking the signature dish, fried green tomatoes, and living through The Great Depression. These stories of Ninny's give Evelyn great influence to confront her negligent husband. That's the basic story I got, and they become true friends. Also starring Stan Shaw as Big George, Cicely Tyson as Sipsey, Gary Basaraba as Grady Kilgore and Richard Riehle as Reverend Scroggins. Tandy is likable as the nice old woman, Bates is almost as good as the annoyed wife in need of attention, and there are one or two good moments in the flashbacks, but I don't think it was fantastic, but certainly worth a go. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Good!",Fried Green Tomatoes
7,moonspinner55,Southern-fried tripe,4,20 October 2002,"An unhappy Alabama housewife is enlightened by her friendship with a story-tellin' oldster in a nursing home and her tales of two disparate gals in the days before World War II. Screenwriter Fannie Flagg, adapting her play, has a very narrow conception of character based solely on exteriors. Her idea of a tough, rebellious young woman is one who smokes, plays poker in a gin mill with rowdies and wears men's clothes (she swears, too, and is unafraid of bees). The point of Flagg's script seems to be that being 'nice' and 'good' doesn't get you anywhere (wasn't that the message behind ""Grease"" as well?). ""Tomatoes"" is Southern-stereotypical and trite without an ounce of substance or spontaneity, but audiences responded anyway to the parallel friendships, the feisty ladies of different generations, the homilies and homespun grit. Still, it's rather like a Hallmark special, all dolled-up to please, with caricatures substituting for characters. ** from ****",Fried Green Tomatoes
8,edwagreen,Fried Green Tomatoes in Forever Tasty ****,10,21 August 2008,"Wonderful motion picture with a stellar cast.Kathy Bates, as Mrs. Couch, along with her husband, go to a nursing home repeatedly to visit his cantankerous aunt. While they get thrown out of her room repeatedly, Bates soon strikes up a friendship with one of the residents who tells her an unbelievable story of love, tragedy, redemption in the south following World War 1.The older woman is marvelously played by the late Jessica Tandy, who received a best supporting Oscar nomination for her performance.There are wonderful performances by Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary Louise Parker who form a life's friendship following the tragic death of one's brother while trying to retrieve a hat lost by the other woman along railroad tracks.This is a story of a brutal marriage subjected to one of the girls. It is well told along the backdrop of the 1930s and the Ku Klux Klan operating in both Alabama and Georgia.The picture works well because it treats a murder of the abusive husband in a comical way and there is a triumph of the human spirit along the way.This film was vastly under-rated.",Fried Green Tomatoes

10,writers_reign,"Honey, I Charmed The Bees",9,2 August 2006,"This is something of a rarity, a film set in the Deep South in the twenties/thirties that ISN'T Southern Gothic (okay, neither was To Kill A Mockingbird, but think of ANYTHING by Carson McCullers). Jessica Tandy, who was actually English and had a successful career on the London stage and a less successful one as Mrs Jack Hawkins, is back in the South she visited first when she created the role of Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire on Broadway in 1947, albeit this time around Alabama as opposed to Louisiana and is a joy as the frame narrator enchanting Kathy Bates with her reminiscences of life in the 20s and 30s; a life that embraced laughter, tears and a murder trial. It's all there, the small, sleepy town, the benign Blacks, the obligatory KKK, the eponymous cafe which is the focal point of the town but at the heart of it all a wonderful and enduring friendship to rival that in Il Postino. Virtual unknowns Mary-Louise Parker and Mary Stuart Masterson hold their own and more against the veteran Tandy and well-established Bates but all the cast turn in exceptional work. Unashamedly Art House the number of positive comments on this very site are testimony that it found its audience. This will enhance any DVD collection.",Fried Green Tomatoes

12,evanston_dad,Girl Power in the Deep South,8,19 November 2008,"A heartwarming female bonding movie that has all the elements of a good ol' Southern yarn.It was a good thing that Kathy Bates made this movie so soon after ""Misery."" She had made such an impression as a psycho in the earlier film that she might have had trouble getting herself out from under the mantle of Annie Wilkes. But she plays a completely different character here, a dowdy, bored housewife who befriends a little old lady forgotten in a retirement home (Jessica Tandy). Tandy begins to tell her the story of a female relative, Idgie Threadgoode, and her deep friendship with Ruth, which is played out in flashback by Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary-Louise Parker. The story is one of those melodramatic, life-affirming ones, but it's acted extremely well by the four women, and the film mostly avoids the treacle that threatens to come pouring in around the edges.Grade: A-",Fried Green Tomatoes
13,HotToastyRag,Love-it-or-hate-it,1,18 December 2018,"There are two types of people in this world: those who love Fried Green Tomatoes and those who hate it. There really is no middle ground when this movie is concerned. In fact, you can probably use this as a qualification while picking potential friends!Kathy Bates is in a stale marriage and feels lost and alone. She meets Jessica Tandy, who tells her a story-shown to film audiences through flashbacks with Mary Stuart Masterson, Mary-Louise Parker, and Chris O'Donnell-about a ""fictional"" young woman who grew up during the Great Depression in the South. It's supposed to be a huge surprise that Jessica's story is actually her own, but it's so painfully obvious from the moment she opens her mouth that anyone who doesn't figure it out probably won't figure out that I've just spoiled the surprise. Through listening to Jessica-and continually being too stupid to figure out it's a true story-Kathy gets inspired to learn to love herself and live a more fulfilling life. There are some who will find her journey touching and exciting, and there are some who will think it's trite, predictable, and unrealistic.If you like female bonding, commiserating over ""typical"" bad husbands, and the idea that an interaction with a stranger can inspire you to change your life, you'll probably sign up for Team-Tomatoes. If you don't chuckle over watered-down, soccer-Mom jokes and think female exploratory classes where the members are required to get to know themselves by looking at their private parts in mirrors are absurd, you probably won't sign up for Team-Tomatoes. Go ahead and form your own anti-team, and let me know what you name it so I can join up.",Fried Green Tomatoes
14,gradyharp,An Old Friend of a Movie,10,3 November 2006,"There are films that linger in memory for the warmth they exude and the impression they leave. So it is with the now 15 year old film FRIED GREEN TOMATOES based on the novel 'Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe' by Fannie Flagg and arranged for the screen by that author. This is a film that explores racism, feminism, respect for the elderly, women's rights, and so very much more in a manner that is infectious to watch repeatedly and defies forgetting.Told on two levels, the film is narrated by the elderly Ninny Threadgoode (a luminous Jessica Tandy) who idles away her hours in her nursing home with stories about her childhood she shares with the sad, obese, emotionally fragile Evelyn (Kathy Bates) whose life of misery is slowly corrected by Ninny's tales of how two women in the past overcame impossible odds. The story she tells dates back to Alabama in the 1930s when a young upstart Idgie Threadgoode (Mary Stuart Masterson) is calmed by a frightened but solid Ruth Jamison (Mary-Louise Parker) and how their partnering results in a series of events that involve murder, racism, and some very strange events.The cast is superb, the script is delicious (!), and Jon Avnet directs with aplomb not only the fresh talent mentioned above, but also such fine actors as Cicely Tyson, Chris O'Donnell, Stan Shaw, Lois Smith and a large cast of supporting actors. The re-creation of the Old South is palpably well focused as is the hilarious and touching stance from the contemporary standpoint of the nursing home and house of the chameleon Evelyn. It is a choice bit of film-making and one that deserves a place in every film lover's library. Grady Harp",Fried Green Tomatoes
15,sddavis63,Interesting But Not Overpowering,5,5 February 2012,"Watching the progression of the relationship between Idgie (Mary Stuart Masterson) and Ruth (Mary-Louise Parker) is fairly interesting. The story is a flashback; a story related by Ninny Threadgoode (Jessica Tandy) to Evelyn (Kathy Bates) who befriends Ninny in a local nursing home. So right off the top you can see that there's a pretty decent cast. Also almost from the start you realize that Ninny is a bit of an enigmatic character. Is she or is she not Idgie relating her own story? The movie seems to lead in that direction but never actually makes it explicit, so in the end it's left to the viewer to decide. Basically, this ends up as a murder mystery from the past. Ruth's abusive husband is murdered, and the question is who killed him. Idgie is put on trial for the crime, but the charges are dismissed. The mystery is held pretty well until the end of the movie.The movie begins with Idgie as a child, and with Ruth as her older brother Buddy's love interest. After Buddy's tragic death, Idgie and Ruth develop a very close friendship - the movie bobs and weaves around the issue of what the nature of their relationship was. Was it just a close friendship? Was it more? My feeling from the movie is that Idgie wanted more than a friendship; Ruth's interests were less clear. I haven't read the book, but I understand that the novel is quite clear in making the point that there was a lesbian romance between the two. Perhaps Hollywood in 1991 was still too nervous about such an issue to make it front and centre; ambiguity was as much as the studios could stomach apparently. We follow both of them through the ups and downs of life as they open a cafe together, whose menu specialty is - you guessed it - fried green tomatoes.Kathy Bates provided some comedy to the movie as the modern day housewife who goes through a rebirth after meeting Ninny - a rebirth that totally confuses her husband Ed (Gailard Sartain), who doesn't have a clue why Evelyn is changing so much and upsetting their comfortable existence. While she provided comedy, I wasn't really taken in by Bates' character in this. I thought the constant switching between present and past was overdone and not particularly well done to be honest; in a lot of ways the two parts of the stories didn't mesh that well. Aside from Bates, there were a lot of very likable characters from the past, such as Big George (Stan Shaw) and Smokey Lonesome (Timothy Scott.) The identity of Ruth's husband's killer in the end took me by surprise, so that was well done.My final reaction to this was that it was a basically well made and well acted movie, and at times even an interesting movie as the story unfolded - but that it also seemed like a movie that was anything but overpowering. It didn't leave me awestruck. (5/10)",Fried Green Tomatoes
16,ElMaruecan82,A story about women's liberation that even men will find liberating...,8,10 October 2016,"""Fried Green Tomates"" won the ""Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation"" award for best film featuring a lesbian relationship although none of it is explicitly showed! This is very revealing about Hollywood's timid representation of same-sex relationships in 1991 and how ""Fried Green Tomatoes"", for all its 'innocent' charm, was quite ahead of its time and featured possibly one of the best love stories of the 90's, between two Southern women in the midst of the Great Depression: Idgie (Mary Stuart Masterson) and Ruth (Mary Louise Parker). Oh, they were friends, there's no doubt about it, but I fail NOT to see hints of a platonic love. Friends are people whose deep attachment isn't altered by a separation, but in love, one can simply not accept separation, and that Idgie and Ruth stayed together until one's final breath and the emotional reaction of the survivor says enough. Today, we'd have needed torrid sex scenes to get the point and it's probable that ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" would've been fried alive for not going as far as Fannie Flagg's novel went. But to be honest, I also regret that the movie didn't allow not even a simple kiss, a bold move even Spielberg dared in ""The Color Purple"". There's a sort of tacit hypocrisy that would have spoiled the enjoyment had the performances not been as appealing.So, we assume it's ""friendship"", and the episode that prepares it for the coming years is the saddening death of Idgie's big brother Buddy, and this is one of these tragedies, unnoticeably built up, you see nothing coming until it hits you in the face... literally, and make you realize how cruel life can get. Chris O' Donnell's performance is brief but memorable because we've rarely seen such a sweet guy. He's a young and gentle soul capable to find the right words, the right story so his tomboy sister Idgie stops paying attention to what other people think. That his brother dates the sweet Ruth was possibly the best life scenario for Idgie, brutally canceled by a train, and a shoe stupidly blocked in a rail track.""Fried Green Tomatoes"" is all told in flashback and it's purely accidental how the storyteller named Ninnie (Jessica Tandy) meets the shy and sweet Southern wife Evelyn, Kathy Bates in a role totally opposite to her previous Annie Wilkes. There was no reason for Ninnie to approach Evelyn in that retiring home, or for Evelyn to listen, but Ninnie simply felt like telling the story of some murder that happened in her youth. But even that juicy anecdote needed a good set-up so the story had to start with Buddy's death, and rightfully so, because this is how the film gets our attention and Evelyn's. The first death is basically the starter of the relationship between Ninnie and Evelyn's, Idgie and Ruth, and the viewers with the film. It all works on three levels.Back to the story: both women lost someone very dear at the same time, there's a profound wound that could hardly be concealed until they understood they were each other's remedies to their existential emptiness. Idgie is a masculine, free-spirited, loudmouth girl who's like the female version of Huck Finn. Ruth Jameson is a modern version of Scarlett's cousin Melanie, with an additional thirst for fun and adventures. Friendships are built on complementarity and that's exactly what the relationship between the two women is about, they drive each other,and find together the strength to fight adversity. In our times where it's all about empowered women, here's a movie that can easily labeled as a chick flick, but as a guy, I could relate to it, because it reflects achievements made by women being true to their nature.And I love how the story also affects Evelyn. She belongs to an era where women are supposedly stronger and more independent but this is a sweet wife who just wants her TV-sport-addict husband, fittingly named Couch, and played by a priceless teddy-bear like Gailard Sartain, to care about her. By today's standards, she would be pushed to leave her husband or pee on his beer but Evelyn loves him, she's an insecure woman, going through the 'change' and addicted to chocolate bars, the trick is that she has to learn to love herself. Today's feminism teaches to hate men, here's a film infinitely more feminist, that is about loving people and loving yourself, without any gender shift.Take the most memorable scene where Evelyn's parking spot is taken by two young girls, and then, referring to Idgie's nickname, she pulls a 'Towanda"" and hits their car several times before delivering the famous ""Face it girls, I'm older and I have more insurance"". It's not about a woman under the man's power but a woman victim of bullying. And for the same reason, Idgie couldn't stand Ruth's abusive husband and saved her friend by doing a little more. And when they opened the Whistle Stop and needed to protect their business, their interest, their lives, there were guys to help them, white men, black men, old men, and by exercising their male power; physical, legal or religious, and women helped them too, with their inner strength  and what could come at hand, like a frying pan and even, what women supposedly did best: cooking.The flashback structure of the film is essential as it shows two women of different eras and yet the 'modern' woman still find a lot to learn from her elder. ""Fried Green Tomatoes"", while no masterpiece, defies all preconceived notions by showing that there was no specific period for women's liberation, they conquered their independence by being women, not by imitating men. The two parts of the film were not movie material but together they formed a touching and inspirational hymn to independence, love and self-esteem, and again, even as a guy, I found it irresistibly liberating!",Fried Green Tomatoes

It also combined very well the future with the present and how both are connected even though are different. The direction which was made by Jon Avnet was exceptional and he did an excellent job on how he presented his main characters and he connected them. The interpretations of both Kathy Bates who played as Evelyn Couch and Jessica Tandy who played as Ninny Threadgoode were outstanding. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Mary Stuart Masterson's who played as Idgie Threadgoode, Cicely Tyson's who played as Sipsey and Mary-Louise Parker's who played as Ruth Jamison.

19,robert-temple-1,An authentic classic,10,22 October 2012,"I have just seen this wonderful film for the third time, after many years, and it is such a classic, and has not lost any of its interest or appeal. Indeed, it is more relevant now than it ever was, considering that it is about the plight of women and how they cope with their various life situations. It is based on a novel, and has a screenplay by, Fannie Flagg. It is set in Alabama where she comes from, and the story presumably has some basis in truth. Not many people know that Fannie Flagg used to be a brilliant comedienne. I knew her in the mid 1960s when she was a stand-up comic, and she was hilarious. She used to perform at a marvellous comedy cabaret night club in Manhattan, now long gone, which had two floors. The upstairs was called Upstairs at the Downstairs, and the downstairs was called Downstairs at the Upstairs. It was at 37 West 56th Street and was run by an amusing and eccentric woman whose name I have forgotten, alas. Fannie played there at the same time as Madeline ('Maddy') Kahn, who was also wildly funny. Fannie told me she had wanted to perform under her own real name of Patricia Neal, but was told by her agent or manager, I believe, that she could not do that because there was a famous film actress of that name already, so she invented the name Fannie Flagg for herself. It was only years later that she wrote this marvellous heart-felt novel, which was rejected by many publishers, but which finally came out and then resulted in this film. And it is this which really made Fannie Flag famous. The film was shot in Georgia, which is next door to Alabama. But the story is mostly set in Alabama in a little town called Whistle Stop. That name arose because it was a settlement situated beside the railroad. Many small Southern towns fell into desuetude (i.e. withered away) when the railroads started collapsing, after the construction of the interstate highway system, which shifted so much travel and freight transport onto roads and destroyed the rail industry, from the 1950s onwards. In this film which takes place at two different times, during the pre-War period which constitutes the earlier story, the two young women, Idgie and Ruth, open a railside café called The Whistle Stop Café. In those years, it thrived and became the heart of the town, where everyone went to eat real home cooking, which included the favourite local delicacy, fried green tomatoes, which were sliced and fried in batter in what in the South is called a skillet, which is an old 17th century English word for a frying pan, the word surviving only in the American South and nowhere else. (I still fry my eggs and bacon in an old iron family skillet which was cast in the family forge at Taunton, Massachusetts, in the 17th or 18th century. We have been using that skillet for many generations. Just imagine how many bacon fat molecules survive in the crystalline interstices of the cast iron after those centuries of use every morning. The outside of the skillet looks like something dug up by an archaeologist, but the inside is shiny and ready for anything. But this question arises: can bacon fat go rancid after a century or two? It does seem to improve the flavour anyway. However, I am ashamed to say that I have never fried any green tomatoes, which is doubtless a great personal failing of mine. The skillet has thus been deprived of what Ruth and Idgie would perhaps consider to be its main function, to deal with those green tomatoes.) Idgie, who is a hopeless cook, cannot prepare them, so Ruth has to do it. Throughout the film people keep tasting them to see if they are up to standard. The modern story of the film consists of tales told by an old lady in a retirement home to a much younger woman, and the effect this has on transforming her life. That younger woman is played by Kathy Bates, whose performance is breathtaking in its sensitivity and brilliance. But then, Kathy Bates has always been one of everybody's favourite and most endearing actresses, and we all know what a genius she is. The old woman is played equally brilliantly by the famous Jessica Tandy, veteran of a lifetime of superlative achievements in both stage and screen. Before TV wiped all the brains of the public as clean as a virgin hard disc, people used to tell stories, and there was such a thing as verbal communication. (And people didn't even have to use their thumbs to communicate, like today's simian-thumbed and simian-brained text messagers.) This film is all about the power of stories to stir the imagination and transform lives. Even as late as the 1960s, some old women still survived in the South who could tell stories for hours on end. They are all gone now, and it is like what happened after the time of Homer, when the last of the bards died. The best rendering in fiction of the 'power of stories' is probably the novella by Mircea Eliade entitled THE OLD MAN AND THE BUREAUCRATS. (Eliade wrote the story of Coppola's film YOUTH WITHOUT YOUTH, 2007, though that film was very disappointing and a poor adaptation.) The stories told by Jessica Tandy are about Idgie and Ruth. In those lengthy flashback sequences, the two young women are brilliantly portrayed by the two Mary's, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Mary-Louise Parker. Certainly this is one of the greatest 'sisterhood' films ever made. Their story is full of love, pain, pathos, loss, tragedy, and joy. Not unlike life. If you can see this without shedding a tear, then there is no hope for you. Good old Fannie, may she long keep flying her Flagg.",Fried Green Tomatoes
20,FiendishDramaturgy,Bittersweet Masterpiece In An Authentic Southern Setting.,9,31 March 2007,"Born and raised in lower Alabama, I found this work thoroughly enchanting. It truly depicts the life in thousands of little nowhere towns peppering the deep southern US from Georgia through Alabama, Mississippi, and select areas of Louisiana. But beyond that, this movie does more than enchant you with its whimsical Southern tones, and Georgia notes. It weaves a spell about you and transports you to 1930's Alabama, where it holds you in thrall until the bittersweet end.This is not a ""feel-good"" movie. It is not there for mere entertainment. It sits, and waits, for those who need its powers to heal the inner self, or who need guidance in the quest for a higher self.If you're able to understand its lessons, you will love this work as much as I do.It rates a 9.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",Fried Green Tomatoes
21,Lechuguilla,What An Authentic Flavor This Film Has,6,29 April 2005,"The twenty year friendship between two young women in the early twentieth century American South is the focus of this 1991 film from director Jon Avnet. Told in flashbacks, the story adopts a modern POV, with social empowerment being the theme. As such, the story is both unusual and unexpected, given its historical time frame. Viewers will be disappointed if they expect a more traditional Southern story ... about some dark, sinister secret emotionally repressed, and set among the lazy willows and old Magnolia trees.Empowerment can be a wonderful thing. But, if it is taken to extremes, as it is in two subplots, one involving Frank Bennett, and the other involving Evelyn Couch, then it can be a cause for concern. And that's my main problem with this film. The subplots tend to lack credibility, although they do not detract from the overall character study of Idgie and Ruth.What was most impressive to me was the film's atmospheric ""flavor"". Production design, set decoration, and costumes all sparkle with such vitality and detail, that you really feel like you're back in the rural South of the 1920's.Most modern films pander to youth. To its everlasting credit, ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" features the wisdom of an elderly character, played by Jessica Tandy, in a nursing home. An added bonus of the film is Kathy Bates, whose acting is always first-rate.",Fried Green Tomatoes
22,yusufpiskin,This film is so frustrating.,10,27 December 2019,"I loved this movie and couldn't believe it effectively handles more plot twists than a whole season of Golden Age television. I'd be rating this film a full 5 stars if it wasn't for the heartbreaking way Fried Green Tomatoes merely teases a lesbian romance for the ages. With a few minor script changes this film could have emboldened an entire generation of women to not just stand up to their lazy husbands but also express their love fully and brazenly. The costuming of Idgie constantly poses her as the most butch woman to ever step foot in Alabama, so having a handful of throwaway lines about having a husband later on really kills me. But other than the really unfortunate lesbian erasure Fried Green Tomatoes is one of the most enjoyable pieces of melodrama I've ever seen, the narrative leaps come fast and somewhat clunky at times, but if you can stick with it you'll have a good time. I'd be 100% into a way gayer remake starring Miranda July and Margaret Qualley in the past storyline, MAKE IT HAPPEN HOLLYWOOD!",Fried Green Tomatoes
23,NateWatchesCoolMovies,half of a great film,6,4 December 2016,"Fried Green Tomatoes is one of those films that presents two narratives, simultaneously woven together and unbound by the laws of past and present. A character from the present tells tales of the past, and the film jumps ever back and forth between the two, until a connection emerges. You've seen it in stuff like The Notebook, where it works beautifully, and both stories support each other. That's the issue with this film: One of the narratives is lovely and works quite well. The other? Mmmnot so much. Kathy Bates plays a hospice worker in a retirement home who is charmed by stories of life, freedom, injustice and romance from long ago, all told with wit and passion by an excellent Jessica Tandy. She tells of life growing up during the early 1900's in the American southwest, of free spirited tomboy Idgie (a fierce and emotional Mary Stuart Masterson), the girl she loves (Mary Louise Parker, radiant) and the whirlwind of trouble and conflict going on around them. Idgie lost her brother and best friend (a short lived and very young looking Chris O 'Donnell) to a horrible accident, and sort of has a lost pup complex, holding on to Parker for dear life and trying her best to extricate her from an abusive relationship with her monster of a husband (Nick Searcy is evil incarnate). It's whimsical, touching and flavored with just the right touches of sadness and danger. Now, the story with Bates in the present just feels aloof and silly. The scenes with her and Tandy fare better than glimpses of her home life and attempts to empower and change her for the better. Don't get me wrong, I love that idea, the notion of inspiration transcending time and the ability to help others simply with the spoken word and the wisdom of the past, but it just didn't work in this case. As for the scenes in the past, I fell hard for them. Masterson is a terrific actress who usually gets saddled with light, fluffy roles, but here gets a chance to let some raw emotion out. Parker is more reigned in but every bit as soulful, as the girl in a situation no one should have to endure, her soul practically screaming out through those beautiful brown eyes. I suppose you could say that it's half of a great film, that couldn't quite pull off it's own narrative flow.",Fried Green Tomatoes

This film tells the powerful story of Kathy Bates and Jessica Tandy in 1991. Kathy's character meets Tandy's character in a rest home while Kathy's husband is visiting his sick aunt. They quickly form a very special friendship and Jessica begins to tell Kathy stories about two women from years ago. Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary Louise Parker come in then, idgie and Ruth. Kathy starts to get inspired by the stories of idgie and Ruth and she starts to change her life for the better, getting into shape, improving her dull marriage with her husband, and becoming less scared to be herself and speak her mind. The stories told about idgie and Ruth involve going through tragedy, becoming lifelong friends and being there for each other. The performances in this sweet southern film are outstanding! Tandy and Bates are riveting and a joy to watch. Masterson and Parker have incredible on screen friend chemistry and their acting is nothing short of amazing, it's raw and real, you believe every thing they do and say. Cicely Tyson is good here too, a very brave and fearless character. The movie offers up great performances from the entire cast, very well written dialogue, heartwarming stories and a great score.

The film is very emotional, never maudlin, never disrespecting any of its components or the audience. It allows us to feel we are part of a world that might not exist anymore. What I like most about the film is how it embraces a passion for living.There is much to be admired about the technical aspects of the film as well. It travels back and forth in time, with a structure that is hard to describe but a joy to watch as it shows how the main relationships were born, developed, and eventually were transformed into something more spiritual.

It puts our problems of today to shame, as we mope because we don't like our jobs or we can't afford a new car.In particular the KKK parts really upset me. I just don't understand the mentality of people that can make others suffer for their alleged differences and I've never been one to accept violence as the answer to anything.I wonder if there is an underlying lesbian story not being told as the two girls are very close or do we as a society read too much in to everything today?

29,eric262003,Unsettling At Times But Has Some Sweet Tones,6,25 March 2019,"""Fried Green Tomatoes"" is a juxtapose of an emotional tearful drama with some light-heart comical moments that has similar veins to more superior and less manipulative films like ""Steel Magnolias"" and ""Crimes of the Heart"".What makes this movie not live up to its expectations was that they try to cover too much which at the result gets very little accomplished. Sure we understand that friendship and bonding is a very important commodity. It has a habit of pushing the envelop so much that the story it's trying to tell never fully settles and then we are left confused. The relationships portrayed here tend to lack in being believable and that we just have to take it like a pinch of salt, though the fans of this movie might be more accepting.The performers are what holds this movie together and they do everything in their power to keep us intrigued as they pour it to its audience splendidly. Their acting chops are so powerful they will get their message across even if they have to go a bit-over-the-top to get its message across. This could be bothersome to others, but by the end, the morals will etched in stone.Under the direction of Jon Avnet, ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" starred two hot actresses at the time. What I mean by hot I'm talking about Kathy Bates who won an Academy Award for her role in ""Misery"" and Jessica Tandy who won the Oscar for Best Actress for her role in ""Driving Miss Daisy"". In this movie, Bates plays the role of a lamented, middle-aged Evelyn Couch, a midwife who's not pleased about her marriage and her life in Birmingham, Alabama as her only source of comfort is consuming candy bars. Tandy plays the role of an aging nursing home resident named Ninny Threadgoode who becomes friends with Evelyn as she communicates with her by telling her an extended anecdote that has some connection to her past.Bates and Tandy earn a myriad of awards and accolades for their respected performances which is set in the present, but many flashbacks to Ninny's past also comes into affect as the story progresses.Though they were still unknown at the time, Mary Stuart Masterson does a wonderful job as Idgie Threadgoode her supposed sister-in-law, a tomboyish type who comes to the rescue of her friend Ruth Jamison (Mary-Louise Parker) who's in an abusive relationship with her husband, Frank Bennett (Nick Searcy) while also confronting other issues like racism, the KKK,male chauvinism, segregation and being framed as Sheriff Grady Kilgore (Gary Basaraba) for Frank's death only to later drop the charges against her.Parker who at the time was only known for her role in the AIDS themed movie ""Longtime Companion"" was effective in her performance as the long-suffering Ruth who found comfort with Idgie and when she's had enough of Frank's wrath, takes her belongings and helps run the business Idgie operates in the abandoned town of Whistle Stop, Alabama.Although this is based from the 1987 novel ""Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Shop Cafe"" by Fannie Flagg, she also gets credit for the screenplay as well as from Avnet and Carol Sobieski. This was the directorial debut for Avnet who beforehand served as a producer for ""Risky Business"" (with Tom Cruise) and also directed the 1986 TV movie ""Between Two Women"" starring Farrah Fawcett and Coleen Dewhurst.What ""Rambling Rose"" succeeded that ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" failed was the lack of handling the writers and directors had on the script. Avnet loosely gives Bates the green light to overdo it with the melodrama, especially at the beginning, the script is offering its audience scenes that weren't a necessity let alone saturated with dishonesty. There's the courtroom scene that is at times a bit ridiculous to watch and the outcome is predictable as our heroes actually to the courts and the officials just give in. Then we get an ending that is really hard to watch as Ninny explains the whole gruesome way Frank died. And then we are led to believe that someone is dead only to reveal, that they're really not.Though not the worst movie ever made, Bates eventually tones down in the latter scenes showcasing she can be entertaining to watch and can be subtle when given the chance. Tandy though advanced in age is still astoundingly effective and shows that her age will not slow her down. Even though she's been acting since the golden age of cinema, her later years have been the best. Through all of its red herrings, there is still plenty to like about this movie.",Fried Green Tomatoes
30,screenman,As good as it gets.,10,18 March 2006,"This movie might easily pass you by. It's quirky, long-winded title suggests something arty or perhaps comical in a needlessly pretentious way. Well; it is arty, and it is often funny, but there isn't a particle of pretentiousness. I got to see it only because my newspaper included it as a free DVD in the weekend issue. But for that, I might still be in ignorance now.It seems incredible that something so wonderful can be had for nothing.Kathy Bates plays the role of a mature but still comparatively young woman who has a marriage going nowhere. Her husband has reached the point where he just doesn't seem to care any more. Actually, it's not that he doesn't care; he just hasn't noticed how bad things have got. Like so many couples, they have just let themselves slip into a rut.However; she has noticed, and means to do something about it. When hints, make-overs and candlelit dinners prove inadequate, she finds unexpected inspiration in a feisty old woman called Ninny Threadgoode.This woman - played by Jessica Tandy - dilates upon her past, and in particular, a friendship between two young women called Idgie and Ruth (Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary Louise Parker). The movie then shifts between the present-day circumstances of an increasingly emancipated wife, and the flashback reminiscences of her inspiration.Some have rather misguidedly referred to this movie as a 'chick-flick' as if it were dedicated to a female audience or in some way espoused the cause of feminism. Such opinions do a disservice. To see it in this light, because the principal parts are female, is like dismissing 'The Shawshank Redemption' as a male 'buddy' movie. Both are about two people who's enduring friendship unites them against adversity. Lesbian love is barely hinted at.Director, Jon Aunet has created a spellbinding work. It has a wonderful, lyrical fidelity, like a Renoir painting, whereby the few moments of comedy appear as small, flagrant brush-strokes in an otherwise pastel completeness. There are moments of heartbreaking and tender subtlety when Thomas Newman's music score expresses human feeling more fluently than the spoken word.Sound-engineers seldom receive the recognition they deserve. All too easily we take the ambiance of the moment completely for granted. Viewers should pay particular attention to the authenticity of this movie, and marvel. The dreary interior of an unhappy home or the mildness of a sunlit summer-evening carry such authentic presence that one can almost feel the chill of anger, the sweetness of the season.Some have found fault with this movie somewhere. I confess to being too lachrymose to see anything other than the director's intentions. Excellent script, flawless acting, impeccably chosen music and ambiance to reach out and touch.This is a truly redeeming experience. Amongst the spoil-heaps of formulaic Hollywood wretchedness, gems like this help remind us that humanity is still worth caring about.The detail of life is what really gives us meaning.",Fried Green Tomatoes

The dominant flashback storyline is conventional and predictable and succumbs to cheap tearjerking tactics by the end, but is still far and away the more engaging aspect of the film; the contemporary framing sequences are well-acted by Tandy and Bates (despite the latter being a caricature that develops into a different caricature), but are also cutesy and obvious.

32,wisewebwoman,Wonderfully evocative,8,7 March 2007,"This is one of those movies that I take down from the shelf periodically and watch again. Mainly for the atmosphere it exudes. A time when railroads running through a town in North America made it come alive both financially and socially. So many themes are interwoven in this movie which takes place in the south of the Ku Klux Klan and delicate southern women. Here all is turned sideways and we emerge from the movie with a different and understanding perspective.The book on which this film is based (Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe by Fannie Flagg - she of Candid Camera fame for the older bunch out there)is far more complex in its telling with more story lines but here it is simplified for the film and understandably.The story is told in the present, with frequent flashbacks and narrated by the amazing Jessica Tandy in the role of Ms. Threadgoode, an older lady in a nursing home befriended by Evelyn Couch, played by the wonderful Kathy Bates. Evelyn becomes enthralled with the story and through hearing it starts to make positive changes in her own sad life.The back-story is of the 1930s in Alabama where two young women overcome adversity and partner in the running of a successful café. Through murder, racism, and an understated lesbian theme, Idgie Threadgoode (Mary Stuart Masterson) forms a solid and enduring bond with Ruth Jamison (Mary-Louise Parker).The supporting cast, which includes Cicely Tyson and a charming Chris O'Donnell work a magic that is quite mesmerizing. A few dropped threads (Buddy Junior, Idgie's marriage which didn't change her name in that era, a dangling ending) that were slightly unsatisfying but they did not spoil the overall feel for this classic. 8 out of 10.",Fried Green Tomatoes

34,gftbiloxi,"Sentiment, Soap Opera, A Dash of Comedy, and a Gallon of Gloss",7,2 October 2005,"Fannie Flag's interesting novel gets a gallon of gloss in this very Hollywood movie clearly created with a female audience in mind. The result is a well performed but occasionally uneasy mixture of sentiment, comedy and soap opera.In terms of story, the film operates on two levels. An increasingly frustrated middle aged woman living in Alabama (Bates) examine her life and finds it sadly lacking--but by chance she makes the acquaintance of a nursing home resident (Tandy) whose stories of the past encourage the woman to take charge of her life. The stories she tells are shown through flashback, and concern two depression-era women (Mary Louise Parker and Mary Stuart Masterson) who owned and operated a ramshackle diner in a small hard-times town called whistle stop.The present-day story emphasizes comedy while the depression-era story tends more toward soap opera elements, and the two stories sometimes prove an uneasy mix. A great fuss is often made over the implied lesbian relationship between the two leads in the depression-era story, but I myself find this more in the eye of the beholder than in the actual film; it rather depends on how you read the characters.Much of the film is enjoyable, particularly in its performances with Bates a standout. The dreamy quality in which the depression-era story is presented is also nicely done. But the action is sometimes slow and the tone is both predictable and manipulative; I can almost hear the director telling me ""laugh now; cry now"" as the film progresses. Enjoyable for one, perhaps even two viewings, but not a film to which I greatly care to return--I'll take the more interesting novel instead.Gary F.

36,jpschapira,Leaving a message...,8,9 December 2008,"There's no other way to put it; there are films that just make you feel good. These films are reasonably called 'feel good' movies; you may watch them and have a good time and a week later forget everything about them: ""In Good Company"" comes to mind. Other films also make you feel good but also leave an impression, because of the memorable characters they contain and you want to keep close to your heart: ""Barbershop"" is the perfect example. But there are also 'feel good' movies that break their own rule, scratch the surface looking for something more and they find it: leaving a message. Jon Avnet's ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" tells a straight story, the one David Lynch waited so many years to tell. Based on a book by Fannie Flagg, the movie introduces us to Evelyn Couch (a sensational Kathy Bates), a woman who's having a mid-life crisis and who's visiting his husband Ed's (Gailard Sartain) aunt at a nursing home. But this aunt doesn't like her, throws things at her and she has to sit outside and wait. And there comes an 83-year-old lady who seems so full of life that we envy her. This is Ninny Threadgoode, played by Jessica Tandy as the most caring, comprehensive, friendly, lovable woman you could meet. It's from her that we learn the main story, in a movie that contains many stories. Because everyone has a story, and sometimes two people share the same story, and nobody can imagine them in different contexts, like Idgie (Mary Stuart Masterson) and Ruth (Mary-Louise Parker). In two fantastic performances that depend on each other, Masterson plays Idgie as a rebellious girl who slowly understands what true love and being mature means; while Parker's work represents exactly the opposite. At first, we see Ruth as a quiet lady (always a lady) who follows the Bible's rules by heart and, over the years, she seems to let go, and while never forgetting her values, starts to live a little more freely and holding on to the ones who love her the most.These aren't stereotypes, but basic descriptions, sketches, of two characters that will helplessly grow on you as they grow on each other with time; and of their story, which I want to let you discover. Making use of a classic resource as narration, Avnet lets Tandy's character take us back in time to Ruth and Idgie's world. It's a beautiful world, a beautiful little town and a beautiful Café where these women serve fried green tomatoes that Avnet also displays and shoots classically. The music, by Thomas Newman, is also classic, non- intrusive in a sense.So there's no risk in what we see on screen, and no risk in the story either; the tale is predictable and the 'intrigue' plot-line it contains could have been resolved differently. But Avnet risks everything in one aspect, and that's where his movie succeeds. He utterly trusts his main actors (his four main actresses, more accurately) in the creation of the characters I told you about; and they respond, making every word sound true. That's why we don't question that characters tell the same story three times and nothing feels clichéd, that's why the connection that Evelyn has with two people she never met is intensely real. You may wonder, after all this, what the message I'm talking about is. It's quite simple actually: that friendship conquers all, friendship beats all odds; the friends we meet along the way make us who we are. There are so many films that struggle so hard to get that simple message through and it never happens. ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" achieves it and still kindly leaves some things unsaid for us to meditate; and it makes us feel good, and it makes us want to eat these fried green tomatoes, whatever they are.",Fried Green Tomatoes

39,oOoBarracuda,"""I'm too young to be old and too old to be young.""",7,9 May 2016,"""I'm too young to be old and too old to be young.""Such a quote spoken by Kathy Bates' character in the 1991 film by Jon Avnet Fried Green Tomatoes speaks to the heart of anyone who has ever transitioned from one stage of life to another. This film beautifully juxtaposes two women as they transition to two very different points in their lives. Discovering oneself and making the most out of the life we are given are points to take home from Avnet's tale. Points that any living being has felt before, and will undoubtedly feel again. Bored, listless, and underwhelmed by her life and her marriage, Evelyn Couch (Kathy Bates) is tired of her life as a thankless housewife. In a twist of fate, while visiting her husband's aunt in a nursing home, Evelyn meets Ninny Threadgoode (Jessica Tandy) an outgoing senior with a larger than life personality. Ninny is happy to have a visitor and Evelyn is happy to have something to do with her days, so the visits between the two women become frequent and regular. Ninny tells the tale of Idgie Threadgoode (Mary Stuart Masterson) and her life in the south in the 1920's. Evelyn becomes enthralled with Ninny's tales, returning regularly to hear the next installment, being inspired to better herself in the process. The audience sees Evelyn make the transformation from a demure fruitless existence to one in which she takes pride in herself and her body, becomes a beauty consultant and takes control of her marriage. The time shared between Ninny and Evelyn becomes less about the subjects of Ninny's stories, which are nonetheless captivating, and more about the bond between women, and the amazing power of uplift that human beings can bring to each other if practiced often enough.Fried Green Tomatoes opens with a wonderful establishing scene in which Evelyn gives her husband Ed Couch incorrect directions to a nursing home that houses his aunt, who we soon find out is no fan of Evelyn. The scene is beautiful in its ability to transform the audience to where the story is taking place, and bring the audience into Alabama. This film is largely based on its fantastic dialogue moving the story along, so other camera and film techniques were minimal as to not distract from the dialogue heavy script. One great aspect of dialogue-laden films are the long shots usually packed into them. One great example of a beautiful long shot was the scene in which someone that meant very much to Idgie passed away in Ninny's storytelling. Idgie is seen standing at a window talking her loved one to impending death while standing centered in a window on the opposite side of the room. Idgie, at this point, is standing at the precipice of a new life without the one that has meant so much to her and helped her get through her own life's struggles. She is unsure how she will go on, but seeing the vast remainder of her life, like that of the seemingly never-ending field in view out the window, Idgie is determined to persevere. The perseverance expressed through Ninny's story is exactly what Evelyn needed to take control of her life and bring her existence a greater purpose. This kind of exceptional bond between women is the backbone of the film, and a relatable much-needed force for audiences everywhere.",Fried Green Tomatoes

42,bbewnylorac,Beautiful movie,8,8 February 2015,"Sure it's a tiny bit corny, but Fried Green Tomatoes is a gem of a movie. It's amazing, in the era of beautiful people and fast paced stories, that it got made at all, but I guess it helped that its stars Kathy Bates and Jessica Tandy had both recently won Oscars for other movies. This film doesn't insult its audience. I like how it tells the tale in a roundabout way through the miserable, modern day housewife (Bates) befriending a sparky elderly woman (Tandy) she meets while visiting another resident at a nursing home. It turns out the elderly lady played merely a bit part and was a young girl, an observer, in the real life juicy tale she starts to tell about rural southern life in the old days, but it tells us a lot about the close ties of a large family and friends in a more innocent time. And she's a great story teller, and Bates's character is taken out of her depression and gains a good friend who suggests ways she can get out more and get over her problems. A simple tale, but a lovely one, with lots of wicked humour and a touch of the macabre.",Fried Green Tomatoes

44,roghache,Touching if flawed tale of Southern women's friendships,6,7 May 2006,"This is definitely an engaging, amusing, and moving film...a tribute to the power of friendship, viewed through two sets of relationships between women. One is the friendship that develops between a middle aged woman and an elderly lady in a nursing home. The other is the strong bond between two younger women from a bygone era. I appreciated the Southern setting, with its verandahed home, al fresco wedding reception, and so forth. However, I do have a few complaints to be discussed later.The film relates a story within a story, both set in Alabama. It begins with an unhappily married, insecure, overweight middle aged woman, Evelyn Couch, who is generally trodden upon by others and deals with her problems by eating compulsively. While visiting her husband's aunt in a facility for seniors, she befriends an octogenarian resident named Ninny Threadgoode. Over the course of several months, Ninny gradually relates a tale which causes an amazing transformation in Evelyn. This 'inner story' involves two young women from the 1930's, Idgie Threadgoode and Ruth Jamison, who become friends after a dramatic event in Idgie's childhood involving her brother, Buddy, Ruth's beau. The sharing of this experience leads to a warm friendship between the pair. Idgie later rescues Ruth from an abusive relationship with her despicable husband, Frank, and the women set up & operate a diner called the Whistle Stop Cafe, whose specialty is fried green tomatoes.The actresses are brilliant in their roles. The incredible Jessica Tandy plays Ninny, with Kathy Bates in the role of the unhappy housewife, Evelyn. Marie-Louise Parker is totally endearing as Ruth, the sweet, strait laced, and gentle victim of spousal abuse. Mary Stuart Masterson perfectly captures the wild, feisty, poker playing, no nonsense Idgie. My compliments also to Chris O'Donnell (Buddy), Stan Shaw (Big George), and Cecily Tyson (his mother, Sipsey). The wonderful child actress who portrays the tomboyish younger Idgie bears an uncanny resemblance to the adult version. Both friendship stories are well captured. Evelyn's newfound older friend, Ninny, has in a relatively short period of time a profound effect on Evelyn's life, causing her to improve her diet & exercise habits and become more assertive in her relationships. Consequently this elicits a tremendous sense of gratitude, such that her loyalty to Ninny might be viewed as surpassing her commitment to her husband (not particularly the best message). As for Idgie and Ruth, they experience a profoundly moving friendship & deep loyalty, sharing laughs (the food fight!) as well as trials and pain. A lesbian relationship is not specified, but I personally detected sexual undertones in Idgie's attitude. Their relationship is ambiguous and it would have been a more effective tribute to the power of friendship if the platonic nature had been made crystal clear. Much as I like Jessica Tandy, I found Evelyn's tale all a wee bit foolish & stereotypical and would just have soon had only ONE story, the 1930's characters.From my own (female) perspective, my complaints lie mainly with its feminist philosophies. Why must movies about strong relationships between women invariably have the male roles either oppressive monsters or absolute jerks? Here Frank is a horrendous wife beater and Evelyn's husband, Ed, the stereotypical unappreciative, uncaring idiot obsessed with TV sports and beer. I have a bit of news for screenwriters...women happily married to reasonable husbands can have strong friendships, too. Also, it's the classic scenario of portraying the housewife (Evelyn) as unfulfilled without a job outside the home. The parking lot scene is amusing but frankly, I found her Women's Awareness Group utterly ridiculous and an insult to the intelligence of all women. Aside from the feminist issues, the film also gives (predictably) a rather negative portrayal of the Reverend. In any case, this movie should be required viewing for spousal abusers! Others have compared it to Steel Magnolias, which also revolves around friendships between Southern women. Fried Green Tomatoes explores these relationships in greater depth (especially the one between Ruth & Idgie) but personally, I preferred Steel Magnolias, which focuses on the mother-daughter bond. However, Fried Green Tomatoes is definitely a captivating tale with some unforgettable and heart wrenching moments as well as amusing scenarios, including certain aspects of the ending, which I won't divulge but are something of a hoot!",Fried Green Tomatoes
45,coldwaterpdh,A hearty slice of American history and feminism.,9,5 November 2008,"To say that ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" is the best chick flick ever made would be true, but at the same time it would be a huge misrepresentation of a great story with serious messages for everyone.The best thing about this movie is the way it captures the essence of the American south, for better or worse. Small town people were confused and beautiful at once in the 1940's and no film I've seen besides maybe ""In The Heat of the Night"" paints that picture a well as ""Fried Green Tomatoes."" I think the lesbian undertones here are shown very realistically and tastefully unlike many other films where lesbians are portrayed as man-bashing brutes, this film shows the tender side of the friendships that often spawn relationships beyond friendship. The two main characters are caught in a time and place where that is impossible to display but they manage to be happy.The story weaves together traditional Southern values with modern American women's issues and guess what? A modern woman would learn a whole lot about what it means to be strong and independent from the lessons of an old southern belle.Absolutely essential viewing that is too often overlooked, if you're looking for a chick flick to watch with your girlfriend or wife that won't put you to sleep or make you need a shot of Jack Daniels afterwards to feel like a man again, ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" is your best bet.9 out of 10, kids.",Fried Green Tomatoes
46,flingebunt,Fried cheesy plot ideas at the schmaltz café,3,12 May 2005,"No nation is capable of producing movies that just aimed at tugging people's heart strings without a single original idea or anything to say.The story unfolds in two parts. Firstly there is the present day where we have to put up with the rather annoying Evelyn Couch who has a so called failing marriage with her husband. She meets a woman at an aged care facility and so we are introduced to the story of Idgie and Ruth and the whistle stop café.What we encounter is a whole range of rather lame plot points strung together for little effect. The café of the title has no significance to the plot. Ruth's abusive husband has no depth. He hits her because he hits her....it goes not further.Idgie is mostly a female Huck Finn. Of course being set in the south you have to have a fat sheriff and the KKK.Worst of all, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't see the relationship with the present day. They are just two separate stories.I figure this movie was made as a Yankee plot to make southerners look dull and stupid. One of the worst out of a batch of cheesy reminiscence stories.",Fried Green Tomatoes
47,chron,Storytelling at Its Best,9,25 March 2001,"I enjoyed this movie immensely.  This is one of the best examples of storytelling that I have seen.  The structure of the movie - alternating between the past and present, with multiple intertwining plots - keeps the viewer hooked on how the story will unfold.  It unfolds gracefully and is enjoyable throughout.The acting is exceptional.  Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary Louise Parker carry the bulk of the acting load.  They are fantastic.  The relationship between these very different young women is complex and satisfying.Since the movie is about women and the female roles are so strong, this movie has been dubbed a ""chick flick"", but that pejorative is unfair.  This is good film making and those who like plot-driven cinema will enjoy this immensely.  This one is in my DVD collection.",Fried Green Tomatoes
48,fimimix,"..if you weren't there in those days, you can't judge this film...",10,2 May 2006,"I read every comment - I was shocked at how some people thought it was disgusting or ""boring"" - perhaps because the story had no violence in it? I can attest that this movie is authentic in its depicting of the rural south in the '20s and '30s - I was living at that time.Is there NO ONE who remembers an ancient film (according to the ages of most of the commentaries) named ""Some of My Best Friends Are"" ? This is a flagrant, gay film about a gay bar - and Ms. Flagg just happens to be in it! That film, too, is authentic in showing how dangerous is was to be gay in the time-frame it is written for. If you can find it, don't miss it. If you saw ""Midnight Cowboy"" and paid attention to the gay characters in it, you can imagine that ""Rico"" died of the deadly form of pneumonia caused by AIDS. The ""cowboy's"" love for ""Rico"" is an example of how Idgie and Ruth loved one another - love isn't ALWAYS sexual.The point I am making here is, who would ever think a woman whom the light-hearted comedy Ms. Flagg was known for could ever write such a heavy novel? In the film, her development of her characters is certainly true-to-life and thought-provoking - brilliant. As many commentaries attest, the movie-direction-lighting-editing-EVERYTHING about the film is perfect. An aside: I am a female-impersonator, stand-up comedian: the joke Kathy Bates acted-out about ""I'm older and have more money"" is an OLD joke we performers have been telling for decades. Guess Ms. Flagg - or someone connected to the making of this film - knew about it. I was pleasantly surprised to see......Those young people who made intelligent commentaries on ""Tomatoes"" are special people, to be able to understand there WAS life before the age of ""blow-'em-up"" film-making. Those films are entertaining, too, but do we really need textbooks on how to be violent? ""Chick-flick"" ? - what a narrow-minded opinion ! This film shows us that males and females are all human.....what a redeeming quality ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" has shown us. I'd rate it 20.......",Fried Green Tomatoes

We learn early on that Idgie will be accused of murder and put to trail, but we are not told whether she did it or not. The other story is told by Ninny Threadgood an elderly woman in a hospital who has become friends with a depressed you woman played by Kathy Bates and tels her the above story.

55,possumopossum,Nostalgia,8,28 August 2007,"As a native of Birmingham, Alabama, I thought they did a very good job of recreating Irondale. I would almost swear that parts of this film were actually filmed there. Also, I can remember when Fannie Flagg co-hosted a local morning show in Birmingham. I used to watch it every morning while I was getting ready for school. She was also a weather forecaster for our local TV station. She sure came a long way since then.Not much changed in Alabama between the twenties and the time I grew up there, and seeing this movie brought back memories of all those good home-cooked Southern meals. Fried okra, fried green tomatoes, fried squash, and good old Alabama barbecue. Alabama has the best barbecue in the nation.Folks in Alabama take their food seriously, and they also take friendships seriously. I guess that's why it is so easy to read things into Idgey and Ruth's relationship that may not be there. (Lesbianism? In Alabama? In the 20s and 30s? Get real, people!!!) Anyone even suspected of such behavior in Alabama back then would have been unceremoniously lynched. So, let's try not to read too much into Idgie's and Ruth's friendship, huh? Evelyn's and Ninny's friendship is very moving for anyone who has ever had a friend that changed them, that gave them the strength to keep going when all hope seemed to be lost. And I think posters are being a little too hard on her husband. Ed seems like essentially a good man. He just falls into the same trap that most of us men fall into. We allow ourselves to get too caught up in our own little worlds to pay much mind to what makes our wives ache and thrill. (Come on, fellows, we're all guilty of that sometimes. Be honest.) Throughout the movie, Ed shows that he is devoted to his wife, even if he is totally oblivious to what is going on in her life.This movie reminds me of STAND BY ME, because it makes you want to laugh and cry at the same time and it gives you a snapshot of a time and place that is gone forever. A gem of a film. 8 out of 10.",Fried Green Tomatoes

The actresses Jessica Tandy, Mary Stewart Masterson, Mary Louise Parker and Kathy Bates simply rule their roles. I also love Fannie Flagg who I first watched a Match Game and simply blown away by her story telling.The plot revolves around two lifelong friends Idgie and Mary and two older women played by Tandy and Bates. They each took their roles to the nth degree and lived it. Every character came to life from the actors who portrayed them.It's hard to also believe that this movie is the work of fiction. It feels so real as if the actors are playing real people instead of characters created for the story/movie. Every character was casted perfectly, there were no actor who I felt was miscasted.For the movie itself, it's beyond easy to get lost in the story. I love movies that pulls you in and refuses to release you till the end. I can only think off hand a couple that does that exact same thing. One being ""The Notebook"". Same story telling and like ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" a work of fiction. Funny cause the main base is simply but the story is so complex. I cannot recommend a movie more than I can this one.

62,Supachewy,An Overly Sentimental FIlm,5,16 September 2010,"The drama Fried Green Tomatoes is directed by Jon Avnet and stars Kathy Bates, Jessica Tandy, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Mary-Luise Parker. The film takes place in modern day Alabama with flashbacks from 1920 Alabama.The film starts off with a little girl in 1920s Alabama named Idgie Threadgood who does not want to be a part of her sister's wedding. After being talked to by her older brother she agrees to go to it and then afterward the two of them plus the girl the brother likes, Ruth (Parker) go on a walk around the area. When Ruth's hat flies off Idgie's brother goes and gets it for her but his foot ends up stuck in a train track and he is tragically killed. Idgie is extremely disturbed by her brother's death and is never the same again. This is all told from her sister Ninny Threadgood (Tandy) to Evelyn Couch (Bates). Couch is a middle aged woman who does not believe that she has any power or purpose and she met Ninny in a nursing home while visiting her husband's aunt. As the film goes on it develops the relationship between Idgie and Ruth and also Ninny and Evelyn and it is very sentimental...The script was written by Fannie Flagg who also wrote the book which the film is based on. Personally I thought the writing was weak for one main reason. That reason is that the film bounced between two different stories. The story with Idgie and Ruth was quite interesting but the story with Evelyn and Ninny was a complete bore that lacked depth. It was basically Evelyn just saying I have no purpose and then becoming a crazy woman that just tears apart her home and it is all supposedly because of Ninny's story. It is just not believable. It would have been better if it was more like Ninny just telling the story to Evelyn and Evelyn not having a story of her own.The first feature film for the big screen of Jon Avnet proved that he is a decent director. Avnet got solid performances by all his leads which is hard to do in a cast with four leads. The shots in the film were not really impressive and he did not really make me care much for any of the characters. I would have said that he did a poor job if he did not get the performances that he did, but then again it was only his first film even though he has not proved to be much of a director today in any way.The acting in this film was the best part of it. All four of the leads gave great performances. Even Kathy Bates, whose character I thought to be the weakest written still was able to bring a great performance out of it. Yet she is one of the greatest actresses who ever lived. Jessica Tandy even earned an Oscar nomination for her performance just because she was so great being an eccentric old lady. Parker and Masterson are sort of newcomers to the lead position and they really pulled it off as well. The acting made this film bearable.Overall I give this film a 5/10, I would have gave lower if it was not for the strong performances. I would recommend this to anyone who likes period pieces or films with strong female leads.",Fried Green Tomatoes

It is about friendship and love and how friendship and love can sustain women through hard times and crises. Idgie gives Ruth strength and Ruth gives Idgie redemption. Without Idgie's strength, Ruth would have buried and broken by her violent husband. Without Ruth's love, Idgie's wildness would have destroyed her in the end. They became more than the sum of their parts. Ninnie's early life had been so full of love, from Idgie & Ruth, from her husband and son, that it still illuminates her present life, even though she old and in a nursing home. Ninnie gave some of that love and strength to Evelyn and helped Evelyn survive her journey to self enlightenment. I love this movie.

One day, at the hospice, she finds a nice old woman, becomes her friend and starts listening to a breathtaking story (in third person) about a simple restaurant at the train station where good girls served tasteful fried green tomatoes, in the 1930s.It's more than just a gossip story. The simple, genuine youth of these girls is more enviable than millions others. Life was hard those years, too little rights for women were acknowledged yet, and this movie insists on this theme, but everything is balanced with a (even involuntary!) spontaneous humor, never fading inside pure feminism or inappropriate fields. Furthermore, the way it's edited, mixing the narrated story with amusing sketches of today (the scene at supermarket parking is memorable!), grows in us the same interesting of Evelyn in the story and the characters it's populated of. Nothing happens simplifying or sweetening reality, no, Avnet doesn't look for shortcuts. The story is essentially sad and has a surprisingly grotesque implications (do you know what I mean ?!) you'll never expect. Idgie personifies the will to live, beyond difficulties and odds, arousing then Evelyn's admiration. She realized to be a ""Ruth"" and wanted to become a ""Idgie"" with her husband, finding the strength to change.Good for the whole family, I hope you'll find it great (and with a better soundtrack could have been greater) as it's for me.",Fried Green Tomatoes
71,ltj36,Your best friend lasts forever,10,3 March 2000,"My favorite moment in this movie is when Jessica Tandy says to Kathy Bates that the most important thing in life ""Are friends. Best friends"". It's easy to understand (for those who also read my comment for ""Stand By Me"") why I love this movie. This is a movie about two true friendships, those where there's a person who saves the life of another, only because she loves that person. The 4 actresses are great to describe this, helped by the iron screenplay by Fannie Flagg and Carol Sobieski and the splendid soundtrack by Thomas Newman. I wonder if someone recognized his/her friends here. I did and I love this perfect, tender and beautiful movie for that.",Fried Green Tomatoes
72,Arlis,Kathy Bates is the best thing about this one.,3,18 December 2006,"I watched this with a friend the other day and I had a pretty good idea what I was getting myself into. Its written by a woman it stars women and its set in the south. Can you say chick flick.I knew my grandpa loved the movie and considered it his fave and he had somewhat decent taste in movies, but this just didn't have that comedy feel to it. I walked away feeling as if I had watched a lifetime movie of the week.Jessica Tandy is a sweet old woman who has played in a handful of movies I like throughout the years. Stan Shaw is the man and I was glad to see him here although his role in this movie was rather boring.The Couch family was the best reason for watching the movie Gailard Sartain is just one of those 80's actors who always played the same silly character in most of his movies but he was always fun to watch. Kathy bates was doing one of her many 'out there' roles as she played the lonely in love Mrs Couch and I loved seeing her on this film.It is basically a movie where Kathy Bates character meets Jessica Tandy's character in an old folks home and is told a story about a girl and a boy and a best friend and that best friends abusive husband and about the kkk and fried green tomatoes and the whistle stop café.The story was told over numerous visits to the old folks home and the story bored me silly, I did as I mentioned above, love the parts with Kathy Bates in between.This movie wasn't funny really, but it was dramatic and if you're into the whole chick flick thing then go for it. Its one of those movies your grandparents would like. I am glad I watched it, but never wanna see it again.",Fried Green Tomatoes

74,mark-4522,Typically Politically Correct Hollywood Propaganda,7,13 March 2015,"Here's the real summary of the film: The story is a flashback about two women, a butch feminist rescuing a ""femme"", helpless woman from her racist, abusive Southern husband (is there any other kind?) She kills the husband and feeds the body to unwitting, stupid Southerners as BBQ. haha! Jokes on those stupid Southerners! Happy ending for Hollywood. During the film, the women grow together with grrl power and start their own business (because that's the path to feminine empowerment) and befriend weak men they are able to use to help make them more powerful.If you liked this, then you'll love Thelma and Louise which is a similar type of grrl power film. Another film with a similar theme is the Emma Stone vehicle The Help which features African servants spilling the secrets of privileged white Southern women (which I found funny in retrospect because when Hollywood stars got hacked and had their nude pictures posted on the web, they got all upset about the invasion of privacy.) These films are useful to watch to see the contempt Hollywood has for the working class people that keep them fat and happy.",Fried Green Tomatoes
75,kemkomacar,"This movie should be a lesson for ""modern"" filmmakers",7,25 October 2019,"In recent years, filmmakers severely compromised the idea of a good storytelling by putting diverse characters unnecessarily into the plots, just for the sake of diversity. The story should come first or at least it should be compatible with the composition of the characters. Otherwise, the viewer would notice this forced attitude at storytelling. Some might enjoy such interventions but I beg to differ.In that regard, this movie did a fantastic job, almost three decades ago. A woman helps the empowerment of two women from different timelines. Albeit not agressively she also takes a stand against racism. There is even an implied homosexual attraction between two female characters. And the movie does all things without compromising its authenticity, nothing feels forced to me.To modern filmmakers: If you would like to have diversity in your movie, write your script accordingly, build your story onto diverse characters. Don't write generic plots and expect us to believe that you are somewhat sensitive person ,and not to cash on diversity trend, just because you let the minorities represent themselves.",Fried Green Tomatoes
76,Iammymothersdaughter2,Strong Southern Women in these troubled times.,10,9 October 2001,"This film's cinematography and musical score alone make it a worthwhile experience. Both have that almost-unreal-they're-so-perfect quality that give you the good kind of goosebumps.The story is played out so faultlessly by each of the actors in this movie that you're never for one second anything but totally enthralled and engrossed.  The film's main story lines revolve around southern women, in old and modern times, and the bonds of friendship that are at once so tender and so unbreakably strong.  Jessica Tandy's portrayal of Ms. Ninny Threadgood had to be my favorite if forced to choose.  The way she faced life unafraid and with sympathy and humor just warmed your whole being, say nothing of your heart.  But each and every actor in this film brought their very best, and no one disappointed.I'm probably too naive, but the homosexual overtones that several friends of mine said existed in the movie were totally lost on me - perhaps because I'm lucky enough to have a precious few friendships like the ones portrayed here, and there is nothing of the sort in those friendships.  I did read the book only after watching this film, and Ms. Flagg does present a totally different light on that particular subject than is in the movie - I'd recommend both the movie and the book - both are wonderful and thought provoking.",Fried Green Tomatoes

I'm not real sure I enjoyed this movie because I guess I like cutesy better. If you want realistic this is your movie. I really felt I was watching real life. Now the good things. The food throwing in the kitchen was great especially funny when Idgie spread chocolate frosting on Grady. When the minister Scroggins testified that Ingie was at a three day revival when Bennit disappeared I couldn't believe it until I was told the book was Moby Dick and not the bible. Pretty funny the way they cooked up Bennit and served him to the law man. The actual murder scene was quite anti-climatic as everything had been settled by then. Worth seeing? Yes.

79,Tyler-Durden,"Nice movie, read my comment on it.",10,5 March 2000,"""Fried Green Tomatoes"" is a great name for this movie. I saw it a long (very long) time ago, but I do remember most of it.This movie has many factors that make it excellent, one of these is Mary Stuart Masterson's performance. She definitely has talent. Also, the way Jessica Tandy narrates the whole story is fantastic.Tandy's story is changing the life of Kathy Bates in the present (most of the movie is about the past). The ending is pretty nice and happy, showing us that Tandy was Idgie. (M. S. Masterson in the past)The racism subject is very realistic, it shows how white people had no mercy for the black people, how they punish them, just because they were black.It's very funny the fact that after killing that man who was hitting Idgie's friend Ruth (Mary-Louise Parker) they cook him. And the investigator tastes him, and he actually likes the food. That's where the phrase comes: ""The secret is in the sauce"".Idgie's personality and strong character keeps the movie alive at some moments, along with her kindness. This movie is really beautiful and it should be seen by every movie fan alive.I'll rate it with a 10 out of 10. Go see it as soon as you can if you haven't already.",Fried Green Tomatoes

Go ahead and be ready to laugh, and also to tear up over some of the scenes. This is a well-acted, well directed, and enjoyable film in the solid time-honored tradition of totally watchable Grade B movies. Some of the characters portrayed are people a viewer can get to know for a few hours and really sympathize with. Other's behavior you can get mad at. You might even want to express a little outrage at some behavior portrayed. Enjoy it. The film has its flaws, but for the most part is one the sensitive and discerning viewer can see more that once and be happier with than much of the real trivial tripe that passes for film these days.

84,voxparody,The Color Lavender,7,7 May 2005,"Evelyn Couch (Kathy Bates) subsists on Krispy Kreme donuts and low self-esteem. Her fat slug of a husband is oblivious to the attention she so desperately craves; he would rather plop in front of the set to watch his baseball game, and wolf down the wonderful meals she dutifully prepares. Soon, Evelyn befriends Mrs. Threadgoode, an octogenarian woman living her last days at a retirement home. Through their friendship, two beautiful stories begin to unravelone takes place in 1930s Alabama, and one in the present. Through this parallel-storytelling technique, Evelyn comes to realize the beauty of love and develops a healthy perseverance towards personal fulfillment.If you haven't seen this little movie, by all means sit a spell and share it with your best friends. There is nothing more soothing than experiencing the sights and sounds of a bygone country summer: rocking slowly inside screened-in porches, the song of crickets and katydids, eating southern-fried chicken, and drinking ice-cold sarsaparilla soda right out of the bottle. Don't be fooled, though. The film also has its share of heavy-handed yet serious drama, so be prepared for a truly unique Sunday morning 'barbecue.' Actors Bates and Tandy are fantastic as, respectively, Evelyn and Mrs. Threadgoode. Bates is especially endearing as Evelyn, and Tandyas usualturns in an engagingly eccentric role as the seemingly dotty old biddy with a sensitive heart and a sweet-fillingher character is a walking historical-journal ready to be opened and read. Masterson and Parker, however, lack the sufficient chops to match the superior-quality of the older actresses' thespian-talent.Somehow, Masterson and Parker (playing Depression Era fictional best-friends) are mismatched within essencetheir symbolic (1991) contemporaries. The overall narrative faintly resembles something written by Alice Walker, were Walker an Anglo-Saxon instead of a black novelist.FYI: Author/screenwriter/actress Fannie Flagg was a regular player on the TV game show Match Game.",Fried Green Tomatoes
85,mwpressley,A tale of friendship in the South,10,18 October 2000,"Fried Green Tomatoes is one of my all time favorite movies.  Beautifully filmed, this movie shares with its audience the tale of two women who become best friends and share loss, joy and adventures together. The movie starts in the present where Bates' character becomes friends with an older lady in the nursing home played by Jessica Tandy. Through this older lady, Bates begins to heart the story of two women who grew up in the early 1900's named Idgie Thresgood (played by the fabulous Mary Stuart-Masterson) and Ruth (Mary Louise-Parker).  Idgie is a hellion wild child and Ruth is a straight-laced reserved woman. The two become close friends and the story follows the different difficulties and triumphs these two women face. The story manages to keep a delicate balance between the drama, comedy and different times this story takes place well.  A beautiful Southern locale, excellent actresses and a wonderful script make this movie a classic.  I give it a rating of ten because this movie is a moving, smile-provoking piece of work. Also has one of the best parking lot rage scenes of all times.",Fried Green Tomatoes
86,tanya_lamb,"A warm, well acted film with sexual overtones",8,5 July 2002,"While I love this film, and have seen it a dozen times at least, the maturing of my mind since the first time I saw it as a teen in 1991, have made me take a second look at this stunningly acted film about love, friendship, devotion and racial issues in a multiple decade look at women's roles in society.Anyone who went to college where I did would see that Idgy from her childhood is the sterotypical Lesbian.  She does not like to wear dresses and prefers a man's dress even as a youngster.  As she ages, and as Ruth befriends her, she is tantalized by a kiss Ruth gives her on the cheek at the swimming hole and so devastated by Ruth's wedding that she does not even attend but instead drives hours to Valdosta, Georgia to look on hurtfully from the woods at Ruth carried in her new home in her wedding dress.
As the film progresses and Ruth is rescued from her abusive relationship the two start a cafe called Whistle Stop Cafe in Whistle Stop, Alabama.  If one watches carefully they'll see that the two live together in a house near the cafe.  In one poignant moment, the two women are talking over coffee late at night in the cafe when Ruth says that she feels bad that Idgy may feel she needs to stay and care for Ruth and Buddy Threadgoode Jr. (Buddy is Ruth's son but has Idgy's last name?!)  Ruth says that if it weren't for she and Buddy, Idgy may ""settle down"" Idgy dramatically replies ""I am as settled as I am ever going to be"" and ""I don't want you to move out""  The clincher was the image they showed shortly after that scene of Ruth in a feminine dress and Idgy in shorts and a shirt and tie, holding each other and smiling. Idgy never married or dated and Ruth never remarried.Everyone must come to their own conclusion but mine is two women in the 1930's who enjoy a healthy, loving lesbian relationship with the disguise of business partners in a time and place when different anything race, religion or creed, was just not tolerated or accepted.",Fried Green Tomatoes
87,StClair59,Fried Green Tomatoes (At The Whistle Stop Cafe)!,9,3 February 2008,"My mother, sister, and I love this movie. The characters, Evelyn (Kathy Bates), Ninny (Jessica Tandy), Idgie (Mary Stuart Masterson), and Ruth (Mary-Louise Parker) are awesome. Even though Fried Green Tomatoes was actually filmed somewhere in Georgia, it is actually supposed to be set in Alabama (my home state!!!). There really is (or was) a Whistle Stop Cafe in Irondale, Alabama, and someday I would like to eat there. This movie rocks! And, those of you who say Fried Green Tomatoes is a gay movie and that Idgie is a lesbian-Stop saying that! My mom, sister, dad, and I have seen this movie several times, and there's no gay going on in it. Plus, Idgie is *not* a lesbian; she's just a tomboy.

Right from the start where the guy gets stuck in the railway. Give me a break. And the scenes where Evelyn ""finds herself"" are very predictable and stereotypical. No, it's all too simple.

But still for staring Friend Green Tomatoes with Kathy Bates, Mary Stuart Masterson, Mary-Louise Parker, Stan Shaw & several other faces I knew; I must say that THIS movie has to overcome ""Driving Miss Daisy"" but it's still 10 stars for this movie and 10 stars for Driving Miss Daisy because Jessica Tandy was always the best actress for all time; she was always wonderful, caring, loving, and funny. Driving Miss Daisy was my favorite because Morgan Freeman Is ALSO and still is also an all time favorite actor.

92,Doctor_Phil,"A very well-written, well-filmed, stupid story",4,24 January 2017,"By most standards, FGT is an excellent film. Ninny, Idgie, and Evelyn are all interesting and endearing characters. The acting is excellent; every aspect of the production is above-average. The story is an efficient tearjerker.Dwight MacDonald wrote a pompous essay called ""Masscult and midcult"" in which he claimed mass culture was the watering-down of art until it was innocuous and inoffensive enough to be acceptable to stupid people. I detest that sort of snobbery, so it pains me to admit that FGT is a perfect example of it.Reviews of FGT say that it ""examines"" issues of racial and gender prejudice. An examination, however, would look at why people do what they do. It would reveal things. There would be some element of surprise.FGT is rather a predictable series of tropes that continually congratulates us for our own liberal social prejudices: ""White men are bad; women, blacks, and extremely poor people are good. Society is bad; rebellion against it is good.""So, if you want a movie that is to drama as Flash Gordon is to science fiction--a series of tropes for emotional manipulation and self- congratulation--go ahead and watch it; you'll probably enjoy it.

93,TheNihalGursoyOfficial,Emotionally Good- Beautifully Filmed,8,15 October 2014,"The first thing I want to stress about this movie is the incredible acting. Each actor, from the lead to the minors were just great. They fit so well to the composition and texture of the movie that whenever a new actor appeared I couldn't help myself from being awed.Apart from the acting, the way the film was captured in union with the setting was very successful. The natural beauty of southern American landscapes stood out in the movie. Each scene felt like a new experience and really made me wonder what's going to happen next. These are essential factors in the success of a movie and this movie definitely used these factors well. The only negative part about this movie could be that it is a bit too sentimental and therefore, might not be everyone's cup of tea. Other than that it is undoubtedly a success and I definitely recommend film buffs to watch it.",Fried Green Tomatoes

96,ronaldsteele-54467,Speechlessly good,10,30 June 2021,"I admit that it was ""Match Game"" that I first saw Fanny Flagg and I wouldn't have guessed that a story as complex and intriguing could come from her. First time I saw it was on a bet that if I didn't like it they would buy dinner if I did I had to pay. I ended up paying for dinner that night. The entire cast was phenomenal and the casting was over the top. Kathy Bates just keeps getting better like fine wine and gave a stellar performance not to mention Jessica Tandy. Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary Louise Parker were incredible oh heck the entire cast was stunningly perfect.I love a story in a story because you get more than one side of the character and a wider range of the plot. A friendship that lasts far beyond a lifetime. As I mentioned I didn't want to see this movie as it just didn't appeal to me but what did I know. You get everything here (the tomboy, the girly girl, the unhappy wife, the thoughtless husband, the caring old lady and everything in-between). Again this coming from Fanny Flagg was incredible, and that in itself is a story all it's own. I never would have guessed that Fanny Flagg could create such a masterful piece like this. The casting was definitely on par and seemed like the entire cast fed off each other which is rare in a movie.Everytime I watch it my eyes are glued to the TV and nothing derails my attention, it's totally up there with ""Ordinary People"" with storytelling at it's best. The director was a perfect choice and the settings were perfect even with touches of comical lines here and there.

97,RainInRivendell,Pretentious,6,15 October 2007,"To me this movie was nothing special. It is a failed dramady with an easy to follow formula and a very melodramatic plot. Did anybody seriously not see the ending coming? While people might say that the predictability might add to the movie's ""charms"", I disagree. i doubt it was intentional. The Evelyn Couch story line was utterly pointless except to give the story a reason to be told. The filmmakers tried to add humor to the Couch's situation but it failed miserably. The overload of drama made each ""twist"" less exciting than the one before. It failed to make me cry, I cry in pretty much everything, and I couldn't care less what happened to any character at the end. While Jessica Tandy was phenomenal, the only true shining performance, the rest of the cast fell flat. Most flashback movies don't work. They don't bring the story to life and it is very distracting to go from one time period to another. Very few films have ever made that work, and this is not one of them. What attempted to be a great cinematic experience simply turned into a pretentious, overrated dud.",Fried Green Tomatoes
98,jtolleson,A timeless charmer,9,6 July 2006,"EVERYTHING in this movie just works. Fannie Flagg's storytelling, the gentle southern breezes, the span of interwoven events, and the juxtapositioning of the modern-day friendship between the Bates/Tandy characters with the depression era saga of the goings on in Whistle Stop.It just gave me a whistful desire to wander the Natchez Trace, watch for lightening bugs, and visit ramshackled old towns and think about the stories they had to tell. And for those uncomfortable with the lesbian overtone of the relationship between Ruth and Idgie, it was subtle enough that you could even take the kids.Mary Stuart Masterson outshined herself... she's never again been this good. Mary Louise Parker's accent occasional rang hollow, but the two women certainly had chemistry. Kathy Bates is always a master, but particularly has good comic timing... a talent she does not show near enough.Truly a movie that I could watch a dozen more times without growing bored.",Fried Green Tomatoes

100,ttornak,Charming,7,6 February 2009,"Gentle movie that doesn't pretend to be more than it is.It's storytelling time and this time through the eyes of an optimistic, pepper old lady in a home to her younger friend going through a midlife crisis in the 80's. The movie uses this setup to interrupt the main story and inject a bit of humor.After the loss of a respectively boyfriend/brother two girls overcome their grieve and become intimate friends. From here on, the story handles topics like wife-beating and racism, friendship/love and family-life in equal measures. The plots trots along well and although it doesn't avoid drama, it never drowns itself in it. The end-result is that when almost at the end drama really hits hard, it makes a lot more impact. But even after that point, the movie seems to flow on gently.For everyone that was young in the 80/90's the actresses aren't unfamiliar and it's rather a shame they haven't been used more.Don't expect anything epic or world-shattering, however a movie that runs for 2 hours and never gets dull or too silly or needs sledgehammer plot twists, is a gem in my book.",Fried Green Tomatoes

Great performances by the four leading ladies, as well as by some of the minor characters such as Grady, Big George, and Frank Bennett, a brilliant performance by Nick Searcy.  Lots of funny moments, with the sad moments too, a very realistic film, showing that life has highs and lows, but ultimately quite a feel good film.The only thing I was left wondering, was who Jessica Tandy was in the other story.

I was also enchanted by Mary-Louise Parker, and I always always LOVE Kathy Bates. Jessica Tandy is also her usual fit self, and Cecily Tyson was great (""Shoo! I ain't scared of you!"") and I could go on for ages about all of them.I will admit that this is the Ultimate Chick Flick.  That title, however, does not detract from its overall quality.  The men are more than just caricatures, and the nostalgia and love of the book made its way into the movie.  I have to commend Avnet for his efforts.And now that I am out of intelligent things to say, THIS MOVIE ROCKS MY SOCKS! It's re-watchability and great everything make this the movie (along with Love and Basketball and my Buffy DVDs) that I take with me to college and suggest we watch at every opportunity.",Fried Green Tomatoes
106,Collaroy-Beach,A one-in-a-million-movie. Pure gold!,10,15 March 2004,"Haven't watched this movie for two or three years now and I had almost forgotten how utterly beautiful it is. But it was aired on TV last night and watching it brought back everything. You just can't help but becoming involved in the lives of Idgie, Ruth, Evelyn and Ninny! Once again I shared laughter, tears and love with them all. This was easily the 10th time I had seen it, and it never loses its charm. The score is so beautiful and hauntingly sad that it actually hurts and it works hand in hand with the terrific camera-work providing magnificent shots and pictures; the entire cast, main and supporting actors alike, are doing an awesome job (and I love them for it); and the story itself is just so great... Why ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" didn't get any Academy Award will always be beyond me- because IMO everybody's performance (on screen and behind the camera) is just perfect.It was stated that this movie is a movie only girls can relate to, and even worse, that it was a chick-flick. I honestly think this is a major insult. ""Pretty Woman"", yes, THAT's a chick-flick (which I like), but not this one. I should know because after having seen (and by chance taped) it for the first time I showed this movie to everybody who couldn't hide quickly enough (including my father, my brother and several male friends) and I swear everybody was just as captivated by ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" as I was. I'll never forget my older brother getting upset as Frank's shoving pregnant Ruth down the stairs. Nope, this definitely isn't a chick-flick. It's a beautiful warm quality movie about true friendship and how it can give you the courage to change your life and to stand up against racism, cowardice and hatred.I have thought long and hard whether I could come up with even one single thing I didn't like about ""Fried Green Tomatoes""... but frankly, there is nothing. IMO it's a gem, and I can just say: do yourself a favor and watch this movie.SPOILER AHEAD! When I first watched the movie, I didn't know what to expect, all I knew was: it's on tonight and there's nothing better on TV. After half an hour into the movie and almost until the end I was afraid the story would turn out to become a lesbian thing. Don't get me wrong- nothing against lesbians, but we've had so many romantic movies already, but there are only a handful of films about friendship and guts and strong women and even fewer of those are actually any good. Anyway, I was afraid this movie would be reduced to just another romance-thing and I was really truly relieved to see the movie ends just as well as it starts.",Fried Green Tomatoes
107,Puckdeestubenfliege,Superb visual language,9,20 April 2019,"An art lost on too many movie-audiences, this movie displays an exuberance of images and symbolism. The train, food, lake, whistle, honey, roses, bees, injuries, and more. The central theme of this movie in one word, love, while touching on almost every human dilemma and predicament imaginable. From the very obvious hatred, brutality, to the subtle lesbian love, cohesion of human life, death, trauma, alcoholism, and one more aspect of human distress I am simply amazed to find alluded on in movie of 1991, as I don't even dare to type it out here. This movie can be watched and enjoyed on any level and by everyone, but watch it more than once in your lifetime.",Fried Green Tomatoes

I found the novel too cutsey, too PC and sort of slow, but the film is none of these. It has a remarkable combination of interesting dramatic personae, a surprising plot, and charming anecdotes which will stay with you forever. The story about the ducks in the lake is my personal favorite. In short, a must for anyone who appreciates good drama.",Fried Green Tomatoes

110,Mary-Mary,Should have won Best Movie!,10,9 April 2002,"Jessica Tandy received a nomination for Best Supporting Actress (and it was nominated for a Writing award), but Fried Green Tomatoes definitely should have received Best Picture for 1991. I will never get over the fact that ""Silence of the Lambs"" won while this fantastic movie wasn't even nominated! This movie is an absolute must-see.  Be on the look out for a quote that I've used many a time since. (It probably comes from the book the movie is written from.) It is so humorously true.  Imagine it spoken by a woman with a very thick, southern drawl:""Is there anything worse than a man who's sick?""",Fried Green Tomatoes

A lesson as why you should never cross a train track. It showed him getting clear of the train, yet he still died. Guess it gave the viewers a reason to watch the next few minutes to see if he survived.
It was a compelling and engaging movie. I'm not certain if I watched it at the time, but really enjoyed the story within a story.
It had a happy ending. So few movies these days do.",Fried Green Tomatoes

113,Godfathe,Who needs a better example of human touch ?,8,12 February 2006,"Fried Green Tomatoes is an excellent movie. Performances are outstanding. The story ""smell"" the South of USA with all that spirit that emanates from Literature and Cinema from that region of our country. The human relationships, the social environment in area and time, and the friendship developed by the old woman in the care facility with the visitor ( Katty Bates ) are poetical.This is, in my opinion, a good example of a ""touching"" film.It is also remarkable how, due to circumstances, the story makes us to forgive a crime. Frank is murdered, but who can get angry for it?. There are also the "" humor"" used when the investigator celebrates so often that ""better barbecue in his life."" "" The secret is in the sauce"" Fried Green Tomatoes makes me turn more often to vegetables and less to meat.LOL",Fried Green Tomatoes
114,Ouarda,The Story Stays With You Long After the Movie Ends,10,3 July 2003,"This is one of my top five films of all time.  I was somewhat skeptical the first time I saw it because I adored the book and I knew there were some changes, but I found the essence of Fannie Flagg's fabulous novel in tact. This is a story that burrows into your heart and mind and stays there.  It is absolutely magical storytelling with a stellar cast and beautifully written characters that never fade from memory.A time and place in America, filled with the best and the worst of our life and history, is impeccably captured.  The flashbacks take us to the time of an Alabama whistle stop town that was a bustling hub when the railroad was the center of all movement.  This was the era of hobos and simple pleasures. The scenes from the past become more powerful by the juxtaposition to modern times, where the story begins and returns at intervals.Kathy Bates plays Evelyn Couch, an unhappy middle-aged housewife who stumbles on Ninny Threadgoode (the superb Jessica Tandy) one day by accident at the nursing home where she is visiting one of her husband's relatives. The two have an instant chemistry and a deep friendship begins.  Ninny proceeds to tell Evelyn the story of Idgie and Ruth, two young women who shared an amazing friendship and love 50 years earlier. 
This movie has to be experienced, as mere descriptions might sound like another southern-flavored movie about women or a weepy nostalgic tale.  It is much more than that, and more than the most glowing review can ever convey.  If you are reading this and haven't seen it, please make a point to.  The actors are nothing short of magical.  All four actresses (Jessica Tandy, Kathy Bates, Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary-Louise Parker) are at the top of their craft.I will borrow a line from Ninny Threadgoode to describe how I always feel after seeing this film.  ""I may be sitting here in this nursing home but in my mind I'm over at the Whistle Stop Cafe having a plate of Fried Green Tomatoes"".I may be sitting here finishing this comment but in my mind I'm at the Whistle Stop Cafe.  That's how powerful this story is for me.",Fried Green Tomatoes
115,moviebuf-31,"This story hooks you from the beginning, and doesn't let go.",10,20 April 2001,"I missed this film when it was released.  What a pleasant surprise to watch it and discover it is timeless.  One can enjoy it without the 'dating' that often it prevalent in movies, such as being able to instantly tell a movie is from 'the 80's', or 'the 70's'.  This is a truly enjoyable, entertaining movie; it 'hooks' you into the storyline from the beginning, and doesn't let go.  The actors are so pleasurable to watch, and are consummate professionals in their craft.  Kathy Bates adds comic relief to an otherwise dramatic story.  Chris O'Donnell has a very memorable cameo appearance. Jessica Tandy is just pure 'class.'If you are looking for a very enjoyable classic-type movie; if you enjoy themes other than action and violence, you will enjoy this movie. It is in the same vein as Field of Dreams, or currently - Blast From The Past and Frequency.  This movie will hold its own for years to come.",Fried Green Tomatoes

My faviorte scene is so funny, that it would spiol it if I told you what happened. If anyone rates this below an 8 they must have have a bad taste for the best movies! I recommed this movie to all ages, and if you ever want a laugh or need to cheer up watch this and be smiling and laughing for hours.

119,Superlove999,Huge disappointment,4,23 August 2009,"I finally saw this movie. After all the great reviews I've read/heard, I must say I'm unbelievably disappointed.First of all, I couldn't believe how one-dimensional the characters were - they seemed like plot points rather than actual people. Wild and Crazy Idgy is wild and crazy, Shy and Submissive Ruth is shy and submissive, Mean Abusive Husband is mean and abusive. The characterizations seemed to go no further than that...how am I supposed to sympathize/identify with these people when they have no depth at all? What's worse, this movie was so predictable and contrived, and I feel like I knew exactly what was going to happen as soon as each scene began. The way they kept getting that shot of the cauldron and everyone kept mentioning how good the barbecue was after Mean Abusive Husband was missing? Come ON, a post-it note could figure out what was going on. And is it wrong that I almost laughed at the cliché, tear-jerky, practically-required-by-law death toward the end? I'm not here to only complain - I must say that I found the segments with Evelyn to be very engaging, much more interesting than the flashbacks. Maybe this would have been better if it were two different movies?No, it wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but I really don't think it deserves all the rave reviews it has on this site. Plus I think I'm extra resentful of the fact that, just because I'm a woman, I'm expected to fall hook line and sinker for this kind of dull mediocrity.",Fried Green Tomatoes

It makes me love the life in Alabama, quiet and peaceful and lovely. The book tells more about the story but you can get moved by the movie as well.I definitely suggest you rent it and watch it with some girl friends on Sunny afternoon.

The screenplay is a great adaptation of the novel, the actors are terrific, Jessica Tandy and Kathy Bates in their best (what is a very high level) and Chris O'Donnell in a surprising remarkable participation. Impossible to don't get touched by this film. After 23 years it is such a good job that it still express its value as a masterpiece.

It is a perfectly made film, flawlessly acted, brilliantly written and directed. More of the actors, and the director, should have received Oscar nominations. This is a film about life and all of its elements: family, tragedy, loss, racism, physical abuse, emotional abuse, abuse of power, marriage, spirituality, but most of all the spirit of love and deep, abiding friendship that both conflicts and resonates deeply through all of the conjoined characters, their lives, and their purpose.

The writer(of the book) said that during the hard times on 1980s she start writing this book, and how much she wanted to write about the middle class American. The movie is really uplifting, there's so much to learn about, the women's desperation to save their marriage and how to handle the stress, the way people act, and the way we supposed to behave when it happened to us.

131,misskellyvalente,Brilliant sweet modern classic,9,24 January 2013,"This film was at times hysterical and at other times tugged at your heart strings. The film was based on a book. The film looked great and was well written and had wonderful actors portraying some great characters that you could really get attached to.I was a little disappointed that the film watered down the relationship of the two female characters. I realize that it would have never made it to main-stream America if the filmmakers hadn't. It was still very clear that there is a relationship in the film if you are paying attention for the simple little clues. Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary-Louise Parker did an amazing job capturing the chemistry between these two female characters. It's always amazing to watch Jessica Tandy act as she brings such heart to any character she portrays. Kathy Bates plays Evelyn and makes her so truthful and funny. The film is marketed as a feel good film and it does contain those moments, but it leans more toward drama side than the comedy side.

In fact, the entire cast was brilliant. Hollywood needs to make more of these types of films. To be honest, I've lost my love for films about 3 years ago. Haven't watched too many since and I'm 40 years old. Films today remind me of fast food - no effort was made at all in making them.

134,coolcat-3,"A pleasant concoction, albeit a little bland in portions",8,22 November 1998,"I felt nice and warm after watching the movie. There was the reassuring certainty in every reel that things will turn out alright in the end. Mary-Stuart Masterson, as the tomboy Idgie, gave an eminently likeable performance - sensitive underneath her tough-as-nails exterior, a picture of innocence. Well, inspite of all that, I came away with the feeling that the movie had lost its way somewhere in between. There were so many incidents which were not strung together - the brother's gruesome death on the rail tracks, Idgie's reclusive nature, her return to a gregarious self, and the list could go on. The characters seemed very two-dimensional. What is it that binds the two principal characters - Idgie and Ruth? I never fell into ""laughing the laughs and crying the cries"" with them. The flashback and the present could as well have been two separate films and seemed hastily slapped together to introduce two big names: Jessica Tandy and Kathy Bates. By the way, the comic element brought to the film by Kathy Bates was quite nice, only it seemed quite out-of-place in the rest of the movie. All in all, I found this movie to be a pleasant concoction of a town full of old-world sentimentality, charm and niceness, even though it may fail to tug at anyone's heartstrings or tickle anybody's ribs.",Fried Green Tomatoes

The story includes the developing relationship between the women sharing this story in their own twist of fate. It also shows the growing independence of the woman who is being told this story. She develops into a strong person in her own right. This is the female version of the loving friendship between David and Jonathan in the Bible. This kind of intimacy in friendship is not that rare among women. There is nothing to suggest a sexual relationship except in the mind of someone who is perverted in their thinking. If this was written about two men you might assume something immoral. Men are not usually as close in their relationships as women.,Fried Green Tomatoes

Some people think this movie was about two women in love, maybe it was, but the real story line is finding in someone the love that we all yearn to feel. Many have said horrible things about Idgie and Ruths love but I think its more than that, its knowing that you have found your soul mate, whether it is a same sex or opposite sex soul mate. Don't focus on something that is not really important in this movie because that is not what the director and the writers want you to focus on, its the meaning of life and how life goes on.

When I first heard of this movie many years ago, the title didn't sound that appealing and the few scenes that I saw didn't look very interesting. But what can I say? I was little then and didn't know what I was missing. My mother kept telling me how good of a movie this was, but I was just too stubborn and didn't pay attention. It was only a few months ago that I decided to watch it when it appeared on TV and boy was I surprised!!This movie is beyond anything that I have ever viewed in my entire life. Usually, this sort of movie isn't the kind that I look at, but I fell in love with the story and the characters, as well as the wonderful actresses (Kathy Bates, Jessica Tandy, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Mary-Louise Parker) who did an outstanding job portraying their characters in a unique and unforgettable way.Since I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't seen it, let me just say that it's an astounding tale of a special friendship that goes way beyond what we would call a ""regular"" one. It will make you thankful for the friends you have and even give women a sense to stand up for their own rights. All in all, I give this movie a 10 out of 10.

So much of the acting is simply apparent...nothing seems natural at all. I barely believe in any character's emotions.So, I amonly about half-way thru. MLP's character was just bleeped down the bleeps, at which point I just had to stop and say ""is this really something I needed to wait to savor?""This is definitely not good film-making...there is no film-making prowess at display here. And as for the story...well, it may be a fine framework, but neither the actors nor the anything is raising it up too much. I very much liked the opening scene, and the first 15 minutes, but since then....not for me.Very weird experience.",Fried Green Tomatoes
144,AniFan23,What binds Ruth and Idgie? . . . Love.,10,28 November 1998,"The book this movie is based on is a very difficult one to make into a cohesive movie, being that it travels back and forth in time and is told from many different points of view.  Taking that into consideration, I feel that an excellent job was done.  One of the more difficult tasks the filmmakers had to contend with was portraying the truth of Idgie's and Ruth's relationship while retaining the subtlety of the novel.  Part of the beauty of the movie for me is the fact that I knew that they were in love without anyone ever having to scream it into my face.  The four women in this movie are some of my favorite actresses and the portrayal of small town southern life is for the most part charming, but realistic in its portrayal of the racial and gender-related tensions that were present at the time. All in all, this is one of my favorite movies and is one that I can watch over and over again without getting bored.",Fried Green Tomatoes
145,IrishEMT,True Love,10,20 November 1999,"This film touched me in so many ways that I cannot begin to praise it. It is about friendship and family.  It is about knowing what true love really is, the unconditional love we all search for.  I like this film for the way I feel about myself, it helps you think about all of your relationships and why they are so important to you. And it is even a little bit of history, it shows what it was like to live in the South in the early part of this century, and since that century is now almost over, it is cool to reflect upon the beginning of it. Enjoy the movie :-) PS The food isn't bad either!!!!",Fried Green Tomatoes
146,vijayr,"Consummate story-telling, served well by superlative performances",10,22 February 1999,"Fannie Flagg's novel of immense complexity (huge cast and innumerable separate stories) could have been impossible to film. However, it is made possible, in large part, by the performances of Mary Stuart Masterson and Mary Louise Parker in what should have been billed as the lead roles. They play the two southern women who's joint story this movie revolves around. Jessica Tandy's role is to relate the story to a lost and longing Kathy Bates (in modern times). Director Jon Avnet ties the two together nicely at times, awkwardly at times, but always (except the end) without doing damage to either. He (and the production crew) bring to life a 'peaceful' southern town very nicely.The two Marys manage to convey the fullness of a complex relationship with apparent ease. There on-screen chemistry is nothing short of dazzling, and one is left wondering when and how these two actresses carved out such detailed characters without giving voice to their motivations and feelings. While it is rare that dialogue directly addresses the heart and nature of their relationship, what that is becomes clear quickly and transcends the plot of the story to become the real unifying element in this movie. That neither was recognized (in the conventional way) for their performances is unfortunate (which is an understatement).",Fried Green Tomatoes

149,meroving2000,magnetic power of love,10,19 May 2006,"I have watched FGT a lot of times. I've searched the book on which it was based. Recently I was in London, bought it. They asked me if I wanted the script for the movie, or the original book. I took the original. Read it. Well, everything was in place after I read the book. Someone here wrote: ""no one falls in love"" in the movie. Than on other place: ""and please give up with discussing on the friendship type between the 2 girls, can't you imagine just love without sex for a minute?"". Yes, I can imagine that, but it is still love, and not only friendship. And in the original book it says: Idgie had a crush on Ruth! And it says, Ruth fell in love with Idgie the minute Idgie gave her the jar with honey, and whispered in her ears: ""You're a bee charmer"", while Idgie was lying in her lap. This is not a spoiler, since you can not find this in the movie. But this is the bottom line: the two women fell in love with each other, there may never have been sex between them, but there would have been if they have lived in 80's, (like Bates' character) and not in the 30' somewhere on rural south! And that is the magnetic power, the real secret of that movie, the real secret why we love it. IT IS A LOVE STORY.",Fried Green Tomatoes
150,chunhui_shen,A Splendid and Unforgettable Movie,10,17 September 2006,"I watched the movie ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" and enjoyed it very much. The feeling of true friendship narrated in the movie impressed me so deeply. As the story unfolded, something from the movie resonated within me allowing me to lose myself very quickly and identify with several of characters, suffering their misery and enjoying their happiness, especially living Idgie's life so intimately. I believed because I grew up in the mountains, I can understand the profound simple-hearted friendship between Idgie and Ruth immensely. As Idgie repeated the story her brother had told her before at Ruth's dying, tears flowed down my cheeks.... Actually, in many ways, ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" has proved to be a touching movie.When the old lady finished telling the whole story at the end of the movie, I was brought back to the present again from the past. Then I reflected on the movie for a moment, and all of a sudden, I found it such a nostalgic and unforgettable story.For me this movie is not just about family and friendship, it is also about memories and the reflection and the flavor of time, which touched me deeply for a long time. They say bygones can't bear to be recalled to mind again. That's because bygones are in the past and unchangeable. We can't get them back in any way. Only memories is left behind. Reflection upon memories is the best gift that time offers us. If we lose some of our memories some day, then I think the relevant bygones will really be gone and completely disappear and not exist any more. I liked it very much when the old lady said ---- ""Some people will live as long as you remember them and friends, best friends are the most important thing in life.""  I also believe this to be true, and I do believe true friendship does exist in the world. It can also make people feel happy and complete if we have a forever friend for life.The movie is absolutely worth watching.I give this movie a 10 out of 10.",Fried Green Tomatoes

152,ectvox,Relationship movie,7,18 October 2006,"This movie concerns relationships between an older woman, Ninny Threadgoode and Evelyn Couch in the present and the relationship of Evelyn and her husband Ed. The story brings in the relationship of Ninny Threadgoode's cousin, Idgie and her friend Ruth from the past. It shows that Evelyn and Ed have a stable marriage but that she is not happy and feels neglected. Her husband Ed obviously really loves her, but he is so preoccupied with sports and games on television that he has been taking Evelyn for granted. She becomes obsessed with fixing their marriage and does some ridiculous things in the process. Evelyn meets Ninny Threadgoode while accompanying Ed to visit his great aunt at a nursing home. His aunt has become senile and throws things at Evelyn and so she ends up waiting outside, where she meets the older woman Ninny Threadgoode. Ninny proceeds to tell her about her long lost cousin Idgie Threadgoode and her close friend Ruth. This story entails an accidental death of Ruth's abusive husband who had come to steal her child that she had with him. Her friends helped her drive him off and when he came back later one of them accidentally kills him. This leads to a series of mishaps that culminate in Idgie and her friends being cleared. Then Ruth becomes ill with cancer and Idgie has to say goodbye to her, and she will finish raising Ruth's son alone. Evelyn was so inspired during her meetings with Ninny that she becomes empowered as a person and takes charge of her life and her marriage. Ed has finally come to realize how much Evelyn means to him and he is willing to make changes. Evelyn wants Ninny to come and live with her and Ed after she finds out her house is gone and she is alone. Ed raises objections at first, but soon realizes this is something that Evelyn needs to do and that he can't stand in her way. Evelyn finds Ninny sitting in the yard where her house used to be. She proceeds to tell Ninny just how much their relationship has meant to her. She tells her after a bit that she will be living with her and Ed. Ninny asks her what Ed thought about all this, and she says he'll learn to love it and that Ninny will be a blessing for both of them.",Fried Green Tomatoes

It makes you want to live in Whistle Stop and check out the menu at the Whistle Stop Cafe! I have the book AND the movie, and I have watched it over and over and over. No matter how many times I watch it, I still feel just as nostalgic and I get caught up in ""life in Whistle Stop"" with Idgie and Ruth. Kathy Bates does a great job playing Evelyn Couch, and no one could do better with Idgie's character than Mary Stuart Masterson. The town of Whistle Stop is so believable that you almost want to see if you can really find it on a map! Fannie Flagg does a superb job with this one, and the film is most enjoyable.

The portrayal of Eveyln by Kathryn Bates was priceless as well. Being 45 myself and having those hormonal upheavals, I appreciated her struggles as a women even more this time around.

This movie was exceptionally good. The Book was exceptionally good. In fact if you read the book and watch the movie you may actually think that these are two interpretations of the same story. Well... I did.. Kinda.. My opinion is that ""Ninny"" was not Idgie. But infact ""Ninny"" herself. I believe that Ninny placed the jar of honey and the sentimental note on Ruth's grave as a token of love from both her and Idgie. In the movie it shows that everyone loved Ruth. My favorite parts in the movie were about Ruth and Idgie... I did not particularly care for the scenes of Evelyn... gaining her womanly strength.. they were good.. but.. not as powerful as Ruth and Idgie's scenes.The book however... was Excellent. Yes, there are some hints that Idgie and Ruth were deeply in love with each other. ""Ruth and Idgies boy"" was one clue and the whole yelling scene in the book when Ruth leaves was a major tip off.... *LOL*.All in all.... 9 stars out of ten!",Fried Green Tomatoes

168,Koc12,Pretty good and enjoyable with a few small flaws!,7,12 January 2020,"The Fried Green Tomatoes is a 1991 film, which traces the relationships between homemaker and old women who move through the old stories of two girls and their life paths. Starring Kathy Bates, Mary Stuart Masterson, Mary-Louise Parker, and likable Jessica Tandy. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards in the category: Best Supporting Actress (Jessica Tandy) and Best Screenplay.My first impression after watching this movie was that it was great, but as soon as I thought about it, I concluded that there were mistakes that did not necessarily diminish his message, but the quality of the message. The film is not perfect and has left room for progress, however, due to the interesting content and the length of the story itself, which is not easy to summarize in two hours and 10 minutes without sounding at least a little recognizable and at times predictable, the film left a very good impression on me. I cannot but mention the fact that before I started watching the movie I saw somewhere that this movie was a comedy, and this movie practically could not be further from a comedy by having only one scene that acted comically and I do not say that as a criticism of the movie, the movie is a very good drama, but it is by no means comedy or anything like that.After only a few minutes of watching, on my mind was my favorite movie to ever watch Forrest Gump. Sitting on the couch and starting a story out of the blue to a completely unknown person who didn't ask for it. For a second, I was reminded of Forrest Gump and the way the story is interrupted again calls for certain similarities between the films. Particularly striking is the similarity of the enthusiasm the characters give over and over again in the story. The difference is that in this movie, the old woman (Jessica Tandy) is not talking about her life, but about someone else's life. That's where one of my criticisms of the film comes from, which is the fact that it took me a lot longer to relate to the story because it is presented far from a character being the story, I didn't get that immediate connection, nor did I get that level of emotion when the story stoped that is present in Forrest Gump. In this movie, every time I went on with the story I was fully aware that it was a story, it did not have enough power to get me into it being an action that takes place over time and not through someone else's stories. To be fair, this is almost impossible to achieve in a movie where one of the main characters tells a story and it is not necessary for the movie to be successful.It is fascinating how there are people who live their treacherous years and are happy, full of energy and feeling more alive every day, and death is already knocking on their door, while on the other hand, there are so many people who have so much in front of them, so many opportunities, chances for failure and retry, and they feel as if they will die tomorrow, and as if all their joy and happiness had long left their miserable life. Perhaps even more fascinating is how such an old person has the power to transfer that vibrancy and energy to someone who is twice younger, I doesnt have too much logic, but life can be illogical at times, maybe that's why it's so interesting.
The detail in the movie that I was most impressed with was the fact that the old woman (Jessica Tandy) does not change the life of the housewife (Kathy Bates) by telling her what to do and the story she tells is not such that she wants to live, there are elements in a story that she describes as motives for real life, but the story as such is not the direction and intention of the old woman to serve as a change in her life, it is the story in its most proper form, to be interesting, to occupy time and to extract some motivation along the way. message or symbolism such as the tomatoes themselves in a way that you must discover for yourself. Her life doesn't change because of the storyes she hears, her life changes because of the way she hears it.The scenario is interesting, but a little too repetitive and in my humble opinion unnecessarily tragic in some moments. Directed without exaggeration, there is a lot of focus on the facial expression of the characters, which is very important for this film because of its reactions to various events throughout the film. Actress Jessica Tandy thrilled me and gave one extra dimension to the weight and quality of the movie itself. Also, the rest of the cast is at a high level. The overall impression is very positive, and the biggest objections would be the exaggerated tragedy that comes with a kind of repetitiveness, and within that a certain predictability, which grows as the film progresses and how we learn about the style by which it is written. Also insufficient elaboration of the action outside the story and the time it takes to emotionally connect with the story. Despite its minor flaws, the movie largely met my expectations. I rate the movie 7/10, recommend it to anyone who loves tragic, lifelong, and family dramas, and I deeply hope that all of us will someday be old men and women with a smile on their faces, because that is the best proof that we have succeeded in life.",Fried Green Tomatoes

173,ItalianFl67,I loved this movie!!,10,29 June 2005,"Fried Green Tomatoes was one of the most inspirational movies I've ever seen. My mother had me watch it with her, and the greatest thing about this movie is how it can make you laugh and make cry in a way like you truly know the characters. In other words the way the flashbacks are put together to show the closeness of Idgie and Ruth, allows you to get to know the two characters as if you were meeting them to be your friends, along with the spectacular acting of each and every character. For example, when Ruth got drunk I laughed as if I was there with her, when Idgie gave the canned goods to the needy I felt her caring as if I knew her since we were children, and when Ruth died and Idgie was crying, I cried as if I knew Ruth as well or even better than Idgie and I could feel the closeness of Idgie and Ruth throughout the entire movie. The Evelyn character and her whole part in the movie along with her life I think brought more comedy to the drama of the ""good old days"" of Idgie and Ruth's life part of the movie. Evelyn also brought a ""breather"" for the audience so they could think about what just happened with Idgie and/or Ruth.

The book describes the relationship between Idgie and Ruth in a heartwarming and loving way. The acceptance of Ruth by Idgie's parents and other family members is remarkably described with love and delicacy of their relationship. While their relationship is definitely lesbian, even the most homophobic person on earth would enjoy the book, and could not fault Fanny Flagg in the book's handling of their love for each other, especially in that era.",Fried Green Tomatoes
179,DangerMoose,"Solid performances, not so sure about the rest...",6,15 September 2007,"I saw this movie a while ago, and thought it was enjoyable, but I had some issues with it as well. The leads did a good job, and the mood and scenery was atmospheric. Most of the characters were pretty one-dimensional though. And the really weird thing about this movie was the fate of the abusive husband, and especially Cathy Bates' reaction when hearing about it. ""Oh, you got rid of his body through cannibalism? Hahahaha! Good job!"" He was an abusive idiot, sure. But killing and eating him for it? Wow.The way I prefer to see this movie is as a macabre piece of southern Gothic thinly disguised as a feel-good chick flick.",Fried Green Tomatoes
180,judywbates,A Great Movie,9,5 February 2006,"I loved this movie, and it prompted me to visit Juliette, GA, the actual town used as the set for the filming. It's still there today, almost exactly as seen in the movie, and the Whistle Stop Cafe there has fried green tomatoes that far outshine the ones in Irondale, AL's Whistle Stop Cafe. Tours of the town take you to the spot where Frank's truck was pulled from the Ocmulgee River, to visit the grave of Buddy's arm, and to the infamous barbecue pit out back of the cafe. If you love the movie, you'll want to see the town. Each October, there's a Green Tomato Festival, and you can absolutely sense the presence of Idgie and Ruth, and Big George and his mama as you sit in the cafe and feel the rumble of the passing trains on the tracks just outside the windows. I would highly recommend you watch the film, go visit the town, then go home and watch it again to see how many places you can recognize. THere's a website for the town, www.juliettega.com.",Fried Green Tomatoes
181,servante,Fried Green Tomatoes: A Must See,10,14 September 2018,"Fried Green Tomatoes is a film with themes of love, family, friendship, the need to care for others, and women empowerment. The film is set in 1920s Alabama, which gives you a taste of the racial tension back then and shows the good-hearted nature of the main characters, Idgie Threadgoode and Ruth Jamison. The film shows the beauty of unlikely friendships that turn into family, not by blood, but by heart. Lastly the film gives us strong lead women characters and the struggle a middle-aged woman, named Evelyn Couch, has with her marriage as she is going through her midlife crisis. Through the film Evelyn finds her self-worth, with the help of a sweet old lady, and the power of being female. 
This movie will make you laugh, cry, rage, and everything in-between. By the time it's over you will be making fried green tomatoes and yelling ""Towanda!"".",Fried Green Tomatoes
182,vanessahi,Fried Green Tomatoes...warm and lovely,9,13 May 2006,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies. I just love movies that have a great plot, great actors to make the movie, and a great soundtrack to set the mood. This is just that movie. 'Fried Green Tomatoes' is a good wholesome movie for the whole family to enjoy. This movie reminds us that love and friendship goes beyond race, age, and gender, and that both are endearing qualities that can withstand the test of time. This movie will make you laugh, cry, and get up and dance too!:) The late Jessica Tandy (Cocoon, Cocoon Returns, Batteries not Included) is one of my favorite actresses. She narrates this film in such a way that it makes you feel like she's your grandmother who has you seated in her lap while reading a phenomenal story. This is one to add to your collection, or re-rent every now and then.",Fried Green Tomatoes
