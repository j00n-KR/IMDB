0,Leofwine_draca,Boring beyond belief,3,6 May 2014,"I really loved David Ayers' previous film as director, STREET KINGS, starring Keanu Reeves as a crooked cop who becomes involved with even more corruption in an gripping storyline. END OF WATCH promised more of the same, with the twist that the film is shot on hand-held cameras, found footage style. As far as I know, this is the first found footage cop film, so the results should be interesting, right?Wrong. It turns out that Ayers is a much better director than he is a writer. The film lost me early on when one of the cops tries to be a bad-ass by fist-fighting a suspect. It's not cool, just dumb. The shaky-cam direction isn't at fault here, but the writing is appallingly bad, when it even exists. Almost the entire film consists of the two moronic leads riding around in a squad car and ad-libbing their dialogue. The problem is that creativity is in short supply, meaning these guys just swear incessantly and say nothing meaningful. Tarantino this ain't.Ayers seems to have completely forgotten that films and books and plays are all about conflict. If there's no conflict, it's dull. There are flashes of danger here, and one or two set-pieces where it comes to life, but for the most part there's no conflict. The guys are having a good time. There's no overriding plot, no investigation that uncovers corruption, there's just nothing.The time stretches out and the viewer alternates between sleep-inducing boredom and frankly unbelievable situations (like when the heroes are shot at at virtually point-blank range by three machine guns and escape with barely a scratch). Gyllenhaal is awful and Pena is just as bad. I wouldn't recommend this trash to my worst enemy.",End of Watch
1,SnoopyStyle,standard L.A. street cops with good chemistry,7,31 August 2013,"Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Peña) are street-level cops making busts and causing problems for the criminals. After a couple big time busts, a Mexican cartel orders their deaths. Gabby (Natalie Martinez) is Mike's pregnant wife. Janet (Anna Kendrick) is Brian's girlfriend. This is mostly shot in shakycam style. It works quite well especially in the cop car. The two get into some good squad car conversations. The chemistry between the two couples is very good. Gyllenhaal and Peña are especially good. As a story, there isn't much new here. It's all about the relationships. Although the final shootout is slightly unbelievable.",End of Watch
2,Prismark10,A good watch,6,18 October 2014,"Writer/director David Ayer likes to show a more realistic element of urban Los Angeles. He previously wrote Training Day, SWAT and The Fast and the Furious. He has a fondness for a hard hitting take on police and criminals.End Of Watch has a POV documentary footage take as Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena are two patrol officers on the streets of South Central Los Angeles. Jake is taking footage via a concealed camera, he wants to be more than a patrol officer. He wants to be in on the action and ultimately wants to be a lawyer. Pena is a family man.Both cops are good friends and seem to be close as they are there for each other professionally and domestically. Both risk life and limb to save a family from a fire. However they seem to have gone too close to send some Mexican gangsters on edge and find out belatedly that they are marked men.The footage point of view can seem confusing and some of the shots look too much like a video game. In fact you might think they have inserted footage from a games console.Both actors are very good but the plot is rather rudimentary. You see them patrolling the streets taking on bad guys and you know once the plot kicks in that it might not turn out too well for both of them.There are no real surprises as the film lacks depth. There is too much swearing as we have gangsters using nothing but the F**K word repeatedly. One police officer too often mentions that the LAPD will not be there for you when the chips are down. Rather ominous during the conclusion of the film.",End of Watch
3,claudio_carvalho,"Excellent Film, Awful Camera Work",7,20 March 2016,"The efficient LAPD Police Officers Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Peña) are partners and best friends. Mike is married with Gabby (Natalie Martinez), who is pregnant, and Brian is having a serious love affair with Janet (Anna Kendrick). Brian has the intention of making a movie and is using a handy cam to film his daily work with his partner, under the protest of his colleague Van Hauser (David Harbour). After killing a powerful gangster in self-defense, they are transferred by Sarge (Frank Grillo) to South Central Los Angeles where there is a war between black and Mexican gangs. When Mike and Brian arrest a gangster and find a great load of drugs and people involved in human-trafficking, they are sentenced to death by the Cartel and hunted down by a Mexican gang. What will happen to them?""End of Watch"" is an excellent film, showing the story of two charismatic police officers patrolling the streets of South Central Los Angeles in their daily work and personal lives, since they are best friends. Despite the great storyline, the execution uses the annoying ""found footage"" cheap style, maybe with the intention of giving the idea of documentary using an awful camera work. The film is realistic and the conclusion is heartbreaking. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Marcados para Morrer"" (""Marked to Die"")",End of Watch
4,kosmasp,Police drama for the Social Media Generation,9,5 July 2013,"The script is so well written, it almost hurts. Almost because it is really just good! And I loved the fact, that it got recognized in America too (at the Box office, it did open at Number 1). While I won't go into the story, the casting of Jake and his partner couldn't have been better. It feels like the guys know each other their whole life. Their interactions with social media and ""real"" life feel ... well real. Nothing in this movie feels like it is staged for entertainment purposes nor does the dialogue sound fake.I did write drama, but there is also quite a bit of action in this one. The hand-held approach to some of the scenes does not take anything away from them, it actually heightens the experience most of the time. Of course as an Anna Kendrick fan, I would've loved to see more of her in the movie, but it does belong to our two ""heroes"" and what they are going through. It's nice to see a movie that keeps in touch with current events, have the courage and the quality to bring that ""cop"" experience on screen",End of Watch
5,jboothmillard,End of Watch,5,5 October 2014,"I saw a trailer and some clips for this film, so I remembered the leading actor, and the most obvious thing to remember was that it was about cops, I didn't know what to expect from this in terms of a premise or any plot, so I just hoped it would be good. Basically in the Newton Division of the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) in South Central Los Angeles are close friends and partners Officer Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal), a former Marine, and Officer Mike Zavala (Michael Peña), as part of a film project Taylor is recording police activities. Responding to a public disturbance call, Zavala fights with, beats and arrests Bloods gang member Mr. Tre (Cle Shaheed Sloan), but he is not charged for assault, later that night Tre and fellow gang members are attacked in a drive-by shooting by Sureños, one friend is killed, the next day officers respond to a noise complaint at a house full of Sureños, there is the Big Evil gang and a truck full of firearms and a large amount of money. After rescuing several children from a house fire Taylor and Zavala are awarded the Medal of Valor, and next they arrest a man in an investigated house for possessing firearms and holding victims for human trafficking, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) warn officers to lay low as the house is tied to the Sinaloa Cartel, the world's most powerful drug trafficking, money laundering, and organised crime syndicate. Taylor starts dating Janet (Up in the Air's Anna Kendrick) and Zavala's wife Gabby (Under the Dome's Natalie Martinez) gives birth to their first child, next the two police partners respond to a call from Officer Sook (Kristy Wu) and find her partner Van Hauser (Quantum of Solace's David Harbout) with a knife through his eye, they arrest the culprit savagely beating Sook, Van Hauser will not return to patrol and Sook will be leaving the force. Taylor marries Janet, and Zavala assures that he will look after her if anything happens, the next day officers find drugs, dismembered corpses and a cartel message in the house of an elderly woman, they are unaware that the gang in the earlier drive-by shooting are following them, shortly after this Janet is pregnant. Officers chase a reckless driver who ends up in the gang apartment from earlier, Taylor is shot in the chest, and Zavala is shot several times in the back, police backup kill the gangsters who refused to surrender, Taylor survives with Zavala's body shielding him, he can say few words for his partner's funeral eulogy. Also starring Ugly Betty's America Ferrera as Officer Orozco, The Grey's Frank Grillo as Sarge, Cody Horn as Officer Davis and Jaime FitzSimons as Captain Reese. This film does not really have a proper story or plot as such, the documentary style filming makes this obvious as well, shaven-headed Gyllenhaal though is reliable as usual, and Peña does well also, what works well is the relationship between the uniformed partners, it may not be to everyone's taste, but it's not a bad police drama. Worth watching!",End of Watch
6,Tweekums,On patrol with a pair of LAPD Officers,9,16 May 2020,"This film is centred on Brian Taylor and Mike Zavala; two young police officers working the often dangerous streets of South Central Los Angeles. In the opening scenes we see them chasing a car and being fired upon when they force it off the road... the criminals are shot and killed. After the investigation clears them of any wrong doing they return to work. They are soon out there again making arrests. One day they arrest a man whose car contains guns and money; follow up action leads them to some very dangerous people... members of the Sinaloa Cartel. Intertwined with their work on the streets we see them chatting together and their home lives as Brian develops a relationship and Mike's wife has a baby.The way this movie was filmed with much of the action being caught on the officer's body cameras or a camera Brian is using as part of a project gives the viewer the feeling of being caught up in the action with our two protagonists. This feeling of watching 'reality' is increased by the way many of the call outs they deal with aren't obviously related and when they are it doesn't become apparent to the viewer till Mike and Brian realise the link. The banter between the two men, who are clearly friends as well as partners, feels very natural. Because of this natural feel the moments of danger feel tenser than those in a typical action movie. Jake Gyllenhall and Michael Peña really impress in the lead roles and the supporting cast feel similarly natural in their roles. The film won't be fore everybody thanks to plenty of robust language and a couple of disturbing scenes; however if you like cop movies and are looking for something different I'd certainly recommend this.",End of Watch
7,moonspinner55,"Perils of the LAPD...kinetic, but nothing new",5,7 October 2012,"Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña are well-matched as white and Hispanic partners on the Los Angeles police force who inadvertently run afoul of a Mexican drug cartel who ""play by their own rules""; after over-stepping their boundaries, the well-intentioned cops are targeted by a Mexican gang operating under the cartel who seem to be armed with an endless supply of firearms and ammunition. Overwrought exposé of modern police business, pitched very high and yet falling back too readily on clichés, noise, and despicable language. Writer-director David Ayers comes up with a tricky visual conceit--presenting much of the action via assorted recording devices--that proves too much of a nuisance; Ayers is too concerned with showing us who is doing the recording and why, and after awhile the narrative gets cluttered up with pointless exposition. The performances are good (not great), and the seedy South Central locales are well-captured, but it's a long haul to a preconceived finish line. ** from ****",End of Watch
8,Quinoa1984,"In some ways refreshing and entertaining, but far from perfect",7,25 November 2014,"They're two cops, one white, one Mexican. Together they have a partnership that's based on mutual respect, covering each other's behind, and yet this isn't any kind of buddy ""cop"" movie, per-say. It's a little more realistic than that - this isn't to say Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena don't work together, on the contrary the movie wouldn't be as successful if it wasn't calibrated as it is. It's maybe more of a grounded tale of 'two cops', and unlike some of the filmmaker's previous work there isn't so much of the police corruption stuff here, which, after so many movies with that, is almost refreshing.For me, End of Watch has across the board fantastic acting and engaging-funny-suspenseful writing. Unfortunately this is crossbred with some of the most mind-boggling direction of the year. This is kind of movie where I'd want the script and even Gyllenhaal to get genuine award attention... and then a nice fat Razzie for the director (which is interesting since Ayer did both writing/directing duties). The found-footage element just does not work, at all. It was a noble attempt and experiment at it, and yet after the first, I don't know, ten minutes it starts to fall apart - and by the time it gets to the *criminals* filming all of their ill s***, don't get me started. The logic just isn't there for it to be done like this.The film works when it's just two cops who talk like regular guys and are best friends who have to work some of the crappiest crime out there, leading up to a bloody, horrible climax. When the material is firing on all cylinders, when the Ayer script is able to navigate between being about cops and criminals and what they got to do vs. what they need to do and the personal allegiances and the time that is put in for jokes even (or especially because) t gets tragic... It's like if Tarantino wrote a cop movie....And then you got one of those frigging hack found-footage directors to shoot the bulk of it (I know, not ALL of the film is shot that way, but enough of it is). I'll check bits and pieces out on TV at some point just for the acting though.",End of Watch
9,CinemaSerf,Lots of stereotypes angrily re-inforced.,6,13 January 2021,"Yikes, what a mess - is this based on a game? As it is, it's little better than a well-armed, foul-mouthed series of tirades that depict the worst in human nature - with or without an uniform. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña are two LA cops who seem to exist in their own, turbulent, largely lawless bubble. They drive around their streets dispensing their excruciatingly banal wisdom on relationships etc. whilst delivering what passes for law and order in a fashion that borders on the implausible from start to finish. Interestingly (apparently, at any rate) shot from an observational POV perspective, it does give us a more intimate experience as they go through their daily routine (on and off their jobs), but I found that style merely exposed us more to their violent, expletive-laden existence in a city where military grade hardware appears as prevalent as not to have been out of place in ""Blade Runner"". The action scenes are well photographed, but repetitive, dull, and not in the least interesting - even the ending, when it eventually arrived, couldn't quite decide what it wanted to be. I suspect some will advocate this as a gritty, realistic reflection of modern day urban policing - with all the concomitant racial and social tensions. Well, perhaps, but nowhere I have ever been.... or want to go!",End of Watch

11,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Up to the expected standard,8,30 November 2012,"This is a ride-along with the two cocky, young South Central LA(an area where writer/director Ayer spent some of his youth, making it out safely but fascinated with the crime-ridden place, and basing most of his movies there, whether he's penning, helming or both... and because of this, the inside perspective, they are come out as the most credible depictions of the environment, with slang, dialog, music choices and the right ""types"", people you can believe are gang-members) cops Mike(Peña, as the family-happy, traditional Latino) and Brian(Gyllenhaal, former Marine and more reserved... both of them wise-cracking(about a sixth of that falls flat), picking on each other, very brotherly relationship, and their chemistry and embodiment of these roles are compelling(every performance in this is phenomenal); and his girlfriend, Janet(Kendrick) is adorable, and they are immensely cute together, not because they're flawless as people, but because they're great together, and you come to worry that something bad is going to happen, unlike many entries in the genre, this makes you feel like anything could occur, our heroes aren't safe), as they answer various calls(numerous of which have unexpected outcomes, for all the clichés, this has many surprises... and it comes off like a loving, respectful tribute to the field of police work, this dangerous, thankless job(and to those calling it propaganda... the other pictures by this guy are about corrupt officers, so... yeah)). Essentially this is a series of vignettes, with an overall story(somewhat less memorable) hiding in the background of it all(this is highly character-driven). One day, they accidentally get involved in a cartel's business, and get a hit put on them. This is all done as POV(and it will not change your mind if you don't like that approach), since the latter of our two leads is studying the medium, and thus is shooting everything. Yeah, one of the lamer(not necessarily the worst) explanations for that. And it doesn't stick to it, as there are numerous angles that no one in the scene is getting(and ""put down the friggin' camera!"" bits). I would say that they should have just stuck to hand-held. However, it does get the benefits of the found-footage sub-genre(when it's done right!)... it's extremely immersive, you're put right there with them, and it captures a lot of private little moments that lets you connect with our protagonists in an intimate way that isn't invasive. How does this manage to show us the stock bad guys by themselves? Well, one of them, La La(Yahira Garcia, who I swear is Marilyn Manson's lesbian sister) is also filming everything(no explanation given). Yes, while there are criminals in this that are three-dimensional(and certainly every law-abider is a human being), our main villains are, and this is a word I don't use lightly about the work of David A., mainstream. The action is great, fast and tense(like the pace... the 100 minutes sans credits fly right by), with chases, shootings and fighting. It's the ""smart"" kind that we've seen in recent years, where bullets hit and punches hurt. At times it's hard to follow because of the earlier mentioned cinematography, though it's not too distracting or common an issue in this. The biggest issue with it is the third act where it abandons some realism and pushes events too far, and albeit the ending is good, this portion does take away from what came before it. There is constant strong language(in English and Spanish) including discussion of sex with some explicit descriptions and a lot of disturbing, bloody, brutal, gory, violent content in this. I recommend this to any fan of those involved in its production, and of this kind of flick. 8/10",End of Watch

Hard-hitting and absorbing cop drama with hot-shot up-and-coming LAPD patrolmen (Gyllenhaal and Pena both giving career- high turns with lived-in aplomb) who stumble upon a drug cartel with deadly results. While the cinema verite of a traveling video diary is used again to keep a daily log of what goes on during a routine day the film manages to rise-above its tired gimmick from filmmaker David Ayer by infusing the duo's credible performances and their camaraderie with their fellow peace officers without forgetting to ensure just how seriously out-of-hand things can turn on a dime's notice.",End of Watch
13,neil-476,Flawed but effective character study,7,30 November 2012,"Brian and Mike are a pair of LA cops and this film shows their work and private lives in fly-on-the-wall fashion.This rather odd film - which is, in its own way, pretty good - could have been made just as easily in conventional fashion. The carcams add an element of verite which we are familiar with from TV shows but, frankly, I think this film would have been better had the verite filming angle been dropped, and it had just been made as a conventional film.There is a prodigious amount of profanity in this film, most of it from gang members who I found almost incomprehensible (even allowing for every other word beginning with ""F""). There is moderate and frequent violence. And there are excellent performances from everyone involved, but particularly Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena as Brian and Mike, who convey the closeness of the relationship of partners: they and the rest of the cast show us, very convincingly, how the police are family, even when the family members don't necessarily get on together.This is a fairly plot-free film - it is mostly about the relationship between police partners. But, notwithstanding its flaws, it grips and convinces throughout.",End of Watch
14,ferguson-6,Til Death Us Do Part,8,24 September 2012,"Greetings again from the darkness. Hands down, this is the best cop movie in quite awhile. Not only that, it's about street cops, not flashy detectives. This is no good cop/bad cop dance. These aren't rebellious, power hungry cops run amok flashing their badges. Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Zavala (Michael Pena) are simply dedicated cops who are committed to serving the mission and surviving another day.This film works for two reasons: the performances of Gyllenhaal and Pena, and the amazing writing and directing from David Ayer. Mr. Ayer is best known as the writer of Training Day, but also wrote Dark Blue and S.W.A.T, and directed Street Kings. He grew up in south central Los Angeles, and clearly has a talent for bringing real life to the screen.Taylor and Pena are long time partners who have the familiarity and banter down to a science. These are guys who become brothers based on spending everyday together and trusting the other with their lives. These two scoff at the department mandate to write more traffic tickets, and instead find themselves smack dab in the middle of a Mexican drug cartel. That's not a good place for two street cops and they soon wind up on the wrong list of some really bad people.We see shootouts, car chases, chases on foot, rescues, traffic stops, house searches and just about anything else that these heroes are subjected to on a daily basis ... just trying to maintain some sense of civility on their beat. No matter how frustrated you get with your job, put yourself in their ""comfortable footwear"" and imagine rolling up on ""big evil"", who wants nothing more than to make you suffer.There is a really interesting thing going on with video cameras. Taylor is filming his daily activities for a class he is taking, while this group of bad guys is also seen filming their nightly activities against humanity. Also, the supporting cast doesn't play a huge role, but David Harbour, Frank Grillo, America Ferrera, Natalie Martinez and Anna Kendrick are all solid. The exception is Cody Horn who is way out of her element, and quite a distraction.Pena and Gyllenhaal are a joy to watch and strike the necessary bond required for this movie to work. We never once doubt that these guys are brothers and fully trust worthy. Good guys doing a tough job in a bad part of the world. More of this, please.

15,anaconda-40658,Watch the End.,8,24 September 2015,"End of Watch (2012): Dir: David Ayer / Cast: Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Pena, Natalie Martinez, Anna Kendrick, Cody Horn: Technically well made buddy cop film about the extent friendship will go until the sun sets to darkness. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena star as two cops who are best friends. Gyllenhaal is filming everything in documentary style, which is effective from a realism perspective, but when the villains start holding camcorders then the reality begins to fade. What criminal allows video of their crimes? Pena is married to Natalie Martinez with a child born during the film. Gyllenhaal's girlfriend is played by Anna Kendrick. We learn that Gyllenhaal was quite the hit with women until Pena sharpens his ass up regarding his current relationship. Both leads have a realistic chemistry but this whole thing of criminal acts happening every two minutes seems unrealistic. These two cops are constantly involved in traumatic events when in reality most cops may have a few of these events during their careers. Martinez and Kendrick are effective as the significant others who must brace themselves for potential tragedy. Cody Horn is also good casting as a female officer showing up with her partner to more or less verbal prank each other. The ending might have worked better had the tragedy avoided a cheat tearjerker act with a survival. David Ayer directed Street Kings so he is effective with action but this film is more effective with its theme of friendship and our duty to be on call for those who matter most during those situations that could sever ties forever. Score: 8 / 10",End of Watch
16,FlashCallahan,A steel cage with grey bars.....,8,24 November 2012,"What Ayer has done here has taking the Cop thriller sub-genre and really added something to the mix.Jake Darko (can't spell the surname, sorry) introduces the film with a wonderful monologue about life as a cop. He spends almost the entirety of the film behind a camera one way or the other, and is aided by trusty partner, Pena.As the old cliché goes, they are the best of friends, and if one gets hurt, the other would help their family, blah, blah, blah, it's the usual fodder, and this is why it isn't a ten.Luckily, Darko and Pena have amazing chemistry, and are really believable as partners, and as for the realism of the film, I couldn't possibly comment, as I am not a member of the LAPD, nor am I a gang member.But one thing for real, it sure felt real, and then some.From the upstart, the film has a brooding, almost sinister quality to it, as you know that, for some uncomfortable reason, the film isn't going to end in a happy way.Half way through the film, it really gives the game away by having a marriage and having the two main couples talk about growing old together, again another tired cliché. One of the cast may as well have worn a target.But these are only minor flaws, because the rest of the film is unflinching, and really doesn't glamorise what it's like to be an officer of the law. Silly films like Bad Boys make you think it would be cool, this will make you think different.Believe me, if you've applied to join the police, avoid this movie.Characters feel stereotyped, but somehow real, and the action is in your face, especially the final 20 minutes, which are really tense and un-nerving, like an evil twin of the last twenty of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.Darko in my opinion, has never been better, and Pena is as good as always.Female members of the cast (partners) get pushed to he side a little, but if they were not in it, and only mentioned by name, it wouldn't really ruin the narrative.It's easily the best cop drama since NARC, and one of the biggest surprises of the year.",End of Watch
17,phd_travel,"Realistic, insightful, funny, moving, unexpected and terrifying",10,25 October 2012,"I don't usually seek out cop movies but this one is unique. It is in turns realistic, insightful, funny, moving, unexpected and terrifying. The story shows a good mix of what cops handle in the area. The plot allows a good build up of tension that allows one to bond with the characters and feel for them both as heroes and victims.I don't usually like this type of natural camera work but here it gave it a sense of vulnerability of the cops going into the unknown. Almost feels like you are there with them and wanted to wretch along side them.The actors are so convincing. Jake and Michael Pena act so well that I didn't think of them in their other roles at all. Ugly Betty appears in a supporting role. Anna Kendrick is a well cast girlfriend sweet but not too glamorous.A couple of faults that aren't that serious. The excessive use of the f word actually makes it hard to understand the dialog. It's an enlightening if not flattering portrayal of South Central and the drugs violence that grips the ethnic minority communities there. Wonder if the drug crime is really as bad as portrayed. The violence shown is limited in amount and but it's hard to forget.There have been too many movies showing cops as either unrealistic action superheroes or as evil masterminds on the take. It's refreshing to have one that shows regular cops with their limits and struggles. Overall an intense and unforgettable movie - a totally gripping police drama.",End of Watch
18,gradyharp,Some days in the lives: Inside the LAPD,10,23 January 2013,"David Ayer does not shy away from raw stories. He is a facile writer and edgy director responsible for such impressive films as Harsh Times, Street Kings, Training Day, S.W.A.T., The Fast and the Furious, Dark Blue and Ten. In END OF WATCH he steps into another arena of manipulating the camera technique to emphasize not only the speed with which the LAPD must react but also the in-between moments when boredom bonds officers tightly and some hilarious buddy talk is born. What he achieves in END OF WATCH is probably the most realistic (albeit heinously gory and terrifying) footage of what cops do and how they live and survive in a series of incidents that boggle the mind.Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Peña) are cop partners who do their job in a amazingly skillful manner and at the same time demonstrate that they have formed a brotherly bond that makes us identify with them immediately: Brian learns the ins and outs of marriage from Mike who is completely committed to this wife Gabby (Natalie Martinez) and Mike encourages Brian to commit to a relationship with his current love Janet (Anna Kendrick). In the midst of all of this bonding the two officers deal with car chases, child endangerment, drug cartels, human trafficking, and a horrendous confrontation with a Mexican drug cartel gang that leads to a brutal end to the story.To capture the immediacy of both the good and bad aspects of the endangered lives of Brian and Mike the entire film is shot with hand held cameras, and surveillance cameras -a technique that director Ayers even endears his audience by having Brian be an addict to hand held cameras shooting the fun parts of their lives as well as the terrifying parts. The dialogue sounds spontaneous and is overwhelmed by expletives that in previous years would have been bleeped, but now with social media absorbing everyone's life the words are simply common language and keep the story real.Gyllenhaal again serves notice that he is one of our more gifted actors on the screen today and Michael Peña's performance is so astonishing fine that it is Oscar worthy as Supporting Actor. The other LAPD personnel given screen time include excellent portrayals by David Harbour, Frank Grillo, America Ferrera, and Cody Horn. Both Anna Kendrick and Natalie Martinez are strong as are the actors who portray the gangsters.The technique shooting this film, the dialogue, and the incessant picturing of horrendous scenes may be off putting to some, but it is good to see good cops doing what they do best - place their lives on the line to protect the citizenry. In all this is an outstanding film. Grady Harp",End of Watch
19,zetes,Awful,3,25 November 2012,"The found footage technique has wandered out of the horror genre this year and into films like Chronicle and End of Watch. Chronicle was a super hero movie and not too far removed from the horror genre. End of Watch is a cop drama, and it's a pain to watch. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena star as two Los Angeles cops who stumble upon Mexican drug cartel business, which puts them in grave danger. Most of the movie consists of the two guys sitting around in their cop car chatting and calling each other ""bro."" There's very little drama here, and, if we can judge from Cops (which is actual documentary footage), these guys don't talk anything like actual cops and are more like cliché movie or TV cops. The footage is supposedly shot by the two guys, with Gyllenhaal using it for a project in his film class, which is all ludicrous. There's also footage from the gang members who are looking to whack the cops, which is even more ludicrous (not that crime sprees haven't been taped before, but these are supposed to be serious criminals). Anna Kendrick also stars. One of the worst movies I've seen this year.",End of Watch
20,mm-39,A good movie!,7,27 September 2012,"End of Watch is another first person narrative with a cop making a film about his job aka Blair Witch style. End of Watch shows the brotherhood of police officers, the different personalities of police officers, how bad south central Los Angeles is, and the personal relationship between the two hot shot cops. The movie's strongest point is the actors. Jake does a good job as the ex Marine hot shot cop who adds humor to a tough job. The rapport with Jake's partner creates the environment for the film. The chief and police captain are believable characters, and the disgruntled cop is a great portrayal of a burnt-out man. The gang characters are dark and the drug cartel event creates a dark gloomy atmosphere for the movie. End of Watch is a mixture of dread of what will happen next mixed with humorous relief. A dark movie but watchable. End of Watch is a seven out of ten. If you get motion sickness like my wife maybe not a good movie to go to. The camera work was so shaky, it made her sick.",End of Watch
21,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: End of Watch,10,31 October 2012,"Mention David Ayer, and you'll probably remember his run of gritty crime thrillers that he either wrote, or directed, or did both, with films such as Harsh Times, Street Kings and Training Day part of his filmography. To spice things up a little bit stylistically, the found footage makes its debut for this genre, just as you're wondering how much more this technique can be pushed without boring, or irritating through its constant jerkiness. And Ayer has milked the technique gracefully here, with a little bit of a cheat of course.End of Watch may have ridden on the gimmick of found footage, where a narrative gets assembled from a camera, or multiple cameras, usually charged with extended battery life, and an invisible hand at splicing the footage together. But here's the catch - David Ayer and his editor Dody Dorn never got too hung up with whose camera we're actually peering from at any one point in time. It could be from the cops, it could be from the thugs, it could be from CCTV or video cameras mounted in patrol cars. Or it would just be. Not before long, you too will likely not care about the plausibility of certain angles, or presence of somebody else around to have taken that shot, and while this could get on the nerves of purists, I would recommend to let it be, and let the story take control instead.The narrative follows two beat cops Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Pena), thick buddies and best friends for life who take on the meanest districts in the city of Los Angeles. As part of a film course project, Brian carries with him a video camera to record his days at work, and ropes in Mike to also carry around pinhole cameras which they wear at their breast pockets. Additional footage come from the multitude of cameras strategically located in and around their patrol car, and then some. But don't get too flustered or bothered as the film wears on in determining who, or from where, a camera angle is taken from, because you'll deem it worthwhile to just focus on the story instead of the gimmick.And the story just about covers all the sexier aspects of policing, with danger at every turn, unexpected for the most parts in what may seem like a low risk, routine patrol call or response. It's episodic, and almost day in the life of, as we trace both men's personal lives, and public ones when they adorn the uniform, which as one line in the movie puts it in rather straightforward fashion, that they're police officers and everyone wants to kill them. So much for law and order, with a little black humour thrown in for good measure throughout, because I suppose in jobs like these, you need to keep your chin up, with trust being a valuable commodity whether it is earned from within the same department, or even respect gained from those on the other side.But it's all not fun and games as we patrol the streets together with Brian and Mike, since we see different facets to policing, from criminal gang violence to domesticated ones, right down to an unexplored subplot involving serial gang killings. There's a maxi-arc that runs along the entire film with the Mexican drug cartels, especially with our protagonist duo taking it upon themselves to launch some deeper investigations, or at times stumble upon something much larger than what's at face value. What's more, there's also a stinging criticism at the inefficiencies of US intelligence gathering, with the myriad of agencies and departments usually getting in one another's way, or that red tape prevents pertinent information from going through to the right parties, resulting in the unnecessary loss of lives when it could have been prevented.Their personal lives also get a little lift from the film, and it's quite brilliant how Ayer managed to weave in a romantic subplot for a film as serious and gritty as this, without losing its edge. Mike has an amazing relationship with his wife Gabby (Natalie Martinez) and their story involves the birth of his kid, while that of Brian's relationship issues deals with his meeting of what he deemed as possibly the One in Janet (Anna Kendrick). Both female roles may not be much to shout out about, but their short appearances bring about a good balance to the testosterone levels in the film, steering away from the dread in the streets toward something to look forward to, and expands the protagonists' characters a lot more in providing a different view and aspect of their lives.But what I value most about the film, is not about the police procedures, or the set action pieces which were as realistic as can get. It's about the friendship and camaraderie formed with another human being who's put in the same boat as you, with heavy reliance on one's partner to be able to be there, or back you up. It's the basic formula of a buddy cop movie done extremely right, with focus on the bond the two men share, and especially the very candid manner in which they discuss almost everything under the sun when in their patrol car. It humanizes the characters beyond their roles and uniform, and this is what makes End of Watch so engaging from start to finish. Another winner from David Ayer, and a must watch film of the year.",End of Watch
22,Mr-Fusion,Gyllenhaal and Pena sell this thing. Everything else falls apart.,4,6 March 2013,"*SPOILERS**SPOILERS**SPOILERS*Let's start with the good: 1. The rapport between Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena. Their banter scenes in the car were my favorite in the film. And Pena actually managed to steal the show from his costar. I liked him a lot. 2. There's some genuinely gripping material here with the opening car chase, the home entries, and the shootouts. Kudos to Ayer for making amateur home movie footage riveting.What bothers me about ""End of Watch"" is that it's a movie written around the novelty of found footage. So much effort was put into capturing the warzone streets (from every conceivable angle) that Ayer forgot to throw in a decent story. It's sold as a realistic tale of the brotherhood of two LAPD officers (brothers in arms), but it's not really about that. This movie is ultimately about two cowboy cops who run afoul of some evil drug lords, and they get shot up as a result. Roll credits. I have no idea what Ayer was trying to say with this movie because the sleight-of-hand he pulls at the end leaves me with a completely empty feeling. If he'd at least killed both men (not the one who didn't deserve it), we could acknowledge the nihilistic bent. But we're supposed to feel something for Gyllenhaal's unlikable character because he messed up. How was this at all about brotherhood?This would've been better if it was just about the cops' lives on the streets (and their struggle to maintain humanity at shift's end). Just leave out the Mexican cartel and their ridiculously cartoonish assassins. The narration Gyllenhaal gives during the opening car chase promises a far more interesting cop movie than what's presented here. And it's crushingly disappointing that Ayer didn't follow through on that.4/10",End of Watch
23,StevePulaski,Leaves the South Central L.A. unexploited and affecting,8,23 January 2013,"End of Watch merges an uninspired genre and a tired technique that both miraculously contribute to the reason why the film itself is worth seeing. The genre, first and foremost, is the buddy cop film, which, I believe, needs no introduction, and the technique is the unsteady camera employed by either Jake Gyllenhaal's character's hand-held camcorder or the camera found on the front of real police cruisers. Merging these two clichés in film seem like a recipe for failure, but when we realize that End of Watch doesn't capitalize off either of those things, we have a good feeling that this film is headed in a better, brighter, more aesthetically and narratively fluent direction.The story concerns Jake Gyllenhaal's Brian Taylor and Michael Peña's Miguel Zavala, two South Central Los Angeles police officers, who see more action in one day than most police officers see in their lifetime. They are the enemy of almost everyone in the area they work in, and due to their extensive rabble-rousing in the station and on the streets together, are looked down upon by the remainder of the police department. Their first call is a public disturbance one, and the two men are met with a tall, ominous figure called ""Tre,"" who instigates Zavala into fighting. He accepts and after a merciless brawl between the two men, Tre is taken in for public disturbance, not attacking a police officer. Just on that note alone, I knew this wasn't going the traditional way of cop dramas.The fact is the story is much deeper. While it focuses a lot on the day-to-day lives of the two officers, writer/director David Ayer (S.W.A.T. and Training Day) explores the outside lives of these two men. Taylor, an ex-Marine who has had a rugged and sketchy dating life, is currently dating the sweet and smiley Janet (Anna Kendrick of Pitch Perfect fame, who has silently grown up in this role), while Zavala, on the other hand, is attached to his wife Gabby (Natalie Martinez). The film explores just how deep of a relationship these men have with one another, and how their personal relationships go on to experience notable ups, unfortunate downs, and the sporadic energy and nerve-wracking uncertainty involved with being a cop in one of the roughest neighborhoods in the country.Yet as a cop drama, the film must fulfill the obligation of having some sort of added tension, which in this case is a gang involved with serious drug cartels. Part of this obligation is fulfilled by having concise insight into the gang life, while the rest is achieved by somewhat suspenseful car chases and thrillingly impressive shootouts. I tire easily from these petty additions, but in End of Watch they are used efficiently and work well to the point of being almost more than tacked-on pot boiler effects.I believe this is largely thanks to the use of the shaky cam, which contributes to the added effect of realism and suspense. Viewers and opponents of the gimmick will be happy to be informed that the film is only about 25% or 30% documentary-style, and we are, too, provided with numerous different camera angles, one of which, the under-used aerial shot of Taylor and Zavala's cruiser speeding through South Central L.A. The lasting effect is only enhanced by the fuel the humanism brings to the story, resulting in a deeper and more substantial endeavor than just your average summer action movie. By allowing the characters to have more of a human setup and the action to take on a more stylistic approach, there is a nice lack of perfunctory criminal/heist plot and an absence of repetitive serious cop banter. By having numerous little calls result in one big mission for our characters makes this far more interesting and uncertain than one big mission spread out through the course of a near two hour film.End of Watch tacks on the ending we sort of saw coming, but Ayer shies away from exploiting it unhealthily. If we feel anything, it's definitely not heavy-handed sentimentality, and if we remember anything, we recall the wonderful chemistry had by the two charming and valuable leading men. It should definitely be noted that two great performances were overlooked during this year's award season.Starring: Jake Gyllenhaal, Michael Peña, Anna Kendrick, Nadine Martinez, and America Ferrera.

24,DKosty123,Adam 12 Updated Years Later,7,24 January 2013,"In the late 1960's Jack Webb's television production company created a TV cop series known as Adam-12 where 2 LA Police partners run around LA in a cop car and chase down criminals.The format for this movie is almost the same except this version is a much darker and more adult drama. The film uses the hand held video style of shooting which became popular the last few years in other films. This creates a shaky type of realism.While the film does not do as much car chasing as the old TV series, the travel theme here is very much consistent. The 2 partners with chemistry is very much like Adam-12. The difference is in the violent crime scenes and action which goes way beyond where a TV series like that one could go in the 1960's.Whether or not you like this kind of movie depends on your taste and your ears as the R Rating is definitely earned in the language department. If you are into something to lift the spirits, this is not your film.It is dark, gritty, and a reality call in that it portrays how much more crime has become a much larger problem as Los Angeles has moved from the 1970's to today. This is not a film for the not mature viewer.The lead actors do a good job getting the viewer involved with their lives.",End of Watch
25,KineticSeoul,"Bad boys, bad boys whatcha gonna do, what you gonna do when they come for you?",8,29 September 2012,"This is a buddy cop movie but it's far from being a comedy in fact it's more of a drama. But engaging drama with two characters you grow attached to as it progresses because of the great chemistry between them. And realistic and yet entertaining dialogue between the two and other characters. Now this is a gritty and raw street movie that deals with all that nasty stuff that goes on in ghetto neighborhoods. As crazy and messed up some scenes are I wouldn't be shocked if those kinds of things happen a lot. Cop number 1 is Brian Taylor(Jake Gyllenhaal) who is the the bashful cop that doesn't seem to be taking his job seriously but always tries to get to the bottom of everything. While not being a complete jerk about it. Cop number 2 is Mike Zavala(Michael Peña) who is a good guy at heart and always tries to do the right thing and is a very loyal partner. They have this partners till we die kinda mentality. And the two are both likable cops that actually tries to protect and serve while not going on complete power trips. There is quite a bit of stereotypical jokes in this movie but it works. And the dialogue in this is what really drives the movie since it's effective while also being it being entertaining. Although this movie doesn't really have a solid plot the other great elements makes up for it. In fact it's like watching a very exciting version of ""Cops"" TV show, even some parts are shot in a found footage kinda way. To add to the realism and grittiness of it all. The bad guys in this seems a bit too incompetent but maybe it has to do with all the drugs they took and the environment they grew up in. So it actually adds to the realism. Actually their are criminals like them on the show ""Cops"" as well. I don't know how authentic this movie is to how cops deal with things but it seems like the movie compacted all the exciting parts of being a cop in one movie. David Ayer didn't do any street movies that really stood out since ""Training Day"" but this one is finally a street movie that stands out.8.2/10",End of Watch
26,Hellmant,"A respectable tribute to all police officers, highlighted by the chemistry of it's two leads!",8,3 October 2012,"'END OF WATCH': Four Stars (Out of Five) Intense and gripping buddy cop/crime drama film written and directed by David Ayer. Ayer is well known for writing multiple cop drama films including 'TRAINING DAY', 'DARK BLUE' and 'HARSH TIMES' (which he also directed). This film stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena as two LAPD officers working in South Central Los Angeles (where Ayer lived with his cousin and draws most of his inspiration for his cop films from). The two officers film most of their daily activities for an experimental film as they get in to more and more dangerous situations involving a deadly cartel. The film is pretty gritty and moving and is highlighted by the chemistry of it's two leads.The movie is presented mostly in a found-footage fake-documentary style storytelling format but also uses normal operating film cameras as well. Officers Brian Taylor (Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Pena) film each other on the job continuously, as LAPD officers, with small cameras attached to their uniforms and a camcorder they carry with them on patrol. They hope to make a film out of their activities despite upsetting fellow officers by doing so. Their daily routine busting crime in South Central continues to get deadlier and deadlier as they pursue a dangerous cartel who later marks them for death. Taylor also begins a romantic relationship with a girl named Janet (Anna Kendrick) as Zavala has his first child with his wife Gabby (Natalie Martinez).The found-footage style storytelling is getting a little old but it's never really been done in a cop movie like this, which gives it a slight 'COPS' TV show feel to it at times (but the stuff the cops get in to in this film is far more dangerous). It's really a respectable tribute to all police officers as they're never shown in any bad light. Gyllenhaal and Pena are both outstanding in the film and their chemistry is beautiful to watch, which really makes you feel for the two guys. The movie is very involving as well as entertaining and it's pretty action-packed. This is due largely to Ayer's excellent directing and screenplay. He's really proved himself now as a master of the cop drama film.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7YhqgcaX3Q",End of Watch
27,thesar-2,"End of Found Footage, I Pray",8,21 January 2013,"Admittedly, I am a COPS, that 25-year-old-TV-show, fan. For many years, like, at least, a decade, I've never missed an episode. Sadly, it looks like it's on its last leg this quarter-of-a-century season. So, it was very nice to see a feature-length, albeit fictional, version of that show in the form of End of Watch.The movie even starts off like an episode of COPS with an exciting chase scene. So, I knew I was watching a movie I would enjoy.Now, granted, the rest of the movie has almost as zero storyline as just the one original car chase scene, but it was still a fun ride watching two yapping, racially driven police partners.I would state the biggest problem with End of Watch was that, in the beginning they build up the film as a ""Found Footage"" genre flick, of which I normally despise. In fact, I only watched this for both Jake Gyllenhaal, who is an actor I very much like and has starred in a lot of my favorites, and Michael Peña, whom I've always had a crush on. (Yeah, he's still great, but damn, he's good to look at.)Within minutes, or even seconds, they kinda drop the ""Found Footage"" M.O. and it transcends into ""Documentary Style"" filmmaking. You'll know this is true with the incredibly undocumented shots that couldn't have come from the character's video cameras. It was almost as if the director/cinematographer simply gave up on that idea and went all music video shooting.At any rate, the paper-thin ""plot"" does have a reasonable, albeit really sad, conclusion – it did break me, as well as strong and believable performances and side stories aplenty.The movie felt real, it was gorgeously shot and I was very pleased to see it.And I will be seeing it again, no doubt, when COPS is finally cancelled.",End of Watch

29,Robert_duder,Attempts to show the daily life of the LAPD and is truly riveting,8,17 January 2013,"End of Watch is really a brilliant movie in many aspects. It is overwhelming to watch, disturbing and just so much to take in. In order to get the message across of what the daily street life is for an LAPD officer we are barraged with various cases and calls of varying degrees and some of it is simply really hard to watch it is so well done. Just to talk a little about what I didn't like because its a short life. When is the ""documentary"" style, ""found footage"" film making going to STOP!! I get why its being used in the movie, you want the realism but it is distracting and unrealistic and annoying. Some of the scenes begin to feel a little over-dramatic. I'm not trying to downplay the extreme situations that officers go through including in the film but watching these truly horrendous things happen to the same two officers seems excessive. There feels like there is a lot of plot holes during the film's climatic gun battle. The sheer idea that they could escape the first entry without being shot is ludicrous and really hurts the films credibility. There are a few other things in that climax but I don't want to give too much away or turn people off of the film. In addition to the shaky cam shots they often switch to this first person mode (especially during the climatic shootout) that looks absolutely hokey, like a video game. Now that aside this film will have your heart pounding, your adrenaline pumping and in shock constantly. It is a blood boiling, pulse pounding ride through law enforcement. The film is brilliantly written so that the entire first half of the film you find yourself attached to these two officers and like you're there with them and part of them.Jake Gyllenhaal gives a riveting and gritty performance. He is likable and tough as nails and just a really decent cop, though he pushes his limits under his circumstances. His partner is played by Michael Pena and is just powerful in his role. The two of them together are brilliant, just the chemistry and their scenes together are so good and so well done. It feels like a natural partnership and their chemistry makes this film that much more powerful. Supporting roles that are truly noticeable are performed by Anna Kendrick, Natalie Martinez, and Frank Grillo. The heart and soul of this movie is Gyllenhaal and Pena. They just feel real together and make you care for them and this film is incredibly emotional.Writer and director David Ayer certainly knows his way around cop movies. He's written several and directed a couple. The film is really well laid out. We have all this constant action going on, and such varying degrees of calls and yet at the same time, we are getting to know these two cops and their families and what they love and dislike and everything about them. By the time the film really gets serious, you are completely emotionally invested in them as characters and that makes it very hard to watch but in a good way. The film features one particular call that they go on that literally had one of the most disturbing things I have seen in a movie involving little kids and completely negligent parents. The film is definitely R Rated, the language is extreme and the violence as well but in this case its all understandable. This is one dark, gritty, well made film that I don't think I would rush to watch again because it was so hard to watch but because of the realism and the emotions but it was excellent and worthy of a watch. 8.5/10",End of Watch
30,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Inventive and high concept, but somehow still not quite the sum of it's parts",7,23 September 2013,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningPatrol cops Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Pena) roll the beat in crime ridden South Central Los Angeles, right as a new turf war between rival black and Hispanic gangs is about to take off. However, the heat really burns when they themselves become targeted by the Hispanics after confiscating a massive quantity of their drug product off the streets.Despite the favourable reviews, this is one I'd chosen to fore go upon it's initial release, as it would appear to be another of those 'handheld camera' style movies, in the vein of Cloverfield, and given my propensity for motion sickness it wouldn't be a good idea. But while the film is shot in a taped style through-out, it's not quite (or very rarely) in that uncontrolled, shaky fashion, so that's not such a problem. Which is just as well, as End of Watch is certainly well worth watching. That said, there are some quite big flaws and the film is not the sum of it's parts like it could have been.The idea of shooting the action with a video camera, following two cops on patrol through the nitty gritty of their day to day life, is certainly an inspired and novel one, but while it retains praise for this, somehow the on screen drama still feels quite rehearsed and you never get the impression of seeing the unpredictability of real life playing out on screen. That's not to mention the film's tendency to slide in to overblown, implausible moments where the cops behave in ways no real life policeman would, or should be expected to, behave. Most of the film revolves around the spark and chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Pena, as they cruise around from one crisis to another, and they do give off a natural, convincing aura of two masculine, heterosexual men, larking around, taking the p!ss out of each other, and ripping away at each other's racial and cultural background. If nothing else has worked, their portrayal of manly friendship and brotherhood has, and when the unexpected end rolls by, it probably would have been more emotionally shattering had both of them been killed, so as to heighten the dramatic impact.Director David Ayer, of whose five other directorial works the Keanu Reeves street thriller Street Kings probably stands out the most, delivers the same bold, brutal, no holds barred depiction of street life, with a relentless barrage of the f word throughout from both the bad guys and good guys, and an insidious, humanity crushing showcase of the lowest of the low, matched by righteous men whose only other option is to get down to their level. It's a smart and effective film, that works on far more levels than it fails, but of which sadly it can't be said works in all the ways it could have thanks to some sad flaws. ***",End of Watch
31,paul2001sw-1,Life as a video game,5,3 February 2019,"David Ayer's film 'End of Watch' follows a similar template to the television series 'Southland', following ordinary L.A. cops as they go about their jobs. But that series was excellent, both showing the craziness that the police have to deal with on a daily basis, but also showing everyday stories and interactions in a low-key, believable fashion. 'End of Watch', however, has a different tone: its protagonists are relentlessly macho, and seem to spend the majority of their time engaged in automatic weapon fights. The U.S.A. has serious problems with armed criminals (and also with trigger-happy police forces), but the casualty rate we see here is more akin to that of a video game than of real life. There are places where the drama is viscerally gripping; but the film doesn't really tell us anything about the reality of life of on the street.",End of Watch
32,bowmanblue,"Yes, it's a cop movie",7,9 June 2014,"I should probably find out more about a film before I watch it. I'm a big fan of Jake Gyllenhaal ever since Donnie Darko and watched the film on his name alone. I didn't even pay much attention to the fact that there were two armed police officers on the front cover. Then, for some reason, I seemed surprised when the film was about the police.And it is about the police. If ever there was more of a 'police movie' then I have not seen it. End of Watch follows Jake and his police partner/best friend as they go about their duties, enforcing the law in Los Angeles. The first thing you should know about it is that it's shot like a documentary, i.e. plenty of shaky, hand-held camera work. It's not supposed to BE a documentary (ala Blair Witch Project or Grave Encounters), it's just filmed like one. There's nothing wrong with filming it like this, it's just it seems a little pointless to me.End of Watch is well-acted and you'll find yourself caring about the characters. I did enjoy it, although I felt there was something missing. It could be that the story was a little weaker than it could have been. Adding to the whole 'documentary' feel, we're treated to many scenes that don't really advance the story much and seem like filler. There are only a few real scenes that link the whole 'story' together.It's not a bad movie - it's gritty, tough and pretty hard-hitting; it's just that with the obvious acting and film-making talent available, they could have kept the story a little tighter. People who really LOVE cop movies will probably think it's amazing. Anyone who doesn't like them will think it's awful. Personally, I'm in the middle. I can take or leave these 'criminal-catching' films, so I certainly didn't think I wasted nearly two hours watching it (also, don't watch it if bad language offends you!).http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",End of Watch
33,dromasca,predictable end of watch despite interesting film making,6,30 September 2017,"The fact that David Ayer is both the sole author of the script and the director of 'End of Watch' is quite interesting. If two different individuals would have written the script and directed the movie, respectively, I could have commented that the thin story written by the script writer had to be balanced by the film director, and he picked an interesting manner of filming based on some not very solid pretext in order to achieve what is an interesting movie. As the two are one - David Ayer - I am guessing that the idea about how to make this movie came first and the story was built around it. Of course, this is just a guess.Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Peña) and a couple of patrolling cops in the violent low-class districts of LA. One is a WASP, the other is Mexican. They are exemplary cops, actually too good to be true, the kind of cops that save kids from burning houses at the risk of their lives and get decorated for their deeds. They are more than friends, they are brothers, share all secrets, dance at each other's weddings and hold new born kids. They live and fight crime together and are ready to die together. And death eventually comes after them. Violent and unfair as they live in a violent and unfair world. Ours.All this is nice, but, frankly speaking, it does not make for a too interesting story. Actually what really happens on screen is not too much and it's also very predictable. I could put a rather safe bet that at the end one of the cops dies, the other survives to see his funeral, the only question is which fate each of the two will be to occur. There is actually so little action in the film that the script-writer / director added a few minutes at the end describing facts having happened previous to the ending that do not add anything to the story.With no real action to put on screen David Ayer tries to catch our attention with describing the details of the relationship between the two cops and with their colleagues, in the style made famous by 'The Wire' TV series. I like this part, which was supported by the excellent acting of Jake Gyllenhaal (one of my preferred actors) and Michael Peña . The second film directing trick is to use hand-held camera for part of the time. The pretext is the passion of one of the cops for documenting his work, which is mirrored by a similar hobby of one of the gangsters. It is this kind of technology-based detail which became obsolete one or two years after the time the film was made (2012) when any smartphone became a hand-held video camera with social networking becoming a repository and mean of communicating and transferring video files. We are left with an experiment which does not harm too much and makes the viewing of the film more interesting.At the end, I feel like 'End of Watch' despite its qualities risks to disappoint the two categories of viewers that it seems to target. Action movies fans will be disappointed by the too short and too simple cop story. Quality cop dramas fans will be disappointed because the heroes do not enjoy enough time on screen to develop their friendship and make a difference in the violent world that they deal with on daily basis. Both claims could have been solved by a more complex and interesting story and script, but 'End of Watch' did not have one.",End of Watch

I despise found-footage films but I think they found a proper way how to make one. This film has the basic premise of a police film, but it goes way deeper than that. This film builds the characters to their finest and it makes great use of the supporting cast. In short, we care about every character. This film has plenty of action, is gritty and very realistic, and effectively shows us the everyday danger these people face in order to protect us.David Ayer's film is about two cops, Brian and Mike who are partners and best friends. This film tells the story about their police adventures which leads up to the final half: that is when they find themselves in the midst of a Mexican drug cartel....and not in a good way.An incredible film like this has to have great acting. It's a shame Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena failed to receive any Oscar nominations, because each of them delivered their best performance to date. They both are very believable and nothing short of incredible. Their chemistry with each other is just amazing. The supporting cast of Anna Kendrick, Natalie Martinez, David Harbour, and Frank Grillo all bring their own persona to the film and do a great job interweaving with the plot.Overall, you'll never find a better cop movie than this. On top, this film may scream cliché, but it's not. There are many, many layers to this film and as a viewer, you just have to peel them away. This film is action-packed and I was pleased for such a gritty movie, it has some comedy to go along.

The best part of the movie and the thing that holds it all together is certainly Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña, their performances are very dedicated and it is very clear that they put some serious work in to establishing their characters. My main issue with the movie is that it uses the style of found footage to make itself appear special, but when you just look at the plot on its own, it's a very mediocre story, there's really nothing unique about it, it's a typical crime drama and the only thing unusual about it is the way it's filmed, although it is definitely one of the better found footage films out there, I still find it to be a tedious style of film making that gets boring pretty quickly. Nothing happens in the movie for a long time as well, the last twenty minutes are certainly exciting, but they don't make up for the eighty minutes where noting occurs, there's hardly any conflict and we're mostly just watching characters develop, and in fairness the movie is dedicated to its characters, but there comes a time when its audience expect action. It certainly has some good moments and terrific performances, End of Watch is worth the watch but it's not something you should go out of your way to see.

37,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews,6,24 January 2013,"End of WatchThe end of most police officers' watch is typically when they begin their bouncer gig at the local strip club.During their downtime, however, the partners in this crime-drama make movies, and start families.Brian (Jake Gyllenhaal) is an ex-Marine turned LAPD who is video documenting his and his partner Mike's (Michael Peña) beat in South Central.Off duty, Brian begins dating Janet (Anna Kendrick), while Mike and his wife work on their second child.While on patrol the pair uncover a human trafficking ring, which makes them the target of a Latino gang hired by the traffickers.A composite of found-footage from Brian's vlog and the gang-bangers personal camcorder, End of Watch is an authentic look at police duty - it's pluses and pitfalls.Unfortunately, the flip-flopping footage is confusing and the ending is kind of racist.Besides, once cops have cameras then they'll want grips and gaffers too.

38,tomgillespie2002,A mixed bag,5,4 August 2016,"David Ayer has forged a pretty decent career examining the darker corners of Los Angeles and the cops and criminals that inhabit it. While the writer/director has pained officers of the law with heavy shades of grey in the likes of Training Day (2001), Dark Blue (2002) and Street Kings (2008), End of Watch is one big salute to the boys in blue. While the partners at the centre of the story occasionally enjoy a ruckus and bend the rules when the situation calls for it, they are undoubtedly the good guys worthy of every medal going. In order to place the audience right in the firing line, the film is shot documentary-style using miniature cameras.Old friends and long-time partners Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Pena) are beat cops, patrolling the streets of South Central L.A. and answering calls for anything from domestic violence to come gruesome murders committed by the Sinaloa Cartel. For a 'project', Brian decides to record everything he and Mike experience while on patrol, fixing cameras to their bodies for a full POV perspective. Outside of the force, Brian and Mike are the best of friends, with Brian starting a relationship with the spunky Janet (Anna Kendrick) and the two double-dating with Mike and his wife. But unbeknown to them, the Cartel have placed a target on their heads after they expose a cell for human trafficking.Your opinion of End of Watch will most likely depend on your stance on the 'found footage' genre. It's been done to death, especially in the past few years, and here it feels like its employment is a gimmick designed to make it stand out from the barrage of cop movies that are churned out of every year, although it does add a sense of reality to the action. Along with Brian and Mike's mini-cams, the gang of Surenos employed by the Cartel also film each other as they talk tough about killing cops and swear a lot. Ayer also uses an extra camera on occasion, even when there are no characters there to stand behind it. It's an uneven and almost redundant tactic, that it's a wonder why Ayer didn't simply stick to the film's main hook of having the actors film each other.One of the most impressive things about End of Watch is the chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Pena. Both deliver terrific, believable performances, and their in-car banter provides most of the laughs. While their chest-puffing, overly-masculine chit-chat and behaviour does become somewhat exhausting, they are likable, down-to-earth company. It also depicts a truly terrifying Los Angeles, with the streets brimming with danger and violent thugs ready to pounce. It almost feels like some war-torn country at the other side of the world rather than the city often portrayed as exciting and glamorous in cinema. It's very much a mixed bag overall - a silly action climax betrays the gritty realism that comes before - but there are many palm-wetting moments to be admired.",End of Watch

They follow some clues but find themselves in a very difficult situation since the criminals they are facing are greater than them.I liked this movie very much because I found it very realistic and its plot was very interesting. The interpretations of both Jake Gyllenhaal who played as Brian Taylor and Michael Peña who played as Mike Zavala were simply amazing and they both did an excellent job. Regarding the direction which was made by David Ayer who is also the writer, I have to say that he presented very well the personalities of our main characters and there was also a very good evolution of them during the film.

40,Floated2,Realistic but not much point,8,14 July 2013,"End of Watch is a cop drama dealing with more of the perspective side of cops and view their daily routine as to what they do. Starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña. While you've got your disbelief suspended, you'll want to also note of the film's found footage gimmick and shaky cam, which asks us to buy that snappily-edited multi-camera scenes are. It's hard to see why director David Ayer – who wrote the similarly lurid but far superior Training Day – bothered with this presentational quirk, since it has no bearing on the plot and is pursued too half-heartedly to be remotely convincing. Presumably it's just designed to fire the adrenal glands of kids hopped up on the phoney spontaneity of scripted reality shows and army recruitment videos.Anyway, Brian and his partner, Mike (Michael Peña), ride around busting, having unimpeachable blue-collar integrity and endeavouring to clear the scum off the South Central mean streets. After a rewatch of the film, I must counter with the film is better the second time around. We are witnessed to more and I have noticed small clues that I have not noticed on the first viewing. What makes the film a success is the gritty realistic violence as well as the chemistry between the two leads. We can see why this film has become cult status and is well liked.",End of Watch
41,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Found footage's finest so far - an intense cop thriller that feels real,9,26 February 2013,"If I were to pitch you a movie about two police officers who are partners on patrol in South Central Los Angeles, one of your first inclinations might be ""not another buddy copy comedy."" While ""End of Watch"" is often funny, the newest film from ""Training Day"" writer David Ayer, is no comedy.Ayer, who spent a lot of time in South Central, takes the found footage approach to his latest film featuring the LAPD in the spirit of modern trends and perhaps the show ""Cops.""It's hard to tell if Ayer's exaggerating, but a lot of dangerous stuff happens to Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Zavala (Michael Pena) despite being beat cops. So much so that they get involved with the wrong Mexican gang, and their attempts to go above and beyond to protect and serve put them in the line of fire.Gyllenhaal and Pena have incredible chemistry as two cops who are best friends as well as partners. They epitomize the modern ""bromance"" in a number of ways, joking around, giving each other a hard time, offering love/dating advice with hyper-masculine sarcasm, etc. Ayer takes time to show these men out of their blues frequently to humanize them in a critical way. On the job, they are often cocky, proud and reckless, pushing the line of appropriate police behavior and protocol. They jump back and forth between making laudable, responsible choices and borderline police brutality.The portrait that this paints of law enforcement feels so much more authentic than we're normally treated to in cop films and police procedurals on television. They are heroes and good, honorable men, but that doesn't make them beacons of morality. No matter how much you believe in the quickly escalating plot of ""End of Watch,"" there's no disagreement to be had over the authenticity of the characters and the environment they operate in. Although we do get independent ""episodes"" in which Taylor and Zavala respond to calls and find more than they bargained for, there's a through-line involving a powerful Mexican drug cartel and the gang that enforces it. Ayer glamorizes these thugs a little bit, but it makes them formidable villains in the story. As things come to a boil, the realism of the film really unravels in favor of a more compelling, heart-pounding finale.Ayer takes certain liberties with the found footage style as well. The premise involves Taylor filming everything for a school project or something. He has a hand-held camera but also cameras positioned in the squad car, and ones that clip onto their uniforms. The gangs also carry cameras around to film their violent escapades. At times, however, we can't tell who is supposed to be holding the camera — like when Taylor starts making out with his girlfriend, Janet (Anna Kendrick). Neither is holding the camera, so that's a bit strange.Still, that filmmaking style does more good than harm to the film. Say what you will about the found footage trend, but this is an appropriate example that really works. The extra layer of realism and authenticity that the technique gives to a film really goes miles in favor of ""End of Watch."" Humor is an unexpected benefit of this film as well. Michael Pena has failed to be funny in films including ""Tower Heist"" and ""30 Minutes or Less,"" but he succeeds in territory that blends it with the dramatic in this very organic way. It would be impressive if most of the dialogue in this film, at least between him and Gyllenhaal, weren't improvised given how natural it flows. It sounds like a stretch to consider this one of the better acted films of the year, but Gyllenhaal and Pena should've been considered for awards contention. The nature of found footage detracts from what we tend to associate with/look for in an Oscar-worthy performance. We expect authenticity from found footage and only comment when it goes poorly, not when it's done exceptionally well. Having seen enough films made in the found footage style, no other two actors have done better in this genre.""End of Watch"" offers an intense look at the life of L.A.'s finest and a harrowing portrait of life in the barrios and gang-ridden parts of L.A. Although exaggerated at crucial points, it shows what can happen when officers try and step out of their clearance level. At the least, it's one of the best films found footage has given us to date.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more",End of Watch
42,Turfseer,LAPD cop saga has moments of both heady and implausible verisimilitude,6,10 May 2013,"'End of Watch' was written in six days by Writer/Director David Ayer. The story focuses on two LAPD cops, Brian Taylor (Jake Gyallanhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Peña), on patrol in their squad car in South Central Los Angeles. Taylor is shooting a film project (not sure why) and both officers wear miniature cameras on their lapels. The idea is to give the narrative a documentary feel. At other times, however, Taylor and Zavala are shot from a third party perspective—one wonders if this is supposed to be shot in a real-life documentary style (in real- time), who is supposed to be filming Taylor and Zavala, independent of Taylor's 'flim project'? Obviously filming the entire story from the two officers' perspectives, just wasn't working and Mr. Ayer was forced to adopt the more traditional third party viewpoint, for a good number of scenes.I assume that what Ayer did here was to take some of the more sensational 'inner city' real-life cop stories and condense them into a more fast-paced narrative. Hence, some of Taylor and Zavala's encounters are quite gripping. I'm thinking particularly of the scenes where they find the two children duct-taped in the closet while the parents waste away in a crack den, another scene where a whole group of human trafficking victims are found as well as the discovery of dismembered corpses, victims of a particularly vicious drug cartel.Not all of the police officers' machinations ring true. When Zavala decides to fight Tre, a Bloods gang member, and afterward refuses to charge him with assault, it's difficult to believe that a police officer, would put himself in harm's way, merely to earn a gang member's respect (the beat down could have resulted in serious injuries for Tre, along with a lawsuit—resulting in Zavala's job being placed in jeopardy).More unlikely is the idea that the drug cartel would go out of their way to target LAPD members on a number of occasions. Recall this happens twice in the film: the first time, one cop is stabbed in the eye and another one is severely beaten in the face. Then there is the film's climax, where the protagonists face the 'end of watch'. I realize that in Mexico, cops are targeted all the time by drug gangs and cartels but I have not heard that many stories about American law enforcement being directly challenged by these out of country lawbreakers. Would it really be in these cartel's best interest to directly target LAPD officers? After all, they're in a business where they don't want to call too much attention to themselves. And by assaulting and even murdering LAPD officers, that would lead to the enmity of an entire department. I realize that the cartel hire the local gang bangers to do their dirty work but such select targeting of LAPD by the cartels would result in vastly increased scrutiny as well as retaliation by law enforcement.'End of Watch' also covers the private lives of Taylor and Zavala. Most of the time, they rib one another but also display passionate displays of loyalty (particularly during the tragic climax). The ribbing gets a little tiresome as there's a little too much of it during the film. I particularly was annoyed by the little flashback that was tacked on after the funeral. Why was it necessary to serve up another scene with the partners once again busting on one another. The crudity of their jokes obviously is designed to show that they are 'ordinary' people but showing that directly following the solemnity of the funeral, diminishes their heroic stature.The 'End of Watch' climax is heart-pounding as the officers are cornered by gang member mercenaries, conscripted by the drug cartel seeking revenge. But the gang members themselves are so over the top, that we can't take them seriously. And the awkward way in which they are taken out, hardly seems realistic at all.'End of Watch' features two excellent performances by Gyallanhaal and Peña. There are also a series of fairly shocking scenes involving what LAPD officers have encountered during their travails while on the 'beat'. I didn't buy everything, particularly the idea that drug cartels would invite trouble by specifically targeting LAPD officers. Still, there's enough here to keep your interest, despite the obvious exaggerations.",End of Watch
43,billcr12,Solid Acting,8,20 April 2013,"Cop buddy movies rely mostly on the chemistry between the leads; it is what made the Lethal Weapon series work so well with Mel Gibson(before his melt down) and Danny Glover. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena are paired as young uniformed patrol officers in a high crime Los Angeles neighborhood with battling black and Latino drug dealing gangs. The story alternates from action; including the obligatory chase scene used in every cop movie; and family life with the loyal wife of one, and girlfriend of the other shown throughout. The plot is rather routine and standard but the acting makes this one of the better police dramas offered in the last few years. The camera shots are mostly hand held, with very fast paced editing, so be prepared for a roller coaster ride for an hour and forty nine minutes. A solid 8/10.",End of Watch

And if another country is close where scale of living and prices are lower, then constant waves of crime are easy to evolve. Such is a daily life the L.A. policemen should attend and act, and End of Watch gives a gifted overview of this tough and versatile life. The plot is credible, as well are the characters, splendidly performed by Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña - which is not a big surprise, as they have shown their talent repeatedly before. Filming within the movie, found footage - mostly used in documentaries and horror movies - provide an interesting angle to depict reality and gives additional thrill to viewers about what might happen next.

45,PWNYCNY,Excellent movie,10,26 September 2012,"This is an excellent movie. It has everything a movie fan needs: an exciting story, strong acting, snappy dialogue, and great cinematography. The semi-documentary format creates a feeling of authenticity which makes the movie even more intense. The main characters, two police officers who patrol a high-crime area in Los Angeles, are likable, which is a crucial element of the story. The portrayal of the gang members is also impressive. The movie is replete with scenes of graphic violence, but these scenes are relevant to the plot. There is a lot of light banter which belies the seriousness of the plot, which deals with the questions relating to the role of the police in today's society. What make this movie work is how it succeeds in making the audience feel empathy for the two police officers not as police officers but as people, so that if they come in harms way the audience will care. Patrolling a high crime area is a challenging and dangerous assignment; what it means to the people who actually do that kind of work is what this movie is about.",End of Watch
46,meeza,Don't dodge with one! Watch it!,8,19 January 2013,"The police crime-drama ""End of Watch"" is worth watching for its daring play of using a documentary-style take on the work of two fictional Los Angeles police officers, who would be Brian Taylor and Mike Zavala. Brian thinks it would be exciting to watch his and his fellow officers' work throughout the streets of L.A., so he thinks of the concept of using a digital camera to record their police work on a daily basis. His superiors are not crazy with the idea, but Brian can care less what they think. Brian is the cocky but likable police-type who has been womanizing for a long time; but eventually decides it might be time for an ""end of watch"" on the hunnies, so he decides to settle down with new girlfriend Janet. Mike is the calmer one of the two, who has been in a monogamous marriage with his high school sweetheart for some time. Brian and Mike are not only partners but also best friends. The gritty and disturbing occurrences that Brian and Mike encounter under their police watch are not for everyone to view, but it does demonstrate an authentic perspective on the harsh realities of crimes on the streets of Los Angeles, which also parallels in many big cities. David Ayer excels in commanding ""End of Watch"" with a bravado touch in both his direction and scribe of the picture. My only directorial citation against Ayer is the overuse of Brian's digital camera that sometimes disrupted the action that was taking place; but at the same time I commend him for taking that documentary-style approach in helming the movie even though at times it was not necessary. Jake Gyllenhaal was superb as Officer Brian Taylor, and that acting badge of honor could also be given to his co- star Michael Peña for his stellar performance as Officer Mike Zavala. Does Brian Taylor get pinned by gang members? Does Mike Zavala stop the balas from killing someone? You just have to make sure you go all the way to the end of ""End of Watch"" because the conclusion of this film is quite compelling. Anna Kendrick's supportive acting effort as Janet was handcuffed to some of her impressive thespian efforts she has contributed in her young career. OK, I think it is time for the End of Puns for ""End of Watch"" as I finish my review. I hope you did not cite me too much for the act of ""pun assault"" during this review. So in all, watch out for ""End of Watch""; it's worth the time. **** Good",End of Watch
47,runamokprods,"Very worth seeing, and far more interesting than most of what comes out of Hollywood",8,16 November 2016,"Interesting, moving, tense if occasionally uneven mix of very rough, hand-held visual style, improvisational feeling acting, and occasionally much more conventional plot turns. This study of two slightly gonzo, gung-ho, but basically righteous cops is alternately deeply engrossing and affecting, and occasionally frustrating. When it all works, it feels about as real as any police drama I've ever seen. When it gets in it's own way, it's annoying-- as when the camera-work becomes so self-conscious that you start thinking about it (Why do so many of the characters just happen to have cameras? Why are many of the shots from angles that could never be from a home video camera, if this is following a ""found video"" conceit?). Or when the acting occasionally stops feeling real and suddenly comes off as self-conscious improv. Or when the villains start seeming more like cartoons. Or when our heroes our in firefights that look real, but follow Hollywood rules of logic as to how they turn out. Then the film is maddening, because it's SO good when it's on target. Very worth seeing, and far more interesting than most of what comes out of Hollywood. It only grew on a 2nd viewing.

48,estebangonzalez10,Authentic and bloody buddy cop movie,9,26 November 2012,"¨If you run away I will chase you. If you fight me I will fight back. If you shoot at me I will shoot back. By law I am unable to walk away. Behind my badge is a heart like yours. I bleed, I think, I love, and yes I can be killed.¨ Before End of Watch film goers probably knew David Ayer for having written the beautiful screenplay for Training Day (memorable for Denzel Washington's performance), but now he will be remembered for his direction in this excellent cop thriller starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña. I was completely hooked with this film from the very beginning with the opening scene up to the very last shot. David Ayer had directed some other thrillers in the past (Harsh Times and Street Kings), but none as gripping as this one. End of Watch pays homage to police officers around the world. Many people have complained that this is cop propaganda, but I believe it really is a tribute to the honest and hard working officers in the police department. Many films, including Ayer's Training Day, have depicted police officers as corrupt, but End of Watch pays a special tribute to those officers who have put their lives on the line. These cops deserved a film like this, and in my opinion it is one of the best police thrillers I've seen in a long time. The screenplay was also written by David Ayer, and the movie was filmed in a documentary style as we had the main characters filming ¨home footage¨ while on duty. This may displease some viewers due to the camera movements and such, but I thought it worked well here and gave it a more realistic vibe. David Ayer knows his material and really came up with a believable script. He was helped by the excellent performance from the entire cast as well.Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Peña) are partners working for the LAPD in the dangerous streets ruled by gangs and drug cartels. They are also best friends and spend all day talking about their families and such in between chases and gun shootings while they patrol the streets. Mike is married to Gabby (Natalie Martinez) who is expecting their first child, while Brian has begun dating a very intelligent girl named Janet (Anna Kendrick) with whom he's falling for. As the two men discuss their daily lives and play jokes on other officers they also get the job done. They are so good at what they do that a dangerous drug cartel marks them for death after they confiscated some of their money and firearms. Brian and Mike continue with their lives as usual while saving children from a burning house and fighting criminals in the street without feeling like heroes. Frank Grillo plays the Sarge, and America Ferrera and David Harbour two other officers in the department.The chemistry between Michael Peña and Jake Gyllenhaal in this film is what really makes this film stand out from the rest. We've seen many similar films dealing with these issues, but none feel as real as this movie did. Thanks to the performance from the cast and the well written screenplay the movie feels authentic. Peña and Gyllenhaal could even receive nominations for their performance. That is how good they are here. Anna Kendrick is such a talented actress, I don't think she gets the recognition she deserves. She is great here in her supporting role and is always a delight to watch on screen. The performance from each of the members of the gang was also incredible, this is as real and authentic as they've ever been depicted. The film combines great action scenes with a lot of laughs and dramatic moments; it is a very emotional ride and director David Ayer does a great job at managing this. I will be on the lookout for his next film because I was really impressed with his work here. Definitely one of the top ten films of the year: It is authentic and bloody.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",End of Watch

51,TdSmth5,Great action movie,8,12 October 2012,"Finally, the lost footage format- painfully overdone in horror- makes it to a genre better suited- action movies. In End of Watch, one LAPD officer, Brian, as expected decides to film everything. Fortunately, this movie is more of a hybrid giving us both POV and 3rd person perspective. But we aren't spared the ridiculous green nightvision.Brain and his partner Mike patrol the most dangerous area of South Central. Even though they are and look young, they act as if they were seasoned veterans. We go with them on some lame calls and some more exciting ones that get them commendations and awards. At some point they start running into strange drug cowboys whose crimes go uninvestigated. Brain then decides to go visit a house of one of these characters and discovers a human smuggling ring combined with gruesome murders, mutilations, narco saints. Some federal force intervenes and tells them to go mind their own business. But the discovery gets them also greenlit.In the meantime, we go along with these guys as they kid around in the car and talk about all things hispanic and white. Brain meets a girl and gets married, Mike's wife has a baby. And eventually the job put out on them is realized.The characters are likable although I think that both Brian and Mike are miscast. Both of them look too young and small, although it's probably true that the LAPD will hire anybody, to fulfill their quotas and whatnot. It takes about an hour to get used to Gyllenhaal's weird face which of course takes up most of the screen time. End of Watch is very realistic in dialog and capturing the personalities of LA cops. But the friendship of these two is a bit overdone and idealized. At no point do they disagree. It's because of the realism of the script that this movie doesn't shy away from stereotypes, but presents them as they are and uses them for the sake of humor. The hispanic guy has a huge family, married his wife at age 18, but somehow took his time in getting her pregnant. The white guy has no family to speak of, sleeps around, and looks for a soulmate. The traits of each are delightfully ridiculed by the other.End of Watch doesn't really take us to new terrain. It's like watching 4 episodes of The Shield, and that is high compliment, but without the corruption and intrigue but with POV. Sometimes it makes too much of the life of our guys. Brain's wedding takes forever. Even though this movie is pretty exciting, you do feel its 2 hour running time. The action is very thrilling but there's not enough of it. It should really have focused more on the narco aspect and introduced us to some more cops. Overall this movie will probably change the way action movies are filmed. But at this point, I don't think it's necessary anymore to make the camera a character. If you go with that format it's fine just to go with it and give no explanations. It's more trouble to explain why anyone would suddenly decide to film everything no matter what, than just leave it alone.",End of Watch
52,aidanratesmovies,A Smart Success,10,2 February 2020,"An incredibly in depth, smart, and stunning cop film that surpasses all the rest; End of Watch breathes a new kind of life into a dying genre, and does it with flair to spare. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña make for some great chemistry and great performances. David Ayer proves himself to be a force to admire as well, behind the camera and on paper. His successes may not go much past this film, considering his critical failures of Suicide Squad and Bright, but the film proves that there's plenty of talent throughout him if put in the right energy, and this film clearly has what the others did not. The documentary film style makes for some interesting and by far entertaining situations, that make the film feel more personal and real than any of its kind. The film is full of compassion, humor, heart, and tragedy, and is somehow balanced perfectly in the hands of Ayer. In the end, End of Watch is a film not to be missed by fans of the cop genre and film lovers in general.

This is a fair question as one isn't really sure if this is a Blair Witch ala cop story rip-off or a pseudo-documentary. If true representations of rough language, jerky cam-corder visuals, and ""in-the-gutter"" vignettes of life around societies edges doesn't cause you to retreat then you will be rewarded with a truly unique police drama IF YOU JUST PERSERVERE.The very irritating hand-held cam visuals serve their purpose in due time.

You will see that they are completely human with all of the traits you and I hope we possess, but they are dropped into a living hell to do their 9-to-whatever daily in which they really do make a difference.This is one heart-wrenching depiction of life as it can be for those who protect and serve. The fact that the two partners portrayed couldn't be more different yet are united by their desire to do their job is absolutely brilliantly built with their daily routines combined with just the minimal insights into their personal lives (that is to say their back and current stories are compact and powerful, never boring).I think this is a very polarizing movie. Their are some who will be profoundly moved by it and those who can't sit through it. I am one of the first. I think this is a movie that matters. It shows sacrifice and dedication that, while it's a movie, rings true on most of the levels that mirror what is happening in the cruelest of all situations faced. It isn't in any way a ""me-too"" police drama as it carves its own landscape as to what some of the roughest streets really are like. One reviewer said it is scarier than any horror movie he's seen. I couldn't agree more...except unlike most all horror films I've ever seen this movie actually matters. Highly recommended.",End of Watch

56,dalydj-918-255175,End of Watch is the that Southland movie,8,1 November 2012,"""End of Watch is a cop movie that suffers most from it's use of found footage because it does not really work at times."" 11 years ago when David Ayer wrote the academy award winning film Training Day, he now directs his own written cop drama. The story is simply about the day to day job of these two cop friends. They travel in their car daily talking about life until they crime hits and they got to get involved. These two cops while arresting people and going through life always seem to have a camera somewhere to watch all the drama. The film is not just about the police department because it also deals with these two men in personal life as they get married, party and have babies.The use of found footage in this film was an idea of Ayer and I like his decision to use this however after watching how it turned out I do not think it really works for this story. The found footage is brought up a lot in the conversation of all the characters and that is not really what I liked about the film. The relationship between these two seems very loving as they laugh and talk in the car. The ending of this film is where the big dramatic shootout that happens in all cop films happens and the results of that shootout did not really satisfy me.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Brian Taylor who out of the two is the most out of control. Gyllenhaal gives a fine performance because he is funny in his line delivery but he is able to give the drama he needs to the script. Michael Peña plays his partner Mike Zavala the more stable one. Peña for me was better then Gyllenhaal because he gets the more emotional part especially near the end of the film with the events that occur to him and how they effect him. Anna Kendrick and Natalie Martinez play the wives of these men and a police wife always has to fear that her husband may not come back alive. They are good with Kendrick being the better just because she really is showing that with a role as small as these she can make a great impression.The film overall is strong which is due to the chemistry that Gyllenhaal and Peña share, they bring these characters to live which made some of my favourite scenes that happened in the car between the two. The film was funny when it needed to but at the end I felt the drama with the way Ayer decided to end the film.MOVIE GRADE: B (MVP: Michael Peña)",End of Watch
57,TheOneThatYouWanted,Overrated Garbage? Nearly.,4,24 June 2016,"So I finally watched this movie. It has been on my to watch list for literally years now. And I am speechless. Just speechless. And not speechless in the good kind of way, as you have probably guess by my title and ranking for the film. While watching the film I was only thinking two things. First, whoever wrote the script is an idiot. Second, Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena save this movie. Everything about the movie expect the acting is awful. There is so much wrong with the film that I don't even know where to begin. I mean, it is just one of those movies where there is so much wrong with the script that it isn't even funny. It is a story about two cops in LA and that's pretty much it. But the problem is all the stupid little things that take you out of the film. For example, the main police officer is filming everything for whatever stupid law school reason or whatever and then they explain why they're wearing body cameras and I'm like okay, that is just a lazy way of justifying why this film is going to be shot in a first person perspective. But then the stupid film isn't even shot like that! And to make things better, all the stupid gang members have cameras and are filming everything! WHAT THE HELL? There is literally no reason why you would need that to happen because the film doesn't need them to be filming because it isn't even a first person perspective film anymore! It was like that director didn't know what the hell he was going to do with the film and it just comes off as a joke. I was going to give the film a 5 out of 10 stars but I'm going to knock off an extra star because of how stupid that whole camera business is. And then there is the idiotic script. A cop gets into a fight with a gang member for no reason and the gang member doesn't report him? Honor and bullshot isn't a real thing when it comes to gang culture. I know Hollywood loves to glorify gangbanging cowards because of whatever but that part of the script just screams of stupidity. Next, the gang consisting of 2 guys and 2 girls or whatever. Right. Yeah, right. There are girl gangs and there are guy gangs but a mixed sex gang is purely there for the novel angle. I know, I know, girls can do what guys can do but just go and watch a few documentaries about gangs from LA if you don't believe me. Oh, and just because a police office on the street is a strong female then that makes her a lesbian by default? Man, this script just pisses me off. It was like this cr#ppy screenplay was written by a clown surfing wikipedia for a day or two. Yeah, the script is the biggest problem. The directing is the next biggest issue. Thankfully the lead actors are great actors. If it wasn't for them I would have stopped watching after a few minutes. I have no idea why this movie is even ranking a 7. Are people ignoring all the logic problems with the film or just idiots into gangland action flicks? At the end the main cops are killing their way out and not grabbing the automatic weapons? Or not jacking the car of the guy they just killed? Just so many logic gaps like that are what take you out of the movie... unless you're just watching the film to get off on the action. Whatever. There is a reason why Transformers movies make as much money as they do.",End of Watch
58,Seraphion,Nice story flow and mood control topped with a dramatic ending,7,24 December 2014,"I really like how the story takes the viewers through the mood increase and decrease alternately. It does this not by restarting the action buildup, but by inserting scenes and sequences of the family matters of each main character. The crime buildup feels quite shocking to see, but it feels like a probability seeing that the movie takes place in South Central. The sub plots with the families, the extra stretch with the others cops and the inserts about the gang members nicely complete the story. The movie's ending comes quite unexpectedly as a very quick escalation. And it ends with a very dramatic ending, complete with the nice twist at the epilogue. The acting side sees nice balancing done by Michael Pena alongside the experienced Jake Gyllenhaal in acting out the two main characters. Here Pena can complete the scenes well even though it seems that Zavala fell out of the spotlight at times.",End of Watch
59,p-stepien,Whatcha gonna do???,8,29 December 2012,"The ""Cops"" television series, following real life exploits by police officers, meets the found footage genre, to deliver something that seemed so obvious: a realistic cop thriller filmed as if a documentary. Utilizing hand-held cameras, not only by cops, but also gangsters in the district, creates a well-molded gripping tale of everyday life of a LA police unit. Centered around intellectual turned cop Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and the more standard Hispanic persona of Mike ""Z"" Zavala (Michael Peña), audiences are brought out into the chaos of LA to experience up close the problems, fears, frailties and misgivings of patrolling the streets. As Taylor is currently taking a filmmaking course he decides to take his camera with him to record an experimental project about police work. Thus filming the majority of what transpires within several weeks of work...A movie not focused on heroic super-cops, but your average boys in blue with a sense of purpose, full with weaknesses and doubts, but still with enough courage and commitment to make tough decisions to uphold the law. Knowing the neighbourhood and distancing themselves from absurdities within the system, they have to work with the environment, not against it. Thus they occasionally turn a blind eye to minor crimes or issues like marijuana use, but never once is the moral integrity of Taylor and Zavala in doubt. This is the undeniable strength of the movie: delivering two extremely likely and likable characters, which show a full range of human emotionality, not one limited by ""Die Hard"" conventionality. When the cops are not intervening the film is littered with what happens in between action, the mundanity of waiting, driving, talking, filling in reports... Shown as part of society, not as detached individuals which function as alien elements, they help explain the psychological needs of the line of work, together with the everyday fear and emotional tension brought about by the lingering closeness of death. Within this there is time for emotionality, laughter, contemplation. Thankfully all played out in an extremely real manner, often seeming naturally unscripted, hardly ever dropping a false note as the two main characters interact with each other and society at large.Albeit far from perfect, especially in the final fifteen minutes, which drop down several notes in terms of acting (albeit not by the main cast, but mostly be secondary characters) and story coherence, ""End of Watch"" is an excellent police flick, rife with societal commentary and an intriguing look into the extraordinary normalcy of law enforcement. Thus, in some regards, it will probably settle down to become required viewing for anyone interested in the subject. Definitely one of the most inventive and enticing action movies of the year, despite having nowhere near the same amount of explosions as its competition. The story itself may seem chaotic and purposeless at times, jumping around and introducing seemingly random subplots. But then again this is supposed to mimic real life, not a well penned script leading the story from A to Z. The formation of characters is pivotal, and each of these tidbits of side knowledge help build the bigger picture. The biggest flaw seems to be with secondary characters, which tend to be poorly scripted stereotypes, instead of real life people. Still, despite this slightly detrimental issue, ""End of Watch"" is an insightful and powerful police movie made by a genre regular David Ayer. Well worth the attention and praise it has been getting.",End of Watch

61,bob-rutzel-1,The Banter/Chemistry save this,7,25 January 2013,"We follow two LAPD cops, Brian (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike (Michael Pena) on patrol in a sector they are new to. Brian video-tapes all actions. I was under the impression that this was documentary and therefore had no interest in it. But, I was told that this was not the case. However, with Brian video-taping everything and the nervous camera always there throughout the movie, it did have that documentary feel at times.What makes this work is the banter and chemistry between Brian and Mike - partners and friends. The dialogues, ribbing, ragging throughout kept me watching. It was very good, funny at times, unlike the forced, not funny banter between the McGarrett and Dano characters on the new Hawaii 5-0 TV show (don't hold back, tell us how you really feel).The rest of the movie shows us nothing new, but these are dangerous times and I am not belittling the encounters the police experience. To cite just a few things we see them: save children in a burning house; save children hidden and duct-taped in a house for a reason I wasn't able to hear; run across a house loaded with cocaine and dead bodies and one house used for human trafficking with people so enslaved. We also see some of their personal lives, horse-play, dating, marrying and so on. Basically, nothing new and if you like this type of police work, watch SOUTHLAND TV show when it comes back. It is excellent. Yes, we do see things that most police officers on patrol won't see in their lifetimes, but the idea is to show us these things do happen often and we really are living in dangerous times. We get it. I hope we get it. This is well acted all around. There is no CGI, just good ordinary stunts. Everything we see leads us to the End of Watch. (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: yes.

64,rivertam26,Cinematic hyper realism,8,22 September 2012,"Set on the streets of South central two police officers/best friends find themselves targeted by a group of vicious criminals. That's the basic synopsis of what the film is about but is by no means as generic as it sounds. Combining a police drama with a found footage angle works fantastically as the film ratchets a sometimes overwhelming barrage of suspense while keeping it grounded in a cinematic hyper realism. The scenes in which they interact with their girlfriends, wives and other officers are what works best. Making the whole production feel compelling and fresh. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena have an unfounded bro chemistry rarely seen on screens. it feels so real and not the least bit scripted. They don't fall into any specific character stereotypes and aren't completely likable either they are well developed characters with mannerisms and imperfections rarely touched upon and captured. Sadly the only thing that bogs down the proceedings are the addition of vacuous, generic street thugs that have way too much screen time as the films villains. But bolstering with strong performances from the two leads and a great supporting cast which includes Cody Horn, America Ferrera, Joel Edgerton and the really likable Anna Kendrick End of watch is an original, action drama with a frantic kinetic energy that lends itself to the films overall compelling effect.

65,Screen_Blitz,Gritty police drama with a surprisingly powerful edge,8,23 February 2016,"Director David Ayer has come up with some decent films in the past, Training Day in particular which is wrote. Here, Ayer gives an unexpectedly powerful execution to this found-footage police drama placing Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena in the two lead roles. With the mix of documentary-style filmmaking, a thoughtful script and direction, this police drama pulls viewers into an unique experience that utterly defies expectations of what filmmakers can do with the found footage genre. This film follows Los Angeles police officers Brian Taylor (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) and Miguel Zavala (played by Michael Pena) on their day-to-day work with the LAPD in the crime-flooded city of South Central Los Angeles where drug dealing runs high and homicide is rampant. The film also touches greatly on their personal relationships and their encounters notorious gangs. Taylor is former U.S Marine living his fiancée Janet (played by Anna Kendrick), and Zavala lives at home with his wife Gabriella (played by Natalie Martinez) who is pregnant. This film partially takes place through the perspective of Taylor's camcorder which he uses to document their police activities.David Ayer without a doubt gives this cop drama the proper, if flawed execution it deserves, and manages to make the found footage style work decently. From the opening scene of the violent car chase filmed through the hood-view camera of the police car, to the vicious fist fights and apprehensions of fleeing criminals, to an intense scene taking place in a house roaring in flames; this film steers away from the typical shaky cam nonsense and treat audiences with an authentic look at cops during their hours on the line of duty, and sweeping crime off the street. Though the documentary style does tend to make some scenes more procedural than plot-based, it conveys a palpable atmosphere to where audiences can almost feel the tension of action that goes on. There are some shootouts, car chases, bloody imagery and other fierce situations that put the characters' live in peril. The stakes are set high, particularly the final fifteen minutes, and the script does not sugercoat nor exaggerate the depiction of police officers' active duty. Along with these somber bits is of course, there some few laughs squeezed out in some light-hearted moments such as the hilarious conversations between the two lead characters. Actors Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena show some amazing chemistry on screen and their performances bring out the best of the film, especially as the two went through an intensive training program including ride-alongs to prepare their roles.End of Watch is one of the best police films Hollywood has to offer, and quite an unique experience that serves a powerful edge. This film pays a great tribute to the law enforcement and the police officers who are out there putting their lives on the line to protect their local citizens. Yes, it is gritty and very violent in some places, but it also very honest on what goes on with officers of the Los Angeles Police Department.",End of Watch
66,Troy_Campbell,Frustrating crime flick,4,8 November 2012,"Shot in a quasi-documentary style with the (unsuccessful) aim of increasing the gritty realism the film relies upon for gravitas, writer-director David Ayer instead should've put more effort into crafting a story that doesn't depend on genre clichés and character stereotypes so frequently. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena share a naturalistic chemistry as the brothers in blue – their abuse-slinging conversations whilst patrolling the streets are often both funny and touching – however they are constantly fighting an uphill battle against cartoonish criminals, outlandish plot contrivances and Ayer's occasionally over-the-top dialogue. And for the love of cinematic common sense, I wish filmmakers would treat baddies brandishing AK47s with more respect; they aren't that bad at hitting a target 20 metres away, especially when there are four of them. A frustrating crime pic that never reaches its potential.",End of Watch

68,seymourblack-1,"""Behind My Badge Is A Heart Like Yours""",9,10 July 2018,"Instead of relying on an orthodox plot-driven piece to illustrate just how challenging it is to police South Central Los Angeles, this crime drama focuses on the work of a couple of young, honest LAPD officers who're routinely thrown into situations that are extremely dangerous, unpredictable and potentially life-threatening. The cops in question are Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Miguel ""Mike"" Zavala (Michael Pena) who firmly believe that they ""get involved in more capers in one deployment period than most cops see in their entire careers"".In their work, the threat of violence is ever-present with even the most routine-sounding call-outs (e.g. a noise complaint or a missing person report) providing no room for complacency and events like a car chase almost inevitably ending in a shootout. Another type of danger they encounter is seen when they arrive at the scene of a well advanced house fire with no fire fighters in attendance and kids trapped inside the building. The extreme bravery that they display in going into the house and successfully rescuing the children is then fully recognised when they're both awarded the prestigious ""Medal of Valor"". Not all their endeavours, however, lead to such positive outcomes and when they unwittingly start to disrupt the activities of a ruthless Mexican drug cartel who are in the process of spreading their influence into South Central; contract killers are quickly hired to eliminate them.Taylor and Zavala's professional partnership and personal friendship were both well established long before they're first seen on-screen and their interactions clearly display how unshakably loyal they are to each other and how readily they would trust each other with their lives. As well as sharing a great deal of banter, they also discuss their personal lives and challenge each other's views on how they conduct their relationships. Taylor who's had a large number of short-term relationships has recently met Janet (Anna Kendrick) and Zavala is happily married to Gabby (Natalie Martinez) who's pregnant with their first child.Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena are both outstanding in their roles which provide a marvellous insight into the type of people who put their lives on the line every time they go out to work. Whilst the dangers they confront provide the movie with most of its tension, there are also many lighter moments which show another side of their personalities and Brian and Janet's moves when they dance along to ""Push It"" by Salt 'N' Pepa are a lot of fun to watch. Taylor delivers the movie's opening narration which includes the line "" behind my badge is a heart like yours"" and Gyllenhaal and Pena's performances leave no doubt that this is indeed true of the courageous tough guys that they play.""End of Watch"" is gritty, action-packed and presented in documentary-style with the events on-screen being seen from multiple viewpoints by courtesy of a whole variety of different cameras (e.g. a police dash cam, a camcorder carried by Taylor and cameras attached to the cops' uniforms ). This treatment is highly effective in enhancing the immediacy, edginess and excitement of what's seen during the episodic accounts of the cops' activities and the movie's excellent soundtrack also complements its style perfectly with Public Enemy's ""Harder Than You Think"" providing a real high point. Most people will be pleasantly surprised to find how engaged they become with Taylor and Zavala as characters and how much more substance, poignancy and humanity is seen here, compared to most cop movies.",End of Watch

'What the film lacks in term of plot development it more than makes up for in entertainment value, with some intense action scenes, genuinely funny moments and a great script.Part of the reason the ending is so hard-hitting is because it's easy for the audience to build a connection with the two officers.

They make some lucky and high-profile arrests and get some notoriety. They also attract the attention of a Mexican drug kingpin.There are some great arrests, as well as significant arrests foiled by federal agencies, plus loss of colleagues. Taylor's wedding to Janet was quite a talk fest, but was reasonably written and acted. The rotten camera work, throughout, just put a damper on everything.They find more horrible things during routine investigations. They learn from an informant that there is a paid hit out with their names on it.The Mexican gang lures them into a trap and attacks with heavy weaponry. They get a message out calling for backup, which seems dreadfully slow in coming. Taylor takes one in the hand and later one in the chest. While Zavala tries to revive Taylor, he is surrounded by gang members who unload dozens of rounds into him.Backup arrives and a fire fight immediately ensues. The assassins are mostly killed. There is a huge police event afterward for Zavalos, whose body shielded Taylor.The last segment, shown after Taylor struggles to say what he feels at Zavala's ceremony, was perhaps the best segment of the film. This was not so much for the content of their conversation, but for the evident bond between brothers-in-arms.-----Scores------Cinematography: 0/10 The film used button cams, security footage, and various hand-held cameras to give a deeply incompetent presentation.Sound: 8/10 Fairly good considering the video.Acting: 6/10 Who can tell what the actors are doing when the cameras are out of control?

71,Joxerlives,Best buddy cop movie since Colors!,8,28 September 2014,"Still not as good as 'Heat' but that's not a buddy movie (in fact it's more or less an adversarial film). Lot's of very good stuff here, we have one of the most accurate and honest depictions of everyday police culture that we shall ever see, the conversations between the various characters are totally believable and naturalistic and if they sometimes stray close to cliché that's only because the stuff men talk about between one another at work tend to be clichéd, they're blue collar working guys rather than philosophers. They both come across as extremely tough men but likable and professional (as opposed to Woody Harrelson's LAPD bashing in 'Rampart'). Their wives/girlfriends are refreshingly true to life, perhaps starting off as 'Badge Bunnies' but then becoming real people and you feel for their loss. Their superiors are well portrayed too, neither pen pushers out to further their own careers or just one of the boys, falling somewhere in between. The 'other team'(as Simon Pegg would put it) of Hauser and the 'Boot' are well rounded and even though you barely get to know them the sight of her beaten and him surviving a knife in the eye is still extremely shocking. Interesting to contrast this with Colors which was essentially a gang movie to now the creeping infiltration of Mexican organised crime into American society. One thing I did wonder about was 'Xena and Gabby', the female 'partners'(?) on their shift, was there supposed to be some sort of history between Xena and the foul mouthed Latino gangbanger?Good action scenes realistically staged. If I was to have one complaint we never see them do enough paperwork or deal with the myriad of trivial yet time consuming calls which make up a police officer's real workload. We hear that they stand for 2 hours on the crime scene but get no sense of the time spent. Clever ending scene when we find out one of our heroes actually survived but I would like to have had a better final shot, maybe a zoom in on the fallen officer's LAPD badge followed by a pull out to reveal it on the side of a cruiser going on a call?",End of Watch

First and foremost the way this movie is shot just doesn't work. It's a part found footage sort of movie, and part flat out poorly shot, because unlike the footage shot in a horror found footage movie in which all the characters really have to do is film, scream, hide, run away etc, but if you're a cop there's quite a lot you can't film because you're way too busy doing your job, so who films all that stuff? Well I'm guessing that a ghost of a dead amateur cameraman or something follows the two lead cops around, and occasionally a group of very poorly written street thugs, which partly explains some of the awful camera movements which lets be clear on this are only there to make this feel ""edgy"" and ""real"", despite the fact that the star of the show is an A-list Hollywood actor and this is no more of a real cop movie than say ""Die hard"", or ""Lethal weapon"". And lastly on the subject, no cop would be given permission to film themselves in this way, because it's dangerous, unlawful, and unprofessional, and why the gangs members are also filming themselves is even more nonsensical as there is zero reason behind them doing it. This really wanted to be an overall insight into police life, so there's aimless banter between characters, they bend the rules at times, there's paper work, shoot-outs, boring jobs to do, weddings, births, wives, etc but the fact is that we already know all this stuff, so there really is no insight to anything shown here.

Also the performances by the cast was immaculate they all did such a great job.This movie is about two young officers who while making a routine traffic stop one day discover a bunch of money and guns. The money and guns just so happens to belong to the Mexican cartel and then they put a hit out on the two young poilcemen.This movie was just fantastic a heartracing thrill ride from start to finish. The acting was perfect and I definitely consider this one of my favorite movies no right along with American History X and Training Day. Watch this movie right now!,End of Watch
79,Shopaholic35,A gritty cop movie that is so much more than it first seems.,6,2 February 2014,"I was a bit worried as the first 10mins of the movie made it seem like the movie was going to be a bust but thankfully it picked up quick. It is a gritty look into crime-riddled poverty stricken America. It felt real and full of heightened emotions. I know I am very lucky to live in a place that isn't swarming with guns and weapons. Just the thought of going through what the cops would go through every day sends fear through my body. Sometimes that much crime and danger can corrupt a society but it's nice to see true moments of morality come out every now and then.I feel sorry for the people who have to suffer through that sort of life in the real world and I commend the people who work so hard to drag themselves out of that environment. I know it mustn't be easy. It seems such a waste of human life. I'm glad I watched this movie because it shows a world that I have never experienced in all it's disgusting realness and it makes me appreciate my life and all the opportunities I have. And have some respect for police officers, if this doesn't show you how much they care about society than nothing will. As I like to say if you do nothing illegal/wrong then you won't ever have to feel ""victimised"" by them. You try putting yourself in harms way every day and see if you can still remain as level-headed as the majority of them do. One bad apple does not ruin the entire bunch.",End of Watch

83,cardsrock,Chemistry is key,8,29 February 2020,"Most cop movies live or die by the chemistry between the leads. End of Watch features excellent chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Pena, which elevates the film a notch above the typical cop drama. The found-footage style of filmmaking works pretty well for police movies in that it adds a grittiness necessary to realistically represent the story. There are plenty of tense moments and thrilling sequences to satisfy any action junkie, but the moments focusing on the characters and their lives is where End of Watch shines. The point of this film is to portray a realistic life as a police officer in the LA ghetto and the film definitely succeeds in that regard.",End of Watch
84,CANpatbuck3664,"One of My Favourite Movies, End of Watch Features Two Fun and Believable Lead Performances, Great Laughs, and Intense Action",10,14 August 2016,"I was really excited to see this in theatres, I thought the trailer looked good but I have to admit what really sold it to me was that it was from the writer from Training Day. I'm not big into found-footage movies, there's been so many of them, the gimmick doesn't feel fresh anymore. Even though it wasn't playing anywhere near me, I made the trip with my best friend and we both walked out of the movie with our jaws hitting the floor. It's easily the best found footage movie that I've ever seen and it's also easily the best work of it's writer/director David Ayer.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* The movie begins with a police chase being recorded from a dashboard camera. Officer Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) is delivering a monologue about how he's required to take these criminals down. It doesn't matter if he agrees with the law, it's his job to put these guys in a cage. He's chasing these guys with his partner officer Mike Zavala (Michael Pena) and after he's finally run them off the road, there's a shootout. They are able to put these guys down and the tape ends with them waiting for backup.We then join them again at the precinct, in the locker room. Brian introduces himself as an officer of the LAPD. He shows them his locker, the equipment he's carrying on a daily basis and even briefly introduces his partner Mike and another officer Van Hauser (David Harbour). Van Hauser isn't too keen on Taylor taping everything and tells him he's going to report him. Taylor and Zavala laugh it off and head out. Next we see them with the other officers in their division. Their Sargent (Frank Grillo) is assigning them to certain districts in their city and their superior Captain Reese shows up. Reese tells the rest of the unit that Taylor and Zavala were cleared in the shooting of the previous police chase. He doles out the assignments and they head out to try and make a difference.I stated in the opening that found-footage is a gimmick, it's no longer new and exciting and frankly I'm getting tired of it. I bring that up again because for a found-footage movie, End of Watch is really well shot. There are some scenes where there are very cool camera angles, the action scenes are coherent (something that found-footage movies just can't seem to get) and exciting. People have complained that there are bits where its not completely clear who's holding the camera and I won't disagree. But I think the fact that the movie is so well filmed helps you gloss over that and I've never had a problem when watching it.End of Watch has a plot arc but most of the movie feels like what its pretending to be, a sampling of a few days in the lives of these guys. Again, I found this to be more effective than your standard plot line. The stuff these guys have to deal with is crazy and while I'm sure most of the cops in L.A. don't have to deal with all of this on a daily basis, I could see a lot of this going down. It keeps the movie moving at a quick pace and you don't know what's going to happen next.In my opinion what makes this movie special is the interplay between the characters. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena are great together and by themselves. You completely buy them as best friends and people who would be hanging out together day in and day out. They're actually really funny in the scenes that they are just driving around and considering how dark this movie gets, its some much needed levity. A lot of the supporting characters do a good job too. Natalie Martinez, Anna Kendrick, David Harbour, America Ferrera and Frank Grillo are all fun to watch in their respective roles. Some people complain about the gang villains and I would agree that their acting isn't terribly strong. I don't have a problem with that though, the movie is about Taylor and Zavala's friendship, not about them taking on the cartel.I've watched this movie more than a few times and I love it each time I watch it. The movie moves quickly, there's a lot of great acting, a believable feel to it and it gives you main characters that you want to root for. I'm so glad I took the time to search it out when it was in theatres and although it didn't get the awards attention that they probably wanted, it does have quite the following. It's easily one of my favourite movies (definitely one of the best in the past few years). It shows the talent that David Ayer has and even though not every movie he's made has been excellent (Sabotage was disappointing), he's very good at what he does and I hope he gets more good projects going forward.",End of Watch
85,Laakbaar,Realistic cop buddy movie,9,18 November 2012,"In this cop movie, we follow Mike Zavala (Michael Pena) and Brian Taylor (Jake Gillenhaal) as they patrol South Central over the course of a year or so. We see them in action in a number of harrowing, violent scenes. They work in a dangerous part of town and deal rather fearlessly with the thugs and gangbangers they come across. Because they're good at their jobs, and have stumbled onto certain things, they come to the attention of a ruthless Mexican cartel and a vicious local gang.This is a gripping movie. Much of the tension comes from following them as they approach each situation without knowing what to expect. The menace and danger is palpable. You really get a sense of what these cops have to face. They are heroic and tough and very much into their work, but yet completely vulnerable. This is a true cop movie.The camaraderie between Mike and Brian is at the heart of the film. We get to know their world, particularly the other cops in their unit and their women. The actors are well cast and the acting in this movie is superb.The writing and dialogue are also excellent. It's hard for me to assess this accurately, but Ayer's characters seem to speak with authentic dialects, using the right often profane slang. Maybe the Mexicans would be speaking Spanish though. And surely cops don't talk like that all the time. I'm glad I saw it with subtitles because some of it was too fast to follow.Much of the movie is devoted to the slangy, coarse and often amusing dialogue between these two cops. Their interaction really brings the movie to life. This unusually good character development achieves the desired effect: these are characters the viewer comes to care deeply about. I can't emphasise enough how good the acting was here. There was barely a dry eye in the house at the end.This movie has car chases, shootouts and extreme violence, things that normally turn me off. However, most of the violence is not shown directly and it did seem related to the movie's plot. However, if you have a problem with gore, violence, profanity, racist expressions or shaky cams, you better skip this one.I see this one as about 8.5. I usually round down, but I think I have to round it up this time. This movie is far better than Act of Valor. You can't even compare the two.",End of Watch
86,dfa120374,"Gritty & Hard Hitting, But An Excellent Movie.",8,10 December 2014,"End Of Watch is a powerful story about two cops Brian Taylor (Gyllenhaal) & Mike Zavala (Peña) who work in the notoriously tough South Central side of L.A. We join them as they go on a series of different calls (one of which puts them into the path of the Mexican Cartel) and it's all shot from a ""point of view"" perspective, but it's not just about them on the job. It's also a story of the friendship between the two cops, getting to know each of them and getting to see the loyalty they have for each other.This is a very gritty and tough film and while some of it may have a touch of Hollywood about it, a lot of it is probably not too far off of what the police in South Central have to deal with. It's got a very realistic feel to it, and with the way it's shot and filmed, you are actually drawn into it all and you're right there with them. The ending scene's of the movie were by far the best part's, though, and for me they made the movie that much better.End Of Watch has got to be one of Jake Gyllenhaal's best role's (if not maybe the best) that I've seen him play and the on-screen partnership between himself and Michael Peña is excellent. They are totally believable as two of L.A.'s South Central cops, and this is a movie that is most definitely worth watching.",End of Watch
87,billygoat1071,Police Point of View,8,5 October 2012,"End of Watch seems to be another film that uses the found-footage style, but once again it's not a successful try. However, it still gets what it wants by being a true to life buddy cop film with a ridiculous amount of intensity. End of Watch looks pretty simple as a crime thriller, but everything is actually brilliant. The crimes are grim and the action is a load of thrills. But what really makes this film so appealing is the chemistry between Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña. Their bromantic moments keeps the entire film so charming. The rest of End of Watch is engaging and interestingly gripping.The story is about the lives of the lead pair. As these police officers patrol around the streets, they spend their time talking and joking around until they see something going on. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña brings it to life. Their chemistry is the magic of this film. When it gets serious it becomes really intense, makes you wish both of them are safe on their dangerous jobs. The common elements of cop movies are explosions and stylish gunfights, but this film is all about tension and momentum.The found-footage style is as messy as what the recent found-footage film, Chronicle, did. Which falls into being unnecessary. It sometimes gets shots that aren't filmed on any hand-held cameras. The camera-work is still well shot and serves a different experience, but it could have been something like what action directors, Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor(strangely has the same name of the main character), do. Shaking the camera ridiculously without calling it a found-footage film. If you ignore the style, it would be cool. The quality of the film is being realistic and there it succeeds. They left the impossibly cool police movie stuff behind and instead make them simply scrutinize, arrest, and watch the streets.End of Watch doesn't have much of a concept but to depict the credible lives of these hero cops. While the lead stars shine on their beautiful down-to-earth bromance, there's a grim reality about to affect their lives thus makes this an indeed so compelling film. Still, it could have been a Crank like film than a found-footage. The crazy cam is a great effect, but not the characters holding the camera. Aside from that, it's a top notch thriller that is easy enough to enjoy. Worth a ride and recommended.",End of Watch
88,christophe92300,Good cop movie,7,30 January 2013,"David Ayer, a cop movie regular, served here a good chronicle on the lives of those men.Gyllenhaal and Peña are impeccable in their roles and the duo works perfectly, transcribing a real complicity between the two actors.The script isn't exceptional but overall very dynamic and captivating, and a real sense of realism emerges which contributes to the quality of this movie.However, certain aspects raise some questions. First, the choice of a subjective camera, which turns of to be messy sometimes and not that necessary, Brian's project being of no use for the story since it is never brought up later. Second, the shootout scene would have been excellent if it wasn't vitiated by flagrant illogical behaviors. Finally, it's hard to understand why Ayer didn't choose to end the movie right after the funeral: what was the point of adding a flashback that serves no purpose at this moment ? Probably a studio decision...",End of Watch

In particular, a good portion of the script are F-words.

90,TheSquiss,"Two good cops, a rotten city and a stunning screenplay.",8,5 December 2012,"Don't watch the trailer for End of Watch. Just take the plunge with the full film.But for the stubborn amongst you, here it is.The issue with the trailer is that it creates expectation of a big event with substantial consequences to follow. I spent three quarters of the film waiting for that event to occur, only to discover it comprises the final quarter of the film and pretty much end things. It is yet another example of a distributor's inability to cut a trailer that teases and entices and opting instead to slap together the 'best bits' in a montage that entertains but fails in its task.In End of Watch we experience the lives of two cops, Brian (Jake Gyllenhall) and Mike (Michael Peña), their partnership, their friendship and their relationships with their colleagues and significant others. Of course a large part of that is crime fighting, but that is what happens not what it is about.The principal joy of End of Watch is that both cops are actually decent people and not the usual warring, unhinged, drug-addled crooks we are usually faced with. They are far from being angels but who'd want that? What they are, however, is idealistic, determined, driven, passionate and a little foolhardy. And that just happens to irk their colleagues slightly and really upset some of the big players on the scuzzy side of town.That End of Watch is both co-written and directed by David Ayer, the scribe behind Training Day, is an indication of the grit and impact this offering will have on you. At times the pace is frenetic with cameras crashing through scenes and characters often not making it into the frame, though never by mistake. There is sufficient action to keep those with the shortest attention spans amused, but that is merely a supplement (a fantastic supplement, mind you) to a screenplay that stings and amuses in the way real conversations with genuine, loving, bickering best friends do.Though the supporting turns dance in perfect time on the periphery, this is absolutely the Gyllenhall and Peña show. They wind each other up, they yell at each other, they laugh at each other's jokes, attend each other's family functions and would willingly take a bullet for the other and then look after their dependents. There is never any sign of mushiness but we are in no doubt they are absolutely devoted to each other and that both men bruise for their partner.Standing tall amongst the supporting players are Anna Kendrick as Brian's girlfriend and Natalie Martinez as Mike's loyal wife. Though on the sidelines of the film and of secondary importance to their men, both characters are clearly in it for the long run and each woman understands her man's foibles and needs as much as any LA cop's wife can. The sincerity in both their performances makes the emotional hits even harder for us to take as we watch real, not performed, reactions.There is a danger that End of Watch will slip through without many noticing while attention is diverted by showier action films like Jack Reacher and Skyfall. Shameful as that will be, word of mouth ensured Training Day enjoyed more life on DVD than it ever did on the big screen and I suspect End of Watch will prove to be a more fulfilling and less flawed filmic experience than either Jack Reacher or Skyfall in the long run.Oh, a word of warning to those who share my ommatophobia. Grit your teeth. There's a particular scene you're really going to struggle with!

91,andrewroy-04316,"A realistic look at the life of a police officer, but lacking in depth",4,15 September 2020,"I will give End of Watch for the one thing it does well: present the life of a police officer in a more realistic way than the majority of shows and movies. The cops are real people here, certainly flawed and imperfect but also trying to do their jobs and ready to face danger to help others. The day to day life and the practical elements of how cops hear and react to live situations was much better done here than in other media. However, this realism is the only real strength of the film to me. Gyllenhaal was the main reason I watched the movie, and while he is solid as always, the script only gives him so much to work with. Pena is actually very strong here, and I'd like to see more dramatic turns from him. Kendrick is completely wasted, and the side plot of their relationship was undeveloped and merely a plot device to add something to Taylor's character. The plot is very thin, a simplified LA gang war where the gang wants the cops to stop snooping around. We don't get to see any nuance or any real characters on the side of the gangs, and we don't really get to understand the details of what the gangs are doing other than selling drugs and some sort of human trafficking. While we do get the real sense that the cops are putting their lives at risk to stop these people, it doesn't mean much when we scarcely understand why they need to take the actions they do. Gyllenhaal and Pena have solid chemistry here, and their friendship is undoubtedly the core of the film, but I didn't find either character to be very well written, developed, or interesting. Early on I hoped and thought the film would more intentionally consider the moral ambiguity of police officers, particularly as we see Taylor not hesitate to use force even when if his hunch is wrong, someone could be hurt or killed. Unfortunately this was never explored in the script and is something I wonder about but the movie does nothing with. I also thought the editing was extremely poor. I like the idea of Taylor wanting to document what they're doing, but in that case there should be clear cinematographic delineation between what he is shooting and what we see external from the on site cameras. Instead, Ayer bizarrely operates all the cameras in a shaky, difficult to tell what's happening way when that makes no sense with respect to Taylor's shooting. This problem is exacerbated by Ayer's extreme overcutting. If we're seeing this as a mocumentary style film from Taylor's perspective, then we should have few cuts and see it from one or a few cameras with few cuts to emphasize the real nature of the footage. The constant cuts, especially in action scenes, ruin this real camera gimmick and make it harder to tell what's going on. I also didn't love the ending, as it felt a little implausible for Taylor to survive after that much time with that much blood, and even that is assuming that his camera significantly blunted the bullet force and that miraculously none of the many bullets the cartel shoot at him and Zevala manage to hit him after the first. There are some good things here, but the editing issues are truly inexplicable and problematic, and the plot, characters, and themes are all subpar.",End of Watch

95,Cinemaniac1984,"Surprisingly enjoyable with a mixture of intense drama, humour and confronting moments.",9,11 September 2016,"End of Watch was surprisingly cleverly done from start to finish. It looks like a derivative police procedural action drama on paper, however in the hands of writer/director David Ayer (Training Day, Street Kings) and with Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena as the charismatic leads, End of Watch was a pleasure to watch from start to finish and also one of the most memorable movies of 2012.The movie focuses on inseparable LAPD patrol officers Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal, Donnie Darko) and Mike Zavala (Michael Pena, Shooter) who patrol one of the most dangerous divisions of Los Angeles. As part of a filmmaking class, Taylor is filming his day to day activities while on duty much to the chagrin of fellow officers including Van Hauser (David Harbour, The Equalizer), Sarge (Frank Grillo, Captain America: The Winter Soldier), Orozco (America Ferrara, Ugly Betty), and Davis (Cody Horn, Magic Mike). Taylor and Zavala find themselves in gun fights, fist fights, dealing with gang members, and rescuing those in harms way. Apart from bonding over crude banter, sarcasm, machismo and the unwritten rule of having each other's backs, we also venture outside their professional lives and explores the personal relationships with Taylor's girlfriend Janet (Anna Kendrick, Pitch Perfect) and Zavala's wife Gabby (Natalie Martinez, Under the Dome).Jake Gyllenhaal, as always is excellent and he has come a long way from his groundbreaking role in Donnie Darko (2001) which made audiences sit up and take notice of the new talent on the bloke. Michael Pena always does a fine job and here it is no different.David Ayer has always been a talented writer following his work with U-571 (2000) and Training Day (2001) and he is gradually making his mark as a director with Harsh Times (2005) and Street Kings (2008). Here in End of Watch, he feels like his is just right at home.End of Watch is a violent movie with some unsettling moments and with 326 uses of the f word, it is certainly a movie for mature audiences.End of Watch looked to be a run of the mill crime drama but upon watching it at the cinema, this movie left an impressionable mark on me. From start to finish, End of Watch is a combination of intense drama, plenty of humour, and some very confronting moments. It certainly is a movie that I enjoy watching from time to time and it now sits upon my DVD/Blu-Ray collection.9/10.",End of Watch

Talk about Mis-casting!,2,30 October 2013,"In South Central Los Angeles, street cops Brian and Mike are partners - balls-out cowboys patrolling the streets as Latino gangs are in a power struggle with Blacks. Brian and Mike get lucky a couple of times, making big drug and human-trafficking busts, so a Mexican cartel orders their deaths. We meet Mike's pregnant wife (whom he married out of high school) and watch Brian's search for a soul mate. There are internal squabbles within the ranks of the LAPD and lots of squad-car conversation. Can the lads escape the cartel's murderous reach?Firstly, whomever cast Jake Gylentaal in this picture needs psychological. He's a coddles elitist who knows nothing about police work and it shows. His idea of owning the character was shaving his head. Wow! Edgy Jake.He brings down the movie.The film is also cheaply made using hand held cameras trying to capitalize on this style of film making that's supposed to be cutting edge except everybody does it and it's annoying. It's a replacement for good film making.Also, why this movie was made at all is a mystery. It's been done countless times before and better. Sean Penn and Robert Duvall made it 25 years ago in Colors directed by Dennis Hopper. No creativity whatsoever in this movie. Oh and then there's the obligatory peppering of the film with rap music. As if the cops are listening to tunes composed by thugs who want them dead.But back to high, thin, voiced Jake. He's horrible. No charisma at all and no relationship with his partner.

98,LloydBayer,"A must-watch, right through the end!",8,2 January 2013,"END OF WATCH begins like an episode on TV's COPS. With a dashboard mounted camera, we get a first-person perspective of how it feels to be driving through alleyways in a police car. As part of a film school project, LAPD Officer Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) captures a chase sequence while elaborating a police officer's code on what it means to serve and protect ""the prey from the predators"". In the driver's seat, his partner Mike Zavala (Michael Peña) keeps up the pursuit until the chase ends in an exchange of gunfire. At first glance, this opening sequence has the type of familiarity that comes from gung-ho 'buddy-cop' movies like BAD BOYS or LETHAL WEAPON and its sequels. Before you know it, the second and third acts draw you deeper into an incredible story of brotherhood that is as touching as its intense narrative on fighting the good fight.The setup has uniformed LAPD officers Taylor and Zavala doing the rounds, and at times responding to 911 calls via a dispatch radio frequency. Their job takes them through various locations in South Central Los Angeles while patrolling the streets - the modern policing term for 'walking the beat'. They are good at what they do and they know it. But given the hierarchy of the police force, the fact remains that they are out-ranked by detectives, let alone higher ranking federal agents. Deemed overzealous by colleagues and commanding officers, Taylor and Zavala follow a hunch and discover the presence of a Mexican drug cartel in Los Angeles. As long term partners, they are quick to learn that this case is way bigger than their combined pay grades. What they don't know is how dangerously close they are to being assassinated by the cartel. Having conceived titles like TRAINING DAY and DARK BLUE, Writer-director David Ayer is a creative genius with an affinity for solid police dramas set within Los Angeles, but perfectly suited with a buddy-cop premise. Besides the well written and original screenplay, what works here is the bromantic chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Peña. As the film progresses, we come to appreciate how different they are ethnically but how united they are as partners upholding the law. Individualistically, they have different ideas from dating to starting a family. In expressing these beliefs, albeit on patrol, Ayer lightens the story from its increasingly dark tone. One particular scene right before the end credits has Zavala recount a hilarious traumatic event while dating his girlfriend when they were teenagers - priceless! Then we are introduced to the women in their lives; Natalie Martinez as Zavala's wife Gabby, and Anna Kendrick as Taylor's new girlfriend Janet. Adding romantic ties to active duty cops induces an element of impending doom, but this is where Ayer has Taylor and Zavala charm the audience to a point of no return. We start to like them with or without the badge and gun; we laugh at their racial squabbling; we approve their methods of fighting crime; but by the time we get to the end of the movie, we feel the evil closing around them and hope that they survive till the end. Some questionable camera angles aside, END OF WATCH is in a distinguished class of its own. It is the type of rough and tough cop-thriller that isn't afraid to say that behind the badge and Kevlar is a living, breathing human being. This is where Ayer's story hits an emotional but very real note in commending the lives of those who bravely choose to protect their fellowmen. Besides charismatic performances from Gyllenhaal and Peña, I recommend this film for its modest take on urban crime fighting and why each of us, civilians or otherwise, have a role to play in safeguarding society from pure evil.",End of Watch
99,diac228,Intense Cop Drama with a Best Picture feel,9,22 October 2012,"The world may definitely end in 2012 because the best film of the year is one with a ""found footage"" style of filmmaking.End of Watch is a spectacular, haunting, and intense journey through the lives of two police officers and their squadron as well as the families of the main characters involved. While I expected good material from the man that helmed the script for the eternally underrated Training Day, I didn't expect to be overwhelmed, moved, and totally embedded in the lives of the characters presented. Unlike most films about cops which usually are presented as dirty, lazy, or with cruel intentions, this one showcases cops as homeland soldiers in the brutal battlefield of the ghettos and the underworld. This film may possibly even change your stance on policemen.The plot is simple; it follows two cops (Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena) in the course of around a year as they fight crime in the underbelly of one of the toughest parts of the country. Using secret cameras attached to their uniform they show the viewer the behind-the-scenes moments within the police department and then display some of the situations they get involved in—from the tiny disturbance calls to the more violent incidents that can occur in any time.As if the writer used to be a cop himself (his research on the LAPD has definitely helped), David Ayer composed a script that not only throws our foot soldiers out into the crime world, but also gives us a glimpse into their social lives and how they remain connected with the job. And it is not just the script that made this cop flick unique, it was the cinematography. With the shaky found footage style, End of Watch comes off as much more realistic as the norm as the close-ups are intense, the action is right on your face, and sometimes the gruesome images find its way in center frame far longer than you desire.Chemistry runs this film, and brings the dialogue to life. Jake Gyllenhaal is very hit-and-miss but delivers by far his best performance of his career as the hotshot cop with subtle issues that pops out every so often during the shift. Supporting him is the equally impressive Michael Pena as the Mexican cop that despite his obvious differences with his partner is an excellent companion as well as friend. Helping round out the cast are the hilarious sweethearts Anna Kendrick and Natalie Martinez.This film doesn't have the summer blockbuster feel, it has the crime drama touch that combines itself with some hyperrealism through the kinetic filming style while adding the necessary humor and heart to maintain the film flowing without it becoming too overly dramatic or depressing. It is essentially the best film of the year because it delivers a powerful experience that never feels contorted, never feels cliché, and in a subtle manner celebrates one of the most heroic occupations in the country.Kind of like Training Day.And if your film deserves to be compared to that gem, then your film is worthy of recommendation.",End of Watch
100,dansview,Totally Unoriginal,6,26 July 2016,"Hey, let's make a movie about a cocky average-sized white male cop who patrols the streets of South Central with a smirk on his face. Throw in the obligatory Hispanic stereotype as a partner and some cardboard gangsters. Oh wait a minute. Someone already did that in the 80's. It was called ""Colors."" Except that one had an old guy in place of the Mexican guy.In this one, we are never told why the white guy is a cop, nor what is his philosophy of life. If he's so ""alpha,"" does he have some kind of code to espouse? Who is his family and where is he from?There is not a single cop depicted in this one who shares with the audience a belief in God, or any kind of old-school philosophy. Are we to believe that every uniformed cop is a foul-mouthed low-life? At least the old guy in Colors was interesting.Are we to believe that all uniformed cops are alpha-dogs who relish a good fight and swear incessantly? There must be other types. They do show one female who is not macho, but she doesn't do well. It would have been interesting to see an ex-athlete who sees the daily patrol as a contest requiring courage and endurance. Or perhaps a Christian who sees mankind as sinful but deserving a benefit of the doubt from time to time.Do all gangsters really indulge in clichéd machismo and posturing? Actually a lot do probably. But some are just sociopaths who don't think about it one way or the other. The brother/buddy concept was just too mushy for me and too clichéd. How many times have we seen this? There must be partners who don't feel that, but still have each other's back.I could have done without the filming gimmick. Just show me their day without one of them supposedly taking footage for a class. The violence was gritty and seemed real. If you like that sort of thing, you will like it here. Some reviewers said that there was no conflict here or point to it. I agree, but in some ways that made it a deeper commentary on the pointlessness of life. These guys live, they talk like low-lives, they shoot up some gangsters, and they wind up in deep trouble, as you may expect. Life's a bitch.",End of Watch

102,markgorman,Amazing acting. A great movie. I didn't want it to end.,9,26 November 2012,"I wasn't expecting all that much having turned up for a mid Monday afternoon showing of a cop movie by a director I didn't know.Mid November. The Auditorium was nearly full! I was taken aback. And then perhaps 2012's movie of the year unfolded. (A good starting point was that it was Studio Canal funded. I always like that.) What follows is 2 hours of engrossing cinema without peer this year. The relationship between Jake Gylenhall and Michael Pena has to be seen to be believed (it maybe even challenges that of Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquim Pheonix in the Master). It has similarities to The Master in that the plot is, at best, loose but it matters less here because one is so utterly absorbed in the unfolding relationship between the white and Latino ""brothers"" and ""heroes"" that Gylenhall and Pena become.The movie is episodic. Each building the picture of two committed cops who live for the badge but have a life beyond it. And set in a horrifying community of black and Hispanic (specifically Mexican) warfare and bad Mutha's. (If bad language offends you I'd give this movie a swift sidestep.) Shot hand held, with a slightly ropey reasoning for this, it feels as real as a documentary and that's really the strength behind it. Because you are drawn into the characters' reality. A reality that revolves around a range of truly harrowing day to day high(low)lights to buddy chat that's hilarious in a South Central LA that is scary. Real scary because the bad ass men (and women) in this movie are baaaad aaaaass.It's brilliantly directed from the off by David Ayer (better known as a writer) and the early scene in which Gylenhall and Pena cruise the streets of LA to the soundtrack, super-loud, of Public Enemy's ""Harder than you Think"" really does set the scene.Later, but early in the development, the boys do a raid on a house, seemingly innocent, the discovery (one of many) that follow actually chills the blood. It's a jaw dropping moment. And one I won't forget in a long time . And what's more, it felt like you were there in the building with them.This is great movie making. Completely shocking, utterly beguiling. Hard and yet soft. Loving yet hateful.It's 2012's Drive without the gloss.It's a 9/10 must see.",End of Watch
103,HelenMary,gripping visceral docu-film thankfully punctuated by humour,8,29 November 2012,"Gripping realism, edge of seat tension, visceral reactions, a wide range of emotions as well as a lot of authentic humour.In short, it's a hand-held camera-style 'fly on the wall' look at two cops and their experiences in South Central LA in the midst of the gang warfare and general violence as well as inter-cop camaraderie and rivalries. It's the realism that makes this so palpably stressful. You learn about the two cops (played by Gyllenhaal and Pena) really quickly - their dedication, friendship, flaws and prejudices - and through the medium of the camera, explained at the beginning, you are dragged front-and-centre along with them on their shifts. Being so close to the action makes it so tense. It's not a Hollywood film, and whilst I'd seen the trailers thankfully I still didn't know what to expect. It comes across as relatively low budget, and the Director did everything very concisely and in a clipped fashion which made for faster pace, closer to the action drama and a more believable narration of events.Do not see this if you don't like excessive bad language, violence or are of a little bit of a nervous twitchy or squeamish disposition but to be honest, I expected it to be a lot worse in terms of horrible plot and vileness. I'm glad it only touched on the cases and wasn't a one-case-is-solved-by-the-end sort of movie. The call-outs were interspersed with really LOL humour and ride-along banter between the cops, which dilutes the tension, leaving it like a feature length documentary. There isn't much of a plot other than the meandering story that is the relationship between Brian and Mike so if you like fast paced action, twists and turns, and a real thinker of a film this isn't for you. In saying that, this is a thinker of a film in that it stays with you, the energy of it and the emotion. I want to say this is a gentle film, because of the meandering conversational feel to the direction, but with all the horrible things our heroes witness and have to deal with it is by no means an easy view. You do feel a little shredded by the end. Reminiscent of Street Kings for its seedy underbelly of LA and back streets and vacant lot action, this is going to turn some heads for the different approach to filming. A(nother) brave move for Gyllenhaal and a great boost for Pena in a supporting role. Honorable mention to the always watchable Anna Kendrick, and I thought Natalie Martinez was very good too. Also to mention a somewhat strangely cast America Ferrera (Ugly Betty) in a minor supporting role.",End of Watch
104,nickmesafilms,End of Watch (2012) - Let's Take This Time to Respect Our Police Officers!,9,29 December 2012,"David Ayer, writer of the film ""Training Day"", writes and directs this 109-minute police drama discussing the dangerous profession of being a LAPD officer in the middle of an underworld of shootings, homicides, drugs, and kidnapping. Told through a similar style of found footage photography, ""End of Watch"" stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena as two young LA officers who are on the run, trying to take down the members of a drug cartel, after discovering small caches of money and firearms during a traffic stop. Preparing for their roles, Gyllenhaal and Pena actually spent five months training as LA officers, by under- going a variety of 12-hour ride-alongs. The practice definitely paid off, since these two professional actors shared electrifying chemistry with one another, giving the audience full belief that these are real officers working in LA, than just actors reading lines. Each of these actors delivering one memorable performance after the next: Gyllenhaal as a young officer recently starting a relationship with Anna Kendrick, and Pena as a married man with a new baby about to arrive. Watching these two actors deliver fantastically driven performances are the stuff of Oscar nominations. The fantastically well-written dialouge shared between Gyllenhaal and Pena during their patrol ride-alongs feel clever and realistic, while the already-tired concept of found-footage footage, surprisingly does a unique job at capturing the rough and dangerous world of LA and it's police officers. However, ""End of Watch"" doesn't deliver a main focus as it was promised from the trailer, as it seemed that these two might be on the verge of losing their jobs after a crazy discovery. But as it turns out, it's only focus is Pena and Gyllenhaal breaking through doors and arresting suspects. But these graphic and haunting scenes still, not for the faint of heart, work really well in the film, capturing an incredibly dark world where not everyone follows the law. *SPOILER ALERT* - Although the found-footage art-form worked really well in the scenes were Gyllenhaal and Pena are on the field, it did, however, strike me odd that the main villains leading the drug cartel are carrying cameras around as well. I didn't really believe it was the smartest move, and we were just better off driving that police car. But, this is one of the most memorable movies of the year that audiences will hopefully walk out with a shining respect for our boys on the field. From two Oscar-worthy performances, great writing, and a heartbreaking final act, nobody should miss this movie!

105,dvc5159,"Bad boys, what're you gonna do when they come for you",8,22 September 2012,"David Ayer's ""End of Watch"" opens excitingly with a narration by Jake Gyllenhaal's Officer Brian which trails a car chase. Once the action ends, we are introduced to Brian's partner, Mike (Michael Pena) and his squad who serve and protect the streets of Los Angeles.What makes Ayer's film compelling are many factors. Firstly, the terrific chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Pena. These two bounce each other off so naturally, you'd forget you're watching a movie. Even their comrades, friends and family (Anna Kendrick, Natalie Martinez, David Harbor, America Ferrara) form a circle around them to which they interact naturally among one another. It's their lives.Another factor is that of the editing. The film is filmed using the usual hand-held first person cinematography, as Brian is doing a law degree and has to pick an elective, so he chooses filmmaking. He intends to make a documentary about police life, with Mike helping him. Through this technique, a day in the life of a street cop could not be more natural. Criminals are caught, children are rescued from a burning house, capture of drug shipments, etc. Meanwhile, the villains of the movie, an angry gang mad at the cops for retrieving money, drugs and weapons following a bust, marks the cops for death, and one of them carries a video camera to record their exploits, perhaps hoping that they'll be famous one day. It's interesting to see Ayer juxtapose the different points of view while at the same time adding third person cinematography. It makes the film more compelling to watch.And then there is the violence and shootouts, a staple of Ayer. It is brutal, it is shocking, it is fast, and it is graphic, just like in real life. Ayer knows realism. He bleeds it. His filmography is comprised mostly of crime/cop dramas, so he knows what he's writing and directing about.All in all, it was an intense and quite emotional movie to watch. The banter between Gyllenhaal and Pena may form an emotional impression on others. And I would say that the touching closing scene of this movie couldn't bring that point home any further.Overall: 81%",End of Watch
106,ragingbull_2005,Very Highly Recommended,8,25 November 2012,"This is a brilliant movie, easily among the best cop movies I have seen this or any other year. Pena and Gyllenhaal are police officers and partners. They are more like brothers. Jake is making a documentary on LAPD for his private viewing and we see much of the movie through the eye of his camera lens and also through miniature cameras placed on the chest button of both the police men. Through the twist of fate, they hurt a cartel twice and are marked for death by the Godfather. The camaraderie between the cops is natural, the acting is exceptionally heartfelt. There are many scenes which will stay with you even after the movie has ended and the one where Pena squares off against a much bigger African American is the one which I can easily recall. There is a coherent story and you can actually see the characters mature and grow before you. The editing is world class and there is not a single superfluous scene. This is a truly amazing experience and will bring you face to face with the harsh realities the policemen face every day. Very highly recommended. 4 out of 5.",End of Watch

108,ritera1,"Not much to it but, in the end, very effective.",9,11 February 2020,"Especially the ending. Frightening.Very powerful way to open a movie like this with the Gyllenhaal monologue and then the subsequent shooting.Not sure the ""lost footage"" angle was ideal as it was noticeable when the visuals were not directly from the characters' cameras. Probably a good idea at the beginning but limited itself in the long run. Although at a budget of $7M, there was the draw that it was relatively cheap to do.Characters were clearly and quickly defined.I don't really care if the F word is used in anything, but in this it was excessive. Maybe they have a good reason from their ride-alongs and research of gang members, but it got in the way in the movie. Being that there was so much that Gyllenhaal and Pena improvised, it felt like it was just filler in-between them thinking what they wanted to do next. But, in the end, the improvisations were affable and engaging.Not sure if I'm being too politically correct but the extremity of the gang and them being hispanic was not fully balanced by Pena's role. Just as bad guys, they were very frightening, but it was a bit uncomfortable that there were no white bad guys. Yes, I know the area that the characters were in, but it is what it is.I was puzzled why the two cops had a hit out on them. Was it just because they broke up Big Evil's party? The shooting at the beginning? The arrest of the cowboy?Like I said, the ending was terrifying and done very well. I've always appreciated David Ayer's work. Didn't think that the gang would have been that dumb to stick around as long as they did vs. the certainty the cops were coming. Guess you can mention the suicidal nature of them, though, which was proven when they had a bunch of cops on them. Thus, the ending seemed much more like an action movie than a realistic drama it was up 'til that point.Rewinding, although Pena's murder was shocking, it felt like it was set up for that as he was not being aware of the very deadly threat after Gyllenhaal is shot. Broke from the character. But I guess they needed Pena's attention on Gyllenhaal to get what they wanted at the end.Recommended.",End of Watch

1. Jake Gyllenhaal (Brian Taylor) and Michael Peña (Mike Zavala) have amazing chemistry together which helps to harden the impact of the conclusion.
2. The gore is so well-designed that it looks genuine, thus helping to ground it in realism.

4. The soundtrack is great which, again, helps to ground the film in realism.
5. The movie does an imperative job of displaying how dangerous and unpredictable being a cop really is.
6. The comedy is laugh-out-loud hilarious, but it never feels out of place as it arises naturally from the fantastic chemistry between Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña.
7. Both Michael Peña and Jake Gyllenhaal provide incredible performances.Cons:
1. The vlogging aspect seems pointlessly inserted seeing as it goes nowhere, and the close-quarters camera-work already deliver the tension.
2. The law class storyline was introduced and then quickly forgotten about.
3. It's never explained why disparate groups of people have taken up vlogging.
4. How did Brian Taylor and Mike Zavala not get shot when getting sprayed at by 4 AK's?

I knew it would be good, mainly because off Jake Gyllenhaal's presence. But it isn't perfect. Like a lot off these ""caught on camera"" movies, there are moments that are very hard to make out because off the ""shaky cam"" involved, and when half the film isn't filmed in the same way, it makes you wonder why they did any off it in this way.

114,ghost_dog86,Cops are people too.,6,3 October 2012,"I guess with all of the bad publicity the LAPD has been receiving in the news recently, it was inevitable that someone in Hollywood had to come up with the concept of a 100% pro-cop movie like ""End of Watch"". In a slightly better version of ""Act of Valor"" (mainly because this one uses REAL ACTORS) but this time with the LAPD, ""End of Watch"", written and directed by David Ayer (Training Day) serves to be nothing less than a surprisingly entertaining film for two reasons alone; their names are Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena. In saying that, there is still a lot wrong with this movie, starting with Ayer's eye rolling choice to place his entire film's foundation on the shaky camera gimmick, creating many scenes of awkward POV action sequences. And to make things worse, Ayer establishes this contrivance in the beginning of the film by not only making the police carry a camera, but also having the bad guys (the gangs of L.A.) carry cameras as well. But then, about 30 minutes in, Ayer abandons his idea of telling the entire story through hand-held cameras, as he inexplicably mixes together scenes where Gyllenhaal is holding the camera, then Pena is holding it, then nobody is holding the camera, but it remains shaky nonetheless. This goes on for a while, until the very end of this film where nobody seems to have a camera at all.The Plot: When two police officers from the LAPD, Brian Taylor (Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Pena) are green lit (marked for death) after accidentally stumbling upon a large Mexican drug/human trafficking cartel, they must literally fight for their lives to protect each other, all while protecting the streets of L.A. While this rather short synopsis may deceive many readers into thinking that there is an actual plot (or point) at play here, the storyline I just laid out doesn't even arise until almost an hour in. In an attempt to establish Taylor and Zavala as likable (and ""real"") characters, for its first hour ""End of Watch"" plays out like a mindless episode of ""Cops"", but with absolutely no storyline, frankly losing its allure within about ten minutes. In fact, the only reason to pay attention to the first hour of this film is not for the scenes where Taylor and Zavala are arresting people or on high speed car chases, but for the exceptionally well written and choreographed sequences of frivolous banter between the two best friends and partners, while they ride around in the squad car waiting for something to happen. These in-between moments of levity are clearly more entertaining than any gang motivated storyline Ayer attempts to drop in our laps.During the latter portion of the film (the final 20 minutes) credit must be given to Ayer and his ability to build just the right amount of tension within the story, as to allow audiences to become invested in a somewhat predictable ending. But I'll say it again, while Ayer does a decent job of making this film better than it could have been, and while everyone in the supporting cast gives passable performances, it is the chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Pena that make this film at all watchable.Final Thought: If you hated the LAPD before this, then this isn't a movie that will change your opinion, or vice versa. But what ""End of Watch"" does succeed in doing is creating a fairly entertaining film about cops that will undoubtedly exceed the undeniably low expectations in the back of every audience members mind, as they buy tickets for a movie that clearly isn't ""Training Day"".Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

115,nesfilmreviews,Respectable with two strong lead performances.,7,21 May 2013,"David Ayer's ""End of Watch"" is an unflinching cop drama that uses the hand-held camera approach to heighten the drama and escalate the tension. ""End of Watch"" feels closest to Ayer's ""Training Day"" (2001), albeit with a bit of faux documentary footage thrown in to create a level of authenticity and credibility to what might been seen as yet another buddy cop flick. Stylistically, the 'found footage' makes its debut in this genre of film, and it leaves you wondering how much more this technique can be pushed on us without boring us, or irritating us through its constant jerkiness. ""End of Watch"" uses the much maligned tool of 'found footage' to tell the story of a couple of beat cops who do good, eventually do great, and just don't know when to stop. The narrative follows two beat cops Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Pena), buddies and best friends for life who take on the meanest districts in the city of Los Angeles. As part of a film course project, Brian carries with him a video camera to record his days at work, and ropes in Mike to also carry around pinhole cameras, which they wear at their breast pockets. Additional footage comes from the multitude of cameras strategically located in and around their patrol car, and then some. It's all not fun and games as they patrol the streets together, and we see different facets to policing, from criminal gang violence to domesticated issues, right down to an unexplored subplot involving serial gang killings. There's a maxi-arc that runs along the entire film with the Mexican drug cartels, especially with our protagonist duo taking it upon themselves to launch some deeper investigations, at times stumbling upon something much larger than what's at face value. Interestingly enough, a group of violent gang members are engaged in exactly the same sort of small-screen self-promotion, living the street life with their own cameras rolling. Eventually, the two sides, the law and the lawlessness, violently collide-with the camera's rolling the whole time. Overall, it's well-done with two solid lead performances that have a good chemistry. The overall pace of the film is quick and the action is continuous as expected. It's respectable, entertaining and worth checking out, but it's not one a would label 'a must see.' The whole 'found footage' angle to the film gets to be annoying, overused, and takes away from the overall impact of the story.",End of Watch

117,Bruce722,Great movie but the shaky camera effect was a little overdone.,8,4 March 2013,"End of Watch is one of the best cop films I've ever seen and it all starts with the fantastic cast. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña are both incredible actors and the supporting cast is just as great. Because of the entire cast's acting ability, the emotion and drama felt real and authentic and really pulled you in. The action sequences were also done really well. You felt the intensity through the realism and the emoting and it really made you get on the edge of your seat at times. I also felt the the plot developed really well. Yes, the movie dragged a bit about two- thirds in but that was necessary for the development of the characters and their relationships. Without that portion, you may not care as much so I do not hold that against the movie. The only things that I do think brought the movie down were the extreme overuse of the shaky camera effect and some of the editing of scenes felt too episodic. When you're starting to almost feel a bit dizzy because the camera is shaking so much, I'm pretty sure that means dial it back a bit. I understand that there are plenty of hand-held cameras used in the film as part of the plot but those are not the examples I'm referring to. The only other thing I felt was worth mentioning was the blatant foreshadowing in the film. There's a particular scene that essentially spoils the ending. I'm sure not everyone caught it but when I saw the scene I practically threw my hands into the air because I knew right then and there how the movie would end. I'm aware that directors love these little foreshadowing elements because it adds a certain level of cinematic quality but they're supposed to be subtle. Overall though, I'd say that this was a great movie and one that most people, at least those not easily offended by vulgar language and violence, would enjoy.",End of Watch

LA thugs soon catch up on the filming project and also start recording their daily routine, not with their phones but with giant video cameras you may remember from the nineties. The result of all this nonsense is two hours of irritating shaky camera-work, earbleedingly dumb conversation, severed limbs in every house that is entered and irrelevant scene upon scene of the cops' personal lives in between duty shifts.The film goes out of its way to make the viewer thoroughly apathetic to the events that are unfolding and the idiotic characters on display.

119,harrylosborne,A buddy cop drama with a darker undertone,7,27 April 2019,"Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena are cast to a tee for End of Watch, with their chemistry on display throughout both funny scenes and more serious matters. This found-footage piece is a rare success, developing character relations to an appropriate level, without tipping the film into a sedate police drama. Throughout the first few acts, a storyline seems to be missing, but the plot develops later on, so as not to confuse comedy with the more heavy scenes.As Gyllenhaal and Pena become more bold, they accidentally provoke people they didn't necessarily know were watching - this creates an interesting dynamic, where their safety is under constant threat without them even realising. The differences between racial classes plus the divide between the police and the public are on full display, giving LA a more complex social dynamic.End of Watch is an ideal film if you don't want to invest too much brainpower into a movie, but still provides an enjoyable experience.",End of Watch
120,Tcarts76,"A more profane version of TV's ""Southland."" But good all the same",8,13 November 2012,"""End of Watch"" is basically the day to day story of two L.A.P.D. officers, Brian (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike (Michael Pena). It takes you through they're professional live's and personal one's as well, showing us what is suppose to be the gritty streets of the not so glitzy areas of L.A. life. Like most Hollywood movies today, Director David Ayer, couldn't help but put a home movie angle of the story in as well, being sure to capture his own portion of the ""found footage"" fad. It evolves into more of a complex story, involving cartels, a street gang, moral dilemmas, and more, but I won't give too many details or give anything away.The Good: It was a well crafted drama, and does a good job building characters and making you like them. The acting was good. Gyllenhaal turned in a top notch performance as always and Michael Pena was solid as well. The story is pretty good and let's face it, the reality show ""Cops"" has been running for a longtime for the same reasons. The story seems a bit all over the place and almost documentary in style but it comes together nicely in the end. It takes awhile to draw you in but is worth watching.Anna Kendrick plays Gyllenhaal's character's girlfriend and although not featured, she did a good job and is an up and comer to watch for in the future.The Bad: The first 10 minutes or so, if you are like me anyways, you will pull your hair out and feel duped because it seems to start as another one of those ""found"" footage/home video BS things that Hollywood is trying to convince us is good film making. It's not. So quit it! The home video stuff is annoying and unnecessary. If I want to see home video I will watch my friend's boring vacation videos.It also has another filming aspect I didn't care for. In some of the action scenes the Director suddenly feels the need to put us into a first person shooter video game. While I appreciate a lot of us grew up on these types of games, I also can tell you by experience, it is boring to watch someone else play. This is another completely unnecessary ""trick."" However it did make me chuckle just a bit.Lastly, at times, this director seems to either be trying to find his own style, or is trying to combine many other director's styles. At any given time you feel as though you are watching ""Jarhead,"" then ""Traffic,"" and even a few seconds of a ""Natural Born Killers""- esque shootout.I give it an 8 out of 10. I somewhat forgive the home videos and shaky camera effect because it ended up being an entertaining watch. Those elements are pet peeves of mine, but in the end it was done somewhat right (except for the opening minutes) and I was eventually drawn into the movie. It was well acted, modern, and gritty. I deduct 2 points for the ""artistic"" camera work, and the fact that most of the movie was just a more profane version of the television series ""Southland.""

I repent. Even when watching the very start of the film, where the two main cops, Brian and Mike (Gyllenhaal and Peña, respectively), strap bug-sized cameras onto their uniforms and film everything that happens, I thought ""Oh no, this won't be done well."" But I was wrong again. And even before watching the film, I thought ""Gyllenhaal? He can't act with authority!"" and even he proved me wrong. This film simply comes out right, on the strength of a good script, good direction, good music (thank you, David Sardy and Public Enemy) and actually how it was all filmed. Somehow, it reminded me of how ""Starship Troopers"" was shot. I simply liked the sound of the film a lot; the feel was intense and good throughout. It was a film that I didn't want to turn off. I really like how there was no nonsense or sap about the action scenes, or what followed, really. Very nice one.",End of Watch
122,rgblakey,Prepare to patrol the streets of LA in End of Watch,9,20 September 2012,"With the over used popular style of the shaky cam it is quickly becoming almost as annoying as the 3D craze. There are films this works for and others that just feel forced. The latest End of Watch takes this film style and thrusts it into the world of the LAPD to attempt to deliver something a bit different. Sporting a great cast with Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena could this cop action thriller manage to work with both this film style and still deliver something different to this genre? End of Watch follows two police officers who stumble upon more than they expected and become the cartel's most wanted that puts both them and their families in the line of fire. This film actually seems to work with this style as it's told through handhelds, surveillance cameras, car cams, and gang members filming to deliver something refreshing to the played out style. While it works really great giving the film a more realistic gritty approach, it will also be sure to really bother those that are easily affected by motion sickness due to the car chases and shootouts. Gyllenhaal and Pena have not only great chemistry with each other; they both deliver Oscar worthy performances. The story here is more than the trailers let on; delivering both the action and emotional journey these guys go through on the job. While there is a lot of action it focuses more on the relationship of these two partners and the lengths they will go through in every aspect of their lives in and out of uniform.This is a dark gritty realistic portrayal of life as an officer with an intense story thrown in to up the adrenaline. Easily one of the best cop films to come along in a while that could have worked without the shaky cam approach, but seems to have actually benefited from it more than anything.",End of Watch
123,Ric-7,"Yes, it's that good",10,25 September 2012,"This is the best cop film I have seen since L.A. Confidential. And it is not at all like that earlier film. This film is basically ""hand-held"" cinematography (which I generally hate), but here it was perfect for the story.Obviously there are car chases and gunplay, but it all seemed motivated and realistic, and good people occasionally were injured, some very severely.I think the film probably has set a record for the most frequent use of the f-word in a film. If the f-word was deleted, the film would be ten minutes shorter. I mention this not as a complaint, but simply as a point of amazement.The film is more suspenseful than any horror film I've seen lately, and the screenplay is outstanding. Maybe the actors helped with improvisation, but the persons responsible for the dialogue deserve nothing but praise. The two cops were on screen about 95% of the film. They each developed their characters perfectly, and at the end, I was trying to decide who did the better job. I can't imagine how either of them could have improved his performance. The two cops had non-stop conversations through most of the film, but there are a couple of brief scenes where they say very little yet put across some thoughts that would have taken pages of words to explain.If you have not seen this film, you should not allow yourself to find out in advance how the film ends--I am not saying anything about the plot, and a spoiler here would indeed spoil what I believe to be the best film of the year. I am going back. You should see this film at least once.After seeing it a second time, I am even more amazed. There are so many surprising (and perfect) minor details. For example, the shaving cream scene and a minor detail in a subsequent scene involving the same characters. The cinematography--an absolutely beautiful shot of a sunset, used in contrast to the scene it initiates. The ""shaky-cam"" as used in the film is not a production shortcut, and it's not used because the cinematographers didn't know better. The camera work is certainly not conventional, but what you are seeing is not candid camera.The soundtrack is terrific, and note the practical use of the song ""Twilight Zone"" at a party. The sound effects editing is remarkable, and I am referring to very subtle sounds tied into the plot, rather than ear-splitters. Such as the sound in the fire scene in particular. And then there's one sound that's barely more than a click.For me, the year's best drama and the year's best comedy are both cop-buddy movies: 21 Jump Street, and End of Watch.",End of Watch
124,isantistao,Best Cop Movie Of All Time!,10,14 June 2020,"I love cop movies. And I try to watch all of them. And I am not exaggerating when I say that this is the best cop movie of all time. For the following reasons:The film making, directing, and production are quite exceptional. And you have some really great artistic actors too.It is in the ""found footage"" style, made to look as if it were filmed with camcorders hand held by the people in the movie, and other random security cams and such, which makes it feel so real and authentic, so unlike most action movies, this one really sucks you into the reality they are trying to paint for you. Everything about it is very believable and realistic unlike most action movies which are quite the opposite. And also unlike most police movies, this movie will actually give you a good idea of what it is like being a police officer in bad areas, and makes you really appreciate everything they do for us all, which most cop movies do not.The characters all seem like normal people. The two main characters are not ""action hero's"" or anything. They seem like average joe's. They are relatable. Likable. And yet as police officers they are called into many situations in which they have to step up to the plate and do heroic things which are so inspiring.It is a really great story that is not only compelling but climactic and will leave you stunned afterwards wishing it hadn't ended, wanting more, looking forward to watching it again soon. This is one of the only movies out there that I keep watching over and over and over again and it never gets old. In fact I think I enjoy it more every time I see it.This movie is not just about action, but drama. It is highly emotional and will make you cry more than just about any movie out there. It is one of the most moving films I have ever seen.This movie has several very intense moments that will make your adrenaline pump and give you a peak experience like few movies out there do, but is what we are really watching action films for. This movie does that the best and it is a real rush.So if you love action films, especially cop films, this is an absolute must see. But I also think this is just a film everyone should see because of how artistically well done it is, how moving it is, and how it shows just what our under appreciated law enforcement do for us all, and why we should appreciate them more.

Harrowing footage delivered sometimes from video cam really shows the horrors that some of the boys in blue face in South Central L.A. and surrounding areas. The movie wasn't what i thought it would be after seeing the trailer as i thought once again it was a good cop/bad cop story such as what was depicted in 'Training Day' Both of the officers Gyllenhaal and Pena this time mostly uphold the law however in a manner that might be deemed as not so straight by some. Good guys alround don't get me wrong however not the cop i bet the L.A.P.D. like to promote.I enjoyed this film immensely, and was hit by the wow! factor quite a few times as some of the scenes seem so realistically real at times it seemed like i was watching an episode of Fox's 'Cops'.

However, that was not the case with the film ""End of Watch""; not a bad film per se, but one that could have been so much better with just a few minor ""tweaks"". If director David Ayer would have just pre-screened his film and changed the last 15 minutes of this film, he just might have had a hit on his hand. Oh well, ce la vie.""End of Watch"" is a quasi-""found footage"" film in which the lead character Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) is documenting a day in the life of a LA South Central Beat Cop (himself) for an elective film course that he is taking in college. (Funny note though, of all the places he takes the camera, we never saw his class, classroom, college...hmmm). It's ""quasi"" found footage because the hand camera film footage is mixed with regular film footage, so you don't actually have that nausea you get watching a film of a guy carrying the camera all the way through the film I really despise those films; they give me such a headache!!!! Anyways, Brian and his partner Mike Zavala (Michael Pena) are LA's finest top cops. The Precinct's ""Golden Boys""!!! They do their rounds, make their busts, and treat felons and gangbangers in their patrol area fairly, and with respect. However, after a series of highly successful raids, busts, and acts of heroism; the fate of our two heroes becomes the # 1 issue of concern for the local kingpin in the barrio, and an edict is issued.I actually enjoyed 90% of this film; both Gyllenhaal and Pena have a terrific rapport on the screen. The friendly banter back and forth as they await their next call is enjoyable to witness. However, after 109 minutes of running time, an anticlimactic ending, and some real sadness, you are just leaving the theater asking yourself  WHY? The film for the most part is upbeat, entertaining, well written, well acted, and well filmed. It just behooves me as to why director David Ayers would opt to send the film in the direction that he did. But I will still recommend this film for viewing. I guess sometimes the bad guys have to win too I guess that's why it's called artistic license! Made for only $7 million dollars, this film is already paid for itself and more. I got to see this film on the big screen, and really enjoyed viewing it inside a movie theater, I recommend you doing so as well.

131,Simon_Says_Movies,Award-Worthy Stuff - One of the Best of Its Kind,8,23 September 2012,"From conflicts of duty and heart like Brooklyn's Finest to police morality tales such as the now-infamous Training Day over to classics like Serpico, no film to chronicle the day-to-day lives and misadventures of our men and women in blue has come off quite as authentic as End of Watch. Writer-director David Ayer (who is no stranger to the genre with titles Street Kings, S.W.A.T. and the aforementioned Denzel Washington thriller to his name) has honed in on everything that made his previous efforts a success while stripping away most of those elements that have now become cliché. That is not to say that End of Watch shatters new ground, or that the stripped-down procedural format hasn't been done in equally effective fashion (often more potently) in television series such as Southland and The Wire, but it would be grossly unfair to not give glowing credit where it is due. Thanks to the grippingly genuine performances from leads Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena, End of Watch is one of the best films of the year and absolutely one of the best of its kind across all possible subgenres. Dirty cop, undercover, gangster – you name it. At an aesthetic level, the use of up-close-and-personal shaky cam easily distinguishes Ayer's tale from other beat-cop chronicles (while somewhat inviting comparisons to the aforementioned Southland at the same time). It makes End of Watch feel much closer to the reality show Cops then to the likes of Narc or Cop Land. Likely not to make people as nauseated as other ""found footage"" fare, End of Watch only calls into attention its gimmick when addressing the fact that the cameras are there, e.g. ""turn that camera off, I'm doing this for a film class,"" etc. Simply employing the close-up feel and nothing more would have done End of Watch a number of favors. Bolstering the (positive) elements of that filmmaking choice even further is the grippingly faithful dialogue, which while not shying away from the code-laden jargon that accompanies the job, also provides impeccably easy-going (and often hilarious) exchanges that would make the likes of Aaron Sorkin or Quentin Tarantino proud. It is in this screen writing sense where Ayer has triumphed over his previous outings. Gyllenhaal and Pena aid in bringing the script to life and have such an easy-going rapport it is impossible not to be caught up with these two brothers in arms. Truthfully, it's all awards-worthy stuff. The plot is pretty cut and dry, but for End of Watch it stands as one of the film's greatest strengths. Spanning the course of about a year, officers Taylor and Zavala respond to domestic disputes, house fires and suspicious individuals. As they say, not everything is car chases and gunfights. Although they often think of themselves as cowboys (and South Central L.A. could be mistaken for the Wild West on more than one occasion), End of Watch isn't afraid to explore the family lives of these characters, the down times, and the casual, anecdotal exchanges that go along with the shoot-'em-up side of law. With his shaved head and confident swagger, Gyllenhaal slips effortlessly into his role as the young hotshot, rising to the occasion of the demanding off-handed dialogue, and without a doubt provides one of the best and most authentic performances of his already noteworthy career. Shattering all preconceived notions at what he was capable of, Pena is essentially a revelation, proving tough, funny and caring in equal measure, often at the same time. He seems to glean more charisma off of Gyllenhaal than other thesps with whom he's shared the screen. Supporting characters Anna Kendrick (as the love interest of Taylor), Natalie Martinez (charming and feisty as Zavala's wife) and all of the despicable street thugs who share the screen with our protagonists are also stellar, making for nothing close to a weak link. Gripping, tragic and utterly unafraid to go to gruesome places, End of Watch is a hugely pleasant surprise for a genre which has become all about the duality of crooked cops and surprise twist reveals that pluck an undercover cop out of thin air at the most opportune moment. There is something refreshing about having a film examine a clear-cut line of good and evil all while maintaining the ability to keep your sweaty hand firmly clasping the other.8.5/10playeraffinity.com",End of Watch
132,tbmforclasstsar,"a heart-pounding, found footage thriller that may be one of the best cop films ever",9,10 October 2012,"Found footage movies have really become a major genre in the present cinema world. What started off as an effective way to add some scares to a horror movie has now moved to superhero films (Chronicle) and cop films (End of Watch), as well as several other genres. And while making a found footage film always ends in some issues with who would be filming what we are seeing and how to shoot everything so it is logically found footage, these films can be extremely effective.This effectiveness is displayed in End of Watch.Starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena, End of Watch is the story of two police partners and their run ins with criminals, a dangerous cartel, and the lives they live together as brothers and with their own families. As Officers Taylor and Zavala, Gyllenhaal and Pena are the lifeblood of this film. Everything hinges on whether we can believe them to be friends and partners and whether their relationship appeals to us enough that we care for the trouble they end up in.Luckily, Gyllenhall and Pena are both brilliant in this film. And with dialog full of mocking jokes, pranks, and personal stories while they drive the streets of South Central LA and intense action shot right from the chest of each officer, both of their officer characters come to life in what is easily one of the most realistic and honest partner stories ever to be put on film.Officers Taylor and Zavala are very good at their jobs, but it comes with some dangerous territory. The opening scene of the film is a car chase that ends in both officers having to gun down the suspects they are chasing after shots are fired at them. This is not the first time either has been in great danger in their line of work, and it definitely won't be the last time.Part of the problem that comes from creating a found footage film with a cop film is that many of the action sequences call for frantic running and dark areas where it is hard to see what is going on. This could become painfully annoying with a movie made like this, but End of Watch does a fantastic job of making us aware of what is going on by switching camera angles, adding still cameras from cars and buildings, and giving us dialog between both officers that keeps us aware of what is happening. Now sure, there are many times when the footage on screen could not be from any of the characters or cameras that inhabit the world of the film, but we roll with it because the story is so intriguing, heart-pounding, and non-stop that we can't real waste time thinking who could be filming what we are seeing.To read the rest of the review (IMDb form too short) visit:http://custodianfilmcritic.com/end- of-watch/",End of Watch

134,caseymoviemania,Casey's Movie Mania: END OF WATCH (2012),6,18 November 2012,"From his breakthrough screenplay in 2001's TRAINING DAY to his both equally intense directing efforts in 2006's HARSH TIMES and 2008's STREET KINGS, writer-director David Ayer has a seemingly endless fascination with the gritty undertones of LAPD. And his trend of the familiar cop genre continues with his latest directing effort, END OF WATCH. At the first glance, the movie is more of the same gritty L.A.-set cop drama that we have seen many times before. But this time, it's a relief that Ayer doesn't exactly repeating himself too much. In END OF WATCH, he refashions the familiar cop genre with pseudo-documentary, found-footage style. Shooting a gritty cop movie in hand-held camera gives you that extra edge of you-are-there kind of feel, and END OF WATCH scores most of that point. Too bad, like any other David Ayer's movie (excluding TRAINING DAY), the movie doesn't capitalize its promising setup into a satisfying whole.The opening scene begins with Officer Brian Taylor's (Jake Gyllenhaal) voice-over who speaks about his inner thought working in the LAPD, before continues with a chase scene, filmed from the dashboard of a police car. (Think of it like the first five minutes in Kathryn Bigelow's STRANGE DAYS). The hot pursuit against a black Monte Carlo ends up with Taylor and his partner, Officer Mike Zavala (Michael Pena) gunned down a pair of armed criminals after they halted their assailant's vehicle. Their gung-ho way of doing their job earned them a reputation as ""ghetto gunslingers"" and both of them are full of bad-ass attitudes that their fellow colleagues don't particularly like them very much. Despite their reckless behaviors, both Brian and Mike are best buddies who treated each other like brothers.One day, during their ongoing beat, they have unexpectedly anger a group of high-level drug dealers and encounter some grisly activities revolves around a Mexican drug cartel. During off-hours, Brian has found a right girl named Janet (Anna Kendrick) and plans to settle down with her. Meanwhile, Mike is a loving family man where he and his wife Gabby (Natalie Martinez) are expecting their first child together.Ayer's stylistically gonzo filmmaking style is both inventive and gripping altogether (the POV scene is among the best), while the two actors -- Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena, are top-notch. They certainly brings a natural, yet believable chemistry together from the minute one. They are really enjoyable to watch for. Other supporting actors are equally ace, even for relatively small roles like Anna Kendrick who gives a sweet-natured performance as Janet. Newcomer Yahira 'Flakiss' Garcia, in the meantime, gives a frighteningly believable performance as the foul-mouthed and cold-hearted female gang member La La.The shootout scene, particularly the one in the violent finale where Brian and Mike find themselves stranded in the neighborhood without backup, is riveting.But for all the fancy aesthetics and top-notch cast, END OF WATCH remains a halfhearted effort. Beyond those gimmicks Ayer has to offer, his script is shopworn. Not only that, his script also tends to drag a lot with routine melodrama and there are times that Ayer gets overwhelmed with all the bromance between Brian and Mike.As flawed as it may be, END OF WATCH remains a fairly compelling effort to watch for.",End of Watch

They are young not veterans, and the characters are perfectly recited and framed by the two main actors.

And if we are to believe this is how cops work in the USA then they need to recruit some cops with higher IQs than these two. The stupid things they did - let alone ignoring the threat to their lives - just makes me think this film wasn't so much about how bad the bad guys are but more like how stupid the cops are.None of this cheaply made film makes any sense.

138,TheSeaLion,"Good premise and acting, but ultimately bogged down",5,1 October 2014,"""End of Watch"" is a police drama film written and directed by David Ayer, who has worked on a number of police-related movies in the past as either the writer, director, or both, including ""S.W.A.T"" and ""Street Kings"". The film stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena as two LAPD officers and focuses on their day-to-day work as police officers and their personal lives. The film does not seem to know what it is in its method of filming. There are numerous times when the scene is shown through a multitude of different cameras, but then there are scenes where the angle would be impossible for there to be a camera. A scene I will use as an example is when the gang members are in their car. One gang member has a camera and is filming them, which we see the scene unfold through. However, when a character talks to them and the camera shows the gang member holding the video camera, there are no cameras in the car that would have gotten that video. The point I am making is that the film jumps between found-footage and then regular filming at random points in scenes, which gets frustrating. The dialog in this movie has been praised by many, and while I can understand why so many people thought it was great, I thought at best it was mediocre. A lot of the street talk was cliché and stereotypical, as was the banter between the police officers, not Gyllenhaal and Pena, felt like it came from someone who didn't know how people joked around with one another. This is also one of only three movies, the other two being the 2005 ""Assault on Precinct 13"" and the recent movie ""Sex Tape"" where I have to complain about the swearing in the dialog. Now, I have no problem with swearing, but in this movie, I felt like it got worked into every other sentence because it was supposed to make the dialog feel more realistic. Now, to Ayer's credit, there are some scenes with very good use of dialog, especially at the funeral scene and the last scene of the movie. The single line used during the funeral said everything that needed to be said without going overboard, and the last scene of the movie felt like one person telling a funny story.One thing I will give credit for was the acting in this movie. Gyllenhaal and Pena had very good chemistry and worked off of each other well. Anna Kendrick also did a very good job. I'm actually surprised none of these actors were nominated for Academy Awards for their work in this movie.Even with the acting, though, the film is still bogged down with problems, deriving heavily from the camera work and dialog. The idea of following around two officers in their day-to-day lives including their police work and personal lives is an interesting idea, and I think it could be pulled off with a better script and less of the found- footage aspect of the camera work.",End of Watch

It plays almost like a police documentary as it captures the difficulty of the LA police officers role. It seems realistic and testing this is down to some excellent writing but more so to the fantastic acting. Its a very gritty drama, its heartfelt and convincing. I can't say it will be to everyones taste, I certainly feel its not one for a rewatch as its very blunt and energetic so much so that its so realistic that once is enough. I enjoyed it yet feel they made a mistake with the hand held camera, I understand that much of the realism was captured via this method but it is difficult to appreciate due to its shaky ness and almost amateurish nature.",End of Watch
142,SimonHeide,Curbside gang – Putos!,9,21 December 2012,"This movie contains a lot of elements that other movies have that deals with the theme of being a cop. It does excel in the finest way in the description of the hard job as front soldier in the ghetto of LA. The movie mainly consists of dialogue in the police car around the city and the various assignments that our protagonists respond to.The story isn't a revelation but the depiction is. Suspense and action with a strong blend of realism is where this flick stands out. Watching the movie I often had the feeling ""this is what it must be like to patrol on south side"". The radio transmission in the police car, the hand-held camera, the infrared light in several of the night scenes (reminds me of Danish ""dogme"" movie) and last but not least the gang members that Taylor and Zavala is up against are depicted with a lot of finesse. When Taylor and Zavala move in we see what they see. We understand what they understand and when they move on to the next bust we are often confused as to what happened to the victims etc. So there are several loose ends in this movie but they are used with the purpose of showing how the world really is perceived.A good example (spoiler); Taylor and Zavala moves into an abandoned house full of dead bodies. They all of a sudden see steam coming out of a kettle in the kitchen – somebody has just been here or might still be hiding. The suspense immediately builds up – but apparently with no reason since we don't find anybody there. Anti climax?. . No! Creepiness instead. Who was making coffee in a house full of rotten corpses? Your own twisted fantasy spiced up with a feeling of estrangement tries to give a description of that person. My respect to the director David Ayer for not falling for the temptation to let this scene end in a shoot-out.I saw this movie twice which is something very, very rare for me. I enjoyed it again and saw it as a strange blend between a documentary and an action movie.regards Simon",End of Watch

If that were true then I would be very worried about life in LA. the police are shown to be violent, stupid and inarticulate.it seems that the writers felt that the characters saying 'fack' (with a u) was to add realism. however, it is ridiculously over used. I counted 14 uses of the word in one two minute period ! perhaps they should have written a storyline instead and given the actors characters ? when I found myself wishing someone would use a different swearword to stop the boredom I stopped watching the film.avoid this film unless really like boring disjointed films without a proper storyline.",End of Watch

145,toddg-473-289818,gritty and pointless,4,25 August 2013,"I had high expectations for this movie, and was severely let down. The letdown came from a number of small things rather than one big one. While I accepted the story line of tough inner city cops working tough neighborhoods, I found the use of hand-held cameras to show uncommon angles to be an unnecessary distraction. So was the constant referencing of Anna Kendrick's cleavage in almost every shot she was in.But the biggest letdown in this movie was the generic nature of the battle between law enforcement and the human traffickers they fought against. The coyote types were one dimensional characters only - cold and angry all the time. We never really are told why they hate the police so much, other than that the police are obstacles to their business. But the human element was missing.The other letdown was the portrayal of the disconnect between the LAPD, a local agency, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a federal agency. We aren't given enough content about their lack of information sharing, and the plot too easily glosses over ICE's not sharing potentially life saving information with the LAPD.The one bright spot in the movie was the acting by Jake Gyllenhaal. He was very convincing as a hard charging, bend-the-rules street cop.

To have a baby with your wife, other than with your neighbor's is way too normal.What am I trying to indicate here?..
Let me try some more...Taylor is close friends with his partner Zavala. They get along pretty nicely.
Their becoming close friends is inevitable with respect to sociology, can we say?..So, their being from different races would not ""necessarily"" interfere with their friendship nor work. Okay, culture tends to run the streets all around the world. That means Michael Jackson's taught to become whiter in order to be better, and a man's taught to have an ""unjustifiable"" affair with his neighbor's wife after seeing pious people become obsessed over the soap operas on TV. To flout is another deed of a human being, right?..We are being taught inequality in every possible way, for peace is cheaper to the reapers of the world...The scenario is mediocre and somewhat darker than enough. Okay, this life may get dark...

Reviews should have been begging people to spend their money on this one, so more quality films like this can be made. In my humble, unasked-for opinion, this was quality.Every now and then, Hollywood does something like this, and just surprises me. It's well written, well acted, VERY well directed, very well paced, and VERY hard to watch. It's rated R for a reason.How I missed this one for so long is beyond me, because it should be water-cooler buzz and high on anyone's list who can handle very gritty, realistic crime dramas. It's bloody, laced with foul language and shot half the time with a camera angle that seems too close to be real. But it has an art all of it's own.I'm not a big fan of anybody in it, but they were all excellent. It really seemed like they were sharing their life with you, not just running through lines.

The leading ladies were funny and added to the character development really well as did the other funny police officers in the film.The hand-held camera thing was totally unnecessary and why on earth the gangsters had a hand-held camera for their criminal activity, well...erm...nope...drawing a total blank!!

The end of watch is more than a story of two beat cops in south L.A., it's a look inside the brotherhood of the men and women who wear the blue. When watching this movie I was at times reminded of the TV series ""The wire"", anytime we can get an authentic look into the lives of police officers who patrol a beat, the insight and realism will give you a renewed view of those who wear the blue.I wasn't a big fan of the camera work with this movie, almost the entire movie was shot through the idea of either the good guys or the bad guys holding hand held cameras. While this may give the viewer a sense of realism, the end result was a dizzy effect at times, and too many dis-jointed scenes that traditional camera work would of been more effective.Finally the storyline while not anything new was compelling and engaging.

150,rhefner2002,Rises above the usual genre,7,6 October 2019,"Nearly Shakespearean in its depth of characterization and tragedy, _End of Watch_ proves a point: A genre flick doesn't have to be just ""more of the same.""Having recently watched the over-the-top and silly _Training Day_ (which was written by the writer / director of this film, David Ayer), I was about ready to give up on cop movies. But this one garnered enough critical praise that I gave it chance.I'm glad I did. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena are endearing as cop partners who are also best buddies, to the point where they attend each other's family affairs and their wives are close friends. They're also straight cops and good guys, a refreshing change from the seemingly inexhaustible stream of ""bad cop"" movies that Hollywood cranks out.This film has a simple plot, but it's so strong on characterization that you might need a couple of tissues at the end (no spoilers here!), especially during the very clever flashback in the last scene.End of Watch is not perfect. Almost every stop these cops make turns into a major bust: drugs, weapons, human trafficking. Yes, south central L.A. is crime-ridden, but these guys hit the jackpot so many times, it's hard to believe.The shaky, hand held camera work is unnecessary. The gimmick is that Gyllenhaal is video freak, so he always has a camera with him. Plus, the two cops are always wearing body cams. Much of the movie is supposedly shot from these two perspectives, but it's also shot with regular movie cameras. The effect becomes annoying. Thankfully, in the most significant scenes, we get a steady camera.The repeated use of the ""F"" word, often a dozen times in a couple of sentences, becomes overwhelming. It gets to the point where it's just overdone. I suppose Ayer was going for realism. But I don't hang out with L.A. cops or Mexican gang, so what do I know about their speech?Minor gripes aside, a film about good cops trying to do the right thing in life-threatening jobs is welcome. And it also reminds us, as Gyllenhaal tells us in the initial soundtrack narrative, that cops are human beings with hearts, loved ones, and feelings.A memorable film, probably one of the best of 2012.

I've watched Argo, Savages, Killing Them Softly to name a few half decent flicks. End of Watch succeeds mostly due to its strong focus on character development, which it does beautifully! Unfortunately, the tagline/summary for the movie on IMDb gave away waaay too much. The trailer seemed to do the same thing. It was a great sign of excessive marketing. The plot indicated in the summary of the movie more-so becomes relevant towards the very end of the movie. Almost like a spoiler. End of Watch is not a movie about two cops being marked for death whilst doing their job; rather it is a movie about friendship, love and family depicted from the perspective of two cops in the dark, gritty suburbs of Los Angeles. There are 3 main reasons why End of Watch scores very highly in my books:A) The chemistry between the two leads is remarkable!B) The movie is very realistic. It's slow, dark and gritty. It doesn't give action for mere entertainment, but rather when it is required. Don't let the trailers make you believe this is an action flick; it is very very far from an action flick.C) The first person perspective with the use of the camera adds an immense amount of realism such that you actually feel like you are/become the cops in the movie. This movie is a study of good characters living in a very bad world and the inherent consequences that follow.",End of Watch
152,DubhDoo,The best cop movie in years,7,2 May 2013,"There have been countless cop movies that have portrayed police officers as tough-as-nails mavericks that use their badge to their advantage. Although great, 'Dirty Harry' and 'The French Connection' spring to mind as prime examples of this, which is why 'End of Watch' is such a breath of fresh air in the cop genre. It simply portrays its police officers as relatable guys who want to do their job to the best of their ability, even if that means dangerously rushing into a burning building. It feels authentic and gives the viewer a realistic-seeming insight into the lives of two LAPD officers. This is emphasised by the hit-and-miss use of the found footage technique; when documenting the day-to-day lives of Officers Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Zavala (Peña) it is at its best and rarely distracting; it naturalistically depicts their casual banter that is both funny and realistic, whilst also portraying the violent horrors they can stumble across on the job to arresting effect. However, when being used by the cardboard-cut-out antagonists its purpose of being feels somewhat contrived and a tad pointless, as the reasons for its use appear flimsy.What elevates 'End of Watch' above most other cop films is the affecting friendship between Taylor and Zavala that gives the movie its beating and very human heart. The dynamic may be clichéd – hot- tempered prankster and sensible family man – but their relationship is a thing of real brilliance nonetheless, which is quite a feat when you consider the lack of warmth Gyllenhaal and Peña felt towards each other on set. Both deliver some of their strongest performances yet, possessing fantastic chemistry together.'End of Watch' sees 'Training Day' writer David Ayer markedly step- up his game after the considerably humdrum 'Street Kings' in 2008. It's not perfect; its most notable misstep is its villains whose vocabulary solely consists of yelling, profanity and both. They are every bit as archetypal and stereotypical as they come, but they do little to take from the overall quality of Ayer's latest film as director, as despite their one-dimensionality you still don't want them to hurt Zavala or Taylor. Aided by a realistic feel, this is cop movie with great direction, two terrific central performances and real heart, without ever being cheesy. It may not be ""the greatest cop movie ever"" as William Friedkin professed, but as I'm concerned, this is the best cop movie in quite some time.",End of Watch
153,jcallows,dull,6,14 February 2013,"This is yet another film that uses the shaky-cam gimmick to add realism. This film is shot documentary style and has us assume that it's been pieced together from video footage captured by several characters in the film themselves. Unfortunately, it suffers the same problems other films have when shot this way. There are numerous times when I wonder, ""Now, who's holding the camera this time?"" Also, it's extremely hard to believe cops would be willing to enter a gang-infested neighborhood holding a camera in one hand and a gun in the other. It's these questions that, ironically, make this film less realistic.The gimmicky shaky-cam style and unrealistic moments aside, this film is simply dull. There are a few suspenseful moments, but most don't lead to anything. The story is unoriginal, which is disappointing, for a film that appears to try to be original with its documentary-style story telling. The lone bright spot are the characters. They are definitely likable, but unfortunately, they aren't enough to save this film.",End of Watch

One very interesting point that is made is about the diversity of the neighborhoods. And for someone who remembers that area in the 90's, that part rang very true.Oh yeah, I loved The Wire also.

158,octopusluke,"An authentic, brawny portrayal of bromance on the thin blue line.",7,22 November 2012,"A quick glance at filmmaker David Ayer's curriculum vitae would lead you to believe that he's not a fan of American law enforcement. In a just over ten years, he's written and/or directed five police corruption movies – from the Academy Award winning Training Day, to 2008′s formulaic cop romp Street Kings. His latest, End of Watch sees Ayer sticking to his guns with another revelatory tale of LAPD activity; only instead of the familiar ""cop with a vengeance"" yarn, he presents a refreshingly mercurial tale of two honest cops trying to keep the mean streets of Los Angeles clean through totally lawful, by-the-book means. Sounds boring, right? I thought so too. Two days after the film, I'm still eating my words.Jake Gyllenhaal stars as ex-marine turned competent cop Brian Taylor. Along with his working partner and best friend Mike Zavala (Michael Peña), the pair patrol the streets of Los Angeles closing down raucous house parties, stopping the Mexican drug cartel and, on the odd occasion, breaking into a human trafficking den filled with thirty or so beaten up immigrants seeking exile. Whilst out on their various quests, the pair idly chit-chat about their home life, relationship troubles and the latest ethnic stereotype joke. It's all done in good humour, and we quickly learn that their friendship is based on far more than just a mutual affinity for catching the bad guys.What End of Watch lacks in narrative drive, it makes up for with an interesting stylistic edge. The movie resorts to an unique melange of hand-held camera technique (Paul Greengrass' Bourne films sprung to mind), 'day in the life' documentary and reality TV, a la COPS. Thankfully, the first person camera work is brought into the story directly with Brian documenting his day-to-day working life for a part-time filmmaking class. It's a far-fetched premise (and surely against some kind of police discretion policy), but the shrewdness of Ayer's script makes you sink straight in to the visual onslaught.For the first hour, it is some of the best, most transcendental cop-drama stuff I've ever seen. Gyllenhaal and Peña are overwhelmingly impressive in the lead roles, with the sort of natural chemistry that makes them film's most affable law enforcer duo since Lethal Weapon. I could even tolerate the excessive side plot about Brian's blossoming romance with local law-school girl Janet (Anna Kendrick). But, as the film runs to it's close, Ayer works tirelessly to form a conventional storyline thread – which it didn't need – that it ends up impinging on the ballsy filming technique. We learn that the Mexican cartel on the hunt for the two cops are also filming their own, incriminating activity on a hand-held camera. Why? Are they in the same film class as Brian? If the universally inept acting technique is anything to go by, the answer is evidently no, but just like the cop-out final sequence, the boundaries of normal logic don't seem to fit into this otherwise authentic portrayal of bromance on the thin blue line.Read more reviews at www.366movies.com",End of Watch

Mostly just annoying. The Blair witch project did this much better, although it was a stupid conceit there too, especially when a ""third"" camera suddenly made its appearance..........""NOOOOOOOOO!"" the humanity.

The real violence in the drug war is occurring south of the border, using US weapons, 40,000 dead in the last 6-8 years or so.

161,DrewAlexanderR1,The Counterpart to Training Day,8,27 July 2015,"The writer of Training Day, David Ayer, pens this script and takes the helm as director. The film follows the story of two young police partners who patrol the streets of LA. It is shot in documentary style with a hand cam present in the narrative. The two officers, Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Peña), put themselves into crime that goes deeper than what the average cop should be dealing with. It is a fast paced film with a lot of action. The plot is well developed and the dialogue is expertly written. This film comes from the mind behind Training Day and it is a good counterpart in relation to showing the good side of cops who are trying their best to protect and serve. This film isn't as good as Training Day, but it comes close. The story escalates and shows the dangerous side of the lives that cops lead. Brian and Mike's wives Janet (Anna Kendrick) and Gabby (Natalie Martinez) do a great job showing the family side of this. End of Watch has a lot to offer.

The found footage technique is used sporadically through the film, and I found this distracting. The director picked up the method and set it back down again. I think the movie would have been better if the found footage had been deep sixed. The dynamic camera work could have been just that without trying to explain the unsteady, quick takes. It would have just been artistic. The found footage ends up being just a contrivance.I thought some the scenes were over the top and unbelievable with some of the bad guys coming close to caricatures. The director, in his commentary, claims that everything that happened in the movie has happened in real life. That claim is made based on his experiences and contacts within the LAPD. I'll accept that claim as true; I have no reason not too. That said, LA is a very scary place.One other part of the movie bothered me a bit. A scene involving a very angry and very large thug ends with some very strange reactions from the cops involved. Their reactions made them either unbelievable or unlikable--you can judge.The things I didn't like were far outnumbered by the things that I liked. I think you'll find End of Watch to be a gritty and engrossing film.",End of Watch
163,aequus314,"It moves with rapid fire momentum; letting off at the right junctures, allowing an arresting finale to hammer in",8,11 February 2013,"I would imagine End of Watch as the kind of action thriller that appeals to a younger demographic — it moves with rapid fire momentum; letting off at the right junctures, allowing an arresting finale to hammer in.Jake Gyllenhaal is former US Marine Brian Taylor and Michael Peña is Mike Zavala — both are foul-mouthed and mischievous small-time officers of the LAPD patrolling South Central Los Angeles. Tasked to submit a film project for his art elective in Uni, Brian documents work on the go with nifty little spy cameras that will put investigative journalists to shame. His partner and buddy is Mike, a Mexican notorious for hilarious commentary on all types of clichés and stereotypes too juicy to describe in this review.What makes this film exhilarating material as well, is urgent development of two likable characters through sparks of ingenious incidents. As Brian and Mike patrol the ghettos; they survive thumping dangers that range from breaking out domestic fights, sparring hot- headed homies, to rescuing children trapped in burning houses. As banal and trite as these dramatic encounters may sound, writer-director David Ayer (Street Kings, Harsh Times) evens out the effect with contemporary (and politically incorrect) narratives. The most important vibe being released, is that of a sense that these crime fighters are getting by with natural smarts, some muscle and sheer blind luck — they scrape by in the game perhaps, by chance — one fine day, being brazen and impulsive might do them in.Looming threat on the horizon is a Mexican street gang connected to Sinaloa Cartel, an organized crime syndicate with operations Brian and Mike thwarted in a premeditated raid on one of their hideouts. A hit is thus ordered on their heads; while nefarious baddies plot to outsmart and assassinate them, we venture deeper into the pair's private and emotional lives.End of Watch works by virtue of witty dialog, good rapport between the actors and a highly entertaining premise. Cinematographer Roman Vasyanov captures the hot; salty air of life, movement and violence in the streets of LA. While editor Dody Dorn cuts between documentary, surveillance and actual film footage with a keen sense of kinetic precision without ever losing sight of continuity—this, is no easy feat. Ayer himself; has a sharp ear for rhythm in the vein of Tarantino, capturing torrents of expletives that snaps and pops nicely like a spontaneous rap battle between the two leads. This is crucial in justifying found-footage technique — a pair of theatrical wisecracks hamming it up for the camera — further put to brilliant use in enhancing intense, sweaty, claustrophobic scenes.Apart from modern context based on a generation fixated with social media and blog TV; End of Watch works on the strength of two factors: a sturdy action-driven plot; and a completely believable human complex of reckless idealism, vanity, pure courage and camaraderie.

165,diomavro,Good initial setup but some plot issues,7,4 December 2014,"Overall I really enjoyed the movieCharacters: I found all the acting and characters in this movie to be all around great. Camera work: This kind of shooting is always a little high risk but somehow this movie does it well for the most part. I feel like a little more consistency on where the camera is would have been nice. The realism in the way some of the shots are only make it that much more unrealistic when we see shots which are obviously not taken from the personal cam perspective, which sometimes ruins the continuity. It might have made things a little more difficult to convey but it would be worth it from an immersion point of view. For instance the ending scene would have been great if it was caught from the cops point of view. Plot issues: I felt like we didn't need to see the scene where the hit is placed on the cops, especially since we hear them being warned like 5 minutes later(from the personal cam), just a little bit more emphasis on it would have been enough. I have a little bit of an issue with their actions in the ambush, I don't understand why they didn't just leave through the apartment door, which would give them much more time to escape and instead they went straight through the balcony in plain view bullet-less, if the guy who ambushed them really had any idea about guns he would have heard the guns being out of ammo and lifted his head up and shot them. Also when they got out of the building, they were like jogging/walking in plain sight, absolutely ridiculous, you either run as fast as you can or take cover, there were a bunch of fences they could have jumped over to hide under instead they decide to walk down the most obvious way possible. These kind of errors destroyed any form of realism for me.Overall I thought this was a little bit below Training Day but anyone who enjoyed that should also enjoy this.",End of Watch

This time is no different, as the plot centers around two LAPD cops.However, the approach in this movie feels fresh, as this is a mix of a realistic cop movie and a found footage movie. This makes the film feel more documentary than usual, almost like an episode of ""Cops"". This works well, and as a viewer I am quickly immersed into the action.Casting too well-known names in this kind of movie can easily ruin the documentary feeling, but I don't feel that's the case here. Acting performances are strong and believable throughout, main leads Pena and Gyllenhaal have great chemistry, and rising star Anna Kendrick adds another impressive performance to her CV.The movie also really gets to me, and I think it scares me in some ways. Earlier movies about south central LA, for example Boyz n the hood, usually centers around minor-level drug dealers and their brutal ways of dealing with one another, but in this movie the Mexican cartels use an almost extreme level of violence and that unsettles me a bit.Overall, a great cop movie with a really good cast and storyline, watch it!",End of Watch

I kinda remembered parts of but I kept procrastinating watching it again now because I loved it a few years ago. So finally came the day I finally decided to watch it and I must say even after all these years it's quite enjoyable.I want to talk about a few aspects of the movie.The story. ( Easy to watch, engaging.
It's set in the not so beautiful part of Los Angeles where we are following around the daily lives and struggles of two police officers in an action/crime packed movie which is shot in this interesting documentary, movie-style which was done extremely right. It's a happy/sad story which takes you on a ride through Los Angeles criminal underground. It's a story about friendship and loyalty until the end. An up-close and personal story about being at the wrong place at the wrong time while pushing your luck.
Personally, this is one of my favourite examples of how to make a good action movie. It doesn't work every time but it worked this time.Sound design - (Not the greatest but everything music-wise felt right like you would expect.)Cinematography (Feels like they thought about everything and it has that dark and happy/scary vibe to everything from which you can never really predict what's about to happen when you are watching it for the first time. I loved how it showed people from different perspectives and how someone's actions affected other people and them in the future.)Overall I think quite a lot of people will enjoy it and very few won't. Personally, after watching it this feels like not the greatest movie and not the worst one so it's somewhere in the middle around 8 out of 10.
Would recommend to anyone and it would be one of my first choices.",End of Watch

It resembles 'Training Day' but makes it pale in comparison. We are finally meeting a LAPD department where no rotten types and double snitches are inside the force. It's the good guys (black-and-white cops) v. the bad ass vermin, drug, heroin and human trafficking types who torture people to death. In End of Watch Brian and Mike are not witness to, but are only confronted with remnants of that evil , when daylight is falling upon physical evidence. The rookie cops are doing a great job and are gradually taking back the south central neighborhood, by making some great scores. Only when some Mexican drug lord has had enough of the two young rookies, ruining his business and killing secret storage and torture hideouts, evil rises to unexpected levels, unforeseen by the LAPD. The end credits finish with : ""This film is dedicated to the men and women of the Law Enforcement Community who face danger daily on our behalf. It is especially dedicated to our fallen heroes who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. This is for all that fight evil so we may not know it. God bless you all.""

Credit also has be given to the director as the Gun fights, and action scenes were shot in such a way that you did feel the intensity and pressure the characters would be feeling.The one big problem with the film, and i mean BIG problem. Is the awful decision to do the film in a found footage style. As there are many inexplicable moments at some inappropriate times, where it switch to a conventionally shot style.

175,thefilmdiscussion,"""End of Watch"" is gritty and heartfelt",8,25 September 2012,"David Ayer's latest cop-drama is gritty, violent and full of perfect moments of flawlessly recreated reality. ""End of Watch"" is told through a combination of first person video captured by Officer Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) for his film class, as well as traditional methods, resulting in a refreshingly vibrant mix of styles and storytelling. We watch Officers Taylor and Zavala (Michael Pena), the ultimate buddy cops, as they drive around what may be the most dangerous beat in America: Los Angeles' South Central. After an exciting opening shootout they get perhaps a bit full of themselves and investigate a house they might shouldn't have investigated. The horrors they uncover expose a large drug cartel who then sets their sights on the two officers, throwing the usual ""don't kill cops"" rule to the wind in pursuit of preserving their business. Led by a man known as Big Evil (because his ""evil is big""), the cartel sets up a riveting last act that pits the two resourceful cops in an all-out war with the whole gang of fully- automatic-toting baddies. In between we get insightful glimpses at the lives behind these two brave badges and the women who pray for them to come home (Natalie Martinez and Anna Kendrick). ""End of Watch"" is another realistic cop-drama from the writer of ""Training Day"" that brims with emotion and violence.

177,jbathie,A very different view of law enforcement,9,14 March 2021,"I've seen this movie 4 times. I love it, it's what I would imagine what law enforcement life would be like in 70's and 80's LA. Gangs were plentiful, drugs were everywhere, and police weren't under the microscope of smartphones and surveillance cameras like they are now.Life was different, not only for police, but for criminals, and those who lived near them too. Drive-by shootings were becoming the way gangs and even the mafia responded to their enemies. High powered semi-automatic and even fully automatic weapons were used to dispatch their level of justice to their enemies.However, I don't just know firearms from watching movies. I served, and had the opportunity to use the hand guns, semi-automatic, and fully-automatic weapons just like are used in this movie.Not long after the movie starts there's a drive-by, and the shooters are using fully-automatic AK-47's, one of the most deadly automatic weapons in the world. The AK was first produced in 1948 firing a 7.62mm round (.308), and incredibly reliable, and accurate.However, 2 shooters from less than 50' away firing at 715m/s at a rate of 10 rounds per second could only hit 1 person in a cluster of bodies.[ In addition to that another shooter was firing a 45 semi-auto at them.Sure, these are untrained shooters who likely have only fired weapons like this once or twice, but seriously? Only 1 person in a cluster of 5 people standing 2 feet from each other? Is the message the director is sending one of ""we didn't want a lot of bodies"", or ""we assume they don't know how to shoot'?Directors and editors need to do a better job than this when producing movies. People who watch them know things they don't, so hire a consultant from the police, and even someone who used to bang. Bring them on set and advise on the incidents and even script so the product you produce is real, or as close to real as you can make it.My review of this? Great flick. Great action and wonderful twist on how it's filmed. I really enjoyed the story, the actors, and the flow. Good job, but there are easy fixes to annoying things.

Supporting cast was weak, with no standout performances.Understandably unrealistic in certain contexts. The daily job of a street cop is dominated by non-violent, relatively tame circumstances (think fender benders and traffic citations), and lots of paperwork. The movie does a couple of things to try to distance the main characters from that grind. They are portrayed as thrill-seekers, and the movie uses large time lapses in real time to move the story along to the more exciting things that might happen in a cop's daily grind.Where you've got to really take a leap of faith is the bigger picture crime depiction: A federal law enforcement operation that would knowingly allow human trafficking and wanton murder, including young children, in the middle of a Los Angeles ghetto, as part of some larger investigation of a cartel, complete with mysterious federal officers who can't discuss the matter with city cops.

There was some insanely good chemistry between Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña who both pulled off their best performances to date. The banter between these two in the police car was absolutely hilarious, I could really watch an entire movie's worth of this stuff. The long form dialogue about their lives was really interesting and it felt amazingly natural. This is then contrasted with their jobs which puts them into really dangerous circumstances. Usually cop movies are about cops and criminals and how they're really just two sides of the same coin. In End of Watch the cops are really just the good guys and the tension is between their work and their private lives and whether they can keep them separate. I was really emotionally invested in these characters and the film does a terrific job in building up suspense.I thought the filming style worked really well here. Hand-held and cell phone cameras are tied in to the story nicely. Some might complain about the bad guys carrying the cameras but aren't Mexican cartels kind of famous for the fact that they film their crimes? I don't know, it worked for me though. The action sequences were nail-bitingly great, you really feel like you're right in there. The action is really gritty and doesn't hold back.

And Jake Gyllenhall's buzz cut does his misshapen head no service. The blathering, dull, Tarantinoesque dialogue is every bit as stupid and nauseatingly idiotic as it is in all of Tarantino's movies. Do the writer, filmmaker and actors really think sexually explicit, high school locker room trash talk is clever? Any fifteen-year-old boy could write this junk. And only a fifteen-year-old boy would find it entertaining.My favorite character was the female gang member who did all their driving and tried to act like she was such a tough, killer gangster. Obviously she was just a scared little girl with daddy issues, but the profane, threatening and boastful running of her big mouth was really funny. It certainly failed to have the effect she and the filmmakers intended. A real person like her would benefit from getting punched in her big mouth just once (and not by one of those scrawny little male gang members but by a large, angry guy) and she'll settle down and take up more-appropriate pursuits.All in all, this movie just sucked. It portrays cops in a terrible light. If it's as accurate as I have been told it is by LA cops I have known, it's no surprise they've had the problems they've endured.

I find it far from that. Too much for two guys to see on duty in such a short time. Some scenes appear a bit over the top. Also, the attitude these guys have is a bit cocky/immature. True there are cops like this but the way they act almost stereotypes cops in that manner. The Mexican gangbangers were a bit overacting especially the female driving the car. Lots of F bombs that probably could have reduced the dialogue a bit if some of them were taken out. I actually find the show Southland to be more real and entertaining.",End of Watch
190,BecksyKane,A suspenseful cop-flick with heart behind it,8,13 May 2020,"Shot documentary-style, using a mixture of body cams, dash cams and camcorders - parts of the film almost feel like you are on a simulation ride (particularly during the opening scene). The body cam/camcorder shots were really effective during the scenes where the officers stumble upon rather gruesome finds, purely because we witness their reactions in real-time. Although it's an unusual style of film-making, it worked very well and it really felt like you were sitting in on a ride-along.Gyllenhaal and Peña's on screen bromance is the driving force behind this film. The dash cam footage inside the patrol car really allows the audience to be a fly on the wall as we see their relationship close up - from late night heart to hearts, to teasing and laughing with one another.This is a really enjoyable film, which deserves much more recognition than it gets (especially since it was filmed in only 22 days). I really liked that it was relatively simple - no big stunts, special effects or visuals, just a great plot and believable acting. Theres plenty of action, gripping moments and perhaps a wee sniffle (who knows). My only grievance is that the ending is rather lack-lustre in comparison to the rest of the film.",End of Watch

Sexy, funny, sad, perverse, dangerous, loving, laughing, caring, dying and living. Oops I forgot - exciting, really intelligent contemporary film-making. Oh dear must be 10 lines of text so I'll tell a boring story. Sunday morning when everyone is bleary eyed, stretching, making love or I suppose going to church, shopping or discussing their latte preferences I chose to go to a local mall to see 'End of Watch' 9am session. Lucky day - had a free ticket. A seat is allocated. Inside the theatre it is totally empty. Take your pick. I'm alone in the theatre when a very small person arrives, in the dark trying make out his ticket allocation. Remember this is a large empty theatre.

And honestly it almost felt that way. I agree with another one of the reviews that brings out the strong chemistry of Michael Pena and Jake Gylenhaal. Their chemistry is outstanding. One can only think they must be pretty good friends outside of this film. These two guys really care about each other and give each other a hard time. It's so much fun to watch these two act like brothers. Aside from this great chemistry the film is rather unflinching in it's depiction of life on the force in south L.A. Obviously it isn't the first film to do so but it still feels fresh with it's combination of point of view cameras and traditional views. Also I like the use of ""surveillance"" footage and night vision footage to mix things up. While you know that these various types are being used to add realism they still don't lose their effect in making you feel like you're there observing the action whether it's from the cop's perspective or the criminal's. I honestly didn't expect much but this film was truly thrilling, entertaining, and moving to a degree. I wrote the title I did because I felt it was the same excellent character driven film like Training Day (and written by the same guy of course) but instead this is about two people who love each other as opposed to two people who hate each other. Outside of that it's rather similar when it comes to a series of scenarios that lead up to a finale. I also like the unflinching not so happy ending in this film. I am a bit jaded and I felt like I expected it to one degree or another but at the same point I still felt like it kept the story real and more relatable. All and all a solid cop film that provides both the story and thrills to satisfy all audiences. Kudos David Ayer, kudos.",End of Watch

195,thedudeabides-2,Slow to start but soon picks up,8,31 July 2014,"After the success of The Blair Witch Project, the found footage genre took off considerably, with many poor imitators cropping up. Paranormal Activity only added fuel to the trend but it still stayed within the horror genre. Enter End Of Watch; a found footage cop thriller starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Micheal Pena as two inexperienced cops patrolling the gang infested streets of L.A.The plot is rather thin on the ground, as Gyllenhaal and Pena find out that they have upset a local gang leader and must watch their backs to avoid an early demise. It is a lot more exciting than it sounds, mainly due to the found footage style which offers some incredibly nail biting sequences, the most affecting of which involves the cops searching an abandoned drug den only to make an even more shocking discovery.The almost constant use of hand-held camera is a little disorienting at first but, as you get used to the erratic camera movements, you will find yourself getting more and more embroiled in the plight of the cops. The style lends the film an intensity that simply would not have been possible if director David Ayers had employed a more traditional approach but it does throw up some logistical questions, like why a criminal gang would decide to film all of their nefarious acts.Ayers also plays a little loose with the style, sometimes choosing to forego the hand-held style in favour of a more stylistic shot. It doesn't ruin the movie but it can be a little jarring to switch from hand-held to staged and back to hand-held. Thankfully, these instances are fairly rare, with the majority of the movie leaving you feeling breathless as you are put in the shoes of a cop in gangland L.A. Ayers wisely chooses to include a number of quieter character moments, in which we get to know the characters and what makes them tick and Gyllenhaal and Pena share wonderful on screen chemistry which only makes it harder to watch when the action eventually takes off.A little bit of a slow starter, but once it gets going, End of Watch will have you gripping the edge of your seat until the jaw dropping finale.",End of Watch

It's all about two cops who are going after drug dealers and because they didn't have enough experience get hurt by the end. Absolutely boring. I don't remember any dialog that is worth while. Acting was average because of the shallow script. Directing was terrible. It's like cop Blair Witch Project with that shaky cam and we've already seen this kind of directing in so many movies before. If you expected to see a good cop movie like Colors, Training Day, Narc, Harsh Times etc. you will be disappointed.

The cops appeared as near to real-life as I'd imagine things get in LA and the baddies were as bad as Hollywood will depict them?! In fact, the female 'baddie' was portrayed as being nastier than the Mr Evil (the baddest and meanest of the 'bad' male characters), intentionally cast so as to let us know that females can be meaner and nastier than males in some 'gang' instances - no doubt?A particularly violent climax does leave you wondering how anybody can survive the unloading of so many rounds from high capacity magazines?Tarrantino will come along with his exploding blood bags and take us to the next level of realism I've no doubt, if he can sell himself on the concept of yet another LA cop drama!",End of Watch

But that's no reason not to check it out.""End Of Watch"" is a buddy-cop movie, set in South Central LA. One major element that might require an effort to accept is the visual style. The film adopts the ""real-life footage"" style, mixed with normal viewpoints. The cheap cinematography is worth accepting and embracing, it really fits with the atmosphere.While the story is not very complex and there are obvious hints of where it all leads to, I was never bored or fully aware of the third act.The best thing about the movie are the two main characters. The chemistry between them is so organic, humorous and credible. I'm sure Pena and Jake stayed friends after shooting this movie.There is profanity and violence throughout, but it's not really glamorizing any of it.

As expected, I was completely swept in the seemingly typical yet compelling story riddled with not-so-typical camera work - impressively evoking more than just crafty tension.'End of Watch' undoubtedly establishes its style within the first few minutes, and continues to embrace it in a cleverly subtle way throughout the whole film. The naturally elaborate chemistry between Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña feels almost unmatchable, maintaining its genuine and energetic tone despite the occasional drift to mundane dialogue. In fact, the dialogue surrounding the heartless group of blatant criminals feels too repetitive for the most part, however, whether that's realistic or purposely exaggerated to essentially expose heartless human beings is not for me to judge.All in all, David Ayer proves himself as a competent film-maker in this urban setting - creating a unique and memorable cop drama by combining supposedly juxtaposing elements which just work, and often help to provide a greater emotional hit. Apart from a few hiccups, 'End of Watch' expresses pride, respect and more importantly loyalty in its sentimental boldness... all the while providing great action sequences that'll keep you on the edge of your seat.",End of Watch
206,theblacksuit3,The best buddy cop movie I've seen in a while,9,30 September 2012,"***MEGA SPOILERS AHEAD*** This movie is truly a landmark in history, just for its raw force. It's hilarious, suspenseful, and truly tormenting. It's filmed mostly from Brian Taylor's (Jake Gyllenhaal) camera that he's using for a film project, as well as the dash cam in their car. The way they talk to each other is hilarious and true. My best friend and myself are the same way. But it also gets intense by involving you in all the action. This movie is really a better bromance since Sherlock Holmes (2009.) The part that sticks in my mind however is the ending, essentially the last 20 minutes. They build up the suspense when the cops are tricked into the apartment complex, and when they bust out and run down the isolated alley with dogs barking at them on both sides, not knowing where the cartel are puts you on edge more than any horror movie could possibly even attempt. I personally felt a bit cheated when Zavala dies, and feel it would have been a bit more impacting if they both died together. However I do feel that the last scene where they were in the car talking again was perfect since it showed a last testament to their friendship, and shows how much your day can change in just a few hours. You can go from joking around with your best friend and laughing and having a good time, to running for your life with nothing except a hand gun and your best friend to survive with. A definite must for anyone who wants a good realistic and emotional movie.",End of Watch
207,meaningbird,The Ultimate Buddy Cop Movie,10,20 September 2020,"So I just watched End of Watch and it is by far Ayer's best movie. The acting is incredible, everyone does a great job especially Jake Gyllenhaal who does incredible. He's probably my favorite actor. I've never seen him give a bad performance. The characters are also great, especially our main two Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Peña) who have great on-screen chemistry and are very funny in this movie. The action is so great it is done so well it feels gritty it feels like people could die at any moment and it is very violent. The way this film is filmed whether we're talking about the found footage parts or the not found footage parts work they work very well and made the movie better in my opinion helping with the grittiness. Like most things in this movie the ending is incredible. I really liked it.
I hope David Ayer goes back to making films as good as this because he's able to do it and from what I've heard I doubt The Tax Collector will be that return but I hope he starts making great films soon.
Overall this is probably my 2nd favorite movie of 2012 (I think I like Moonrise Kingdom a bit more) and this is probably my favorite found footage type film and I'm going to give End of Watch an A+",End of Watch
208,a-ozornin,Not what cops deserve,6,26 September 2012,"The trailer to the film was very promising: one could not tell from those couple of minutes as to what was going to happen in the film, or what the film is about. It all looked just tense, bloody and sweaty ode to policemen – something to look forward to. The problem is that even after watching the movie I cannot tell what the film is about, or why on earth it appeared in the way it did.The whole movie is done in the mockumentary style: at the very start the main character flashes the camera that he has, and then most of the film the action is shown ""as seen"" by him – all the talk, all the jokes. It was supposed to give the audience the intimacy and the from-the-first-hand feeling of actually sitting in the police car with the cops or joining them in their operations. Those casual cameras are everywhere: one in the hand of Brian Taylor, two on their uniform, couple in the car – the life of those fictitious cops has been carefully documented.As if that was not enough, the storyline was brushed up to give us maximum realism. There are many little stories, little jokes, little monologues and conversations, to resemble the real life, with all its complexity and simplicity. The characters come and go and return, and all we have is this couple of cops, best friends, professionals to whom we are supposed to empathise fully come the end of the film. Well, at least that was the plan of the authors.Now about how it actually feels. I have never been a big fan of the ""shaky"" camera, which, for example, annoyed no end in Hunger Games, but here is the absolute level of atrocity aimed at the inner ear. Because the camera is in the hands of the cop, authors thought it would be great to force him to shake it as much as he can. By the end of the film I was so seasick that the camera rotating 360 degrees every other minute was chasing me in nightmares. The scenes of Los Angeles from the helicopter felt like oasis – several seconds to have a rest watching steady picture. I presume that this shaky camera was done on purpose, to give us extra feeling of involvement – but in real life I never shake my head ecstatically, how can I feel that way? Then the storyline. Authors probably thought that it was good idea not to have set storyline written in the literature style – instead they have a collection of anecdotes about the life of the two cops. That was probably done, again, for further involvement and all of that, but as the result the movie became absolutely unwatchable in terms of the storytelling. The film picks up the storyline, then drops it, then picks the other one, then drops it and returns to the first one, everything without sense of direction or general understanding of purpose. Aiming to show us the life, authors missed enormously. The story of our lives, I believe, is always beautiful in its consistency, in its fluency. There is no need to invent the wheel to show interesting lives – all you need to do is to show them as they are.These shortcomings are shameful for two reasons. First is that a very promising film style, mockumentary, has been compromised badly by this movie. Why to choose it if in the end you get mumbling mess stuck somewhere in between the documentary and fictitious movies? End of Watch is the mock part of ""mockumentary"", and this is shameful.Secondly, and the reason why I wrote so much about the movie, is that the film about cops is very long overdue. The guardians of law and order (not detectives, but cops) deserve a proper anthem made on celluloid tape, something that will highlight them, and not bury their day-to-day patriotic heroism behind some trendy inventions. This movie was supposed to be about cops, but it is not about them.

Of course it is a Hollywood movie, but when you think about it you realize that what happens in this movie could be based on what happens in real life.

It is filmed in a different way making it look and feel realistic.

211,hatsunemiku-27340,A New Police Drama,8,11 September 2017,"Police dramas are a dime-a-dozen in most entertainment mediums. Television is loaded with them and has been for thirty years. The New York Times Bestseller list is usually dominated by them. And, of course, cop films are a favorite of Hollywood. The popularity of the buddy cop genre, thanks to the Lethal Weapon films, has led to dozens of imitators to varying effect. Most of these glamorize the police lifestyle or throw aside reality to provide entertainment. Every once in a while, though, we see a movie like End of Watch that asks us to look at policemen from a variety of angles, not just a heroic lens.Jake Gyllenhall plays Brian Taylor, a beat cop with the LAPD partnered with his best friend Mike Zavala (Michael Pena). The two wind up learning too much about a cartel and become the target of their viciousness.Simple premise. And from the outset you can guess what is going to happen. But the movie isn't traditional in its storytelling. We see everything from body, dashboard, and hand-held camera perspectives giving an almost Cops (the television series) like feel to it all. We the viewers are a part of the action in a way I've never encountered before. Found footage horror films are a subgenre that we've all most likely encountered for good or ill. The idea of applying that to a police film is inventive and interesting, allowing for a close-up and realistic approach to telling what is an otherwise generic and by-the-numbers central plot.What the found footage reveals are two cops who are best friends and brothers who joke around, tell stories, and are entirely human. They aren't portrayed as badass, cool, or any other convention. They're just two humans. And seeing them policing the streets we get a variety of situations that show how tough it is to be a cop. Typically a film like this would have the heroes be above the law or strictly apply it. Here they beat up supposed crooks, they get rowdy when they see something they dislike, they act like dicks. But we also see them heroically rescue children from a burning house and shoot the breeze with local hoods. That multi-dimensional aspect makes the characters interesting, human, and entirely lovable.Add to that the non-cop footage of dates and weddings, major events in the duos life. It's an air of humanity that endears End of Watch and forces you to see the police in a different and more sympathetic light.The acting here is one of the main reasons the film succeeds so well. Gyllenhaal and Pena have such great chemistry and are totally believable as best friends. Given the direction and style on top of the script, it's hard not to be fooled that the two aren't real cops and they aren't ad-libbing every conversation. It's masterful.The ending, as I said at the beginning, is obvious, but it hurts still. That's the sign of a damn good film, when even with a conventional plot line and predictable finale, you still walk away feeling emotional. Because as conventional as the majority of the movie may be, it is entirely unconventional in presentation and delivery.End of Watch is edge-of-your-seat action and drama from start to finish. Fast moving and full of stellar performances, it's the type of dark and unique cop film that breathes life into a tired genre and changes your perspective in unexpected ways. Definitely give this one a watch.",End of Watch
212,DopamineNL,"Raw, intense, realistic. Cops'll love it.",8,27 January 2014,"End of Watch is a fairly raw, intense police film about average, every day cops. In a neighborhood that's far from average, as South Central LA is probably one of the nastiest places to ride the streets in a black and white. Add to which a slight over-concentration of incidents (compared to a usual day at work, I hope) and it's hard to believe why they would want to stick to that precinct... It does make for a very strong cop-flick! The characters are quite realistic, likable and well played. The story is mostly a serious of incidents, some of which connected by an organized crime back-story, but (as in real life) our street cops only experience bits and pieces of it.

214,lilantman10,Somebody give Micheal Pena an Oscar,9,17 December 2012,"I'm a huge fan of Cop movies. This is directed and written by the same guy who did Training Day. Arguably one of the best cop movies ever made with his script that delivered great characters. I've got to say End of Watch is just as visceral and even slightly more balanced.To get the bad out of the way, there is an excessive amount of cursing. Even by normal filthy mouthed movies this is pretty high up there. It starts to become a little much and even as me somebody who curses every third statement it was a little gratuitous. The other problem is that , much like with Training Day, the non cop villains are stereotypes. The cops are given amazing dialogue while all the bad guys are given lines that come from a much lesser typical cop movie. It would've been an even better experience if Ayer could find some way to give them some depth or some funny lines to say. The direction is pretty much great except for the whole found footage that mainly stays true to itself, but a few close ups and scenery shots had me scratching my head, but they're far and few between. My only other problem is that the movie doesn't seem to have a very tight story. Which i'll address later, but other then those pretty slight gripes nothing else to mention.The good. I have constantly stated that Micheal Pena is one of, if not THE most underrated and versatile actors of this generation. For someone who could easily be casted as the Spanish guy, he always brings a new charisma to a role. He has great comedic timing which allows him to coast the line from comedy to drama. And I haven't seen him have a bad performance yet. The acting is all outstanding across the board for the main cast. The script is great with many quotable lines that will stick with you for a while. This is Micheal Pena's movie and it's a shame he probably won't get enough recognition for this role or probably ever.Aside from the great script Ayer really milks the found footage and minds it and owns it. This is Chronicle for the superhero movie. The editing is tight and it makes what could've been a slightly boring movie move a lot faster. When I came in I thought this would be an action thriller with a lot of set-pieces and shootouts. There are some shootouts and it could've used one bad ass Bad Boys 2 car chase, but then I realized that's not what this movie is about. It's a character study about these two guys who have s.o much chemistry it feels like you're in the back of the squad car laughing with them. This is a serious look at the life of a police officer. If I had to compare it to anything it'd be Lincoln Lawyer. It has classic themes of cop movies, but transcends them with great dialogue pure emotion and really not indulging in it too much. For anybody whose been in a real bro-mance it makes perfect sense. This is a real movie. It's a drama not an action movie. And as a drama it's very rewarding and I'll remember these characters for a while. Everything everybody says about it is true. It really is one of the best movies of the year, which isn't saying much. If you don't like this then stop watching movies all together.",End of Watch
215,marsmitchell79,This movie is a cuss-fest without much substance!,1,6 May 2017,"Past reference: I've heard of movies that had a lot of cussing and were actually funny: Harlem Nights. I've heard of movies that had a lot of cussing and were actually pretty good horror films: Nightmare on Elm Street 3. I've heard of movies that had a lot of cussing and could hold your interest or had an invaluable message: American History X or Dark Blue. I've heard of movies with a lot of cussing where most of the bad guys get caught or get caught up and the movie is a quality one: Goodfellas or Casino. This one opens with probably more cussing than any of those movies have early on before they can even get the movie off the ground! The cops(ALL OF THEM) cuss like gangsters and the gangsters cuss like well gangsters and nothing is going on besides an amateur youtube video op early on! Video producers, script writers, actors/actresses, and directors just don't get it; if actors cuss a lot(esp. without anything else going on), some people see your movie as classless or even a confusing pile of dung! Why not eliminate the cussing as much as possible and leave it up to people's imagination?! Mature people know some people cuss a lot, but why burden us with this and not cover it like you do in almost all love scenes?! Even if a movie is an all time great movie, cussing makes me just cringe and not want to watch anymore or for a long, long while or again! I definitely am FAR less likely to recommend a movie if there's a lot of cussing! Why cater to people that aren't discerning when most of these people watch LMN and used to watch network movies on movie nights. Therefore, if you look only at the discerning people(people that care about morality), then the people that don't discern(people not caring about morality) fall into place. That's because anyone can and will watch a movie with morality in mind if it's a good movie, but some people WILL NOT WATCH a movie that is a moral graveyard even if it's good! Then, there's more recommendation coming from more people, too, if it is both a good and moral movie. Most Lifetime, LMN, old network movies, etc.(Bitter Blood; Love, Lies, and Murder; Too Close to Home; Fat Like Me; Odd Girl Out; and Orphan and Derailed{the latter 2 were even shown in family friendly versions yet probably losing no value over their Hollywood versions} are among those) in a collection that are also ""good"" far exceed HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, etc. ""greatest"" collection(Harlem Nights, Good Fellas, Casino, Dark Blue, and American History X are among them). With the former group, there's no cringe factor(your conscience) while you watch them and you can watch most of them with your kids(except the oversexed or gay ones; the gay ones I would not watch at all). My comparison was between the cussing movies and not to show you that it can be done and well. Also, there are movies like Enemy of the State, Enough, and Training Day that are fringe movies that I own, enjoy, and watch. Still, movies that resemble ""End of Watch"" in any way should not be done in the future or toned down quite a bit! Hey, I'm all for all movie companies deciding to ""network"" it! For me, I bought it due to the great reviews trying to find a new movie, but it--like so many others--is more than likely trash! I could not get past the tsunami of cussing early on! I might try to stomach it to see if the movie has any redeemable qualities, but I SINCERELY REGRET THAT I BOUGHT THIS(EVEN FOR LESS THAN $4) AND WOULD NOT RECOMMEND UNLESS YOU CAN ACTUALLY THINK WITH CUSSING COMING AT YOU INCESSANTLY! STILL, THAT DOESN'T SAY MUCH FOR YOUR CONSCIENCE AND IT IS A CRY FOR Christian HELP. I think I'll start going to youtube and at least streaming the first 20 minutes(slow connection) and watching it before buying in the future despite seeing great reviews from 3 review sites and saying NO to hurriedly buying movies without scanning them first. I ONLY WENT THROUGH MAYBE 20 MINUTES AND IT WAS FULL OF CUSSING(HEED THAT 17 YR OLD WARNING AT THE VERY BEGINNING, PLEASE) AND WITHOUT MUCH GOING ON AT THAT TIME, TOO, MAKING IT WORSE THAN KICKBOXER 2(IF THE MOVIE KEPT PROGRESSING LIKE THAT)! I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY THAT A MOVIE COULD POTENTIALLY WORSE OFF THAN KB2!",End of Watch

The banter between the 2 leads got old and I didn't care to see shots of them with their gfs and then dancing at weddings and junk. Silly crap happens and Gyllenhaal films it all for his college class. For real, they are doing illegal stuff and he films it and laughs about it on camera...what? Makes no sense, especially for a guy that wants to make detective. He has tiny cameras they clip on their uniforms about the size of a pen, yet he also walks around carrying a handheld camcorder like it's 1999. Not only that, he does so in dangerous situations like walking into crime scenes where they don't know if they'll be ambushed.There's a scene where 2 officers get violently attacked by a gang banger and Gyllenhaal laughs about the one officer having a knife in his eye and the female officers put down the rookie that had her face repeatedly bashed in. Just completely unlikeable characters. Why should I care about any of them?At the end, after Gyllenhaal and Pena are attacked and Pena dies, they cut to an earlier scene before they are attacked where Pena tells a dumb story about his wife's parents having sex. Then the movie ends. Unbelievably stupid! Can't fathom how the same person involved in Training Day was involved with this mess!",End of Watch

Pena and Gyllenhaal work so well on screen that it really carries the movie till the very end. The basic plot of the film is that Cops Taylor (Gyllenhaal) and Zavala (Pena) are these two city cops who are the ""top guns"" on the street. Taylor starts to film the arrests and chases which gives the film a POV style/ found footage style. The film has some real great acting and the emotions run wild throughout the film and has some teary moments. there are so many great scenes which are tense but others which are funny and so the film has a great balance to it. its hard to describe the film without spoiling it, but it has all the right elements to it: great characters (and development), action throughout the film, edge of the seat tension and a few funny scenes.

Was entertaining funny interesting & captivating every second. Not one minute of this movie was lacking. Even the cheesy dance part at the wedding was kind of cute and I usually gag at that crap. I had never even heard of this movie before today and I can't understand why not! It's definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen and was so believable and realistic and relatable. Every part of this was done with thought, and the actors were so perfect for each character and made it seem like you were really watching real events even tho you know these actors from big time movies. You'd be stupid to Pass this up, it's definitely a perfect movie to watch with loved ones, just not to young because does have some violence but other than that great movie to watch with friends and family if have adult children. The love scene with Anna and Jake was done beautifully and tastefully not skanky and over the top like most movies nowadays.

219,edwardscissorhands12-874-850830,End of Watch,3,8 April 2014,"End of Watch was easily the most overrated film the year of its release. I understand the purpose of this was not to tell a story but rather show excellent chemistry between two characters, but this is about all it has going for it. The directing style of switching from first hand is no different from the scenes intended to be shot by a third person, which became extremely distracting, annoying, and unavoidable, a huge hole that really ruined the movie. The characters are interesting enough, but I feel like the writing didn't do them any justice, only making them look like a stereotypical cop who obviously dies in the end with some pictures that show the real selves in the end (no it didn't do this, but you know whet I mean). I think the reason this is so well liked is because people justify the characters are made so intricate through the realistic aspects of the directing, but as I said, it makes the entire production of the film look lazy. It prevents you from being able to tell what they are trying to do next in the very sloppy story with major in continuities and a fractured structure. End of Watch claims itself to be the best cop movie of all time, but it is far from the truth. Spend your time from watching this movie like everyone see is telling you, because you will want to END the WATCHING of it. Yeah that was bad but whatever this movie sucked bye.

A story about relationships inside the patrol car, within the station, amongst friends, and around the neighborhood.The not-too-revealing-review: This movie is a conversation piece for cinematographers and aspiring directors (and their critics): Plot, in the traditional sense, is instead put as a side-story; camera angles and perspectives are supposed to supply the drama as much as the acting or action. Ultimately I enjoyed neither aspect of the film. Pushing character development as the primary substance of the film had some aesthetic value, but it was not satisfying to me as a viewer. The shaky and disorienting camera scenes not only were unpleasant to experience, but also failed to deliver a real-life grit to what was supposed to be about real-life heroes. The acting was fine; the lines were great. The disregard for political correctness was humorous and believable.

I actually believe all cops are cowards, just by nature of their choice to become part of the system. This movie shows cops in the unrealistic light, and it is annoying.Aside from that, there was also extremely unbelievable aspects of the movie. Three fully automatic AK-47's shooting full blast from like 20 feet away at the main characters, and no one is hit. They have to walk like 15 feet with the bullets showering them, and nothing happens... Also, these gang members with a major grudge decide to kill some cops (so potentially they are going to die that same night, along with the cops). And they decide not to Double Tap, one of the cops, yet fill the other full of lead. HOW INTERESTING, that the one cop shot ONLY ONE TIME, ends up surviving...Super fake in the story turns, but also super fake in its portrayal of Police. It was a Jake Gylenhall movie so I watched it, but if you are aware of how lame cops are in real life, you will hate this movie because of how offensive it is to you.",End of Watch

Is it because of the performances, which yes, were outstanding, or this idea of friendship so overbearingly presented it became the whole movie? If yes, I can see these positive aspects and can give the film that, but it is all hidden by poor direction, a unstructured plot, and boring screenplay. The makers of the film take pride in this being one of the first ever dramas being shot with shaky cam, making it the most ""gritty"" cop film ever made. No matter what anyone says, I do not care if it was gritty, this presentation was so incredibly distracting. There is zero use for it at all, and at points I couldn't tell what was supposed to be in third person or camera perspective, carried by the mob, another aspect of the film I didn't like. The conflict with this mob is so forced and sudden that you're watching a movie with like three sort of related incidents then all of a sudden its a full out death war, totally abrupt and not smoothly lead into at all. The structure is very poor, clearly. That really is all there is to talk about, I guess the friendship themes were good, but it is too covered up in this muddled mess of a story.

But the middle and ending is extraordinary and easy to watch. Although the ending is extremely heartfelt I thought it needed to be in their to keep the real-life element (that they had going) going on properly.

226,shaososa,"Enjoyable Cop Thriller That Has Some Shaky Areas, and I Don't Mean The Camera It Was Shot On",7,24 June 2013,"The most important part of a buddy cop movie is the chemistry between the two leads. In End of Watch, it is said chemistry between Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena that is the backbone to this story. The film, chronicling the two as young LAPD patrol officers Brian Taylor and Miguel Zavala , is a buddy cop movie for the modern era. You still have the entertaining banter between the two leads that has been a staple of the genre since its popularity surged in the 80's with movies like Lethal Weapon and Tango and Cash. But director David Ayer gives an interesting spin in shooting technique as the majority of End of Watch is shot documentary style, a trend extremely prevalent amongst recent horror films.The premise of this style of shooting is that Gyllenhaal's character is taking a film class and he is using his footage for a class project. But its not just the cops who are documenting the film's events; practically everyone is recording. Both the gangs Taylor and Zavala cross paths with are filming as well, which lessens End of Watch's culpability even more than it would if it was just Taylor with the camera. But, it's a relatively small concession to make in order to appreciate the rest of the movie.Ayer doesn't pull punches here. While the back and forth between the two cops is hilarious at times, the events that make up their days on the job are not. The situations they face are intense, adrenaline packed affairs, but Ayer does a good job at not making them feel like some dumb popcorn action movie. The suspense is high and an unusual sense of eeriness for a movie in this category is prevalent at times. Its a good thing. From a missing child report that ends in gut wrenching results, to the search of a suspected drug trafficker's house that unearths something much more sinister than drugs; Ayer captures the grim realities in all their terror.But something also prevalent throughout End of Watch is an underlying sense that you are being recruited to be a police officer. There is a rah rah sentiment that underscores Taylor and Zavala's heroics all the way leading up to the poorly executed, predictable ending. I couldn't help but feel that I was being dictated to as exactly why I needed to like these two guys. They are heroes, husbands, fathers, great cops. The two display no scratches in the armor, which ultimately makes them less memorable, no matter how funny or charismatic.",End of Watch

228,ThePadraigMoista,Great film. But fell apart towards its long and delayed climax.,7,5 December 2012,"End of Watch follows two police officers - Brian Taylor(Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike Zavala(Michael Pena) - as they cruise around South Central Los Angelas. After a number of encounters with the typical people you'd find in the ghetto among other things, they end up becoming marked for death by the Cartels.I loved the intro, however contradictory it was, and it attained my interest immediately. As the film progressed, it became more and more of a David Ayer film which is a good thing. His style of filmmaking and writing are instantly recognizable. The film promoted great performances from its two leads as well as its secondary characters and the chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Pena was great. It's one of the best buddy-cop films I've seen in a long time. It also puts a spin on the ""found footage"" type of making film. It doesn't have a cameraman, just Gyllenhaal and Pena's characters recording with their own cameras, more predominately Gyllenhaal. It was pretty authentic and seemed like it didn't listen to anyone. Except the end, where it fell apart.I enjoyed the first while of it. I understood the film it was trying to be and it achieved that. Now that it was there, it didn't know where to go, it seemed like Ayer lost track of what he wanted to write and just continued on with same thing. It became a bit repetitive. After much deliberation with dragged out scenes and unnecessary scenes really, it got into it. And when it did, it didn't know which way was up. The ending should have been completely changed, the last 20 minutes or so. It didn't keep in tone with the whole rest of the film and just wasn't good. Could have been a bit shorter, and a better ending it would have been in countenance for the best film of 2012. Had so much hope and so much going for it. I'll still go and see the next David Ayer film however, as I did like this.A modest 7/10.",End of Watch
229,gt-thereelword,Well handled and Hard hitting,9,14 November 2012,"It's not hard to tell that David Ayer grew up on the mean streets of South Central, Los Angeles. Training Day, The Fast and the Furious, Dark Blue and S.W.A.T. all showcase his passion for writing screenplays about these streets and the role that police officers play in them. His two films as director (Harsh Times and Street Kings) showed that he could also direct hard hitting dramas depicting the underbelly of the L.A. and the police force. End Of Watch marks Ayer's second film as both writer and director.Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña star as a two young officers in the Los Angeles Police Department. Using the ""home footage"" format of filmmaking, End Of Watch shows us the ups and downs of these two young officers as they work, love and fight in the streets of Los Angeles.In terms of subject matter this film doesn't cover anything really different. Its about cops dealing with their issues at home and on the job. This topic has been covered countless times but what makes End Of Watch different – and better – then many of its predecessors is that it holds realism as its number one priority. This is one of the most realistic portrayals of police life ever put to celluloid. The day to day lives of these two best friends are shown in a format that is both convincing and horrifying. It doesn't flinch away when showing the disturbing aspects of this high pressure career.Using everyday video sources (chest mounted cameras, vehicle cameras, P.O.V angels, aerial shots from police choppers) definitely gives the film an unprecedented level of proximity to cops in the line of duty. Unfortunately, this format doesn't always work. Some chaotic scenes become a little bit confusing when the camera is constantly changing from first person shots to third person angles. But for the most-part it works well.Gyllenhaal and Peña provide us with two highly believable characters and their chemistry is palpable. Whether they're talking about the women in their lives or having a friendly argument about racial stereotypes, these two actors ensure that we stick with their characters through every step of the way. Gyllenhaal continues to solidify himself as one of the best actors around and Peña delivers one of his best performances to date.It's got a great script and a focused story that is handled confidently and told well. David Ayer has crafted an intense, hard hitting drama that benefits from the two excellent performances by the two leads.",End of Watch

And one of my only gripes with this film is that there are moments when you are wondering who the heck is filming, and why are they filming this event. But for the most part, it actually works. In fact, I think the whole ""documentary style"" people keep talking about is an incorrect description. I would put this film on a similar level with Chronicle (except there it was clear exactly who was filming, all the time). The way End of Watch is filmed makes it more personal, and makes you really connect with the characters more.You can absolutely believe that Jake and Michael are long time best friends. Their banter while on patrol seems natural and unscripted. Thus it is emotional, and you really connect when things go wrong, or at family events. And now for the spoiler part. WARNING. From the outset, it seems fairly clear that one of them is going to die. BUT it keeps you guessing as to who it will be. Some films (looking at you Gangster Squad) make it so obvious who will die. So it was refreshing to be kept on my toes trying to figure out who it would be, if anyone.There was only one moment of ""Stormtrooper aim"" but it didn't detract from anything, and was actually understandable. Untrained gangsters popping off AKs, I can see them missing. I highly recommend this film to anyone, and is for sure worth a slot in your film collection.",End of Watch

And he didn't let me down, both he and Pena were brilliant, i forgot i was watching two actors and almost started to believe they were real cops!I liked this film as it wasn't the usual Hollywood glitz and glam portrayal of the police force that you normally get from our friends over the pond. It felt very real, very hard hitting and often had me at the edge of my seat.The negatives would be the hand held camera style that seems so popular at the moment. It made me feel a bit sick and dizzy in places, especially during the first ten minutes.I'm not sure whether its all hand held to make the movie seem more realistic (tbh the storyline and acting is that good that they could have got away with not using it) or whether its just because that seems to be the craze at the moment....in which case the novelty is starting to wear off. It was great in the Blair witch project, but that was 13 years ago so its not really a novelty anymore! (hey at least they didn't do it 3d though!)The other negative point would be the character of Janet played by Anna Kendrick. I'm assuming the scriptwriters were trying to make her as likable and perfect as possible but she just came across as a bit too sugary sweet and downright annoying. Anna Kendricks acting ability didn't really match Jake and Michaels standard either so the bits with her in it made it feel more like a movie with actors and less like its actually happening there in front of you.All in all though a very good film and a lot more realistic than the police films the Americans normally churn out",End of Watch

It was creative and unusual, especially the dash cam pov used in the beginning. The film moves quickly and is certainly not boring. What didn't work was the cartoonish characterizations of the Mexican gang members. They were so over the top that I found them more funny than scary, especially the main Latina gang member. She looked like Lady Ga Ga on crack. The ambush scene at the end, totally over the top and unbelievable. The director had one to many red bulls the day they shot this scene, a good old fashion ""Bullitt"" style car chase would have been great, with the bangers chasing the cops ending in a massive I-5 pile up, now that would be believable. The worst scene was the cop and the black dude getting all cage fight at the beginning, what cop would do that? and if one of them was to do it, Jake's character should have been the one, not the family man side kick.

There have been a lot of negative reviews on IMDb about this film, though most of them are unfounded.Most of the complaints I've seen are of the ""gangsters"" and their continual dropping of the ""F"" bomb every other word. I grew up around gangs, and believe me, that's the way they talk. Do you expect them to be portrayed as educated and well cultured, when most gang members never finish middle school, much less higher education.Second, police have the power of discretion, meaning that they can write you a ticket, or let you go. Same goes with cops in LA. You would be surprised how many cops use their discretion and choose alternate means of intervention. (the fight at the beginning) As far as the movie goes, Jake, as always, gives another intense performance. This movie is based on storyline, not explosions as most cop movies these days are.The only ""unrealistic"" part of this movie is at the end where the gang bangers have the two cops cornered. Two AK-47s and a .45 that's 67 rounds...and Jake's character isn't hit...even though his partner takes several to the back while leaning over Jake's character.

End of Watch gives the viewer a peek behind the shield and shows that cops are ordinary people who live and work under extraordinary conditions. Normally I don't like the hand- held camera/documentary style of filming, however in this movie it works and really adds to the realism. I definitively want to give a shout out to Anna Kendrick, playing Brian's girlfriend/wife as well as America Ferrera who plays Mike's wife. The on-screen chemistry of the cast, especially these four is what made ""End of Watch"" such a great movie. I was engrossed from the jump and stayed that way until the end.

That, and positive buzz from the festival circuit, gave me some measure of hope that I was really going to enjoy End of Watch but it just didn't quite do it for me. Unfortunately, both of the big problems land squarely in Mr. Ayer's lap.Can fake found footage film making be finally finished? I, for one, have had it. It was revolutionary in The Blaire Witch project. Today...blase, blase, blase. This movie actually takes it to a whole new level, where the cops are making videos while on the beat and the crooks are making videos as they commit the crimes. If they'd put down their own cameras for a second they could probably watch their opponents' every move on YouTube. This gimmick (I won't even call it a directorial flourish) plays about as ludicrously as I've made it sound. Again, I ask: Since the found footage snake is obviously eating its own tale, can we just stand back and let it finish its meal? Thank you.So, besides coming off like Cops meets Lethal Weapon live tweeted, the other problem is with the script. End of Watch is SUCH a stereotypical buddy cop movie. I spent almost the entire run time going, ""Oh, that's just like in _________, only shot on much lower quality film"". The screenplay's only saving grace lies in the dialogue between the two main characters as they ride around in their squad car. Fragments of that are actually quite witty.Which leads to the real bright point of the film: Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena's performances. They have great on screen chemistry, and their interaction is THE reason to check out this picture (once). This should be a real breakout role for Pena, who actually manages to upstage his far more famous co-star. Together they are able to overcome the predictability of the movie and make it enjoyable for scant moments...but only moments...3 of 5 stars.additional movie reviews and more can be found at http://fb.me/1RYJhMyPN",End of Watch
238,moosish-628-965954,Excellent film; gritty; realistic; emotional,9,3 September 2015,"I had no idea what to expect with this film. It was on late-night cable TV, heavily edited for profanity, and loaded with long ads, but despite all that, I found it to be powerful and quite effective.The directing and editing gave it an authenticity that we usually only see on real-life shows like ""COPS."" Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña were as believable as believable can be as cops; outstanding performances!My only complaint is that the final drama (the gang setting the cops up with incredibly good planning) seemed truly over the top - too melodramatic and not believable as something that could really happen in real life. (Maybe I'm wrong -- did something like that ever really happen and I just don't know about it?) That being said, the scenes were masterfully executed and emotionally wrenching.I'm glad I watched this. I'd like to see it again, but unedited next time. And this movie gave me even more respect for Jake Gyllenhaal's wonderful talent!",End of Watch
239,KiltsMcGee,Compelling with a taut climax.,8,17 May 2015,"More than anything else, this film makes me want to visit South Central California so much less. I am unaware of how factual the events presented in this film actually are but the amount of gun crime and Satanists in the film is enough to repel me indefinitely.End of Watch tells the story of the circumstantially heroic police officers one of which is filming their patrols for his filmmaking class. Shots are fired, lives are lived and poops hit their respective fans.The film adopts a style similar to Cloverfield in that all the characters are aware that the camera is there but also are operating it themselves. It doesn't go as far as Cloverfield as to have the story seen from only one perspective but this setup gives a lot of the shots context as to why they look so rough and unconventional. In order to properly compliment this style, it is important that the actors give realistic and human performances. Luckily for everyone who has seen this film, the actors more than deliver on this front. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña submit a living and believable relationship. There are many short scenes of the two characters talking in their patrol car during downtime. These moments are easily the most enjoyable and interesting in the film. They show how the relationship between the characters develops over time and even bring the themes of the film to the fore (these themes may have been a little heavy-handedly delivered though). Without a doubt, the two lead actors supply some of the most human and believable performances seen in decades making the twist and turns of the story impact you so much more.While the performances are very grounded, some of the plot points seemed to me rather contrived. There is an early scene in which Peña picks a fight with a random guy in his own home. It serves no purpose to the story at the time but later on, the random guy comes back into the story with some information. The first scene was made entirely so the character could tell the police officers something later. There are other scenes that are clearly only there for foreshadowing, which is fine but they were fundamentally unnecessary to the story.Linked to this and the Cloverfield comparisons, the camera-work can often be disorienting. This is mostly used to good effect, specifically during the climax, but sometimes it simply looks ugly and does not suit the tone of the scene. In the same vein as the camera-work, there is one scene containing a fire in which the fire was obviously just a flickering orange light shining from off camera. This stuff was very effective in taking me out of the film.The main story of the film is incredibly compelling. There are moments in the film where the characters seem undoubtedly expendable. At the end, you really want the characters to succeed despite their difficult situation. The climax itself is an undeniably incredible moment. It is paced excellently and there is genuine fear for the characters. It takes the entire length of the film turning these fictional characters into actual humans that you care about and then they are dropped into a perilous position. It's a textbook structure but it is executed to perfection.",End of Watch
240,WydeOpen,"99 minutes of potentially pulse pounding action and suspense and 10 minutes of ""This is it?!?!"""" payoff.",5,20 September 2012,"End Of Watch is approximately 99 minutes of potentially pulse pounding action and suspense and 10 minutes of ""This is it?!?!"""" payoff. The movie has been advertised in the above trailer and others as a gritty, action packed movie about two cops who through the course of duty cross a Mexican drug cartel and now must ""watch their 6"" (slang for watch your back) from violent retribution. This, by itself is a very interesting, compelling premise. Then add in the fact that the film was written and directed by David Ayers , the man behind (either as writer or director) other successful LA cop movies such as Training Day , Dark Blue , Street Kings , Harsh Times , S.W.A.T.  and even was the screenwriter of The Fast and Furious, it's a very exciting movie to look forward toward. Unfortunately, the execution of the idea got buried in over an hour and a half of attempting to build a rapport between the audience and the main characters. Except for a high-speed chase that opens the first three minutes, almost all of the action happens, literally, at the very tail end of the movie. We're subjected to extended time and conversations with Gyllenhaal and  Peña as they unsuccessfully attempt to establish believable chemistry between their characters. Although, as typical of a David Ayers script, the dialog is crisp and believable and captures (what I imagine) realistic cop jargon, the supposed friendship of the two characters feels forced, artificial and contrived.The majority of the movie focuses on that relationship between LA police partners Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal ) and Mike Zavala (Michael Peña ) over the course of many months. (Since there is never a reference to a time-line anywhere throughout the film, which was a bit annoying, I originally thought the movie took place over a few days.) We see the officers' daily routine via lapel video cameras and a hand-held camera Taylor carries for a class project in which he's involved. The cameras document the officers as they serve warrants, make traffic stops & drug busts and assist fellow officers (including an almost unrecognizable America Ferrera  from Ugly Betty ) policing Precinct 13. The neighborhood is sometimes dangerous and difficult to patrol since a small Hispanic street gang's presence and influence grows as Mexican drug cartels infiltrate South Central Los Angeles. Colorful background characters are littered throughout the film including a Ayers' film regular casting: former LA Blood Gang member Cle Shaheed Sloan  as Mr. Tre.  As Sloan's face is recognizable to fans of director David Ayers' previous films and from Sloan's work in the LA  police TV drama Southland , this film is just as familiar. It's not as gritty, intriguing, complex nor exciting as any of his other, better films; just as familiar. The frantic ending is so similar to at least three other Ayer films that at the point of the film where the poorly built tension should finally peak, that it generates about as much suspense as a National Geographic special documenting zebras crossing a den of lions. A",End of Watch
241,hgrahovac4,A lesson for those who say that this movie sucks,10,18 June 2016,"I re-watched this movie because my sister and her boyfriend told me that the movie sucked, the cinematography was epilepsy inducing and which I consider one of the dumbest arguments ever, too much swearing. Seeing this for the second time very carefully I realized that this is a really good cop movie. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena nail their roles as Taylor and Zavala. That dumb argument about too much swearing is actually that Mexican gang (Curbside Locos, I believe) who aren't even that much in the movie. The cinematography isn't epilepsy inducing because it was shot documentary style although it is frustrating to see the camera shake most of the time. All in all, End of Watch is a great cop movie which again showcases Ayer as a great writer of dramas set in LA and as a director. For you DC fans, I recommend watching this and Fury due to the fact that Roman Vasyanov shot both of these movies in preparation for Suicide Squad this August.",End of Watch
242,brendanfoy,"It's like the Cops T.V. show, but with Hollywood histrionics",6,21 February 2013,"I like David Ayer and I love his cop dramas. Training Day and Dark Blue may not approach the brilliance of Friedkin's The French Connection, but they're some of the best crime thrillers we've had since. I also really enjoyed Street Kings and to an extent I like Harsh Times. The only 'The Fast and the Furious' movie I enjoyed is the first one, penned by Ayer.End of Watch is a good film held back by some personal nags of mine. I thought the whole faux documentary presentation was nothing more than a gimmick meant to tap into the found footage craze currently making millions in movie theaters all around. Ayer, who directed in addition to writing, chooses to use both conventional camera angles in addition to the many different cameras his cop/film student character Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) places on himself, his partner, the interior of his car, and carries in his hand. Aside from the difficulty in suspending my disbelief that a young patrol cop would even be allowed to do this, especially in a movie going for gritty realism, Ayer doesn't consistently stick with the faux documentary camera work. He routinely ""cheats"" with how the action is filmed. Why not get creative and stick to the found footage/documentary style by using not only the cameras Brian Taylor himself set up, but security and street cam footage, cell phone camera footage captured by witnesses, and footage from citizen activists who go out and films cops on patrol? There are gangbangers we see filming with their own camera as well, yet it's rarely used, so End of Watch uses the shaky, jerky, zoomed in footage that are typical of the found footage genre, but it routinely strays from this when it wants to while still resisting truly cinematic shots which could have enhanced the experience. It's strange watching the movie through one of Taylor's personal cameras, only to see footage of Taylor and his partner filming with camera in hand as if there's some unknown cameraman following them around. In my opinion, Ayer should have just taken a page from William Friedkin's playbook and made use of the hand-held, documentary style of film making for key scenes, but shoot it properly for the rest of the film and dropped the pseudo found footage gimmick. The camera work was distracting not simply because it used the found footage style but because in my opinion it looked like a sloppy mixture of two different styles; however, the writing is what carries this movie. The story isn't anything new, you have two likable and normal young cops whose youth and relative inexperience make them fearless, but naive, crime fighters. One is White, one is Mexican, they come from very different backgrounds but are united in what they do for a living and are close friends (some would call it a bromance). We meet their significant others briefly, witness both perform an act of heroism, and watch them make certain arrests which catch the attention of the Mexican drug cartel that later comes into play in the movie. I thought the story was written and presented well, I liked these cops enough to care what happened to them, and I thought the cartel threat was introduced and built up effectively. There are certain young gang bangers who could probably use some acting classes, and the characters for the most part are one dimensional, but my main gripe with the story is that after all this build up with the cartel, the movie ends just when I was hooked. The cartel is irritated by the arrests the young cops make that interfere with its business, so they order a hit on the two cops. Most of the movie was spent getting us to know and like these guys, so now that they are in danger (and don't take the danger seriously), I wanted more tense moments fearing for their life. Once they are fired upon and pinned down, I was hoping for a more prolonged and dramatic fire fight. I think 10 more minutes of tension combined with 10 more minutes of the gun fights at the end would have been perfect. I really wanted the movie to go for a Warriors like vibe where the cops are in unfamiliar gangland territory and every gang aware of the hit is trying to take them down, but it's all over too quick and for a city wide hit, we only see one group of four try to take them down.Since I thought it fizzled at the end, the story didn't save this film from the annoying camera work. I suppose Ayer was trying to make a point that despite previous acts of heroism which may or may not have gone to the heads of these young cops, not every hero has a glorious end. These guys survive a nasty looking fire fight in the beginning of the movie, they rush into a burning building to save three children, they restrain from killing a massive thug who has brutally assaulted and nearly killed two of their fellow cops, and even earn street cred with a couple of the street gangsters, but they're just two scared kids in a dark street at the end of it all. That sounds like an excellent movie, but it just wasn't executed as well as I thought it could have been, particularly the end which felt rushed.",End of Watch

246,Tomas_T,Intense documentary-style film,8,31 March 2013,"With tittle End of Watch writer David Ayer - mostly known to big crowds as the writer of excellent crime film Training Day - tests his skills in directing with good results. The film tells a straightforward story of two young LA police officers, Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Zavala (Michael Pena) and how they deal with hazardous situations on their daily patrols at the City of Angels.What immediately separates End of Watch from the crowd is the documentary-style directing, which means that the whole film is presented to viewer as if they were watching real life events via Officer Taylor's video recorder. This challenging directing method enables the director to put the viewer literally right in the middle of the action as Taylor and Zavala roam around the streets waiting another perilous dispatch call. Documentary-style is a tricky business as it is so very easy to blow the atmosphere with even the slightest glitch, but thankfully End of Watch manages to retain the atmosphere credible through the film ... mostly. There were few scenes which felt somewhat overdone and disconnected from reality which reduced the credibility somewhat, but thankfully these scenes are few and far between and do not affect the whole experience.Overall End of Watch works very well and delivers a credible documentary-style film experience. The films success was evident for me towards the end of running time as the characters had really grew on me and I felt strong connection with the officer pair as they joke around and share their most intimate experiences during their patrols.",End of Watch

Those POV shots combined with hand held camera are something new and give this film more realism, somehow you are pulled into action much more.

248,LawyerTom1,"Flawed cops, flawed villains, stereotyped action",4,5 April 2013,"The premise of End of Watch, that the two very flawed L.A. City law enforcement officers, are wearing mini-cams for a cinema verite recording of their patrols, is clever. However, much of the film is made with ordinary cameras making ordinary shots, which demeans what was to be a unique theme and perspective.The other overriding aspect of the film is that everyone is flawed, even South Central L.A. Does anyone decent live there? From lousy ex-cons, like the ones I use to defend, to sociopaths from Mexican drug cartels, all the baddies are from 6 to 10 on the sick-o scale, with the banditos from south of the border all in the 9-10 range. But the central characters (played well by Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña) are a six, and many of their fellow officers are in the 4-5 range. Ironically, only the female cops appear to be what an idealized street cop should be. Sexist claptrap? The final battle scene, with the cavalry arriving decisively, but late, is awful. Of course the Cartel baddies have to die, blown away in a hailstorm of gunfire. But, really,where were they when our heroes were being hunted down like two outgunned rabbits being played like a fiddle by evil incarnate? If the last minute 911 call had really gone through, backup would have swarmed the area, not arrived late and all together.If the characters in the movie had been given some depth, if the story line was not geared to move from one evil gross-out to the next, if the DEA guys did not look like a posse from Seal Team 6, if if if.The promise was there, but End of Watch fails to deliver.",End of Watch
249,jertrav33,"Gritty Cop Show, Great Acting",8,20 October 2012,"I saw ""End of Watch"" today and counted 583 f-bombs in the first hour. After that I lost count, but I'm assuming it must have gone over a thousand by film's end. But—you know what?—it sounded entirely reasonable in light of the setting in really tough ""gangsta"" L.A. Officer Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Officer Mike Zavala (Michael Pena) cruise South Central L.A., looking for crimes and bad guys and finding both in unlikely abundance—child abuse, house fire, a coyote house filled with thirty or forty illegals imprisoned in filth, drug cartel and gang-banger shootouts. And nearly the entire film is shown by hand-held camera or tiny lapel cameras (Taylor is making a film of their daily activities for a filmmaking class he's taking), by dashboard cams, or by other hand-held cameras or cell phones of onlookers to various crimes. It creates a frenetic movement that approximates the high-speed violence of the cops and bangers. The film is all about the dangers the boys in blue face on a daily basis. But more important, it's about the blue brotherhood of the entire force, especially the bond between Taylor and Zavala. They're brothers, even more than brothers. If they were gay they'd be lovers. But they're both married, Taylor to Janet (Anna Kendrick), Mike to his childhood sweetheart Gabby (Natalie Martinez), and married forever it seems. At Brian and Janet's wedding reception, the two do a really clever dance expressing their feelings for each other. Mike tells Brian that when he asked his grandmother if he should marry Gabby, she told him: ""If you can live without her, then man-up and cut her off. Don't string her along."" That's what the relationship between the two officers is all about, nearly an inability to live without the other. Great movie. Great acting. Go see it.",End of Watch

For instance, when they have sex, this is being filmed AND the camera is moving while filming. This could mean that they were acting out some sort of fantasy, being filmed by one of their friends, or this is just really poorly thought out. There are A LOT of scenes (I honestly think at LEAST 10 % of all the shots) that are filmed by ""a third non- existing party"".Also, they try REALLY hard to make this movie ""bad-ass"" but they really fall back into badly acted and irritating stereo types (especially the Mexican gangsters).I don't know why I have watched the whole thing, probably just curious if they could salvage at least something in the end, but it got worse and worse. Finally I also wanted to comment on the gangster scenes. WHY do both parties (the black gang and the Mexican gang) have at least 1 guy filming them?? What would these gangs have to gain from that? They probably did this so they could show you some scenes through the eyes of the gangsters, but they already have truly messed this up as I have previously explained by showing ""regular camera work"" so why bother giving the gangsters cameras if they could have just filmed them in the conventional way??I am really sorry for the amateuristic way of putting this all down, but I am Dutch, not English and I am really tired, so I really didn't want to spend to much time on this, but I just wanted to spill my guts over this abomination.Two thumbs down, not worth watching, waste of time and money.

The abundance of chemistry between the entertainingly prolific duo is easily comparable to the heroes of Bad Boys and Lethal Weapon. Their camaraderie essential to keeping emotions of the job under control, smooths the balance of shocking events and rash behaviour, creating a real bond of trust. Ayer's piece is bold and gritty. No holding back on the profanities and real fear factor of the job.

One of them is ambitious, trying to make it up the ranks to detective, while the other is content to do his job well. The so-called ""innovative"" use of cameras is annoying more so than interesting or engaging as the director literally switches angles EVERY second in some scenes just to create the illusion of excitement. If it were a scene that required it, I would understand, but this happens even when the protagonists are chatting in the confines of their squad car. Pena and Gyllenhall have the right mix, but that seems to be the only allure of the picture. The supporting cast, aside from ""Mr. Evil"", were amateurish in their acting, and the gang members were beyond stereotypical, but trite.

They're lenient towards a certain drug dealer, because, you know, these guys are cool and likable. Doing their duty they stumble upon the evil deeds of criminals who are perhaps too big for mere cops to handle. Did I mention just how much inadvertent stumbling upon major criminal activities happens in this movie? Maybe that's an LAPD thing. There's one scene in particular, where Frank Grillo's character drunkenly talks to younger men in uniform, where I just couldn't bear the mind-boggling stereotypes. Someone give this man some decent material to act in instead of wasting his talent like this. For all the screen time they get it would've also helped for the Mexican gang members to be portrayed as more than just a bunch of swearing caricatures. Excessive violence and casual sexism is everywhere. It reminded me a lot of Training Day in that way; this movie's writer- director turned out to be the writer on that movie too.

While in places the dialog is so fast that it's hard to catch what's being said, the writers pick you up later to let you in on it so that you're never left out for long enough to lose the story. They don't coddle you but they take care of you. It's a treat to be treated this way - like an intelligent viewer.And the photography - sometimes you only get a suggestion of what's happening, like a painting that hints at figures, so the viewer isn't sure where the figures begin and the background ends. Or figures are cut and pasted like collage onto the moving screen. The rationale for these effects is that the movie is being filmed by a cop, or sometimes a pair of cops, who are documenting their work shift, sometimes openly, sometimes surreptitiously. What we get is a cop movie that's not just a cop movie, but also a work of art.End of Watch is movie for people who like to care deeply about the characters in the story they're watching. It's a movie for people who care also about details but who don't need every story thread to go through a needle - as long as it's able to. It's a movie to watch again, and probably again and again; to keep in a permanent collection and bring out, like a bottle of very good wine, to watch with good friends.",End of Watch
263,philby_7,police drama from inside,8,20 March 2013,"Well, this movie baffled me as it isn't exactly a movie it is like a series edited in order to create a movie, a good movie. For starters the good stuff, the camera work is great in my opinion and its divided in 3 integral parts. a) Of course the handycam carried by one of the main characters named ""Brian"". At first it made me a bit dizzy but as the movie evolved it really adds a sense of anxiety, danger as if trouble is imminent, good thing the use isn't excessive but wisely judged. b) The squad car cam, like before it is used as much as it should and it really instills realism at its most honest. For viewers like me who live outside of the U.S. is uncommon -we don't see it every day in the news- so its a nice addition. And finally the directors cam, the tempo is great, cinematography quiet good and it gives a pessimistic tone to this part of L.A. that is in motion with the movie. And of course all those come together with great editing.The characters. Well the performances are great if only the script was less dramatized. So we have 2 good guys trying to do honest police work -nothing wrong here- and their close friendship strengthened by their on screen chemistry, makes you if you are a guy in his 30s like me, part of their crew. You connect with them, they have no agenda no secret motives, just 2 straightshooters trying to do L.A. a safer place. Beyond that they are smart and capable of decent police work. To explain my earlier statement -that it feels like a serial made movie- every patrol is an episode and the parts in between, vital to character development, but in my opinion inadequate. The side characters are a bit indifferent and they have no influence on their decisions whatsoever when they are in the line of duty.They negatives. Just one but critical to me, the ending. For those who found this review interesting enough to reach this far let me tell you that here comes the big spoiler. When I say the ending I don't mean Miguel's death, I mean the final shootout which after the initial ambush from which they escape unscathed, it goes all wrong. First the woman with the baby whose apartment they enter, why is she yelling giving them away? She lives in a crime ridden area and she is so annoyed by 2 policemen? Secondly when they leave the apartment they kill a guy in the corridor carrying an AK47, why don't they take it? Thirdly later on they jump a fence and find themselves in an alley after they shoot a guy in a car. Why for god's sake don;t they take the car? Wouldn't it multiply their chances for survival? And finally the cavalry arrives only when it is too late, is it intentional given the implied conspiracy towards the protagonists from earlier on? Or simple incompetence? It made me think that Miguel's death was somehow forced to add drama in a movie which didn't need more than what it already had.Those ""plot holes"" ruined for me what it could have been an immaculate police drama. 7.5/10",End of Watch
264,roskvo,"Promising cinematic concept, very poor execution.",3,25 November 2012,"There is one scene involving an eye injury in this film which is supposed to be dead serious and gruesome - I won't spoil it, but it is unintentionally laugh out loud funny. And that about sums it up.Jake Gyllenhaal has probably hit a career low here, every bit as unconvincing as you might expect if you've read any of the interviews he's given on the film. If you compare his performance to Woody Harrelson's as an LA cop in 'Rampart', it becomes depressing to think how formulaic and banal this is. Michael Pena, on the other hand, is generally pretty good but the dialogue script becomes so bad in places that there is nothing he can do to make it work.The banter between the partners, contrary to claims in cast interviews, does not work and at times is comparable to 'Dude, Where's my car?' without the punchlines. Don't be fooled into thinking that the chemistry worked because of the emotionally manipulative, sentimental ending (which arrives after the most clichéd Mexican gangster flick showdown scene possible).Most of the lesser characters are convincing with a couple of (again) unintentionally comical examples of over-acting. Even the semi-improvised dialogue falls down at times and if you can recall how fluid and natural the dialogue was in the TV show 'The Wire', this is at times like the opposite of that - completely lacking authenticity.The found footage element of the back-story is a complete waste of time - if you want to film a documentary style, just do it, don't create a convoluted premise. The style seems to be a homage to the first two series of the LA cop TV drama 'Southlands' but End of Watch falls way, way, way short of that quality of script. The overall look of the film is impressive though, a dazzling mix of serious documentary style and crazy first person computer game - the variety of interesting shots selected by Roman Vasyanov deserves a better script. The sets are well chosen.If you've seen Southlands and Rampart, this film is completely unnecessary and unconvincing. Whats more, if you're from LA this will probably seem like some sort of voyeuristic tourist trip through the crime hotspots and in that sense somewhat morally bankrupt.",End of Watch
265,laheyray,A 21st century police drama with grit and humor,8,11 September 2012,"END OF WATCH (2012)Most police buddy films are predictable and stereotyped. End of Watch is anything but. Predictable it never gets, and even if one guy is white (Jake Gyllenhaal as Taylor), and his partner Latino (Michael Peña as Zavala), the witty and realistic dialogue between the two ensures that neither is ever really typecast. The film succeeds because it takes a pretty honest look at police work in the often dangerous situation of south Los Angeles, and punctuates that with some pretty gripping action. Much of its tension comes from its background situation, the very real and creeping influence of the Mexican drug cartels as they infiltrate southern California.The script (by director David Ayer, who also wrote Training Day among others) is first-rate. At its best it is reminiscent of Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, with its mix of the routine, the salacious and the serious. There is an honesty even in the raunchiness, and the conversation sounds something like what two young guys who worked with one another might actually say over the course of a shift together. (Ayer has stated that that the original screenplay was much more ""scatological."") The script even manages to work into their dialogue a real humor, partly arising from the situations, partly coming from the exchanges of two friends who just have fun in putting one another down.Gyllenhaal is at his best. His fans will be delighted, and even those who have become more ambivalent since Brokeback Mountain will be pleasantly surprised. But Michael Peña is never overshadowed by him, and more than holds his own. Between the two there is a fantastic chemistry, all the more unexpected in that Ayer has reported that at first the two didn't get along. Over a five month training regime, however, they seem to have built up a relationship of unalikes that comes through in the finished product. Their differences and their mutual put-downs can't quite hide a comfort level and a trust that is central to the story. The genuineness that emerges in the two officers is underpinned by the depiction of their girlfriend/wives, who, although in far smaller roles, contribute a note of realism to life outside the police cruiser. Anna Kendrick (Janet) comes across as someone Gyllenhaal could really fall in love with, just as the vivacious character of Natalie Martinez (Gabby) complements the fun side of Michael Peña.Interestingly, Ayer seems not so much concerned with plot as with telling the story of police work in an often difficult neighborhood: their duties, their dangers, and sometimes the drudgery of what they must do (like traffic citations). To keep this mood, Ayer originally had even planned to use unknown actors. In fact the movie has at times almost a semi-documentary style that makes for a 'news-like' realism. The footage in the film is often from a Canon XA10 hand-held, and there is simulated footage also from the clip-on Scorpion micro cameras used today by police officers to record their activities. (The actual footage from Scorpions was not of high enough quality.) What emerges is a crisp and gritty story line, what Ayer calls ""a mosaic of reality,"" a mix of the very ordinary with heightened action scenes. Ayer has said that most of the situations shown were ones encountered by his friend (and technical adviser for the film, who also plays the police captain), Jaime FitzSimons, during his 14 year service with the LAPD. The overall intent of the film is made clear when towards the end of the credits comes a recognition of all those who serve in law enforcement.The pacing here is great, with police life and home life, procedure and action, the serious and the funny juxtaposed but never compromising each other. It becomes a difficult picture to end, but Ayer succeeds by means of a quite unexpected coda. If you're looking for a police buddy film like Beverly Hills Cop or Rush Hour, you won't find it here. But if you're open to a 21st century police drama with something of the grit of The French Connection, End of Watch deserves a look.End of Watch premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2012. It goes into general release on September 21st.Ray Lahey",End of Watch

I had to write a review, and hopefully save someone else the wasted time, and money.Let's get to the one good thing in the whole film. The acting. It wasn't academy award material, but it was believable, and the leads did an admirable job given the extremely shoddy script they had to work with.The entire film, save for the last 15 minutes was a disjointed, hodgepodge mess of non related scenes thrown together like some extended version of the TV show C.O.P.S. Just with more profanity, and less excitement. I mean a LOT less excitement. There was very little action, and there was no build up of tension. Just cutting from one uninteresting scenario to another... All with no pay off.I cannot put into words how bad this thing was. I'm sitting here trying to find the right adjectives, but I think my summary at the top pretty much sums it up.I just left the theater less than half an hour ago, and I couldn't tell you the name of a single character in the whole film, that's how uninteresting they were.The only reason I went to see this was because of the reviews here on the IMDb. I believe now that this website must be infiltrated by studio plants, because there is no way it's getting rave reviews by real people.As we were leaving the theater, I heard several people complaining about the movie. As a matter of fact, I don't remember a single line from the film, but I remember verbatim a quote from another person leaving the theater.. ""Wow, that was really terrible.""

My uncle worked on an LAPD gang task unit in east LA. I did several ride alongs with him. Watching Gyllenhaal and Peña is like being in the squad car again with my uncle and his partner. LAPD officers are a very specific type of human being. Peña and Gyllenhaal did an amazing job portraying those officers and the relationships they have as partners. I asked my uncle what he thought of this movie. He said it was hands down the best portrayal of LAPD officers and what they go through. Can't think of any higher praise than that.,End of Watch

271,joanwweiiiii,Bad bad bad,3,27 January 2014,"Completed overrated. No idea how this movie got 7.7 out of 10. The entire movie is filled with typical police movie clichés amplified with totally unnecessary profanes and violence throughout. Oh yeah not to mention the constantly shaking camera work. Zero chemistry between characters. Essentially no plot except for two cops ""policing"" the streets. These had to be the two most unfortunate police officers out there because they've run into gangster war lords, house fire where they all of a sudden became fire fighters, police assaulting perps, human trafficking cartels, annoying feds, sociopathic mass murders, et cetera. The miserable attempt to bring the private lives of the two main characters became distractions that cut into whatever storyline the movie had left. I kept waiting for them to get killed of so that the movie can end, and voilà, finally they were shot at by not one not two not three but four semiautomatic weapons in an open space and no one got shot! Poor Pena had to go at the end because...because your wife just had a baby and you're in a Hollywood movie. And how did Gyllenhaal survive the close range shootings again? No offense to real LAPDs out there.Lastly this has to be one of the worst performance I've seen from Anna Kendrick – not sure what got into her when she chose such a token character. A Master of Science in fluid dynamics? That's not even a real program. I mean you'd have to make an effort to have zero chemistry with Jake Gyllenhaal.

272,stjem05,A great action film,8,29 September 2012,"First, this movie was surprisingly funny. I found myself actually laughing out loud. I was caught off guard because I wasn't expecting it to be so funny but the writers really did a great job on that.This movie will definitely satisfy most action junkies. It didn't go more than 5 minutes without gun violence or the threat of gun violence. There were some great chase scenes and the whole thing had a very ""real"" and ""gritty"" feel. I truly felt like I was in south central LA, minus the sweat and fear I would feel if I was really there. The director really got all of the nuances of the ghetto, and I don't know if the people playing the random bag guys were actors or legitimate thugs they pulled off the street because they were GREAT. They really added to the movie. All of the effort put into little details like that, the way people on the street talk and hold themselves, the secret lives of the gang members, it was all spot on. This coming from someone who actually has lived in rough areas.The main actors did a great job too. They had a great rapport and I wonder if they are good friends now in real life. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the often shaky camera angle. I get that its a style, but it makes me motion sick. Also, the story line itself I think wasn't that developed. It was more of a ""day in the life"" kind of story, where there was not overarching plot, but you got to learn about friendship and life by watching the characters live it. I don't regret the 8 dollars I spent to see it. It was a good movie. Oh but I don't think parents should bring there kids. The amount of cursing was extremely high, more than most movies I have ever seen.",End of Watch
273,phil-johnston3-545-892970,Good/Good Movie,7,3 December 2012,"End of Watch is probably not the movie audiences are expecting. In lieu of a formulaic action/thriller from the man who penned U-571, The Fast and the Furious, Training Day and S.W.A.T audiences are treated with a sinister and intimate thriller about the day to day lives of two cops in south central L.A. Though this is well trodden path for Ayer, End of Watch feels very fresh. Its due in part to two great performances from the leads; Jake Gyllenhaal's maturity as a performer is evident here as he owns the role next to Michael Peña who plays a great second fiddle to him. A lot of the scenes are tight shots of the two as they go about the business of policing and the dialogue is executed really well. The audience quite happily sits and listens to the two friends chat about girls, completely forgetting that the next horrific crime scene is just around the corner. It's a similar dynamic to TNT's Southland and with two quality actors given time and space to own the movie, End of Watch shines. Keep your eye out for the always watchable Anna Kendrick, who is yet to put a foot wrong outside of her cinematic birth in Twilight.But the real star of the show is cinematographer Roman Vasyanov who gambles on heavy reliance on steady cam and wins. The shooting jumps from the various hand-held camcorders held by the cops and the baddies and two chest mounted cameras on the vests of the officers, dragging the audience right into the heart of the action. Point of view shots down the barrel of a gun even get a look in, so the audience is never far away from the action. Resisting the temptation to shy away from this style of filming during the dialogue sequences really pays off as well. As close as we feel to the tension-laden explorations of rundown houses and explosive shoot outs, audience members also feel the safety and security of the bullet-proof police car. Stop/start editing allows for reaction shots in one takes during the natural flow of the dialogue. Ayer wanted this picture to feel ""real"" and the techniques used make this a resounding success.Despite its technical excellence and fantastic performers, End of Watch is sometimes hampered by the script. The villains are fairly obvious and the leads don't evolve throughout the course of the movie to a satisfying extent. By the climax of the picture audience members are still watching the same two guys they met an hour and a half before. Circumstances have changed around them and there's no doubt they're likable characters, but they are static nonetheless. It's a similar movie to 2001's Training Day in many respects, but most prominently here; great actors make a standard script completely enthralling. Viewers will doubtless be divided by the ending. It's certainly not cliché but isn't wholly unexpected either, both of which are good things and should be applauded.Overall, End of Watch is a deeply human, part bromance, part action/thriller with darkness bubbling just under the surface of the friendly, witty dialogue. It keeps you watching during the slow points and puts you on the edge of your seat when the guns come out, which is exactly what you want from a film in this genre.

Unlike the stunning LA Confidential, with a historical story line, End of Watch is done in the cinema ver'ite' style - in a realistic real cops on duty in the LA war zone frame. The casting in this movie is picture perfect, with each actor giving in depth performances.The story line brings the Mexican / US drug problem into crystal clarity.

The message of this movie: It is honorable to die for your brothers of the law. The problem is this message is portrayed in a very simplistic and shallow manner.What is honorable about dying for your brothers of law when you're leaving your wife and new child behind? The two cops only question this once during the film after they went into the burning building, and it's touched on so lightly that I almost forgot they even did this.They're actions would have been honorable if they consciously thought about their families before putting themselves in these dangerous situations. It can be honorable to put your needs of yourself and family aside for the greater good of society to do your job but, besides the time I mentioned above, this doesn't happen. Instead these two cops get into these dangerous situations without really even thinking, and moreso because they feel like their bada**es for being these allstar cops who are at the top of their game controlling crime in the ghetto.There attitude is extremely immature and they act like little boys with their responsibility.

Unfortunately, if you're expecting an action-packed movie based upon the synopsis then you will clearly be disappointed as I was. I just finished watching the movie and I'm upset by the false and misleading synopsis since this movie is simply a buddy-cop movie (and more character driven than anything else). In fact, the action behind the synopsis does NOT take place until the last 10 minutes of the movie. Consequently, had I been told that this movie was a buddy-cop movie that details the lives of two LA cops as they perform their police duties, then I would have looked elsewhere.As a buddy-cop movie it wasn't bad, but when you're expecting the movie to be centered on a Mexican drug cartel chasing and pursuing two cops (and hence all the action that would have entailed), it leaves you bitterly disappointed and upset.In short, if the producers behind this movie had really stuck to the advertised synopsis, that would have been a far more interesting and engaging film than this one.",End of Watch

The relationship between officer Taylor and Zavala is developed very strongly and successfully, allowing the viewers to easily connect to the character and submerge in their own personal lives. The realistic part not only comes from Gyllenhaals and Penas ability to nail their roles (they really did) but the mix of first person shots and a few wide angles. The use of these are not like Cloverfield, Battle LA, or Paranormal Activity, the POV shot in this film with their moments parallel the story ( meaning they are fast when in needs to be fast and slow when it calls for it) and also allows the establishment of the setting, which is very hard to do in POV.

283,ClutchandMikemovies,One of the Best Cop Movies Ever,9,7 October 2012,"""End of Watch"" is not only one of the best cop movies ever made, its one of the best buddy movies ever made. To be honest, my expectations were quite low going to see this. The previews made it looks like a found footage movie in the buddy cop genre, but it actually turned out to be much more. First off, I have to commend ""End of Watch"" for not sticking directly to the point of view camera style. That technique has been beaten into the ground so much in recent movies that, quite frankly, I'm sick of it. Instead, ""End of Watch"" uses the point of view camera for moments that need to capture the realism that it offers. Other scenes are shown from the perspective of a third party narration that gives the film a nice smooth flow. Secondly, this movie doesn't fall into the problem that similar movies have: it has some great comedic relief. Sometimes a too serious of a movie is really nothing more than a let down, but ""End of Watch"" does a great job of mixing the humor of the two cops as well as some true grit action.I guess I should mention something about the plot, but this movie is more of a free roaming look at two officers in the L.A.P.D. than it is a plot driven story. The two cops Brian ( Jake Gyllenhaal) and Mike ( Michael Pena) joined the force together and consider each other brothers. The main story of the movie involves them digging deeper and deeper into the cartel in Los Angeles. But the movie is much more about the two cops than anything else. It does a great job of slipping in their back story and making their close friendship very believable. There isn't a bad acted scene in the movie and all of the action is very intense. There are some tough to watch scenes, the film doesn't stray away from trying to capture the brutality that these kinds of officers would see on a day to day basis.Like I said before, this is one of the best cop movies ever made. It is impossible to walk out of the theater without a new found respect for the officers who put their lives on the line. (As cliché as that sounds, you go see it and tell me I'm wrong.) This one of the best movies I have seen this year. If gritty cop dramas sounds like something your into, then this is my top recommendation.Check out more of our reviews at www.clutchandmikemovies.blogspot.com",End of Watch
284,jordanlujan7,Pretty good cop movie with a heart,7,7 October 2012,"I enjoyed this movie quite a bit, but just a couple things;The Good: Well paced. Decent plot. Micheal Pena was a great comic relief. Solid performance from Anna Kendrick, surprisingly enough. Liked that the first quarter of the movie was like the show ""Cops"" and the main characters never got explanations for the things they saw (Example: Kids tied up in the closet) and I feel like that showed why Taylor needed to investigate the way he did later on in the film. The Bad: My father is a cop and they Never call each other ""partner"", always first or last name (He said no one on the force ever calls their partners ""partner""). Micheal Pena left much to be desired in the acting department. Somethings that bugged me (Personal/Not necessarily ""Bad"" per say): During the final shootout, two AK-47s spray into Zavala who is kneeling, only covering 1/5ths of Taylor, but not one stray bullet hits Taylor? At least one person in both gangs recorded everything with camcorders, but not just camcorders, HD camcorders. <-(What was that about?) Didn't really buy that whole ""I'm in a video elective class"" thing. What was the point of the fight between Zavala and the gang guy? Zavala and Taylor are supposed to be good friends, yet they call each other ""partner""? Jake just is not a very believable cop to me (I think they shaved his head to make him look more intimidating/masculine, but it didn't work).Overall a good film even though it may seem like I didn't like it because the Bad/bugged me sections are bigger than the Good, I did.",End of Watch
285,in-rainbows-2010,Excellent ride along,8,18 October 2012,"(More like an 8.2 in my books)From the trailer, I had my doubts about this film. I was wrong. Its excellent.There are small,minor problems. -In terms of telling a story, I felt nothing significant was gained. -The antagonists' motivations were a bit unclear. -The reasoning for the use of the cameras was a bit hokey. (Though the use was really effective) -I also felt like a lot of 'crazy' stuff happened to this one particular cop duo. Again, small stuff.But as an experience, amazing. As an a viewer, I felt entirely immersed into these guys' lives. Gyllenhaal and Pena had amazing chemistry on screen. The supporting cast was excellent. (Grillo, Horn, Ferrera)",End of Watch
286,mofodojo2010,Pathetic at best,1,22 January 2013,"This movie was one of the most mangled pieces of garbage I think I have 
 ever seen. I actually almost wish that I was speaking in hyperbole. I 
 was so insanely bored by ""found footage"" of some loser cop's college 
 class project that I would rather have watched a documentary on the 
 history of drinking straws. The movie is basically about two cops that 
 do nothing but goof around, break protocol, and act like the low-lifes 
 that they are trying to uproot. Not only is half of the movie 
 unrealistic, such as ignoring a government agent's orders to leave the 
 gang that they are dealing with alone, buts it is saturated with 
 stereotypes that are hyperbolas themselves. The ""gangsters"" in this 
 film talk like they are actors in a porno. Almost every line of 
 dialogue that they utter is laced with f-bombs. Don't get me wrong 
 cussing happens a lot in many people's lives and occupations, but to 
 the point where literally every other word is f**k is annoying. There 
 is a particular seen where some of the gang-bangers are talking about 
 killing the cops and it sounds somewhat like this, ""Dude, F, we are 
 f-ing gonna f these f-ers up f-ing forever f-ing even f-ing if we have 
 to f-ing f those f-ers 'til they're f-ed so much that f-ing their f-ing 
 mom will be f-ing skull f-ing them to f-ing bring their f-ing f's back 
 to f-ing life. F bro. I'm f-ing serious. F. F. F I F-ing love you."" And 
 this kind of dialogue happens at least three times for what seems like 
 10 minutes each scene. The fact that the gangsters are filming 
 themselves is one of the dumbest things because most of the recordings 
 are of them talking about committing crimes and killing the cops. I'd 
 love to see the court case after the fact where 300 hours of 
 incriminating footage had been recovered as evidence to put these 
 idiots down. That might almost make a better movie than this one. Then 
 there is the other stuff that all the other bad reviews have mentioned. 
 The acting is terrible. And no I do not believe that Gyllenhal and Pena 
 saved this movie. It is the worst film that either of them has been in. 
 Also many of the reviewers are right; these cops would have died 
 horrible deaths with as many bullets that were supposedly being shot at 
 them. The fact that cops would be portrayed like this, even though I 
 hate cops, it is disrespectful to all who serve for the police forces 
 in America. I can't even think of any redeeming qualities for this 
 film. If I could I would give it a zero. The only part of the film 
 where I may have smiled in joy is when one of these loser cops kicks 
 the bucket but then they ruin the movie again by letting his partner 
 live and sob into his chest. I'm actually surprised he didn't kiss him 
 goodbye. My movie theatre has a ""no refund policy"" and therefore I sat 
 and kept praying the movie would somehow get better or at least just 
 end. It is really sad that stuff like this can get released in 
 theatres, get good reviews, and steal my money all in one day. I've 
 practically stopped seeing movies for the first two weeks because 
 that's how long you usually have to wait for the honest reviews to 
 emerge.",End of Watch
287,axiomatic-paradigm,Confusing but entertaining,7,13 November 2012,"I should probably start off by saying that this is my first review on IMDb but i rely on these to figure out which movies are worth watching as opposed to those that shouldn't be watched. To an extent, i can appreciate the unique cinematography in this film that always gives the viewers this first person aspect. The reason behind it was supposedly because the two protagonists were outfitted with some kind of pocket video recorder and mr gyllenhall had a hd cam that he carried around with him during his adventures. Kind of like the blair with project meets training day. The problem with this comes in 2 different flavours: 1 - the Spanish gang of antagonists was also accompanied by a hd camera (with night vision), which i found actually sucked the realism out of the film. 2 - there were a number of camera angles that neither of the pocket cams or the hd cam, or the night vision hd cam that the bad guys had, could account for. This took away from the movie because of that nauseating ""shaky camera"" affect that didn't really have any business being there if none of the cameras were providing the viewpoint. I could see a number of scenes in the movie where the camera just did not fit. In short, if you're looking for a gangland shootem up style movie. Watch this. If you're looking for substance, pay closer attention to the character development. I prefer to not play wheres waldo with the plot though.",End of Watch

I really enjoyed watching this original well-made piece of art. One of the officers is doing a lot of video for a class which adds to the creativity of the motion picture. This isn't your typical cops and robbers cinema where you can predict the outcomes. So be prepared for a lot of fresh, imaginative, action packed and suspenseful scenes. The relationships between the officers and the citizens is realistic and the actors do a good job of being realistic. Nothing is overdone to try and make you like or hate any of the characters.There are some shots in their off-duty activities which seem boring but that just adds to the realism of this extremely well-made movie.",End of Watch
289,chrisduce-101-409464,The sum is not better than all its parts.,6,15 January 2016,"While the acting is generally quite good, the characters are mostly contrived and clichéd and none of them feels particularly real or relatable, which detracts from the overall feel of the movie. Add to this the fact that the movie has tried too hard to be too many things to too many people, it has ended up being a mash-up of conflicting and competing styles that lacks substance and conviction.Firstly, using a documentary style for this type of movie does not help the flow and generally gets in the way of effective story telling. While it allows a ""fly on the wall"" glimpse into the private moments of the films characters, there is nothing that could not have been covered with standard shooting practices, however a lot of the scenes jump from one style to the other and I spent a significant part of the film trying to work out which was which. This ruined the flow of the film and made it feel artificial.Also, the film did not know what it wanted to be, whether it was a gangster movie, a buddy-cop movie, a documentary, or a commentary on social order. Most of the characters were over-the-top clichés and again this made it feel more like a Hollywood production than a real life drama. The movie covered almost every stereotype in the cop vs gangster play-book and while it did try and take it to another level, it always came back to the standard base of goodies vs baddies for the sake of a shoot-out. It could have offered a lot more.There were some very good moments, some strong acting performances and several riveting scenes, but the sum of all these parts did not come together to provide a memorable and poignant movie experience. This movie felt more like several episodes of a telemovie put together to make a feature film. It would have been far more enjoyable and engaging as a 6 part mini series.",End of Watch

This is probably the best police movie i have ever seen its definitely right up there with (colors) as a true account of things that have happened and a story of brotherhood this is a great movie. This is a great movie for any cop or military personnel to see. for a basis on the tactical feel of things being present in this movie you can tell a difference of the two main characters in the movie . Brian Taylor who is a former marine is much more aggressive and agile than his counterpart who has never been in the military. you specifically see this when they are ambushed inside the apartment complex and when they run down the alley together and hop the gate Taylor shoots one of cartel members sitting in his car in the face, you then hear Savalla say i think you killed that guy bro Taylor calmly replies good. Taylor's split second decision making and hyper vigilance saved them on more than one occasion.

294,culturedleftpeg,"Fast, flowing, stylish buddy cop movie",7,5 December 2012,"Written and directed by David Ayer, writer of The Fast and the Furious, Training Day and S.W.A.T., End of Watch is best described as a buddy cop movie. When I say buddy cop movie, try not to think of Beverly Hills Cops or 48 Hours. In fact, completely forget all about Eddie Murphy – like most of Hollywood has. Ayer's End of Watch is a gritty, realistic and honest view of the everyday life of two LAPD street cops, played by Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko, Brokeback Mountain, Jarhead) and Michael Pena (Shooter, The Lincoln Lawyer, Eastbound & Down). The film focuses on the brother-like relationship of the two leads, as they get in over their heads with a local cartel.So, as mentioned, the film follows Brian (Gyllenhaal) and Mike (Pena) as they go about their normal, everyday business, documenting their work life and, at times, their personal life. The story with the two is that they came through the training academy together and have been partners, and friends, ever since. They are shown going through the normal procedures of an LAPD street cop, such as being called out to house calls, completing paperwork, attending briefings, pulling over cars and even, at one point, rescuing some children from a flaming building. After safely getting everybody out of said flaming building, the pair are given the Medal of Valor as an acknowledgement of their work. The two find themselves asking each other whether they 'feel like a hero' now; to which they decide that they want more, particularly Gyllenhaal's Brian. They decide that they don't just want to be street cops, they want to take down bigger fish. Before they know it, they've confiscated money and guns from a local cartel, not to mention accidentally unearthing a human trafficking racket. In the process, they've put a huge bullseye on both of their backs.Ayer uses a mixture of shooting techniques to capture the essence of his story. A lot of the film is shot in a typically cinematic style, but, at times, found footage techniques are incorporated to give a real feel to the events that unfurl. For example, the film often shows footage from the police cameras that are fixed to police cars or from a personal video camera that Brian seemingly always carries with him. Brian's footage is how a lot of the more personal life footage is shot, showing the two leads spending a lot of time with each other outside of their work in the force. The relationship between Brian and Mike is brilliantly captured, with you fully believing that the pair are prepared to put their lives on the line for each other. The chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Pena is fantastic and utterly believable. Both actors put in a great performance, with the rest of the cast being fleshed out by the likes of Natalie Martinez, Anna Kendrick, David Harbour and Frank Grillo. All of the characters shine, but, again, this is down to their interactions with the film's two leads. You find yourself caring about the relationship that each of the leads have with their partners, but that's because you've heard these partners discussed so much by Brian and Mike. The supporting cast are all great in their roles, but it's the standout performances of, and the relationship between, Gyllenhaal and Pena that is the glue to the piece. Even when the characters are on patrol, they're talking about things that friends talk about, telling jokes, mocking each other, discussing women and generally just bouncing off each other. There's literally five, maybe ten, minutes during the film that the two aren't together. You never once feel that these two are work colleagues, more friends that happen to work together. The film itself is not so much a story, more a tale of what it is that cops go through on a daily basis. There's not the usual sort of narrative associated with these films, although there is still a clear direction that the story takes. The film leaves questions unanswered, it doesn't give the viewer exactly what they want or expect, but it's a great depiction of what it is like to be a normal, everyday street cop. Everything that happens on the screen is an important piece of the puzzle. Not because all events prove to be vital as the film builds to it's climax, but because they help the viewer to see the larger picture. Whilst the highlight of the film is all about two cops that are like brothers, with the focus of the film almost acting as a character piece for the two, there is still plenty of action for those that crave it. As well as the heart of the story, there's fast paced car chases, there's shoot outs and there's some gruesome and intense violence at times. Make no mistake, End of Watch is an intense actioner when it chooses to be.I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed End of Watch, although I can appreciate that it may not be for everyone. It doesn't run like a normal cop movie. It's not the same as a Training Day or a S.W.A.T.; it's got more heart to it, more emotional investment. The last third of the film will divide audiences, as there's no glamorous Hollywood climax, there's no special effects extravaganza - there's just a heartfelt, sudden, if not a tad predictable, end to a story of two brothers. Whilst it may not appeal to everyone, End of Watch impressed me no end. For that reason, I'll give it a strong 7 out of 10.",End of Watch

Ayer uses just enough shaky-cam to ensure the audience believes in their protagonists, played with a great amount of charisma and believable brotherly affection by Jake Gyllenaal and Michael Peña, and to create a real sense of inevitable and unpredictable violence around every street corner. The film's unwielding use of brutal violence and gore at key moments - including a police officer with a knife stuck in his eye and mutilated bodies found in an abandoned house - mixed with the cheery and fraternal atmosphere between the partners creates a distinctly strange and unpredictable vibe to this brilliant film.",End of Watch
296,doctirderp,"its a decent movie, but i wouldn't trust the score.",5,4 December 2017,"as far as buddy cop movies go, this is pretty average. there are far better movies of this genre which have more compelling plot, characters and dialogue. the best part of this movie would be the relationship between the two main characters, and it is a really good duo. they have great and realistic charisma, but even so the individual characters lack any development or substance. most the time which could have been used to develop the characters, it needlessly interjected their wives and girlfriends. i get thats a major part of life, but those people are irrelevant to the story. you really don't know who either one of these guys are on their own.the plot is pretty dumb, and thats quite generous. like in the beginning the hispanic cop just fights a suspected criminal because he got heated over an offhanded comment. its really dumb, especially like when i said before there is no character development so it's not really believable the cop would behave like that in the first place. if that happened in another movie, where they established the cop was hotheaded, it would be different...but they don't, so it comes off as really forced and stupid. a lot of this movie's plot suffers from that, especially the criminals. the antagonists are forced to play a very one dimensional stereotype of the hispanic gangbanger, so their personalities aren't convincing either. the plot just reinforces it, and by the end it's just extremely tired.so, as far as a decent movie goes, yeah...its decent. its just not that great either.",End of Watch

Acting - sufficient chemistry between the lead guys to be believable, and now, here is the superb part, this duo makes you care about them. The smirks, the dancing, the composure all validate a partnership that is essential towards the plot. Coherent. Direction - this is BIG. It is easy to turn in another Blair witch overload, but the direction of hand-held cam here is very well done. You can tell it is intentional to do every scene with a little shake here and a little gag there. It is Not choppy but a very fluent motion altogether, like your farm cousin speaking perfect English but with a latino accent. Fights - this is one major gripe I have about this movie because it really could use more action and more fights. It is a good movie, but as a guy movie, more fights are always appreciated. Overall, EOW is a movie in the genre of Collateral, Miami vice, Heat, etc. This is not just another Training day spin-off, but a tender attempt at making something that stabs your heart and leave your eyes watering over such tenderness.",End of Watch
298,rangerdelraval,What a disappointment,5,21 January 2017,"I'd never expect a movie rated as a 7'7 by IMDb users to be such a disappointment. I like the topic, so as soon as I saw that 7'7 I didn't hesitate and pressed the start button. And the first 30 minutes of the movie were OK, and I really liked the concept of the cop vlogging about his daily life, as well as the bad guys recording themselves while doing their ""bad guys stuff"", and the street flavor when patrolling the less glamorous part of L.A. But then, as we know more about the main characters, their idyllic relationship, lives, wives, girlfriends, and the escalation of heroic scenes goes on, the lesser and lesser realistic the story gets, and therefore, the more it goes down hill.

301,nick_white_5,"Likable, believable characters make this a realistically funny, intense and emotionally gripping cop movie.",8,10 September 2012,"When I actually sit down and think about it, there aren't many good movies about your average, every day police officer. There are a couple notable television series', like ""Hill Street Blues"" and the now dated but oddly fascinating reality series ""Cops"", but on film, these guys don't get a lot of luck. I guess everyone would rather see movies about undercover officers or detectives. Well for anyone like me who's been waiting for it, here it is. End Of Watch, an excellent take on the genre. It may not be perfect, but it's unique and shows the day to day life more effectively than most if any cop movies I've seen, and as such I think it will one day be essential viewing for fans of the genre.In the film we meet Brian Taylor, an ex-marine working as a police officer while he works his way through law school. He also just so happens to be taking a class in filmmaking and is filming his experiences to make a documentary for said class, and this is where we get much of our view into the film from. Featured frequently in the film is his partner Mike, often called Z. After stumbling upon a drug-lord at a routine traffic stop, they quickly fall into trouble with the cartel and have to fight their way through it while still trying to figure out where it's all coming from.The great thing about this mockumentary/found footage style isn't so much the way it's able to present the action of being a cop realistically (which it does but so do normally shot movies), but it better gives us an understanding of what happens inbetween the action. Being a fly on the wall in the various dull, inappropriate, and often times hilarious conversations the two have when patrolling brings the film a much needed dose of comic relief, but the kind that never feels forced. It's all set up naturally. This really gives a chance for stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena to shine as well as they fit so naturally into these characters, often sounding unscripted whether or not they are. They play them as regular guys instead of complex characters which may make them a little less compelling, but all the more fun to watch.The film also mixes in a variety of other video sources from the dashboard cams of the police cruisers to security cameras. This really benefits the style as a whole. 99% of the time, using the self-shot, found footage for an entire film can come off as gimmicky and unnecessary, but by using a variety of sources the director is able to keep the realistic tone consistent while downplaying the gimmick idea and instead choosing to use Brian's self shot footage and monologues to the camera only when they prove most effective to the story.Along the way the film is also interspersed with subplots of Brian meeting his new girl Janet, played by Anna Kendrick who makes a memorable impression despite her little screen time, as well as Z and his wife having a baby. While I find it hard to really complain about Anna Kendrick (she's just so damn cute! And she looked stunning on stage introducing the film), these subplots, while important for character development, are thrown in a little too randomly throughout and mess with the overall flow of the film. It's not a huge complaint as I've seen it done worse in other movies, but it could've been solved with some tighter editing. But who knows, this was the premiere I saw, studios still often tweak movies before wide-release.Fortunately for writer/director David Ayer, this is really the only complaint I have about the film. The entire movie is fairly well written. I did find the dialogue of a lot of the street thugs to be cliché and racially stereotypical, but the things Brian and Z say are priceless throughout and help you deal with a lot of the more serious scenes, and there are quite a few of them. For as entertaining and light-hearted as it is at times, End Of Watch has many dark, brutally violent, and emotionally impacting scenes that are not for the feint of heart. They do ultimately seem necessary though as the film needs action to keep it going, and to create the realistic document of day to day police life it's trying to create, which does get pretty brutal sometimes despite the mostly mundane times in between. The important thing though is that the film is able to balance all of these moments so well.David Ayer has dedicated what seems to be his whole career to police movies. Most are mediocre to bad (Street Kings), some are genre classics (Training Day), but I think End Of Watch is by far his finest. It easily has the most likable characters, and as such the most emotional involvement for the audience, which thus creates the most tension in the high risk, action scenes. It has the most believable story of any of his movies, or most cop movies for that matter, and lastly it just told in an interesting way. Neither the cop story, found footage action or fly on the wall comedy genres are anything new, but End of Watch takes old ideas and fits them together to make something interesting.In conclusion, it's tough to go wrong with End Of Watch if you're a fan of the genre. Even if you're not particularly fond of cop movies, I'd still recommend it. It's a highly entertaining, tension filled ride of a movie. It may not be as deep as some other movies coming out now, but it really brings you into another world well. It's well written, well directed, well acted, and was well enjoyed by the whole crowd. Check it out.",End of Watch

303,kcrider91,If you're looking for a cop drama with an actual story line look no further!!!,8,10 February 2013,"I have always loved documentaries and the stories and points they portray. I knew going into this movie that it would use the same cinematography style as Cloverfield, all the Paranormal movies, and Southland. However, even with a roles filled by stars as big as Jake Gyllenhaal, Anna Kendrick, and Micheal Peña I still found myself glued to the screen as if I was watching another documentary. I've watched the Television show Southland since it started its first episode. In the first 5 minutes it felt like watching an extension of that show. Jake and Micheal's characters, Brian and Mike, are average people trying to make a deference on the LA streets. This movie is not just a pointless cop drama with lots of action. This film has the story that keeps you wanting more, the action that keeps you at the edge of your seat, the drama that make it a memorable movie, and the comedy that makes you laugh your ass off.Once you start watching you'll be pulled to the edge of your seat and hangout there the for the entire movie. My only complaints is first the language used. I don't take offense to foul language at all I just found it hard to understand some of the characters because of their foul language. My only other complaint is the massive time jumps between the action. It leaves you just a bit confused. These are just little details and in no way affect the plot line of the movie.From here on is a basic summary of the plot line... So SPOILER ALERT:Like any LAPD cop drama the underlying storyline is the Mexican drug cartels pushing drugs into LA. In a deferent style, however, the main characters Mike and Brain accidentally stumble upon the main heads of the American side of the cartel.It starts by them going to shut down a party that allows them to meat the head honcho himself. The next time they step into the cartel's spot light is when they pull over a car running money and weapons for the cartel. After this Brian and Mike start to go out of their way to try and bring in more cartel members and drug runners. This lands them into trouble with a group of Federal officers who are trying to keep an eye on these cartel members to hopeful bring them down one day. The officer tells Mike and Brian to lay low for a but and get off the cartels radar. They do this and start to lay off the cartel members. During a routine welfare check they accidentally stumble upon what appears to be a house the cartel use to store drugs and torture and bury dead bodies. Again they are thrust back onto the cartel's radar and the cartel puts a hit out on them. On what appears to be a routine traffic stop the cartel acts out their hit. As Mike and Brian shot their way out of the trap they find themselves in an alley where Brian is shot but we don't know how bad it truly is. As Mike is trying to help, waiting on back up, and calling out for help the cartel come to finish the job and brutally guns down Mike and leaves the partners their to rot in the street. As the hit squad walks off the rest of the cops show up and kill the hit squad.The next scene is at a funeral where we find out Brian survived but is severely injured and they are attending Mike's funeral. In true mocumentary style the movie then ends on a scene of the partners in the squad car telling a funny story.",End of Watch
304,roach5409,Great Overall Movie,9,9 July 2013,"I was a little skeptical about watching this movie at first. I had heard it was shot from the view of hand-held cameras. The reason this made me skeptical was because Chronicle was also shot through the view of hand-held cameras. Now don't get me wrong, Chronicle was a good movie, but the way it was shot was not appealing to the eye. After watching the movie, I must say that it turned out to be a lot better filmed then I had expected. My heart was pounding through most of the scenes. It was a great rush. Towards the end I was trying to predict the end(as most people do in all films), and I was stunned by what had happened. You would assume that both cops would survive, but you were left stunned when both had been shot with Mike(Pena) laying on top of Brian(Gyllenhaal). Then comes the funeral, and you are once again stunned to find out that Brian ha survived. It doesn't seem unreal because he was only shot once, while Mike was shot many times. At the funeral you are left heart-broken for Brian, and also Mike's wife. The movie ends in the greatest way this movie could have possibly ended. With a flashback to the day of the shooting. It leaves you laughing, and overall with a smile. You can only imagine that Brian would take care of Mike's wife and child as he had promised Brian that he would.Overall I really enjoyed this movie. By far one of the best movies I have seen in a while.",End of Watch
305,garyatcable,excellent film that keeps your attention through out,10,3 September 2014,The 2 lead actors in this film where great and had a realistic male bonding chemistry feel to it. The unique camera action made you feel as if you where there with them and the story just moved along nicely taking you with it.At first I did not think I would like this film as the first person camera style is usually not to my liking but I stuck with it and in no time I was completely submerged in the film rooting for the 2 cops against the gangsters.I would thoroughly recommend this film to anyone who like to watch the friendships that men can create with each in their shared dangerous occupation and personal lives.The film was that good it moved me to give my first film review which I score at a 10. Watch this film you will not be disappointed,End of Watch
306,WillyWhitby,Not quite cop film of the century but still brilliant,8,28 November 2012,"Judging from the trailer this appeared to be the cop film of the century being explosive and action-packed, however I got a different experience from it, but nevertheless it was a pleasing result.End Of Watch follows the close relationship between two policemen Brian Taylor (Jake Gylennhaal) and Mike Zavala (Michael Pena) who are members of the LAPD fighting the underground of Los Angelas' renowned gangland criminals. But when they get on the wrong side of a notorious cartel within the city it comes with explosive and dangerous consequences. Both supporting families the film follows the experience of the two cops in their eventful day to day lives, as well as their intimate relationship with their families but also the close and entertaining comrade with each other. But do the good guys always win? The great points of the film are the close and private camera angles used in it. Gyleenhaal's character constantly carries round a camcorder capturing their rounds for some unknown project he's having so the close up shots and special movement within the 'cop cam' makes you feel like the 3rd person in the situation and much improves the occasional gruesome and tense moment within the movie. Another good aspect and probably the best thing about the movie is you stay entirely with the two protagonists (Taylor and Zavala) and you grow to love their characters and like them as people throughout, you see the powerful relationship between them grow and with touching moments of personal issues but mainly the friendly banter you have between friends of your own, so in like any good movie you're raring for them to win.There is only one bad point I've found of it and that it does take a very long time to get into the story as you follow the duo into various 'day to day' police jobs which make you respect the job of the police more, because of the adventurous things that they encounter everyday. But also the director/writer David Ayer decides to make a prominent feature of the family life of the two being involved which once again is touching to see that the police are just like you and I in their personal lives. To be honest it all ends a bit too quickly for my liking and you expect some more twists and turns, but I imagine Ayer decided to do that just to enhance the unpredictability of the policeman's job.Overall it was a good film to watch with excellent and real performances by Gylennhaal and Pena and arguably one of the best films Pena has been in his own career. Brilliant writing courtesy of Ayer. Doesn't quite live up the accolade of 'best cop movie' but it's definitely up there of those of recent years but it's not quite the must-see of the year..

307,frizzlemonkeys,Action packed with some great writing,8,23 November 2012,"Was looking forward to watching the film for a while and it didn't disappoint. The chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Pena is truly believable, they work well at giving the audience a sense of belief about the characters making them real.I think the film works well without a definitive plot, Ayer is truly going for a film that follows the life of a police partnership the idea of using an ongoing visible narrative i believe would take away from what the film is trying to portray. In a real life situation real police officers wouldn't have a story they would go through they would do their job as they are asked and this is how this film should be viewed not as a thrilling story about heroism and courage but as a film that shows the real heart of officers and real life situations.the script in itself i believe is very well written Ayer really writes in a way that connects the characters throughout the film the other characters add to it bit by bit but the film is made when its only Pena and Gyllenhaal. Their dialogue really pulls the audience in and keeps them watching from start to finish.Although the other characters are a necessity to the film the reason it didn't get higher is due to some slack performances from other members of the cast, i could see myself starting to loose interest for a second when Kendrick was on screen and that let the film slip slightly but my attention was always returned when the two main actors were back.Overall a very good film great opening and ending as well as some action packed scene intertwined with some really good acting and writing from the director and main actors.

Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena were extremely dedicated to their roles and as a result were very believable as good friends; they actually reminded me of my best friend and myself. I usually find myself liking cop movies OK, but never see them as anything spectacular, and there are some scenes that I felt ran by too slow, but that's frankly the only complaint I have on the film. Everything else about it is pure gold! The acting, the directing, the atmosphere, and especially the ending.

Also, the writing is amazingly robotic and cliche at most of the time, but it leaves space for one of the only good aspects in the film: the chemistry between the protagonists, that would make me forget the freakshow I was watching for some three scenes. This wouldn't be possible without Jake and Peña at the main roles, but don't be fooled, at most of the time, the acting is just hilarious. Everyone is stereotyped, exagerated and lifeless at some point.In short, ""End of Watch"" is horrible. But, I have to be honest, it actually entertained me. I don't know if I was just having a tough day and anything I would pop up at Prime Video would be better than going to sleep, but the first 30 minutes amused me by the bad characters, bad lines and bad camera work.

It added a rawness that a law enforcement movie calls for. I just think there was a lot unexplored in the movie's climax/ending. This movie is average. Actors did a great job overall with the script they were given. The lackluster ending just makes the first parts of the movie pointless.
*spoiler*When there was law enforcement footage of the hit going down on both cops I expected to be a follow up as to why. Was it corruption? How high did the corruption go? Why didn't the cop that survived follow up with the amount of time it took for the calvary to show up? The higher ups were obviously in on it since their surveillance was used in showing the audience the green light. The cops had great chemistry and kept calling themselves brothers, you would expect a desire to follow up once you lose your partner after a lack of urgency between the other law enforcement officers. I feel overall the ending was lazy. The gangsters (who used f bombs as much as the took a breath) literally didn't even try to run, they had so much time to leave and bail which would of made more sense. Have some get away and make it an investigation, partially participated by the surviving cop...? But no. They just start shooting as if they're in a video game. Idk great movie, better idea overall. I just wish they executed the ending better. Or at least did something more original with it!",End of Watch

317,ddhyatt,More Hollywood fantasy,5,6 September 2013,"More Hollywood ignorance and PC fantasy. No decent cop could like this movie. Unlike the people ignorance of guns, cops, etc. this is not ""realistic"". Retards do not make good cops. You do not miss someone at 50 yards with an ak47, let alone a full auto ak47, let alone 3 full auto ak47's. You do no shoot across your forearm, it limits your mobility and it is dangerous under rapid fire. You do not stand their talking to the police while pointing guns at them...they will shoot you. You do not trade insults while pointing guns at each other, then decide to finally chamber your shotgun and start shooting. You do not point your shotgun in the air to chamber it, you chamber it while aiming.I could go on, but if you don't get what I am saying than you don't know anything about guns, being a cop, etc. either.On the plus side, the story was OK, and the acting was good. The execution was extremely poor though.

This was honestly the first COP drama I've watched since I left the academy 15 years ago. The reason I don't like most COP dramas is because the pot smoking, liberal, Fly-over, Hollywood writers try to get it right but they just don't live in the same world as most COPS (or the rest of us), so they don't recognize when their writing goes wrong and the story starts to ring hollow. This movie at least didn't really seem to try and reminded me a lot of Jar Heads, ""In the ball park but not real"".

319,AsirenYen,Great police recruitment video,3,29 November 2012,"End of Watch is a simple, heavy-handed law-enforcement recruitment video.The movie opens with a manly voice-over announcing that the policeman is there to Do His Duty. It matters not if you or he agrees with the law, if you break it, it is his duty to uphold it.The premise for the headache-inducing shaky-reality-cam is that ""Brian"", Jake Gyllenhaal's character, is ""doing a project"". Cameras are then occasionally declared, such as the clip-on cams both main characters are wearing and a camcorder that Brian is seen to carry around with him, but random angles are then added to ""add"" to the action (such as a POV that points back at Brian from the end of a rifle during a chase scene).The script is heavy-handed in its depiction of ""good"" and ""bad"". An early disagreement between the pair and a ""hoodlum"" is put forward as showing that there can be respect even though there are differences. An easy way to spot the bad guys is by the constant stream of profanity they spew forth, f-ing this and f-ing that wherever they go. No break, no background, they turn up, they swear, they shoot.The storyline itself makes little sense, and is purely for the glorification of the main characters. The escalation of the busts from the random stop'n'search to the abandoned, slaughtered holding pen that results in them being put on a hit-list makes no sense (especially as the last one was an anon tip-off). The ensuing chase and conclusion was linear and predictable, with most of the action already shown in the various trailers.The movie deliberately finishes on an anecdote from Mike so that viewers leave on a happy note and take away a positive experience, rather than the heavy, powerful ending that should have had had it ended with the funeral, with which it should have if there was any artistic merit to the movie.In conclusion, I expect police enforcement applications to increase on the back of this movie, especially those characters that failed to get into the army from applying after watching The Hurt Locker.",End of Watch

For starters I hate shaky camera work as it induces headaches and adds nothing to make the movie more watchable or more authentic/credible, and cops making a documentary with a camera while on duty, come on lets get real here!!. It is laughable to see a cop with a camera in his one hand and his gun in the other going after hardened criminals with sub-machine guns, who coincidently hate cops to their guts. What's even more laughable is when a woman cop is in stress and calls for help through the police radio, and our heroes get in there the first thing they see is a male officer sitting on the sidewalk with a knife fully embedded into his right eye (and certainly all the way to his brain), giving directions to them as nothing really serious happened to him, and his remarks about his own situation while he is transported to the ambulance is something to be heard to be believed (talk about bad acting). Then there is the scene were our two sidekicks were showered by machine gun bullets by not one but - get this - 4 different criminals without taking a serious hit. Then the gangsters almost having a party after they kill (or think that they did) our heroes, taking it slowly with their SMG on their shoulders moving around like cowboys with no hurry to leave the crime scene and then get shot by incoming police officers like flies without even being able to return a shot.....Shot in documentary style... says IMDb.. I love documentaries for their true to life aspect, but this movie ain't one of them.

Many reviews say that there's no point/story, but what is the point of real police work... daily accounts of stops and go's, shoot outs and traffic stops. As someone who is close to police work and stressful situations, this film does very well at both the seriousness and the shenanigans that people with high stress jobs deal with. This film will never be a documentary but will always be an amazing view of storytelling by someone who has never been in that situation. The banter and playfulness of these characters is real. The seriousness is real. The film is as real as Hollywood allows. My opinion is the movie is an 8 of 10. It is real in Hollywood standards.

The fine line between entertainment and reality can be, and almost always is, held in the eye of the beholder. If a viewer happens to be employed in the field that the story line is depicting, many times he/she will be asked ""is it really like that?"". Very rarely will the answer be yes. Other than the feeble attempt at being a docudrama, End of Watch covers the gambit of great story telling. It will hold your attention, familiarize you with the characters and have Angelino's straining their brains to place the venue's that the action takes place. I feel that the element of realism depicting the antagonists was not over the top, but rather perfectly stated.

I'll qualify my opinion by stating now I'm a cop (not in LA), and the buddy aspect of the partnership between the two main characters was one of the most realistic depictions of how police officers relate I've come across on screen. One reviewer stated that their in car antics were not what they expected of tough LAPD cops - I can vouch that the in car banter between partners is generally the crudest and most puerile in nature. I can't explain it, perhaps it's a way of releasing tension, but when you're in your car and not actively engaged in driving at speed, responding or chasing etc, its your little world. As soon as you're in public, it's on with the ""game face"" and up with your guard. As for the rest of the movie, I found it impactive, in fact a little uncomfortable at times. Having been shot at (only on one occasion, thankfully) it's amazing how one can escape unscathed - so I wasn't surprised at the scene towards the end. I, for one, was grateful for the levity brought by the closing scene. Had the film closed on the funeral, I'd probably have felt the need to review my career choice.

Anyway I enjoyed it- I would have preferred another ending, but as in life sometimes cops do get killed. SPOILER: I saw the movie again and to answer a question about why it took so long for back up to arrive maybe because the woman in the apartment gave the wrong address she gave out 20556 Hooper (as I heard) When the officers located their bodies, they were at 41st Place off Broadway (as I heard) man that is a LONG way away(and the numbers don't match ).

Unlike a lot of action films now where half the city gets destroyed in a 20-30 minute action scene that you could skip and still know what was going on.By the end I genuinely liked the main characters and that makes the action scenes all the more intense as you are really rooting for them.The found footage thing was a little silly as clearly half the shots weren't filmed by any character in the scene (unless Casper has got a hand held), but just don't get too hung up on it. Why, if a film uses some footage supposedly filmed by characters, should every shot have to be. Other reviews on here act like it's the law.All in all watch this and enjoy it for what it is, top class entertainment that actually manages to stir a little emotion (that's if you have a heart).PS To all those saying they swear too much, clearly you've never worked in a factory/male dominated environment, it's all p**s taking all day long.",End of Watch

There is not a particular plot for this movie, Ayers is just showing you the daily lives of a Los Angeles police. Gyllenhaal and Pena acting was Oscar worthy, anything less would be absolute tragedy. The entire cast gave an outstanding performance, from the prostitutes, gangs, and regular people living their lives.

Both cops are unique and have good character development throughout the film, and their acting along with the cast is not in question.-The movie begins kinda slow and you wait to hit the catalyst and when it comes the story continues in a slow manner regarding the main story(bad guys vrs cops). The acting and directing helped to engulf the audience into thinking this is real life. Some parts were aimless because we already knew the characters well and their morals, and didn't need further explaining or ""save the cat"" moments. When the mid point hits you expect the stakes to be raised and they were, but it took too long to hit the climax and some of the air was let out of the balloon.

I felt more like I was playing Grand Theft Auto side missions then watching a gripping Hollywood film. This is what shows like SouthLand are for, where you can be random and develop characters over several episodes. This is a movie and we only have 100 minutes to put something together that has structure and a purpose. Its a fun movie while it lasts, it does entertain but when you finally get to the payoff you just kinda wonder what was the point of the film?

Unfortunately I usually see movies either in 2nd run theaters or on TV, which is okay if the movies are over a year old or classic films, but is generally too late to matter when it is new movies. But I'm putting my two cents in on this film.This flick received generally good reviews from both the public, and critics. I'm not sure I was watching the same movie as everyone else. First, the hand-held camera gambit was annoying. I know that the thought was for it to add an artistic element, but it was just plain perturbing. It reminded me of my father taking home movies back in the day. A lot of the ""action"" scenes were just fast-moving, indiscernible images, as though the camera were being flipped and spun around like a football. If not for the audio I would not have had a clue as to what was going on. Also, everything was too dark, meaning that there was a need for more daylight scenes. And it looked like scenes were spliced together ad hoc. Maybe that was part of the alleged ""artistry"" attempt in the movie.Some of the scenes of the evil Mexican gang were almost funny in their absurdity. There was one scene where the Mexican outlaws were riding in a van and shouting angry, obscenity-laced threats at each other in a thick Hispanic accent. I leaned over and asked my co-viewer sitting next to me what they were yelling about and she shrugged her shoulders and then whispered to me that she thought they were debating the scientific possibilities of inter-galactic travel. It was the high point of the movie.I'm not sure how anyone could care about the two main characters. Any attempt they made to show some personal depth and heartfelt emotion came off as either false, or aggravatingly macho. Just not good. When everyone, good guys and bad guys alike, were apparently killed in one scene near the end, I felt a relief that the bewildering and/or poorly drawn characters were gone and I would soon be in my car going home.I have seen a lot of movies in my day and this one may not be the worst, but it is probably in the bottom 20%.",End of Watch
335,fluidce,cornfest 2012,5,4 January 2013,"This film was super corny. And that's MY opinion obviously. I was actually able to appreciate some things about this film. The action scenes were well done. I thought the camera angles were clever, but at the same time sort of unnecessary. It's almost as if they were used for the sake of using them, and that's annoying. The real problem I had with this film were the characters. They just weren't very believable and I could not take any of them seriously - especially the gangsters. And I don't think the actors/actresses were to blame for this. It was just really poorly written dialogue. The kind you might expect like an average high school student to come up with. Also went overboard with the 'bro'-ing. Cmon man. That's just way too many 'bro's for just one movie. I was pretty much 'bro'ed out before the movie was even half finished. It was 'bro' this and 'bro' that, give me a 'bro'eak!",End of Watch

Also, you'll need Tylenol after watching this movie. The shaky ""documentary style"" footage was unnecessary and very overplayed.

338,vedanttripathi19,A fresh cop story even 2019,9,13 July 2019,"My review for ""end of the watch""
Don't watch this movie if you are looking for cliche cop story.
This movie feels fresh to me even in 2019.
This is a thrill packed movie, you never feel pulled out of movie, for not even once, it keeps you pulling in. Makes you come face to face with the horror that a family of a police experiences, by connecting you with them through great character moments. It can leave you smiling through the moments of happiness and joy . End of the watch will leave a respect for the police and smile on your face as it ends.The way camera is used in directing this movie makes you forget that you are watching a movie and those camera angles that are embedded within the characters organically keeps you locked inside the movie.The only reason I am giving it 9 because I am waiting for something to top this.",End of Watch
339,mooky-210-917116,A surprisingly fantastic film.,8,12 January 2015,"'End of Watch' is filmed documentary style, which isn't groundbreaking in the fact that it's nothing that I have not seen before but, it certainly adds quality to the tone of the film. I think if it was made using conventional camera work then it would not have been nearly as effective. It would have felt more like a standard buddy-cop movie as opposed to the genuine intimacy that the chosen style gave it. Now, as with all films that use this technique or similar styles that we see in the 'found footage' genre, it is not without its flaws. Some times throughout 'End of Watch' it just doesn't work for me and on occasion I find it a bit irritating but, that's more because I struggle to fully appreciate this method as much as others might. However, as I said, this really is the only style that you could use that would make this film work successfully. So i'll have to put that aside as a pet-peeve and a bit of a contradictory statement. Let me talk about what I consider to be some of the bad parts of this movie and why it finally had me changing my mind overall and having the desire to watch it again. It starts off with a nice little chase scene with the viewpoint from within the patrol car as Gyllenhaal's character narrates a fairly cheesy bit of script-work of the top. This was all going pretty good until this scene came to a climax and ended up with some unnecessary fist-pumping. That's when I though 'Oh goody. It's going to be a bunch of cops blowing each other all the way through and doing congratulatory back-pats whilst telling each other how awesome they are'. It was losing me already. The film then plods along at a fairly flat pace as we follow Taylor and Zavala (Gyllenhaal and Pena, respectively) going about their tours with a lot of in-car conversations and crime scene attending. I found the whole gang warfare thing to be quite boring and every 'gang' character that I met throughout it all just irritated the hell out of me. Especially the women. There was some truly clichéd and terrible acting from the co- stars and I thought the general script was pretty bad at times and there were some stupid moments that had me shaking my head on several occasions. I am also a man that swears, quite frequently as it happens but, the amount of swearing in this film drove me absolutely insane. I mean, it was seriously over-the-top and I'm not really sure what Ayer was going for when he wrote the script. Yes, I understand that people swear but a variation of 'fuck' 20 times in a sentence after every other word is just ridiculous. It had me cringing at its complete lack of necessity. I really didn't understand the purpose of it to be honest. Not to that extent. I haven't found swearing that annoying since the 600 times 'fracking' was used in the updated 'Battlestar Galactica' series. One hour into 'End of Watch' and I was still trying to figure out where this film was headed, having not read anything about it or stumbled across any spoilers. I was constantly waiting for something awesome to kick in but, slowly losing heart that it never would. This is pretty much how it continued until I finally got to the finale (that I had been begging to happen since it started). Suddenly, everything changed. The climax of this film was brilliantly powerful and it made me reevaluate the entire film. I realized very quickly that in just wanting to get to the end of film that I thought was pretty pointless all the way though, that I had underestimated how good it really was. What I had completely missed and took for granted was how great Gyllenhaal and Pena really were. The chemistry between them is absolutely fantastic and they both play their roles with wonderful conviction. What they manage to do is make you for get that you are watching a film and really believe that these two are the closest of friends. Everything about their performances is so natural and you have no problem believing that these two are closer than brothers. This for is is definitely Gyllenhaal's best performance to date (although i'm sure may would disagree with me) and Pena is on typically fine form. Predictably. This film isn't about gang-warfare and conflict. It's about the love, respect and unbreakable bond that two serving officers have for each other. This is a film that is full of heart and companionship and the fact that I missed this all the way through because I was too busy picking out all the negatives and criticizing it (possibly wanting to hate it) is a shocking underestimation as a film fan. This is a film that I will definitely be watching again with more of an open mind and better understanding of what it is all about. I cannot recommend 'End of Watch' enough to anyone out there. Gyllenhaal fan or not. If you have not seen this great film, get on it right away.",End of Watch

That movie was awesome, this one was a steaming pile of stink. It was as if the guy just finished watching every first person cam film and thought, ""Why don't I make a shaky cam film about cops with a bunch of random scenes thrown together that make no sense"". Was it just trying to be hip and let me figure out why there were about 40 scenes that had nothing to do with a very thin plot? Maybe. Who cares? I did get a sense of chemistry between the two main cops but that couldn't save this movie at all. There were three of us that went to see this in my group. We all disliked it.

Jake Gyllenhaal is in this.Cons:
The rest of this review.
This film is painfully predictable and simple. Cops are good. Criminals are bad. Criminals kill people and kidnap children because they are the bad guys. It's painfully superficial and must be written by a 9 year old raised with a strong pro-cop bias. And also hates minorities, as every criminal is Hispanic or black.The side plots are basic and devoid of any emotional intelligence. Things happen because they should happen, rather than for any nuanced or intelligent reason. Everything that isn't murdering minorities seems like filler to get to murdering more minorities.Also, without spoiling it, the end is very predictable. Just kidding the partner dies because someone has to, but you can't kill the main character otherwise the imbecilic troglodytes who appreciate this gargantuan garbage fest will lose their minds.Ultimately, if you want to vicariously experience the joy of simultaneously killing minorities and imposing the force of the law with a badge and a gun, this is the film for you.

Nothing about this film is original from the black and white protagonists and antagonists, who are entirely devoid of nuance, to the cookie-cutter dialogue. The camerawork, intended to add grit and authenticity, only serves to cheapen an already dirt-poor film and makes it more difficult to follow its lazy action sequences.

Which is not to say there isn't any action in End of Watch, but I wasn't expecting to see the relationship between the partners done so honestly.

350,jah-uittenbogaard,Less interesting for non-US-residents,6,29 October 2012,"The film feels like one protracted episode of a real-life police-series, like ""Cops"", a story-line is close to absent. You just move from one police-intervention to the other. The fact that both police-officers accidentally collide with the interests of a Mexican drug-cartel, seems to play a minor role and the tension that it causes is not built up throughout the film. The story is really about how two men can bond when they put their lives on the line together on a daily basis. So what. I've honestly seen quite a few films who did this job better. The clue is, I think, that it is not just about two men bonding, it is about a Caucasian Anglo-Saxon and a Mexican bonding. Did the filmmakers, and Jack Gyllenhaal and Anna Kendrick in specific, want to make a social statement:"" Mexicans are no different from 'us', they can be heroes ánd crooks, just like us""? The social or ""racial"" issue (if it is one) is lost on non-US-residents. Here it just isn't an issue. This fact makes the film a lot less interesting to watch: it is time nicely spent, but the film won't stick in your mind.The camera-work though deserves a compliment: the hand-held cameras enhance your involvement in the action. It sometimes makes you feel that you are part of the action. Pity though that the reason for this, an art-project for officer Brian Taylor, is never picked up in the film. On top of that, the reason why the ""villains"" would want to film their action with a hand-held, remains a total mystery throughout the film.",End of Watch

I was literally cheering at the screen, then it happens. Like a sucker punch in the gut, it's not like you didn't expect it. In what seems like a matter of minutes this movie took me from a euphoric high, to a deep low that had me wanting to jump through the screen and cap some gangsters.

353,karl-hovenkotter,Not as bad as some would indicate,7,18 June 2014,"This movie evokes some of the most manic reviews I've seen. People seem to either love it, or hate it. To me, it falls somewhere in-between. It's not an Oscar-worthy revelation of a film, nor is it a tasteless pile of garbage as some reviews would lead you to believe. I give it a solid 6.5/10, rounded up to 7.Gyllenhaal and Peña serve up up some great chemistry and mostly- believable performances as officers Brian Taylor and Mike ""Z"" Zavala, two young, gung-ho LA cops who take their jobs more seriously than they take themselves. Their characters' zeal is admirable though it ultimately lands them in the crosshairs of a drug cartel and the local gang the cartel supplies.Just to be clear, the movie claims to be filed ""Documetary style"" though that doesn't mean it is a documentary. It uses the premise of Officer Taylor filming his daily activities for a film project to mix in a large helping of amateur footage and shaky-cam, but still retains a lot of traditional cinematography. Sometimes the shaky-cam adds to the film, but probably just as often, it detracts from it. While it adds a degree of realism to the film, there were many scenes where I felt it was just unnecessary. The film has plenty of action, although the distribution is a bit unbalanced to me. Some scenes are fast-paced and filled with action, and some scenes are unbearably slow. Also, the pacing and time-line are a mystery. The film seems to cover six-to-twelve months of time, but there are no indications of this during the film. In one scene, Taylor starts dating a new girl(Janet)and Zavala's wife is pregnant, and another where she has the baby, and another where Taylor and Janet are getting married. This lack of discernible time-line is confusing, because several other events in the movie feel like they could be happening within days, or possibly weeks.Overall, the movie is believable. Some scenes feel rather outlandish, (like the gang members' inability to hit the broad side of a barn with automatic weapons. Though considering their inexperience, and firing positions, I suppose it's plausible.) but the plot and characters are certainly within the scope of reality (Which, considering the subject matter, can be slightly disturbing.)Fortunately, the characters in End of Watch far outweigh its camera and pacing woes to produce a film that rises above its ""Found footage"" and ""Buddy cop"" peers. If you enjoy those types of movies, you'll enjoy End of Watch.",End of Watch

There is one scene where six (maybe more) bad guys and gals open up on the heroes with machine guns for maybe two minutes or more yet Jake (or whatever his name is) survives.

355,scottmoses,It's a good recruitment film at best,7,23 September 2012,"Overall, the movie was about a relationship that is formed by two officers who work in the most demanding areas of police work. I liked the synergy between Pena and Gyllenhaal, their banter was genuine and real, and I believed that these are the conversations two officers have in a car on a day to day basis. Beyond that, the film lacked depth, a viable story, the use of hand-held cameras may leave some film goers queasy.The dialogue of the Latino gangsters was ridiculous, and while I believe they probably do talk like that, it made for following the story almost nauseating.I liked that it showed the police as heroes rushing into a burning house, that seeing the lowest parts of humanity on a daily basis takes its toll on a person (this could have been a deeper focus of the movie) and sometimes people who have to make decisions in an instant and override their emotions for the sake of justice (he could have blown that fat guy away, he should have, but didn't).What I guess this movie conveys at its core, is that these men and women who put their lives on the line each and every day are people too, with wives, husbands and children, just like the people they are there to serve and protect.",End of Watch
356,kealamilles,Superbly and pleasantly surprised despite a slightly uneven conclusion,8,26 May 2013,"*SPOILER ALERT* *** I firmly believe that the only reason this film did not get a bigger release is: the general American movie audience does not appreciate this films disjointed denouement. And to be honest, the only reason I watched it is because a friend was cast in it. But I'm glad he was, because I would have otherwise missed out on a fine specimen of filmmaking. That said—and without going into too much detail—the final scene (technically, an epilogue) feels out of place and, in my opinion, presumptuously attempts levity after what should have been an aggressively poetic conclusion to this formidable cop drama. Kind of like a rescue-via-catharsis that serves to dismiss the audience with a slightly brighter badge of honor for laboring through the grit and violence only to come to a tragically somber conclusion. Honestly, that's the ONLY reason I gave it 4-stars.****But the grit and violence are precisely what makes this unconventional film worth every tense minute. David Ayer's direction only strengthens his already elucidating screenplay about two hot-shot cops on the beat in South Central LA. While this setup certainly lacks novelty it is part of what I suspect is one of the most brilliantly formulated films in recent years. And by formulated I do, indeed, imply formulaic as the screenplay offers many of American cinemas favorite themes and structures. Look and listen close enough and you'll pick up the hints, which will lead you to quickly discern how the movie will end. Of course, the rapid-fire pace by which dialogue exchanges and scenes transition skillfully strafes you past discernment as you focus minutely on the action at hand. It's a bit like a magic show; only the kind of magic show you never intended to see, but feverishly thanked your friend for inviting you once the lights dimmed. Yes, thank you David Fernandez, Jr.At 97 minutes this film is short, but it doesn't feel that way. Still, parts of the story could have used a little more development. In places the plot feels a bit loose. For example, the script only loosely handles the narcotics trafficking story arc that develops late into the film, despite it being the only real story arc that matters in the end. I wanted to know a little more about the specifics that seemed important enough to include solely as plot points. However the strong character development and the nifty (and, yes, convenient) thread of Taylor's hand-held camera ""elective project"" only increases the intimacy of the relationships and the depth of realism. Jake Gyllenhaal (Brian Taylor) is always a safe bet (and to be fair, while I enjoyed Donnie Darko I was not a fan of Jarhead and he performed exquisitely in both) but Michael Pena (Mike Zavala) continues to increase his box office stock with a realistic, emotional, and complex performance he did not often get to showcase in earlier roles on the other side of crime. Anna Kendrick (as the fair-skinned Janet) exudes a youthful innocence and grace that might have been, perhaps, the most exceptionally understated-yet-perfectly-restrained casting choice. In addition to these performances, I must also lay praise to Roman Vasyanov for impressive cinematography. I even found myself commenting on how much I loved not only the editing but also simple things like establishing shots. While I've never seen Southland or The Wire, I imagine fans of those shows will enjoy this movie. If you like hard-hitting realism and complex, emotional dramas, this could be the right film for you. There is violence and there is blood, but they do the story justice in a movie that does justice to the art of filmmaking as a whole.",End of Watch

I suggest the Batman flick, or even Nemo 3D, but as he describes 'Mexican drug gangstas Vs cops,' 'good actors,' 'hype gang shootouts,' I am persuaded to agree.As soon as the movie starts, I'm jabbing Jud in the stomach with right hooks.Initial Impression: My moral sinks as I see that it's another 'home video style' movie. What is it with this Blair Witch, Cloverfield trend? I don't want movies to be filmed crappier. And, I guess that is not a huge deal, but it creates a detachment of doubt in my immersion as the plot struggles to incorporate why this one dude happens to be carrying a camera everywhere, how he happens to film everything awesome that happens. Especially, in this film, in which the cop raids houses and engages in battles, all the while filming it. I think at one point, the director said 'screw it' and just started filming third person, but with a crappy lens... And by the way, if one of my friends just started filming everything for weeks on end, I would punch him in the balls.The plot: Two cops drive around in their cruiser, talking about their day and stuff. They like to talk about their kids, and girlfriends, and wives. A lot. On occasion, there is some random banter between the cops, and you get to chuckle along with the rest of the tools in the audience, as you get to share in police banter - just like one of the boys, cool! (eyes roll) Once in a while, the cops get a call from dispatch, and I think that something cool might happen. I keep thinking that the plot will turn hardcore, once the characters are established; you know, like a high-brow action movie... But no, they get into a little bit of action, but nothing more hardcore than you would see on Law and Order. And then the cops go back to talking, oh!, more character development... I think: Something crazy is definitely going to step this movie up soon! But no, I learn more about these cops' wives. Filmed crappy.My Bias: I'm not exactly a cop lover, and to borrow from Cypress Hill, I'm not saying that I 'wanna drop dem cops trying' to snatch my crops,'but I also don't wanna drive 20mins, and pay 20 bucks, so I can watch two bi-curious cops share their feelings for 2 hours.

360,Jpdubrof,A Roller Coaster Ride... Literally,8,30 September 2012,"End of Watch is all the hype you see on the commercials. It truly is an amazing movie full of action, romance and humor based of Michael Pena's character's heritage. Gyllenhaal and Pena could not be any better at their role of two Los Angeles police officers. Anna Kendrick does a great job of illustrating the courage it takes for someone to marry a police officer knowing they sacrifice themselves everyday and may not come home that night. The main antagonist, Big Evil, plays his role perfectly from the very moment we are introduced to him. As the movie goes on a growing dislike is created towards him. He truly captures the role as a lead cartel member with his looks and his actions. The movie is a roller coaster ride of emotions. However,from the shaky camera work throughout the movie, I actually thought Iwas on a roller coaster. Friends of mine had to leave the movie to get fresh air and relieve there dizziness. It was hard for me to fully enjoy the movie because of this. I still feel as though the is as good as advertised, I just felt the camera work was hard to handle after a while.

361,skydivernick,"Cop Approved: Raw, emotional and realistic",9,3 October 2012,"The thing that really made this film stick out to me was its sense of realism.The ball busting in the patrol car, the awkward conversations, the boss asking you to write summonses, the one (or many) disgruntled cop(s), the camaraderie, the pranks - its all there. and it all really happens.Being in law enforcement I almost feel as if the general public won't be able to truly appreciate how much they nailed the day to day interactions cops have with each other and especially their partners. What the film did do beautifully was humanize police officers. There are even times when you see the main characters emotion getting to them. There were times you were laughing, times you were on the edge of your seat and times you were crying. During one of the most impactful scenes I was able to cut the tension in the theater with a knife, and it was so silent you could hear a pin drop. That is what makes this movie stand out to me.To all of my fallen brothers and sisters in blue, rest easy now your watch is over, we've got it from here...Fidelis ad Mortem.",End of Watch
362,katshimmers,Fantastic film!,9,8 September 2012,"The camera-work alone is worth going to the cinema for this. At times you will feel disorientated because of it - but totally worth it.I attended the screening at TIFF which included a Q&A session with the actors and writer director, there is a real sense of ""work"" here. They trained and shadowed LAPD cops as well as undertaking boxing, martial arts and all sorts of other aspects to get into these characters. They also rehearsed scenes 100 times off to give those back and forwards moments between Jake and Michaels characters the flawless effect. Bravo on that - you really believe they are brothers and not just in the cop sense.Be warned - there is no holding back in this film. They do not glaze over any of the details of what it can be like being a cop, a fellow cop or a cops wife/girlfriend for that matter. Case in point - knife in eye.",End of Watch
363,ProjectPhoenix,Powerful...,9,23 September 2012,"This is my first review, so please, bare with me. I figured i'd go to the theater to see an early movie before my normal Sunday routine of watching football. I decided on ""End of Watch"" when I got to the theater, I figured ""why not?"" I was pleasantly surprised. This is the best, most captivating, realistic, powerful cop movie I have ever seen. In my opinion, ""Training Day"" is no longer director David Ayer's crown jewel. The chemistry between Gyllenhal and Pena is pure magic. You BELIEVE that they are best friends and partners. The action is extremely realistic. There is one particular moment in the film where the two main characters are engaged in a fire fight, and as they are running, Jake's character exclaims ""This sh!t fcking sucks, bro!"" I almost came out of my chair applauding because that is the exact thing you're thinking when you're in a shootout and i've actually heard someone with me in the situation say the same thing. I hope I get at least one person to go see this movie with this post. People complain about the shaky camera work, but it adds so much and you become slightly disoriented which was a plus for me in a movie like that. I don't get emotionally involved in movies very often, but this was one of those movies.",End of Watch

The respect and valor shown through the United States Police Force in the Film is unparalleled in any other film. The film might even be put into the Act of Valor category as far as inspiring action films go. It may even leave you in tears and open ones mind about the efforts and heroics that go on to keep our country safe. The film is always moving and keeps the interest of the viewers through many different techniques including comedy, action, and even emotionally stressful situations.

But for me, End of Watch is the best rookie film so far, it's a well-written story about the day-to-day life of the rookies. I like how David Ayer describes the cops as a human nature (the friendship, the manhood, including those swears and curses) I've watched Jake Gylenhall played various character, I knew him from Donnie Darko, The day After Tomorrow, Bubble Boy, Love and Other Drugs. As well as, Michael Pena. He played an arrogant boxer in Calcium Kid then meet up again with Orlando Bloom in the Good Doctor, he played gangster in 30 minutes or less. But, I never seen both Jack and Michael having a very strong chemistry with other supporting actor like I've seen in this movie. Somehow Jack and Michael convinced me that they've been partner for years before they shot the movie and also their dialogs showed the natural bond between them, the jokes, the body gesture it was so natural I don't know if it is on the script but they successfully made the stunning act. I've watched the movie twice, and it's still thrilling me. The movie as well as the actors deserve an Oscar nomination.",End of Watch

Have you seen what the boys at the LAPD have to go through?,10,27 September 2012,"End of watch is by far one of the greatest films I have seen this year. It had everything you could ask for a film and it will start making think of how the brave men and women of the LAPD put their life on the line every single day.From the first scene you are thrown into the shoes of the LAPD officers and it doesn't let go from there. From now until those end credits you are with these officers to the end, and by god, will you feel welcome. So much credit needs to go to Gyllenhaal and Peña. They are one of the greatest pairs to have ever been seen on the big screen. The way these two interact with each other would be seen as a product of years of partnership. The acting in this movie is TOP OF THE LINE! Peña in particular was just amazing! Peña has long been Hollywood's most underrated actor and this film just lets him shine like the amazing star that he is! The plot itself revolves around the two's daily routine as police officers and as every day people. Being with family and friends, going out etc. Every day the two must face new obstacles that will lead to them getting more and more recognition within the LAPD and the local drug cartel. The F bombs fly around quite a bit in this money, followed by scenes of extreme violence and some truly shocking images so be worn.the only major complaint one can have with this film is the style filming. The film is shown in this ""Found Footage"" format, meaning there is a lot of shaking and the action my not be all that clear. However I found it to only add to the sense of immersion.In short go: GO AND SEE THIS MOVIE! The acting is some of the best seen this year, the action is great and the set pieces are some that you wont soon forget!10/10",End of Watch
369,mattyp083,Amazing dichotomy of emotions,9,28 August 2012,"Jake and Michael have the most amazing on-screen chemistry that makes the viewers believe they're truly best friends and police partners. The way the script was written allowed David Ayer to elicit an incredible range of emotion from the viewers. It's hilariously funny during car scenes between Jake and Michael, playing on relatable awkward topics of sex, dating, and other things best friends would joke about, yet incredibly serious, showing just how intense and dangerous police officers' jobs in South Central LA can be. The use of Jake's hand-held camera gives a Paranormal Activity feeling (without the headache) that adds to the ""realness"" of the film.

370,adancs26,Unforgettable,10,9 September 2012,"I have never been to a TIFF premiere before, so I am glad ""End of Watch"" was my first one. The director and the cast were down-to-earth, honest and had sense of humour, which is surprising, because I expected celebrities to be stiff and arrogant. They watched the movie with us and stayed for Q&A after credits. The movie impressed me because of its shooting technique. The movie is self-shot, which makes it intimate and sends the message across more powerfully. Director David Ayer confessed that it took him six days to write the script, and 20 years of experience. ""End of Watch"" tells the story of friendship between two police men patrolling the streets of southern Los Angeles. The reality of the neighbourhoods is shocking: gang members, drug addicts, shootings and profanity. But Brian Taylor (Jake Gyllenhall) and Mike Zavala (Michael Peña), the main characters, are not afraid to venture and try to set order in a world that became out of control. Their chemistry on screen is what makes the movie more interesting, because they are so different from each other, and yet they become best friends, being inseparable in all important moments of life. The action is happening fast, but romance and friendship are present between violence and real-life drama. A lot of scenes were spoken in Spanish, so it will help if you know some Spanish (at least swearing words). I was impressed by the way police women (America Ferrera, Cody Horn) were portrayed and how well they played their part, with endless courage and dedication, removing all stereotypes. The final scene reveals the essence of it all: being able to laugh with tears along your best friend, finding a job you love and would give your life away for. This is an unique movie with a twisted ending, revealing the difficulty of being police men and the implications it has on families and friendships. The world needs more ""End of Watch"", more reality because we seem to be living in an ignorant bubble, feeding ourselves with chick flicks and bad quality movies.P.S You know what you have to do on September 21st.

It is not a movie for kids whatsoever, since it is a brutal representation of cop life. With that being said getting past the roughness you have an incredible movie. It breaks against the mold and gives you a real life perceptive of cop drama. How street cops are treated as well in the turf wars. The individual distinct story-lines that are intertwined in this film were very well done, but the focal piece is two cops in south la. I love that it didn't have a Hollywood ending at all. Reality is most these cops in district 13 and 9 die in action, sometimes even brutal death. Most these cops never get recognition of the heroic actions they do against drug cartels. I rate this movie a 9 out of 10. I thinks cops especially street cops as these two portray would find this the most genuine representation of any cop movie ever made. Heat has nothing on this movie.",End of Watch

Absolutely a great movie. Action, suspense, drama, comedy, etc. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Pena were amazing together and they convince the audience that they are literally best friends. I had reservations about the camera style used, but it made it that much better. It was filmed similarly to COPS. This movie did what I think movies should do- draw you in and sincerely make you care about the characters. The film is similar to ""Training Day"" but better, in my opinion. The ""bad guys"" are very realistic, and I would have to almost believe they were actual gang members from Los Angeles. The movie touched on the violence of the Mexican drug cartels. Also shows an interesting look at relationship between fellow officers.

The plot keeps you on the edge if your seat the whole movie, it's hard to tell what's going to happen next.

This is one aspect I really liked about the film.While it does have its share of gore, there are plenty of laughs to be had that ""lighten"" it up a little bit, which seems like a natural reaction. It adds greatly to the movie's believability (despite one part that in my view was very unprobable, but hey, if all movies were 100% real they would just be boring old life, haha.) The fact that the movie was designed in a way that what happens in the movie could actually happen (albeit probably not to the same set of partners) in one of America's ghettos is just awesome.I've got more to say, but I don't want to write an essay, haha.Best Movie of the Year!!

My personal reflection was one that was positively raving about the two cop characters, their relationship to each other and what happened in the end. However, my friend found the movie painfully negative about both ethnic groups. She felt that, once more, the only bad people portrayed were the two groups in the movie and that people - mainly those in my ethnic group - would, ""as always"" think the movie depicted Blacks and Hispanics collectively as they are... It was not until I felt her pain that I realized what she was going through. In her own words, she was taking nothing from David Ayer and his artist strengths. She said what I was thinking: those of us who viewed the two groups as reality of life would find no fault in the exploitation of them. We could care less about which neighborhood.

It begins with Brian and Mike constantly joking around and each call they have gets more and more serious. They're dealing with gang wars, but they spend their down time discussing the type of women they want to be with or telling ridiculous stories. Then they get the call to find the missing children, follow the lead on the guy that pulls a gun out on Mike after they pull him over, offer assistance to Van Hauser (David Harbour) and his partner, and eventually get baited into following that van that runs a red light.

Gyllenhaal and Pena are at the top of the class for their acting skills. The two appear to have formed a bond and a chemistry that is critical for police officers in any big city. The cam-view style filming was unique and superb in this setting, not choppy like the Blair Witch Project. It really puts you in the moment. I have heard this film compared to the unfortunately short lived TV series ""Southland"", and I would agree, except it would be ""Southland"" on steroids. I don't know how the director was able to transition from cop humor, to intense adrenalin rush with such precision, But he pulled it off flawlessly.

This was essentially a snuff flick. The higher plot (if there was one) was that life sucks and the bad guys win. There was no elevation of the spirit...no higher meaning of the story. You spend the movie getting to know the characters and they simply kill one. The dealers and cartels win, no side-plots discussed, nothing...it just ends. They apologetically revisit an earlier 4 minute buddy flick contextual discussion as an afterthought...kind of a tart apology for such foul fare.In short I trust movie makers to bring me something, I was manipulated and brought low by this film...to no end...I am quite angry.

The fact that this is supposedly the LA PD makes this offensive (was this movie written and directed by the fraternal order of police?) more than just unbelievable but that isn't even my primary issue with the movie.My primary issue with this movie is that it is maybe 15 minutes worth of movie material, probably more like 10, and 2 hours worth of inane and tedious home video style jabber. One person left the theater an hour into the movie, mind you there were only five people in the theater, I wanted to leave after 20 minutes but my friend and I had nothing to do that night and that is why we went in the first place.This movie had almost no plot and certainly no story.

Also, there was no solid plot to what they were unknowingly ""uncovering"" - it was quite unclear, and we drew our own conclusions. Top marks for the ""shoot out"" at the end though - edge of your seat stuff! The only real jaw-dropping moment for me was when their colleague was rooted to the spot with the knife in his eye and his partner was beaten to a pulp around the side of the building. Horrific.

But the worst thing about this movie has to be the final scene, the gritty ending is inexplicably followed by a cutback to earlier in the day of the shooting to show MIchael Pena and Jake Gylenhal talking about girls and lacks any substance, its almost as if the director felt bad about having something of substance in the movie so he adds this scene to make the audience feel more at home in this sad attempt at a movie.

But i understand that if writer started the movie with an idea of real life scene, that he need to continue all story with it.. thats one thing i liked about movie.. other i think was that real friendship around Brian and mike.. they really looked like real friends in real life. all that conversations and all emotions looked real. I may put 9 for this movie, because it was really different from other crime, police movies. i really enjoyed it and i hope you too.",End of Watch

395,static4192,Unexpectedly Fantastic,9,29 March 2013,"I went into this movie via recommendation from several friends expecting it to be a lame big picture Cops rendition. There is a really good blend of character development and surprisingly good suspense and action. They put together a good screen team for this film and I thought it was an awesome watch! I highly recommend. The only drawback on the film for me was the length of the film, so prepare for a 2 hour flick. Some of the scenes are disheartening at best and you will find yourself surprisingly shocked at some of the things that happen in a few of the scenes. Although dry, the humor throughout actually does the film good justice. Excellent drama!",End of Watch
396,nfcfalcon567,Great movie,8,9 April 2013,"How would you like to take a ride through the streets of South Central LA with the men and women of the LAPD? Well here's your chance. From the writer of Training Day comes a captivating crime action drama starring Michael Peña and Jake Gyllenhaal as two hero cops who stumble upon a secret that puts them at the top of the hit list for one of the United States' most notorious drug cartels. Writer and director David Ayer's realistic portrayal of the lives of two LAPD officers captivates and emotionally connects the audience to the lead characters. From the start, Gyllenhaal and Peña portray the chemistry of brothers, brothers of the badge that is. Their comical antics and entertaining discussions on a broad array of familial and racial topics allow the audiences to not only enjoy the two officers but to relate to them as well. David Ayer's vision constantly changes from a lighter tone to a darker and much more serious tone back to a lighter tone, taking the viewers on an emotional roller coaster ride all the way until the climactic ending.Movies nowadays have started to become unoriginal. Overall plots and story lines remain the same while the only major differences come from the titles and character names. For example, soon to be released film White House Down has a striking resemblance plot-wise to the recently released film Olympus Has Fallen. From the looks of it, it seems as though Hollywood has run dry of ideas. Recycling has become a Hollywood writers number one policy. End of Watch offers something new and fresh. It grants the audience something that breaks away from the run of the mill story and ventures them into the unexpected. Something out of the ordinary is the shooting style that David Ayer chose to use. The movie is shot mainly from hand-held cameras as well as clip-on cameras that allow for a ton of Point Of view angles that make you feel more a part of the movie than most other movies out today. It gives you the feeling of being right there with Gyllenhaal and Peña throughout the entire movie. The footage is supposed to be considered as recently popular ""found footage"". For those unfamiliar with the found footage technique, it is a style of shooting directors use to give the audience the impression that everything was filmed by the characters and later discovered and edited by an outside source. It's a different experience than other instances of this found footage genre. Hand-held cameras tend to be extremely shaky, and many complain that they have no idea what is going on and leave the theatre feeling dizzy and nauseous. In End Of Watch, however, all of that is kept to a minimum. No matter how good the rest of the may be, a hero movie is no good without a very convincing antagonist, or in this case antagonists. The members of the notorious Mexican drug cartel are shown as ruthless, unemotional savages. With no remorse, they take pride in the slaughter of others for the sake of their comrades. Even their names strike fear: Big Evil, Demon, and La La. Maybe not La La as much. In the scenes where the gang members are carrying out their dirty deeds, you can sense the brotherhood, love and passion that they have for their gang. It is reminiscent of that of a sports team, but for all of the wrong reasons. The realism in these scenes is divine. The members prepare themselves mentally and congratulate the younger members on a job well done, teaching them that what they are doing is right, and that there is nothing else but the Barrio (their neighborhood gang). It is an excellent portrayal of the gangs in Southern California. The acting of both main heroes, and I do not use that word lightly, is phenomenal. As I stated before it is easy to connect with them. You feel like you've known them your whole life and they still live just up the block from you. A good amount of time passes throughout the movie. One of the officers has a kid; the other meets a girl and eventually gets married. They're both homely men who live average lives. Not much is special about them except that they push the red and blue. Both officers perform a couple of heroic deeds. Whether it is chasing down criminals or running into burning houses, these guys can do it all. They are as noble and loyal to the badge as you could get without overdoing it. Many other cop movies show that cops had to be crooked in order to survive the crime-ridden streets they patrol, such as Batman Begins, Serpico and of course Training Day. Not these guys. Known for writing crime dramas surrounding crooked cops, David Ayer's change in content is unexpected yet phenomenally carried out. End of Watch salutes the men and women of Police forces everywhere who put their lives on the line each and every day for the safety of the community.If you haven't gotten the point by now, I'll say it as plain as day: I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It has everything an interesting cop movie needs: action, drama, crime, suspense, and most importantly great acting. All of these elements worked well together to create a memorable experience. You rooted for the good guys and you hated the bad guys. If my word isn't enough to convince you to see this movie, there are numerous other reviews that feel the same as I do. Highly regarded film rating website Rottentomatoes.com gave End of Watch a whopping 85% rating, making it a ""fresh pick"". Recently deceased and world famous movie critic Roger Ebert stated that ""'End of Watch is one of the best police movies in recent years, a virtuoso vision of performances and often startling action"".",End of Watch
397,asia_30,Waste of a Redbox rental,3,9 May 2013,"On a positive note, I only wasted 2 hours of my life and $1.30 for the rental of this movie.The negatives are many: 1. Documentary-style filming by an on-duty policeman. Talk about fantasy.2. The main characters dialog consists of using an expletive for every other word. No one talks that way - and I seriously doubt that real police swear that much. My guess is that the producers were worried that, if they took out the expletives, the movie would only be half as long as it was. Or, that the writers may have to (gasp) actually write something along the lines of story or plot.3. The villains in the movie also use an expletive for every other word. Annoying and I doubt that criminal masterminds have to use all of that to make their way up the food chain.4. Plot or lack thereof: I really didn't see any character development for any of the supporting or main characters. In the end, I just didn't care very much about any of them.5. Overuse of the words ""bro"" and ""dude"". Are the main cop characters police or are they surfer dudes? Srsly.6. Ending: Just abrupt and non-fulfilling. One could think that the production ran out of money and they decided that this would be a fine time to roll the credits.Summary: Save your life force for watching something else.

The only good parts here and there are the Shootouts. The actors emotions were overused and incredibly annoying... Also, I must mention, the excessive use of ""FUCK"" over and over and OVER again does NOT make it more realistic and only annoys the crap out of me. Most of the characters cursed more than an average person by a factor of 10.Shot in documentary style... says IMDb.. I love documentaries for their true to life aspect, but this movie ain't one of them. In fact I really don't know what this movie is about, IMO it is just a waste of your hard earned money, unless of course hearing F**K before and after every other word is your kind of entertainment... for me it simply is two pollux + two hallux down.I'd give this movie a 2/5 because it does get realistic up to a certain point.",End of Watch

This movie literally had profanity in every sentence. I'm sure this movie might have actually been decent had every other word not been profane. I'm not a goody goody, and I do use profanity within reason, but this movie blew within reason out of the water. The camera was like that of paranormal activity, and I honestly didn't like watching the camera jump up and down as someone was running. They would have been better off just setting it up like an actual movie. If you can get past those two things, then by all means, watch it.

I would recommend this movie to my friends and all of you reading this. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña were the perfect actors for this movie and its definitely a movie to watch. My favorite part about this movie is that they recorded themselves and talked to us in a away. The action scenes are intense and i feel like i am in the movie when i watch. The movie taught me that being a cop is more than what it looks like. Both the main actors showed Teamwork and Heroic acts and that's why this movie is one of my favorites. There is a lot more to expect than the trailer itself shows. The movie has quite a bit of foul language and is not really a family movie but parents would most likely enjoy it.,End of Watch
403,wtempest9,Messy plot development and supporting cast,5,17 August 2014,"When I sat down to watch ""End of Watch"" I had no expectations. The town I attend college in does not have a movie theater, so along with my peers, I completely missed it in the box office. So, lacking any sort of hear-say or recommendation, I cracked a beer and sunk into the living room couch.I was immediately intrigued by the fast paced opening scene, and impressed by the incredibly realistic banter between Pena and Gyllenhaal. At first I enjoyed the home video approach to filming it as it made the characters even more personable. Yet, when I discovered that the gang members were also conveniently enrolled in extra credit film classes, my confidence in the flick immediately dwindled.As the movie progressed, and the buddy officers scratched the surface of several cases of criminal activity, it became apparent that the abundance of disconnection would eventually culminate into some sort of action and explanation rich finale. Little did I know that along with the looming tragedy, disappointment was in the forecast.There were a few scenes in particular (Spoiler Alert) that seemed puzzling enough to make a re-appearance. When the cops get a call regarding missing children, they are greeted by a stressed out mother and her rather nonchalant partner. The scene is very moving and well done, yet when we discover the two children are taped up in the closet, it is apparent that the boyfriend/husband/brother is behind their disappearance. We are then left not knowing whether the man is arrested, or just excessively fond of R. Kelley's renowned urban opera. The following scene of Gyllenhaal getting his sweat on, backlit by the city lights, is about as necessary to the movie as bringing a massage chair on a camping trip would be. Although it becomes clear that this particular happening, is merely used to show the intensity and occasionally disturbing thrill ride that the boys and blue endure, it makes the plot even more scattered.Another aspect of the movie I found to be quite distasteful, was Anna Kendrick. Despite her awful character in Pitch Perfect, and avian-like facial features, her acting was actually decent. Her personality linked up quite nicely with Gyllenhaal's, yet the development of her character was about as predictable as a Cinderella re-make. It is clear that she is a vehicle used to create higher stakes for Gylenhaal's character. The Marriage scene is fun, but anyone who has ever seen a movie, could pause the film there and know that a baby will be on the way, by the sh*t hits the fan for our police friends. The way I see it, her character's role would be better developed verbally, leaving more time to actually connect the criminal activity in the film.Despite the use of excessive scenes to develop the characters and shed expository light on whit it might be like to enforce the law, the icing on the disappointment cake was the under-usage of the black gang. After Pena puts down his badge and scraps with one of the elder members of the local bloods, David Ayer makes it clear that our dynamic duo earns some street cred and favor with the local gang. It just so happens that this gang is the rival of the local cholos, and the primary antagonists in the film. When the cops dive a little to deep into the affairs of a Mexican cartel, they become wanted men, and the previously mentioned cholos take it upon themselves to get the job done. The bloods warn the officers that they essentially have a price on their heads, but the police brush it off casually, assuming that any living police officer is on the list of undesirables for the neighborhood gang banger. Yet when doomsday rolls around, Ayer is presented with an excellent opportunity, to bring the blood gang into the climax of the film, and possibly to get our dream team out of trouble and kill off a few of their enemies in the process. Unfortunately they are left out and once again the development of another set of characters becomes incredibly irrelevant.Pena and Gyllenhaal are phenomenal throughout the film, and despite a ton of hard to avoid stereotypes, the gang members are also well portrayed. Overall ""End of Watch"" had a frustrating lack of exciting twists and turns. Mix that with way too many filler scenes, and isolated interactions and characters and you have a recipe for mediocrity.",End of Watch

It shows two very close friends that work together in the LAPD force and shows their daily issue with drug dealers and Mexican Cartels. This very emotional film looks upon a routine job for the officers in America and some of the things they deal on a regular basis.

But simply, this movie deserves 9 1/2 out of 10.The filmmaker has grown up in LA and certainly knows what he is doing. The way this movie is done is interesting, the concept is innovative and the action is convincing.The main actors performance is very good quality and the rhythm of this film keeps you interested. With all this action concerning stupid and malicious police officers which there certainly are and the controversy of giving them army material and letting them shoot dead fairly harmless people of which mostly blacks which brings the whole race problem back to the US and makes us understand that they have not really learnt that much from history since when they basically eradicated the American Indian culture from Earth, this movie brings back to mind that fact that police work is hard and that there are many policeman, even in the LAPD - which this movie talks about - that believe in the good and are doing a great, courageous and essential job so other can sleep well.No wonder police in the USA are so trigger happy with all these triggers around them, having themselves family, little babies, loved ones and partners they much respect.I for myself would not have the courage to do this job where you get no thank you at all ever.So at is is in life it's not all black and white and this excellent movie explains this better than any cop movie ever done.

In my perspective, I don't watch many cop movies or programs but I've heard some people calling it a cliché, though from my point of view it is a masterpiece in its own right. End of Watch shows the risks of the life style, and brings to light the tragedies police men and women on face day to day, made me realize 'wow this stuff happens', all while kicking your guts with suspense and blasting action (and for once minimal SGI), even showing the personal lives of the partners. The movie is extremely emotionally effective and a gold mine of unique camera angles, some annoying jump cuts were used but not in important scenes thankfully. Over all it is definitely one of my favorite movies of the genre and my favorite 'cop flick', JJ is quickly becoming a favorite of mine yet his partner definitely deserves more recognition for his effort in the film, pieced together quite well with a good flow, short but lengthy in your mind (attention grabber).",End of Watch
412,pennst26,Overall good cop movie with a great deal of potential,6,12 December 2012,"Unfortunately this movie fell short of all expectations that the high rating from IMDb has created for it. It was a good movie with believable lead characters. I found myself chuckling at their relationship and they seemed like they were actually good friends. I would guess this is where the high ratings come from, Gyllenhaal and Peña were very good. The supporting roles however were just awful. The ""gangsters"" were among the awful as were the other officers. Pretty much all of the supporting cast were not believable at all, and either the dialog suffered because of that or the other way around. There were too many scenes to describe where the actors tried to be tough or hard and it was just not palpable in my opinion.

Time to see a good movie and it has all the premises to not let you down. But this is bad. I mean not just bad.. its so bad I had to create an account here on IMDb just to warn people so they could spend their time on something good, that doesn't make them wanna break their TV just to get a sense of undoing this garbage they just witnessed.About the movie itself then... The movie will, as soon as it start, be a cliché of everything. I will not spoil anything but believe me this movie will be bad..Who wrote the dialog for this movie. Maybe if this would be a parody where it should depict these cops this would be a perfect dialog.. but it is not.. its tagged as action and drama for crying out loud. Maybe they should just one extra time include a line where someone could say ""(insert cliché phrase) ladies!"" to our main characters just to be sure someone didn't miss it during the movie..Why not just include a useless love story and some talk about their families so you get to know these average Joe cops, just so you can recognize yourself with these cops.. Great that half of the movie is wasted on this. Because every time it feels like the movie is about to finally getting somewhere you get these love stories ruin the movie. I would rather have commercial brakes than this...So you sit and wait for this waste of time going down before you eyes and it seems like it is finally going to happen, it's going to end. And damn is it a bad ending. The movie is really giving you the middle finger here, and to make things worse, when it finally ends they cut in this worthless scene between the two partners and as soon as the first one opens his mouth you know exactly how the story ends.The only crime committed here is that this train wreck was ever produced. The day before watching this mess I got a knee to my forehead doing Muay Thai and had to get some stitches, but if I could turn back time and choosing to redo just one of these two things I would go back and ask to get my skull cracked with the knee this time just to be sure to never have to end up seeing this ""movie"".Oh and did I forget to tell you about the camera work. What do you know! It sucks as well.I thought writing this review would let the anger out but it didn't. The worst part is that I suggested this movie..

The two police officers Brian Taylor and Mike Zavala are best friends that take on some Mexican Cartels. This movie was better than I expected. I liked how the movie was filmed like a documentary; it made it seem more realistic. It also had a little of every genre because it had some comedy. A scene that I thought was funny was one that included Mike Zavala and Orozco. Mike Zavala; ""Orozco, you been working out?"" Orozco; ""Yeah, with your mom."" Good movies always have more than one genre, it makes it more interesting.

417,timherndon,No point to much of it,4,23 June 2013,"It was an okay movie-but I was disappointed in many ways with it.It seemed to bring up characters and sub-plots, but then never did anything with them. For example, the character Van Hauser goes on for a long time telling our main characters that the police force would eventually turn on them. It wasn't just a passing thing he said, everything else in the movie stopped and he went on telling them this for a good 60 seconds. Why was this in the movie? It wasn't prophetic. Nothing like that happened. It just set me up to expect something bad to happen between the department and our main characters, but I was left hanging.The ""taking directing classes"" seemed a flimsy reason for Brian to be filming everything. That, too, never went anywhere. The camera style was already in-your-face and shaky--so why add yet another camera footage that was in your face and shaky. Also, I highly doubt he would be allowed to carry a camera like that on duty and especially when you are going into an unknown house for the first time, you wouldn't want to have one of your hands taken up with a camera--it just didn't come across as realistic.And I know that critics love movies that end unexpectedly--but the whole trained cops that put themselves in an alley where their position was reported by every dog they ran by, yeah, they would have had better sense than that. Heck, Brian had just earlier eluded to battle tactics he learned in the military to get them out of the apartment. Did he simply forget all those tactics when he got outside and put him and his partner in an indefensible position? And why would they simply stand in the middle of the road when an unknown car was approaching them? It just doesn't come across as realistic. It did, however, allow the death of one of the main characters and also allowed the cartel to somewhat win in their bid to kill the officers.If I'm asked by my friends if they should see this movie, I'll tell them they should--but that they should not get their hopes up too much.",End of Watch

How could 80k users like this thing ?First of all, the major pain here are the dialogs. Whoever wrote them thought this would be acclaimed as the new Tarantino style dialogs, but it fails miserably. I am not shocked by anything in movies, but they say the F word so many times that this sounds just ridiculous. These cartel guys talking between them... This is hilarious.Then, let's move on the cheesy moments. We understand the director is not that subtle man, and so he wants to make us cry, but he don't know how (at least in a subtle way). So we get these cheesy scenes, where the cop is marrying her girlfriend, and then his partner has a baby, and none of this works. We don't care about them. Is this because of bad acting ? Or bad directing ? I don't know, but this fails as well.And finally, on to the story. I was expecting some intense thing going on, but the build up is bad, really bad. Every ""street scene"" ends up quickly, and brings us back to the cheesy scenes with the cops personal lives...I understand the director wanted to make us feel the daily work of those LAPD cops, and make us care about them, but he failed EVERYWHERE: dialogs are lame, acting is bad, plot is miserable, and the movie intensity is very poor.I guess you understood that I did not like this movie.But I want to point some TV Shows that are succeeding on every points where ""End of Watch"" failed: THE SHIELD and THE WIRE. Those are exceptional cops shows, really close to reality I believe, and where you actually care about the protagonists.So forget this movie, and move on to some real things.Thanks for reading !",End of Watch
