0,MartinHafer,Incredibly original...and boy did I hate this film.,3,15 November 2021,"The basic idea behind ""Okja"" could have worked well. However, one-dimensional and cartoonish characters as well as writing really sink this film the longer you watch it.The story begins with a big press conference where a CEO announces to the world that her company will be doing something HUGE to counter world hunger....but everyone must wait ten years to see what it is.The scene now switches to the mountains of South Korea. A girl is running about with her beloved pet, Okja, an obviously genetically modified beast which is supposed to be a pig but really looks much more like a GIGANTIC hippo. It's a very cute and sweet creature and I loved this part of the film...and wanted to see more.Soon evil corporate folks as well as a celebrity animal lover (Jake Gyllenhaal) show up to take photos and to take the animal back to New York City. Apparently, of the 26 genetically modified pig-things, it's been chosen the best and they want to parade it about for a big promotional tour...as well as do EVIL things to it.However, before they can do this, Okja is saved by some nice animals rights folks from the ALF (a group actually characterized by the FBI as a dangerous terrorist organization due to their violent methods) come to rescue the piggy-thingy. But they want to also use Okja to prove to the world that animals are wonderful and eating meat is evil (a very first world sort of attitude).So what did I hate about this film? Well, a lot. First, Jake Gyllenhaal is my favorite contemporary movie star....and he is absolutely horrible in this part. Part of this is because of how it was written and part of his is his hammy, cartoon-like performance. I was just shocked at how bad it was...and disappointed. Could this be the same guy who was so impressive in films like ""Nightcrawler"", ""Source Code"", ""Donnie Darko"" and ""Prisoners""?! Second, most of the folks in the film are walking cartoons...one-dimensional and poorly written as well. The corporate people are all evil and the ALF members, for the most part, are nice (although a few of them were amazingly violent towards people in the film). There just didn't seem to be a lot of middle ground here. Third, and I already mentioned this, but the film seems like a delight for first world folks but is insulting to the starving people of the planet. If they really could produce such a huge genetically modified animal and it helped end world hunger, that would be a good thing...unless you are a vegan or vegetarian. And, to show you how evil it is, they showed some slaughterhouse scenes...and slaughterhouses are gross and nasty....just like starvation.What could have been a nice girl and her piggy-thingy movie turned out to be poorly written beyond the basic idea. Poorly written characters, some poor acting and some serious logical problems (such as it being incredibly easy to steal Okja from the corporation...even though it's a priceless animal) left me flat. I know many people like this film, I just found it to be very original but incredibly flawed....as well as, in a way, a propaganda film with an apparent agenda.",Okja
1,Leofwine_draca,Absurdist comedy with some terrible acting,4,5 September 2017,"OKJA is the latest film from Korean director Bong Joon Ho, a man who previously wowed us with his work on MEMORIES OF MURDER, THE HOST, and SNOWPIERCER. Sadly, this is by far the worst film I've seen from him, a heavy-handed moralising message movie that seems like an advert for PETA. The story features a cute Korean girl going on the run with her genetically modified giant pig Okja, while a cruel corporation tries to cut the beast up for sausages.It's as simple as that, and very reminiscent of Hollywood and films like SHORT CIRCUIT at times. However, OKJA plays out as a zany comedy for the most part and it just isn't at all funny. It feels like a silly kid's film complete with fart and poo jokes and the like but there's swearing and violence throughout, so tonally it's all over the place. As usual, the Korean stars outclass their Western counterparts time and again. Tilda Swinton returns from SNOWPIERCER and is dreadful in a dual role, but Jake Gyllenhaal is even worse with his over-the-top turn and I cringed with embarrassment to see him like this. Shirley Henderson plays the same role she's been playing for decades while Paul Dano veers between creepy and comatose. THE WALKING DEAD's Steven Yuen is better, but he needed more screen time. The other problem I had with OKJA is that I didn't find the titular creature to be either endearing or convincing, despite the best efforts of the CGI animators.",Okja
2,SnoopyStyle,imaginative but flawed,5,24 February 2018,"Lucy Mirando (Tilda Swinton) takes over the family Mirando Corporation and proclaims a new breed of super-pigs. 26 piglets are sent out to different local farmers around the globe. Ten years later, the piglets grow up and ready to be judged in a competition. Mija and her grandfather had been raising one of them, Okja, in the mountains of South Korea. When the company retrieves it, Mija goes off to Seoul to rescue it. She encounters the Animal Liberation Front led by Jay (Paul Dano) on a mission to expose the secret New Jersey Mirando animal factory.I assumed a story from the trailer. I assumed the giant pig to be the little girl's property or friend and the evil company comes to steal it. The actual opening premise of this movie is problematic. It doesn't make sense to me. The wacky comedic elements leave me cold. Bong Joon-ho continues to be one of the more interesting international directors. There are moments of fun. I love Mija chasing the truck through the streets. I love the love between Mija and Okja. Everything else is problematic.",Okja
3,kosmasp,Eco Animal,7,27 February 2018,"When this was released on Netflix the hype was big. So is it worth it? I'd say yes, but it is not a movie that could be considered a popcorn movie. It actually dares to challenge views and it does shed a bad light on the meat industry, on society and Industrial nations in general. You may think that it is a bit thick at times and you may also feel that it is a bit too violent at times too (or dark for that matter), but that's how the movie works.The pacing works, even if for some it may be too slow. The acting is really good and there is quite some talent at hand. Even in the smallest roles and even in the most cliche filled ones (see Jake Gyllenhall). If those things are something that you don't mind (much), the movie magic will get to you and you will have a ""good time"" (as much as it is possible, with the hanging message pounding on you). But if you have at least a little bit of love for animals, you will find somethng here for you",Okja
4,classicsoncall,"""She is making us fall in love with a creature that we are already looking forward to eating.""",7,1 July 2017,"I couldn't help thinking that the entire premise of developing a wide scale, inexpensive food source to feed a billion of the world's starving was blown completely out of the water when Lucy Mirando (Tilda Swinson) announced that the Best Super Pig project would take ten years. Ten years!!! What about those millions starving right now? I don't know, that seemed kind of ludicrous to me.I think the film will appeal to kids and animal rights activists, and the story does manage to tug at the heart strings regarding young Mija's (Heo-Hyun Ahn) relationship to her super sized pig. The animal itself resembled a hippopotamus more than a barnyard pig, and almost attained human qualities at times, as in the scene when he rushed to save Mija from going over a cliff. What the story failed to convey was how Okja was different from the other twenty five pigs involved in the global contest. They all looked pretty much the same to me when they were brought together, but then again, that wasn't really the point of the story.The best moments in the picture for me were those ironic moments when the principal characters parodied themselves, like the self promoting Lucy Mirando who's comment appears in my summary above, or when Animal Liberation Front pacifist Jay (Paul Dano) kicked the living crap out of fellow activist K (Steven Yeun) when he admitted to a mistranslation of Mija's request to go back home to the mountains with Okja.Quite oddly, the story line introduces concepts that are never further explored once they're mentioned, things like Dr. Johnny's (Jake Gyllenhall) Magic Animals, and that Black Chalk government team sent in by Nancy Mirando (Swinton in a dual role) to clean up her sister's mess. Gyllenhall in particular looked out of place in this film, going full gonzo in his role as the public face of the Mirando Corporation. How he managed to hang around for ten years seemed to be pretty baffling, though whenever he appeared on camera for Mirando, you knew he was going whole hog.",Okja
5,evanston_dad,An Audacious Crowd Pleaser,9,20 December 2017,"""Okja"" certainly takes risks, and it's not always successful, but when it is....damn is it!A sort of adult fairy tale about a little girl's love for her genetically engineered pig and the corporate bigwigs who want to turn it into hot dogs, ""Okja"" is a little bit ""E.T."", a little bit ""Pete's Dragon,"" and something wholly original. It's got an inconsistent tone, and I had trouble settling into the film's strange rhythms at first. But by the time an animal rights activist group led by Paul Dano made their appearance in a dazzling and frenetic set piece that results in a destroyed shopping mall, I was hooked.Tilda Swinton plays a dual role as twin sisters who take turns leading a family corporation and who each have their own unique ideas about how said company should be run. Swinton is as usual excellent, and she manages to give yet another idiosyncratic performance that perfectly matches whatever oddball film she happens to find herself in. At the other end of the spectrum is Jake Gyllenhaal as a television celebrity animal doctor, who gives an utterly unwatchable performance that is easily the worst in the film and the worst I've ever seen Gyllenhaal give. Desperately unfunny and spastic, he threatens to ruin the whole movie, his performance is that bad. Fortunately, he isn't in the film enough to do so.The film is able to make a plea for animal rights and a call to arms against the industrialized food industry, even going as far as to draw visual parallels between it and Nazi extermination camps, without ever being preachy. No, this film is the story about the love between one girl and one pig and the outside forces that want to get in the way of it.Grade: A",Okja

7,siderite,"Joon-ho Bong does it again, better, sharper, with more meaning",9,5 July 2017,"Many remember Joon-ho Bong as the writer/director of Snowpiercer, which was a philosophical satire on society disguised as action sci- fi, however I remember it because of the Korean movie Gwoemul, in which a monster is terrorizing Seoul and a family is trying hard to find all of the members and survive at the same time. Now imagine something that combines both movies and you kind of get Okja!The film is basically about exploitation. We first see a little girl betrayed by her grandfather, manipulated with the sly and disgusting weapons of old age and authority, but then we see the same thing in a freedom movement, a corporation, a television personality, a truck driver or a receptionist that just couldn't care less, the various levels of authority all happy to wallow in their relative hierarchy and screw with the little guy. Whether is greed, a cause or simply personal spite, they form a scale of humanity where the upper levels are exploiting the lower. So kind of like Snowpiercer, but with a giant monster, which in this case is smart, kind and lovable, and an old man and his niece fighting to survive and reunite their family, like Gwoemul.The movie is two hours long and the pace is not consistent. Personally I would have removed about 15 minutes at least. Don't ask me which, though, because I loved every second of the film.",Okja
8,namashi_1,A True Action-Adventure!,9,2 July 2017,"Bong Joon-ho's 'Okja' is daring, scary & adventurous. The Writer-Director delivers a tale with such strength, it might make you want to quit from eating non-veg. You just might, you know!'Okja' Synopsis: Mija, a young girl risks everything to prevent a powerful, multi-national company from kidnapping her best friend - a massive animal named Okja.'Okja' benefits from an engrossing story, that keeps you glued to the screen. Bong and Jon Ronson's Screenplay talks about animal-cruelty with such force, its hard to not feel for Mija & Okja, who are separated by powerful people. But, the Screenplay is just stating the fact: We all eat non-veg & animal-cruelty happens all around the world. Its happening right now. So then why is it disturbing to see Okja being mistreated, only to turn into a piece of meat? Bong is intelligent enough to question ourselves & yet doesn't forget to entertain us. 'Okja' is an action-adventure, with glorious characters leading the narrative, but beneath it all, lies a question: Are we still going to allow ourselves to continue animal cruelty or do we stop? Bong's Direction is top-notch. He creates an atmosphere of chaos & tension, with precision. Darius Khondji's Cinematography is brilliant. Yang Jin-mo's Editing is razor-sharp. And Okja is an adorable creation of masterful CG work.Performance-Wise: Ahn Seo-hyun as Mija, is a wonder. The kid expresses helplessness & a sense of heroism, with astonishing results. Her affecting relationship with Okja is the emotional core of the film. Tilda Swinton, in dual roles, is at her vicious best. As 2 ruthless sisters/businesswomen, Swinton portrays her parts with gut-wrenching sharpness. Paul Dano is a scene-stealer, yet again! As the non-violent animal-activist, Dano blows up the screen with a virtuoso performance. Jake Gyllenhaal goes all-out (maybe a bit too much) in his portrayal of an eccentric zoologist and falling TV personality. Gyllenhaal crawls your skin, and for the most part, for the right reasons. Lily Collins, as a fellow animal-activist, leaves a solid impression. Others lend good support.On the whole, 'Okja' is a Mighty Winner. Do Watch And Take Your Call!",Okja
9,lasttimeisaw,a derisive navel-gazing might or might not hit the mark,7,2 July 2017,"South Korean big shot Bong Joon-ho returns with his Netflix funded and distributed, Cannes- debuted then maligned eco-concerned super pig drama OKJA, a mid-weight budgeted adventure about a South Korean farm girl Mija (Ahn), holds onto her undimmed resolution to bring her pet, the titular Okja, a gigantic genetically mutated pig, back to where they come from. Outwardly, Okja looks like a hippo-dog-pig hybrid, it is the creation of Mirando Corporation, whose CEO Lucy Mirando (Swinton) hails it to be the solution of the worldwide food shortage due to its taste and minimal wastage, exactly ten years earlier, she sent out 26 baby super-pigs all over the world and now, a decade later, its star pig Okja is being transferred back from a luxuriant Korean mountain to NYC, where a huge parade is set to inaugurate this monumental moment. That's the hype spelt out in the ex-positional opening sketches by a voluble Lucy while interlaced with the movies' opening credits, yet in hindsight, this premise doesn't quite coagulate with its plot, as we will realize, the corporation will have already possessed a giant super pig farm-cum-abattoir which is populated with numerous Okja-sized super pigs assembly-ready to be served as our daily bread by the time of the parade, is it rather self-defeating to make such booster-ism about Okja? After all, they are tons of other equally Brobdingnagian pigs at their disposal. The truth is Okja, as a highly intelligent animal, or a genuine family member to the parent-less Mija, who lives with her rustic grandfather (Byun), is not that special as we might envision, she (yes, Okja is female) is meek, ludic and wholeheartedly devoted to her master, apart from a rousing set piece where she volunteers a heroic fall to save Mija from falling off a precipice, which certifies that she is indeed more intelligent and sentient than a common pet and arguably gives her a ""soul"" so to speak, during the rest of the duration, Okja is regrettably sidelined as an unwieldy, entrapped, piteous critter waiting to be rescued from her preordained fate. In a way, she is even non-aggressive to a fault, we are so prepared to be overwhelmed by the emotional through-line between Okja and Mija, their tenacious fight for reunion (might involve some degree of sacrifice) and then maybe be happy ever after, but that is not exactly in Bong's book. What Bong plies with is something else, he is more invested in humans than in the fantasied creature, convenes an all-Hollywood supporting cast, Bong revels in his lampooning of the corporate hypocrisy, capitalistic avarice and antic mannerism, pinpointed by Tilda Swinton's marvelous dual-presence of evil-twins Lucy and Nancy (one takes a pseudo-humanistic masquerade to sate her ego boost and the other is unqualifiedly money-seeking), and Jake Gyllenhaal's unrecognizable impersonation of a mad-doctor-and-squeaking-compère combo, so hysterical sometimes it borders on cringe-worthy. Meantime, through the prism of the ultimately ineffectual but wacky actions of Animal Liberation Front (ALF), lead by an utterly sincere Paul Dano, a credo-abiding martinet who indoctrinates us ""translation is ABSOLUTELY sacred!"", barbs are also thrown to the activist front, it is laudable to stick to one's ideology out of one's noble conscience, but do they have a well-conceived plan for the aftermath? Let's say, even if they can free all the Okjas, where can they survive? Maybe Bong should have mentioned that there are some super-pig sanctuary somewhere. The best part of this alternately flippant/serious escapade remains in Bong's motherland, namely, the rampage scenes in Seoul and its idyllic panorama, where the film takes pains to give Mija some action to complete, not that exasperating but helpless rubbernecker when transported to USA. In conclusion, on the one hand we cannot help but chuckling to the pragmatic solution which ends Mija's pursuit, because it is so tongue-in-cheek yet also brilliantly refreshing, on the other hand, it painfully reminds us our world is in deep mess right now, and OKJA offers no comfort, no alleviation, no redemption, only derisive navel-gazing might or might not hit the mark.",Okja
10,Red-Barracuda,"Original, if uneven, comic creature-feature",6,26 June 2017,"Boon Joon-ho is a director who can always be relied upon to deliver something a bit different. Films such as The Host (2006) and Snowpiercer (2013) were movies which took what could otherwise be standard genre ideas into new oddball directions. Like the former film, Okja is a creature-feature, except in this case the creature is entirely benign and lovable – it's kind of a Steven Spielberg type of idea, except Spielberg was (in)famous for making high concept movies (films whose plot can be described in a single sentence) and, well, the story of Okja is pretty seriously far removed from being high concept. A young Korean girl Mija lives in the mountains with her grandfather and her giant genetically engineered super-pig called Okja. When the Mirando corporation who made the pig take him back to New York, Mija joins forces with a group of animal rights activists to save Okja from a terrible fate.The above synopsis only sort of describes this one because there really is a lot more going on here. There are many ideas embedded in the mix. Probably too many ideas really, as the overall result is not very cohesive. I would say for sure that the parts add up to more than the whole. But you can't knock the ambition and the resultant film is somewhat unusual that's for sure. In truth, this is decidedly strange for a big budget effects film with a tone that is all over the map. In many ways, it feels like it should be a kid's movie, kind of like a live-action version of a Studio Ghibli animated movie, i.e. the adventures of a little girl and her giant pig best friend. But this is offset with f-bombs going off freely and some heavy topics being covered in the latter part of the story. The tone of the movie could perhaps best be described ascurious.On the one hand, this is a knockabout action-comedy but on the other, it is satirical and has serious points to make about genetically modified foods and the industrial slaughter of animals for food consumption. As I say, the odd combination gives the movie a distinctive edge, but it doesn't necessarily work fully. I felt that it often played a surer hand when it went down an action-orientated route, such as the excellently executed chase through Seoul which culminates with a giant pig running through a shopping mall – in fairness, when have you seen that before? The film also has a trio of established actors putting in good work, namely Tilda Swinton in a double role as twin CEOs of the Mirando corporation, Jake Gyllenhaal is a self-important TV wildlife presenter and Paul Dano as an excessively earnest animal rights leader. On-the-whole, I found this one to be a bit uneven but I cannot deny that it is bursting with ideas and it certainly qualifies as an impressively left-field example of an effects driven movie.",Okja
11,Hellmant,"Being a huge animal lover, and vegan, I absolutely love this film.",10,6 July 2017,"'OKJA': Five Stars (Out of Five) A South Korean-American fantasy adventure directed by Bong Joon Ho, and written by Bong and Jon Ronson (Bong has previously performed both duties on such internationally popular movies as 'SNOWPIERCER', 'MOTHER' and 'THE HOST'). It tells the story of a young girl that's desperately trying to rescue her animal friend from a very powerful multi-national corporation. The film stars An Seo Hyun, Tilda Swinton, Paul Dano, Jake Gyllenhaal, Steven Yeun, Lilly Collins, Byun Heebong and Giancarlo Esposito. It's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's been released on Netflix through their streaming site. I absolutely loved it! Mirando Corporation is a massive multi-national business that's trying out a new PR stunt, in order to sell an experimental kind of meat to the public. They're sending a special kind of large pig around the world, to various places, in order to have them raised in different ways (and cultures) and see which pig produces the best kind of meat. A little girl, named Mija (Hyun), bonds with a super pig, she calls Okja, which she helps raise on her South Korean family farm. When the company wants to take Okja away, ten years later, she passionately attempts to save him (and travels to America in order to do so). She receives help (unexpectedly) from a heroic team of ALF animal rights activists, lead by Jay (Dano).Being a huge animal lover, and vegan, I absolutely love this film. The filmmakers say it was not their original goal, when they started making the movie, to try to convert viewers to a plant based diet. They also say though, that they can now definitely see why the film would inspire viewers to do so, especially younger viewers (which are the movie's target audience). Bong also became a vegan for the film's entire production (and now he's a pescatarian), so you can definitely see the heart and passion that went into making this movie such a beautiful work of art. That's what I love the most about it; it's masterful passion. The film also has some really talented actors in it (Gyllenhaal, Dano, Swinton, Collins, etc.), all giving great performances, and the direction is absolutely breathtaking to watch too. It's a very beautiful and powerful film (especially the stunning and emotionally charged climax), and I think everyone, of almost any age, should definitely see it! It's one of the year's very best films.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/Mg3uG2FLNSE",Okja
12,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Food for thought.,8,16 March 2020,"Like with all of Bong Joon Ho's work, 'Okja (2017)' transcends all notion of genre. It's at once a farcical comedy and a harrowing horror, a satire that takes aim at the very heart of the global food industry. It finds fun in its high jinks and sorrow in its themes, as effective at one as it is the other. It's an entertaining film, bouncing between enjoyable and off-putting, and it's remarkably compelling, too. Its madcap appearance, and performances, belie its serious soul; it really does have some poignant things to say. Yes, it's about a CG super pig, but it's a mature and effective story right from the start. 8/10",Okja
13,ThomasDrufke,Goofy but Heartfelt,8,9 October 2017,"Ever since I got a dog, I've become so much more aware of the canine creatures in every film I see. Okja isn't a dog, instead a ""super pig"", but she's very much treated like a dog. And when a film is centered around the well-being of a dog-like creature, it's very difficult to not become attached to the animal. Heck, I was attached to the dog in The Mountain Between Us, and that movie was horrible. With all that said, Okja does a nice job of balancing the inevitable manipulative emotions that come from having a lovable animal with the weight of a serious subject matter like animal rights. It's that balance where Okja really shines.Okja boasts a wonderfully diverse cast, led by newcomer Seo-Hyun Ahn, who plays Okja's early-teen owner, Mija. She's joined by Tilda Swinton, Giancarlo Esposito, Paul Dano, Lily Collins, Steven Yeun, and Jake Gyllenhaal. The story follows Mija's quest to bring Okja back to her farm home in South Korea, as the original breeders of Okja attempt to take her in for examinations and experiments. What follows is a surprisingly emotional turn of a events as Mija does everything she can, including traveling across the world, to set Okja free.So in that way, it's a brilliantly poignant take on animal rights, with an immediate connection watching a young girl and her best friend, who just happens to be a super massive pig. On the other- hand, the tone set by Snowpierecer director Joon-Ho Bong can sometimes be jarring. As much as I love me some Jake Gyllenhaal, it feels like he's in a completely different movie than everyone else. You have a serious film about animal rights and what some of the consequences are for them in the meat industry and yet Gyllenhaal is running around acting like he's in an Ace Ventura film. Obviously an intentional direction from Bong, but it's still very jarring.Luckily, Mija and Okja's relationship is incredibly charming and easily relatable, so the tone jumps don't severely impact the enjoyment of the film. I found myself legitimately caring for these super pigs and devastated when they were ""taken care of"". As a meat-eater, it's sure going to be difficult to eat hot dogs anytime soon. But in all seriousness, Okja is a sweet story led by mostly great performances and a memorable relationship between a girl and her dog (super pig). There's not much not to like about Okja.8.4/10",Okja
14,gbill-74877,Bong Joon-ho delivers again,8,14 June 2020,"A wild film with a heart of gold. As in his other films, Bong Joon-ho takes a topic of great relevance - in this case, animal rights and GMO - and creates a fantasy scenario that pushes the boundaries of storytelling to get his points in while entertaining us. The satire of corporate executives here is brilliant, and the glimpse into the meat industry is incredibly timely, with veganism/vegetarianism on the rise (for good reason!). Man, it's as if Bong Joon-ho can do no wrong, and consistently makes movies which are creative, fun, and important.This is a beautiful film and it has a soulful performance from Ahn Seo-hyun, the girl who grew up tending Okja, a ""superpig."" I loved its elements of comedy, though some bits (like the ""this is what corporate loyalty is!"" moment) work better than others (like Jake Gyllenhaal hitting those high notes with the bizarre voice he gives his character). The special effects are quite good too, especially when Okja rumbles through an underground train station. The climax of the movie distills things down into a pretty contrived scenario but at the end of the day, it's accurate in portraying profit as ultimately the only thing business cares about, and in the cruelty of factory farming and the slaughterhouse. It tugs on the emotions but there are some seriously dark bits here, and they're based in reality. A near miss for an even higher rating.",Okja
15,Cineanalyst,Cartoon Commentary,6,13 December 2019,"This is only the third movie of his I've seen, but it's readily apparent that Bong Joon-ho is a masterful filmmaker. Unfortunately, the writer-director also seems to have a tendency towards delivering heavy-handed social commentary, and, unlike the others I've seen thus far (""Snowpiercer"" (2013) and ""Parasite"" (2019)), this one is overburdened with sentiment. Mawkish message movies are generally too uncomplicated--repeatedly hammering emotional appeals instead of trusting the audience's intelligence with any ambiguities or intricacies. So, here, ""Okja"" champions the bond between a girl and her titular superpig, a new species that seems to look and act as much like a dog as it does ""Babe"" (1995) and whose personality and intelligence is otherwise quite human. Assuredly, that's intentional, for us to become invested in the CGI character. Film has been appealing to dog lovers since, at least, Rin Tin Tin and animating anthropomorphic beasts as far back as ""Gertie the Dinosaur"" (1914). ""Okja"" is like an outrageous version of the sort of kiddie fare Disney might make.Stranger still is that ""Okja"" is a fanciful picture but it appropriates some famous and seemingly-unrelated imagery from real life in its satire of a pork-manufacturing company. For instance, there's the imitation of the ""Situation Room"" photograph of the Obama administration viewing the mission to kill Osama bin Laden, as, here, Tilda Swinton's CEO and other executives watch their Miranda Corporation receiving bad press coverage. Later, a slaughterhouse resembles the Auschwitz concentration camp.Unless you're interested in didactic lecturing from a movie on the merits or lack thereof of genetically-engineered food or veganism, or another tale of rustic life as good and city and industry as bad, which I'm not, there isn't much more that's sophisticated in ""Okja."" Sometimes, it's a thrilling and spectacular picture merely to look at, though. The creature is effectively animated, to the point that she's less cartoonish than the cast of baddies led by stars Swinton, in twin roles, and Jake Gyllenhall. My favorite sequence is when Okja is running loose through Seoul, which serves as a nice contrast to her earlier frolicking about in nature. The rampage through a shopping center, including the subsequent slow motion, is a highlight.",Okja
16,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,7,16 August 2017,"Okja When the world runs out of food the starving masses will have you choice but to eat at Arby's.Thankfully, the scientists in this fantasy are devising new food sources. A greedy CEO (Tilda Swinton) creates and disperses a race of super-pigs across the globe that she hopes will someday feed the multitudes and make her millions.Ten years later, Okja, the super-sized swine adopted by a South Korean girl (Ahn Seo-hyun), grabs headlines when she becomes embroiled in a battle between the company's crazed zoologist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and animal rights activists (Paul Dano, Lily Collins) trying to liberate her from slaughter.An eclectic parable of the meat industry marinated in oddball performances, this quirky Korean import pads its vegetarian agenda with twee moments between pig and owner that are brutally punctuated by the grim reality of the food chain.

17,nairtejas,Capsule Review: Okja,7,20 October 2017,"Had the animal in Okja not been an imaginary being and instead an animal that you are familiar with, you wouldn't care much for this social drama. It reminds you that slaughterhouses are not just sources where your morning bacon come from but also a business for hard- hearted corporates that engage in ruthless husbandry and genetic modification for money. Led by two cartoony characters - a human being and an adorable little animal - Okja is part adventure, part drama as it goes on to highlight the essence of vegetarianism and how being animal-loving can benefit the environment and its fauna. Corporate indifference is at the center of the show here, thanks to the menacing and incredible Tilda Swinton in not one but two roles equally psychopathic. How can one portray a character so evil that it starts to create a new definition for the word, snatching it from the nemesis of our dear Austin Powers? Supported by a talented cast, including the unknown faces and my favorite Jake Gyllenhaal for delivering a rambunctious performance, the film travels smoothly through fun adventures in a jungle, truck chases in a busy Seoul street, and the simple and charismatic relationship between two souls.

18,paulclaassen,"Cute with amazing visuals, but so many plot flaws.",6,16 June 2018,"Okja's insanely good visuals are no doubt the draw card for this fantasy comedy-drama. Once I was used to the stunning visuals and the beyond-cute Okja pig, I found the film itself very slow moving with a sense of deja vu more often than not, as if the film was moving in circles. It was also not credible at all to see how little security and staff there were at the Miranda facilities, keeping in mind the secret nature of their operation. A young girl easily gained access to every restricted area without being seen or captured. Not believable. It played like a Disney family TV movie for a young audience. Having said that, I did enjoy the film, and loved the absolutely beautiful ending!",Okja
19,Floated2,Coming of age story with some flaws,6,1 July 2017,"Okja is a recent Netflix original film made by director Joon-ho Bong. His latest film Snowpiercer is a one of a kind interesting tale. For fans alike there were much hype going into this film, knowing what he has done in the past. Okja is a completely different film in comparison to Snowpiercer. This is more of a coming of age film where it feels like a Disney/kids movie but filtered with a lot of foul language. The entire plot and tone of the film feels as if it's centered and made for children or young teens, but many of the supporting characters use foul language giving it an R rating. I think they could have toned down the language a lot and the film would have been the same in tone, as this very well could have been rated PG-13 or even PG.Within the film, Okja is relatively a coming of age story, where it appears to be unique seeing a young orphan girl having raised a large genetic pig-like creature named Okja, then having it taken away from her due to a large corporation. The performance of the leading girl is a standout. Tilda Swinton plays her character decent, as the co- lead, as well as Paul Dano and his crew of animal protectors. Jake Gyllenhaal appears to be miscast as his performance is over the top and is the weakest point of the film. The film is relatively interesting in the first act with some moments in the second act but some parts do not spark interest as they should. It does share a very interesting and profound message but isn't it something we have seen before? Perhaps this is the type of film that better on another viewing.",Okja
20,eddie_baggins,A film about a giant pig that's a little to hammy,5,30 July 2017,"Over the period of a decade, Korean based Joon-ho Bong has established himself as one of the most unique directors working in the industry today.From his Seoul based monster hit The Host, through to his hugely divisive Sci-Fi Snowpiercer from 2013 (a film that you should check out right away if you haven't already), Bong knows how to tell a story and develop visuals and knows how to do so without a care for being run of the mill.Continuing on this tradition of the odd yet wondrous, Bong's new Netflix and Brad Pitt's production company Plan B's film Okja, that had a controversial screening at this year's Cannes Film Festival, has burst into lounge rooms across the globe and captivated people's hearts thanks to a lovable CGI pig/hippopotamus and her best friend Mija, who end up going on a world spanning adventure from their scenic farmland in South Korea to the bustling metropolis of New York City.It's a simplistic rundown of a film that flirts the line between whimsical family film to dark (far too dark for young children) essay on the state of mankind's carefree approach to animal welfare and the very way in which we abuse the planet we live on.Clearly under the banner of Netflix, who seem happy to allow filmmakers creative freedom, which no doubt a reason they are attracting more and more quality to their original staples, Bong has gone all out with Okja and used an impressive budget to craft a beautifully realised CGI'd Okja and recruit an A-list cast but despite the films wins there are too many downfalls holding Okja back from the greatness some have labelled it to have achieved.First of all Okja's uneven tone can often be too jarring, with one scene playing out awkwardly for laughs, to the next becoming an instantly emotionally grabbing exercise in glumness. Often tonal shifts can work in a film but Okja's slightly amiss narrative that includes Paul Dano's welfare activist group, Jake Gyllenhaal's far to OTT TV host Johnny Wilcox and Tilda Swinton's crazed CEO Lucy Mirando gets lost within itself far too often and while it's great Bong has lost none of his zaniness or ability to create a story with a difference, you almost wish Okja was a little less crazy, as its quiet moments are some of its most effective.While all the car chases, animal rights issues and parade interruptions make Okja feel larger in scale, Okja is at its best when we are allowed time with Okja and Mija, whose played impressively by newcomer Seo-Hyun Ahn, an actress that seems at home acting alongside A-listers or a CGI creation, suggesting a bright future ahead for the young performer.Watching these two memorable screen creations go about their business on screen together showcases how simple yet affecting Okja is when its focus is turned on and its script is less concerned with going for broke.Final Say – An odd and sometimes genuinely charming experience that gets overtaken far too often by a complicated story, hammy performances from its Hollywood cast and a script that could've used a polish, Okja is a streaming event sure to be a favourite of many but a disappointing and scattered experience from Bong after the highs of The Host and Snowpiercer.2 ½ eventful street parades out of 5",Okja

My main concern was the special effects that, if they weren't as good, would have ruined the movie, but they were actually good. The performances were really good as well, and the language switching was okay for me, but I'm used to watching Korean movies as well as western, so it wasn't something new for me, but I can see why some people might get bothered.

We purchase pre-packaged goods and we don't know where they came from, how they were made, or what chemicals are inside them.The movie takes a simple girl who has a connection to a very, very large pig which was being developed for mass production. The pig was supposed to be a way to stop world hunger. An answer to the human food problem, along with producing less methane, using less feed, and producing more edible meat in a short period of time.That's all good for humans, but what are you sacrificing to get it?This is a very good movie even through all the mistakes in production.

23,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Another distinctive film from Bong Joon-ho about wholesome values vs. society's self-interest,8,30 June 2017,"A teenage girl wants nothing more than to remain with her lifelong pet and companion – the super pig Okja – in Korean auteur Bong Joon- ho's latest film. Everything else is just stuff that gets in the way.Bong delivers one of Netflix's better high profile original films in ""Okja,"" a quirky yet topical yet big-hearted film. Similar to Bong's 2006 breakout film ""The Host,"" a monster movie about a doltish dad who will do anything to rescue his daughter, ""Okja"" plays to family themes (a girl and her pet) but presents them through a mature, adult lens (corporate greed, environmentalism, genetic science). So the context of ""Okja"" is complicated, but the story is quite simple and human. 14-year-old Mija (An Seo-hyun) has lived with her grandfather on a mountainside farm in South Korea for most of her life with Okja, a super pig gifted to the farm by Lucy Mirando (Tilda Swinton) and the Mirando Corporation as part of a competition to develop the pigs as a non-GMO food source to help fight hunger. When the corporation and super pig judge Johnny Wilcox (Jake Gyllenhaal) come to collect, Okja is clearly the finest of the super pigs in the world, and they endeavor to take her to New York City. Mija follows them to Seoul and attempts to get her friend back, coming up against the corporation and a group of animal rights activists, all of which have different agendas for Okja.Hilarious and deeply disturbing, violent but also quite warm, Bong has created another distinctive film that makes him one of the most interesting filmmakers that not enough people are talking about. The mixed bag of tones will certainly turn off viewers who aren't sure what to do with a film that doesn't fit in any one neatly labeled genre box, those with an open mind will appreciate the way he tells extremely accessible stories that address complicated themes.Okja means a lot of things to a lot of people: friendship and stability to Mija; money, science and reputation to the Mirando Corporation; injustice and corporate greed to the animal liberation group; and affordable food to the masses. The plot is essentially these competing interests sorting themselves out.Part of what makes ""Okja"" distinctive is the caricaturized supporting roles that make everything feel just a shade unusual. As she did in Bong's last film, ""Snowpiercer,"" Swinton so effortlessly creates a wildly larger than life character portrait that simultaneously feels grounded in reality. Gyllenhaal, on the other hand, is infuriatingly grating as the eccentric loose cannon TV personality, but his character is a signal to the audience of how to look at and think of the world of the film. Bong has such a specific perspective on society that comes through in way subtle and not in ""Okja."" He brilliantly whittles the story down to one pivotal moment at the end, and the outcome of all this chaos suggests he's neither pessimistic nor optimistic. Perhaps he would argue that it's not his business to come down one way or another, but simply to use a giant hippo-like pig to at least prove that our world is majorly – and maybe unnecessarily – complicated~Steven CThanks for reading!

24,Vartiainen,About the darker side of consumerism,6,29 March 2020,"Okja is the name of a specially-bred ""superpig"", one of many, who have been created to revolutionize the meat industry. Bit of a slow-burning plan however because it takes ten years for the first few pigs to grow up. Okja being one of them, growing up on a distant Korean mountainside. But then the meat packagers, Okja's creators, come back for their property.Director Bong Joon-ho is more known for his social dramas focusing on class boundaries, but he has dived into science fiction before. Most notably with Snowpiercer. Okja is a bit lighter in tone than that one, more like a fairytale. It's still off-puttingly dark in certain places, especially near the end, but for most of the duration, it's not so bad. Caricatured and exaggerated, certainly, but not so bad.Where the film falls short, in my opinion, is the execution. It's a weird story idea to begin with, but nothing much is done with it. Not helping is the fact that the message of the story is so obvious and chewed. Eating meat is bad, capitalism is bad, industry is bad. Nature is good, small farms are good, animals are good, living simple lives is good. It's not a bad message, but it's so blatantly shoved down our throats that you end up rebelling against it as reaction.Still, at least it was a unique viewing experience. You don't see story like this every day. And for that it earns some points.",Okja
25,billcr12,Wow,8,13 December 2017,"What a surprise as one of the best films of the year from a Korean writer and director. A ten year-old girl is given a genetically engineered pig to raise . She lives in Korea and so much of the movie is in that language with English subtitles. The pig follows her through the mountains, much like a pet dog. Tilda Swinton leads an evil American GMO company (Monsanto might sue) and she lies to the press, claiming that the bovine are all naturally bred. The planet is bursting, with over seven billion people and so the giant sausage factories are the answer. It develops into a typical good vs. evil, David and Goliath story. The little girl is great and the giant pig is the star here. The scenery in the Korean hills and valleys is breathtaking and the Rocky like atmosphere works well. It is unfortunate that Okja was not released to theaters and was only seen on Netflix. Film distribution has changed the industry forever. I just hope Okja will get the audience it so richly deserves.",Okja
26,jamesrupert2014,A technically outstanding but otherwise mediocre film,6,11 July 2017,"""Okja"" is a heavy-handed and somewhat simplistic critique of the meat industry in which, due to a highly contrived plot, a young girl's beloved pet 'super-pig' ends up at the abattoir. The satire is neither subtle (I assume that ""Mirando"" was as close to ""Monsanto"" as the producers' lawyers would allow) nor clever (the wicked capitalists are just stupid and greedy strawmen) and the characters played by Jake Gyllenhaal and Tilda Swinton are over-the-top to a point of being almost unwatchable. These weakness are unfortunate, because if the story, script and acting were up to the level of the outstanding special effects, the movie might have become a classic children's film. The take-home message of ""Okja"" is pretty blatant and judging by some of the gushing comments about this film, director Joon-ho Bong was often 'preaching to the choir', but I don't think that the film is either clever or 'real' enough to actually change peoples' minds about meat (""Babe"" didn't and an actual piglet is a more sympathetic character than a CGI hippo-pig, however well rendered (excuse the pun)). Also undermining the story and the message is the frequent and gratuitous use of profanity, which seems to have been included more for cheap laughs than for story or character development, and seems out of place in what struck me as basically a movie for the kids.",Okja

28,CubsandCulture,The weakest of Bong Joon Ho's anticapital polemics,8,9 December 2020,"I ended up being disappointed in this film. Both Snowpiercer and Parasite are far sharper in their social commentary and pointedly they don't stack the deck in their narratives against the film's target. That is not true here and it is the source of much of my disappointment. The film is meant to be fable about how factory farming is ""cruel"" to livestock. The film makes the points unfairly in two ways. All the big corporation people are grotesque with nary any displays of common humanity. Johnny Wilcox (Gyllenhaal) is especially a damaged human being. Second, Okja and the other ""superpigs"" are given an absurd level of intelligence to make them seem like people. (animals are not people and animals should not have rights) One of the earliest story beats is Okja solving a complex physics problem while under duress. It is an inartful and unfair way to argue for animal rights. So much so I think the central critique fails. I after all had a ham sandwich after watching the film.With that said the movie is still very engaging. Bong Joon Ho has an amazing sense of how to-logically-yank a story in such an unexpected directions. He shows off that skill a few times here. Likewise, the film is just lovely to look at and Bong Joon Ho does well enough at balancing the various tonalities of the story to make a funny, frightening and lovely film all at once. The film is at its best when it is merely the story of a young girl and her animal friend. Much of the film is precisely that and I can recommend it along those lines. It is just not as layered or insightful as other works.",Okja
29,iquine,Lovable Super Pig Tale or Anti-Factory Farm Social Commentary,8,4 October 2018,"(Flash Review)The movie opens with a peculiarly large mammal playing with a young girl in the jungle. Turns out this was a super pig creation through a competition TV show touting the benefits of genetically modified animals. This one, Okja was created in a mountain farming village in South Korea. Of course AGRO (Big Agriculture Corp.) is behind the GMO pig competition and they crown a 1st prize which is Okja. While they transport Okja to New York, an attempted theft of the pig is attempted by a comically non-violent PETA-type group. This kicks off an animal rights vs big corporation satirical battle for Okja. The pig animation is really good and overall movie production quality is high. Of course the big corporation is modeled after Monsanto and all the big wigs are stereotypically dense and uncaring. It was a quirky little adventure film showing the girl's emotions for Okja. They didn't need to layer on the factory farm = bad quite so thickly. It sort of took you out of the movie from fantasy to social issue and the point was easily made early on.",Okja

33,I_Ailurophile,Immediately and lastingly captivating,10,19 June 2021,"I had high expectations, and they were still handily exceeded: 'Okja' is an impossibly outstanding film.Writer Jon Ronson has some very notable credits to his name, and writer-director Bong Joon-ho has more than proven himself with an unparalleled resumé of phenomenal full-length features. Together they have crafted a tale that is poignant and grabbing from the moment it begins, and which never deviates from that excellence. It had my attention with the first scene, and I fell in love upon the second.The first scene, preceding opening credits, provides all necessary exposition for 'Okja' in the form of a New York press conference as charismatic entrepreneur Lucy Mirando (Tilda Swinton) lays out her vision for the future of industrial agriculture with a program breeding ""super pigs."" Set aglow by the bright spotlight upon her stark white outfit, Swinton immediately illustrates a ferocious force of personality, her stature a dazzling contrast to the giant, dirty, unseemly factory setting around her.The second scene takes us to the mountain far outside Seoul where willful Mija (Ahn Seo-hyun) lives in great happiness with Okja, the super pig given to her grandfather Heebong (repeat Bong collaborator Byun Hee-bong) as part of the Mirando corporate program. The scenery is lush, green, and gorgeous, and these moments impart the deep bond that Mija and Okja share. Fantastical a creature as the super pig may be, she looks great as a creation of computer rendering, and in her characterization illustrates the astounding intelligence of this new breed of porcine. This setting, in its tranquility, is a pointed contrast to the dingy hues of the space that preceded it in our vision.And then the great adventure begins, as Mirando takes Okja away with less than favorable intentions, and Mija follows after her in a valiant rescue effort. Along the way Mija encounters the stubbornly inhuman reality of a megacorporation, the hopeful call to action of animal rights activists, the oppressive brutality of police and private security - and the sickening horror of industrialized agriculture and meat production. For every sparing moment of levity, demonstration of Mija's resolve, and spark of light seen in the intent of the Animal Liberation Front, they provide counterbalance we struggle ever more fervently to focus on in the face of the grim spectacle underlying the narrative. 'Okja' is unquestionably a dark comedy, but as the story progresses toward its climax, it feels much more like a very inescapable tragedy.Through it all, Bong again effortlessly demonstrates his finely tuned eye as a director. Whatever the setting, scene, or circumstances, he builds countless eye-catching shots. Whether it's a view from above of Mija in a crowd; the rural, wild beauty of the mountain; or the varied humanity - however virtuous or diabolical - of individual characters: Bong arranges exquisite moments that capture the imagination. He's aided in that drive to great effect by composer Jung Jae-il, whose original music superbly complements every scene. The serenity of the mountain, the madcap energy of Mija and Okja's early romp in Seoul, the sorrow of the separated pair's increasingly desperate situation, or the terrible dread of Mirando's processing plant - all are realized ever more vividly with Jung's arrangements. Most any film would be bereft without its music, naturally, but here it is such a great boost that it's especially notable.And the cast is extraordinary. Swinton and Ahn get the most focused time on screen and demonstrate very well why they were cast in such prominent roles, but they're far from alone. Jake Gyllenhaal puts in a wild caricature of a performance as TV zoologist-turned-corporate shill Johnny Wilcox. Steven Yeun, Lily Collins, and especially Paul Dano are all superb, giving their ALF activists very strong, commanding, and different personalities. And while the roles given to Giancarlo Esposito and Shirley Henderson are more of the supporting variety, it's a joy to see them here; both give their characters an unexpectedly dominant disposition, and whether by visage or voice are very recognizable.I shouldn't have been surprised at the turns 'Okja' takes - Bong's films consistently begin with a relatively simple premise before becoming something much more. So it is here, too, as the bond shared between Mija and her companion takes a minor sense of adventure and grows it into a far wider, more harrowing, and exceptionally darker tale. It's not easy to watch. But the narrative is very well written, as are the characters and dialogue. As unwelcoming as later story beats become, at all times we remain immersed in the saga playing out before us. The peacefulness of the final scene is a gratifying denouement after all we've watched, and the last shot simply perfect.This is a movie that animal lovers should approach with a mindful gaze; though the super pigs are fictitious, the way they are treated is very real. Still, with that in mind, Bong Joon-ho's skill as a film-maker remains nearly unrivaled in my mind; this is yet another marvelous feature, however trying it may be. From writing and music to acting and music and beyond, 'Okja' is a truly outstanding picture that is well worth watching.",Okja

35,jadepietro,Leftovers,3,6 August 2017,"(RATING: ☆½ out of 5)GRADE: D+ THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A satire bereft of wit and humor with some of the worst acting of the year.SYNOPSIS: A girl and her pet pig try to survive this cruel world.JIM'S REVIEW: Now streaming on Netflix and available in DVD format is Bong Joon-ho's film parable to animal rights, Okja. It tells its bittersweet story of a young Korean girl, Mija (played winning by An Seo Hyun) and her mighty big pig. Okja is a genetically modified (and CGI enhanced) lovable swine. Mija and her grandfather have raised Okja from a piglet with loving care. Okja and 26 other porkers are now up for the global title of Super Pig of the Year, sponsored by the Mirando Corporation. Well, Okja may be smart, loyal, and cute (in a piggy sort of way), but all her resources will be tested if she is to survive.￼Having the talents of Tilda Swinton, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Paul Dano in your movie immediately signals to the audience that this film will have a special surreal and off-kilter edge and result in a definite message. And, of course, it does. Unfortunately, it quickly goes off track and never finds the right tone or rhythm. While some of the images are engrossing, the story goes into absurd territory and collapses with all of its convoluted subplots and chase scenes. (One plus: Darius Khondji lens the movie and hides the film's ineptitude with his strong photographic skills.)Okja is its own pu pu platter, an assortment of serious and comedic moments that keep changing in its overall vision. It starts as a gentle love story and progresses to a graphic condemnation of corporate greed and man's domination over our four-legged friends. (Be forewarned: Some of the images are extremely grisly and graphic to watch in the latter parts of the film.)￼The film tries to use satire to tell its tale about the big bad world of carnivores and their insatiable appetite for pork, before losing its comedic edge and letting its ire steadily grow to its blood-soaked conclusion. The screenplay by Jon Ronson and the director may have noble intentions but their execution is labored and lacks any resemblance of wit. It makes no logic sense as Mija globe-trots to save her prized pig from the evil forces of big business.￼The CGI is average at best, with the Super Pig out-acting the human performers. Let's talk about the cast. The acting is a multitude of embarrassments. Some of the actors give their worst performances...ever! Ms. Swinton plays two characters and neither of them well. Mr. Dano looks absent-minded and lost in his poorly written character, a liberally-minded animal rights activist that wants to protect Okja...sometimes. Worst of all is the talented Mr. Gyllenhaal, playing a fey mad scientist. He is so over-the-top, a walking Looney Tunes cartoon. Only Giancarlo Esposito comes out of this mess of a film unscathed.￼This is no sausage party! Even members of PETA might partake of a spare rib or two after seeing this dud. Avoid the scraps! Okja is just awful.NOTE: If you want to see a better film on the subject, rent Babe.",Okja

(TV-MA)Oh, just another story of a girl and her superpig. The Mirando Corporation has bred a new animal (think: a pig-like hippopotamus) that will one day be used to feed the hungry at a much smaller ecological footprint, but Okja, raised in the mountains of Korea, means too much to young Mija (Seo-hyun) to let her become a prize animal to be gawked at and slaughtered without a fight. Another imaginative, ambitious and eclectic effort from Joon-ho; a bit ungainly at times, shifting tones at several junctures (sometimes adroit, sometimes abrupt), and its angle on radical animal rights activism gets muddled along the way, but even at its messiest, always distinctive. Like Gollum, King Kong, et al, it doesn't take long before the pixels that make up Okja start taking on the substance of real flesh, and she's a real soulful sweetheart. Seo-hyun preserves the emotional center, Swinton gets to ply her arch and eccentric trade, but Gyllenhaal's miscalculated bizarro performance is showy in the worst ways (like a mugging Jim Carrey at his most obnoxious), and he goes further afield each time he shows up on screen.

It's a relatable 'hero's journey' type of story but with some nice stylistic twists thrown around here and there thanks to Bong Joon-ho's direction giving an honest take on animal lovers, agriculture and the inevitable catch-22's that come with people fighting for and against animal rights, industrial cruelty and moral perseverance.

40,baumer,A must see film,10,26 July 2017,"A stunning film. I was told that it is hard to get a strong voice about animals made into a film. Hollywood doesn't want to touch it. Well Hollywood might be afraid of it but when you have Brad Pitt, a strong advocate for veganism and animal welfare, producing the film and a pariah and new power player on the block like Netflix willing to distribute, then you get a film like Okja made. Then you add a terrific international cast like Paul Dano, Steven Yuen, Tilda Swinton and the star of the movie, Seo-Hyun Ahn plus a superstar Korean director like Joon-ho Bong and you have one hell of a film. For those who don't know, Bong directed the highest grossing South Korean movie of all time, The Host and he also did the well received Snowpiercer. Make no mistake about it, this film has a strong representation behind and in front of the camera. And this is a film that is not only a strong voice, but it is one that is needed. I'm a strong advocate for animal welfare and this film is up there as one of the best fictional films I've ever seen about the topic. You have a giant corporation that has made genetically modified super pigs. These pigs have grown to be massive animals, perhaps twenty times the size of normal pigs. They send these pigs off to live in all different corners of the world and their plan is to ten years later see which pig is the best and then parade him in New York city as part of a promotion to buy this corporation's new meat. Okja lives with Mija on her tiny farm in South Korea. They have a vast land where Okja and Mija have formed a bond. The corporation comes by, takes Okja and plans to kill him and all the other super pigs in a few days. Enter the ALF which plans on saving Okja. There's many strengths of the film. I'll just mention a few of them. The cast is brilliant. I enjoyed Steven Yuen especially. He has a screen presence, even when he was on the Walking Dead, you could feel it. He is very strong here. Paul Dano is excellent as well and Tilda Swinton might be the best actress alive who can play a bitch, someone you just despise. Ahn is priceless as the young girl and she sells the relationship with Okja. But an animal welfare movie about pigs being sent to slaughter wouldn't be complete without the horrors that must be shown. There are very disturbing abattoir scenes and it's quite graphic. There's also a fair bit of animal mistreatment and for someone like me, someone who strongly advocates animal welfare, these scenes were very tough to watch. But they were necessary and they add to the overall tone of the movie.Okja is perhaps the best film I've seen this year. It does everything right and it will probably help me become a vegan instead of just vegetarian. I applaud Netflix for getting this film made.10/10",Okja
41,sharky_55,"All edible, except the squeal.",7,2 July 2017,"It's a classic story: girl meets gigantic super pig, they become best friends, tragedy separates them, only for the girl to undertake a heroic journey to find the captors and reunite with her animal pal. If you've watched the trailers for Okja, you'll be quick to point fingers at the antagonistic Mirando Corporation, the ones behind this genetic breeding of super pigs for mass consumption. And if you know the past work of director Bong Joon-Ho, you'll also be aware that his particular brand of didacticism is usually disguised within genre film conventions. In Snowpiercer, an action thriller on a high-speed train doubled as an allegorical tale for class inequality. And in The Host, American environmental recklessness materialised into monster form, chasing and swallowing innocent Korean citizens and dividing the nuclear family like an anti-Spielbergian fable. Far from being simply a jab at America's carelessness in dumping toxic waste into the Han River (based partly on a true event in Seoul), the latter had subversion built into its style, with sweeping slow motion moments crashing down on the heels of its terrified victims and misguided heroes (the grandfather, whose actor plays a similar role in Okja, dies a sudden, unceremonious death in sacrifice) until we are almost prone to laughter. There's a delightful scene in Okja along the same lines, a slow motion frenzy of cheap plastic and blood over John Denver's Annie's Song, as the villains with guns and tranquillisers come up against the masked rebels wielding colourful umbrellas. The result is enough to wring a wry smile out of almost viewer. The bag of tricks that is Okja juggles rollicking action, low-brow humour and satire of farcical lengths as it follows little Mija in her quest to be reunited with her pet. Look no further than the opening sequence, in which Joon-Ho paints a striking portrait of a multi-national company interacting with the press. Mirando Corp's big news is less a press release and more a talent show, with spotlights, flashy animations and a garishly-dressed Tilda Swinton descending from above. This isn't the first time Swinton's bordered on the grotesque for Joon-Ho; everyone remembers her clicking, shivering Minister Mason, baring those misshapen teeth and just a dash of mania. You can spot a little of Mason in Lucy, robed and dusted in powdery white, trembling in excitement at Mirando's new breakthrough. This time her teeth are held in check by braces, but every now and again her words spill out from her mouth, and you can catch a glimpse of that unhinged capitalistic thirst behind it all. But Joon-Ho isn't just content with exposing the big corporations for their underlying menace (the big gag revealed at the end is that Lucy has an identical evil twin who supposedly represents the more ruthless side of her corporate identity, and who makes the cut-throat decisions in the aftermath of the disastrous pig launch), he's also throwing haymakers at the opposing side, in this case being the radical animal rights activist group ALF. Aside from having succinct, wannabe-cool nicknames (Silver, Red, Blonde) and matching haircuts, they're also lead by Paul Dano's Jay, who is the right actor for the role. Dano exudes a polite righteousness that shadows the more outrageous principles and actions that the group seek to pull off, and even when the film is throwing them under the bus for the sake of comedy and trying to make a broader point, he still shines. So, as they swear off food, trying to reduce their already minuscule carbon footprint, and tell their foes to 'buckle up' before slamming their truck across the lane (""We're not terrorists"", Jay proclaims), he maintains a thread of decency. Yet even Jay knows that some of the horrors that Okja seeks to reveal could be too graphic for poor Mija's eyes. He tells her ""Don't look back"", lest she turn and see the inhumane treatment of the mating ritual that Okja has been put through at the hands of Dr. Johnny Wilcox. Jake Gyllenhaal reinvents the word hammy in his eccentric portrayal of the celebrity zoologist, buckling under the pressure of the ten year spotlight. There are early signs of promise for his character; you can spot the cracking of his persona in his first interactions with the CGI Okja, the wonder in his eyes at the splendid super pig, tentative hands reaching out for trust. But Gyllenhaal seems to have no off switch, but launches into an aggressive, over-elaborate caricature, hurling wine bottles and whispering dark secrets. There may be a satirical point underneath it all on celebrity culture, social media masks and overexposure, but it gets lost in the noise. Wilcox laments that he must be 'on' at all times, but his 'off' is merely a louder, more obnoxious version of himself. If there is any scene that might turn viewers vegan it isn't the shaky, grainy, PETA-esque footage of Wilcox's abuse, but the penultimate confrontation at the super pig slaughterhouse, and the ensuing long walk past thousands of other specimens lined up towards the chute. The film achieves something striking and disturbing at this point; these are no longer fantasy creatures, but reminiscent of real animals being herded into metal machines to spit out our steaks and pork chops. Yet the overall sentiment of Okja is denial. Having gone through this whole ordeal, they are content to return to their idyllic mountaintop, with a cute little Okja in tow for an extra dash of adorable. Mija might have won the battle, but Mirando has ultimately won the war. And we are left scratching our heads at this warm feeling, even after all we have witnessed.",Okja

Welcome to a world where enormous pig creatures are bred and slaughtered for the purpose of solving world hunger. Bong Joon-Ho's intent here is a passionate plea for the humane treatment of animals and compassionate environmentalism. He ridicules the insincere and opportunistic corporatization of the green movement, in it's faux mission for humanitarianism. Most of his films speak of the moral perversion of unfettered capitalism. Here, I gather, this would be his most emotional piece yet on the topic. Okja is a cute and cuddly beast that can defecate live fish. Yeah, really. Okja is complete with a killer international cast, which includes Tilda Swinton as twin sisters of an agricultural empire and a hyper-manic Jake Gyllenhaal as a nature show TV personality.

45,RussHog,Good story from master filmmaker,8,5 July 2017,"We are what we eat - and in the case of the film Okja - apparently human are a bunch of fat pigs. That is the name of a super animal that is genetically created by a corporation to feed the future of the human population as resources dwindle. To make their product more viable - the company puts the animal on a Reality TV Show that will show how the best farmers across the world raise these animals to gain popularity for their product. The only problem is that one of the super pigs (cool movie creature too) has a little girl who raises it and they become friends. When the time comes for the super pig to be given up to society to be eaten - the girl goes on a mission to rescue the pig. What follows is a tale that has a lot of exposition and some strange performances - but the finale is super powerful and really stuck with me. The girl goes to a slaughterhouse and sees what happens to the super pigs, and it is really sad. If I was a child and I watched that scene I would probably cry and never eat meat again. Honestly - I feel bad that I ate meat today just watching this movie. A def must watch for fans of science fiction, hero quests, or just good stories.

46,MrDHWong,An interesting commentary on the way multi-million dollar corporations handle our food and their treatment of livestock in captivity,7,28 June 2017,"OKJA is a South Korean-American film starring Tilda Swinton, Paul Dano, Steven Yeun, and Jake Gyllenhaal. Directed by Bong Joon-ho (The Host and Snowpiercer), the film offers an interesting commentary on the way multi-million dollar corporations handle our food and their treatment of livestock in captivity.In the not-too-distant future, the Mirando Corporation, led by their greedy CEO Lucy Mirando (Tilda Swinton), assigns genetically enhanced giant pig-like creatures to specially chosen farms around the world. One such creature, named OKJA by their caretaker farmer in South Korea, shares a special bond with the caretaker's granddaughter Mija (Ahn Seo-hyun). After ten years under their guardianship, the caretaker and Mija realise that OKJA is to be taken away to America to be slaughtered and eaten by the buying public. Refusing to let this happen, Mija does whatever she can to save OKJA from this fate and bring her back home safely to the farm.Despite a predictable story and some questionable dialogue, OKJA still makes for a thought-provoking look into the world of GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) and animal rights. It certainly causes one think about where our food comes from and how it is processed for sale. The CGI for OKJA and the other pig-like creatures is quite convincing. Just looking into their realistic eyes makes one feel sad for the suffering they are going through. Tilda Swinton does a pretty good job portraying the face of a greedy, money-hungry organisation, even if she does come off as somewhat of a caricature. However, it is newcomer Ahn Seo-hyun as the caring Mija who steals the show. Her bond with OKJA feels just as genuine as it is in other child/creature bonding stories like E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial and My Neighbor Totoro.I rate it 7/10",Okja
47,Alexander_Blanchett,Great feel good film,8,1 August 2017,"Very beautiful film with a strong topic. Definitely not a kids movie, but with important topics that should be thought provoking for everybody. I am sure after this film a lot of people become vegetarians. I was close. ;-) The film really is able to touch the right spots with the audiences. Its a beautiful story about the friendship of a little girl and her (extraordinary) animal as well as a film about how greedy industrials can rape our nature. This mix up is wonderfully done by Joon- ho Bong. The acting was good. I was especially impressed by Bong's leading girl Seo-Hyun Ahn who was really capturing her characters brilliantly and I hardly ever saw a performer interact with so much feeling with an animated character. Excellent job. Jake Gyllenhaal was a bit too eccentric for my taste but he has one or two funny moments. Tilda Swinton was also fine in her double role but also a bit too exaggerated at some points but I guess that is just Bong's style. Paul Dano was really good. One of his better performances lately and it was nice to see Lily Collins. The film is a good follow up to ""Snowpierecer"" and a very original story with original characters and settings.",Okja

There are always oddities and quirks and even flaws, but there's also an artistic vision that's truly unique. Some of the moments and characters in Okja were WAY over the top, and there were about 5 different genres happening. But even so this story works. The quiet thoughtful moments are the real backbone here - not the visual effects or the imaginative plot twists. You care and you think every time Mija and Okja are on screen...which is something.

Perhaps a good idea, but a huge mistake in making it so damn cute... not to mention intelligent, compassionate and loyal. Also a mistake to have one raised by Mija in the Korean mountains where she bonds with the animal and cannot accept its fate as food. So when the heartless American company tries to reclaim its asset, Mija along with some new found friends take action. It's all a bit silly and has the air of a family friendly film filled with moral messages. However that's kiboshed by the sizeable expletive count and the obvious levels of manipulation on numerous levels from almost every character, be it the nasty business types or the right on activists. There's so much backstabbing and career drive on display it's like watching politicians on the nightly news. It's surprisingly dark and farcical. Gyllenhaal is deranged, Dano is ridiculous and Swinton is, actually she's rather good in a caricatured way. Animal cruelty, consumerism, maybe these things should be addressed in a family movie, but you'd probably have to cut down on the swearing!",Okja
50,ronakkotian,"A creative, satirical yet flawed film",7,25 February 2021,"Bong Joon-Ho has made great films throughout his filmography. His English language films may not be up to the mark of his Korean flicks but are still fascinating and creative.Okja is about Mija, a young girl from South Korea who takes care of her super pig named Okja. Ten years later, a large multinational company come back to take Okja away and use it for their own purposes leading Mija to try and rescue Okja.Bong Joon-Ho is a director I really like but Okja is one of his weaker ones. The film has a lot to say but I wish it handled its subject matter in a less manipulative manner. There are times, especially during the third act, where the message does come quite heavy-handed. Despite that, I was still entertained by Okja. The CGI used for the pig was pretty great for the most part. During a couple of moments it didn't look that great but for the most part I believed I was looking at aomething real. The way Okja interacts with objects near it also helped in the believability of the character. The film is well shot with moments where it really stood out such as a chase scene involving a truck. The production value as a whole is very good. The score was also fine. There was one song choice in a mall which didn't work for me but I didn't have any problem with the rest.The film goes for a satirical yet serious tone. Some of the characters are over the top and the acting does match that especially from Tilda Swinton and Jake Gyllenhaal. I thought Swinton maintained an acceptable amount of being over the top for her role which brought some laughs from me. However, I felt Jake Gyllenhaal went too overboard with the lunacy of his character. He is one of my favourite actors working today but he should have toned it down. Ahn Seo-hyun was great as Mija and her relationship with Okja was heartfelt and sweet. Paul Dano, Steven Yeun, Devon Bostick, Lily Collins and Daniel Henshall also give good performances here.Okja is an interesting and creative film that says a lot about the way we farm animals and GM foods but I wish there was more subtlety to its execution. The wild and satirical tone to the film and characters does create some hilarious moments. I did enjoy it overall but there were issues that prevented it from reaching its full potential.",Okja
51,andrewroy-04316,Okja skillfully manages both a heartwarming story of love's bond as well as an incisive attack on corporate animal meat production,8,5 April 2020,"Okja is a classic Bong mix of genres and characters through one symbolic constant: Okja. Okja is such a wonderful centerpiece for the film because she represents divergent ideas to each group. To Mija, she is her best friend; to ALF, she is a symbol for the fight for animal rights; and to Mirando, she is just one in a line of cold profit machines. Mija gets us invested in the movie early on - not being with Okja is simply not an option for her, and her unquestioning loyalty and pursuit of Okja is invigorating. There are some fun action scenes with Okja running wild with Mija as Mirando and ALF try to corral her. Where the movie really heats up is as ALF sees what is happening to Okja and tries to get her back. The juxtaposition of the caring souls of Mija and ALF with the coldhearted business people of Mirando is essential, though Bong maybe goes a bit too far in his caricature-like characterizations of them, particularly Lucy and Johnny Wilcox (Swinton and Gyllenhaal). Don't get me wrong - it's fun to see two phenomenal actors go in absurd directions with their characters, but they felt a little too detached from reality and that made the massive harm they're causing a bit incongruous. The scenes at the factory are as hard to watch as any brutal animal rights documentary, and twice as affecting because of the emotional attachment we develop to Okja. It's a happy ending, but behind it is the devastating fact that all of those other superpigs are still going to suffer brutally. Dano is fantastic as the main ALF guy, bringing a necessary seriousness to the group and their commitment to animal rights. Steven Yeun was also nice to see pop up. Like all of Bong's movies (I've only seen 3 so far but it'll grow, I can assure you) Okja has accessible relevant themes and blends genres seamlessly. Love the visual effects for the superpigs, and it's a funnier movie than I expected. Okja exceeded my expectations and will stick in my heart for the bond between Okja and Mija and in my mind for the critique on corporate food production. It's not that they're so mean and ruthless that business surpasses their emotions - it's that they truly don't care. They live in a business world where profits and PR make or break you, and animal cruelty simply isn't a part of the calculation.",Okja

The comparison between peaceful deep forest in Korea and busy, crowded, modern New York & Lucy and Nancy, & violence in meat factory and Animal Liberation Front. This movie does more than pungent revelation of meat industry's reality. Is the fact that mega-corporation's exploitation of resources can greatly damage peaceful lives of millions of Mija in deep forest justified? Can we trust the image of business as it is? The movie keeps giving us important questions to ask.I want to compare 'The Host' and 'Okja'. Director Bong's talent to infuse feelings to living objects other than human should be praised. Okja's interaction with Mija is phenomenal, and Okja (CGI or inanimate object) could have abundant amount of emotions because Ahn Seo-hyun (Mija) reacts remarkably. Both movies end with the same image: parenthood. In 'The Host', a protagonist becomes a father to a surviving child, 'Okja' becomes a mother figure to rescued super piglet.This movie is worth watching over again and again.

55,The_late_Buddy_Ryan,The 800 Pound Porker in the Boardroom,7,14 July 2017,"Bong Joon Ho's anti-GMO fable seems to have a lot going for it—a high-concept storyline; the title character, a hippo-sized CGI sow (whatever the porcine version of a heifer is); and some gorgeous mountain vistas. There's an amazing action sequence fairly early on, when Okja's on the lam and runs amok in an underground shopping mall (watch for the little girl with the pink cellphone who's trying to take a selfie). After that, things start to bog down—the good guys have some heavy issues to discuss; the baddies have lots of smirking, snarking and sneaking to get on with There are some striking images in the final scenes, set in a surprisingly tidy slaughterhouse in Paramus NJ, and Seo-Hyun Ahn, as Okja's BFF, and Paul Dano, as the ALF chief, turn in solid performances. Most of the Western actors are predictably typecast (Giancarlo Esposito, Shirley Henderson) or way over the top (talkin' 'bout you, Jake Gyllenhaal), and the satire is pretty broad (after a corporate lackey gets pelted with pig poop, somebody shouts out, ""He's having a shtty day!""). Boon seems to have subcontracted the Eng.-lang. dialogue to eccentric screenwriter Jon Ronson (""Frank""), who doesn't really hold his end up. A subplot with twin Tilda Swintons as the rival Big Food CEOs is especially uninvolving. Summing up—maybe best for anti-GMO crusaders and older kids whose parents don't mind their hearing the odd F- or S-word.

57,ebossert,"Bong's least impressive film to date, this is still moderately enjoyable",7,28 June 2017,"FYI, check me out as the Asian Movie Enthusiast on YouTube.Meet Mija, a young girl who risks everything to prevent a powerful, multi-national company from kidnapping her best friend - a massive animal named Okja.The lead actress here is Seo-hyun Ahn, who has had a small handful of supporting roles in prior films and series but never really stuck out to me personally. She's very good here; I liked her quite a bit because she portrays a determined, responsible girl who is also likable. Performances by Tilda Swinton and Jake Gyllenhaal, on the other hand, are extremely over-the-top. Swinton comes off well during the opening scene, but after that I got sick of her. She's not good in this. In a similar fashion, Gyllenhaal was almost bearable early on, but gets progressively unwatchable as the film rolls along. It's truly an atrocious performance with no nuance whatsoever. Not a big surprise given his acting history. I've never been a fan of this guy, and probably never will be.Thankfully, ""Okja"" exhibits some of the usual positives you get with Bong's films. You have a genre-bending experience, with lots of quirky, partially awkward humor that this director seems to be drawn to. This film also showcases some very nice natural environments early on, which is an added bonus. The score is mostly light and hard to explain. It's almost like something you'd hear at a circus, or maybe a polka dance. In any case, I enjoyed the music here. Special effects are also quite impressive for the big pig. One highlight is the lengthy chase/escape sequence that occurs during the first hour. Probably the most purely entertaining part of the film.So, what are some things that I did not like? Well, I already mentioned Swinton and Gyllenhaal's lackluster performance, but I also think that there are some pacing issues. ""Okja"" does begin with a 30-minute setup, which is actually quite interesting, then it throws us into that highlight thriller sequence – meaning that the opening hour of this movie is truly entertaining. However, the pacing definitely drags during the second half, or whenever Gyllenhaal is on screen. The excitement drops off a cliff, and that consequently exposes the shallow ""message"" of the film. And that brings me to my next point.One trend I've noticed in director Joon-ho Bong's last few films is that his messages are getting less nuanced but more heavy-handed. For example, I enjoyed ""Snowpiercer"" quite a bit, but one of the problems I had with it was that it was absurdly heavy-handed and cartoonish at times when hammering home its message. ""Okja"" suffers even more-so from the same problem because the antagonists are pure caricatures, and there's not as much pure entertainment value surrounding the message itself. You know, I really hope that this does not become a trend with this director.I would be a shame if Bong ends up like James Cameron – a man who is well on his way to wasting 25 years of his directing career making ""Avatar"" movies. Or he could end up like Michael Mann, another legendary director who fell off a cliff because he became obsessed with making digital film look great instead of creating interesting characters and stories. This kind of thing happens more often than you might think. Some directors get so obsessed with certain things that they develop a kind of tunnel vision that ignores all of the other important aspects of making a good film. You may think that this is an overreaction, especially considering how Bong still has yet to make a bad film, but I can see it coming if he doesn't right the ship. His next film is going to be important because if he keeps beating people over the head with increasingly blunt ""message"" films, it's gonna bite 'em in the rear-end because the ""message"" will end up superceding the filmmaking quality. And I can already see it beginning to happen with ""Okja."" With all of that said, ""Okja"" is a moderately entertaining affair, but there's no question in my mind that it Bong's least impressive film to date. If you have not seen a Joon-ho Bong film prior to Snowpiercer, I implore you to watch everything this man had made. His filmography is small too, so there's no excuse.",Okja

59,austin0731,What is an Okja?,8,2 July 2017,"I really enjoyed Okja coming from Korean director Joon-ho Bong who gave us other great films like Snowpiercer. Coming into it I had not much expectations of it, after watching the trailer and thinking that this seems like a very weird and quirky film but now that I have seen it it really reminds me of the greatness of snowpiercer. Both films were so great because it has these weird elements but within the chaos and madness there is a serious subject matter and a real statement that comes across. Okja delves into the dark side of the corporate livestock industry, this is something that we've all seen countless times on documentaries about the industry but Okja dramatizes it and takes the stakes to a whole new level by giving us a reason to sympathize with the characters and emotional impacts. I also liked that Okja also focuses on the group of animal activists and played with the idea of ethical considerations that not only these major corporations have to think about but is something that even the 'liberators' have to consider and go through. Indeed ethics was a major theme of Okja and how the modern corporate society only cares about the profitability over the ethic of choices and action. The film also explores the believability of marketing and advertisements, and makes consumers question our own choices and beliefs based on what we are told and fed by these marketing campaigns. I should also mention that the acting were pretty good across the board, from the lead, Seo Hyun to Tilda Swinton and also Paul Dano. However, Jake Gyllenhaal was rather odd. He plays an over the top zoologist and did a very high energy and high pitched performance which just seems a little over the top and takes away slightly from the film in my opinion. Also the cinematography was great, the parts that took place in Korea especially so and the way that they made Okja seem so effortlessly part of the real world and so realistic is just another major feat. Okja is definitely a film that tackles many side sand also a thought provoking one that is definitely worth watching.",Okja

A giant, lumbering beast resembling a hippo (though with a more baleful face), this creature is the future of cuisine, Lucy explains, and Okja is a prised calf sent to a farm in South Korea as part of a worldwide competition to find the best environment for her species. There she'll roam around the mountains for 10 years, munch on the grass, and becoming a loving companion to young Mija (Ahn Seo-Hyun), the farmer's granddaughter.The first act of Bong Joon-ho's wonderful film Okja, available Wednesday on Netflix (and screening in theatres in limited release), is delightfully bucolic. It follows Mija and her gargantuan pal as they shamble around, watched over by her well-meaning grandpa (Byun Hee-bong). Their untroubled existence feels a universe away from Lucy's Mirando Corporation, but the initial manicured, and slightly manic, press conference lingers in the mind. Mija's rural paradise seems too good to be true, a fantasy of an animal's upbringing exploited to make viewers feel less guilty about eating hot dogs. It's clear reality is going to encroach, and when it does, Bong knows how to make it hurt.The Korean Auteur is drawing more and more comparisons to Steven Spielberg, and it's not hard to see why—Okja is like a more brutal E.T., if E.T. had been at risk of being turned into mass-produced jerky. Like that film, Bong's is about the loss of innocence, but more importantly, it's about the value of innocence. Mija is neither a simpleton nor a fool for developing a genuine relationship with Okja, and she's right to try and rescue her when the Mirando Corporation eventually comes to take her away. You'll likely be gripping your armrest, practically cheering her on, as Mija gives pursuit to Okja's captors—though her enemy is a vast capitalist entity, her cause doesn't seem hopeless.The power of Bong's film is that it never lets go of Mija's purity of spirit, holding it up as a lesson many of us (particularly the meat-eaters) could stand to re-learn. Okja is, of course, a product— viewers know that about her before we even see her face. She's a stand-in for all kinds of factory farming, and of routine inhumanities that result from systems of mass production or global trade. But Mija's love for her isn't naive, or easily dismissed. Even the Mirando Corporation understands how valuable this affection can be—it's why Lucy is trying to introduce Okja as a real animal people can understand, so customers won't be afraid to fry her genetically enhanced flesh for breakfast.",Okja
62,carlos37andre,A fantasy to denounce the reality,8,2 July 2017,"Okja is a story full of metaphors that can at the same time be a fantasy in a way, and something real as well. The story and concept of this ""super pig"" is something we can easily imagine happening in the world we live in, where big corporations dominate almost everything.Even if you (like me) are not a staunch critic of capitalism, or even a vegetarian, you still can be touched by the story of the film. The plot is well tied, has a great construction of characters, and I think mainly, it deals with a subject that is little approached within the films, which is always something cool to see.Perhaps what most caught my attention in Okja are the acting, you have to look hard to find some actor that is bad there. Tilda Swinton is great as she had seen some people talk around. And Jack Gyllehaal deserves a special highlight, he's simply amazing! Steal the movie in every scene that appears, what a great actor!Obviously the film is not perfect, the CGI of the nut Okja, is in its vast majority of scenes does not seem real, always standing out more than the environment. So, do not get me wrong, the CGI is good, I understand that it is extremely difficult to do, especially when it has to be done in so long screen time, and with a budget not very large, but in basically all The day scenes, the CGI does not convince. Another thing that may bother in some moments is the tone of the film, in small parts of the film the same may seem a bit volatile too in its changes of tone, going from something colorful to super tense without much nexus.In short, Okja is a great movie, with incredible performances, an intriguing story full of metaphors that will probably make you rethink your life a bit in the end. The few defects within it do not spoil the experience.",Okja
63,ramisaakter,Shocking,6,21 May 2021,"I expected this movie to be a cute relationship movieb between a girl and a pig named Okja, kind of like anime type movie about their bonding, up and downs bla bla.

65,BigJimNoFool,Bloody Grandfather!,5,15 July 2020,If he'd only told the truth it could have been so different but then i suppose that's point. Its a darkly humorous original film taking large swipes are various subjects including commercial meat production and the activism that goes hand in hand with it and a satire on animal welfare celebrity. I felt too detached throughout to really connect with the characters emotionally and it does feel tonally imbalanced with acts of violence bad language set against the story of a child getting back her giant pig.,Okja
66,Morten_5,"Neither funny, nor engaging - and thus it falls flat",5,11 August 2017,"Watching ""Okja"", I couldn't help wondering whether the movie wants you to get angry or to laugh. I ended up not really caring at all.It's too exaggerated to be taken seriously and the writing is too clumsy to allow for laughs.In 2003, South Korean director Bong Joon-ho gave us the great thriller ""Memories of Murder"". Then came ""The Host"" (2006) and ""Snowpiercer"" (2013). With Netflix produced ""Okja"" (2017), however, Mr Bong seems to have lost some of that fingerspitzengefühl that was apparent in his previous works. What keeps ""Okja"" from falling apart completely is the fine chemistry between main character Mija (skillfully portrayed by South Korean actress Ahn Seo-hyun) and the nicely animated ""super pig"" Okja.",Okja
67,spencergrande6,Won't radically alter one's perspective but it is good fun,7,28 September 2017,"I really wanted this film to be more than a ""slaughterhouses are bad and animals are special movie"" but it adds nothing to any of the feelings or thoughts already expressed on the matter. Don't get me wrong, it's an important message and it's well presented here, but it's done in a mostly darkly cartoonish way that won't radically alter one's perspective. But it is good fun.The movie wants you to care about all the pigs but really it's just Okja that matters. Not to mention it seems to chicken out after it begins to give a conscience to the food factory. As great as saving beautiful animals is, the whole idea behind these pigs is to eliminate world hunger, so like, what does the movie have to say about that moral conundrum? Eh, not much. Okja cute and the girl is too (though she's so one-dimensionally obsessed with Okja she's hard to really care about).",Okja
68,OneAnjel,Two Very Realistic & Poignant Views,10,23 May 2021,"I was drawn to the film because of the creature reminding me of Falkor. I really loved this film. The loveable characters were so loveable and the despicable characters so despicable. If you're considering watching it, please know you will also have to read the first half of the film, unless you speak Korean. I normally don't keep watching when the producer fails to add the much needed voice-over, but with Okja the visual story was interesting enough to keep my interest. There's so much here, yet it might be preaching to the choir. I see reviews stating the film is dramatizing and shoving it down the throats of omnivores -- to which I reply: That was not a dramatization; that was the 'humane' method of slaughter that thousands of animals face each day. And btw, please watch The Game Changers (2018; Louie Psihoyos) which only addresses how vegan v omnivorous affects the human body regarding fitness & life-expectancy, & features every day people as well as world-renown athletes. Truly, the meat industry wants you to feel comfortable putting a slice of meat in your mouth that took thousands of gallons of water and acres of precious land to create. It's no longer only about whether we have compassion for animals, but whether we truly know what is happening to our planets' resources. But both ends of the spectrum are here: The extreme love & connection between Mija and the almost eerily intelligent Okja (a comment on how the true intelligence of animals is not understood); children are very connected to animals and there was a time that all humans felt that way; and the corporate giants who are enslaved by the mighty dollar who not only have suppressed their own morality but go to great lengths to suppress yours. Even the drunken mascot character was just a comment on how ridiculous the marketing looks to those who are better informed. This was definitely not for children; it was not a comedy, dark or otherwise. It was a sharp lens on what is happening in the world. Someone said it should be listed as sci-fi, but I disagree--this could actually happen. If I had any critique, it would be the CGI artists should also watch the animal in the wild (in this case, a hippo) for more realistic animation on the forceful movements of the character because otherwise the animation was absolutely realistic. I mean, we can all see where the parts of Okja were inspired -- the face and ears were a dog and monkey; the legs, feet & head were pig; the rest of him was hippo. In the wild, hippos don't move like Saturday morning cartoon characters when they are launching an attack or fall off a truck. Thanks for reading.",Okja
69,grumpy-3,most definitely overrated,5,1 July 2017,"the first half hour of this film is very good if a bit slow, once the pig is taken away and our little heroine goes after her it all goes downhill, it then turns into a pretty standard Disney/kids film, the difference is the really bad dialogue, everything is overstated many times, this is a cultural thing as it is the style of films from the east, subtlety is not their thing. the acting by Tilda Swinton and Jake Gyllenhall is so over the top, that and they have to spout really bad clichéd dialogue, i don't understand the rave reviews here and by the critics, it is not original in any way, it is far too long and drawn out, shame as it started out quite well.",Okja

71,ReganRebecca,A beautiful fairytale for adults,8,29 June 2017,"Okja is a sort of scifi fairytale, one that is explicit with its very simple messaging but is nevertheless beautiful and heart wrenching. Bong Joon-ho begins the film in 2007 when the CEO of a food corporation that is heavily invested with GMO's tries to revamp their corporate image by announcing a competition between 26 of their best super piglets. The super piglets are sent across the world to be raised by farmers and in ten years one lucky pig will win the title of Best Super Pig (and then apparently be consumed). Fast forward to 10 years later when a thirteen year old Mija, a country girl living in near isolation with her grandfather, is raising her super pig in the idyllic landscape where they play, forage for apples, and fish together. Things go awry however when she discovers that Okja (her pig) does not belong to her and will be carted off to America. From here on the movie turns into an adventure story as Mija must brave the world in order to be reunited with Okja. The film is wildly cartoonish in tone, but if you go along with it and let yourself be enchanted by this world you'll find yourself on a wonderful emotional journey. Some cheap CGI made me at first scoff at Okja, but as the movie goes on she seems more and more real till by the end I was near tears watching the film. Great performances by known and unknown actors alike. Just a great movie through and through.",Okja
72,barbagvido,"A bit confused, but a powerful message",8,21 November 2017,"Okja is a Netflix original movie about a Korean girl with this super-pig named Okja that she doesn't know is only kept alive for slaughter. When she does find that out, she will do anything to bring her friend back.The central message really is powerful and at times very well and brutally realistic brought to screen. It's just that sometimes it seems to get confused about what it's trying to say. Certain moments, at least. For example, one scene it shows that this one nice character could be another bad guy, but then it's just glossed over and the movie could have done very well without that, nothing would change. And it's a bit tonally confused as well. You've got a little bit of everything here. Sometimes it feels like a touching family film, sometimes like a deep and really serious (brutal, at times) allegory and sometimes it's just bonkers. It can get so over the top that it really gets annoying. Especially when it comes the characters. Maybe it was intentional, but even if it was, it fell flat because we have this really dark and serious scene that snaps us into reality, but in that same scene there is this really silly over-the-top characters that feels like he walked into a wrong movie, and it just doesn't fit well together.But aside from that, I found everything to work great. The story is moving, powerful and very metaphoric (and I love those when cleverly used in movies). The actors all did a fine job, some were extreme, but I guess that's what the director wanted from them. It also looks good, the pacing works and finally I didn't have the same problem that I had with a lot of Netflix original movies. The story finally felt complete. Even too much at times, but that's at least better than a wasted potential.Overall, even though it's a bit tonally confused, it's an emotional eye-opening roller coaster. Definitely worth a watch.",Okja

77,cappiethadog,G.M.T.,10,3 April 2020,"Nothing exciting ever happens in the suburbs. Southern California must be dreaming. The feds have landed. A whole block is cordoned off. A tract house, indistinguishable from the rest of the dross, is the locus. Mary(Dee Wallace) and her three children live there. Neighbors at the barricades mull over all this hullabaloo. ""Something is definitely happening,"" a boy on a bicycle observes. Astronauts walk on the wood flooring. And just like that, FBI men convert a kitchen into a field hospital. Not soon after, doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals arrive. When NASA sent the Apollo 11 Lunar Module to the moon, they had dreamt of finding little green men. No one expected to find intelligent life in the San Fernando Valley. It's day two of the occupation; the extra-terrestrial is hooked up to a ventilator, fading fast, despite the medical team's best efforts. ""I'm glad he met you first,"" ""Keys""(Peter Coyote), an unnamed fed, tells Elliott(Henry Thomas) as the life of this alien life-form hangs in the balance. He's right. Meet the wrong sort of people and Steven Spielberg's ""E.T.(The Extra-Terrrstrial) never materializes into a film about interplanetary love and friendship. That night, in the woods, when curiosity ends up stranding the extra-terrestrial, there is a car that pulls up. What if that car was filled with hunters, and not government men, who on foot, attempt to capture the intergalactic horticulturist, racing to his spaceship? Klaatu(Michael Rennie), famously, in Robert Wise's ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"", gets shot by a soldier who mistakes the visitor's cancer cure for a weapon. Civilians, especially survivalist-types, confronted by the unknown, would react even worse. Similarly armed, a hail of bullets discharged from seasoned deerstalkers with itchy trigger fingers could have stopped the spacecraft, killing e.t.'s galore and imprisoning the survivors. Suppose these hypothetical men live by the code ""eat what you kill"", men who are ideologically opposed to trophy hunting. What if E.T. was edible? What if the e.t.'s tasted like chicken. ""Keys"" knows what he's talking about, having met people from all walks of life, degenerates like Vincent Smith(Rory Calhoun), and his younger sister Ida(Nancy Parsons), who bury their intelligent livestock up to the neck in a ""secret garden"". They're not pigs, or a super-pig like Mija's Pet, in Bong Joon-Ho's ""Okja"". The sausages these farmers sell at their roadside stand are made out of people. ""Motel Hell"", Kevin Connor's 1980 cult classic, can be seen as a precursor to ""Okja"", since both films show how humanity has no proper place within a capitalist mode of production. Neither sibling has the wherewithal to ponder the immorality of ""harvesting"". Three human animals, hand-picked by Farmer Vincent, undergo processing for the slaughterhouse. Nothing personal; it's just business. Lucy Mirando(Tilda Swinton), CEO of the Mirando Corporation, is no different from these outback folks; it's just a matter of putting lipstick on a pig. The money they both rake in is drenched in blood.Michael(Robert Naughton) knows how to get under his younger brother's skin, suggesting that their atypical houseguest is just ""a worker bee who only knows how to push buttons or something,"" leaving Elliott aghast. Such is mankind's hubris, even at a tender age, this belief that we are the masters of the universe. Even Gertie(Drew Barrymore) underestimates and degrades Elliott's new friend. ""Is he a pig? He sure eats like one,"" the little girl quips, asserting her privilege of being a primate blessed with opposable thumbs, completely oblivious to the fact that hogs are intelligent in their own right, the equal of dogs. A pig can't save your life, but a super-pig can. When the animal's master slides down a mountain cliff, Okja has the presence of mind to stomp on the rope, keeping the dangling girl suspended over treetops a long-way down. The super-pig notices a dead stump jutting out from the rocks, then calculates that by running parallel alongside the cliff, he can entangle the rope and deliver Mija(An Sri-Hyun) safely onto the mountain's surface while sacrificing his body to gravity. Smarter, for sure, than the aspiring sheepdog in Chris Noonan's ""Babe"", but alas, even a super-pig with opposable thumbs. ""He, too, is smart,"" Elliott responds in kind, and soon E.T. proves the boy's instincts right. Like any pioneer who studies a methodical part of the material world, the alien turns science fiction into science fact, influenced by extrapolative minds from yesteryear, when he reconfigured a Speak and Spell, the popular children's toy, into a communicator, after reading an old ""Buck Rodgers"" comic strip. E.T. can phone home. E.T. is an intelligent creature with the ability to give and receive love. To regard the soft-hearted visitor with an inquisitive mind as a specialty meat is unthinkable, given the close bond he forged with Elliott. It's a hug for the ages, when boy and alien say their final goodbyes. Interestingly, when Michael pats E.T.'s slimy head, the creature recoils, lowering his adjustable neck, intuiting, perhaps, that tiny bit of latent malevolence throughout his dislocating residence. ""I just hope we don't end up on Mars or something surrounded by millions of little squishy guys,"" he tells Elliott, which an audience contemporaneous to its original theatrical release, surely, let slide by as an off-color joke. In hindsight, construing Michael as a threat to E.T.'s safety had his younger brother not assert ""absolute power"" over the ""man from the moon"" is worth pondering over. Remember pizza night? Who grabs the sharp knife from the dishrack? While gathering food from the refrigerator, Michael sings a few lines of Elvis Costello's ""Accidents Will Happen"", the opening track from ""Armed Forces"", an allusion, arguably, to the army soldier who makes an attempt on Klaatu's life in ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"". The FBI man was so on-point in his praise of the boy. Gertie, too, comes out of this a better person. The young girl would never dream of kissing a pig, let alone a gross alien, but she gives E.T. a light peck on its nose. ""Okja"", in my opinion, reimagines ""E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial"", using Gertie, or rather, a female, as the protagonist. Many film theorists have pointed out that the alien's gender is indeterminate; it's just a matter of projection, tilted by sexual bias. Bereft of any empirical proof, Elliott decides that E.T. is a boy, whereas Gertie dresses the alien up to resemble a grandmother on holiday. Bong Joon-Ho, knowingly, sets the record straight from the get-go. Okja is a girl. Johnny Wilcox(Jake Gyllenhaal), a zoologist for the Mirando Corporation, checks the super-pig's undercarriage, once he regains his breath after a tiresome climb up the mountains of Seoul. It, or rather, she, has a mammary gland that the television personality proclaims to be ""impressive"". Okja, despite being the intellectual equal of a border collie, is destined for the slaughterhouse.""Come on, don't you want to be free?"" Amber(Ashley Johnson), a food industry worker bee-turned-animal activist, asks a cow that she and her college friends fail to liberate in Richard Linklater's ""Fast Food Nation"". Born in captivity, Amber's cow remains in her overcrowded pen, lacking the cognizance to flee. Incarceration is all she knows. This cow disappoints Amber, but the spilt milk that comes from her udder is nothing worth crying over. All cows look alike. In ""E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial"", milk, literally, gets spilled, when Elliott drops the carton, an acute dovetailing reaction to the alien's fear of umbrellas from upstairs. What Bong Joon-Ho does is endow livestock with a non-anthropomorphic personality. She's not a babe; she acts like a real pig. Nothing gets lost in translation, the language from her eyes. Okja knows where home is. It's a place you can't find on the map. Okja's home sits in the backseat of a company car, insisting that the driver put her through to the G.M.T.(genetically-modified terrrstrial). Like an octopus or cow, smart non-primates both, Okja lacks an opposable thumb, therefore unable to call ""home"", but when Jennifer(Shirley Henderson), Lucy Mirando's assistant, gives the zoologist sell-out a ring in the multi-national food company's secret laboratory, voice recognition galvanizes the traumatized pig, convalescing after a bout of forced animal husbandry, to live. Live to die, though, Okja realizes, running circles in the marveling room, as a focus group of taste-testers wait to sample the ham. Does Okja dream? A sow's dream, conceivably, could approximate the final scene in ""Motel Hell"", when Farmer Vincent, donning a hollowed-out pig's head as a mask, fights the law, Sheriff Bruce(Paul Linke), his brother, with chainsaws. As the super-pig walks up a ramp to the pneumatic drill box, G.M.T. waits for boys on bicycles to fly her away; she waits for Jay(Paul Dano), leader of the Animal Liberation Front, a friend with more friends, but most of all, she waits for Mija, the one who loves Okja best. Ahead of her, she hears the discharge of a captive bolt gun.Mija stops the vivisection. Neither the man operating the machinery, nor Nancy Mirando, Lucy's twin sister, cares that the super-pig was lucky to have met Mija first. The man in a white lab coat lets Mija go because his boss got paid.E.T. is not meat.Arguably, nothing is.",Okja

The only things I found to enjoy about this film were the cinematography, performances and visual effects, all of which were pretty decent, but apart from that this film was boring and a massive let down after watching Parasite, too dark for children but too stupid for adults I'm left very unsure of who this film was aimed at.

Its about a Super Pig discovered by an Agro Company who gave her to a Korean Farmer to be raised and be taken 10 years later to display her like a model for the super pigs who will solve the hunger problem in the world. And then there is a vigilant activist group who want to expose the company for their propoganda and cruelty. And in the middle there is Mija & Okja who just want to live together like they have always lived. The Cinematography is incredible, the fight scenes are well made, the characters are very unique & often hilarious. Jake Gylenhall is amazing in his most bonkers role yet.

83,HanShotFirstGR,Great social criticism with some obvious faults!,7,7 February 2021,"Plot:A young girl risks everything to prevent a powerful, multinational company from kidnapping her best friend - a fascinating beast named Okja.Analysis:After Bong Joon Ho dominated in Academy Awards with his masterpiece ""Parasite"", his previous works became more well known in western audience. Okja was one of those films, it contains a pretty intetesting cast and a decent budget to invest in visuals. This film has the same amount of social criticism as most of Bong Joon Ho's movies, it deals with many modern problems like animal abuse, harmful marketing techniques and of course capitalism. Many things were done perfectly and there were moments this was a mindblowing experience but it was held back due to bad choices and some weird ideas.The humor doesn't work at all, there are some few cases that were kinda funny but for the most part the jokes were weird and the attempt to have funny idiosyncrasies of characters was a big failure. There are good elements in this film but it's not really funny and sometimes their effort to make this film more lighthearted leads to cringey results. It would be much more entertaining to keep it a social drama than trying to do something that is clearly not your style and comedy isn't that easy to be done correctly.Tilda Swinton, Paul Dano, Jake Gyllenhall and Giancarlo Esposito were a few names that worked with Bong to produce this film and they did a great job. A great cast is an important step towards greatness and this movie had a very good one, all of them are talented and successful actors who take their jobs pretty seriously and they aim for the best result possible. It's a perfectly acted film that shows professionalism and great talent, especially from Paul Dano and Tilda Swinton who stole the show. Also, the young Seo Hyun Ahn was pretty good, she was a major factor of this film's success with her emotional reactions and very natural behaviour to portray a little farmer girl who is willing to go against a multinational company to save her friend.The plot had many important things to say and for the most part it was pretty interesting to watch but there were also a few minor faults that had a negative effect on the quality of this movie. The overall message is very important, capitalism is a harmful system that gives people power to take what they want by stepping on others and destroying lives, this is nicely portrayed in Okja without having something extraordinary as an example, but something close to the viewer that will have a bigger impact. The ending -which is the best part of the whole movie- is the most realistic and impactful example of how capitalism works, how money and profit is all that these people care about and the way this story ended isn't just a proof of that but also feels justified and works from movie perspective.The visuals are gorgeous, from the green forests where Okja grew up to the beautiful special effects and the cold colors that were used in most of the scenes, it's an eye-candy movie, something that will not just impress you but it will also highlight the impact of the story. Every Bong Joon Ho's film is absolutely stunning visually, his way of capturing emotions and situations, his use of great cinematography and his unique ideas of how to portray some events visually are factors that led these movies to success and Okja is another stunning-to-look-at film.The main reason this film doesn't reach its full potential except the failed attempt to be funny is the ""villain"". From Mija's point of view this would be a very good film about social injustice but having the opportunity to watch it from both sides was a bad idea. Tilda Swinton was amazing without any doubt, but her character was unessecary and didn't have an intetesting arc, every scene that tries to show her life and journey is just boring and feels like a filler, they should have kept it less personal and focus on Okja's story instead of trying to give everyone bigger motives.Conclusion:It's definetely a very different film and it's a worthy one to spend 2 hours to experience it, it has many amazing stuff to see and analyze and despite the problems the overall feeling is strongly positive. It's a unique idea with a just good enough execution, it does a good job to inform people about society's serious problems without being boring or too complicated. A pretty good film and a nice experience to make you think more and care more.Rating: 7.5/10",Okja
84,benxrichardson,Wildly original,8,10 September 2020,Okja is gripping from beginning to end and is beautifully shot. The film can be confronting and has a powerful message which will keep you thinking.I really enjoyed Okja. 10 stars for originality.,Okja
85,whatdoes1know,Free the GMO,8,14 February 2021,"For the longest time, I've avoided this movie with a stick picturing a Free Willy Disney flick. However an automated preview abounding with Snowpiercer-like eccentricity made me rethink venturing into it. Marketing this movie to kids is a sure plan for failure with the violent action and cruelty towards animals. The realistic creature design like in The Host, might leave something to be desired, but doesn't really get in the way of the movie. Seeing Glen from the Walking Dead kicking around is also an added bonus.",Okja
86,seige-hound,A well made parable for the ethical treatment of animals,9,1 July 2017,"The best thing about this film is that it approaches the subject matter very well. While some can argue it's a little heavy-handed, I personally think it approaches the subject with a lot of nuances. This film isn't at all saying anything like 'Veganism is the only ethical way to live', not at all. In fact, the main character and her grandfather are deliberately shown to be catching fish and keeping chickens to eat.Rather, this film is a condemnation of the way the meat industry has devolved into this awful hellscape. Near the end of the film, we are shown the truth about the Super Pig program and are shown an awful sight of electric fences keeping these large animals together in crowded and cramped spaces across acres of land. As meat eaters, this is something that we're used to. We know that chickens, pigs and cattle are often kept in cramped spaces where all they can do is sit and eat until they die, but we distance ourselves from this idea, because meat tastes good, and it's convenient, and I don't necessarily think this film will convince everyone to become vegan (it will convince some, but not everyone), but what Okja does, that makes it such an effective parable, is that it lets us relate to Okja, see how smart of an animal she is. The film gives her a personality and a relationship, and we get to see how Mija and Okja relate to each other, that it's not just a master/owner relationship, but a genuine inter-species friendship. We see this relationship before we are shown the fields of animals, all like Okja, that are kept in these awful conditions.So we end up asking 'Where is our meat coming from, and if I find out, am I willing to accept that?' I think this is a question worth answering for ourselves.As for veganism, the film doesn't give them much slack either. The side characters from the Animal Liberation Front are very interesting, and the film gives those characters a surprising amount of moral ambiguity, where the crew are willing to bend their own code of ethics to serve a 'greater good', an action that does backfire for them in the end.There is one particular joke in the film that gives a bit of evidence that the film isn't entirely 'pro-vegan'. One of the ALF members, when we first meet him, is fainting from hunger because he refuses to eat anything, including vegetables, because all food is sourced from exploitation, or something along those lines. The same character is later shown being offered a piece of Super Pig Jerkey, and takes a bite.So in conclusion, this film is entirely worth watching wherever you can. It is a hard watch at times, but I think it's a film that will go down as one of Netflix's best original offerings.",Okja
87,ianwagnerwatches,Fascinating,8,28 September 2019,"I can't find any more fitting word to describe this experience than ""fascinating"". This film incorporates a variety of different story elements very effectively, making the genre hard to place. There's action, stunning cgi and vfx, great drama, impressive and standout character work from Tilda Swinton, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Paul Dano, a wide variety of unique environments/locales, a strange sense of humor, and it's all totally cohesive, unlike this sentence. The elaborate storytelling makes for a truly gripping viewing experience, and I walked away from it with new ideas and feelings. This film feels like a true epic, and I highly recommend it to anybody who's ever enjoyed a movie. I especially recommend this film to people who love animals, and I can almost guarantee that it will bring you to tears..",Okja

89,dissident320,A little worse than expected,7,29 June 2017,"I came in with a little bit higher expectations than I perhaps should have. I quite enjoyed his previous movie Snowpiercer and this seemed to have an equally interesting premise that could make for a strong story. Seo-Hyun Ahn who plays Mija, a young girl who grew up with Okja puts in extremely strong performance. Without her in this role I don't think this movie would work at all. Some of the bigger names don't fare as well. Tilda Swinton in an unnecessary dual role is neither evil enough to hate nor interesting enough to pay attention to. She's played more interesting characters in worse movies (Trainwreck) and she doesn't do anything of note in this one. But let's talk about Jake Gyllenhaal. For better or worse he is going for it. I wasn't bothered by his performance (nor was I enamoured) but I never really understood the point of his character. He doesn't have an arc and if you remove him from the movie it doesn't alter a thing. If anything, taking out his scenes might even the tone out a bit. The other characters that have a bit more screen time are Paul Dano and Steven Yeun. They're both put in solid albeit unremarkable performances. Without spoiling anything the movie has a strong beginning, slow to poor middle but a very powerful ending (There is an after credits scene!). My last nitpick is CGI Okja. While I welcome movies pushing the envelope in regards to creating completely computer generated animals/monsters/humans/etc I don't think they quite pulled it off. The opening scenes in Korea probably look the best but I never felt like Okja was completely real. When people interacted with her something always looked a bit off to me. And for a such a large animal it never seemed to be very heavy, especially when moving around. Still definitely worth seeing and one of the better movies of 2017 so far.",Okja
90,stroggos,This one is an allrounder! Satisfies at many levels; not a kids movie though!,7,24 August 2017,"OKJA is an American/Korean co-production with an all star cast, including Jake Gyllenhall, Tilda Swinton and Paul Dano. The story follows a young Korean girl who grows up in the mountains, with the ""super pig"" Okja as her companion. But the evil Miranda corporation, led by Tilda Swinton's eccentric character, wants to reclaim the pig. In trying to rescue her porcine friend from its fate, our young protagonist gets caught up in war between corporate greed and a group of animal rights activists.OKJA is an allrounder—it satisfies at many levels, and it will satisfy many different kinds of moviegoers. The film is suspenseful, fast-paced, visually pleasing, and at times funny. OKJA is also quite thought-provoking, asking some deep questions about animal rights and the limits of technology.Perhaps surprisingly, OKJA reminded me quite a lot of THE DARK KNIGHT. There's quite a few scenes that are strikingly similar, such as a car chase scene with a truck in an underground tunnel, as well as a parade between sky scrapers... but besides these superficial similarities, there's also a fascinating and eccentric villain, moral themes, and even a Joker-esque character!All in all, I can highly recommend OKJA. However, while the movie definitely qualifies as a crowdpleaser, beware that it definitely isn't a kids movie. OKJA has some gut-wrenching animal cruelty and can be, at times, quite violent. This is an epic movie for adults that disguises as a kid's story about a young girl loving her animal friend.",Okja

Sometimes playing for laughs with its satire and boasting signs of originality throughout its duration; whilst handing down the weightier scenes on a cliche splattered platter with the usual stereotypes.But an over-the-top performance in Jake Gyllenhaal was a treat and one of the highlights of the movie for me. I've seen enough of him in quiet, serious, nuanced roles that it's a delight when he comes out with a full facial performance that is a far cry from his usual body of work - with the exception of Nightcrawler.

97,CinePendejo,"A footnote to a great resume, but a heck of a big one!",8,1 July 2017,"You kinda have to wonder what goes on in the mindset of director Bong Joon-Ho. As expressed in his films, he always finds a winning formula of combining both serious, contemplative dramas with over-the-top Abbot & Costello-esque slapstick without conflicting our investment. Seriously, go watch MEMOIRS OF MURDER & THE HOST again; it all looks like tonal clusterf***s, but it never breaks immersion. It's like his ultimate thesis is that both comedy and drama come hand in hand, where we live our lives in two reactive extremes all while embracing the ride without questioning it. His newest film, OKJA, is no different.Blending the lyrical, moody fantasy kids films like MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO with over-the- top corporate satire straight out of a PETA propaganda, OKJA might be his extreme example of said thesis yet. It's a movie that's both emotionally resonant, hilarious, and at times both at the same time. It may be a few beats short of a classic like his other films, but is a hell of a testament of his talent.This time around, he once again takes jabs at social satire much like the magnum opus SNOWPIERCER, but against the corporate cynicism of Monsanto food companies instead of class warfare. Seo-Hyun Ahh plays Mija, a girl who raised a GMO super pig names Okja in the mountaintops of South Korea with her grandpa. Sadly, Okja is subjected to be the next state-of-the-art alternative of packaged meat property of Mirando Corp. (get it?!) and Okja has to be taken away. As true to what is probably Bongs most spirited girl character ever conceived, Mija takes it upon yourself to rescue her, traveling through buildings, running through traffic, and ultimately teaming up with a team of revolutionaries (led by Paul Dano) to rescue her from slaughter. For a movie that seems so painfully predictable on the spectrum of ""SAVE NATURE"" movie genre, there's surprisingly a lot to unpack here. For example, Mija just wants to save her big piggly friend, not overall stop the corporate machine. The revolutionaries have a well-intentioned motive but go through very slimy and demented options to get there. Heck, even though Mirando is doing a lot of evil to our adorable superpigs, they're never seen as evil to others; they're just too busy wondering why this super meat taste so good! Sure it takes obvious jabs at the meat industry (even as far as to make Okja a literal species straight from a LAB!) but Bong is too smart to fall under cheap trappings. His ultimate saying actually, is that no matter how much damage capitalist economy does to nature in general, it'll probably never be stopped. But all that matters isn't ""who's gonna stop it?"" Or ""save our animals"" but rather to preserve the love of two odd friendship between a girl and her big piggie. It's like the critic Greg Vellante says ""Love wins the battle, Greed wins the war"". When does that ever been a messages to these films, especially if a film has what is essentially a mix between a dinosaur and Eyeore from Winnie the Pooh.That aside though, the rest of the movie wouldn't work had it not been for the rest of the film. The film once again shifts from audacious comedy and lyrical drama each second at a time, constructing a weird univserse that you can't help but both cry and laugh at the same time. The films first act dedicates Okja and Mija playing together in a forest and having fun. It's a quieter, more meditative sequence in the whole picture that achieves in making us easily care for these weird characters. By contrast, the 2nd act involves a car chase/ strip mall sequence so over-the-top it feels straight out of BLUES BROTHERS. The 3rd act comes close to being the most gruesome and depressing scene Bong could allow, yet still ends in a much more hopeful and tear-inducing capper. Say what you will about tonal shifts and consistency, this guy breaks all the rules.All the actors in this movie are great (except Jyllenhaal, who looks like he came from 5-8 different movies) but Okja herself is the main star. It's not the most impressive CGI, but Bong photographs her with appropriate scale and prescience in every scene. The result looks incredible, the type of achievement that shows how we can use computers to great effect. Seo-Hyun is also amazing, and Tilda Swindon offers yet another fantastic character of American authority figure.Overall, this might be Bong Joon-Hos footnote to quite an impressive resume, but I'll be shocked if it isn't a heck of a great one. It's available on Netflix after the whole Cannes debacle. Highly recommended, even if you do need a big TV at home for it.",Okja

100,GODZILLA_Alpha_Predator,A tale of animal friendship and corporate horror,8,1 July 2017,"Okja is a story about two innocent souls struggling to stay together in a corrupt world. The opening quickly shows its capitalistic and self- branding nature with newly appointed CEO Lucy Mirando (Swinton) giving a big, loud bragging speech with a flashy slideshow about being eco-friendly while ironically taking in place in a big dirty, abandoned chemical factory that was run by her publicly-hated family. Move forward to 10 years, it then switches to the quite, and peaceful Korean mountains that is in stark contrast from the artificial, loud and noisy corporate America that we just saw. There we meet 13-year old Mija (Ahn-Seon Hyun) and her adopted family member, Mirando's genetically modified super pig Okja. There you fall in love with the relationship that is established between these two but heartbreak ensues once Mirando's employees reclaim Okja as company property. There it becomes a series of events set forth by Mija's determination to rescue Okja from the fate of being slaughtered to feed an overpopulated, starving and consumer-filled world.Having seen two of his previous films, The Host and Snowpiercer, Bong Joon-Ho I believe is one of the best directors working today. His style and sensibility is so different from most directors you see working in Hollywood today. If you have never seen his films, be prepared as Okja is a collection of multiple tones from being satirically funny, dark and bleak, thrilling to emotional. His fun, comedic beats are used lure you as the audience into something more shocking and dark while still being anchored emotionally to the bond between Mija and Okja. Bong is never afraid to tackle subject matter that most studios won't approach hence why Netflix was the most appropriate outlet to produce and distribute this odd but unique project of his. Here Bong takes a stab at the greed and lack of compassion in capitalism and society's obsession with social media promotion. Bong shows Mija and Okja as victims of a corporate cause that simply uses them as promotional props to look honest and humane but will eventually abuse, mistreat and discard them to satisfy a customer. The film constantly has a running gag of saying that Okja was made to be food and how tasty she will be. But once Bong takes you to the slaughterhouse in the final act, you realize he has been building towards to the reveal of the true horror of what really happens to animals that are bred to be your food. While the resolution isn't a big and epic set piece, he knows that is an easy way out which most Hollywood blockbusters would take. He shows that we live in a world where reasoning with those that embody capitalism can't be bought with empathy or compassion. And maybe the only way to win is to appeal to their basic greedy nature. Like his previous films, the ending may seem bleak and dark but he injects small glimmers of hope for you to still have just enough faith in humanity.Along with the writer of Frank (2014) Jon Ronson, Bong has written a gallery of unique characters that embody the film's rich story. Ahn- Seon Hyun as Mija is a standout among her English-speaking costars. Mija is a brave and confident protagonist who will risk life and limb to save Okja and not let the language barrier nor corporate workers hold her back. Ahn-Seon does not rely on much dialogue in general to give a strong and emotional performance. Her second role in one of the Bong's films, Tilda Swinton gives her character Lucy Mirando a fair amount of desperation, sadness and image-obsession to make her feel not pure evil. Lucy is never motivated by wealth unlike her sister but is driven by the need for the world to give her the love and attention that her family never gave her. However she channels her blame on others to avoid seeing how flawed she is on the inside. While I wish there was more of the other Mirando sister Nancy (also played by Swinton), we do get to see how cruel and inhumane she can be when driven by power and wealth. The ALF (Animal Front Liberation) members played by memorably by Paul Dano and Steven Yeun contrast the Mirando sisters's harsh ways. They believe so strongly in the fairness of all creatures that they avoid inflicting as little physical violence as possible in their operations. However, that doesn't stop their own actions from having unforeseen consequences on Okja and Mija. If there is one weak link in this gallery of colourful characters, it is Jake Gyllenhaal. Normally great in other movies, his over-the-top portrayal as Dr. Johnny Wilcox, a washed-up animal show host gets really close to Jar Jar Binks-ing the movie with his shrieking, nagging voice.What makes you fall in love with this movie is the titled animal herself. Created with stunning vfx and animatronics, Okja is a creature that carries the lumbering qualities of a hippo with the sad face of a manatee but has the loving personality of your favourite pet dog. Okja displays a cute, intelligent but yet clumsy personality with scenes between her and the human characters looking so seamless and real. And it hurts when you see this poor soul go through hell throughout the course of the movie. Everyone one of Okja's tears you see is our heart breaking inside.Okja is odd and unorthodox and so it needs to be. We now live in a time where we take the natural world for granted and just become obsessed with consuming but not giving back. Through all of madness that goes on is this film Bong Joon-Ho makes us see the madness that exists in our own corrupted world. Okja may not be for everyone but it is a movie that you will be affected in more ways then you were expecting.",Okja
101,paulmcuomo,"An original, heartfelt drama that avoids patronising",9,12 July 2017,"You'll be relieved to hear - like I was to find out - that this movie isn't about to pound a ideology, in this instance Vegetarianism specifically down your throat, but it's about something far more accessible: this is case a young girl and her best friend, which happens to be a giant GM pig called Okja.The film is by Boon Joon-hu, the director behind the Dystopian Sci-Fi film Snowpiercer, and is a film that stars a Korean cast headed by Ahn Seo-hyun and also Hollywood actors such as Tilda Swinton, Giancarlo Espositio, Paul Dano, Lily Collins, Steven Yeun and a crazy as hell Jake Gyllenhaal.Like said, the plot of the movie is very simple from the outset - a company run by Tilda Swinton's Lucy Mirando has found 26 pigs that can grow to a large size, and that in 10 years, they will pick the best pig to be the face of the company, but all will be slaughtered for food. 10 years later, the pig owned by Heebong and his granddaughter Mija (Seo-hyun)is taken, and this granddaughter tries to get her back, whilst being drawn into the workings of a Animal-Rights Group, led by Jay (Paul Dano) and also into the hostile takeover of Lucy Mirnado's company by her twin, also played by Swinton.Much like Snowpiercer, the film has a very solid handle of both action and cinematography, with a great look that is very full of colour, or lack of in certain moments of horror like the slaughterhouse scene near the end, or the torture scene which features an amazing performance by Jake Gyllenhaal as the focus. Pretty much the whole movie is fantastically directed, because unlike Snowpiercer where the environment was artificial, this in in real places and time, and the fact that you can get a clear, accurate distinction between locations is a credit to the filmmaker that I hope does get more work to be seen in the West - we didn't get Snowpiercer on DVD or in Cinema over in the UK for example - and even so, I hope he gets more work with Netflix.The best part of this movie by a mile is the acting. This is, outside of Baby Driver, the best ensemble cast that I've been pleasured to see this year. The child actress who is the lead of the film, Ahn Seo-hyun, is fantastic as the lead in this film. She never feels fake, or like a kid acting - she feels legitimately like a kid, who has lost her only friend and wants her back. And I also really impressed by her physicality in the role, as there's a very large amount of running and intense action that was really exciting to watch with how she sold it, and became both the emotional backbone of the film, with an ability to compliment the action.The other Korean cast members, Byun Hee-bong and Yoon Je-moon as Mija's grandfather and a Mirando executive respectively, are solid and keep the film moving.The real standouts among the English cast are Paul Dano, Tilda Swinton and the aforementioned Jake Gyllenhaal. Paul Dano in particular is really satisfying to watch, when you consider how much he has truly grown up as an actor since Little Miss Sunshine, as he plays the leader of the AFL who fight for Animal Rights, and is a organised, disciplined leader that you can see why people follow, but is also incredibly brutal against those who go against him as in one already brutal scene that he elevates further. Tilda Swinton appears in a joint role as Lucy Mirando and Nancy Mirando, both of whom are very different and you can see elements of her previous performances in Michael Clayton and The Chronicles of Narnia; Lucy is very much a person who is neutral in nature, and is very much on the urge of breaking, whereas Nancy, who is the truly evil one of the pair, is a total monster and lacks the grey elements that her sister has, and this distinction is clear and obvious. Jake Gyllenhaal is, in this movie, totally insane - in the best way! As the zoologist who works for Lucy in the GM project, he is incredibly unpredictable and grows so much more sadistic as the film goes on. It's hard to imagine an actor like Gyllenhaal would take this part when you consider how stock it sounds on paper, but he uses his immense skill to make Johnny Wilcox into a character you go from laughing at to being repulsed and scared by, especially during the films ""forced-mating"" scene in which he both repulsive and monstrous too.In terms of pacing, the film is very solid. It moves about very rapidly and doesn't overstay its welcome. The ending is tad too bittersweet for me, although the post-credits (yes, there is a POST-CREDIT SCENE) does give a bit of hope. In short though, I really rate this movie highly, despite a slightly bitter ending and some odd music cues. This is a must-see. So go see it!",Okja
102,adam-may-bower,Impactful,7,2 June 2018,"'Okja' is a bizarre film that leaves it's intended impact on the audience. Essentially, I was excited to see this film for it's cast. Containing my two favourite actors, Tilda Swinton and Jake Gyllenhaal, as well as having Steven Yeun and Lily Collins, I knew the acting in 'Okja' would be nothing short of amazing. While Swinton stole every scene she was in, the lead performance from thirteen year-old Seo-Hyeon Ahn was the real stand-out performance and is the reason the movie has so much heart and soul. The plot of the film, written by director Bong Joon-ho, is highly original and disturbing, and it is clear what Joon-ho wants his audience to feel. You would not want to be eating meat while watching this movie, and even afterwards. Upon first glance, 'Okja' may appear to be preachy and persuasive, but it really is just blatant and disturbing commentary on corporate greed and the naive consumerism of our society. Joon-ho approaches this in a very weird manner, with odd characters and random moments of humour that don't match up with it's overall dark and heavy themes. While this may repulse mainstream audiences, Okja manages to shine through it's important message and brilliant acting.",Okja
103,Alex_Kladis,Quick Review,5,28 September 2018,"Okja is an amazingly good-looking movie with a pretty straight forward message about capitalism, nature and animal cruelty, but there is a great ""BUT"" that made me not to enjoy the Film.Okja adapts a very Black-n-White view on its subjects making everything that it disagrees with terrible and hilarious and everything that it's pro about pretty peaceful and good. And that made the Picture so one-sided that even I (someone who mostly agrees with the message) found myself disliking it.Overall, I cannot say that i do not recommend it. For sure, it's a film that requires your reaction to it, but I believe that for most of the viewers, it would be a great film or a horrible one.",Okja
104,dungeonstudio,Overtly Obese,8,16 July 2017,"With previous Bong Joon Ho movies, there was humble and sinister subtexts which I really admired. With his take on Snowpierecer though, it was more up front, and direct in what makes humans want to survive and at what cost. Okja again I'd say is personally heartfelt by Bong Joon Ho, but seems to be getting pulled in many directions at once. He's a internationally credible and respected film maker now. Attractive to, and attracting many A List actors. And thanks to The Host, is expected now to deliver some great special effects. And to me, that IS NOT what Bong Joon Ho is about! And Okja seems to teeter on that so dangerously close to falling either way. Much of Bong's great eye for scenery and framing flourishes in this film, along with his amazing empathy with young characters. And too, his daring personal stance on the likes of Monsanto and GMO corporations that they maybe more evil than good for our future sustainability and psyche. But there seems to be an external force weighing in on Okja now as well. Do away with character backgrounds. Make the funny moments funny, and the emotional moments emotional. Utilize the 'star power', and trivialize his heritage. And of course the crippling studio ethos now of 'If we give you a little to make this movie, can you give us a lot in return?' I think Bong mediated well on both sides to get Okja done. And it's enjoyably disturbing. But is uncomfortably close to a Disney film if it wasn't for some of the language and horrific visuals. It's a fun movie, and gives the viewer something to think about. But I hope to see Bong return to something like Memories Of Murder, or Mother. Just a good story, with good characters. Sly humor, and dramatic lengths. To me, I think Bong Joon Ho is one of the greatest movie makers since Stanley Kubrick and Martin Scorcese, and I'd hate to see him get compromised by 'the system' in order to deliver commercially friendly and marketable product in a cost efficient and timely manner. In a sense, I feel that's why he took on Okja and may see his own career in it all as well? As fun as it all was, I too hope Bong will 'return to the mountains' for his next film.",Okja
105,vosnescis,"Terrible, has potential, but terrible",1,23 October 2018,"It didn't make sense to have the leader of the ALF or whatever it's called physically abuse one of its members for thinking of the bigger picture. Felt unreal and sucked me right out of the movie, as I would imagine to these ""peaceful people"" that being kicked out of such a meaningful movement is punishment enough. That part disgusted me because I could see a kind of justified passion from the director, which continued throughout the movieThe sheer level of ... ""gayness"" -- I want to say something else because it doesn't feel right to refer to anything over-the-top cheesy as gay. Hmm. Well, what would turn you off from watching Dora the Explorer as an adult? That is the kind of feeling this movie instills with the slow, ain't that cute, ain't that adorable, pointless scenes that don't really move anything along -- these scenes are just there to humanize the animal, which is another problem I had.The humanizing of the animal, and the CGI'ing and deviating from the reality of things, makes it seem like people can only relate to something like a Disney's animal sidekick, AKA a human in another form, never an ANIMAL, something unique, something with senses totally alien to us. So as I watch this CGI animal act human, save a girl with a rope, et cetera, the movie becomes less ""save the animals"" and more ""save this human created in a weird CGI body""Also, eating chicken and fish through the movie really spelled out something: This movie just promotes humane farming. It's all about eating the animals that are in our little family's cages out in the wild, and all about not eating those that are tortured in facilities. IMO this is not a vegan movie at all, it is 100% humane farming propaganda.The ending of the movie I was sitting with a 5/10 or 6/10 in mind, but as they're walking out of the place, free, two super pigs lift up a fence and are all, ""take our baby!"" -- the level of unreal cheesiness skyrocketed 5000%. Then all the super pigs, which are just weird interpretations of humans, begin to howl out together in perfect synergy.I think it's a terrible movie because of its unreality, thus objective poorness in quality. Subjectively I didn't like it because it wasn't at all vegan",Okja
106,blazedounal,Emotion best movie,9,4 August 2017,"Bong Joon Ho is without a doubt one of the top five or ten working directors today. Being a fan of the director's work, I built this movie a bit too much up in my head. But honestly -- it delivered on everything. It's funny, it's sad; there are happy moments, and deep emotional ones. But despite the drama and comedy going on in this, it also addresses problems going on in our world, and really made me think about these issues. I wasn't expecting to like this very much, but I loved it. The movie is success.In 2007, Lucy Mirando becomes CEO of the Mirando Corporation, succeeding her controversial grandfather, her father and her cruel twin sister Nancy. She announces that they have been breeding a special kind of superpig. Twenty-six of the best pigs will be sent to locations around the world, and ten years later, one will be crowned the winner.In 2017, a young girl named Mija lives happily in the countryside of South Korea with her grandfather and her super pig, Okja. They are visited by Mirando spokesperson and zoologist Dr. Johnny Wilcox, who declares Okja the best super pig and announces they will take her to New York City. Mija's grandfather takes her to visit the graves of her parents where he presents her with a gold pig and explains to her that rather than buy Okja, which was not allowed, he saved up the money for Okja and bought the solid gold item. Devastated, Mija runs away to Seoul to find Okja, where she sees her as she is being loaded onto a truck. Mija manages to chase down the truck which is eventually intercepted by another truck, run by the Animal Liberation Front (ALF). In the resulting chaos Mija and Okja run away causing havoc though they are eventually saved by the ALF. Recognizing that Mija is Okja's owner, they tell her that their plan is to put a recording device in Okja's ear and let her be re-captured by the Mirando corporation to show how brutally they treat their animals. Mija tells them to return her to the mountains but their translator, K, deliberately lies, causing the group to believe Mija went along with their plan of Animal Liberation Front.Meanwhile, footage of Okja and Mija running through the streets of Seoul has gone viral. In order to do damage control, Lucy pays for Mija to come to New York to be reunited onstage with her pig. Okja is taken to the laboratory where she is forcibly bred with another super pig. Members of the ALF overhear the recording through the device they placed in Okja's ear.In New York City, Mija spends her time learning bits of English and being forced to agree to the wishes of the Mirando corporation. Jay, the leader of ALF, slips into her room and tells her that they still plan to rescue Okja while on stage. Mija is reunited with Okja who, blinded and battered does not recognize her and attacks her. Mija calming Okja down by tell something in Okja ear so that she recognizes Mija. A video of Wilcox's treatment of Okja is screened by the ALF to the public, who quickly turn on him and Lucy. Mija and the ALF attempt to escape with Okja, but Nancy arrives back and quickly takes over the Mirando Corporation, recapturing Okja and having the ALF members beaten and arrested.Escaping, Jay and K take Mija to find Okja in a mass killing plant. The group search for Okja but are unable to find her until Mija sees her going up the ramp to the slaughterhouse. In order to save Okja she runs through the killing plant and sees many dead super pigs. Mija sees Okja as she is about to be slaughtered and shows the Mirando employee a photograph of herself with a baby Okja. The man seems moved, but Nancy arrives and tells Mija and the man that Okja must be slaughtered. Mija offers the golden pig to Nancy in exchange for Okja's life. Nancy agrees to the deal whilst subsequently arresting Jay and K. As Mija and Okja are leaving, they see many more pigs being led to slaughter. A pair of superpigs manages to push their newborn through the fence, and Okja hides it within her mouth to take it away.Back in the countryside, Mija resumes her life with her grandfather, Okja, and the new piglet. In a post-credits scene, Jay is released from prison and gets on board a bus with K and the other members of the organization, who reveals that ALF will be attending a major meeting involving all of the Mirando shareholders.",Okja
107,ConqueringRuler,Kids film for adults,5,1 July 2017,"First off, I really, really like the previous movies of Joon-ho Bong, he made some of the best South Korean movies ever, ""Memories of Murder"", ""Mother"", or ""The Host"", they are fantastic. So I had very high hopes for this one. Well I had some reservations after seeing the trailer on Netflix, ""little girl and some kind of cute monster thing?"". Anyway I thought Joon-ho Bong will deliver, like he did in the past. Unfortunately he did not really, at least not for me. I do like the whole critic on food and mass food production, that's the good part, and there are some nasty scenes in the factory later on with Okja, but my main problem is how he establishes the connection with Mija and Okja, that's just kids stuff. I was missing a darker tone, and usually you can't get that with a little girl in the movie (of course there are exceptions, just check my list ""Creepy kids""). For me the whole plot was too friendly and sometimes hardly believable. And that's my main problem, in a way it's a R-rated kids movie, so, who's the target audience?

The heart is there but the cgi to human American acting felt like a job more than a fun journey. A sort of ""where is the paycheck"" and ""no I really feel okja is there"" but, not really. It wasn't to the level of ""The Great Wall"" using a white actor as lead, but maybe animation or a total korean cast would have really felt better, if not the foreign cast of Americans a bit more connected to the story and magic itself.",Okja
113,patboldt,A Film that Almost Makes You A Vegetarian,7,5 January 2018,"When I decided to finally watch this movie I had no clue what to expect, but what I found was both entertaining and perplexing. This movie doesn't seem to have any idea what it is, but it still has some cool elements. I would call it a simple story but it honestly isn't and can be hard to follow, but at the same time it's layed out somewhat straightforward. Let me talk about what I liked. First off, the actress who played Mija was pretty good. Seo-hyun Ahn was a nice young lead who felt guinuine even if a bit unrealistic at times. I also liked Paul Dano in this movie believe it or not, I think he did better than his great performance in 12 Years A Slave, but he did have some strange moments. Some of the themes in this movie are quite strong and well reinforced even if somewhat blunt, and it did make me feel bad for eating meat, though not enough to make me a vegetarian. Liked the ALF members but wish we spent more time with them. The capture scene and riot scene in New York were some really cool scenes and I was sold on how they were rebels who didn't want to be terrorists. Now for the stuff I didn't like. First off I couldn't figure out if this movie was intended for children and failed miserably or intended for adults and not built enough. It's not a childrens movie because there is frequent profanity and graphic content, too much for any kids movie, but it's not for adults because there are also lots of kid friendly moments and interactions as well as childish portrayals of characters. I never took Tilda Swinton's character seriously, nor did I like Jake Gyllenhaal, and surprisingly, this is his worst performance I've ever seen. The plot also felt a bit too convienent at times and it felt like either A. the villains were just incompetent fools or B. that the kids were just having way too much luck on their side. Additionally, I thought it was a bit too friendly if it was trying to sell a theme about corporate greed and the evilness of the argicultural industry since the movie had such a happy ending. I honestly feel like it should have had a dark and depressing ending to really drive home, but I do understand why it ends the way it does. That said, I still enjoyed myself. It's a neat little movie, and it does sort of carry a modern fairy tale vibe even if not executed all that well. For a Netflix movie it wasn't half bad, though the CGI pig wasn't all that likable. Sure I sympathized for it but I didn't neccesarily feel that great of a reason for why everybody else does other than it being ""an animal"" and a modified one at that. Still, it's a pretty decent flick and for a korean audience it might be actually more enjoyable. Flawed movie but still enjoyable and fun to watch. 7/10.",Okja

I'm going to throw up a disclaimer right now: TRIGGER WARNING! There's horrifying visuals of animal cruelty, slaughter and overall mistreatment throughout this movie. It will tear your heart out people!Bong Joon-Ho is a fantastic director, point-blank-period! He really knows how to utilize space, colour, themes and actors to their fullest abilities. This movie is no exception. It's beautifully shot, seriously Bong Joon-Ho loves his cinematography and the colours really pop when they need to even though Okja herself is not brightly coloured. It's a great contrast, especially later on in the movie. Every actor in this stood out, obviously Ahn Seo-hyun did a fantastic job, god that kid tore me apart! Tilda Swinton and Jake Gyllenhaal both play crazy over-the-top characters, which worked for them but did take away from the narrative just a tad. Though I understood why they were like that. Seriously though I needed some laughs from them, Gyllenhaal had me dying at parts. The movie definitely has comedic moments but it's over shone by the heartfelt or tragic ones.So this movies overall plot is kind of apparent on the poster. But basically it's a very clever allegory referring to factory farming, animal consumption and mistreatment, as well as businesses profiting from the ""working man"" and off of the average citizens stupidity. All of which very real problems society faces, which is Bong Joon-Ho's specialty, take a very real problem and make it visually appealing to watch while telling us its messed up in various ways so stop it!It was hard enough seeing Okja being abused by companies team, but being ripped away from Mija AGAIN and being send to a slaughter house full of these creatures. Like I stated before very hard to watch. Bong Joon-Ho chose to portray this part of the movie in very real ways. Including killing animals via bolt gun to the head, stringing them up by their legs without heads, draining their blood and cutting them apart for meat. I understand why he did it, but it was way too real and brought me back to when I'd seen actual videos of these very real life things happening. Very powerful. Only he could make me break down over a creature that DOESN'T EVEN EXIST! I thought for a hot minute that Okja was going to die and I was not emotionally prepared for that!Other than all of that I loved that the golden pig from Mija's grandfather came back into play at the end. It felt right narratively and we get to see the animal right activists continue their journey after the credits, including MY MAN Choi Woo-shik who made an appearance! The only thing I can say is I wish we could've seen more negative outcomes falling upon Lucy, Nancy and Dr.Johnny. I know their lives are probably over after the parade showing, but I wanted to see them suffer.

125,sebastianschlicht,"Not easy to ""swallow""!",7,13 February 2020,"Bong Joon-ho has been known to me since ""Snowpiercer"". His success with ""Parasite"" from 2019 (four Oscars!) was completely deserved and also important. Now my interest in his films is greater than ever. Thanks to ""Netflix"" you can watch one of these films without any problems: ""Okja"".
Joon-ho's work from 2017 is a critical, albeit beautiful answer to factory farming and its dark side. Here he takes a well-known story, but it´s shown from a completely new perspective.The Mirando Corporation has the idea to breed genetically optimized pigs and let them grow for ten years with different farmers around the world. There are several goals: Better meat, fewer animal excretions and less food they need. Ten years later, the giant super pig from Mija and her grandfather is to be brought to the opening parade in New York as the ""best pig"", but Mija and her pig Okja have become best friends ...""Okja"" is action-packed, funny and sometimes hard to bear. What is initially a cute film between a girl and her animal friend quickly turns into something terrible. Don't worry, Bong Joon-ho didn't make a film like ""Funny Games"" here, but you should be prepared for something bittersweet. But that´s exactly what makes his kind of films so exciting and unpredictable. You never know how the film will develop. Joon-ho never makes his viewers feel safe, even if that sometimes leads to painful abysses. But it is precisely these abysses that make a film like ""Okja"" something special, a film that can move.
As an animal lover, it was sometimes difficult for me to look, although the animals here are ""only"" large, fictional CGI-creatures. In the end the message of ""Okja"" comes across very strongly.The film is still not Joon-ho's best work. The story has its rough edges, some characters are not as three-dimensional as in other films and I also enjoyed the balancing act between story and social criticism much more in ""Snowpiercer"" and above all ""Parasite"".As with ""Snowpiercer"", the cast contains a lot of big, well-known actors like Tilda Swinton, Paul Dano and even Jake Gyllenhaal. But there are also some South Korean actors, such as the young lead actress Ahn Seo-hyeon. Everyone is definitely good, Gyllenhaal is certainly the most striking, but the focus is on the story and the macabre and perverse idea with which the film plays.The CGI effects are really convincing, which was of course necessary. While it wasn't so important for ""Snowpiercer"" that the effects look perfect, the big, fictional animals had to appear believable and real here. The camera work is very nice and Jeong Jae-il's score is coherent and touching.Conclusion: ""Okja"" may not be Bong Joon-ho's best film, but it will be one that will stay in my head for a long time. And I hope that it will achieve this with many other people too!",Okja
126,robojames,Tearjerking Attack On Corporate Greed,8,14 March 2021,"It's kind of impossible to tell who Okja was aimed at. Ostensibly it looks like a kids' film but it's way too dark and sophisticated for that. The tone and even genre of the film are all over the place too, but with these Netflix releases that show in very few theatres I suppose it doesn't matter... they're part of a composite sales pitch to pull in those subscriptions.Okja is a giant 'superpig' that has been bred to provide delicious meat at a low environmental cost by a company called Mirando, a thinly veiled fictional equivalent to Monsanto, I guess. This corporation is the villain of the piece, a vile, inhumane, money-grabbing, capitalist horror show of an entity. Mirando strikes you as a burlesque caricature until it hits you, later in the film, that what these people are doing to the movie's beautifully-rendered CGI creatures is probably happening in even worse versions to the animal species we eat in real life.Some of the other reviews are critical of this film and I understand why. It's wild, difficult to process, unpredictable and absurd in places, but if you go with it it's a moving and effective tale that makes you think about ethics, the value of life and the impact of your own existence on other earthlings.If I have to nitpick at it, I'll say that some of the humour involving the Animal Liberation Front characters is awkward and doesn't really land. I wasn't sure how I was supposed to view them, as goofy and harmless, as the type of person we should respect and encourage, as hopelessly naive, or as intrepid heroes to emulate? They sort of existed as gears in the narrative rather than well-drawn characters and some of the scenes they were in made me cringe slightly.All told, though, this is an emotionally effective, exciting, peculiar and very different movie and I recommend it to adults and as a great bedtime tale for any children you want to traumatise into vegetarianism.",Okja

Heck, they'd probably engineer them to look hideous or frightful so nobody would care if they got butchered. People are biased like that. Just ask snakes and spiders.It's such a propaganda piece for ALF and PETA it borders on childish and self-satirizing at times.It's competent in its construction, and that's its only saving grace, since the message is pretty heavy-handed.As for those who allow a FANTASY to tell them how to live their lives and what REAL-LIFE decisions to make... you need to grow up.

Combining a proper sense of quirkiness and wit, the film's clever message resonated through me even after watching it. I wouldn't call it a piece of vegetarian propaganda, though I can see why people find it too preachy to be entertaining. For me, this film is more of a portrait of political cinema, on how the cycle of abuse works in the industry, and how the corporation has two faces: the smiling, jubilant heads they show to the public and the dirty, notorious brains they have, grabbing for money, behind the screen.It isn't so much as an anti-meat film despite some of the plot points presented (even with an inclusion of an Animal Liberation Front group). The subject of the film is this super-pig hybrid which is supposed to serve as a revolutionary change in the meat industry. Just like the animal, this film is a cross-breed of different genres, it is a satirical movie at first, then turning into an adventure film, and, once it moves to the third act, becomes a poignant view of the relationship between a young Korean girl and her pet. This clash of genres don't always mix well, but I personally thought that the film was really effective in trying to engage its viewers into the story and into the journey of this young girl going through a personal transformation as she realizes that corporations and media aren't always as innocent as they seem. Even the design of the super-pig is superb, it feels real and tangible and it doesn't overdo the CGI, which is great.The performances across the board are fantastic. Among those that stand out are Ahn Seo- hyun, who really is the underdog protagonist of the film, Tilda Swinton, the head of the expensive industry, and Jake Gyllenhaal, who puts sort of a quirky and charismatic magic into his character, Dr. Johnny Wilcox. The first half of the film is excellent, while the second half didn't really do a good job of tying all the subplots together, so some of the narratives really fell loose during the end. I did like what turned out of Mija and Okja, but I wanted to see some resolution for the other narratives, especially the Animal Rights group led by Paul Dano's character.Okja is a great spectacle, combining enough weird lopsidedness to it while still feeling realistic in a dystopian, sci-fi, coming of age style. I did like how Joon-Ho tackled issues of corporate capitalism, but this film could've improved on how it transitioned between genres and on how the tiny narrative coincided together at the end.

The acting is intentionally over the top, but it works for some characters and not for others. Most character quirks and oddities are just random and serve no purpose to the overall story. On the other hand, the main girl and Okja were a cute match and I enjoyed watching them together. Unfortunately, this movie just didn't do it for me.",Okja

142,danielefanin-17409,A Modern Day Fairytale,6,30 May 2020,"Two years before taking Hollywood by storm with Parasite, the first non-English speaking movie to bag an Oscar for Best Film, South Korean director Bong Joon Ho presented in 2017 at Cannes Okja, his second American movie after the promising Snowpiercer in 2013 and a remarkable series of good film made at home.Originally booed at Cannes because a Netflix production, hence without cinema release, the delicate yet aggressive modern fairytale of Okja was able to make an impact for its good storytelling, something nowadays not always found, and that was able to touch the heart of many viewers.Mixing elegiac moments, particularly in the first part set in Korea and focused on the delicate relationship between the ""beast"" Okja, the genetically modified superpig produced by ruthless capitalists, and the ""beauty"", the young girl with a big lion-heart, with other sof pure action, like the beautifully filmed truck chase through the streets of Seoul, echoing 007 and M:I movies, Okja succeeds in keeping a good narrative balance, solving within the fairytale the problems represented by an excess of leads, interesting but not always properly developed, particularly for some of the Animal Liberation Front characters, and some up and down performance of both Tilda Swinton and, even more so, an usually much more composed Jake Gyllenhaal, that in some scenes look like a Wes Anderson's film waste.Maybe Okja is not an exceptional movie but it is surely interesting and never banal, even when touching on potentially obvious topics like the juxtaposition between animal rights activists and the foodstuff industry. Indeed, it is a movie worth watching for its crafted narrative, the simple originality of the story and the ability of the director, patently confirmed by Parasite, to master at the same time different tones, like fairytale, comedy, drama, social criticism, making sure that oscillating from one to the other, even when not very linear, never looks forced or imposed. In addition to sprinkle the movie with some hidden quotes for the film buffs, Bong Joon Ho ends the movie with an interesting and open ending, where on purpose there is not a clear winner and the question of who really won the battle, and even more so who will win the war, remains sadly open.",Okja

144,Grethiwha,A Wildly Awesome Dark Comedy and Much-Needed Satire on the Food Industry,9,10 May 2020,"Bong Joon-ho's first English-language feature, Snowpiercer, was an absolute home-run for me, and possibly my favourite film of the decade. A wild satire of class inequality set on a post-apocalyptic science-fiction train, Snowpiercer is one of the most creative films in recent memory, completely unpredictable, with each new train car introducing a new twist, elevated by Bong Joon-ho's dark sense of humour and the completely insane characters he populates his universe with. Tilda Swinton's performance is particularly notable.And Snowpiercer isn't even Bong's best movie; Memories of Murder and Mother are bonafide classics, at this point. Suffice it to say, that I was incredibly excited for Okja, even though I purposely avoided reading anything about it prior to watching it. I had no idea what Okja was going to be about, and, well, I was completely blown away by what it turned out to be.As it turns out, Okja is, I would say, a close sister film to Snowpiercer. It is every bit as creative and unpredictable, darkly hilarious and filled with Bong Joon-ho's classic insane characters, as Snowpiercer was. Tilda Swinton even returns, to give her performance in that film a run for its money, and this time she has some competition from the likes of Jake Gyllenhaal, who has never given a performance as wild as this one.But whereas Snowpiercer satirizes class inequality, Okja is a satire of the food industry, a subject matter I think is long overdue for satirizing, which I never would have expected from Bong (or any Korean filmmaker), but which he absolutely nailed. I would like to focus the rest of my review on this point, because I think it's extremely important.Okja is about a little girl, Mija, who's grown up on a small Korean farm in the mountains with her grandfather, and her best friend, a genetically-modified ""super-pig"" given to them by a big American company to raise, as part of a marketing campaign. When it comes time to introduce this new ""environmentally sustainable"" super-pig meat to market, unbeknownst to Mija, her super-pig is to be flown back to America for a promotional event, and ultimately to be slaughtered. When she finds out her grandfather relinquished the pig behind her back, Mija - a precocious, determined child - sets out on her own to get her friend back. Her journey ultimately puts her at the crossroads between a slew of crazy characters from the American company, ""Mirando Corp"" (including Tilda Swinton and Jake Gyllenhaal) and an extremist animal rights activist group called the ""Animal Liberation Front"" (including Paul Dano and Steven Yeun).Although Bong Joon-ho is in top form here, I feel that Okja has been largely overlooked, even dismissed by many of Bong's fans as his worst film, and the ""criticism"" that I've heard about it is that it's ""anti-meat"", or even ""vegan propaganda"". I was taken off-guard when I first heard this, since I really didn't see it this way at all, and the attack essentially nullifies my recommendation of the film, as someone who happens to abstain from animal products. That said, I think this perspective is absurd for all kinds of reasons, that are easy enough to reel off.For a start, Bong Joon-ho, who wrote this movie, eats meat, and comes from a culture where veganism hardly exists. The characters we're meant to sympathize or identify with, the rural Korean farmers, are seen eating chicken and fish, sustainably, off their farm. Moreover, the only presumably ""vegan"" characters, the animal activist characters, are depicted as completely ridiculous and impossible to take seriously (Paul Dano's best scene has him kicking the crap out of an incapacitated Steven Yeun, Goodfellas-style, for betraying their group's commitment to non-violence). Finally, the word ""vegan"" is never uttered and the concept never comes up in the script.What the film does do, however, is what all good dark comedies do (and Okja is above-all a good dark comedy), and that is to ground its fantasy in harsh realities; to look at reality head-on, without illusions, and create something from out of that reality to make me smile. This is not a cartoon, where the funny talking farm animals go on an adventure, and every effort is made to avoid us making any connection between those farm animals, and our dinner. In Okja, when the journey eventually takes us to a slaughterhouse, Bong, who visited a slaughterhouse in research for the film, depicts the slaughterhouse, roughly, as a slaughterhouse. Some people find these scenes upsetting; since I personally have no illusions about what slaughterhouses are, I wasn't upset just by being reminded that they exist; I was simply engaged in the insane drama unfolding there. If a film depicting a slaughterhouse as a slaughterhouse makes you feel you're being moralized to, I can't help you. If you think a film is ""vegan propaganda"" because it depicts a slaughterhouse like a slaughterhouse, I think that says more about your own insecurity about your food choices that it does the film.But maybe more importantly, I think it says something about the way this subject matter is just kind of a taboo across Hollywood and media generally. How often does food sustainability come up in the realm of non-documentary movies? Some basic facts: the animal agriculture industry is the biggest polluter in the world by far, animals in factory farms are often treated far worse than anything depicted in Okja, and a drastic reduction in global meat consumption is necessary to have any chance of halting climate change. (A properly-planned whole-foods plant-based diet is also the healthiest way to eat, by the way). These are just basic facts that everybody should know, and which shouldn't be controversial in any way, and yet which are so omitted from the conversation, that when you even approach this subject matter it is somehow contentious. And I think that's a strength of Okja, that it's about the only fiction film I can think of that even approaches this important subject matter.Interestingly, another film came out in the same year as Okja, with a strikingly similar plot: The Shape of Water by Guillermo del Toro. The Shape of Water is also about a girl (or woman) who develops a relationship with a fantasy creature, only to have to rescue the creature from an evil corporation (and an over-the-top villain) that ""owns"" the creature and plans to do it harm. I loved The Shape of Water and found it extremely engaging for many of the same reasons as I did Okja, although I generally found Okja to be a bit more wild and enjoyable. Where The Shape of Water differs thematically from Okja, however, is in what the creature represents. While Okja, the super-pig, satirizes the food industry, the creature in The Shape of Water is a parable for racism, if anything; at any rate a more ""safe"" subject matter. It's interesting that that film went on to win the top prize at the Oscars, while Okja was pretty much ignored at awards season.Following Okja, Bong Joon-ho returned to the ""more safe"" (but equally important) class inequality theme from Snowpiercer with a much more toned down, scaled back (but still flawlessly executed) film called Parasite, which, also quite interestingly, became the first foreign-language film to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards. I couldn't be happier for his win, or the spotlight it's put on Korean cinema, however I can't help but wish he'd received this attention two years earlier, when he really, really deserved it, for making a truly original and phenomenal film on a topic nobody else is apparently brave enough to touch. Okja was easily my favourite film of the year in 2017, and as I'm still thinking about it and writing about it three years later, I have to say it's another strong candidate for my favourite film of the decade.",Okja
145,jean0519,"Boring, Long, and Boring",4,5 July 2017,"Who was this movie made for? It starts as a cute little story about a GMO pig/hippo who's loved by the girl who raised her in the mountains of Korea. The animal is intelligent, understands English AND Korean, and is a gentle giant. Sounds like a kid's movie, right? Well it's full of eff-bombs, harrowing situations, and a couple of characters get the crap beat out of them, showing gratuitous gore. So is it for adults? Jake Gyllenhaal is a great actor, so I'll blame the director for turning him into a shrill, cartoonish, malevolent sadist. Tilda Swinton is a great actor, so I'll blame the writer(s) for making her irredeemably horrible. Is it a message movie? Is it about the evil of GMOs? Because the pig-thing is the best thing in the movie, and I want one. Is it about the evil of carnivores? Nothing shows us anything but that animals die to give us meat.

151,sossevarvo,Probably the most insanely inconsistent movie I've ever seen,7,27 June 2017,"Bong Joon Ho is a masterful director. Memories of Murder is a stunningly evocative police procedural. The Host is a terrifically bombastic monster movie. Snowpiercer is a bracingly exciting and insightful sci fi film. So, going into Okja, I had high expectations. What's most strange about the film is it managed to surpass all expectations I had, in alternately brilliant, and utterly misguided, ways. It's one of the best and worst films of the year, all at the same time, and this insanely mixed reaction I had to the film is probably due to the fact that it is so fearlessly original and inventive, for better or worse. The good? Well, the concept, a near future where ""super pigs"" are discovered, and a grand PR scheme to publicise this new potential meat superseller through farmers across the world and a ""Super Pig"" contest, is undeniably ingenious and deliriously wacky. The central relationship (the super pig Okja and pint-sized owner Mija) is emotionally resonant and makes for so many delightful moments. There is an extended sequence through (and under) the streets of Seoul that is for my money the most exhilarating and spectacular chase/action sequence in recent memory, all the while doubling as an incisive political statement. But when the film goes to America, all the subtlety is thrown away. Tilda Swinton is engaging in small doses, but her character is so obscenely caricaturish that you ultimately care nothing for her. And Jake Gyllenhaal.... wow. I held this actor in such high regard for his chameleonic actor sensibility, in countless films delivering extraordinary and SUBTLE performances, and in Okja he does the unthinkable: he is genuinely, properly, scene-chewingly terrible. Mustachioed, squeaky-voiced and not at all funny, he is pure dead air whenever he is on screen. What Bong-Joon Ho was thinking with this character I don't know. The most glaring flaw with the film is the way in which it tonally backflips as soon as it heads to America. Gone are the enjoyable flights of fancy of Seoul, and the madcap fun, and in come the heavy handed politicising and emotional manipulation. Bong-Joon Ho abandons his spellbinding narrative in order to sermonise to his audience about the ills of capitalist America (through beating us over the head with the cruelty of the food industry). The presence of the Paul Dano-led Animal Liberation Front as side- characters is equally perplexing. One second we're meant to root for them, the next we're meant to laugh at their naivety, and the next we're to condemn them, before we suddenly love them. Perhaps Bong Joon Ho is trying to make some assertion about the innate corruptibility of everyone, that there is no winner in these political debates, and we can only rely on the warmth of a girl and her superpig to give us some emotional solace. Well, to be frank, that's not profound, it's a cinematic cop out. By the end of the film, I felt depressed, because of the visceral emotional blackmail I was treated to by Bong Joon-Ho, and because a masterpiece turned into something that was utterly incoherent. All this being said, Okja is absolutely worth seeing, just for how incredibly strange and sporadically magnificent it is. While I am against the new tide of online streaming, I credit Netflix for the sheer courage to fund 50 million dollars into a film so wildly uncommercial. I was lucky enough to see the film on a big screen at the Sydney Film Festival, and even though it is a Netflix film, I couldn't help feeling it belonged in a cinema. Still, a film such as Okja, which fiercely blends comedy, drama, environmental tub-thumping, bizarre slapstick, action, not to mention the fact that it is so Korean in tone, style and lead actors, and much of the settings, despite the presence of American actors.",Okja
152,muhammedchand5,Great performances and direction,8,2 July 2017,Overall a fantastic move. I do recognize that they're definitely pushing an anti-livestock messages BUT I think it's absolutely great that it's presented in this manner. Tilda Swinton gives an interesting performance as Lucy. A bit narration heavy at the start to setup the concept right at the beginning but she does pull the crazed corporate CEO off well. I do wish they explored a bit more with regard to her relationship with her father. The supporting cast did fantastic as ALF in particular Paul Dano did a fantastic job as a composed rebel (kinda want to see him in Wes Anderson movie). Finally and most importantly Seo-Hyun Ahn delivers a fantastic performance with Okja. I usually pause when I see child actors in western movies but she gets it down to a T. The heartbreak and realization you feel at the end through her eyes is really moving at the end. I've watched the Host by Bong Joon Ho and his direction is quite evident in the shots. The awareness of how to pan and capture a scene is evident and I particularly liked the scene where Jay beats Kay. The camera dolly's to the left and you don't see the beating but just hear it. Pretty clever way to avoid a higher rating but still cleverly carrying the scene.,Okja
153,alombardy,Hits surprisingly hard,9,28 July 2017,"Full disclaimer; I am a vegetarian, so I was always going to be sympathetic to the message of this film. And while some would argue, perhaps correctly in most cases, that the medium IS the message, it doesn't always hold that a noble sentiment translates into a well made film. Thankfully this is not the case here.A whirlwind mash of genres (part heist movie; part buddy comedy; part activist polemic) Okja is a beautifully executed interweaving of the complex and deep relationship between humanity and the other animals that inhabit our planet. Despite (obviously) heavy use of CGI for Okja herself, the Super Pig's presence is (mostly) seamless with the rest of the environment, and its convincing and moving interactions with the rest of the cast, not least a starring performance from young Seo Hyun as Mija, were enough to move me to tears more than once.At no point does the film verge into 'preachiness', however, nor wander into grisly animal-rights documentary territory. It achieves this through interspersing some nicely shot action scenes with the odd absurdist comic line, before, towards the end of the film, revealing in jarring and emotional fashion the logical consequence of mass, production-line slaughter. And that really is the main takeaway from the film; not that MEAT=BAD, but rather that the industrialised killing our profit-driven society has allowed to develop is an unbearable and heartbreaking infringement of the rights of the living beings with which we must share our earth.Perhaps the only reservation is Jake Gyllenhaal's bizarre performance as Johnny Wilcox. I personally didn't have that much of a problem with it, although can see why the OTT nature of it might pull one out of the film on occasion. Nonetheless, Okja is a film bold in its scale and confident in its message. At once gentle and brutal; funny and poignant, I really can't give this film any more praise without it sounding like I'm a Netflix plant.

This film is the most family-friendly of his that I've seen so far (probably even more so than ""The Host""), and it's also his sweetest. The plot: In an effort to combat the impending food shortage brought on by overpopulation, the sinister Mirando Corporation (let by the always-welcome Tilda Swinton) genetically engineers a race of superpigs who require few resources to raise, then ships 26 of them out to farms all over the world as part of a contest to see who can raise the healthiest one. Ten years later, little Mija (Seo-Hyeon Ahn), who has grown up with the eponymously-named superpig as a pet and perhaps even friend, learns from her grandfather that they have to send it back to America to be slaughtered. She decides to do something about it.""Okja"" mixes lowbrow humor, chase scenes, social commentary, and a few elements of outright horror. It's not entirely successful. Some side characters and subplots seem half-baked, but the film deserves immense credit for sidestepping many of the clichés and pitfalls that plague films that deal with young protagonists having adventures and teaching adults lessons in the process. Along the way, Mija meets the Animal Liberation Front, a well-meaning but naive animal rights organization who both helps and hinders her along the way. Their leader is played by Paul Dano, another actor I've enjoyed in just about everything I've ever seen him in.This film is not entirely happy, nor is it entirely cynical. It's about as hopeful as it can be in telling the story of one girl and a couple of do-gooders who try to take down a gigantic corporation. I recommend this film to anyone who is looking for something different. It definitely isn't perfect, but it will stick with you.

This is the type of movie that can inspire a generation to change the way our food is produced.Okja is a visual masterpiece, from the sweeping green hills of Japan to the crowded Subway tunnels in Seoul to the dank insides of an actual meat production facility. The stark contrasts in this movie really create an emotional turbulence that is at times beautiful and other times deeply unsettling.Tilda is as eye catching as ever and showcases her enormous acting talent by portraying two very different sisters in temperament - one that is stern and business minded and one that is more ditzy and.feminine. I thought this was a great display of her range of talent.Animal agriculture is a behemoth industry with a main motive to make money; however, as consumers we each have a choice to make.

Easily, it's the new Netflix release, ""Okja"", a fairy tale with an ominous message. Rated MA-TV, this film is clearly not for young children, due to language and violence. But, ten-year-old's and up will enjoy this, especially with the scatological humor coming from the star's frequent flatulism and ability to poop on demand. While, at times a bit sophomoric for adults, the flick holds its own, gaining from an excellent cast, terrific CGI and good direction. The plot line is set in the future when a driven daughter of a billionaire businessman decides to ""solve"" the world's hunger problem by cloning ""super pigs"", that are genetically engineered to produce enormous, exceptionally nutritious products. Tilda Swinton is cast as Lucy Mirando, who stops at nothing to realize her ten- year quest, with enormous profits at the end of the rainbow. Jake Gyllenhaal is unrecognizable as Johnny Wilcox, a sort of smarmy Jack Hannah, who is employed by Lucy to lend credibility to her plan. The always wonderful Shirley Henderson is Lucy's efficient and mindful aide, Jennifer. As soon as Ms. Henderson opens her mouth, you will immediately recognize her unique voice; think ""Moaning Myrtle"" from the Harry Potter series. Twelve cloned piglets are assigned to be raised by the best farmers all over the world, each competing for the ""best pig"" title and a generous monetary award. The plot keys in on teenage Mija and her grandfather, who are rearing the female Okja in the mountains of Korea. Mija and Okja are inseparable; she sleeps with the swine that is the size of an adult rhinoceros! All hell breaks loose when Okja is declared the winner and Mija is heartbroken when she is told that the pig will be shipped off to New York City for the awards ceremony. A fringe group of PETA wanna- be's, headed by Paul Dano's Jay and assisted by Red (Lily Collins), move in to save Okja from Lucy's dastardly deeds.

The special effects were also very nice, even if the super pigs look frightening to me. So why have I rated it a 1? Well because the anti-science message present with the implication GMO foods are bad is an incredibly harmful message and the presentation that we should distrust scientific breakthroughs in GMOs based on nothing but fear of the unknown is toxic.I started it out at a 7 and every time it started scaremongering about GMOs I took a point away. I stopped when it reached one because I was unable to give it a lower score.The movie makes good points about capitalism, and I suppose it makes good points about the ethical treatment of animals(though the day I go vegan there will be ice skating in Satan's backyard) but it really hurts everything by being anti-science. I don't mind preachiness in movies typically, I do mind it when they are preachy and wrong.",Okja

I mean you will definitely think about it.this movie shows what a human can do for love even if it's for an animal.you are going to get back any possible way. the natural landmarks in the movie are marvelous.

166,danwin-14834,A children's film with violence and profanity,6,19 April 2019,"Okja succeeds in spreading message, buy personally doesn't stay memorable. The film teeters on the line of dark comedy and a kids film and it feels like the both merge in a very strange way, the two tones do clash with each other frequently. I was convinced the film could have been for kids if they had trimmed the profanity but then that shocking deliciously dark ending comes on screen and I instantly realise why. Personally I would have preferred if the film had more of this but it focuses on comedy which I am fine with but that is just my preference. I found Jake Gyllenhaal and Tilda Swinton very watchable and every time they were on screen it was a blast (I am a bit of a Gyllenhaal fanboy so I have to praise him).",Okja
167,harrisonwelshsfs,This big piggy went to NY,7,26 February 2020,"Bong Joon-Ho shows off his talent for thoughtful genre bending cinema in this sci-fi, comedy, drama, about a young girl named Mija and her journey to save her best friend the super pig, Okja from the Mirando Corporation. It is in the gradual reveal of the corporation's inhumane operations, the layered morality and motivations of the characters and the heightened reality of the world where the film shines, elevating the simple story to something far more interesting and complex.At first it is hard to suspend your disbelief watching Mija a real human interacting with the giant CGI pig. But, the opening ten minutes does such an excellent job setting up their relationship and Okja's endearing personality that you quickly believe in her as a very real and lovable character. The story that follows is simple enough, Okja is taken away by the Mirando Corporation and Mija sets out to rescue her. With minimal dialogue and keen visual storytelling, we learn that Okja and Mija's relationship is closer to that of best friends or even family rather than pet and owner. It is this strong relationship which is the emotional core and central drive of the story, possessing an almost tangible quality despite the two being separated for most of the runtime.The film has obvious critiques of factory farming and unethical consumerism, but more nuance can be found in the great cast of supporting characters all with varying moral fortitude and motivations. Lucy Mirando, played by Tilda Swinton is the face of the Mirando corporation, motivated primarily by a want for positive perception which is interesting in that although the intent is selfish it results in some positive effects. Nancy Mirando also played by Swinton on the other hand is motivated by money with little care for public perception, her selfishness is far more overt. Johnny Wilcox, the wildlife expert played by Jake Gyllenhaal is motivated by status, he wants to maintain his fame and position within the Mirando Corporation, this forces him to commit acts of cruelty against animals, creatures which he seemingly has a genuine appreciation for. The intrinsic contradiction being ultimately self-destructive. Even the Animal Liberation Front allow Okja to be put in harms way in the hopes of exposing Mirando's cruelty, going against their mission to protect all animals. What is important here is that none of these characters are presented as evil but rather they do evil things, encouraging the consideration of both intent and results in the judgement of character.The film is shot with pleasing composition and the editing has a good sense of rhythm but Okja is somewhat lacking in overall execution, there doesn't seem to be the same style or attention to detail of the director's stronger work. However, Bong Joon Ho's ability to play across multiple genres within the one film, add complexity to what could have easily been caricatures, and present a clear message while also working in layers of morality are proof that he is a unique filmmaker and that this film is certainly worth the watch.",Okja
168,introclusor,Massively Overrated,4,7 July 2017,"This film was an absolute mess. It felt as though it didn't know what it wanted to be throughout the entire film. Bouncing back and forth between Schindler's List and Grown Up's 2 with overly stereotypical characters that are either pure evil or saints. There was barely a story line to this film, only forced emotion which you will become aware of when it hits you during three scenes in the film. I will give them credit for forcing emotion in these tiny moments but I do not appreciate the method in which they do it. Its nothing more than lazy writing in my opinion. Even though I am only giving this film four stars (partly due to Jake Gyllenhaal's strange performance), I would recommend that you watch it. If only to witness a unique mash up of genres which will only serve to irritate you to no end. It's still worth sitting through it so you can see how out of touch movie critics are these days.",Okja

Yes this movie does have an underlining message on the exploitation of animals for the meat industry. However it makes good points while telling a heart warming story. The acting was good, there were a few attempts at comedy which I did feel failed abit and did not aid to the story, however the movie does bring a tear to your eye. The animated animals, mainly okja was done extremely well, the films lighting and editing was spot on. The foreign language made it feel more authentic. I think Jake Gyllenhaal's acting was under par, however the character was needed for the message the movie wants to portray. One have to give the director and writers credit, although the story was not over complex it did bring the emotion and love to the screen for an animal that actually does not exist.

To get a truly original movie is special and with the Netflix's Okja, we have gotten one of the most original movies in recent memory and one of the best movies so far this year, I'm serious.Okja focuses on the relationship between Mija, played Seo-Hyun Ahn and a giant pig named Okja and Mija has to try and save Okja from a giant company that plans on kidnapping her giant animal friend for their own devious reasons. There are several fantastic things about Ojka that make this movie the best I have seen so far this year and the one film so far this year that I can call an experience. All the performances in this movie range great to phenomenal with the two stand out performances those being, Seo-Hyun Ahn and Jake Gyllenhaal. Jake Gyllenhaal once again proves that he is one of the most dynamic actors working today and is memorizing in this movie. Now not everyone will love his performance as some might see it as too over the top, but as for me, I thought he did a great job. Seo-Hyun Ahn owns this movies. The relationship between her and Okja is the driving force behind this movie and it is very compelling to watch and she is amazing throughout the film. All the other performances are great too and this is helped by a fantastic script that makes all the events flow together and top notch direction by Joon-Ho Bong, who also wrote the script as well. The films is also very well constructed from cinematography to editing the movie is built perfectly. As for the emotional payoff it is mostly satisfying. I say ""mostly"" because, maybe this is just me, but I wanted the film to be little bit longer to have some more closure, but overall this movie affected me deeply and made me question the real world. That isn't easy to do.In the end, Okja is nothing short of an amazing movie. The scene of adventure, the emotion are so strong and powerful that I just was blown away by it when the credits rolled. The acting, directing, writing, everything was fantastic. I wish the film was maybe a tiny bit longer, but in the end, Okja is the best film I have seen so far this year and I do wish this movie was showing in theaters across the world and not just on Netflix because it deserves all the praise in the world and then some.",Okja

There must be an assembly line,where cows and pigs must line up,awaiting their turn to get slaughtered.I am a vegetarian,but am no fundamentalist.I dunt care what you eat,be it calves or human kids.But what you eat must feel the pain,if pain exists.I dunt know where does that logic take you philosophically.I also know that if everyone gives up eating meat,the planet wud end up starving.But still,the slain animals must cry out in agony.Killing them for food must affect karma.Okja is the story of a superpig ,one of the twenty six produced in a lab in the US by a GM Food MNC and being reared in the idyllic,beautiful,picturesque mountains of Korea by a teenage girl and her grandfather.Having grown up together ,Okja and the girl share a deep emotional bond.Enter Jake Gyllenhall and his crew to fly away the superpig back to the US where the plan is to unveil it to the public as promotional propaganda and then use it in the factory line to manufacture sausages.The Korean girl ,along with Animal Rights'activists create mayhem in the streets and malls of Seoul and later in the US,and finally liberate Okja.The film asks questions about MNC's greed,animal rights and GM food safety.Surprisingly,the director manages to not let the script degenerate into any kind of general war,and the struggle always remains personal (for Okja and the girl).This is perhaps the best film of the year I have seen so far.It must claim Best Picture nomination ,and win the Best Foreign film Oscar.Bong Joon-ho has balanced the pitch dark satirical tone of the film with some exquisite action sequences (esp.in the first half),over-the-top performances by Gyllenhall and Tilda Swinton and subtle drama .It is a heady cocktail that works on many levels as a children's film (despite the swearings),a propaganda piece (against GM) and a campaign for animal rights,but commits to nothing .This is the triumph of technology and imagination,a movie to remember.",Okja

Our inborn and conditioned desire to consume these living creatures must end. Vegans are paving the way, but the final rainbow is out of sight. Okja is a perfect example of so many things, including directing, acting, and of course, the unforgettable subject matter. If I was able to stop eating animal products over two years ago, anyone can.

The movie takes place in a fictional 2017, in which the world faces the thread of hunger and a company named Mirando finds this a solution creating a new kind of pig which can grow to be bigger than an average human.Problem with the movie starts in this point of the plot. Mirando company, ruled by Lucy Mirando, plans to end the threat of global starvation by creating an animal of which all parts are edible and can basically be raised in any geographical conditions in anywhere in the world. This is the main problem with the movie. Lucy Mirando, supposedly the ""villain"" of the movie, is actually can be seen as a genius who found a reliable source of food to help the world. Movie includes slaughterhouse scenes to convince the viewer that this company is bad and torturing animals but it does not work. The way those pigs are treated in the movie is not different than chickens and cows are treated everyday today in real life. however, this is necessary for human kind to survive and grow.ideologically, gdo food is necessary to feed 7 billion people in the world. of course it is much safer and healthier to consume organic food, it is also very expensive to have for 80% of people around the world. So, while world hunger is still a problem in real world, a movie, which shows a company that might actually have found a reliable way to end this problem is not convincing in any way.this movie is made just for high income vegetarian community who does not worry much about the problem of lack of nutrition in communities of other countries-communities. unless you are of them, this movie is a waste of time and money.3/10",Okja

The leap that all animals eaten are in parallel to Okja is ridiculous. Do we need to remind you Okja is fictional? This movie was an overzealous approach leveraging character development of a fictional animal in an effort to show direct parallels to our current food supply, which is totally unfair. I've been a vegan and then a vegetarian based on the inhumane treatment of animals in the 80's. The fight should always be for their ethical treatment. Dogs, while eaten in some cultures, are regarded worldwide as pets because of their empathy and domestication. They are not part of the mass food supply because of this, and that's a good thing.

202,Zakliz477,"Bold and Entertaining in equal measure, without skimping on the Food for Thought",10,29 June 2017,"Okja is the story of a girl and her mutant pig, the titular Okja, told in the same vain as E.T. Or Pete's Dragon. But it's also a satire of Corporate America, a heist film of sorts, and a expose on the moral conflicts of food production. Now to some that sounds like a recipe for disaster, but in the hands of Bong Joon Ho (One of the most exciting directors working today, a statement further cemented by the quality of Okja) it's one of the best films of 2017. Okja in all its brilliance, might be Bong Joon Ho's most accessible movie yet, but it's also probably one of the strangest things your likely to see all year. Here Joon-Ho further demonstrates his mastery of his filmmaking craft, effortlessly juggling tones and genres, composing scenes that brim with drama and excitement , and leaving audiences with another multi-layered commentary on capitalism. Where the film may loose some viewers is in its tonal juggling and in a particular character. Firstly the films tonal sifts are elliptical to say the least, transitioning between outdoor adventure scenes, to low key drama, to high octane madcap chases, to blistering satire, to emotionally grueling drama, and at one point between heart wrenching thought provoking drama to slapstick comedy within the same scene. Secondly Jake Gyllenhaal's performance, as an unstable zoologist/television personality with a sweet tooth for booze, (To put it mildly) is turned up to eleven in terms of emotions, mannerisms, and delivery. Your reaction to this character might depend upon your sensibilities. I've read several reviews that describe his character as grating and unintentionally annoying, but I personally found him to be alternately hilarious and pitiful. These factors might be a turnoff to some of you, but to those who are sick of the overly processed assembly line films that infest our modern multiplexes, Okja isn't so much a substitute so much as a revelation, that big budgeted auteur driven films are still plausible, and that films can entertain us while still conveying a nuanced message. I can't recommend Okja enough, see it, and even if you find yourself disappointed or baffled, at least consider that it's something different from the over processed soulless films that plague American Movie theaters at the moment.",Okja

Now the plot is 100% predictable from the very beginning of the movie. You can even predict what would happen in the sequel of it if it's ever made. If there is any value of this movie, it's bringing attention to the animal fate in our world.. and maybe doubtful BIO/GMO-Free food marketing line of some corporations, but that's it.

It's also way darker, wich can be a problem to some people, specially considering one specific scene, but if you can get past that, you'll enjoy it.The characters are surprisingly good, specially the villains, wich were very entertaining to see.The humour was pretty good, although a bit cheesy at times.The CGI does it job pretty well, but there's a certain character I wish we had seen at more detail.And the action scenes...

208,RoidDroidVoid,Amazing!,10,28 June 2017,"Bong Joon-ho has brought us yet another masterpiece. Before viewing Okja, I was a little concerned that it would be just a sappy feel good family film about a kid that developed too much of an attachment to a farm animal. Now, I'm simply amazed at how Bong manages to always give us such emotionally and politically complicated films.If you understand his style and knack for subtle commentary, then you will see this as another excellent film in the same vein as The Host.The obvious commentary is clear but not overwhelming and the subtle bits are in true Bong style. I think many may misinterpret some of his choices, particularly with Gyllenhaal's character and performance, but if you grasp Bong's social and political stances then you'll appreciate the choices.For anyone who is unaware, all of Bong's movies contain certain elements. There are the overt elements that include humor (sometimes within the least humorous of situations), suspense, emotional connection, the folly of man and a lack of responsibility on the part of a government or corporation. But these elements are supported by subtle inclusions which are dotted throughout his movies like little watermarks and always serve to say the things that should be said without saying them.Besides these factors, and for those less inclined towards analytical movie watching, there is always a great story and magnificent cinematography. Okja is no exception.The only disappointing aspect of this movie is that it just came out, I've already watched it and now I'll have to wait another 2-3 years for another Bong movie to enjoy. I have seen The Host at least 10 times and I could watch it again right now. I'm certain to see Okja at least two more times with those with whom I enjoy seeing his movies and I don't think it'll feel like a chore either. In my opinion, Bong is one of the most consistent filmmakers to have ever made a movie and that streak remains unbroken with Okja.",Okja

I thought it was just a Greens propaganda to turn everyone off eating adorable super Babe. There was a huge potential though had the film not been made so chee-silly. The production company obviously had big enough budget to rope-in big name actors who didn't mind having this crap on their resumé as long as they get paid handsomely. It was cringe-worthy watching them over-acting while delivering their lines (especially Jake Gyllenhaal). A few queries that I thought made this film not worthy of anyone's time:– Paul Dano's character Jay smashes K's face and kicking him while he was down for lying. A characteristic of an evil lord from James Bond, not by a Green's Animal Rights protest leader. I was waiting for this character to develop and show more of his real colour (Green?) but in the end he was actually a good guy. I was a little confused.– Okja being the winner of the Super Pig competition for her size was forcibly mated by an equally large if not bigger male pig to produce more of their kind.– Okja being the winner of the Superpig competition still ends up at the slaughter house about to get turned into delicious sausages. What happened to giving birth to more Superpigs?– Many scenes of chasing an oversized truck with Okja in it and magically outrun the authorities.– Mija traded her small golden pig for Okja's release to Lucy Mirando. How did she get back home to Korea with Superpig? And with newly orphaned Superpiglet?– The soundtrack on some scenes were just out of place and trying too hard to be arty.– And a whole lot more...This can be forgiven if this was meant to be a comedy and with purely Asian actors (no offence). But it does not deserve the kind of attention it's getting. I expected more, way more. The CGI was good though that's why I gave it 2 rating. Did I mention how awful Jake Gyllenhaal was?",Okja

The use of the F-bomb, which was totally unnecessary to the plot and/or message of the film, and the violence makes this film unacceptable for children.

The story shows how we as human tries to change things to the better but at our animals cost. Bigger, better and fast growing creatures. It also shows our handling of the creatures, how they are cramped up in small spaces, confused, afraid and also helpless.

The story and plot of this film are not very original however, Bong is able to bring a style and direction to this film which is unmatched by most filmmakers working today. He creates interesting characters with unique backstories. Gyllenhaal's character, being a washed up wildlife show host, and Tilda Swinton's character, being some sort of spoiled rich girl who's enveloped by the illusion of power, are my two favorite.The film maintains a fast pace and even the most ansty of viewers will remain glued to their seats. Just like Bong's recent academy-award winning film, Parasite, I think anyone can find something to enjoy in Okja. The film is also beautiful. Okja has a 50 million dollar budget but it looks like a 200 million dollar movie. The CGI on Okja herself looks quite realistic and there are great set-pieces for large action scenes.My biggest issue with the film is its familiarity. I've seen this story told so many times but Bong is able to bring something different to a very typical save the animals kinda film. Okja does not compare to Bong's foreign language films but it's definitely a great, crowd-pleasing movie and its one of my favorite movies of 2017.",Okja

When a young farmer girl is separated from her pet pig, she is determined to get her back and does so through the help of activists, who have their own motives at heart. The film also depicts the heavy handedness of corporations in clamping down dissent through the forceful use of police action and their arrogant attitudes towards the rest of society. While some of the performances by Jake Gyllenhaal as the animal doctor and Tilda Swinton as CEO seem like caricatures, others are more grounded and authentic like Paul Dano's Jay who is an ideological crusader.

Okja, the CGI character, is marvelously executed, and feels the most alive of the entire cast.The bad: This script needed a few more passes — and a harsher editor — before it went into production.The movie aims to be a sharp satire of corporate greed and gung-ho animal rights activism, but its satirical knife is dull. It has nothing perceptive or unexpected to say about any of its characters, and little wit to say it with.Satirizing the amoral executives should be like shooting fish in a barrel, but their dialogue sounds like a 14 year old's idea of corporate-speak. Satirizing the gonzo animal rights activists should likewise yield some loving farce, but the movie is so thoroughly of their party it finds itself unable to laugh at them for long and instead meanders into hagiography.Good satire comes with an ""aha"" moment, when in the midst of laughter we find ourselves face to face something surprising and uncomfortable, but so viscerally true it is undeniable. This movie does not have that. All of its shots at uncomfortable truth feel familiar, and tired. Both its thin humor and its disturbing visuals are built of tropes, not insights.The two wonderful main characters can't save this film. Its final destination is ham-handed vegan propaganda, with neither the levity nor the surprise to make that propaganda hit home for anyone who doesn't already subscribe to it.Which is a shame: the movie is reaching for hard truths about greed, food production, and the harm people do by forcibly imposing their moral compass on others.

Ironic that in a few years Tom, Crow, Gypsy and Joel will greatly improve this movie; I recommend you wait till then to watch it. When you do watch it prepare to completely eliminate your disbelief; suspending it will be insufficient. The director would have us believe that a billion dollar multinational corporation would spend millions (billions) to develop a new species of swine . . . and then turn it over to a toddler in South Korea for ten years to finish the project. But of course they are greatly interested in the dietary needs of this new animal as well as its health and well being so they can maximize profits. That's why they check in every decade or so to pickup the data the youngster has collected. Oops, forgot to ask her to record its diet and related info. Well so much for husbandry. Fortunately the young lady lives on a farm so she's learned that you don't name animals destined for the abattoir. They aren't pets and you don't think of them that way. Oops, she didn't learn any of that. Well I guess Korean farmers are different. It would seem that Korean farmers like to get to know their animals, teach them tricks, even share a bed with them.

And the acting is sublime: Ahn Seo-hyun, who plays the protagonist, and Paul Dano should be nominated for awards. (FYI, Tilda Swinton and Jake Gyllenhaal's animated performances, panned by some of the reviewers here as over-the-top annoyance, were intentional, to parody the ridiculousness of corporate world and the phonies who inhabit that space.)

The roller-coaster of feelings and mood is uncomfortable at first, till you get the unique ambiance of this picture. I've been always feel for animals and have a pet almost all my life, right now my cat is my daughter (not like my daughter) she is my daughter, and doesn't matter cat, dog, bird ... But meanwhile I've been eating meat all my life, can't leave without it. Don't know what is it about ""Okja"", but I cried like never before. Since I hate saying something that I can't keep, I'm not going to say I'm a vegetarian from this moment. But I say I am really in trouble and will seriously think it over. We, without a doubt, are the worst creatures that have walked on this planet, and we are getting poor on any given aspect... I can't imagine this planet in 100 years from now, but I'm glad that I won't be seeing that picture.",Okja

The movie was also riddled with what can only be described as pure ""cheesiness"". It spends way too long at the start of the film panning in on the little girl and her animals friendship and has many sickening scenes throughout using cheap emotion to draw the audience in. Lastly, I hated the main character with a passion.

255,speakingthequeens,"Bold, Brilliant, and might just turn you Vegan",9,28 June 2017,"Bong Joon Ho is without a doubt one of the top five or ten working directors today. When it comes to juggling genre and tone almost no one is his equal. With an all-star international cast and its production by Netflix, this may be his most accessible movie yet; however, it may also be his most bizarre. It's the kind of movie that will leave you laughing one minute, crying the next, and then raising your eyebrows the next. It's so refreshing to see a film not conform to easy plot points and pandering like this film could have done so many times. Rather it takes tonal and story risks that consistently pay off. It helps that it maintains a solid satirical tone throughout allowing even the dysfunctional and reprehensible characters to remain interesting and some even likable. The actors are all terrific, particularly Ahn Seo Hung in her film debut. She keeps the emotional component grounded throughout the film and provides the most resonating moments. The only performer who may not resonate with everyone is Jake Gyllenhaal. Gyllenhaal goes all out insane for his role and while I enjoyed the lunacy, many will not be fans. My only complaint was that some of the scenes with Tilda Swinton descended into too much exposition which hinders some of the pacing. Despite the familiarity of the story, it will consistently sneak up on you with wonderful unexpected moments. Its another example of the daring and beautiful films coming from Korea, the best country for cinema in the past decade. If studios don't want to lose out to Netflix, they need to be willing to back the same kind of talent and allow for the same kind of artistic freedom.Pro-tip: Watch past the end credits",Okja

I am divided on whether movie-theaters should continue to live on, or if they should go away which we certainly have the resources for these days. And I think movie theaters are absolutely ideal for screenings, and it would be sad to see them go, but that being said; in the midst of all the TV-fatigue and all the binge-watching, it was down right heart-warming seeing a good original Netflix movie. If movie-theaters are going to shut down to save the film-industry from an overflow of TV, then so be it. This is why Okja could be a turning point. This movie lives up to its task, which is being a great pioneer in a rocky space. The usage of both English and Korean makes for great audience accessibility, which is something a Netflix movie is pretty dependent on, being a global platform. At the same time though, it pulls no punches when it comes to the food-industry. It's funny how there are a lot of crucial business aspects surrounding this movie in real life, and at the same time it's a business themed movie. The visual effects are amazing and realistic, even if there are a few moments with the super pig that look considerably cartoonish. Director Joon-Ho Bong should direct a live-action Pokémon movie, accompanied by the same VFX team of course.There's a moment, a single frame in the epilogue where (and this is no spoiler) I said ""please end there"", and it does.

Digging deeper, however, is an emotional and insightful revelation about the livestock industry. Although there are dark themes of greed and murder, there is a quaintness which keeps the film intriguing instead of overbearing, possibly in the exaggerated characters or the slow-motion scenes. Okja and Mija are lovable and everyone, with or without experience in loving animals would find their friendship endearing and their journey touching. Even beyond their friendship, however, is a prominent message about the livestock industry as we witness the transformation of the free-spirited Okja and Mija in NYC.

270,tuggyb,Wildly Inconsistent but Bold and Often Very Enjoyable,6,23 June 2017,"Bong Joon Ho's follow-up to future cult classic Snowpiercer is part sentimental childhood adventure, part hardcore animal activism movie and part surreal R-rated dark comedy. Without giving anything away, the first two parts work much better than the third, frustratingly so.Seo-Hyun Ahn is wonderful as Mija, Okja's loving companion, and the first 30 minutes or so that focuses on their relationship is the strongest material here.Unfortunately, the other performances are all over the map. Jake Gyllenhaal gives a career-worst performance as a ""wacky"", perpetually drunk, borderline psychotic television host, and he alternates between channeling Jerry Lewis at a 10 and what I can only assume is one of the prisoners from Silence of the Lambs. It absolutely doesn't work at all, comedically or narratively, and he is the very, very, very low point of an otherwise enjoyable ride, completely at odds with the rest of the film. How the studio, filmmakers or actors watched this excruciatingly cartoonish performance and found it remotely acceptable is staggering, but it's a Razzie slam-dunk if I've ever seen one and it severely detracts from the overall experience.The surreal, eccentric subplot about Tilda Swinton's character and her corporate empire fares slightly better in that it is never cringe-inducing, but still feels at odds with the tone of the Okja-Mija relationship, which is perhaps the only part of the story played relatively straight, for the better. The film doesn't dance around its unsubtle messages about animals, factory farming and GM foods, to say the least. Some might be taken aback or even appalled at the unapologetic hardcore animal liberation themes, which include graphic, uncomfortable scenes of sadistic animal abuse, and even holocaust allusions. Holocaust allusions in a kid's adventure movie, you say? Welcome to Okja. Did I mention the film is rated R?Still, if you can be forgiving of some truly curious decisions about tone and plotting, you'll probably enjoy Okja - the best parts of the film, like the heartfelt Okja-Mija relationship and a handful of riveting, beautifully put together action sequences, are so good that it makes the less successful choices more palatable. As of now I'd give it a 6.5 or so, but editing out Jake Gyllenhaal's atrocious performance would automatically bump it up a whole number.",Okja

It is a cultural contrast as well as a social commentary on the all American way of greed is good and the truth is whatever the men with the deepest pockets say it is. Maybe these lampoons ARE how quieter cultures see Americans? And there are no pretty platitudes to tie it up. We are left feeling helpless, hopeless and not at all happily ever after.

It starts light-hearted and funny at some points, however the further the movie progresses the more serious and realistic it becomes. It is an illustration of our current society and the mass production and consumption we live in. It has been a while since I cried this hard at the end of a movie. However, instead of feeling helpless cause there is so little one can do, this movie convinces you to be more conscious regarding purchases (and what you eat).Some reviews state that it is totally unrealistic that an animal (superpig in this case) can cry or wave good-bye, but, I am sorry, YOU HAVE TOTALLY MISSED THE POINT OF THIS MOVIE. And the message of the movie in my opinion is not that everybody needs to become vegetarian or vegan but to raise awareness and consciousness! and if we all consume a little less, it will make a HUGE difference in quantity and quality!! And regardless, animals (most definitely pigs, since they are actually really smart) feel anxiety and pain just as comfort and peace. anyways; if it were up to me this movie would be obligatory in all high schools (it is all about education).",Okja

284,maureennegrete,An inquiry into the human condition,10,22 September 2019,"When this movie came out I had my doubts, I mean, a movie about everything wrong about the food industry? I'd rather watch a documentary then.
But then it started having so many good reviews that I realized I might as well just give it a try, and well, here I am writing a 10/10 review right?Yes, the main plot is the food industry and animal abuse, but as the film went by I was able to distinguish some common denominator within the characters.
As we may all know, movies tend to separate their characters into categories; be it good and bad or right and wrong or simply two opposites.
As I watched the movie my brain automatically put the company manager and pretty much everyone involved with the mirando corporation into the 'bad' category and the girl within the animal activists into the 'good' category. But that's what's great about this movie, I was surprised by the fact that each character did some things 'right' and some things 'wrong' because that's the point; We are all human and we are trying our best (at least most of us) and nothing is just black and white, good and bad.
See for example, the leader of the activists claimed that he 'would never hurt a living being' and just about two days after he would find himself hitting a teammate for a mistake he make. Or Lucy Mirando who I believe had good intentions when she took her father's place because he did bad to the company, the people and the animals too. Even the girl when okja was taken away she immersed herself so bad into getting Okja back that she forgot about her grandpa, being very rude and mean to him (Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying she shouldn't have gone to rescue okja, just that she treated her grandpa very bad considering everything he had done for her).In conclusion, we could enlist 'pros' and 'contras' about pretty much every character and you can not always do that. It's immersive and somewhat confusing but that's cool, makes you think.
I feel like it could have been about any topic really, but to make it about the food industry was a great call.

289,pedrohenriquerezende,Astonishing,9,14 August 2020,"Okja is a 2017 South Korean-American film directed by Bong Joon-ho, literally a breathtaking movie! I have never felt the same feeling that I've had watching this movie before. It did catch my attention a lot, I couldn't stop watching it, my eyes were always attached to the screen making me interested in the content that it has to offer , well to put in other words, an emotional roller coaster. This is the kind of movie that will make you laugh at one minute, cry the next few ones, and then raise your eyebrows. If I could describe all of the movie in one single phrase it would be eye opening to be real honest. It's very simple messaging but is nevertheless beautiful, it opens your eyes for the real world and it reminds you of what's going on outside. The movie is not an anti-meat film or ""movement, protest"" that will make you instantly stop eating something, despite some of the plot points presented to show how meat is prepared and delivered to the supermarkets.Okja was filmed in South Korea, but most of its scenes are based at the United States, featuring a young South Korean girl, Okja is an giant animal, more of like a giant pig which follows and keeps up with the girl throughout the entire movie, there both real close ""friends"", the little girl turns out to have a real deep affection with the animal. As the story develops itself several things are happening involving the two main characters, causing them to mess with our psychology ,making you more and more interested at the bizarre, funny and sad moments.The film has an excellent performance from every single character who keeps you questioning what will happen for the next scenes . The visual, 3D elements that make this ""enormous pig"" and other props are amazing. However there are some parts of the movie that may be too heavy or contain sensitive parts for some types people, especially children, which is why the movie has an +14 restriction, but if you're that one kind of person which doesn't care about certain scenes like me, your not going to be bothered as much as a sensitive person would be indeed.I feel like the movie is too ""compact"" for itself and not well developed with much details of the situations that are happening at certain times, I atleast expect to have a second movie, clarifying more events. The movie is so interesting that it makes you wanna learn more about it, wonder and worry about the characters, cause there's literally so much going on, that you can't follow everything at once. The only complaint that I have about this movie is that it's too short for a well produced film like that, it should definitely have a part 2.A well executed work will always catch people's attention, I wish that everybody could see at least once. The message that it passed for me on my point of view was that no matter what ,you have to always stick together with the other ,show some love, respect and affection to the ones you love and know. This movie is a good representation of how the feeling of care for somebody works, I would for sure recommend this movie to anyone. If you're bored and looking for something to watch on Netflix, why wouldn't you just see it and give it a try? it's so for certain worth watching one of my favourite movies.",Okja
290,xinoehp,Not enjoyable.,3,27 September 2020,"I'm not sure what I thought this movie was going to be. I don't usually read reviews because I like to make an independent assessment, and clearly the bizarre overabundance of positive reviews on this site wouldn't have helped. They're as at odds with the movie as the movie is with itself, creating a very jarring experience.The movie starts out ok, and you experience the idyllic world of the little girl and okja the super pig. But it rapidly devolves into a strange mixture of tones that leave you puzzled and not quite sure where the movie is going or whether it's supposed to be serious (and doing so badly) or humorous (and completely missing the mark). There's at least one assistant, for example, who has this terrible chipmunk-like voice, and you just don't know if it's intentional humor or just a very bad ... dub? Dialogue is generally terrible, and doesn't help you to identify with our sympathize with any of the characters.I usually commit to watching a movie entirely through, but when the show portrayed the mating between okja and a male super pig as brutality (seriously? It's a natural animal function. Why is this even in the show?), that was the beginning of the end for me. When the movie continued with needless abuse, I realized I hadn't actually enjoyed anything about the movie, for over half the length, and I wasn't interested in subjecting myself to more. I shut it off.I still don't know if the movie is against the concept of meat, or GMOs, or what. The entire premise behind the super pigs is a more environmently conscious way of feeding the world, which is supposed to be a good thing. The clumsy ""free all animals"" group boasts how they free animals from zoos, which (unless it was intended as humor or irony? I couldn't tell) is moronic because zoos play a critical role in education and protection of species. So if the movie intended slamming zoos, that speaks to how uneducated the filmmakers are. Either way, this group is portrayed as the bizarre heroes of the film ... I can only hope the contradictions are intentional. Maybe the message is that even idiots get lucky and can do a good deed for a little girl.At the end of the day, I have no problem eating bacon or steak, or any other form of meat. I would also like my entertainment to be enjoyable, not leave me on the slightly sick Twilight Zone side of emotionless. And that's slightly sick because I prefer understanding the emotional reaction I'm supposed to have, rather than being jerked around by the bizarre tone of the movie. I also simply don't care for the portrayal of an imaginary creature as intelligent, yet childlike, and then suffering rape and abuse. No thanks. If you want to make your animal rights message (this movie isn't it), do it in a more effective way.",Okja
291,phill_salzburg,KZ Pigs without emotion and Kapitalist farmers,4,28 June 2017,"I don't know where to start!? tltr; not worth watching.So, it's a typical story about a child and her best friend a pig.You're shown their everyday life, they get separated, child has adventure, they rejoin and in the end everything is as before but different. But although there are enjoyable action scenes in this film, it lacks all emotion.For example at one point Okja (pig) rescues Mija (child) from falling of a cliff to certain death and you hear not so much as a tiny scream coming from either the child nor the animal but cold mathematical thinking from both. And it's not just those two it's the majority of characters most often caring more about money than their own family making the pigs more human than a lot of the cast. Yes, this is definitely supposed to but it makes the whole film tedious to watch. Also there is a scene in which animals getting their baby rescued before they get slaughtered in an concentration campesque environment which really is just for effects, reminding me of the CoD:MW2 Airport level.Charakterwise Okja leans heavily on Hunger Games which is nothing new but works quite well, oh and I liked the peaceful terrorists and many other strange side characters which made the world believable. Those characters stories get far too less screen play e.g. there is a whole subplot about this, I guess butler? who's always in the back playing the corporate bosses against each other but whose agenda isn't revealed. This film has just so many design flaws making me a couple of times think: ""I could've directed that better"" and I never held a camera. Example: Mija is running after the kidnapped Okja who's brought to Seoul. The whole scene is very dramatic as there is no time to wast because Okja's plane to NY starts tomorrow. Midway Mija is turning back after having spent several hours chasing Okja on foot, we know this because it's night when she comes home, just to spend mere minutes taking a golden pig jewelry which she was given a few scenes earlier. Why couldn't she just take the damn thing with her in the first place? And there are couple of similar examples throughout the film.In the end Okja just doesn't work for me. (4/10)",Okja

I have a feeling the rating is only so high because if you don't like this movie you hate animals. It's not true. This is a bad movie.**SPOILS** One thing I really don't get is the bad guy, in the end, giving the girl her pig for money. No way her genetically mutated pig is worth less than that small gold statue. Given that THEY refused to sell them to anyone and only rented them out but in the end, she decides it's OK to just sell the animal? I MEAN none of this would have happened. You can't just say ""company"" doesn't want to sell the pig only wants to rent them but in the end, the company now does want to sell the pig. It is just so stupid. This whole story is so flustered with issues. Like the ""ALF"" they needed to make some high-tech device to sneak in using this girls 'pig' but near the end, they walk right in. No guards and the door wasn't even locked you're telling me that they have this much trouble getting into these guys buildings when a little girl managed to do it with little to no effort.

It surely doesn't deserve it.Terrible acting from almost everyone involved, except from Steven Yeun (the few scenes where he appears). One of my favorite actors, Jake Gyllenhaal, totally disappointed me with his performance; his character doesn't even know what he's up to. Tilda Swinton was bad, but when her character's evil twin shows up maaan, it gets even worst. A totally unnecessary movie twist. And Paul Dano I don't even want to talk about him.The movie begins with a good pace, the Korea part is good and enjoyable, but after that it just demolish itself. Zero credibility for the majority of things that happen in the middle and a very disappointing end. The only thing that made me rate this movie with 5 stars (that, for me, means below the watchable bar) is the pig Okja itself, with her kindness, intelligence and personality that made my interest not to totally turn off.P.S. I pity those that, because of this movie, suddenly realized that stock animals suffer a lot before they get into our tables, how innocent fellas you are to think that they give us their flesh willingly.

About half way through it, I considered turning it off. This idea had so much potential to be an incredible film, but there are simply too many elements that dragged it down to below average. I found myself cringing at the over dramatic dialogue, especially at that of Jake Gyllenhaal, who I'd previously considered one of my favorite actors.

310,bugnon-sebastien,"Okja, a pro-vegan movie ?",7,18 September 2017,"In the misty mountains of South Korea, Mija and her grandfather live alongside a huge and mysterious animal called Okja. Meanwhile in NewYork city, Lucy Mirando becomes CEO of the Mirando Corporation that aims at producing a new breed of ""superpigs, massive, mutant-like pigs designed to taste f***** good"". Mija's life shifts when the American multinational captures her best friend Okja to bring him back to New-York where Mrs. Mirando has huge projects for him Without any strategy, Mija sets up a rescue mission to save her friend Okja. On her way she will meet capitalists and consumers committed to take over Okja's destiny while Mija strives to bring back her friend in South Korea. The very first part of the movie begins with the speech of Lucy, the new CEO of Mirando corporation. She explained that with her, the company will know a totally new area with new core values such as environmental friendliness, life and humanity. She emphasizes the fact that 805 million humans are struggling with hunger every day and that something should be done. Of course, she has the solution: raise a breed of ultimate super pig that will meet the primary needs of every single human on earth. It is interesting to note that the fictive name of the corporation ""Mirando"" is close to Mosanto, a US-based company symbol of today's industrial agriculture. A coincidence ? I don't think so Indeed, this chemical-intensive form of production pollutes the environment, accelerates biodiversity loss, and massively contributes to global warming. This link between fiction and reality brings the discussion of a current issue on the table which is factory farming, a large-scale industrial operation that houses thousands of animals raised for food and treated with hormones and antibiotics to prevent disease and maximize their growth and food output.In our capitalistic society, profit maximization has always been a key objective for CEO's. And now more than ever companies can leverage their profit thanks to globalization and improvements in ICT. One would have to be blind to not notice that several movie scenes illustrate that Mirando Corporation is all about money. For instance, you can notice the corporate attitude towards consumers when Lucy says: ""If it's cheap and tasty, they'll eat it"" or ""It is all edible except for the squeal"" or even ""We can only sell the dead ones, living animals are not profitable"". The most meaningful part of the movie that shows that Mirando has no ethics is the one when Mija tried to clinch a deal with Lucy to get back Okja. Indeed, the CEO only saw a more profitable transaction and didn't care at all about the feelings of the little girl. Furthermore, the movie perfectly depicts the phenomenon of green washing commonly used by companies to pretend that they act ethically towards society, environment or even people. In Okja, the marketing department uses this technique to enhance their brand image. Indeed, they claim to be Eco-friendly, natural and be GMO free whereas it's not the case at all. This explain why the ALF (Animal Liberation Front) which is actually PETA (people for the ethical treatment of animals) protest against animals' right violation. All these protests against factory farming raise the following question: ""Do people should drastically lower their meat consumption?"". Regarding this issue, I share the same opinion of Bong Joon-ho, the movie director. According to him if we change the way we consume, companies will have to adapt to the demand and the new consumption patterns. To cut a long story short Okja is not a pro-vegan movie, I would rather say that the filmmaker wanted to satirize the current society and especially draw an image of our global way of thinking that not sustainable in the long term. Mass production on behave of profit maximization should be considered as an out-of-date system to make room for local production based on the demand.",Okja
311,burkart-peter,Not for me,2,8 August 2017,"When I saw the cute little pig thing displayed on the Netflix screen, I thought that I would give this one a try. I read all of the rave reviews, I've seen a few movies from the director, and thought why not. Then I watched it, and I figured out very quickly why not. Now, it's fair to point out that I'm not a vegan, I enjoy eating meat, and I'm very aware of what goes on inside a slaughterhouse. And, trust me, if you thought what was depicted on screen was vicious, you should check out you should check out something besides a work of fiction.I think what really bothered me, besides the need to make genetically modified food ""adorable"", was the scene where the ALF leader beat the living tar out of the tech guy for lying. I didn't understand the ""aw those poor animals"" attitude, and then a ""let's beat up people"" attack on the public. I didn't like the way an F bomb was dropped every time someone ate meat, and I really didn't like how kid friendly the pigs were and how non-kid friendly the dialogue was.I guess if this compelled one to stop eating meat, then I'd be glad that it made such an impression, but I guess then one would have to take in to consideration all the human cruelty that takes place on vegetable farms, all the underpaid brewers that clean beer barrels with corrosive chemicals, even all the chemicals that go in to flash freezing french fries, the world is a horrible place, and I saw this movie as pure, one sided propaganda.",Okja

Makes one think about how we treat our animals, especially the bulk livestock necessary for feeding the few billion still carnivorous humans. The movie's preview picture looks like a cute comic / is a hand-drawn pig (at least on a popular streaming service I use it is — Here it's a pig with factory chimneys coming out of its back, much darker than the pink piglet I originally saw for the thumbnail).Based on the above detailed misrepresentation, I thought this'd be an animated movie or cartoon and was even pleasantly surprised by the giant CGI super-pig perfectly blended with the lush forest scenery. Beautiful. After previewing the first thirty or so minutes and quickly checking the ending (both very cute and happy), I decided the 16+ age rating was a silly oversight and allowed a 7 years old kid to watch with me. But boy was I wrong! Parents beware: the beginning cutesy Japanese part is later replaced with the reveal of(Mild spoiler warning) USA. Corruption, careerism, competition, animal abuse, insults, threats, GMO involvement and many more pigs (one giant is cute, but a thousand, with various bloody mutations on the other hand, is quite unsettling), there's also an industrialized slaughterhouse shown in graphic detail, carnage included (dissection of pig carcasses, including execution and beheading by machine). Before that some car chases, continued pursuit on foot through a shopping mall with plenty of ""destruction by pig"", nonviolent shooting (tranquilizer darts only), etc.(Spoilers have ended)Not an accident this was rated 16 and up, after all. Sorry kid! You're traumatized for life, probably. But thankfully the children I know are all mature for their age and since I was there, we talked through the bad parts. It is two days later now, and the kid still eats meat without complaint or a feeling of guilt, but now has some pretty compelling arguments for later switching to vegetarianism.""Yes, you are eating something like Okja (our GMO pigs are a bit smaller though) from a death factory very similar in its machinery and cruelty to what we saw in the bad movie."" was a sentence I remember saying.

318,alessandrodioguardifilm,Freedom for Okja! Let it run to the theater!,8,15 October 2017,"Okja was the epicenter of the major discussion around Cannes Film Festival 70, overshadowing the Palme d'Or winner - despite my interest for the kermesse I had to check on Wikipedia. The movie, written and directed by Bong Joon-ho and produced by Netflix, raised the question: is it right to have a movie without any theater distribution in a Festival that promotes Cinema? Maybe yes, maybe no, it's not the focus of this article. Okja, without any doubt, it's a must see that hides, in his production, some great step forward for western cinema and a big misstep.The movie is powerful, graceful, funny, a perfect way to bring on screen a delicate topic such as the animal abuse and the intensive livestock farming. Characters like animal rights activist and corporate weirdo are described with their peculiar idiosyncrasies, melted in a fast pacing action. This is the typical Asian storytelling that I love. Okja has a mise en scene that all the kids who grew up with manga, anime, Korean and Chinese cinema, not to mention the Studio Ghibli's animation, will be happy to watch and would easily recognize.It's a production miracle see an American production company and distributor, produce this script. It's a production miracle see actors like Jake Gyllenhaal and Tilda Swinton put such a big and remarkable effort to bring to life those characters. In Okja, like in Studio Ghibli's stories, kids and over the top outcast, in contradiction with their own credo, are the good guys. It's a formula that most of the big studios would have rejected or controlled with a closed eye in order to turn it into a cheesier version of E.T., just to minimize the risk of a big flop avoiding to bring to the audience a story out of the usual structure. The last miracle is having this movie accepted to such a big festival as Cannes.At this point, we have to talk about the dark side of the moon. Yes, ladies and gentleman, Netflix is the moon, but with a cold and hidden face that, thanks to this production, has been revealed to the world. A movie like Okja, so well written and directed, with a great message behind and a catching storytelling, deserved a theater distribution and a better advertising campaign. The movie has to face the oblivion of Netflix digital catalog and the strong idea, radicated in his consumers, that the platform is a binge-watching machine for TV series. Okja, after so many discussions about the theater distribution, ironically, disappeared in a Limbo. Had a decent advertisement coverage but not enough to match the impact of having a big audience in a theater, in silence, enjoying the movie and being blown away by the spot-on effort made by Bong Joon-ho and his cast.50 million dollars invested in a bold, different, project that most of the audience will forget in a digital playlist of favorites - do not forget all the people who do not have Netflix and are not willing of subscribing anytime soon. A movie that becomes the talk of the town for a while and for the wrong reason, that can be watched whenever you like but not now, maybe later, last season of The Defender is on.If major invested money to bring ""The Mummy"" to the theater, why not make the effort to bring a masterpiece like Okja, an adventure for kids and adult, to the theater?

325,chrisbianchi-73703,"Cute Movie, but Some Flaws",5,1 July 2017,"I stumbled on this on a Saturday morning while I was looking for something different to watch. I found it.The concept is intriguing. A cartoonish depiction of an ""evil GMO"" corporation raised some kind of mutant pig, cloned it, and sent it around the world to be raised for 10 years then to collect as slaughter. A girl gets overly attached to her livestock and has to be taught an unnecessarily difficult life lesson (e.g. ""don't get attached to livestock as a farmer""). I say unnecessarily difficult as experienced farmers know better than to get attached to livestock. They're business inventory, not pets. So when the corporation comes to collect, she goes on an ""adventure"" to steal the pig thing.I'm not a fan of having to read half of my movies - especially when I'm trying to do other work simultaneously and there are lots of subtitles and Korean language, so be prepared for that.It's a cute movie if you can get over the anti-GMO/political junk. Definitely not going to stop me from eating bacon as some have mentioned, mostly because I can see past the PeTA-esque leaning of the film and see it for what it really is: a kid got too attached to a farm animal and got dangerously upset when it was going to be slaughtered.

329,squeakeeden,i like it but..,9,2 July 2017,"Hats off to the director for creating a movie that is an eye-opener to most people. the movie made me cry and a guilty for consuming meat from factory farms. what they showed in the movie is just the tip of the iceberg of what really goes on in slaughterhouses. they have delivered a powerful message about compassion, corporate greed and lies, activism, and animal rights. Though it is only a movie, it is not far from the truth. (as a side note, this got me thinking that somewhere right now, an animal is being slaughtered inhumanely).I rated it 9/10 because I learned something from the movie that will benefit me and the animals surrounding me and 9/10 because disliked how Jake and Tilda performed in the movie - i don't know, something was off.",Okja
330,mkostic-57543,OK Movie...wrong direction of what movies should be...,2,3 July 2017,"Good concept, decent timing (given our time in history dealing with harvesting animals and breading them), but trying to make this ""real"" just makes it worse...This would be an 8 (possibly up to 10) if completely animated...this is CALLING to be a Disney/Pixar film...the idea of creating this as a fictional, ""real-life"" story makes no sense...the animal CGI doesn't fit, the acting is compromised because of it, and it just feels forced, overall.Also, maybe don't have the actor from ""Gone Girl"" that chokes a puppy be an animal activist now, kinda weird (nothing against him personally, just odd since you can recognize him before he takes his face-mask off and type-cast in ""bad-guy"" role).If re-made properly, would consider watching, otherwise, waste of story and time in my opinion. Cheers,-MK",Okja
331,mcdrakehk,"Good flick, but cruel morals and deception underlie this film by Boon",6,4 July 2017,"Okja continues Netflix's foray into Hollywood film-making. In this reviewer's opinion, Okja is morally flawed. The year is 2007, and the world is ""in need of a miracle."" Tilda Swinton, who fabulously plays the Mirando corporation's CEO, makes a dazzling entrance at a press gathering in her father's defunct factory. The cinematography here absolutely shines. There, she unveils the company's newest revelation, the ""SuperPig"", one so large it needs an 18-wheeler to transport; 26 will be sent around the world.10 years later, we see Mija, in care with her grandfather, spending long, languorous afternoons bonding with this incredible creature (pet?) Okja, who's now grown and full-size. We see her slink away to cuddle with her at night; in another scene, she's brushing his teeth (inside his mouth, no less!) and looking like a half-eaten kiddo. -Not just your average pig-Okja shows her uniqueness. Not only does she – ostensibly - understand Korean, he realizes something no animals beyond humans do – future-thinking and self-sacrifice. Plots need to move along, and trouble starts brewing – both logistical and moral. The 10-years have come to an end, and that means Okja's due for a visit. Johnny Willcox (well-played by Jake Gyllenhaal), an animal-loving TV-personality and 'face' of the project, arrives with his crew and sizes up the beast, cameras in tow. Mija is none the wiser, considering this a routine visit; in reality, she's about to lose her best life friend. Before, her grandfather assured her over dinner that he had paid Mirando to keep Okja around and off the chopping block. (And then cowardly turned his attention to a broken TV set.) As the crew arrives, he scurries her off to her mother's and father's grave site. You can tell how the rest goes. This is one of the first disappointing notes in the movie – the grandfather's betrayal of daughter. He later reveals his true interest - she go into the city, live normally, and meet a potential mate, not ""roll around with pigs all day"". Here, we see him care for her future and development, but his lying to his own granddaughter is something some film-goers may overlook due to its practicality, but shouldn't. Worse, he handles the affair without dignity – dragging Mija to the grave so he may scold her when she (understandably!) screams in anger, ""talking"" to her now-passed parents. -Capture-Okja is taken away, and we're led on a chase by Mija through Korea. She eventually finds Okja, clambering onto her captors' truck. Here we meet the Animal Liberation Front, a fun set of vigilantes led by Jay (Paul Dano). He and his team pull up adjacent to Okja's trailer and, clad in black clothes and ski masks, scream to the drivers ""we're here to help, we don't want to hurt you."" Eventually, the capture truck is sideswiped and Okja rescued. Okja is – for now – safe. When Jay (Paul Dano) and team (including K, Steven Yeun) sit down to explain their presence and the ALF's mission to Mija, Dano over-acts the expository speech with great bombast; K, the only Korean-speaker, translates judiciously, and on Paul's more outrageous lines, doesn't bother. Summing to: The ALF is against violence and is trying to free animals. Mija: ""OK, thanks for helping, give me my Okja back."" But the ALF hasn't come without an extra motive – they need Okja on one more mission before presumably re-rescuing her. The conversation ends – will Mija give her consent? K, continuing his translator role, asks. She refuses. In the heat of the moment, K announces ""she agrees"", and the group cheers.The ALF accomplishes what they set out to, but through their antics, we learn their true character. They comprise five or six animal rights activists, punk-rock looking fighters, with two of the men ostensibly in a same-sex relationship, which I'd argue is unnecessary and just adds to the film's ""hipness""; a same-sex couple or lack of couples entirely would have a net effect of zero. The ALF claims they're non-violent, but in multiple scenes the team can be seen shouting expletives (F-bombs, this film includes aplenty) and fighting back to semi-armed forces. K's mistranslation – later admitted to the team in their operations room – is followed by Jay (Dano's) brutally shoving and kicking K (while on the ground) for his betrayal, and then banishing him. In another pursuit scene, the ALF dumps hundreds of marbles on the ground toward running, incoming Mirando troops; I heard at least one or two back-breaking falls (or concussion-causing?). Non-violence?-Language and culture- The movie attempts for some laughs with cross-cultural language exchange; the hijacking ALF forces have difficulty communicating to the Korean driver from Mirando. Only K, apparently of descent, has bothered to pick up any Korean (hell, even Mija picked up a basic US English book on her way to the States). And in a cheesy moment filled with cliché, K's character eventually reveals to Jay how ""sacred"" the translations are to both him and the ALF. Really, K? Jay should learn some Korean, particularly if he's world-bound to spread the gospel. -Deception- From the first board scene, we see Nancy Mirano (Tilda Swinton) being betrayed by her own second in command, who surreptitiously slides an iPhone – clearly dialed to her twin sister and business competitor – onto a glass table. Nancy's having a breakdown and her sister is being clued in, live. Frank Dawson (Giancarlo Esposito) plays the ""right hand man"" role well, and much later joins – without flinching – the twin sister after Nancy's fall from grace. -In Sum-The third act brings resolution, but ultimately, what message was this film trying to convey? Grandfather betrays granddaughter, company betrays society via food, ALF betrays its own mission, and sister betrays sister, helped by (ostensibly) her most trusted business comrade.",Okja
332,ballantynegus,"Simple, touching but above all intelligent and relevant!",10,4 July 2017,"I decided to check out the hype about Okja - the first movie produced by Netflix. Get through the first half hour which is a bit bizarre and zany and you will experience an unforgettable and ultimately feelgood 2 hours. 2 of the best hours of your life. Okja tells a beautiful and touching story of a love between a girl and a genetically modified giant pig in South Korea and it is stunningly heartwarming. This is one of those films that has you crying with laughter (giant pig poos), it has you crying with sadness. It has you squealing (no pun intended) with excitement and has you wanting a sticky demise for the bad guys. Tilda Swinton plays twins in this and is extremely heartless and evil in both personas.. The cuter and less evil of the twins will have you thinking ""Is that Sia?""!!!You actually do start to - by the middle of the film - think about taking up vegetarianism as the giant pig is amazingly cute with an outwardly human like and fragile personality and by the first 60 minutes you actually want an Okja of your own. Every home should have mini Okja's and there could be a HUGE marketing push on merchandise if the film were geared toward children. I am in tears now after watching. It grounds the viewer and outlines the vast difference between the Eastern and the Western cultures. The Western greed vs the simplicity and humble Eastern outlook of a farmer in remote S Korea. The scene in the abattoir had me beside myself, but it is not all darkness and there is a very lovely twist in the scene. Jake Gyllenhaal as the crazily zany TV presenter and the amazingly talented young actress Seo-Hyun Anh as the ballsy, defiant, pig owning young Korean girl both steal the show. I've an even bigger crush on Jake G after seeing his versatility in this film. It was like he was channelling Jim Carrey. A MUST SEE!!!!! Netflix could soon be taking on the big studios soon with movies like this as a first attempt. My rating 11/10.",Okja

It also provided an insight into the world of animal cruelty. This movie left me mad at the world, wishing I could do more for all those animals out there. Don't get me wrong, it was an amazing movie. It left me with very strong messages and only encouraged my passionate love for animals. Do watch. It will change your entire perspective.",Okja
335,ZMmedia,So...This Is Supposed to be a Great Film? Nah.,4,8 July 2017,"I admire Korean director and filmmaker Bong Joon Ho. It's OK to have your own style, and moviegoers appreciate seeing films that offer something different, like the works of Terry Gilliam or even the Cohen Brothers. Okja is a film with many different purposes. Unfortunately, it never really gives any of these purposes the lead. They are blended into a painful two hours of clichéd characters, terrible scripting, weak social statements and constant changing tones. It's hard to really understand which part of the movie drives the narrative. One of the tones and themes of the film is that our society and its companies are vicious murderers of those poor pigs, each of which is genetically modified and then slaughtered concentration camp style for those awful human consumers. Well, this is life folks, and I promise you that a slaughterhouse is far worse than what you see on film. Is the film anti- meat, or is the meat production business just incidental to the story line? We really don't know. And, just as a side note, if our protagonists are to save the animals from human consumption, how is it that the little girl, our central character, plucks a fish out of the stream in the early part of the film and serves it for dinner? If this movie had any substance, I would have said that the fish scene was planted there for irony. But, it wasn't. As for the rest of the film, some of film's best talent were assembled to portray characters that are predictable and clichéd, and the actors were given really bad dialog. It was amateur hour throughout the film. There were no surprises, and those ""tear jerker"" moments that other reviewers keep sniffling over were barely any kind of emotional triggers. On a plus side, the CGI animal effects truly brought our pig characters to life, and the audience ""buys"" the super pig as being real. But, let's be real. Pigs, even genetically modified super pigs don't cry. They don't understand humans (this one understood both English and Korean), and they don't wave goodbye to their offspring that get saved from slaughter. Sure, you will say that the pig emotions are symbolic, however, symbolism isn't achieved by making these film pigs emotional creatures. Anyway, in the end, when I read all the rave reviews of this film, I feel like the guy at the art show staring at a white canvas that some famous artist has splashed with a brush of black paint.. The people around me marveling at how the painting represents life, the universe and everything...and all I see is a white painting with some black paint spilled on it.",Okja

338,x-13350,Groundbreaking Documentary,9,15 July 2017,"Okja is a triumph of documentary cinematography! The action shots are unprecedented for the genre and every close-up is emotionally overwhelming. The film truly shines a new light on our modern meat industry. However, I do wish the film contained maybe some asides or personal interviews with the characters to better truly understand their situation. Also the documentary's message was powerful but maybe more on-screen facts and statistics could have backed it up. Overall though I recommend Okja to anyone who wishes to learn more about Superpigs, a marvelous Chilean animal I had never even heard of before!",Okja
339,oldstephanieb,A Movie of Pure Trolling,1,16 July 2017,"This movie is just awful. It presents a nightmarish scenario based on the flimsiest of logic and relies on many very improbable elements. This movie is not quite nightmarish enough to truly be a horror flick, but is a huge, scarring bait and switch for anyone thinking it is a girl-and-her- animal-friend movie. Without any clear message or basis in reality, this movie exists to torment the characters that inhabit its universe and to troll the viewer.

When I see people reviewing this movie, mostly women without any facts just feelings, they are clueless. This was basically a leftist propaganda film painting these kind of animal movements as peaceful and capitalism as bad. Nothing to do with facts, nothing to do with science but if you can see past that, you might enjoy the movie. Just a typical modern day movie, strong female lead, males are either idiots or bad people. Too bad the real life terrorist groups are portrayed in this as righteous people.",Okja
341,urrea-74986,What a movie!,8,12 August 2017,"Okja is an emotional film that raises ethical questions and moral conflicts about food production and man's actions on nature. At the beginning the movie gives an idea that what Lucy Mirando was planning, was a project that will benefit humankind by providing high quality meat with the highest ethical standards. But, as the movie keeps going, the viewer realizes that her concern was not authentic. Her motivation was not driven by a sincere desire to help humanity, on the contrary it was driven by a selfish desire to succeed, and do better than her father and her sister. During the story, many aspects of the corporate social responsibility are raised, and they all seem to be justified by a notion like the one expressed by Milton Friedman. As he stated, the responsibilities that executives need to consider are the ones of the shareholders, and this is to make as much money as possible. This is how Nancy justifies what she does, in the name of business. Her mental structure is one that only thinks in how to make more money regardless of the many ethical and moral issues which are most of the time eluded. The relationship between Mija and Okja, is one driven by love, and as it develops throughout the movie, it gets into the viewer's heart and that is the reason why at the end, you don't know how to feel. Is a strange feeling that fits somewhere between cheerfulness because Okja and Mija are together again, and a sense of discomfort because of the other pigs fate. And adding to these feelings, there is a dilemma that stocked in my mind, and is the meat consumption. After watching this, is normal to decide cutting off meat from one's diet, because the whole situation of MC (Mirando Corporation)) is shocking and it raises so many questions. The problem here is if there is any ethic way of killing an animal for consumption purposes, one may argue that MC was doing a good job providing food to different countries, but the thing is how you provide food, which are your practices, and what do you tell to your customers confronted with reality. In these aspects is where one can argue the unethical procedures of MC, but the essence of the business which is to provide food to their customers, is hard to tumble, because even Mija and her Grandfather were meat eaters. But apart from this, is natural to eat meat, is the way the animal kingdom is set. The director does an amazing job portraying this situation, and somehow contrasts two opposite positions, one that evidences the slaughter houses, and the massive meat production, whereas the other position is portrayed with the ALF group, and some of the members who seem to be very extreme about food consumption.Presumably, the Director does this to make us aware of what is really going on with this industry, but is not a call to be vegetarian, it is a call to balance our consumption, as he shows both sides of the coin. It is a call for us to try to decrease meat consumption, and for the companies to practice a sincere social corporate responsibility by minimizing negative impacts and maximizing benefits for our society. The key aspect is to have a genuine concern over humankind, and not to have statements of corporate responsibility intended to maximize their profit while acting in discordance to those statements. There is not a magic formula, is simple, act genuinely as if you were part of human kind, consider a broader sense of what is meant to be a human being and realize that your existence is shared, by doing this we all can create a better place. One in which Kindness is the main actor.",Okja

It begins with CEO Lucy Mirando briefly explaining her mission for her company, which involves distributing twenty-six ""super piglets"" to farmers all over the world. The farmers will compete to raise the biggest and strongest super pig. In ten years, they will be revisited and the animals will be retrieved. Young Mija, now fourteen years old, is unaware that her loyal friend and companion, Okja, will be leaving her life. When she finds out, she doesn't sit still and accept the devastating news. Instead, she sets out to rescue her beloved Okja.And so begins the incredible journey.Beautiful and heartwarming, this enchanting story is a testament to the unbreakable bonds between man and beast. Mija goes to great lengths to try and save her friend. Viewers witness their incredible relationship and heart-rending separation. Action-packed and highly emotional, this movie censures corporate greed at the expense of helpless animals--though it is done in a subtle way and not at all inappropriately as a hidden agenda. Keep your tissue box handy for the ending scenes--they are gut- wrenching and distressing. These are the moments that may just turn some people into vegetarians.

However, the movie has such a predictable story line and there's one thing I don't acctually get. In the end, Nancy Mirando gives the girl her pig for money. How on earth a genetically mutated pig is worth less than that small gold statue? Given that THEY refused to sell them to anyone and only rented them out but in the end, she decides it's OK to just sell the animal. There's another thing, though: the ""ALF"" needed to make some high-tech device to sneak in using Okja but in the end, they walk right in. No guards and the door wasn't even locked and you're telling me that they have this much trouble getting into these buildings when a little girl managed to do it with little to no effort?
