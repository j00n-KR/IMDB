0,Leofwine_draca,The best Jack Ryan film out there,8,9 April 2011,"The last of Harrison Ford's outings as Jack Ryan (following PATRIOT GAMES), CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER is a classy outing that throws the star into the middle of a drugs war between Colombian cocaine barons and some highly corrupt American officials. Along the way, he must contend with an ineffectual President (THE THING's Donald Moffat), an ailing buddy (the ever excellent James Earl Jones) and a mercenary leader (the scene stealing Willem Dafoe).The movie is well shot and entertaining, never better than when detailing the cyber hijinks between Ford and corporate schmuck Henry Czerny or an excellent ambush set-piece halfway through. The first half is a little slow but things really pick up for the second, which depicts a complex situation south of the border with no less than three sides competing for dominance and Ford caught in the middle. We get a solid turn from Ford and a deliciously tough bad guy performance from Joaquim de Almeida, alongside well-shot action and a climax that doesn't hold back.",Clear and Present Danger
1,SnoopyStyle,nice mix of intrigue and action,8,2 June 2015,President Bennett's friends are murdered by Columbian Cali cartel drug lord Escobedo. He seeks revenge by declaring them Clear and Present Danger. Presidential Adviser James Cutter and Bob Ritter sends John Clark (Willem Dafoe) and his team to direct bombs on the targets. It's a secret mission that neither Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford) nor his mentor Jim Greer know about. Greer is sick with cancer. Ryan is appointed Deputy Director of Intelligence and sent down to Bogota. Meanwhile Escobedo has intelligence operative Félix Cortez who has inside info in the White House and plans of his own.It's an intriguing political espionage mixed with some well executed action scenes. The ambush in Bogota is terrific action. Joaquim de Almeida is a great villain. He has a great depth which is perfect for his double dealing. It's a well made Tom Clancy spy movie.,Clear and Present Danger
2,kosmasp,Harrison Jack Ryan Ford,7,3 July 2019,"There have been quite a few adaptations of Jack Ryan and depending on your taste you like some and you don't care for others. Harrison Ford seems a perfect fit (age group aside or at least related) to portray a ""spy"" like that. I have not read the novels the character is based on, so I can't really say how some will feel about the physicality but that is true about every actor playing the role and making an effort.This of course has a lot of politics in it. But it also is quite a thriller. You may like how it is paced or how the twists and turns happen (doesn't even really matter if you see them coming, when it comes to the entertainment factor of the movie itself), but overall the movie delivers on what is promising. Great actors assemble too, even in smaller roles",Clear and Present Danger
3,gavin6942,"Harrison Ford, the Reluctant Action Star",7,10 December 2015,"CIA Analyst Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford) is drawn into an illegal war fought by the US government against a Colombian drug cartel.James Berardinelli remarked, ""Clear and Present Danger is all plot and no characters. The people running around on screen have about as much depth as the sheen of sweat on Harrison Ford's forehead. Jack Ryan is the most disappointing of all. He's disgustingly virtuous: a flawless fighter for good and justice, a Superman without the cape. I spent half the movie wondering if this guy was ever going to show anything to mark him as vaguely human."" That just seems too harsh, and for no good reason. This is an action film, after all. Sure, we do not get the depth we might like from Jack Ryan, but we have already developed him in two prior films. This is action, a spy thriller. We need twists, turns, gunfire and explosions! (And we get them, too.)",Clear and Present Danger
4,ccthemovieman-1,A Lot More Good Than Bad,8,21 March 2006,"Harrison Ford returns as ""Jack Ryan,"" star of the very well-done ""Patriot Games,"" the film adaption off the best-selling Tom Clancy novels. Also returning are Anne Archer and James Earl Jones.THE BAD - This isn't as intense, especially in the first half hour, as Patriot Games and the ending was a little disappointing with a action-scene credibility problem. Once again - it's getting to be a tired Hollywood theme - top U.S. government officials, going all the way to the President, are corrupt people, liars not to be trusted.THE GOOD - It's nice to see Willem Dafoe finally play a good guy. The villains in here are deceptively interesting, actors such as Joaquim De Almeida, Harris Yulin and Henry Czerny and Miguel Sandoval - not big names but recognizable and good actors. The violence is not overdone in here and when the action does occur, the sound is terrific. The best action scene was shootout in the streets with snipers firing at cars below. The positives are far more than the negatives, making this a solid thriller.",Clear and Present Danger
5,rmax304823,"Okay, Clancy-Type International Action Thriller",6,1 September 2007,"Set between the end of the Cold War and the beginning of the global war on terrorism, the films settles on Colombian cocaine cartels for a convenient set of villains. At that, however, it's a bit unusual for Tom Clancy, presuming the movie incorporates details from his novel. For one thing, the story allows at least one of the real murdering heavies to have a couple of kids that he delights in. And, BANG, the American Navy blows up a house full of drug lords and children. Unwittingly, to be sure, but still -- Secondly, the bad-guys-in-chief are not the Colombian drug lords. Their evil is taken for granted. Instead, the worst people are American politicians who undertake to do ""the Potomac two-step"" by engaging in illegal operations in a foreign country while preserving ""plausible deniability"" for the slyly knowing President. The PRESIDENT, mind you! What we seem to have here is not exactly a film a clef, but at least an approximation of the Iran/Contra affair under President Reagan, in which Admiral Poindexter, F. B. I. head Casey, and Col. Oliver North did some sub rosa trading, which Reagan had no knowledge of. But those real-life events only provide a framework for a fantasy in which sneaky Washington politicians agree to help a drug lord put a lock on cocaine shipments in return for his guarantee that he'll turn over all the information he gains on his rivals, which will double our drug arrests and boost the president's popularity.The price to be paid for this agreement is that the slimy pols immediately shut down a Special Ops mission involving a dozen of our armed forces' picked men. They do so, betraying the mission in the process. This leads to a couple of American deaths and the capture of the rest of the unit. A fierce fire fight at the end results in their extraction by helicopter, led by the stalwart Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford) and the better trained Willem DaFoe. I hope that some of us, those who paste bumper stickers on their cars that say things like, ""Surrender is Not an Option,"" will note that the Special Ops guys here, hopelessly outnumbered and surrounded, not only sensibly surrendered but lived to fight another day. In case you might miss the irony, the director cross cuts between the pious pompous platitudes given by the president at a state funeral, and the terrifying hell our doomed men in Colombia find themselves trapped in. It worked better during the baptism/slaughter at the climax of ""The Godfather"" but it's still effective.The film is pretty well done and must have been expensive to shoot. Lots of action scenes and an entire hacienda is blown to bits by a laser-guided bomb in a most spectacular boom. (Actually several spectacular booms as the special effects detonations went off in different places at slightly different times.) The technical stuff about paper-made bombs is pretty interesting. What a techie Clancy must be. In one earlier boom, Jack Ryan tumbles forward toward the camera while a slow-motion fireball explodes behind him. If I see this unbelievably hoary cliché one more time, I'm going to call the police, the FCC, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Holy Name Society.What happens in franchises like the Jack Ryan saga is that as time goes by, as the characters become familiar, as the story lines coalesce insensibly into one another, the writers start killing off some of the people we've gotten used to seeing. Children, of course, are always at risk, but usually one of the first guys to go is a mentor. It took Rocky Balboa three cracks to kill Burgess Meredith. I think it's taken the same amount of time for Jack Ryan to lose Greer (James Earl Jones), the admirable Admiral.Situation report. If you liked the earlier Jack Ryan stories, you'll like this one too. It's a little more disjointed in its plot, but has just as much in the way of intrigue and action, and Ryan remains the same boy scout he's always been.",Clear and Present Danger
6,ma-cortes,"Jack Ryan's third entry with lots of noisy action , tension and thriller",7,20 January 2008,"Third installment of the Agent Jack Ryan with lots of gun-rattling action, suspense and intrigue. Ryan is a high officer from CIA ,married(Anne Archer) and with sons(Thora Birch).After death a closed friend by Colombian drugs Cali cartel(Miguel Sandoval,Joaquin De Almeida) , the President(Donald Moffat) himself sanctions a covert operation against the drug barons by sending crack soldiers into the Colombia country under the command of mercenaries(Willem Dafoe,Benjamin Bratt, Raymond Cruz). Harrison Ford's Jack Ryan contracted into White House's staff(Harris Yulin, Henry Czerny,Dean Jones) investigates the events. Ryan thinks he's still after Colombian connections to the dead man's money.This blockbuster is an excellent adaptation of the novel by Tom Clancy , companion to ¨The hunt for Red October¨ with Ford taking over the role of Ryan from Alec Baldwin and second part ¨Patriot games¨ again with Harrison Ford , who's becoming the king of trilogies . Extraordinaries nail-biting action scenes, specially when Ryan and his partners are trapped by machine-gunners in a network of narrows streets and posteriorly parodied by Leslie Nielsen. Interesting screenplay plenty of twists and thrills by John Milius and Steve Zaillian. Spectacular musical score fitting to action and suspense by James Horner. Colorful and atmospheric cinematography by Donald McAlpine. The picture is well directed by Phillip Noyce, an action movies expert, but he directed ¨Blind fury, The Saint, The Bone Collectors and Patriot games¨ among others. Rating: Above average, the film will like to Harrison Ford fans and Jack Ryan novels followers.",Clear and Present Danger
7,edwagreen,Unclear is this Present Danger **1/2,6,10 June 2006,"Harrison Ford in this disappointing film about the affects of a Colombian cartel group dealing with drugs.Ford gets a top job at the CIA when the director (James Earl Jones) develops a terminal illness.It seems that the President and his assistant are involved in a covert war in Colombia when they are denying this. Ford, their dupe, appears before Congress and is questioned by the late Hope Lange, who portrays a U.S. senator in one brief scene.The action really starts when an adviser goes to Colombia to negotiate getting back U.S. money. He is murdered there and his assistant, possibly his lover, is found dead the same day as he is killed.The film falls into other Tom Clancy books made into films. There is plenty of action but a lack of cohesiveness.",Clear and Present Danger
8,sunwarrior13,Ford Brings Freshness In His Second Portrayal Of Jack Ryan.,9,11 November 2014,"Clear And Present Danger is a spy action thriller that is based on the novel of Tom Clancy of the same title.It features Harrison Ford in the title role as Jack Ryan with James Earl Jones,who portrays as Vice-Admiral James Greer together with supporting cast that includes Willem Dafoe,Miguel Sandoval,Belita Moreno and Joaquim de Almeida.it was directed by Philip Noyce,who also was at helm in other Jack Ryan films such as The Hunt For Red October and Patriot Games.The film's setting happens when Jack Ryan has been appointed as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) acting Deputy Director.He later discovers that he is being kept in the dark by some of his CIA colleagues in the agency about a covert war operation against the drug lords at Colombia.Later,it was also revealed that the President's wealthy friend is well-connected to the said Colombian drug cartel.When the national security adviser and the CIA deputy director were captured in Colombia,the President's men decided to abandon their force.In the end,it was up to Jack Ryan and another operative to rescue them on their won risking his career and life. This is the second time that Harrison Ford will portray Jack Ryan after Patriot Games and he brings earnestness and freshness to the role.Aside from that,it the story provides complex political intrigue,interesting plot and lots of tension that it is fun to sit through as it is exciting and entertaining from beginning to end.Despite some confusion that it may provide in the political ideologies and beliefs that the characters in it adhere to including the President,what stands out here though is the moral dilemma that Jack Ryan as it brings his humanistic side of saving lives in danger which could probably considered the overall theme of this action thriller.",Clear and Present Danger
9,hitchcockthelegend,These drug cartels represent a clear and present danger to the national security of the United States.,7,23 March 2019,"The third outing for Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan - and the second with Harrison Ford in the lead - is a tightly constructed political thriller. Condensing Clancy's door stoppers is no easy task, but the makers here, headed by director Phillip Noyce, have manged to keep the pic brisk and intelligent for entertainment worth.Plot essentially boils down to America's war on drugs and the Colombian cartel at the helm of such operations. Naturally all is a bit suspect in the American corridors of power, leading to corruption and abuse of power that puts Jack Ryan firmly at the front to sift and destroy the bad eggs staining the American Star Spangled Banner.This very much plays out for those who like a bit of politico subterfuge, whist being ok with long passages of like minded chatter is also a requisite. That we have a fine cast playing out the screenplay (Donald E. Stewart, Steven Zaillian and John Milius) is a big plus that gives credibility to the shifty machinations.There's a nagging annoyance throughout that this still should be a better film, especially given the overstretched run time of 2 hours 20 minutes, and the computer sections are dubious and the finale is something of a damp squib. However, we are in the company of great pros, both in front of and behind the camera - and also on the page (Clancy's brain superlative). With that in mind it's reasons to seek this out and enjoy if this splinter of political thriller is your bag. 7/10",Clear and Present Danger

His intelligence officer (Joaquim de Almeida) is playing both ends against the middle, and that makes it more exciting.Willem Dafoe plays an expatriate doing work for the government in Columbia, and is outstanding.The action when the CIA convoy was attacked was some of the best I have seen.Ford was magnificent.",Clear and Present Danger
11,Calicodreamin,Lacked action,5,2 September 2021,"Harrison Ford spent this whole film being a beaurocrat and ducking from any action, which was a big let down. The storyline was predictable and too long winded.",Clear and Present Danger
12,Boba_Fett1138,Standard but well made movie.,7,13 November 2005,"This is a good and above average political thriller with action elements in it. Still the movie gets a bit too complicated at times and isn't always easy to follow. The movie is also long and some point of the movie are dragging on, even though the pace always remains good and high.It's hard to say in which genre this movie can be put. For an action movie it doesn't have enough action and for a thriller the story isn't good enough. It makes ""Clear and Present Danger"" a bit of a mixed movie that is far from perfect but still remains a perfectly watchable movie with some great actors and some memorable moments.Main problem I had with the movie is that it lacked a distinctive visual style. A problem all Phillip Noyce movies always have. That's why I'm not a too big fan of Phillip Noyce movies, with the exception of ""Dead Calm"" maybe, which simply had a very solid and tense story. ""Clear and Present Danger"" is a good made movie but it just is too simply and standard done all and it isn't really anything new.The cast is great and has some big names in it; Harrison Ford, James Earl Jones, Harris Yulin, Donald Moffat, Henry Czerny, Joaquim de Almeida, Miguel Sandoval, Benjamin Bratt, Willem Dafoe, Ted Raimi in a small role and a still very young Thora Birch.The music by James Honer is really good. Even though it's typical Horner stuff, like he always used in his '90's movies, it works really well for the movie and truly uplifts the movie at times.There are some good moments in the movie that are highly memorable such as the convoy ambush which has become a bit of a classic already perhaps. Yes, the movie is perfectly watchable but the story isn't always the best to follow and at times the storytelling is lacking. Still, a movie that I would recommend to you.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Clear and Present Danger
13,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"This time... it's personal. Well, not as much as before, but, uh, still... nevermind",7,23 August 2008,"Special Collector's Edition review. I haven't read the novel. The first Ford attempt came off as more his movie than a properly done one based on a book by a solid writer. This gets closer to a healthy mix of the two. There is still action, and it's well-done, but it doesn't feel like it's struggling with the political thriller aspects for the spotlight(not only because of the considerably lesser amount). The pacing is pretty good, this is never boring. The plot is interesting, and I'd say the Clancy feel is a stronger presence in this than in its immediate predecessor(hey, you can go elsewhere for a straight Harrison flick, no?). The acting is relatively solid all the way. The characters are well-written and credible, for the most part. The editing and cinematography tend to be nice in this. The special effects leave little to be desired. The dialog has memorable lines, like the first in the series. The language does have some harsh words, but fewer(not to be confused with milder) than in the previous effort. The DVD holds a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to fans of the franchise, Tom Clancy and/or Harrison Ford. 7/10",Clear and Present Danger
14,view_and_review,Refreshingly Good,8,17 August 2020,"Harrison Ford is back as Jack Ryan and what an excellent choice. This time the U.S. government has gotten itself mixed up in trying to eliminate a drug cartel that killed a U.S. citizen who was a friend of the POTUS. There's a lot of double crossing, secret deals, and black ops in this thriller.C&PD is an intelligent thriller that doesn't rely on a lot of bullets and bombs to bail it out. There is some shooting and explosions, but it is in moderation so as to intensify the anxious situations. C&PD relies on a detailed script following various branches of the intelligence community, the Colombian drug cartel, and elite soldiers. I was enthralled. I was totally wrapped up in the movie, which was so refreshing after having watched a few big budget demolition fests.",Clear and Present Danger
15,AaronCapenBanner,Drug Cartels,7,5 December 2013,"Philip Noyce returned to direct this adaptation of the Tom Clancy novel that also sees Harrison Ford return as CIA analyst Jack Ryan, who has been appointed acting Deputy Director of Intelligence after his old boss and friend Admiral Greer(played by James Earl Jones) develops terminal cancer. Almost immediately, Jack has a crisis on his hands as a close friend of the President(played by Donald Moffat) is killed by a drug cartel, and unknown to Jack, a secret CIA operative(played by Willem Dafoe) was sent into Columbia to deal with the cartels, but has been set up, and now wants revenge. Jack must sort out this mess to not only save his career and reputation, but also several lives. Equally good third entry in the series is both exciting and intriguing, with solid performances. Sad to say, Ford's last appearance in the role(before it was ""rebooted""...)",Clear and Present Danger
16,Aaron1375,The Clear and Present Danger for me was being put to sleep at times with this movie.,5,12 January 2010,"The movie was not all bad, but compared to the other two Clancy movies I have seen (Patriot Games/The Hunt for Red October) this one was by far the least entertaining and least interesting of the bunch. It is also not very memorable as I have a hard time recollecting much about it aside from William Defoe's rather good performance and Harrison Ford as a not quite as intense Jack Ryan as he was in the ""Patriot Games"". Anne Archer is back as well, unfortunately she may as well not be in the movie at all as they have basically assigned her a cameo appearance in this one which is sad considering how much of a factor she was in the previous movie. Still, that is understandable as she may have not played all that an important of a role in the novel either. The action comes in small doses and there is a particularly good one featuring a bunch of cars being blocked in and a missile launcher, however the connection I felt with the characters in ""Patriot Games"" is lost so none of the action scenes really reel me in as they did in the previous two movies as the characters are not as interesting as say those in ""The Hunt for Red October"". Still thanks to William Defoe and some good action here and there it is not a total loss in the least.",Clear and Present Danger
17,Mr-Fusion,"As a sequel, this is bigger in scope, but lacking in character",6,4 October 2013,"""Clear and Present Danger"", while grander and more daring (with its secret war premise) than its predecessor oddly comes off as just an adequate sequel. The ingredients were all here, it was just undercooked. Casting's just as solid as it was in ""Patriot Games"" on top of Harrison Ford and James Earl Jones, now we have Harris Yulin, Henry Czerny, Willem Dafoe and Joaquim de Almeida (always a badass). But the film's real excitement doesn't heat up until the third act, when Ford and Dafoe band together to clean up the mess. And I'd argue that Dafoe or even Yulin are the more interesting characters in the grand scheme of things (even poor Jones' death lacks impact, as he never had time to develop character). And the bad news is that, by the time we get to the good parts, it kinda felt like a chore getting there. 6/10Just how ""Hollywood"" or outlandish did the premise for ""Clear and Present Danger"" seem in the mid-'90s? Seems these days, it'd be a piece of cake to get an illegal war going. Also, Ford's epic staredown with the Prez is a crowd-pleaser.",Clear and Present Danger

19,JamesHitchcock,The Old Potomac Two-Step,7,4 March 2008,"This was Harrison Ford's second outing as Jack Ryan following ""Patriot Games"" from two years earlier. (The character was also played by Alec Baldwin in ""The Hunt for Red October"" and Ben Affleck in ""The Sum of all Fears"", neither of which I have seen). The plot concerns a covert war being waged by American troops against drug traffickers in Colombia authorised by the President and his aides without the approval of Congress. Ryan, who has been promoted to Deputy Director of the CIA following the death of his mentor Admiral Greer, has to try and uncover the truth, which puts him into danger as the bad guys try to cover their tracks.""Clear and Present Danger"" is in many ways a different film from ""Patriot Games"", and both have their strengths and weaknesses. ""Patriot Games"" was a more straightforward film. Although the villains were Irish terrorists there was no serious attempt to analyse, or make a statement about, the Northern Ireland situation; Irish terrorism was simply used as the basis for an exciting action thriller. ""Clear and Present Danger"" is a longer film than ""Patriot Games""- at nearly two and a half hours it probably exceeds the optimum length for a thriller- and with more talk and less action, although there are some good action sequences. Those that stand out are the ""computer duel"" between Ryan and Ritter and the scenes where Ryan travels to Colombia to try and rescue the American soldiers who have been abandoned by the President in an attempt to try and prevent the truth coming out.It is a more political film about corruption in high places and the misuse of authority, reminiscent of Watergate and possibly also the Iran/Contra affair. There has been some debate on this board about whether President Bennett is a villain, although to me it seems quite clear that the film-makers intended to portray him as one. His decision to send troops into Colombia is motivated less by a desire to combat the international drugs trade than by a desire to avenge a personal friend who has been murdered on the orders of Ernesto Escobedo, a powerful drug lord from whom he had stolen money. (The surname Escobedo suggests that this character was based upon the real-life drug baron Pablo Escobar). He orders soldiers into action and then abandons them to their fate out of political expediency. There is also the question of the legality of his actions. The film takes the view that they are clearly illegal because they violate the War Powers Act 1973. The constitutionality of this Act, in fact, has been denied- not least by every President since its passage- but none of those Presidents have ever attempted to challenge it in the Supreme Court.Harrison Ford is once again very good as Ryan, perhaps even better than he was in ""Patriot Games"". Ford is not as versatile as some actors, but he does have his strengths, and playing solid, decent and reliable heroes is one of them, displayed not only in his Jack Ryan films but also in films like ""Witness"", ""The Fugitive"", ""K-19 The Widowmaker"" and the Indiana Jones series. Ryan's function in this film is not only as its action hero but also as its moral anchor. He is the man who can be relied upon to stand up for honour and decency, the man who, unlike officials from the President downwards, refuses to dance the ""Old Potomac Two-Step"" of concealment and corruption. (The phrase is taken from a key scene at the end of the film, when he refuses the President's blandishments to cover up the scandal). Political conspiracy thrillers have becomes something of a Hollywood cliché ever since Watergate, but this is one of the better ones.",Clear and Present Danger
20,disdressed12,"better than Patriot Games,but still pretty slow and boring",6,8 August 2007,"while i don't think this is a great movie,i do think it is better than the the last one,Jack Ryan film,Patriot Games.in Clear and Present Danger,Harrison Ford once again plays Jack Ryan.this one has a bit more intrigue than Patriot Games,and i also like the story more.it is more developed.to me,this one has a bigger scope.there is bit more urgency as well.having said that,i still think this movie is boring and slow,more often than not.Like Patriot Games,it's certainly not awful,but again i think maybe something got lost in the translation from Tom Clancy's novel.it's also almost 2 and a half hours long,and i think they could have trimmed some of it.still,it has it's good moments.for me,Clear and Present Danger is a 6/10",Clear and Present Danger

That's probably not a good sign for a movie I thought I liked.The first half of this movie plays like a TV movie with a plot a seven year old could follow and the film really doesn't pick up until act 2. Luckily, by then we're invested and totally rooting for John/Jack Ryan. 21 years later and only my 2nd viewing in as many years, I believe it somewhat holds up. Not to mention and comparatively speaking, it blows the other Jack Ryan installments out of the water, with the exception of The Hunt for Red October.

22,sol1218,Your word is You,8,23 June 2006,"***SPOILERS*** Spoting a yacht sailing erratically in the choppy waters off Florida the US Coast Guard has the boat boarded. On board they find that it's owner was murdered together along with his wife and two children by the group of Columbian drug traffickers who sea-jacked the craft. The man who together with his family that was murdered happened to be businessman Peter Hardin the Presdent of the United States Pres. Bennett, Donald Moffat, best friend.Outraged at what happened to his friend Pres. Bennett sets into motion a plan to get those who ordered Hardin and his family's murder with his top two advisor's Cutter & Ritter, Harris Yulin & Henry Czerny. To cover his and his advisor's behinds puts the now new CIA Deputy Director Jack Ryan, Harrison Ford, is put officially in charge. Ryan working together with the CIA comes up with the startling findings that Hardin, the presidents best friend, was a major money launder for the Cali Drug Cartel. Hardin using his business and banking expertise was skimming off the profits, that his bosses in the cartel needed to continue their operations, and that was the reason for his and his family's murder.Getting retired US Special Forces officer John Clark,Willen Defoe, to get a 12 man strike force to hit the Cali Cartel where it hurts, in it's drug processing operations,Ritter is going against Dept. director's Ryan's sworn testimony to the US Congress. Ryan testified that no US military personnel will be used to fight the Columbian drug dealers putting the unsuspecting Ryan in danger, if the operation is ever found out, of being indited for perjury, in him lying to the US Congress.As all these undercover dealings are going on the head of the Cali Cartel Ernesto Escobedo, Miguel Sandoval, chief counselor and ex-Castro intelligence agent Col. Felix Cortez, Jaquim de Almeida,is planing to set up his boss by getting him knocked off by the CIA. Cortez is also setting up rest of the Cartel leaders to be whacked by arraigning a major hit on the US governments representatives in Columbia. Later there's a Cortez sponsored attack in Bogata killing 5 Secret Service Agents and the the FBI chief Jacobs,Tom Tammi, with Cortez pining the attack on the ""innocent"" drug dealers.Cortez has his lover and FBI director Jacobs private secretary Moira Wolfson, Ann Magnuson, unwittingly give him the information of Jacobs whereabouts. This helps Cortez in having Jacobs trapped in a motorcade in downtown Bogata where he was gunned down. Cortez then plans to make a deal with the US, after he had the Cali Cartel leaders knocked off, to take over the cartel's operations and cut the drug supply to the US in half. Making the US government's drug fighting agency DEA and the FBI, as well as President Bennett, look like their ""War on Drugs"" is a big success to the American people,It turns out that Cortez's master plan miss-fires when it's discovered after a massacre of most of the cartel leaders, with the exception of Escobedo, that it wasn't a car bomb that was first reported by the news that did them in! It was a laser-guided missile, that could have only been used by the USAF, that did the job. With the sh*t hitting the fan all over D.C and the members of Congress demanding to know why the US military was involved in this unauthorized ""hit"" two things are quickly put into motion by presidential advisor's Cutter & Ritter 1. the US troops sent into Columbia are sold out by giving up their positions to the cartel mercenaries in order to have them all killed so they'll never live to tell the truth about their mission and 2. Jack Ryan is saddled with the blame for the secret operation with him made, by Cutter & Ritter, to look like he authorized it which he didn't.Despite it's very complicated plot ""Clear and Present Danger"" is a top rate political thriller that never lets up, or lets you down, in it's nerve racking suspense. The movie ends with two great final sequences with Jack Ryan having it out in Columbia with Cortez and his hoods in order for him and Clark, the head of the sold-out US troops, to save the remaining US soldiers held captive. The ending just flipped me, as I assume everyone else who saw it, out with an incredible confrontation between Ryan and President Bennett right in the Oval Office that has to be seen to be believed! It's here more then anywhere else in "" Clear and Present Danger"" where I hoped that for once, just this ONCE, that life would imitate art!",Clear and Present Danger
23,g-bodyl,Jack Ryan Is Back!,8,11 February 2013,"Harrison Ford is back as Jack Ryan, the star of the famous Tom Clancy novels, in this ""new"" adventure, Clear and Present Danger. When compared to Hunt for Red October and Patriot Games, this is probably the worst film. But, it still is a pretty good, tense film with some crafty action scenes.Philip Noyce's film is about how Jack Ryan moves up in the world since his boss is very ill. His first mission as CIA acting deputy director, is too stop the trafficking of drugs in Colombia quick and quietly. But there already may be a team there.....Harrison Ford is good as always in his role as Jack Ryan. I noticed that unlike Patriot Games, he seems reluctant to carry a gun. James Earl Jones is also really good and his performance made me connect with my emotions.Overall, this is a solid thriller which displayed some good action scenes. The story is nothing new as many movies these days focus on drug cartels. But if done right, it can still be good. I rate this film 8/10.",Clear and Present Danger

25,Dr_Coulardeau,"Not even political fiction, just plain reality",10,23 October 2010,"At first it looks like a banal drug film with some CIA agents trying to find out who killed a couple of people and why, people who were personal friends of the President of the US. Just that makes things tricky, I mean the fact that the victims were friends of the President of the US. Be discreet Jack. But things are also trickier than they look and I don't want to tell you the film. I am just going to give a few ideas about politics first. A politician always lies, by definition and by principle. It sounds pessimistic and it is. Never believe a politician, no matter what side he is on and what side you are on. A politician will always do what the circumstances will make him do under pressure. If he is wise he will listen to his advisers and he will think then. If he is not wise he will run into the wall and push with his head. He may break through, but anyway afterwards he will tell you tall tales. The second element is that you have to serve politicians, no matter what and just try to cover your back and by back I mean under your lower back. You can serve them well it does not matter. If there is a problem you will be the fuse. If the problem was big, you may be the fuse, but the politicians will get it on their heads. But that will not give you what you deserve: a medal and a premium for serving them well. The film brings up another line of reflection. Politicians do not give a damn about the life of the people who are defending the country or who are fighting just or unjust wars for their country. Politicians consider these fighters as pawns on their chessboard and if they die they are collateral victims of their own game. Too bad for them they were those who had to die. If they died with honor they might get some coverage and recognition, otherwise they might get buried under a pile of rocks in some jungle. Their families will be handed a casket full of stones. But beyond these fighters in uniform do not believe civilians are in any way considered in this matter. Civilians are not even collateral damage. They are just collateral garbage. And unluckily that's the fundamental point here. Who cares about children, women, and plain civilians. They should not have been here in the first place. Good riddance, next time they will not be dumb enough to be present on a future mass crime scene. That's how you get out of that film. And the last scene will not change anything. There is no justice in such a situation. You may see the politician who exploited you fall because his arrogance brings him down, but that will not be justice for you who will have footed the bill of that liar. So make up your mind and just accept to be used, over-used and abused by politicians: that's their fundamental function and you are a sucker by definition since you are not in politics.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID",Clear and Present Danger
26,johnnyboyz,"Involving, although often too robotic, Ryan entry which knows what it has to do but often strikes us as to not knowing how to do it.",6,31 July 2013,"Where does one go after having taken on, and successfully parried, the threat of that of both Communism and Terrorism? Why, to wage war on Narcotics of course. At least, that is how the good folks charged with bringing to life the adventures of a C.I.A. agent named Jack Ryan see it, as too does the series original author Tom Clancy, whose source material I read was actually published on the brink of the Cold War's termination. With the Irish and the Soviets vanquished, that of Colombia's cocaine barons are next up on the chopping block for the world's most powerful intelligence agency. There is an eerie procession to things in that regard that mirrors today, an attitude of bountifully hopping from ideology to ideology; from nationality to nationality usurping the tyrants and conquering the odds– not so far away from modern foreign policy: the action starts when things kick off that we like neither the looks or sounds of it.Clear and Present Danger is probably the most cryptic of the first three Ryan adaptations – I imagine its title is meant somewhat ironically, as there are times when things are anything but clear and the narrative can actually be quite overwhelming. Thankfully, this is not a case of the same stuff being regurgitated as Ryan charges about; does his thing and works everything out in the end. This is the sort of 'action' film whereby romping scores of circumstance and pomp put to sets heavy in the decour of American governmental iconography, as two men bicker and grimace intently over a situation, is discernible as the 'spectacle'. Things have moved on internally, also. Where in ""The Hunt for Red October"" Ryan was more of a middle man caught in a cross-fire who was charged with investigating and, ultimately, defusing a situation, his role changed dramatically in ""Patriot Games"", where he found himself an agent at the heart of a field operation. In Phillip Noyce's Clear and Present Danger, he has effectively been promoted to that of chief of operations following some health issues with James Earl Jones' evergreen ""M"" figure.The film begins where the last one culminated: at sea. An American Navy vessel flags down a luxury yacht which, to their horror, has been invaded by rouge South American Cartel members and has had its rightful owners executed. Where things suddenly become relevant is when this innocent party of murder victims are revealed to have been close friends to the American president, something which launches an investigation where previously these tyrants were getting away with the horrors associated with trafficking; smuggling and murder anyway. The leader of these renegades is a certain Ernesto Escobedo (Sandoval), who's a poor excuse for a Robert Davi villain from a then-not-too-recent Bond film about similar themes. Escobedo is rich; has a huge house; a loving family and enjoys baseball, but from within a certain Cuban aide by the name of Cortez (de Almeida) has his own ideas on Escobedo's empire.The film launches itself into too very distinct cuts of raw material, with on the one hand Ryan's task of leading the Cartel investigation dominating with a very blue, very cold Washington atmosphere as the snow and chilly conditions settle in just as equally cold levels of animosity are met with practically everything Ryan does via his peers. On the other, an elite team of SEAL commandos land in the warmer, greener and brighter South American jungles. The team is mostly made up of insignificant extras, although one such trooper of a sniper class gets his own introduction et al. early on; thus, it is of little surprise that he's the only one left upon which to focus when the mission gets messy later on. One item, of which there can be little doubt, is Harrison Ford's worthiness in the role. There is a moment early on when he walks into his superior's office; there is a smirk, some small talk and a pile of papers outlining the latest situation. Straight away, we're at home with him in the role and he brings a measured assuredness to the part.The film plays out with that invisible confidence films as cryptic as these often have, that nonchalant swagger as it dives into yet another scene drenched in conflict and suspicion; only assuming that you're keeping up but delivering the blows for you even if you haven't quite. It certainly reminds us of how good-a job the team made of The Hunt for Red October, which was equally involving in this regard although always had the benefit of things zeroing in on that lone submarine so things were never going to be able to go too far astray in the first place. To another extent, it highlights just how limp in comparison to ""Hunt"" Patriot Games was; a revenge film which is made to look fairly bog-standard and unspectacular in comparison in spite of its traversing of the globe and its taking of its characters to some pretty dire emotional places. Perhaps that was the point; Noyce has essentially overcompensated in that regard, lumping onto us more of what we thought we got in ""Hunt"" that we didn't get any of in ""Games"" – something that was Noyce's fault in the first place. As a result, I think it finds a comfortable spot in-between the two.",Clear and Present Danger
27,filipemanuelneto,"This movie is worth seeing, especially for the good performances of Harrison Ford and Joaquim de Almeida.",7,28 July 2019,"We have seen a lot of movies about US government covert operations. This is just one more. The script is not difficult to explain: at sea, the family of a US president's friend is massacred by a Colombian drug cartel, and it turns out that there were interests and business between them. Realizing the power of the cartels, the US president, backed by the CIA director general, decides to make the phrase ""war on drugs"" literal by ordering a covert operation that aims to dismantle the cartel. An operation that will be funded directly by the Senate without anyone - not even Jack Ryan, who makes the request for funding - knows that the money will be used to send soldiers to the ground.The movie is nothing particularly different from many others involving the same ingredients. There is a group of serious men who are really trying to stop that drug cartel without doing anything illegal, and others who will not look at the means, and do not mind sacrificing some innocent lives in the process. There are truly good action scenes, although the movie was not made as an action movie. Personally, I consider the Bogotá ambush and chase scenes one of the best in the movie. The sound, visual and sound effects are those that existed at the time, and they do well as expected. Phillip Noyce did a good job as a director.As for the actors, we have a good Harrison Ford, convincing and capable in the leading role. Willem Dafoe is equally capable in his role. Henry Czerny, Harris Yulin, and Donald Moffat have all managed to be truly machiavellian, as good career politicians, and made their characters truly obnoxious. Miguel Sandoval did well as Escobedo, but the one who impressed me the most was Joaquim de Almeida. The Portuguese actor, who appears humbly almost halfway through the film, gradually reveals himself and makes his character one of the most important for the outcome of the film. He is an excellent actor, even though his background makes him better known to the Portuguese than to the American public.Not being a brilliant movie, nor original in its essence, its able to entertain the audience and give us a good story. It has a good and committed cast, fulfilling its purpose and giving us a good final product.",Clear and Present Danger
28,leplatypus,Clear and present criticism (tv),7,28 February 2015,"Well, this movie is really surprising because it's really the first time that I see a Hollywood blockbuster adapting without filtering a bestseller in which the famous writer really depicts the pool of sharks at Washington DC and especially in the white house. In short, what triggers a more energetic politic against drug cartels is just the assassination of POTUS friends. This kind of personal revenge is indeed a special way to uphold national interest. As Nixon, POTUS feels he is not bounded by laws or frontiers as he authorizes guerrilla in other country. And he is so cynical that he doesn't order it clearly and when bad news arrive, he would like to put the blame to innocent mans (here, Admiral Greer). This aspect of revealing Washington life would be the trademark in later Clancy novels, always coupled with an armed conflict. Here, i must say that the drug cartel isn't a « prestigious » adversary but a rather boring, dull one. In that, the movie equals the book because I remember to be among the weakest Clancy ever wrote. However, Harrison as the white, honorable hero is always perfect and Dafoe as an experimented veteran is an excellent partner.",Clear and Present Danger

Admiral Greer (James Earl Jones), Ryan's mentor is suddenly taken ill and appoints Ryan as his replacement as Deputy Director of National Security.Meanwhile, friends of President Bennett (Donald Moffat) have been murdered and connected to the drug lords of Columbia. The President's National Security Adviser, James Cutter (Harris Yulin) and his assistant Ritter (Henry Czerny) arrange to have a group of US Army snipers under the direction of agent John Clark (Willem Dafoe)infiltrate Columbian territory and disrupt the drug trade by destroying drug shipments.Drug lord Ernesto Escobedo (Miquel Sandoval) becomes alarmed and assigns his security chief Felix Cortez (Joaquim de Almeida) to find out who is responsible. Cortez gains the confidence of the secretary of the FBI Director, Moira Wolfson (Ann Magnuson) and learns that Director Jacobs (Tom Tammi) will been sent to Columbia on a secret mission by the President. Ryan already in Columbia, will join the party.Cortez, who has ambitions of his own, sees this as his chance to take over and attacks the convoy carrying the FBI Director and Ryan.

There really is not that much more to it.In this sequel to Patriot Games, Jack Ryan is caught up between the personal vendettas of the President of the United States and some Columbian drug lords. I have to give this movie a bit of credit for creating such a really banal President that seems atrocious even now that we've gotten used to Dubya and all that, and its enjoyable elements include a really neat sniper character, Willem Dafoe, and helicopters. It wouldn't be a Tom Clancy story without helicopters.Harrison Ford puts off his usual ""Good family guy forced into a fight he doesn't want to have in the first place,"" and this time his good-boy role is taken to a kind of different level wherein it actually becomes his own problem, but it's not like he really has to expand as an actor or anything to pull it off.

After seeing Clear and Present Danger, it is clear and present to me that director Phillip Noyce learned from his few mistakes in Patriot Games. This movie is faster, stronger, and more interesting. Harrison Ford gives another solid performance. There is less of a character to Ryan in this screenplay, but he also strikes me as more heroic. We end up rooting for him rather than just watching him. So far we have seen Ryan take on the Soviet Navy and the IRA, this time he gets involved with a Columbian drug lord.There is one potential problem with Clear and Present Danger. The movie requires just as much from the audience as it gives them. There is entertainment to be had here, but only if you pay close attention. The plot is complex, and fairly easy to get lost in. I personally don't see what is so hard about paying attention to a film, but with the action genre, I think people prefer to be entertained in a mindless eye candy kind of way rather than a thought provoking-thriller kind of way (but that's just my bias).Clear and Present Danger is still a good movie.

Or a B-grade Van Damme movie. But when you're making a political thriller by a clever writer like Tom Clancy, why waste his CIA/FBI insider writing on this drivel? You've got the heavily accented Central American drug lords. The reactionary American administration waging its pointless War on Drugs. And perpetually constipated Harrison Ford pretending to be, what, a pencil-pusher thrust into action by circumstances.And once you've seen Get Shorty, where the same Latin American drug lord shows up looking for his money and his nephew Yayo.

That's why I've already seen several of his movies and that's also the reason why I gave this movie a try. I'm normally not too much a fan of action movies, but with him in one of the leading roles, you can always expect something more and better than some simple spectacle.""Clear and Present Danger"" is a movie based on a Tom Clancy novel that tells the story of Doctor Jack Ryan, a CIA analyst who finds himself in the middle of a power struggle within the Colombian drug cartel as well as some dirty political games in the highest ranks of the American political establishment. It all starts with the murder of a close friend and his family of the American president aboard their yacht in the Caribbean, apparently in retaliation for stealing money as part of a money laundering scheme for the cartel. When some of the president's men convince the president to conduct covert actions against the cartel, without telling the Congress of course, and the security chief of one of the cartel bosses tries to play both sides by informing his boss, but trying to organize a coup against the cartel leadership with the help of the CIA at the same time, Ryan soon gets in a very difficult position. When he finds out the entire truth, he sets himself the almost impossible task to save the men that were left behind in the jungle, while trying to save his own reputation and life...Whether everything shown in this movie is possible or not, I can not really say. But one thing is for sure and that is that we certainly will not know everything the president of the USA is involved in or has knowledge of. I'm convinced that everywhere in the world, the CIA does play some dirty tricks so now and then, as long as it is beneficial for them and / or the country. So in that perspective I must say that this entire movie feels quite believable. And even though this isn't the best movie I've ever seen Harrison Ford play in, I must say that he did a nice job in this movie. His character is still believable, because he never seems to use any weapons and certainly isn't some kind of superman who can escape from entire armies without getting a scratch (although it sometimes started to look like it). I don't think the average CIA office worker is used to carry a lot of guns, machine guns, hand grenades, bazooka's or I don't know what other weaponry you sometimes see them use in all those cheap action flicks, so it's a good thing that they didn't have Jack Ryan carry them either. But there is one thing I don't really believe: I don't think that the CIA would ever send such a high ranking employee in the field. Nevertheless, Harrison Ford did a nice job with his role and the same can be said about Willem Dafoe, Anne Archer,... But in the end this is a bit too much an action movie to my taste, even though the action shots are certainly nice to watch. The story and the acting are OK and make that this movie is a lot better than the average action flick. That's why I give this movie a rating between 6.5/10 and 7/10.",Clear and Present Danger

41,vip_ebriega,A crackling thriller at its best.,10,3 October 2007,"My Take: The best of the Tom Clancy adaptations. Harrison Ford is Jack Ryan, and you better believe it. CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER is the third adaptation of yet another Tom Clancy bestseller, spawned by the success of the previous Clancy adaptations THE HUNT FOR RED October and PATRIOT GAMES. CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER, like the previous films, successfully thrills their audiences with exciting sequences that, also, manages to stay plausible and never too unbelievably silly. CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER may not have succeeded to become a total thrill-ride, but in the end it delivers its political message well. It's a slightly long, but thrilling and exciting Clancy adaptation. Once again, Ford returns as Jack Ryan, who is appointed acting CIA Deputy Director of Intelligence, when CIA Deputy James Greer (James Earl Jones) is ill with cancer. His first mission: To investigate the death of one of the President's closest friends, who has connections with drug cartels. Ryan, once again, fights for what he believes is the truth, unknown to him that the National Security Adviser (Harris Yulin) has already dispatched mercenary elite troops, led by field operator John Clark (Willem Dafoe), on a covert operation in Columbia. But even if you don't get involved with the story or haven't read any of Tom Clancy's bestselling techno-thrillers (like myself), you must admit how exciting, edgy and believable this film is. Once more, it's also well-written on the screen and don't get wasted. When the film doesn't stun you with its action sequences devised by director Phillip Noyce and his crew of cinematographers and stunt directors, it involves you in the political situations made real and plausible by the adapted script by Donald Stewart, John Millius and Steven Zallian. Honestly, the sequences that involves Ryan arguing with the President of the United States are just as good to watch as the films more exciting sequences (The memorable ambush sequence and the RAMBO-esquire finale are the first to come to mind).Even if the film isn't exactly the total ""keeps you on the edge of your seat"" action thriller, CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER delivers its political message as well as thrilling excitement all in the same show.

42,CitizenCaine,Harrison Ford Returns To Play Jack Ryan,7,29 February 2004,"Harrison Ford returns to play Jack Ryan in this mega-hit from the summer of 1994. In this follow-up to Patriot Games, Ford gets involved in a scandalous illegal drug war in Columbia orchestrated by top government officials. As with any film over 2 hours long, there are a few slow moments in the movie. However, for the most part, the film stays on course with alternating action, drama, and suspense scenes. Anne Archer and Thora Birch return in more forgettable roles as Ford's wife and daughter. Several other colorful characters are present, especially Joaquim de Almeida as a sinister cartel figure. Willem Dafoe plays a great role as a CIA contact, who supplies the illegal firepower to attack the cartels. His role should have been developed more; he's on screen all too briefly. James Earl Jones also returns for a farewell performance as Greer, Ryan's mentor. Henry Czerny, Harris Yulin, and Donald Moffat make up the oily triumvirate that Faces Ford. The film has terrific action and suspense sequences, especially the cartel's open attack on Ford's government convoy in the SUV's and the computer battle where Ford tries to run off illegal government doings. Ford's actions are consistent with his character, in that, he never saves the day via extraordinary means by himself, as can be customary in these type of films. One of the few false notes is the sanctimonious tendency of Ryan to self righteously bear the torch of truth, when we all know that being in the CIA can compromise that possibility. *** of 4 stars.",Clear and Present Danger

Harrison Ford's best action political thriller by Tom Clancy's novel!,10,27 February 2016,"Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take Harrison Ford's classic best action political thriller by Tom Clancy's novel, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off.Clear and Present Danger (1994) Is the best of Harrison Ford's classic action political thriller since The Fugitive! I know this film is based on Tom Clancy's novel Clear and Present Danger and is directed by Phillip Noyce. It is a sequel to Patriot games (1992) in which Harrison Ford started as CIA analyst Jack Ryan. Alec Baldwin started as Jack Ryan in an action thriller brilliant flick The Hunt For Red October (1990) with Sean Connery and with the director John McTiernan. Those were all novels that films were based by writer Tom Clancy. My all time favorite films of all five Jack Ryan movies, that were released and are based on Tom Clancy's novels are: The Hunt For Red October (1990) and this one (Clear and Present Danger). Of course The Hunt For Red October isn't Harrison Ford's film, but he later started with Phillip Noyce twice, with the film Patriot Games (1992) and this film (Clear and Present Danger) that I absolutely love it. As a kid, again the same that I have saw the trailer for the film The Fugitive (1993), year later I saw the trailer for this film which it became a hit in 1994, that time I watched Patriot Games with Harrison Ford which I liked. But watching this one again, I must say it is my second favorite Harrison Ford film not counting Indiana Jones films. The first one is The Fugitive and the second one is this one (Clear and Present Danger).Plot: CIA Analyst Jack Ryan is drawn into an illegal war fought by the US government against a Colombian drug cartel.I love this film and it is the second favorite film of mine that I just love to death! Beside Harrison Ford gives you the best outstanding perfect brilliant performance, they are still a support cast from this film that you like to see and are famous. Beside Harrison, James Earl Jones, Anne Archer and Thora Birch all reprise there roles back from Patriot Games. I still don't know why actor Samuel L. Jackson did not reprise his role back to the sequel,but still this film works. When his mentor James Greer (James Earl Jones) becomes gravely ill, Ryan (Harrison Ford)is appointed acting CIA Deputy Director of Intelligence. His first assignment: Investigate the murder of one of the president's friends, a prominent U.S. businessman with secret ties to Colombian drug cartels. Unbeknownst to Ryan, the CIA has already dispatched a deadly field operative (Willem Dafoe) to lead a paramilitary force against the Colombian drug lords. Caught in the crossfire, Ryan takes matters into his own hands, risking his career and life for the only cause he still believes in - the truth.This movie is about Colombian drug cartels, investigation of a murder of one of the president friends and his family, conspiracy and a rescue mission on the end of the film. This movie is intelligent, entertaining and brilliant, it keeps you on the edge of your seat. It keeps guessing you what will happened next. Willem Dafoe finally plays the good guy in this film, which I love him. The action sequences are excellent, the explosions are wonderful and perfectly executed. No CGI or shaky cam in here. The body keeps rising and the acting is brilliant, everyone does an excellent job. In here we have Joaquim de Almeida who is playing another villain, we see him playing another drug lord 17 years later in Fast Five (2011). Here you also have a marines who are destroying a drug cartels and risking their own lives. You even have Tom Bower from Die Hard 2 (1990) in here, who plays a helicopter pilot on a rescue mission. Than is Henry Czerny as another villain in CIA who later started in Mission: Impossible (1996) film. The special effects are perfect, the film is fast paced and goes quickly around for the two hours.About the cast: Harrison Ford did a perfect job playing Jack Ryan CIA analysts who becomes director of CIA when his friend becomes ill, you even have a funeral scene in here and the music score from James Horner is awesome for this film and I love it. James Earl Jones did a perfect acting support. Willem Dafoe was incredible in his role and in my opinion he gave us a perfect acting performance. Henry Czerny did a solid job and Thora Birch in a minor role was perfect. Anne Archer was also great as Jack's wife. ""I'm sorry, Mr. President, I don't dance."" Jack Ryan's best quote for me.Overall: Clear and Present Danger is a classic a perfect 10. Far way better than the last two films that come out and way better than Patriot Games. For me Harrison Ford is the only Jack Ryan CIA analyst I love and no one talks about this film today. I love this film to death!Clear and Present Danger is a 1994 American spy thriller film directed by Phillip Noyce, based on Tom Clancy's book of the same name. It was preceded by the 1990 film The Hunt for Red October and the 1992 film Patriot Games, all three featuring Clancy's fictional character Jack Ryan.10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Paramount Pictures Starring: Harrison Ford, Willem Dafoe, Anne Archer, Joaquim de Almeida, James Earl Jones, Miguel Sandoval, Henry Czerny, Harris Yulin, Donald Moffat, Benjamin Bratt, Raymond Cruz, Thora Birch Director: Phillip Noyce Producers: Mace Neufeld, Robert Rehme Screenplay: Donald E.

45,kenandraf,Bad end action sequece....,9,7 December 2000,"The movie was very entertaining and educational but to be a classic in it's genre,it should have had better action sequences towards the end of the movie.Particularly the scenes of the daring rescue of the special forces from the Colombians.The thrill was there but the action was not powerfull enough which fans of this movie subject will definitely demand.Ford may be getting old but he can still pull off better action sequences than what was shown in this movie.Even the scenes where in the US special forces were defeated by the mercenaries could have been way better.The scenes where the CIA guys were ambushed in their vans was very good.They should have continued with those kind of sequences in the other action scenes.It was a bad decition to tone down the violence too much becouse the seriousness of the movie demands realism to become a classic.Still a good try.I know Ford did not like the way it was done as well and that is why he is reluctant as of now to play Jack Ryan again.Ford knows movies well.I give this one an 8 out of 10.",Clear and Present Danger
46,perfectbond,Decent political thriller,7,22 April 2005,"I have never read any of the Jack Ryan books by Tom Clancy so I don't know how faithful of an adaptation this production was. That said, director Phillip Noyce does a competent job here in blending the realistic-looking (to my untrained eye) action sequences with the dialogue scenes to create some genuine suspense and tension. To be honest though, I watched this only because Harrison Ford was starring. In 1994, he was still the quintessential action hero in cinema (some say he has been for 30 years). In fact, when Nicolas Cage started making action movies in the mid-nineties, he said he modeled much of his work on Ford's. That has to be one of the highest compliments one leading man can give to another!",Clear and Present Danger
47,virek213,"Jack Ryan, The Latin American Drug Wars, And The Truth",9,2 March 2017,"Tom Clancy's CIA analyst character Jack Ryan not only made an impact on the page, he also made an impact on the big screen as well. In the 1990 smash THE HUTN FOR RED October, as played by Alec Baldwin, he was in a race against time to find out whether a renegade Soviet submarine captain was out to defect to America, or out to launch. Then in 1992's PATRIOT GAMES, Ryan, then portrayed by Harrison Ford, went into action to protect his own family against the machinations of vengeful ultra-violent Irish Republican Army terrorists. And then in 1994, again with Ford more than capably assuming the role, Ryan found himself in a pickle much closer to his job: covert military action related to the ongoing Latin American drug war in CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER.Ford's Jack Ryan is put into action into finding the root causes of why one of the closest friends of the President (Donald Moffatt) was killed on his boat in the Caribbean Sea. As it turns out, the president's dead friend had stolen money from a Colombian drug kingpin (Miguel Sandoval), like six hundred forty million dollarsand change. For Ford, this may seem like a fairly routine matter, as is him having to go to Congress to get authorization to fund the Colombian government's war against drug cartels like Sandoval's. But unbeknownst to him, Moffatt, along with his national security adviser (Harris Yulin) and deputy CIA director (Henry Czerny) have hatched a covert operation called Operation Reciprocity to finish off the drug war on American terms, sending a paramilitary unit commanded by a man named Clark (Willem Dafoe) into the hot zone. More importantly, when his mentor Admiral Greer (James Earl Jones) falls victim to inoperable pancreatic cancer that ultimately kills him, the weight of the world falls on his shoulders. Dafoe's team does score hits against Sandoval's operation; but the end result is a series of horrific acts of retribution, including the killing of an FBI team sent to assist Ford, followed by the capture of Dafoe's men by an associate of Sandoval's (Joaquin De Almeida) out to take over Sandoval's operation.Once Ford makes himself aware of the kind of paramilitary finagling that had been going on behind his back, he becomes a fighter once more—not for just his family, but the truth. This means having not only to go back down to the Colombian war zone to rescue Dafoe and his men, but also having to confront a president who has bent, and maybe even broken the law, for political points, and made decisions that resulted in massive losses of lives.Philip Noyce, who had also directed PATRIOT GAMES, returns to the director's chair for this well made and, at close to two and a half hours, epic action/suspense thriller. Not surprisingly, Ford delivers the kind of performance that could easily be classified as a ""thinking man's action hero"" as Ryan, acting not on impulse or an urge for explosions of violence, but a vigilant search for the truth. Ultimately, he wonders, exactly what does constitute a ""clear and present danger"" in the real world? Is it what the president says it is, when it is in the form of drug cartels (who, by the early 2000s, proliferated far closer to the U.S., in rural sections of Mexico)? Or is the real clear and present danger found in a host of decisions merely meant to gain political points? Ford's performance remains the centerpiece of this film, but Sandoval and De Almeida make for a pair of crafty (but non-stereotypical) South American heavies (much of the film was shot in Mexico), and there are also underhanded performances by Yulin and, most especially Czerny, the latter of whom is absolutely oily and corrupt (he would play a similar role only two years later in MISSION IMPOSSIBLE). And when he is not recycling his scores for ALIENS and PATRIOT GAMES, James Horner's score is extremely effective too, veering from typically stirring patriotic Americana to ethnic South American motifs (with pan flutes).Far too many action films from the 1980s onward are all about spectacle, and almost no suspense or substance. But CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER has a lot of those two important things in spades, and still ranks as one of the best films of the action genre during the 1990s.",Clear and Present Danger
48,timdalton007,Enemies Within And Without,9,9 March 2009,"Someone once said that absolute power corrupts absolutely. That saying is the theme at the heart of Clear And Present Danger, the third film in the Jack Ryan film series. With a near perfect combination of acting, action, music and script it is also a thriller of the highest quality.Harrison Ford takes his performance of Jack Ryan up to a new level with this film. His performance as the principled Ryan stays int eh front seat at all times as Ryan confronts those in the film, especially in the final scenes of the film. Ford is also at the top of his game in the action sequences of the film as well proving yet again that Ford is both a fine actor and a fine action hero as well.The rest of the cast is good as well. Willem Dafoe makes a welcomed good guy appearance as Clark, the mysterious CIA operative leading the secret war. Anne Archer makes a welcomed return as Cathy Ryan though she is underused sadly. There's also Henry Czerny and Harris Yulin as the me leading the war of behalf of their President (played expertly by Donald Moffat) plus there's Joaquin De Almeida, Miguel Sandoval, Raymond Cruz, Tim Grimm and of course James Earl Jones. In truth the whole cast is good enough to mention if there was enough space.Of course there's the action sequences of the film. Of special mention is the signature ambush sequence that easily belongs amongst the best action sequences ever dedicated on a frame of film. While that sequence alone is excellent one can't forget about the many other (and smaller) sequences in the film that are no less impressive. Overall though it is unfair to call this an action film by any means.If anything can this describe this film it is the words ""thriller of the highest quality"". The screenwriters took Tom Clancy's superb novel, trimmed down to film length, but kept many of the novel's key points. The result is, when put together with Phillip Noyce's direction and the superb score of James Hormer, an intelligent thrill ride where the corruption of absolute power leads to a secret war with lives and the reputations of nations at stakes where enemies are both within and without with only one man capable of unraveling it all.Clear And Present Danger is a thriller of the most unusual kind. It is a thriller that (in the words of Jack Ryan) sees the world not in black and white but as right and wrong. With its tale of a secret war and hidden agendas, the film is all the better for it. It may even be the best of the Jack Ryan films made so far but don't take my word for it. Go see the film for your self.",Clear and Present Danger

While the plot really isn't out of this world. It is still a good plot which contains a lot of action sequences and with Harrison Ford on board there is a sense of adventure.

It was nearly 3 hours long and I felt it didn't need to be that long.The story has nothing to do with the original movie, which I liked. It was just the same characters in another situation.The original cast returned for this film which is always a good sign. I hate it when someone makes a sequel for a movie but changes the actors for one reason or another. It just makes it better when the original cast returns.Harrison Ford returns as Jack Ryan. He, as always, does a great job. I loved the new cast members to this movie too... Willem Dafoe played John. He was convincing in his role. But I think the actor I am growing to like more and more is Joaquim de Almeida. I have seen him in a few movies now and he has been brilliant in all of them. He really does play a brilliant bad guy.The action in this film is great. There are a lot of really good scenes where the action, explosions and suspense is great. This is another good 90s action film. It's one of those films that you have no idea who to trust... it is better not to trust anyone.I really did like this film, but it was on for too long and it was not as good as the original film. It would have been good if they made a few more of these with this character, just as long as Harrison returned as Jack. He could have been the new James Bond.I will give this film 6 out of 10.It is a shame there were no more.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",Clear and Present Danger

And the action sequence towards the end is a well-built up and solidly drawn.
Even the drug cartel plot, something usually wrung dry from the cloth of cliche, is not too OTT. And the death of James Earl Jones' character is a strangely human and grounding subplot.
Ford here also is slung well in the groove of Jack Ryan, and seems to hit that balance between recently promoted interim CIA analyst/director and action moviestar.",Clear and Present Danger

55,OttoVonB,Clancy's Best Movie Outing to Date,8,18 September 2002,"Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan has had an odd time at the movies. So far 3 actors and as many directors have had a go at him, with varying degrees of success. Hunt for Red October might come up in conversations more often, but it's hard to get past the silliness of Sean Connery pretending to be Russian (and speaking worse Russian than Baldwin's American character).Clear and Present Danger is where your money belongs. One of Clancy's best Ryan efforts in print, this massive door-stop of a book was condensed by veteran scribes Steven Zallian and John Milius - how's that for a screen writing combo? - into a script that retains a lot of the original's moral complexity while making smart concessions to the blockbuster format. For a blockbuster is what you have before you, and one of the smartest ones out there, where art and commerce were combined in perfect harmony.As Ryan 2.0, Harrison Ford is perfect in the lead, and it's hard to believe at times, that Clancy didn't have him in mind when creating the character. With a narrative this fragmented, it is essential that the supporting roles be pitch perfect and across the board everyone does first-rate work, with special mention to Willem Dafoe as John Clarke and Donald Moffat at a devious commander in chief.Philip Noyce builds on his Ryan-debut Patriot Games and shows he is equally at ease with the quiet parts and the loud ones, particularly an RPG-powered car ambush centerpiece. The action beats are used sparingly but with brilliant precision.All in all, this is smart, tight, believable and expertly executed. It is that rare brainy ""action"" film that will involve you and have you hanging on the edge of your seat.",Clear and Present Danger
56,WalterFrith,Good covert story of intrigue,8,22 January 2005,"How many things go on daily in government planning that we, the public, and, frankly, the media, never find out about. This film reminds us of this factor and I liked its constant attention to corruption at the highest levels of government. We all know its there, but a constant reminder of it is a good thing.The drug angle that Jack Ryan investigates, tied in with the secret hit squad hired to bring it own, put these events on a collision course that is unpredictable, highly suspenseful and tense. Willem Dafoe's character as the mercenary is my only complaint. Not a complaint against Dafoe but how his part was under written. A little more development would have helped the story nicely.",Clear and Present Danger
57,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,Does not work for me!,6,19 June 2008,"The third installment in the cinematic incarnation of Tom Clancy's CIA analyst Jack Ryan and the second starring Harrison Ford, this follow-up to Patriot Games is a more complex, rewarding, and bolder film than its predecessor. Ford returns as Ryan, this time embroiled in a failed White House bid to wipe out a Colombian drug cartel and cover up the mess. The script, by Clancy and John Milius (Red Dawn), has an air of true adventure about it as Ryan places himself in harm's way to extract covert soldiers abandoned in a Latin American jungle. There are a couple of remarkable set pieces expertly handled by Patriot Games director Phillip Noyce, especially a shocking scene involving an ambush on Ryan's car in an alley. The supporting cast is superb, including Willem Dafoe as the soldiers' leader, Henry Czerny as Ryan's enemy at the CIA, Joaquim De Almeida as a smooth-talking villain, Ann Magnuson as an unwitting confederate in international crime, and James Earl Jones as Ryan's dying boss. The DVD release has a widescreen presentation, theatrical trailer, closed captioning, optional French soundtrack, and optional Spanish subtitles.",Clear and Present Danger
58,rollernerd,Toast or Toast?,7,29 April 2021,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is the political thriller Clear and Present Danger (1992) the next instalment to the Ryanverse series. In this flick icon legend Harrison Ford is back and this time the bad guys are in his own government. When Admiral James Greer becomes sick with cancer, Ryan is appointed acting CIA Deputy Director of Intelligence. Almost before he can draw a breath in his new position, one of the president's closest friends and his family are murdered in their sleep by what appears to by drug cartels. So, Ryan is called in to investigate and goes before the Senate to get funding for the fight on drugs. But unknown to him the CIA has already sent a secret field operative to lead an illegal cover operation force in Colombia against the Cali cartels. Things get even more complicated for Ryan when himself and his own field of ops people are set up in a routine airport pickup and he loses an agent in the field. Ryan must then risk not only his career, but his life to expose the truth behind the mystery. While Jack tries to trace the money on the laundering, things start to get out of control, political backs get covered, plausible deniability kicks in and Ryan finds himself clearly exposed and in danger. Like what I did there??This movie delivers an exciting story which drew me more and more to what was transpiring as each scene throughout the flick was intense and dramatic. The well-crafted flick is definitely an improvement from Patriot Games as it is kicks in the political thriller while displaying how corruption can go as high up within a political hierarchy.Ford does excellent again as Ryan as he plays the thinking man's action hero while also serving up his brand of moral gravitas and does well by bringing out the humanity out of the character. Now Ford has a few awesome action scenes however the two scenes he does awesome include where he goes off to get the helicopter and where he is where he is trying to hack computer files and hitting print while finding out he needs to fill up the printer. And once he manages to get what he needs, he berates and argues with his CIA counterpart Robert Ritter played by Henry Czerny is like you are watching a boxing match - intense. Henry Czerny was also great as this maligned office muppet douch who believes in results rather than collateral damage and has a sneaky get out of jail card.It would have been nice to see more of Harris Yulin who plays National Security Advisor to the President and understand his agenda and purpose on why he did what he did. To me the real standout other than Ford is Willem Dafoe who is so underused here and spends the majority of this film in his own little action movie. He is convincing as shadowy field agent John Clark and his scene with Ford in particular when each shove the door at each other is awesome and funny. Props to Miguel Sandoval who plays cartel boss Ernesto Escobedo - again it would have been nice to see more of him and understand his motives other than greed.Considering this is a 90s flick so minimal CGI, the action sequence is very cool especially the ambush scene, it might be over dramatic with the death of a character but still well set up with practical explosion. The filmmaker does well with the political intelligence and describing how doing something important on a political level isn't always black and white, its always grey and there are always collateral. The pacing of the flick was engaging while providing a mix of action and political suspense. This is a great addition to the Ryanverse however it would have been nice to allow the great cast to have more screen time such as Yulin and Dafoe which would have developed their characters more in the overall scope. Another issue I had were a few cliched moments and lines including the I don't dance line between Ford and the President. This felt more diverging into a commercial flick. Overall, an entertaining flick 7/10.",Clear and Present Danger

60,mhasheider,A so-so film that's worth watching.,8,15 February 2001,"Third installment of the Jack Ryan series takes place as Ryan (Harrison Ford) who takes over for his ailing mentor, Greer (James Earl Jones) and investigates the murders of a U.S. businessman (and his family) who was a friend of the current President (Donald Moffat) and had secret ties to a Colombian drug lord (Miguel Sandoval).  Ryan is aware that a fellow CIA employee, Cutter (Henry Czerny in a devilish performance) throws Ryan into the middle of a cover-up after a small band of U.S. soldiers and numerous innocent civilians have been killed.  Ford is okay here as Ryan, but Willem Dafoe (""Shadow of the Vampire"") manages to steal the show as John Clark, a clever and reliable field operative who originally thinks that Ryan found out about his small operation in Colombia and pulled the plug on it.  The film becomes fun to watch in the second half as Ryan, Clark, and Chavez (Raymond Cruz), a sniper bail out the remaining members of Clark's squad out of Bogota.  Overall, ""Clear and Present Danger"" is a so-so film that's worth watching.",Clear and Present Danger
61,ReelCheese,Just When You Think You Know What's Going On...,8,2 July 2007,"Just when you think you know what's going on, another wonderful twist throws you for a loop. That's what helps make CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER a standout film and the most entertaining of the Jack Ryan series.CIA analyst Harrison Ford (in vintage form here) is left in the dark on secret plans by the U.S. government to fight the fire of Colombian drug cartels with the fire of cream-of-the-crop soldiers. When the mission is aborted and the soldiers left for dead, the stage is set for an emergency rescue and tense White House confrontations that go all the way to the top.Between the taut action and the crisp storytelling by director Phillip Noyce (surely his best effort to date), there's certainly no time to be bored. And unlike far too many films with a 141-minute running time, CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER doesn't wear out its welcome. This one's an intelligent winner.",Clear and Present Danger
62,HelloTexas11,pretty good Clancy adaptation,7,11 June 2008,"'Clear and Present Danger' is full of great scenes which never really come together to make a great movie. It's trying to tell too many different stories and so, even with nearly two and half hours screen time, each story feels too short and incomplete. There are at least a half-dozen major plot threads running concurrently; give the director credit for at least TRYING to fit everything that matters in from another of Tom Clancy's super-fat bestsellers. The other problem though is Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford). He is not the action hero of 'Patriot Games.' Here, he is a dupe at first, then a decoy at the end, and in between sort of a standard-issue government official (albeit a rare honest one). John Clark (Willem Defoe) is the closest thing to a 'hero' present. There is a large ensemble cast, everyone has a role to play, and Ryan frankly is reduced to being just another member of that ensemble. In short, the US President orders (without stating so explicitly, to cover his own butt) a covert military operation against drug cartels in Colombia. Clark heads up a small, elite squad that then begins going around blowing up labs and generally disrupting the drug business. In apparent retaliation, the FBI director and his entourage are killed in their motorcade while on a visit to Bogota. A Cuban intelligence expert working for one of the drug lords approaches National Security Adviser Cutter (the president's right-hand man) for a truce, and a deal-in exchange for his cutting drug exports to the US in half, he wants the inserted military team cut off and abandoned, so he can kill them. As mentioned, there are several other side-plots (Admiral Greer has terminal cancer, an FBI secretary is seduced by the Cuban intelligence agent and murdered) so there is a lot of jumping back and forth among the various players and situations. Among the best scenes is the ambush of the FBI director's motorcade in Colombia; very well-staged and realistic, it's a real nail-biter of a sequence. But there are several other good action set-pieces as well. 'Clear and Present Danger' does not seem as long as it is. It's just too bad the director, Philip Noyce, and the trio of screenwriters couldn't make the film a more cohesive package and found better ways to pump up Ford's role. After 'The Hunt for Red October' and 'Patriot Games,' we have certainly come to expect more from the Jack Ryan character than to be a fall-guy for a slippery Prez and his corrupt underlings, even if he belatedly turns the tables on them.",Clear and Present Danger
63,buzznzipp1995,"A course of action, that he can suggest....he can't.",10,14 March 2007,"Harrison Ford. Willem Dafoe. Anne Archer. James Earl Jones. Benjamin Bratt. Henry Czerny, Harris Yulin as a 'heavy' (National Security Adviser : James Cutter ) and Dean Jones. They have a cast of old school heavies and new talent all together. I hadn't seen Dean Jones in a while and he was fantastic! There is a 'chilling weight', that scores the film visually from the onset. The director Phillip Noyce, uses broad scenery (from what I can tell) it brings out a feeling of grandness, vast and encompassing. It just sort of takes control of the mind and vision.The story of a Cartel from Columbia taking 'Liberties' on a family that wound up unbeknown to Escabedo (the Cartel scumbag) being friends of the President of The United States of America. Violent liberties that have become deadly serious. A Cali Cartel. A decision, that the President discusses with his defense secretary. A course of action that he (The President) can't suggest, is exactly what he is suggesting, behind closed doors. Being inside the White House in a Tom Clancy /Phillip Noyce film always seems very real for me, as I watch the government employees walk and talk and what ever else.This has to be one of the highest Clancy novel/ movies that I have seen, just above "" Patriot Games "". Czerny is so good at being maligned. He is the one you don't want to be in a face-off with in a CIA office. He truly brings out a roundly compelling performance as Deputy Director of the C.I.A. ' Robert Ritter' . Deception, is all around. like a sort of wall-papering. Who can Jack trust when he must? This is a powerful story and a dramatic and strong ending that completes the story from start to middle and ending. I was very enthusiastic and impressed, by the directing performance, photography and music score. The film crew that worked on 'Patriot Games' (1992) was retained for this one too. I saw an inside interview about the production of 'Clear and present danger' and the Producer stated that Harrison Ford performed his driving stunt, during the ambush!! And in regard to that beautiful drug dealer home in the country, get this...it was not 'CGI' special effects, they actually blew the house to bits!!!! Yes, it was real too. Now thats how to make a top-end action adventure/ thriller, in my book. Can you believe this, of all the Ten and twenty million dollar salaries that Ford makes in his work, he barely got paid one-million for this body of work. This is a keeper.

Kudos also to Tom Clancy, director Phillip Noyce, James Horner's fine music score and the fine cast. Veteran actors made up a terrific supporting cast: James Earl Jones as Greer in a sad scene, Willem Dafoe, Benjamin Bratt and Raymond Cruz as the U.S. military mercenaries, a quartet of despicable villains: Henry Czerny, Harris Yulin, Joaquim de Almeida, Miguel Sandoval and Donald Moffat as the President and Anne Archer as Jack's loving, understandable and supportive wife. It will be difficult to match the quality of this production in future Jack Ryan films.",Clear and Present Danger
66,dkncd,Jack is back,8,3 October 2007,"""Clear and Present Danger"" is the second adaptation of a Tom Clancy novel to feature Harrison Ford as CIA agent Jack Ryan. This film involves a murder which is linked to drug cartels in Colombia and the subsequent efforts to take action against the cartels.Harrison Ford proves again that he is well-suited to the role of Jack Ryan and more appropriate than Alec Baldwin and Ben Affleck for the role. There are some great supporting performances as well, particularly from James Earl Jones, Willem Dafoe and Henry Czerny. Henry Czerny developed an interesting character and the rivalry between him and Jack Ryan was excellent.The story of this film is better developed than that of ""Patriot Games"" (1992), which is why I prefer this film. It goes beyond a simple ""Jack Ryan combats criminals"" story. There is not a lot of intrigue per se, but some interesting turns and friction between Ryan and officials within the United States government. There are also some well-made action sequences in the film to supplement the story. The film's ending was interesting and appropriate. ""Clear and Present Danger"" proved to be more interesting than its predecessor film, ""Patriot Games"" (1992).",Clear and Present Danger
67,MovieBuff11732,Second Best Clancy Movie,9,1 December 2018,Clear And Present Danger is about Jack Ryan and the government trying to stop a company from selling drugs in coffee. They go through many tough situations to stop them.Clear and Present Danger is a great movie. The action scenes were great to watch. they got you on the edge of your seat. Harrison is an outstanding choice to play Jack Ryan. He did a great job. William Dafoe did a great job as John Clark. James Earl Jones in this movie though felt a little flat. In the first installment of this trilogy he did a way better job. The places that they filmed at were great. They made the movie seem like a true story or something really happening.Clear And Present Danger is a great movie to watch. It is a great action thriller.,Clear and Present Danger
68,Doc_Who,"Slow start, but is a thriller so the action is thoughout not the whole time!!",10,17 October 1999,"This movie is from the book by Tom Clancy . It starts out a little slow as Jack Ryan, is looking into a death of a friend of the President. Meanwhile , the drug cartels in South America as looking for ways to make the U.S pay for capturing the drug cartels  henchmen. There is also a plot of war against the cartels that ryan knows nothing about. The movie is a thriller so the action sequences are worth every moment!!My favorite sequence is the ambush , but it still a great action movie!!Eventually Ryan must go down to south america and the white house to solve the nation's problems!!If you like Tom Clancy movies,(or novels), or Harrison Ford , you will like this movie!!it is one of my all time favorite movies!!!",Clear and Present Danger

70,metalrox_2000,One of the best of the 90's,10,11 January 2010,"Clear and present danger is a simply amazing combination of old school spy thriller and action movie rolled into one. The pace is simply intelligent and the film avoids clichés.We open with the Coast Guard tracking a boat that had strayed off course. After stopping, boarding, and arresting the ""pirates"" aboard the ship, they stumble upon a crime scene.The murder victim isn't just your average citizen, he is a friend of one of the most powerful men in the world, the president of the United States, played to a statesmen effect by Donald Moffett.Spurred by the need of revenge, the plot is planned by two white house staff members, James Cutter (played by legendary character actor Harris Yulin), and Robert Ritter (played by Henry Czerny, who plays the role with the perfect blend of ruthlessness and coldness) James Earl Jones reprises his role as Adm. Greer, and Harrison Ford the role of Jack Ryan, the straight edged hero who sees the world in right and wrong. Both are simply spectacular in the roles. The film also has a good amount of name actors in supporting roles, such as Benjamin Bratt, Ann Magnuson, Williem DeFoe, Thora Birch, Joaquim De Almeida (from Despardo fame), and the late Hope Lange.As the plot unfolds, Ryan is pulled into a world that he's not completely ready to handle. He seems completely shocked that such corruption can come from the White House.On the surface, you can somewhat identify with President Bennett's need for revenge. One his best friends, along with the man's wife, and young son and daughter, who brutally murdered and tossed overboard into the sea. However, the means to which he goes borderlines on the obsessive and dangerous. His actions may lead to the deaths of several drug dealers and their counterparts, but it also leads to the deaths of several women and young children. The underlining question becomes, does the person seeking revenge become just as evil as those they seek revenge on.As Ryan is pulled into this twisted world of revenge he finds himself pushed to his own boundaries. He's nearly killed in an assassination attempt. He's caught in the middle of a coupe between a drug lord and his underlings. And he soon learns that he is as much responsible for the deaths of US Troops as those who sent them on the mission. For once, his moral view of right and wrong has led to someone's death.I think the franchise dropped off without Harrison Ford in the role of Jack Ryan. He seemed to bring the most to the table. Simply put, he was more believable in the role then the other actors who've tackled the role. Of all the Jack Ryan films, I think Patriot Games and it's sequel, Clear and Present Danger remain the best in terms of storyline, character development, and overall direction. I think that some viewers will be left at the end, wondering what will happen to Ryan, as he's testifying at the end of the film about the activities that had taken place. FRom the open to the close, the movie pulls you in, and even at slightly over two hours, the film never overstays its welcome. 10 out of 10!!!",Clear and Present Danger
71,emryse,Good Enough,7,25 July 2021,"There's not much to really be said about this film, it's a fun enough time with a pretty stellar cast comprising of the likes of Willem Dafoe, Harrison Ford and James Earl Jones, the story is interesting if somewhat complicated and all the technical aspects of the film are fine, this is the kind of film you'll watch, enjoy and then likely forget about but that's alright. For what it is this film is a fun romp, the one note I'll give is that the action in this film is pretty few and far between, not a deal breaker and there is still action it's just that if you're going in expecting loads of fighting and explosions you may be disappointed for the first half, still a decent film that can quite nicely take up an evening.",Clear and Present Danger

This time as CIA Deputy Director of Intelligence he gets caught up in an illegal war with a Columbian drug cartel putting himself and his colleagues in danger when things go horribly wrong as he investigates corruption and Government cover ups.Director Phillip Noyce handles the action sequences well but the script by Steven Zaillian and John Milius gets bogged down in trying to deal with the complexities of the novel which tends to take the wind out of the sails of the action.

74,charlessmith702210,A look into the bit of the ugly civil war involving illegal drugs in Colombia,9,13 May 2013,"Well, Harrison Ford (who plays character John Ryan) was a pretty good actor and was in a good spot to be in as Acting Director of Intelligence, this Washington job for him was going to be at a major challenge.It starts off early in the movie when Panamian boaters were smuggling a boat towards probably Columbia when the Coast Guard stopped them and forced them to a search.Then, the President of the United States (played by Donald Moffat) is informed about this and blames the Cali Cartel in Colombia for a growing threat of widespread drug-related violence that could spread to the United States, in his briefing.Then, even though there are verbal warnings about not allowing a guerrilla war involving any of the U.S. military to curb the threat of the Cail Cartel, the wheels of this secret small-scale war start to move in toward such an action. One sniper who is good is picked to join with a U.S. paramilitary army to go on what was supposed to be a secret mission to take some of the teeth out of the Colombia's Cali cartel. Then, someone from the outside goes on...the order is confirmed by Jim Greer (played by James Earl Jones), who has to stay on the outside, fighting a terminal stage of pancreatic cancer.The first part of the guerrilla war shows the paramilitary band being parachuted into Colombian territory, and then taking out a supply plane by explosives, and then, going deeper into the Columbian jungle to take out one of the Cali cartel's drug factories also by explosives. No casualties.But Miguel Sandoval (played by Ernesto Escobedo), a Cali leader, swears revenge for this. After a security convoy with John Ryan inside goes into the heart of Bogota to try to meet up with Ernesto, the convoy is greeted by Cali insurgents who fire gunshots and rocket propelled grenades at the convoy. They take out 2 convoy cars, and when American security personnel in the surviving convoy cars fire back, they do kill about 10 Cali insurgents but most of them are killed by the insurgents, and John Ryan, fortunately, survives the guerrilla attack.When John Ryan comes back to the states, a secret order is placed on the American guerrilla soldiers--to use a cellulose-encased laser guided bomb on one of the mansions who have ties to Escobedo. With spectacular special effects, the bomb does its work demolishing the house, but it was not a surgical strike--scores of people were killed even though the target was a yellow jeep parked in front of the mansion.And you think the movie ends just like that...but then, focus lies on Greer finally succumbing to death by cancer, and you see the funeral scene where he is given full military honors, and about the same time this was happening---the American guerrillas do abort a mission to take out 200 Colombian mercenaries and about to get out, they were still attacked by surprise by them. One dies, several of them are captured as POWs, and the sniper who was supposed to take the enemy out could not shoot any of them, and decides to hide in the bush.John Ryan realizes too late about the surprise attack, and decides to take a big risk to get them out. He goes overseas into the Colombian jungle himself, with help of a Colombian insider, and was able to find the lone sniper almost exactly where the surprise attack happened, and the sniper blames Ryan for causing the paramilitary fiasco, and quickly says to the sniper--""It's my fault!"" Then, more wheels are turning as the mission goes into trying to find the POWs, but John Ryan faces several hurdles in trying to rescue them. He has to get through the dangerous Felix Cortez, which he does, with the help of Ernesto Escobedo. Then Ernesto was going to kill off John but was saved by the sniper. Then blaming Ryan for the killing of Ernesto, Felix orders the surviving armed bodyguards to search and kill John, but John and the insider, along with the sniper, was able to free the several prisoners (which were located at the Lindo Coffee Factory), and go up to the roof where an awaiting helicopter was going to move them to safety. All three make it up there even though Felix Cortez and his armed bodyguards were targeting them for death as they ran to the chopper, but the sniper and the insider was able to kill some of the armed gang members off. The sniper was even able to kill the most ruthless Cortez just before the helicopter moved away from danger.Then, back at home, John laments the botched paramilitary mission to the President at the Oval Office and is about to angrily rant at him for not knowing about the scores of American dead for a war that most people should not need to know. Then, with his rant frustrated and not allowed by the President, he decides to testify towards the Senate Oversight Committee about that ""lost"" paramilitary war to get back some redemption that he can earn--even though he cannot get all of it.",Clear and Present Danger

However, for the most part, the film stays on course with alternating action, drama, and suspense scenes. Anne Archer and Thora Birch return in more forgettable roles as Ford's wife and daughter. Several other colorful characters are present, especially Joaquim de Almeida as a sinister cartel figure. Willem Dafoe plays a great role as a CIA contact, who supplies the illegal firepower to attack the cartels. His role should have been developed more; he's on screen all too briefly. James Earl Jones also returns for a farewell performance as Greer, Ryan's mentor. Henry Czerny, Harris Yulin, and Donald Moffat make up the oily triumvirate that Faces Ford. The film has terrific action and suspense sequences, especially the cartel's open attack on Ford's government convoy in the SUV's and the computer battle where Ford tries to run off illegal government doings. Ford's actions are consistent with his character, in that, he never saves the day via extraordinary means by himself, as can be customary in these type of films.",Clear and Present Danger

This is not saying much though since these movies have either been amazing or awful (yes, I'm talking about the last one).It stays true to the book, the plot development is a bit slow so you need to be patient. As true to a Clancy novel, there is no ""one guy saves the world"" type of thing here. Good people die, bad people die, neutral people die. The conclusion is bittersweet, more like a pyrrhic victory, which I like.I must admit it, getting a Tom Clancy novel in script form is not easy since his works tend to be very, very complex, with multiple sub-plots.

The second half is much better, in which we realize the scope of what's going on, and with the requisite action.James Earl Jones returns as Admiral Greer, the comic relief.

79,contronatura,Gripping and surprisingly intelligent,8,23 February 2000,"A vast improvement over Harrison Ford's first outing as Jack Ryan, Clear and Present Danger is a tightly plotted and tension-filled thriller that exceeds all expectations. Unlike Patriot Games, this film relies on intrigue more than action. Much of the action involves bureaucratic decision-making, which sounds dull but is in this film quite riveting. The action, when it does come, is very powerful. The ambush of the FBI motorcade in Colombia is a remarkable action scene - there are few action scenes that come to mind that are this tense and affecting. Harrison Ford is good as Ryan, though Willem Dafoe and Henry Czerny steal the film. Czerny plays a cold-hearted bureaucrat better than anyone who comes to mind, and he's terrific in this film. Much credit much go to director Philip Noyce for his work here. Unfortunately the film falls apart in the end, and the villainous advisor to the Colombian drug dealer is a fairly weak adversary. But this film is still very worthwhile and better than almost any other action film you're likely to see come down the Hollywood conveyor belt. 8/10",Clear and Present Danger
80,Progressive-Element,The better of Harrison's Jack Ryan films,8,26 May 2013,"While less believable than the book by having Jack involved in almost every plot point - in Tom Clancy's novel he only properly comes into the main story in the last third - it's a more satisfying experience all round than Patriot Games.Some patience is required as much of the first half is spent introducing new characters, setting up plot, etc. The investigation of a hit on a businessman and his family on a luxury yacht by a pair of hired muscle reveals connections with a Colombian drug cartel - the businessman was skimming money from them, and he and his family paid for it with their lives. The money skimmed is located, and the US government seizes it which angers the drug baron who was being scammed, Ernesto Escobedo. Escobedo's intel man, former Cuban DGI colonel Felix Cortez, sees an opportunity to seize power by having the US Ambassador, and the visiting FBI Director assassinated. Meanwhile, the CIA, without Ryan's knowledge, is running an illegal covert operation against the drug cartels, with covert troops deep in Colombia staging hit and run raids on drug factories, and secret airports used for aircraft smuggling drugs. The assassinations provoke the President into ordering things to be taken to a new lever. An aerial strike is ordered against a drug baron's mansion while he is meeting with several others, and attempts are made to pass it off as a car bombing by angry cartel members. But not only is Jack growing suspicious that his own country is doing something illegal, Cortez also is becoming alert to the fact the US government is running a secret operation in a supposedly friendly nation.When Cortez blackmails a senior US official into giving him the locations of the US troops in Colombia, Jack, with the help of a shadowy field agent called John Clark - Willem Dafoe - takes matters into his own hands.Convoluted to be sure, but a thoroughly intriguing political thriller, with great action sequences, particularly the RPG attack on the convoy in Bogota. The climactic rescue sequence is rather weak compared to the more epic version in the book, more akin to a 12-rated Rambo movie, but it works well in itself. The showdown with the President provides plenty of sparks - I AM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES - though the ending departs considerably from the book.",Clear and Present Danger

His first assignment: Investigate the murders of one of the president's friends, a prominent U.S. businessman with secret ties to Colombian drug cartels. Unbeknownst to Ryan, the CIA has already dispatched a deadly field operative (Willem Dafoe) to lead a paramilitary strike force against the Colombian drug lords. Caught in the crossfire, Ryan takes matters into his own hands, risking his career and life for the only cause he still believes in - the truth.My Spiel: This is my favorite of the Tom Clancy style war books turned to movies. Granted I like Hunt for the Red October. But the style of this is something else. This in my eyes is a true classic, of a man getting caught in a situation way bigger then he can explain at first. In the styles of the Patriot Games. This has a major one up on that. When the strike force team move in to Colombian territories commanded by Willem Dafoe's character. Also to the character Jack Ryan getting thrown / Betrayed into a conspiracy to send troops to stop the drug trafficking and cartel, and then uncovers the truth, and wants nothing more then to get those troops out after they were sold out. This is a action packed movie from beginning to end with the assault on the Suburban scene and every scene with the paramilitary strike force team.

Ford is okay, but there's really not a lot to work with in the character of Jack Ryan.  He's not complex enough to be interesting or believable as an intelligence agent, and he's not cartoonish enough to be fun like James Bond.  He could use a sense of humor, that's for sure.  His earnest, goody-two-shoes act gets old by the end of the film.  The story concerns the murky world of politics, intelligence agencies, and the connections between governments, businesses and drug cartels, but instead of developing characters as complex as the situation, the director/writer deliver up cliched good guys and bad guys.  Very disappointing that way. 
At least it's better than Patriot Games, where the writing was even worse. But it's not as good as The Hunt for Red October.  If you want a simplistic action film, this will probably fit the bill, though it may seem slow at times, especially in the first half.

Captain Red Wegener, who's described in the book as a living legend and his crew who decide to fake an execution in order to get both killers (Ramon&Jesus) to talk are missing in the movie. Instead, he's been replaced by a young woman as captain! This is once again typically Hollywood. Pushing women into every possible role without any sort of originality or reality.Dan Murray and Mark Bright from FBI work on the case of yacht homicide from the beginning. It's not Jack Ryan.The background story of Chavez and his hispanic companions like Vega is non existent.Moira and Cathy (Jack's wife) never meet each other. In fact there are not many words about Cathy Ryan in the original story other than she's a doctor and a few dialogues. Once again, typically Hollywood. Trying to feed the audience that a woman is behind a successful man. No, it's not necessary always the case.Moira doesn't get killed by Cortez. She commits suicide (which she survives) after director Jacobs's assassination after realizing she's been been misused by Cortez.Dan Murray doesn't get killed in Bogota. It's only Jacobs. In fact he and Jack Ryan aren't even there at all. Jack Ryan spends the half of story in Europe on a conference.Escobedo IS the man behind that assassination out of naivety or stupidity.The story on captain PJ, Zimmer or Bronco are non existent.There is no woman sitting in congress bossing Jack Ryan. Typically Hollywood once again putting women in important roles.The state attorney (Davidoff) and the lawyer (Stuart) of the two yacht murders are non existent. Also their assassination in the prison by the twin brothers Pattersons.It's not Chavez who's with Clack marking the car bomb. It's Larson who is completely missing in this movie.Agent Fowler? First, Fowler is a man. Second, he is the presidential candidate. Hollywood lolWhere is Bobby Jackson who actually leaks the infos of the secret operation to Ryan?The guy from the bar? Who was that? Makes absolutely no sense.Chavez is not the only survivor. In fact there are no prisoners and Captain Ramirez gets killed in the combat.Jack Ryan never goes to Escobedo trying to sort out a deal with him. - Escobedo doesn't die in a shooting. He is delivered to M19.There is no sabotage of Ritter's computer.Those final battles are completely invented. Cortez doesn't die. They deliver him to Cuban with Moira watching!There are just too many important passages of the original book missing in this movie.

The movie moves at a good linear pace and the way the events are set up is great.Besides the suspense there is the action and this movie has one of the most exciting ambush scenes I have ever seen. This is one of Ford's best, no doubt. Willam Dafoe plays Clark to whom Ryan finds himself liable. What makes the heroism of the characters plausible is the strong integrity they possess. This is one movie no one should miss",Clear and Present Danger

Of all the Clancy books, this remains my favorite and I was highly disappointed with how it was handled, mostly because it made future sequels all but impossible to make without increasing the chasm between the two mediums.  Great characters from this book and future stories are either changed completely or killed off.  That is tough to ignore.As for the movie as a standalone vehicle, it was decent.  Nothing really new to be found in it.  Things just seem a little too predictable (even the original material that wasn't in the book) and cliche Hollywood.",Clear and Present Danger
96,Agaric,"Intelligent, yet Laborious at times",7,11 January 2004,"WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS     ""Clear and Present Danger"" is the third translation of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan series to the screen, and the second one starring Harrison Ford as the ""thinking-man's James Bond"".  Although a definite improvement over ""Patriot Games"", and on par with ""The Hunt for Red October"", the film contains serious points of lag.  The material in these drawn out sequences is interesting, but it molds the film into an average entry in either of two categories: either as a tepid action film, or an underdeveloped drama. Holes aside, the film is engaging enough to wet the appetites of fans of either genre, and is an entertaining experience overall.     Ford is the best Jack Ryan in my opinion, successfully conveying Ryan's intelligence as well as his vulnerability in dangerous situations.  Plus he is able to inject his trademark charm and snide humor into the role which gives the character a more down-to-earth character we can relate to.  Part of the problem with the movie is the lack of development of the rest of the characters.  Since the script is burdened with an array of important roles, their screen time is often marginalized.  For example, Willem Dafoe is given hardly any development prior to the climax of the film.  I respect Dafoe as an actor greatly, and found myself wishing that he would be involved in more of the film.  Anne Archer has the throwaway role as the wife of Jack Ryan, but James Earl Jones is able to shine as Admiral Greer, even though he's on the sidelines.  Some characters just don't fit, like the entire cabinet of political bigwigs who orchestrate the events of the movie.  Donald Moffat is ridiculous and an utter buffoon of a president, and Henry Czerny seems to be insidious for no reason.  Many of these holes in characters could have been remedied with another half hour of screen time.     However, my last comment would have shifted the context of the movie to a full blown drama.  As much as Clancy's work is engaging, the movie cannot stand on its own without the promise of action.  The action scenes are well done and gripping at times, but they are merely peppered throughout the film.  Philip Noyce is able to create scenes of tension without using weapons, such as the well-done scene involving a computer battle between Ford and Czerny.  Overall, the film gives off an odor stemming from a lack of sustained tension, and the plot visibly loses steam at points.     Ultimately, the main problem with ""Clear and Present Danger"" is the problem of defining what it ""clearly"" is as a movie.  But, if you're a fan of Clancy's work or are just looking for an entertaining movie, give this one a rent.",Clear and Present Danger
97,goggy turk,Condensed Clancy,7,8 April 2000,"The makers of this movie are to be congratulated for turning a Tom Clancy doorstop into a tense, tightly woven international thriller with a top notch cast and believeable plot. Where the previous two Jack Ryan movies depended on stunts and quite unbelieveable plot twists this film concentrates on a grubby little military/political incident (more the domain of intelligence men) and the men of honour and integrity (Ford and an under used Dafoe) trapped in the middle of it.I also like this movie for its subtle dig at the American establishment and how it assumes it can coerce the weak into doing its bidding.The Clark character in Clancy's fiction is an interesting one and deserves to be further developed. Casting Willem Dafoe in the part was actually a stroke of genius, and I could easily imagine his character in Platoon doing this kind of work if he had survived Vietnam. The fact that Dafoe is one of THE most underrated actors in Hollywood also means I like this.",Clear and Present Danger

100,Craig87-1,"Ryan, The Drug Cartels, And CIA Abuse",9,10 September 2009,"The third installment in the cinematic series based on Tom Clancy's CIA analyst Jack Ryan, CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER is a long but engrossing political action thriller that once again puts Harrison Ford, the thinking man's action film actor, in the role of Ryan. This time around, Ford investigates the murder of a close friend of the President (Donald Moffatt) by Colombian drug cartel hit men. When his mentor (James Earl Jones) falls ill due to pancreatic cancer, Ford is suddenly put in charge as deputy director of the CIA. He continues his investigation of the murders and ties them in with one particular drug cartel leader (Miguel Sandoval) with whom the murdered man had a little issue with ill-gotten money,.... But what Ford doesn't know is that, on orders from the revenge-minded Moffatt, his second deputy (Henry Czerny) and the president's national security adviser (Harris Yulin) have ordered a rogue officer named Clark (Willem Dafoe) in with a covert military team to put a huge dent in the cartel's activities. Dafoe and his team are successful at what they do, but the cartels retaliate with deadly results on Ford's friends in the FBI during a visit to Bogota. And when Ford finds out about the operation, he finds himself going down to Colombia a second time to help spirit Dafoe and the covert team out of harm's way. Ably directed, once more, by Phillip Noyce (DEAD CALM; PATRIOT GAMES), CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER gives Ford another chance to prove his mettle in the action genre. The suspense and CIA intrigue are all laid out exceptionally well by Noyce and his first-rate cadre of screenwriters, Donald Stewart, Steven Zaillian, and John Milius. Jones is at his usual best as the now-dying Admiral Greer, and Anne Archer returns as Ford's wife. But a performance really worth noting here is Czerny's as the unconsciously corrupt CIA deputy director Robert Ritter. About as uncouth and conniving a heavy as there has ever been in the movies, his performance is absolutely chilling and believable. It makes the whole notion of our government going beyond reasonable bounds even more credible than it already is. Some will object to the film not pandering to Clancy's right-wing political points of view or his gung-ho pro-military stance, but that isn't necessarily what this movie is about. It does not condemn covert military action, but it does question the wisdom of sending men into a war zone where the risks are extreme, the reasons for such actions are vague at best, and there is no clear exit strategy. Such points are made extremely well in this film's action format; and for those reasons, it gets the highest marks.",Clear and Present Danger
101,eroblesp,Terrible adaptation of a great novel,2,30 December 2004,"I had read the novel before, so I had high hopes on the film. I was so disappointed. The film not only botches the book quite badly, but has errors of its own :*** Possible spoilers ****The whole point of assembling a special ops team of soldiers from Latino origin, was to make them difficult to identify as US forces. However, they happily yell in clear English on all combat scenes. Willem Dafoe as Clark is a TERRIBLE miscast. The character is always depicted as a tall, broad shouldered person. (Liev Schreiber is also a bad choice for the same role on Sum of All Fears).Almost all roles on the book are changed beyond recognition : CIA Dep. Dir. Robert Ritter is not the bad guy depicted on the movie; FBI Dir. Jacobs and Agent Murray are both killed on the movie (they are important characters on next novels); on the novel, James Cutter kills himself by walking in front of a bus.The soldiers persecution on the jungle seems like a bunch of scared kids running from a gang; the novel depiction of tactics and ambush scenes are FAR superior. And of course, the inevitable final up-close-and-personal fight between Ryan and Cortez : guess what, never happened on the book, since Ryan never gets off the Blackhawk rescue helicopter (not the puny Bell from the movie), because he is busy manning a machine gun. It seems that Hollywood thinks that a movie is incomplete without a ""heroic"" fist fight (the same issue that completely botched the ending of Patriot Games). Originally, Cortez is left alive on the backyard of one of the surviving drug lords : THAT is a punishment!! In all, the movie not only presents a simplistic plot of bad guy-good guy, but ignores completely a much more complex conspiracy and anti-drug operation. This film had all the ingredients to be just great, but you get just cartoonist bad guys, a couple of good action scenes and a laughable ending.",Clear and Present Danger
102,wolf1282,"Not perfect, but clearly good.",7,27 January 2007,"Having read Tom Clancy's book, I noticed many differences with the movie (Cortez and Moira die in the movie, there is only one covert team in the movie instead of four in the book, Ritter is portrayed much more despicably in the movie, etc). I did not have a problem with most of these; the lone exception involved the death of Dan Murray in the movie. The only problem: In Clancy's later works, he becomes FBI Director Murray. So, who will conduct the seance for the next movie? Also, a language problem occurs in the film. Before I get to that, now is a good time for me to point out the show-stealers of the film, the bad guys. Yes, Harrison Ford turns in a quality performance, but Joaquim de Almeida (Cortez) and Miguel Sandoval (Ernesto Escobedo, the drug lord) are 100% believable, Escobedo as a reckless, scared bully and Cortez as a smooth-talking double-crosser who will eliminate anyone in his way. Now, on to the language problem: At the beginning of the movie, Cortez and Escobedo speak to each other in Spanish. Then, inexplicably, they resort to English for the rest of the movie. Even the guards at Escobedo's gate speak to each other in English when Ryan comes to see Escobedo. Cortez, when he yells to Escobedo's men that Ryan has killed Escobedo (it was Cortez's bodyguard), speaks to Escobedo's men in English. Message to the director: There are subtitles. You used them at the beginning of the movie. You should have continued this usage. Overall, though, the film is well-done, and I watch it whenever I catch it on television.",Clear and Present Danger

105,Henrik-17,Good movie - but also disappointing,5,29 January 1999,"This is a typical case where being an avid fan of the author turns out to be a problem when seeing the movie.I have read - and reread - the books of Tom Clancy many times, and have always been intrigued by his use of details, without making them boring. I have read the book Clear and Present Danger many times, and will probably read it again at a later time, I have also seen the movie, and will probably not see it again.To put things right - it is a fabulous movie exciting and keeps you in suspense at all times, and, if I didn't know the books, I would rate it an 8 or 9. If you havn't read the Jack Ryan series, really - go see it and you won't be disappointed.Now unfortunately this is what comes from knowing the books.1. The characters in the movie are much too weak in comparison to the book2. The film ends in Impeachment of the President, in the books he throws the election in order to spare the country the scandal, also knowing that an impeachement will reveal that he has actually initiated an undeclared war with - and invaded - an ally, Columbia.3. Clark (and this is where I almost left the movie) is portrayed by Willem Dafoe, who does a credible job, given the material he has to work with. Willem Dafoe is completely wrong for the part. Clark is described in the books as 6'3"", broad of shoulders, muscular and a former Navy Seal, a physical description that all will agree does NOT fit Willem Dafoe. Clark in the books is an active agent of the CIA operations directorate, he is not retired, and most of the time he is either in the States or Panama, overseeing the operation. He only sets foot in Columbia at the very end. In the movie he is portrayed as an ex mercenary with a grudge living in Bogota.One of the reasons I was awaiting this movie was that I couldn't wait to see how Clark would be portrayed, and never have I seen such a misrepresentation of character.My rating of this movie is a low 5, although I admit to being colored by my disappointment of the character representations",Clear and Present Danger

115,Scientician,It continues to be relevant,9,9 March 2008,"Clancy is sometimes critiqued for being so unapologetically pro-American and specifically pro-Military. He is fond of show-casing all aspects of the US defense machinery operating at peak efficiency; a piece of information is gathered by some technical tool of spying, analyzed quickly and accurately by smart dedicated analysts, put in the hands of policy makers who make sound judgments for follow up by unfailingly courageous and outstandingly trained US military personnel, who strike with pinpoint accuracy.It is almost always a ""best case"" scenario of how US defense and security operations are supposed to work.This movie stands out for acknowledging some of the dark side of this, and explicitly rejecting the thinking behind operations like Iran-Contra, which are done outside of constitutional and legal frameworks solely on the say-so of a President or some of his subordinates. However highly Clancy may think of the US military, he demonstrates his rejection of theories of extreme Presidential powers to conduct any and all operations deemed to be for ""national defense."" Further, he acknowledges how ambitious officials up to and including the President can misuse the vast powers of the US military and intelligence agencies for personal and political gain while ignoring vital checks and balances of the US system.Speaking as one who enjoys Clancy's writing and his meticulous research into specific details of how these technologies and agencies operate, I also feel sometimes that it is simply too idealistic and overstates the utility and necessity of the vast US defense budget. So it is nice to see Clancy still respecting the core democratic values of the US system unlike so many in today's political environment who believe in essentially unlimited and illimitable Presidential authority, and that America can do no wrong.",Clear and Present Danger

In the book Jack Ryan does not find out the connection to the drug cartel until after the covert operation began because he never had a briefing with the President because the President had already made a statement of Clear and Present Danger. Ryan never meets Clark until after Escobedo's was bombed from an aerial strike. The movie also left out Samuel Jackson's character(Robby) out of the movie when he was a major part in the book discovering about the Covert Operation in Columbia.

128,pslaught,clear and present danger background and commentary,7,5 May 2005,"In the 1980s, the United States, as well as many of its neighboring Latin American nations, began to feel the affects of the Columbian drug trade. Columbia was home to the Medellín and Cali drug cartels, both of which were deeply involved in the production and distribution of cocaine. The nation profited from the drug trade, as the cartels made lucrative gains by means of its unofficial protection from the Columbian government. The United States was especially accessible to the Columbian drug trade, as both coasts could be reached with relative ease. While the United States infiltrated Central American nations in attempts to tinker with the regional politics, there is no documented evidence of American presidents authorizing covert entries and operations into Columbia The action film Clear and Present Danger, deals with the issue of the American war on drugs, however, a large portion of the plot action takes place in Columbia. The film begins aboard a large white yacht with the death of an American family. The paterfamilias of the deceased family happens to be a close friend of the President of the United States. At this point, viewers are introduced to the hero, CIA analyst and family man Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford), who has been promoted to the position of Deputy Director of Intelligence, a position he inherits from his Agency mentor, Admiral James Greer (James Earl Jones). The film then moves to the Presidents issuing of an order to assemble a team of elite Hispanic commandos to infiltrate Columbia and wage a silent war on drugs. Here the audience first meets John Clark (Willem Dafoe), a mysterious black ops veteran who will train and lead the team of soldiers in Columbia. His soldiers are later dropped into the Columbian jungle where they begin their campaign with Dafoe running as their control officer from the city, reporting back to Bob Ritter, CIA's Deputy Director of Operations.The plot twist comes in the form of a man named Felix Cortez, a Cuban intelligence officer turned mercenary who serves as the intelligence officer for the cartel in the film. After a cartel meeting is bombed by an American jet, Cortez travels to the United States, where he begins to extract information through an illicit affair with the head of the FBI's secretary, Moira Wolfe. While on a romantic weekend trip, he discovers that the United States bombed the meeting, thus ending his need for the woman. He kills her and proceeds to blackmail the National Security Adviser, James Cutter, into cutting communications with the American soldiers. Jack Ryan discovers the whole operation while at the CIA, confronts Ritter, and then goes to Columbia to save them. When he arrives, he meets up with John Clark, who, under the belief that Ryan discontinued the communications, ties him up and nearly kills him. The two men then embark on a journey to find the soldiers, and eventually find Ding Chavez, hiding alone near a jungle stream since his comrades have all been shot or captured. These three then storm Cortez' compound to rescue the other soldiers and make their subsequent escape.While Clear and Present Danger is an entertaining film, it wildly strays from the novel on which it is based. Tom Clancy's storyline is much more in depth then the plot line of the movie. Some stark differences between the two include the deaths of Dan Murray and Moira Wolfe. In the film, Dan Murray is killed on a trip to Columbia that nearly results in the death of Jack Ryan as well. Dan Murray, according to Clancy's novel, is simply an up-and-coming FBI agent and friend of Ryan's. The FBI personality murdered in Columbia in the novel is Emil Jacobs, Director of the FBI. In the movie, Moira Wolfe's apparent death violently betrays the novel, for not only does she live, the novel ends with Ms. Wolfe traveling to Guantanamo Bay to see her ""lover"" Cortez, being escorted into the prison gates and eventually handed over to Cuban authorities.",Clear and Present Danger
129,ross-webber,Greatest Action Thriller Ever,10,18 August 2005,"I forgot I had this film until recently. When I realised I had it only on video and saw the special edition DVD in the shops I knew I had to by it. This is a great film with lots of twist and you really feel for Jack Ryan's character throughout( Played outstandingly by Harrison Ford). Great back up cast Anne Archer, Willem Dafoe and James Earl Jones. Clear has all the gun ho feel to it with all the twists and turns you would expect from a thriller and contains some of the most edge of your seat set pieces I have seen in that period films (1994). I especially love the conversation Jack's Character has at the end with the President( President To Jack ""The old platonic two step?"" Jack To President ""Mr President I don't Dance!"". Watch the film to see how poignant and unforgettable these words are . Enjoy!",Clear and Present Danger
130,imdb-9834,A Colombian's point of view,5,1 October 2005,"---THIS MAY CONTAIN SMALL SPOILERS, READ AT YOUR OWN RISK--This movie is quite believable. The plot I mean. The bad guys are there too, and the drug cartels life is in some way accurate. But it has a lot of disappointing details. Small details, like: - The president of the U.S. being emotional and taking a personal vendetta? - Isn't it naive to pretend to win a war against drugs with a commando force and taking down some drug lords? - Hollywood's ability to investigate and simulate real locations is frankly embarrassing. The have an ability to make fool of themselves for erratic representations and show their big ignorance with the way they show life in underdeveloped places. Bogota is characterized as a dusty, hot and poor city. Bogota is not dusty, not ugly and is cold. I've never seen places even close to the ones showed in the movie. They shoot in places in Mexico, but guys: Not everything below the great river looks like Mexico. Not every Colombian is a drug dealer, as I guess not every American is a junkie or an ignorant, neither stupid. But if we take what Hollywood shows looks that way. They might shoot the Bogota scenes in Mexico City, it is a lot more similar to the real Bogota. -You can see soldiers everywhere you go to. They show Bogota as a place where you can get killed by a sniper in any minute. Far away from the real thing, taking off the credibility of the movie, and also creating a false and erratic image of a whole country. - This lack of investigation from people involved in the representation of tropical countries is not new, and not over. ""The fockers"" is even more embarrassing, show a even bigger ignorance of how a country really is. For a production costing several millions of dollars, they might take the hassle to investigate a little more (at least investigate) and not to make fool of themselves. -A high rank CIA officer going to the jungle to rescue some soldiers and fist-figthing drug lords? Come on!And for the record: paramilitaries, guerrillas and Colombian soldiers use nice uniforms, in some way very similar to the U.S. soldier's ones. After all, those uniforms are made here too.. ;). And drug lords don't use bodyguards with cheap formal suits. They dress casual and classy too. Military Police uniforms were accurate, at least something good. Like it was said in the first part of the movie: ""as long as there are consumers, the will be someone providing you drugs, no matter where they come from"". That's why I liked the movie, it is a realistic story. Not very well represented (at least the Colombian part), but I've seen worst.",Clear and Present Danger
