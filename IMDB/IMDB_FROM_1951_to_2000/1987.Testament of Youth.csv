0,Leofwine_draca,"Solid retelling, but not much depth",6,16 November 2018,"TESTAMENT OF YOUTH is the latest filmed version of the memoirs of Vera Brittain, who charts her life story during the First World War. It's a tale of romance and foreboding, of warfare and peace, of healing and nursing, all tied up in a searching narrative. From the trailers I was expecting this to be heavy on trench scenes, but the war material is quite scarce and usually kept off-screen; the focus very much is on Brittain herself. The film has the visual quality and measured pacing of a typical BBC drama adaptation, and there's no faulting the attention to detail. I did like the way that it doesn't shy away from the darker psychological aspects of the story. The supporting cast is fine, and Alicia Vikander is okay as the protagonist, but not entirely sympathetic; you never feel like there's much going on inside her head.",Testament of Youth
1,SnoopyStyle,Vikander wins me over,7,7 April 2016,"Vera Brittain (Alicia Vikander) wants to go to Oxford but her parents (Dominic West, Emily Watson) wants her to look for a husband. Her brother Edward (Taron Egerton), and friends Victor Richardson (Colin Morgan) and Roland Leighton (Kit Harington) all adore her. Vera falls for Roland and gets accepted to Somerville College, Oxford. As WWI approaches, her guys all volunteer. She convinces her father to let Edward enlist. She defers college and volunteers to be a nurse.It has a slow period-piece start. It's got a nice hazy moody feel. Vikander is great but the guys need more exposition. They don't have enough space to show their characters. It's a slow burn and it's all concentrated on Vikander. She wins me over slowly. She has great sadness. It has very poignant moments especially in the later parts.",Testament of Youth
2,Prismark10,Handsome adaptation but too safe,5,19 February 2017,"Author Vera Brittain's daughter was Education Secretary for the the Labour government of the late 1970s. I was actually at school during that time and I guess some of her mother's radicalism had passed off to Shirley Williams. It is probably important to mention this, because these days when you portray a petulant female standing up for equality in the early part of the twentieth century there are always accusations of political correctness gone mad. Vera Brittain's legacy is more than just her autobiographical novel which this film is based on.We see Vera Brittain (Alicia Vikander) fighting with her father to apply for a place at Oxford University, he tells her that he cannot afford it. She is surprised that she is offered a place but her female tutor makes it clear that women are expected to be a lot better than the men to get on at Oxford.As soon as Vera enters university, Britain enter the Great War and there is initial excitement between Vera, her brother Edward, her boyfriend, Roland Leighton and other mutual friends. Many of them want to their bit for the country and enlist, Vera again pesters her parents to allow Edward to join the army and she also takes a break from her studies to become a nurse.These young men mainly around 20 years old perished or got injured in the war. Her fiancé Roland she finds out did not die quickly and painlessly as the note from the army said but struggled with his wounds for hours and without morphine.After the war is over Vera returns to her studies but is despondent to the misery and deaths caused by the war. The real life Vera Brittain became a pacifist.Although the book written in 1933 recounts the horrors of the Great War, the problem with the film is the death of thousands of young men is nothing new as it has been done many times now on film and television. It is an admirable period adaptation of the book but also rather safe and anaemic.",Testament of Youth
3,kosmasp,Fighting for a cause,7,1 March 2016,"Though fighting might not be the right word. The movie also seems to go a completely different direction at first, with the now Oscar winning actress in the front row. It remains about her and her feelings throughout, but you might think it would concentrate on another aspect of life. On the other hand, when war happens, everything else seems to not matter anymore. Even things you fought very hard for.Some decisions are not understandable, especially the way they are ""explained"" by the characters, but irrational thinking does hit us from time to time. The question is, if we can bounce back from mistakes (or if we're allowed to). This also shows how grim war can be and what toll it takes, especially from the young (as the song goes: ""War? What is it good for? Absolutely nothing""). Powerful performances make this a drama that is worth a watch",Testament of Youth
4,Sleepin_Dragon,A heartbreaking snapshot of true life events,10,7 October 2015,"This magical film focuses on the diaries of the noted writer Vera Brittain. Vera battles against all objections to win a post at Oxford university, studying English literature at Somerville Cottage. War breaks out, and all those close around her sign up to fight, including her love Roland, wanting to help and make a difference she turns her back on Oxford and becomes a nurse. The War had heartbreaking consequences for so many, Vera included.The film boasts an utterly wonderful cast, it's no wonder that there are some fabulous performances, Alicia Vikander is utterly sensational as Vera, watching this film you'd never in your dreams believe she was Swedish, her RP English is incredible. I've been a life long fan of Miranda Richardson, and she doesn't disappoint, she truly is a national treasure. Colin Morgan is excellent as Victor, one scene in particular was incredibly moving.The period detail is impeccable, the buildings, decor, fashions, hairstyles etc, all is as it should be, it certainly looks the part.The scenes in France are so sad, very distressing, but painfully real I imagine. You'd need to be made of granite not to feel something.There is a huge switch in tone in the film, the first 40 minutes are gentle, almost idyllic, but as War strikes there's a shift, it's almost purposely slow to begin.It's a fabulous film, one that totally draws you in, I found it extremely engaging. Beautifully acted, you will need your hankies, not ashamed to admit I cried. 9/10",Testament of Youth
5,morrison-dylan-fan,Youth Testament.,10,29 January 2016,"With a poll taking place on IMDb's Classic Film board for the best titles of 2015,I started to look around for movies to view from the year.Being very impressed by Alicia Vikander's performances in Ex_Machina & The Danish Girl,I was delighted to discover that Netflix UK has put another of Vikander's 2015 offerings on their site,which led to me getting ready to read the testament.The plot:England 1914-Ignoring her parents remarks that she has no chance of getting in, Vera Brittain applies for a place at Oxford University. Believing she has little chance of getting in,Brittain is surprised to receive an invite from the University. Thrilled at getting in,Brittain starts a blossoming romance with Roland Leighton,whilst her brother Edward and friends Victor Richardson and Geoffrey Thurlow celebrate Brittain getting into university.As Brittain enters Oxford,news starts to spread that Archduke Franz Ferdinand has been assassinated.Feeling that they all must go and protect their country,Roland,Victor and Geoffrey decide to join the army.Hearing doubts from her mum and dad,Brittain gives Edward all her support in going to war. Taking a break from studying to become a nurse,Brittain soon discovers the truth behind ""The Great War.""View on the film:Backed by a silk score from Max Richter,director James Kent & cinematographer Rob Hardy (who also worked on Ex_Machina) give the film a beautiful water colour appearance,with the light brushing of misty blues,yellows and browns giving the movie a faded photo atmosphere.Capturing Brittain gradually get a sense of doubt over, ""The Great War"" Kent & Hardy casts bursts of dazzling bright light across the film,which burnt out as the horrors of war hit home.Whilst blood from the injured soldiers is shown,Kent takes great care in making sure that the focus is on Brittain's reaction to the horrific number of deaths,as stylish, extreme close-ups capture the sorrow and anger running across Brittain's face.Based on Brittain's autobiography,the screenplay by Juliette Towhidi gives everyone in Brittain's life their moment to shine,from Victor being buried in the full horror of war,to a very touching holding of fingers revealing Roland Leighton's love for Brittain.Caught up in the middle of WWI,Towhidi superbly balances the opening buds of tragedy and sorrow which strike Brittain with a rich determined personality which builds as Brittain raises her voice against the war.Coming into the film as a replacement for Saoirse Ronan,the gorgeous Alicia Vikander gives an excellent performance as Brittain. Revealing the love for Roland Leighton in a quiet,tender manner,Vikander brilliantly displays a determined inner strength within Brittain by giving her body language a petite,fragile presentation which is neatly countered by Vikander's expressive face showing Brittain trying to remain strong for the fallen.Joining Vikander, Kit Harington gives the film a shot of dashing,sweet-face charm as Leighton,and Colin Morgan makes the aftershock of war hit home in his wonderful,worn down performance of Victor,as they all read from the testament of youth.",Testament of Youth
6,gradyharp,Morituri te salutamus,10,25 December 2015,"Vera Brittain's pacifist autobiography is brought to the screen by Juliette Towhidi, directed by James Kent, and acted by a superb cast of some of England's finest actors – both experienced and fresh. The result is a graphic depiction of the horrors of World War I (which becomes all wars for those of us who have served), the agonies of losing loved ones on the battlefield, the sustenance of hope in the face of the unimaginable, and the pain and joy of youth becoming adults – somehow very well connected in this visually stunning and moving film.We are in England before the outbreak of WW I observing the very bright and headstrong 'pre-suffragette' Vera Brittain (a radiant and sensitive Alicia Vikander) focus her attention on getting into Oxford in a period when women had to struggle much harder than men to gain an advanced education. We also become involved with the family (father Dominic West, mother Emily Watson, and bother Edward Taron Egerton) as well as colleagues Victor (Colin Morgan) and new paramour Roland Leighton (Kit Harrington). Vera passes entrance exams but her triumph at being accepted into Oxford is tarnished by the outbreak of WW I and the gradual loss of her lover, friends, and bother to the deaths on the battlegrounds of France. She leaves Oxford, becomes a volunteer nurse and singularly survives the war – but without the men of her life whom she cherishes.The bleak and senseless monster – war – with whom we still struggle daily is raw and bitterly cruel and the manner in which it is depicted rings of Wilfred Owens's poetic descriptions. Some will say it is a sanguine film: those who have lived through such times will ache that we have yet to learn that war is not a solution. Highly recommended for the sensitive and for those who need to be sensitized.",Testament of Youth
7,malcolmgsw,Disappointing screen version of famous book,5,20 January 2015,"I have read Testament Of Youth and fully understand how Britaain's views changed so much during the course of the war.Unfortunately this film comes out rather like one of the costume dramas that the BBC is so good at showing on a Sunday evening.Too much of the film relies on description.Virtually nothing of the Trenchs other than a few shots with mud and a few extras lying around.What is of interest is the fact that Brittain kept on with her pacifism into the second world war.Now whilst I fully understand the reasons behind it I doubt that she was aware of the irony.The fact being that she lived in a country which allowed her to have freedom of speech,whilst if she had been living in Germany in the war she would have been executed.Maybe her guilt from her action at the beginning of the First World War drove her on.",Testament of Youth
8,JamesHitchcock,The Woman's Viewpoint,8,6 February 2015,"Vera Brittain's ""Testament of Youth"", an autobiographical memoir of her service as a nurse in the First World War, was controversial when it first appeared in 1933, largely because it was written from a pacifist viewpoint and rejected the official British position that we had been fighting a ""just war"" against German aggression. It was, however, also extremely popular and has never been out of print since. What gave it its popularity was Brittain's ability to describe both the horrors she had witnessed and her own personal sense of loss. Her fiancé Roland Leighton, her brother Edward and two close friends, Victor Richardson and Geoffrey Thurlow, were all killed in battle. The story was turned into a memorable television series, with Cheryl Campbell in the leading role, in the early eighties, and now has become a film, doubtless because of the interest in the war sparked by last year's centenary celebrations. The film opens in 1914, just before the outbreak of war. Vera is a young woman from a well-to-do family who is hoping to study at Oxford University, despite the opposition of her father. Like many men of the period, he believes firmly that women's place is in the home as a wife and mother and that no man will want to marry a ""bluestocking"", as he dismissively calls female intellectuals. Eventually, however, he relents and allows Vera to sit the entrance examination. By the time she arrives in Oxford, however, war has broken out and Vera, who initially reacts with patriotic enthusiasm, believes that she needs to do something to aid the war effort. Postponing her studies, she volunteers to serve as an army nurse. What she sees on the battlefields of France shakes her conviction that the war is some grand heroic enterprise. There is a suggestion that her conversion to pacifism may partly have been motivated by guilt. Although her father may have been ultra-conservative in other respects, he was opposed to the war, which he correctly foresaw would be long and bloody, and tried to dissuade Edward from volunteering, only relenting as a result of Vera's entreaties. When Edward was subsequently killed, Vera felt herself to have been partly responsible. Compared to the TV serial, which was broadcast in several episodes, the film of necessity has to condense or omit much of the material from the original book. There is, for example, no mention of the period Vera spent working in Malta. Some parts of her story were rewritten for the sake of dramatic licence; contrary to what is shown here, for example, she did not meet her future husband George Catlin until after the war. Nor did she receive news of Roland's death on what was to have been their wedding day. Some rewriting, however, is normally inevitable whenever a book, particularly one as long as ""Testament of Youth"", is adapted for the cinema. (Those who adapt books for television, with more time at their disposal, can afford to be more faithful).The film-makers were fortunate to have an actress as gifted as the lovely Alicia Vikander in the main role, bringing out Vera's compassion as well as her determination. Congratulations are also due to Alicia on her perfect English accent. While watching the film, in fact, I never suspected that she was not British by birth. It was only later that I discovered she is actually Swedish. The story of the trenches of the First World War has become a familiar one over the last hundred years, immortalised not only in history books but also in countless memoirs, novels, poems, paintings, films and television programmes. Most of those, however, were told from a male viewpoint, normally the viewpoint of the men who actually did the fighting. A film like this one is valuable because it gives us a woman's point of view. 8/10",Testament of Youth
9,Hellmant,"An excellent leading lady performance, from Vikander!",8,13 January 2016,"'TESTAMENT OF YOUTH': Four Stars (Out of Five)A British biographical-drama flick; based on the memoir, of the same name, by Vera Brittain. The story deals with Brittain's time spent as a nurse, in World War I London, while also coping with the loss of loved ones. The movie stars Alicia Vikander, Kit Harington, Taron Egerton, Colin Morgan, Emily Watson, Dominic West, Miranda Richardson and Hayley Atwell. It was directed by James Kent and written by Juliette Towhidi. The film is pretty moving, at times, and it has an excellent leading lady performance (from Vikander).The story is set in 1914, when Vera Brittain (Vikander) was rebelling against her 'upper class' family's wishes. She enrolled in school, at Somerville College (in Oxford); and later served as a nurse, in the First World War. Her brother Edward (Egerton), fiancé Roland (Harington) and friends, Victor (Morgan) and Geoffrey (Jonathan Bailey), also enlisted in the military (at the same time). Brittain did her best to remain strong, while watching those close to her die in battle; as well as many others, including German soldiers. She survived to become a powerful pacifist, and inspiring writer.The film is beautifully shot, and acted. Vikander is a very impressive up-and-coming actress; and even Harington isn't bad in the film. I have to admit, parts of the movie almost had me in tears. Like all good war films, it shows how devastating the consequences (of the futile act) are. It's also an inspiring story of rebellion, and following your own dreams (as well).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/j9uf6E4pnlw",Testament of Youth
10,Lejink,Anthem For Doomed Youth,7,22 November 2015,"I remember being given this book as a set text for an English A-Level examination over 30 years ago and am aware that there was a prestigious BBC production of it also several years back but this is the first dramatisation I've seen of Vera Brittain's novel documenting her own experiences in that golden age of post-Edwardian pre WW1 England when for coming-of-age birthdays you got given a piano from your father. That's if you were a girl of course, her more musically gifted brother conversely gets what she would have wanted, a scholarship at Oxford although on the other hand he is also at the the prime age to be called up for what he and most everyone else (but not their knowing father) believes will be a short, heroic and clean war which of course it turned out not to be (apart from the heroic part).Young Vera is headstrong, not only about wanting to make her own way in a man's world (female emancipation was still years away), but later about making her own contribution to the war effort by enrolling as a nurse while her lover, brother and other male friends are fighting in the trenches. Told wholly from her point of view, it's an entertaining if not enthralling watch, beautifully shot and well acted if somehow just lacking some extra pathos to really capture the hellish undertow of the War to end all Wars.Alicia Vikander is appealing as the vaguely tomboyish, intellectual Vera. In those days, it would appear, the golden youth had to be chaperoned everywhere by a usually imposing maiden aunt figure and make their feelings about each other known by writing and sending poems as the film strives to contrast the idyllic pre-war days of carefree swimming and carousing with the bleakness and destruction of war itself. For me, I didn't feel the contrast quite sharply enough and my abiding memories of the film are of the big family house and the dreaming spires of Oxford rather than the hell of the makeshift military hospitals and muddy and bloody trenches on the front line. The best shot for me was when I perhaps detected a tribute to all-time great movie ""Gone With The Wind"" as Vera goes Scarlett-like amongst the wounded and dying, searching for her wounded brother where the camera ascends into a sweeping dolly shot showing the full extent of the number of the casualties, just like Vincent Fleming's rightly famous take all those years ago.The supporting actors are picked from the familiar directory of experienced British character actors, notably Miranda Richardson and Emily Watson, while the young actors in the leads, all of them unfamiliar to me, perform with aplomb.There is a great true-life story to be told here and this film does so respectfully and responsibly, if just a little too carefully at times.",Testament of Youth
11,ThomasDrufke,Genuine,9,17 April 2018,"It's not an overly similar movie, but as I've recently watched Atonement, Testament of Youth gave me that same sort of touchingly effective drama with a backdrop of a world war. Obviously, the two are very differently told films. But they proved to each impress in a similar way. For Testament of Youth, this was Alicia Vikander and Kit Harrington's coming out party, at least in the film world. The latter is famous for his turn in that one certain HBO show while Vikander hadn't really done anything of notoriety before this, and she is absolutely the best part about this film. Whether it be as the tomb raiding Lara Croft, the grieving Isabel Graysmark, or the curious Ava, she is brilliant in anything she does. In fact, she's quickly becoming one of my favorite actresses to watch, merely for the sheer charisma she brings with every role. And as much as I want to commend Harrington, Taron Egerton, Dominic West (who ironically also plays her father in Tomb Raider), Colin Morgan, Hayley Atwell, and Emily Watson, no one comes close to Vikander's performance here. If this film didn't get lost in her year of Danish Girl & Ex Machina, perhaps she could have been an awards contender for this film. In fact, this may be my favorite performance of hers. Can I be anymore genuine about her utterly genuine turn?9.0/10",Testament of Youth
12,Irishchatter,About a young woman during World War I,8,19 February 2017,"I found that this movie was very sad because just like World War 2, loved ones were lost, overcrowding hospitals, soldiers,etc. Alicia Vikander was absolutely excellent at playing the role as the writer Vera Brittain. I seriously didn't know that Vera Brittain was a real person until before the credits that she was an actual help nurse during World War I. It really makes you think, what was it like back then? I'm sure it was pretty rough looking after all the injured and the dying soldiers at the same time. It probably was pretty exhausting for running around looking after everyone! It's heartbreaking that her fiancée, her brother, her brothers friend and many others she knew who fought in the war. I swear, even thought the actor's are not the actual people, it still breaks your heart. If you haven't cried while watching this, something is wrong here. It's just so sad, that's all I can say😢😢😢😢💔💔💔💔 💔💔💔",Testament of Youth
13,Reno-Rangan,The lesson the WWI taught us that we shouldn't let it fade away.,8,4 December 2015,"Kind of reminded me 'Atonement', but not a similar movie, except like you know the loved one goes to the war, serving a nurse in the army like stuffs. Actually, this one was a biopic of a young Vera Brittain that set in the England, 1914. Her wish becomes real to attend the university of Oxford, but at a same time the World War I breaks out and puts her dream to a pause while her beloved ones are fighting in the war. She fights her own way to save them and bring safely back home. For that she goes through many difficulties and by the time when war nears the end, the movie as well.I felt it was a bit lengthy, but covers everything without racing towards the end by trimming all the important portions. It was an anti-war theme. It demonstrated the struggles that everyone who linked directly to the war would go through. Like parents, fiancée, siblings, friends who send their loved ones to the war. Especially how the young generations are affected by the sudden warfare. So like the title, Vera tells the story by recalling her memories. The film won't show the battles, but only a glimpse of a few seconds for a couple of times.Alicia Vikander was at her best. She was quite impressive in the recent films of hers. I liked the filmed locations, some of the countryside landscapes were beautiful. The end scene is where it really breaks our heart, makes us to feel what Vera felt. The book which this movie was based on was a bestseller at that time, but was just a someone's story, although the world war two came. It is a good movie about a stupid war. The first major mistake by the man in the modern world, followed by another.8/10",Testament of Youth
14,eddie_baggins,A beautifully filmed adaptation,8,2 September 2015,"Told from the rarely seen or heard from perspective of a female in the times of war, U.K author Vera Brittain's memoir Testament of Youth first published in 1933, has in the succeeding years become one of literature's most renowned memoirs and arguably the quintessential voice to the youth that found themselves in the midst of the world's first all-encompassing war. Such a renowned piece of history, so loved and well known by many, is a daunting prospect to adapt but first time feature film director James Kent has crafted an elegant and quietly devastating project that's acts as a touching tribute to Brittan's memory and her touching writings.Filmed at a languid pace, now mostly foreign in modern day period adaptations, Kent and cinematographer Rob Hardy have crafted an artistic vision of Youth, perfectly encapsulating the wonders of walking a college ground, life on an old English manor or the sadness of a make shift medical ground that harbors the aftermath of life on the front line in World War 1. It's a beautifully filmed movie, every scene could be a painting and despite Youth's obvious budget constraints, there's never a moment here that makes one feel as though they're watching a film that is anything but high class. It's a credit to Kent, Hardy and also screenwriter Juliette Towhidi that they manage such a loaded and intelligent tale in the way they do and with a young, talented cast, Youth shines a light on some growing acting up and comers that will one day likely be members of the A-list.I for one have not been quiet in my growing praise for young Swedish actress Alicia Vikander, and on the strength shown here by her as a leading lady, there is now another reason to suggest Vikander is likely to become one of our generation's greatest big screen talents. Imbuing Vera with a grace, vulnerability and a stern determination (much like the real life author), Vikander makes Vera her own, so much so it's hard to imagine anyone else taking on the role. Everyone's favourite GOT hero Jon Snow (Kit Harrington in real life) shows up here as Vera's first love Roland and while he shows glimmers, Harrington feels a little miscast here although against Vikander on such form, many would pale in comparison. Another impressive member of the cast is young actor Taron Egerton last seen as the Kingsman: Secret Service lead as Vera's brother Edward and after the strength shown by him in Kingsman, it's nice to see him back up that performance here.A harrowing – without ever being manipulative look at the horrors of war, Testament of Youth is a considered and thoughtful examination of Vera Brittain's revered words and while the film does fail in certain instances (pacing sometimes an issue, fluidity also) the film is a handsomely crafted drama with some fantastic lead turns that will likely make it a new favourite to all those that prefer their BBC over the E Network or HBO.4 unwanted pianos out of 5",Testament of Youth
15,Red-125,A superb movie about the futility of war,10,20 July 2015,"Testament of Youth (2014) was directed by James Kent. It's a dramatic film based on the autobiography of the noted English pacifist, Vera Brittain.Alicia Vikander plays Vera Brittain, who in pre-WW I England, is barely allowed by her family to think for herself. She wants to go to Oxford and become a writer. Neither of these options is welcomed by her family. She persists, and does, indeed, get accepted at Oxford. However, all this debate and discussion about her future becomes basically irrelevant when World War I breaks out. Her brother, her fiancé, and their good friend all join the army. Vera becomes a nurse, first in England and then at the front.There aren't too many battle scenes. Instead--and in a way, worse--we get scenes of the carnage that follows the battles. When Vera is at the front, the scenes at the aid stations are graphic and horrible to watch. Another reviewer pointed out the similarity of one of the scenes to a scene in ""Gone with the Wind."" I noticed this too. In both movies, the camera pulls back to show us a huge field of wounded shoulders on stretchers, with just a few nurses moving among them trying to lessen their suffering.It's easy to understand why Vera Brittain was changed forever by her experiences as a nurse. So, in a technical sense, this is a coming-of-age movie. However, it's much more than that. Vera's coming of age meant that she understood the basic futility of the killing and maiming. Working with the wounded and the dying at the battlefront wasn't something that she was able to forget and put behind her. The war changed her into the peace activist that she became and remained.Alicia Vikander is a superb actor. This isn't her first film, but I was unaware of her work until I saw Testament of Youth. An earlier reviewer found her appearance too waif-like. In my opinion, she wasn't waif-like, but she had an astonishingly delicate Pre-Raphaelite beauty. My thought is that this works in the context of the movie. She may have looked delicate and incapable of any difficult, terrible work, but, when the time came, she rose to the challenge.We saw this film at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. It will work better on the large screen, because of the gorgeous scenery we see in England. (Obviously, there wasn't much beauty left in the scenery of war-torn France or Belgium.) Still, this is a film worth seeking out. If it's no longer playing in theaters, see it on the small screen. It's an challenging, important movie. Don't miss it.",Testament of Youth
16,leonblackwood,Too long but touching! 4/10,4,29 August 2015,"Review: This movie starts off to be quite upbeat but when her brothers and loved one goes off to war, it becomes quite depressing, as war is. From an entertainment point of view, I did get quite bored after a while but the content is touching and Vera Britain's story is full of emotional drama. The movie is set during the First World War and the happy go lucky Vera Brittain is a promising writer who wants to go to Oxford to further her education, against her fathers wishes. After some persuasion from her brother, her father finally agrees for her to go to Oxford, were she passes her exams whilst trying to hold down a relationship with her boyfriend who is fighting at war. After a couple of tragic incidents, she decides to put her education on hold and she serves as a nurse for the victims of war. There are other aspects to the storyline, like the touching love story and her rebellious attitude but you have to watch the movie to feel the emotion of her story. The acting was believable, especially from Alicia Vikander who played the lead but the pace of the movie is quite slow and pretty long. The director captured the period quite well, with the costumes and the cinematography but he focused to much on the main character which is why I got quite bored after a while. Anyway, it's a watchable period drama which covers quite a few elements but it did seem like it was never going to end. Watchable but too long!Round-Up: Alicia Vikander, 26, is a Swedish actress who has been making a name for herself lately in big movies like Ex Machina, the Man From U.N.C.L.E., Seventh Son, Burnt, with Bradley Cooper and the Danish Girl with Oscar winning Eddie Redmayne. For such a young age, she has done quite well in her acting career and she has a few movies in the pipeline like the next Bourne movie and the Light Between Oceans with Michael Fasbender and Rachel Weisz. Personally, I hadn't heard of her before I watched this movie but after seeing her filmography, I'm sure that she will become a household name. I keep on confusing her with Emily Blunt though! Anyway, this is the best acting that I have seen from Kit Harington, who is mostly known for his role in the Game Of Thrones as the famous Jon Snow and he seems to be popping up in a couple of movies lately like the Seventh Son and his major role in Pompeii. I'm not that impressed with his acting style because he seems a bit dead behind the eyes but he still has a major role in one of the biggest series ever made, so he must be doing something right. This is the first major movie directed by James Kent whose known TV movies like the Thirteenth Tale, Margaret and a couple of episodes of Eastenders so this must have been a big responsibility to take on. His experience explains why the movie is so long and I could see this film being a little mini series but it's a bit too much for the big screen. With that aside, it's a great achievement for a first movie but I personally had to watch it in two parts because I fell asleep.Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $5.3millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their war/romance/drama movies about the compelling story of Vera Brittain who was a rebellious woman who had to deal with war, lose and remembrance throughout her life. 4/10",Testament of Youth
17,Turfseer,"Moving chronicle of woman's self-sacrifice during World War I is undermined by naive, pacifist stance",6,15 June 2015,"I had never heard of Vera Brittain until I saw ""Testament of Youth,"" based on her anti-war memoir which was published in 1933. ""Testament"" is a beautifully mounted period piece which highlights the sufferings of Ms. Brittain who lost both her brother and fiancé in World War I. After watching ""Testament of Youth"" you will indeed feel a great deal of sympathy for Ms. Brittain, played with a quiet intensity by the up and coming Swedish star, Alicia Vikander. Nonetheless, the first half of the film is an extremely slow slog. At first, it appears the narrative is going to be about Brittain's rebelliousness as she is dead set in opposing her father, who doesn't want her to attend Somerville College, the woman's branch at Oxford (instead he prefers that she play the piano and find a husband). Nonetheless, she convinces daddy that sitting for the entrance exams is a good thing. She's almost tripped up when part of the exam features a Latin essay which she wasn't aware of and ends up translating it into German instead. Lucky for her, she still makes a good impression with the headmistress and she ends up being admitted.The rest of the first half is taken up with Vera's burgeoning romance with Roland Leighton and relationship with her brother, Edward, and a couple of their friends. Just before Roland leaves for military service, the passion between the two is ramped up, as they often try to run off and canoodle, despite being hampered under the watchful eye of a chaperone (in this case, Vera's portly aunt). Just keep in mind, the lugubrious touch of James Kent's direction and screenwriter Juliette Towhidi's decision to focus on Roland and Vera's infatuation, makes for some rather dull goings-on.Soon, the presence of newspaper headlines—notably the assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand and his wife—is a portent for more lively and intense things to come. Vera leaves college and becomes a Voluntary Aid Detachment, first at a hospital run by nuns in London. There the nuns give her a hard time as she's perceived as being an upper class snob. When Roland comes back from the front on a furlough, it becomes obvious right away that he's been psychically damaged by what he's witnessed. You know this right away when he punches Vera in her side and she falls to the ground. Some tender loving care however, gets him to feel his ""humanity"" again, and he promises to marry Vera on his next leave. Of course that never happens when at the very moment she's celebrating with her family due to the upcoming nuptials, she receives word that Roland was killed by a sniper. She's not content to hear the sanitized army version of his death and seeks out a colleague who provides a more upsetting narrative.Soon afterward, Vera falls completely into full-fledged self-sacrificing mode. She pledges to take care of a former friend who's been blinded during combat. But unfortunately he doesn't make it and propels her to as close to the front lines as she can get, by working at a field hospital in France. Here the narrative becomes the most gripping, where first she attends to a dying German soldier, who mistakes her for his beloved (Vera's knowledge of German comes in handy as she's able to comfort the dying Hun, pretending to be the woman he left behind). Then she's informed there's a badly wounded soldier who apparently was calling for her—sure enough it's brother Edward; and using all her nursing skills, she saves her dying sibling. Unfortunately, after being summoned home due to her mother's sudden attack of dementia, she spies a postman ringing the front doorbell and hearing the sobbing reaction of her father, we learn that Edward didn't make it—despite her earlier successful efforts to save him!Armistice Day is not a time for celebration for Vera, who is shattered by the tragic effects of World War I on herself and her family. The denouement is perhaps the weakest part of the film. Vera now becomes a full-fledged pacifist. She argues with fellow Britons, bent on revenge against the Germans and cites her experience in tending to the dying German back at the French field hospital. While the ""War to end all Wars"" was probably as pointless a war as you could ever get, the subsequent rise of Nazism and World War II itself, proved Ms. Brittain's pacifistic stance to be decidedly quite hollow. Michael Phillips writing in ""The Chicago Tribune"" was correct in stating that Ms. Brittain's star had faded by the time she died in 1970. This is because Hitler proved war IS necessary, in order to defeat evil!I don't wish to diminish the personal suffering of the film's protagonist nor cast doubts about the nobility of her self-sacrificing actions during World War I. That said, it appears that the trauma she experienced during those dark days, eventually clouded her judgment concerning the nature of evil in this world. The defeat of Nazism exposed the views of the pacifists as being wholly naïve, proving that isolationism and passivity were no solution to a nation of crazed nationalists devoted to fulfilling their barbaric Weltanschauung.",Testament of Youth
18,qui_j,A superficial interpretation of a great novel,5,21 June 2021,"Unfortunately, this movie version is a very superficial version of the memoir.

It works if you have not read the book and just want a quick synopsis of the era.",Testament of Youth
19,krocheav,Special Treatment Both Visually and Historically,9,17 September 2016,"Have noticed others have said they were a little upset with a couple of added sequences that were not from the book. Having not read the book this offered no distraction. While it maybe agreeable when a movie adaption follows a book - they remain distinctly different mediums - two different styles of writing, so it's not always fair to compere them. The book in this case is Vera Brittain's autobiography. This strong story has remained in print since it's first publishing in the early 1930's - quite something for a female writer of this era.Since the release of that fine Turkish film ""Gallipoli"" in 2005, 'Testament Of Youth' has to be one of the best examinations of the unforgivably tragic wastage of WWI - This was war created at the whims of those who regarded themselves as the upper echelons - so called leaders who did not deserve the very breath in their bodies. This BBC Films 2014/15 production is stunning to look at and listen too, from Jon Henson's detailed production design to just about every last cast member it's a powerful thought provoker. Swedish born Alicia Vikander may not always seem the right choice for the lead but works very hard in a demanding role, Kit Harington convinces as Roland, Alexandra Roach as Winifred, Dominic West as Dad and Emily Watson as Mum, fine performances all.... It's a strong feature directorial debut for James Kent - embellished with mostly lavish visual support provided by D.O.P. Rob Hardy (and thank heavens hand held camera-work is kept to a minimum). The screenplay by Juliette Towhidi is kept in check by the real life daughter of Vera Brittain, Shirley Williams. It's possibly because of this careful control the whole production maintains a high level of integrity that's rarely seen in modern movies. Lavish scenes involving steam trains are lovingly set up using trains from the Keighley and Worth / North Yorkshire Moors Railways. The music score by Max Richter (The Lunchbox '13 & Re-composing Vivaldi '14) adds handsomely and has been blessed with full-scale orchestrations by Dave Foster. What's unique about this film's treatment is its solid focus on being told from a female perspective. A young woman who experienced first hand the loss of family, lover, and friends - who then went on to write and speak out about the dehumanizing impact on all those who served and died or were left to suffer throughout their lives. And for what 'essential' purpose?. This film brings home the horror - not with endless shots of hideous trench warfare but by taking us into the inadequate treatment 'hospitals', where so many young lives agonizingly wasted away. All very tragic, but needs to be told and re-told...",Testament of Youth

It is a tearjerker indeed but a very classy and human one. But the overpowering element is the cinematography. The whole story is drawn with brilliant photographic brush work on a wide, warm toned canvas with mood, texture and atmosphere that captures so beautifully what Britain must have been like during those ugly years. They also have done a meticulous job with props, costumes and settings, everything from flowered hats and period writing pens to stately homes and vintage ambulances. Most impressive are the many wonderful railway scenes with interior and exterior views of stations, wagons, locomotives and rights of way. A superb film.

We go back to 1914 before that awful war had begun and find a young and feisty woman (referred to at the time as a 'blue stocking') who has ambitions of studying at Oxford and is willing to shun the conventions of finding a husband din order to realise her dream.She has a brother Edward (played touchingly by Taron Egerton) and he introduces her to his friend Roland. After a shaky start they realise they share a passion for poetry, the romantic sort and a friendship blossoms as indeed do their feelings. Then the war comes and everyone's intended plans for the future are put on hold to do their duty.What follows is truly heartbreaking, I was moved to tears at one point and that is very rare. The cinematography is superb, the direction excellent and all of the actors are completely convincing and bring their respective roles to full realised life. One of the poems starts with the words 'life and hope and love and you', and that could be a pretty good description of what this film is about. The whole thing is just excellent and is a film that I can not only thoroughly recommend but would urge people to see.",Testament of Youth

23,jrarichards,Vikander bewitches in exquisite portrayal of Vera Brittain's WWI experiences,9,25 December 2017,"In the context of this film still a strong-willed young woman, Vera Brittain (1893-1970) is a real-life figure well known for her pacificism of more recent years. This transformation is not entriely surprising given the way the First World War scythed through Vera's small circle of male acquaintances, be these her brother Edward (here played by Taron Egerton), his (and her) close friend Victor (Colin Morgan) or the man she falls in love with Roland Leighton (Kit Hartington). All the more so, as the months pre-War are ones of prosperity and carefree joy for these young people that the film portrays lovingly in Yorkshire settings, as well as at Oxford, given the fact that Vera pioneeringly succeeds in passing her exams to go there along with the boys. Boys is scarcely a wrong word here, as the war takes the Military Cross-winning Edward at age 23 in 1918, Victor at aged 22 in 1917, and Roland at aged 20 in 1915.And when the lovely, intense, at-time almost spellbinding Alicia Vikander plays Vera, we feel the magnitude of her loss, and wonder along with the character how she might possibly go on at all. The film only hints at her managing to do this, showing how she begins with her anti-war campaigning, not least because her time as an Army nurse has seen her tend to (and indeed talk to - given her linguistic knowledge) dying Germans as well as Brits.As one might expect, James Kent's rendering of ""Testament of Youth"" is beautiful, nostalgic, profoundly touching, persuasive and thought-provoking given the abrupt stop that was put to a very promising time for the whole country, as well as for so very many of its sons.",Testament of Youth

He already knows what it's like to die on a beautiful summer day when it's all quiet on the Western Front. But after watching this film, Paul and his friends all felt worse than when Behm got blinded by shell fire that night on wiring detail!Why is the pretty little dark-eyed girl with the cute hats and the nagging voice so irritating? Is it because she's utterly perfect and always right about everything? Paul Baumer wasn't perfect. He didn't know everything in the first scene of his story. In face he knew nothing at all!But Paul Baumer learned, and along the way he met other people, people he didn't know before the war. Unforgettable friends like Cat, and Tjaden. Enemies like Himmelstoss. War made all of these men suffer, but they did more than stare dreamily into space and talk about flowers and poems. Now and then they took time out to fight. And die.The lovely young miss in the cute hat doesn't die. All her men friends die, but they stay lovely and shining till the very end. They never cheer about getting an extra can of beans to eat. They never battle rats or burn lice over an open flame. They don't get angry or curse their schoolteacher or their sergeant . . . or their parents or the war or God. They're all to pure and good to really feel anything one way or the other. All the soldiers in this movie are so very upper class, so lovely and shining.

The work of Vera Brittain is brought to vivid life with period costumes, magnificent set design, and superb writing. The cast is uniformly excellent with Emily Watson standing out as the mother. Watson is a truly gifted actress who accomplishes astonishing things in some of her smallest roles and this is no exception. She is mesmerizing in every scene in which she appears and dominates the screen with her presence. Her eyes speak volumes and are more expressive of emotion than 10 pages of dialog.

Tragedy after tragedy plays out and this almost saintly martyr leaps from one anguished scene to another crying, sulking or shouting at people. Alicia Vikander, while lovely to look at, elicits no sympathy from the audience. The character she plays bears no resemblance at all to the complicated and intelligent woman from the book.The movie is delivered in such a contrived and melodramatic way that it feels like the director is sitting next to you with a box of tissues! There is no discernible chemistry of love or hate between any of the players and you get the feeling they showed up a few minutes before each scene was shot, handed their lines and then marched into action with a view of making it to the catering coach before the good sandwiches had been taken.It was just dull, boring and predictable.",Testament of Youth
27,gsygsy,distressing for the wrong reasons,2,20 November 2015,"Alicia Vikander is in pretty much every scene of this film. She does well, as do most of the other actors. It's not their fault that this adaptation of a British classic book about the First World War is mess.The screenplay scampers through the years, so most of the dialogue ends up being clunkily expository. When relationships or landscapes are dwelt upon, the tone is either hyper-romantic (swirling music from Max Richter) or hyper-subjective (DOP Rob Hardy and his hand-held camera). Relationships are diminished, events are melodramatised, the performances are undermined. What should be moving ends up as mawkish. A travesty.Track down the BBC serialisation from 1979, with the wonderful Cheryl Campbell as Vera Brittain, to see how much better this could have been done.",Testament of Youth
28,The_late_Buddy_Ryan,Great visuals and Alicia Vikander really lift this adaptation of Vera Brittain's powerful memoir,8,25 November 2015,"Vikander's assured performance really saves this film from being just another solemn costume drama, and it's largely thanks to her that the passion that inspired Vera Brittain's antiwar classic still shows through despite a sometimes rushed and perfunctory screenplay. Kit Harington (""Game of Thrones"") is suitably intense as Vera's fiancé, Roland Leighton (didn't recognize John Snow at first in his new guise as beardless nature poet).The camera may seem to dwell too much on idyllic country scenes and beautiful vistas at the expense of plot and character, though that does help to heighten the contrast between Vera's privileged but restricted prewar life and the new life of purpose and endless horror that awaits her at a field hospital in France. The camera's used most effectively when the two worlds collide-to illustrate Roland's poem addressed to the corpse of a German soldier found lying in a patch of wildflowers, most of all in the panorama of a boundless field of dead and dying men surrounding the hospital after a ""big push"" (which echoes the famous crane shot after the Battle of Atlanta in ""Gone with the Wind""). I'll let the nitpickers figure out if the Leightons' house on the South Coast really did have a magnificent view of what looks like the White Cliffs of Dover, but the stormy shoreline makes the perfect backdrop for a scene in which Roland returns angry and shellshocked from the frontThe basic storyline-Vera's service in France and her romance with Roland Leighton-is skillfully dramatized and very moving; her struggle with the conventions of Georgian family life is somewhat less involving, one exception being an ironic episode in which she's summoned back from the front to deal with a family ""crisis,"" only to find that her mother's gotten sick and has fallen behind with the houseworkThe much-praised '79 series with Cheryl Campbell only seems to be available on VHS and Region 2 DVD; I wouldn't hesitate in recommending this gorgeous and affecting new version as an alternative.",Testament of Youth

Based on the book by Vera Brittain which is a best selling account of her experiences during the First World War, this film follows the life of Vera herself during those harrowing times. Starting out gently, we follow Vera, her brother and his friends from their comfortable life in the country to the eve of the war in 1914 and beyond. I say gently because this film eases you into what was one of the horrors of recent history, a time which shattered people and ruined lives forever. After fighting so hard to get to Oxford, Vera then gives it all up to become a nurse, a journey which ultimately takes her to France and gives her first hand experience of the massacre that war dishes out. There is a romantic thread running through the film but her strongest bond is with her brother and her world is torn apart when he signs up to fight. Vera was played beautifully by Alicia Vikander, a Swedish actress who I am not familiar with, but she had look of Emily Blunt in her facial expressions and mannerisms, and unfortunately did not seem to age at all during the film, not even in grief. However that is my only criticism in an elegantly shot film even when covering the abomination that is war. Another cinematic experience to make you think.",Testament of Youth
30,troyputland,The Voice of Vera Brittain,7,26 September 2015,"Testament of Youth is a worldwide best-selling autobiography by Vera Brittain, played by Alicia Vikander in this film adaption. It's her account of her life during World War I. There's a melancholy vibe floating through the air; Vera, her family and friends are on tenterhooks, knowing the inevitable war will change everyone's lives. ToY shows that all those left behind were effected as well. Vikander is phenomenal. She single-handedly expresses the terror bestowed on the world, giving up her passion to study and becoming a nurse instead. Vera sees just as much horror as the troops sent away. Her brother (Edgerton), close friend (Morgan) and new love (Kit Harrington) end up on the front line. Vikander and Harrington's relationship is the weak point, never given the chance to flourish. It doesn't have the effect on the audience that it should. Once Harrington's gone he's forgotten. The moment is Vikander's, the bleak story hers alone.",Testament of Youth

She lost everybody in the war first Roland and then as she was nursing in France saved her brother but months later a message arrived that her brother died which led to dramatic change in her thoughts and behavior. Filled with memories and grief, it was a harsh path that she was already experiencing but as much as she is in pain that much she understands things and it was amazing. Movie just focuses on Vera which was amazing but there could be more characters involved and some actions didn't quite fit also pacing of the at times feel very slow. Alicia Vikander played Vera and she was absolutely brilliant as she portrays a strong women with her attitude, but with cleverness and smartness that was remarkable. So much pain but at the same time beauty and will in one character is brilliant. Kit Harrington played Roland and he was amazing with portrayal of how men that saw a lot of horror deal with it and how troubling their return to social life is difficult even if it's for short period of time.

32,CleveMan66,"""Testament of Youth"" needs to be clearer about what its testimony is.",4,19 July 2015,"Context is important. It's one of the reasons that I write my reviews the way I do. Understanding where a film came from and why it was made is an important part of deciding whether to see that particular film. This is especially true when a movie is based on a true story, but makes no attempt to establish its own context or an understanding of why it thinks it's important. Such a film can leave the viewer with the feeling that it lacks a cohesive story and is merely a random collection of practically disconnected scenes. This is the main problem with ""Testament of Youth"" (PG-13, 2:09) so here's some background.Vera Brittain (1893-1970) was a British feminist and pacifist writer who published her autobiography in a series of books called ""Testament of Youth"", ""Testament of Friendship"" and ""Testament of Experience"", with ""Testament of Time"" unfinished at the time of Brittain's death. The first one of these, which covers her life's journey between the years 1900 and 1925, has been highly acclaimed for its portrayal of the experiences of women during World War I (1914-1918) and the war's impact on the home front. It's this first installment in Brittain's autobiography that forms the basis for the film by the same title.Alicia Vikander stars as Vera Brittain. After a brief scene on the day that the armistice was signed, the story picks up just as the events that will lead to the outbreak of World War I are set into motion by the assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand. (Fellow students of history will be able to follow the movie's timeline through the shots of newspaper headlines spread throughout the film.) Vera is enjoying a relatively carefree existence with her younger brother, Edward (Taron Egerton) and his friend Victor when, just as she is telling her father (Dominic West) and mother (Emily Watson) that she shall never marry, she meets Edward's friend, Roland Leighton (Kit Harrington), the man who will one day propose to her.All Vera wants to do is be a writer. She has the brains and the passion and her parents have the means to send her to university, but she is battling the popular perception of the time that higher education is unnecessary for young women. Edward helps convince their father to allow Vera to apply to Oxford University and take the entrance exam. She works to prepare herself and, in spite of doing so in a self-created vacuum of sorts, she passes. Her time at Oxford's Sommerville College, however, is interrupted by the war. ""I must do something"" she says as she announces her decision to leave Sommerville and become a nurse as her way of supporting her brother, her new boyfriend, Roland, and their friends, which now also include Geoffrey (Jonathan Bailey).We see Vera serving as a nurse in London and, later, in France, where she decides to go to be closer to where her brother is serving. (Brittain's wartime service in Malta is not shown in the film.) As Vera cares for the injured and the dying, she has to overcome prejudice resulting from her well-to-do background, her total lack of knowledge and experience regarding matters of medicine, the stigma of sometimes having to care for wounded enemy soldiers and her grief at the death of so many men – both those under her care and some whom she knows personally. It's clear that these experiences have a profound effect on who she is as a person. As everyone else celebrates, she is strangely conflicted when the armistice is signed and an impromptu speech she makes at the end of the film gives a strong indication of the woman and the writer that Vera Brittain is to become.""Testament of Youth"" is based on a true story, but any indication of that fact is strangely absent from the film until the closing credits are about to roll. The film also fails to be honest about what it is. The movie's advertising and most of the film sells itself as a story about relationships, while a subtle anti-war message percolates beneath the surface, only to hit the viewer in the face as the movie ends. The acting is excellent (especially from Vikander) and the sense of time and place is solid, but what the movie lacks most is a strong narrative thread. It feels like it's the story of a strong young woman practically drifting through her own life and featuring scenes and connections which seem to come out of nowhere. I don't need a story in which everything is tied up with a bow, but I expect a movie to be honest with me about its point of view, or at least make it clear that the story is headed somewhere.

The trouble is that there's nowhere for it to go, except for her to realise that War is Bad - which is handled ham-fistedly as a street-corner debate with some Jingos. I can't help feeling it's a little self-indulgent to single out a story like this. So many women were bereaved, so many men were killed - and who's to say which had the worst of it? - and they didn't all get to make the privileged choices about it that Vera Brittain and her coterie did.

Based on an autobiographical account by Vera Brittain, this is an account of the impact of war on the women; mothers, wives & sisters who had to cope with the effects of war on home front. The scene with the newspaper carrying the names of all those fallen in the battlefield is very poignant & depicts the agony that those left behind had to live with everyday. Before war, all Vera wanted was to study at Oxford along with her brother & friends. But once the war started, her life & goals changed.The temper tantrums were too childish for my taste. Besides, the young bluestocking Vera is quite difficult to like but I could still get past it because perhaps that's the point. Vera is not agreeable & docile and therefore feels that she doesn't belong anywhere.

35,heyimmyx,Immy's review : Harrowing,9,10 August 2020,"The beauty of this movie is that it's able to depict the tragedies, loss of life and utter devastation caused by the war, without actually showing the war itself. The movie is shown through the eyes of young Vera Brittain (Alicia Vikander) whose entire life is turned upside down by the destruction of war. The film is incredibly sad because a young woman's dreams, ambitions and youth are ultimately striped away from her for the sake of a meaningless bloodshed, and loses everything she deems important. I love that the movie conveys to us that it isn't just the soldiers who suffered, but everyone ; all of the women who lost the men closest to them, the women who had to give up what they had fought so hard for, the estranged impact on families, mothers, fathers...This movie is a true representation of what the war meant for those who were left behind. Alicia gave a terrific performance ; her character felt honest and genuine, and she gave a lot of depth to a complex character who is perhaps difficult to play, so ultimately she nailed it. The movie had beautiful cinematography ; evoking a soft and romantic atmosphere, whilst strongly contrasting with the horrors and tragedy of war she must face, emphasising the sense of loss of her youth and normal life. Her and Kit Harrington had a wonderful spark and chemistry. The poems he reads aloud are truly electrifying and created a warm, hazy feeling. The build up of their romance, and Veras apparent strong relationship with her brother and the other men in her life make the ending ever more devastating, as you get so sucked into the story and the characters, and then for it to just fade away and see Vera's life transform, is truly soul crushing. This film is terribly sad but brutally honest, successfully getting the message across that war is completely meaningless, and changes everyone's lives for the worst. I found the armistice day celebrations particularly thought provoking...after losing everyone she loves, what is there really to celebrate? The millions of innocent lives lost? Highly recommend!",Testament of Youth
36,RMurray847,Alicia Vikander gives a subtle and charismatic performance in this flawed but affecting film,7,11 January 2021,"I have to judge this film on its own merits, as I have not read the memoir upon which it is based. So no comments on the accuracy/faithfulness/thoroughness of the adaptation. However, one fault of the movie is that it FEELS like a lot has been left out. We are asked to take some big jumps in time...we jump from high point to high point...but not taking the time to show less ""dramatic"" moments in the lives of the characters makes it a little harder to feel we know these people.We meet young Vera Brittain just months before the start of WWI. She comes from what seems to be a middle class family...enough money to have some servants, but not enough to consider paying for their smart daughter to go to Oxford for college. She's self-centered and focused on her studies...not interested too much in the frivolities of the men around her, including her beloved brother and his friends. Yet sparks fly (despite her desire to avoid such complications) with young and handsome Kit Harrington (best known as Jon Snow in GAME OF THRONES...in this film, he has no beard and is almost unrecognizable as a result). He encourages her studies and writings. They are both hoping to be Oxford bound. The viewer must presume that these folks are all thus just out of high school (or the equivalent), yet they all look far too old to just now be thinking about college. Ah well.College is interrupted by the start of the war, and the men in Vera's life are drawn into the conflict. She feels a need to serve (never fully explained), and becomes a nurse, first in England and then near the front. The men in her life move in and out of the story...but this is truly the story of Vera. Fortunately, because the script doesn't always give us all we need, we are in the hands of emerging star Alicia Vikander. (DANISH GIRL, EX MACHINA) Vikander is never less than interesting...her characters wears her emotions so clearly on her face, and we see her many inner conflicts played out so clearly on that canvas. Although I would say her performance in DANISH GIRL brings even more shades and subtlties, she still commands the screen.Part of that command comes from the fact that she is surrounded by some weak performances, and thus jumps even more clearly to the lead. Kit Harrington has some charm, but really not a lot of depth. And as Vera's parents, Emily Watson is given NOTHING to do but look dowdy (such a waste of a great actress) and Dominic West once again proves that he is a supremely over-rated actor...from his terrible Baltimore accent in THE WIRE to his ridiculous little role in 300, West's appeal is completely lost on me. Taron Egerton, as Vera's brother, fares a bit better, and has the most interesting character arc.It sounds like I'm mostly complaining, but now let me state that despite some noteworthy weaknesses, the drama inherent in this subject matter is quite compelling and the film is still quite affecting. WWI and the truly horrific conditions the soldiers endured, coupled with the primitive medical care they received, make from gripping stuff. With Vikander's strong performance anchoring everything, we see through her eyes the horror she sees. The film features some lovely cinematography, especially in the opening scenes, so we see quite starkly the contrast between the beauty of a peaceful world and the ugliness of a world at war. The film is low budget, so there are no real battle sequences...Vera was never in a battle, so how could we see one? This is not a movie that pretends to be telling the history of WWI. It is a film that shows the brutality and senselessness and randomness and sadness of war. While not exactly charting new territory, TESTAMENT OF YOUTH brings its own perspective on that familiar territory, and that's enough to make the film very worthwhile.",Testament of Youth
37,joncha,Not as good as the BBC miniseries,6,22 August 2020,"This is a heart-wrenching story dramatically told with an excellent cast, costumes, and settings. But to anyone who has read Vera Brittain's wartime memoir, it's evident that the scriptwriter was given the basic backgroundof the story and then told to just make stuff up. A much more accurate account of the book is the 1979 BBC mini-series by the same name. Being shorter, the movie had to leave things out, like Vera's nursing service on the island of Malta. But there's no excuse for going light on the bonding that took place between her and Roland as they fell in love. They shared poetry and a love of reading and discovered that they were true soulmates before he went off to war. Some inaccuracies also crop up, for example when Roland develops a fever as he ships out in 1916 they fear he may have the Spanish Flu, which didn't really become an epidemic until 1918.",Testament of Youth
38,wilsonstuart-32346,Anthem For Lost Youth,9,16 May 2018,"I watched the TV adaptation of Testament of Youth many, many years ago. As we were studying World War One at school, the destruction and carnage left me horrified; therefore I was deeply moved by Vera Brittan's account of fledging love and war time losses. I picked up this version of Netflix last night with great interest; could it, I wondereed, top the series that left me spellbound nearly three decades ago?The answer is not quite, the BBC TV series just shades it. I think the series alllows the characters a little more development time than the film allows. Nevertheless, there are a great many merits to this film. Although some of criticism of Alicia Vikander's Vera were a little harsh - she was growing up in a restrictive Edwardian, where 'young ladies' where expected to behave in a certain way - the cast and direction are uniformly first rate. I got a vivid impression of Rupert Brooke's England - lush, pastoral, with carefree youths at one with nature; a long vanished tranquility, that perhaps never really existed, except innoir imagination.The scene at the railway station was nothing short of heartbreaking - it is here, with Roland's departure, that enormity of what might happen actually sinks in.As the war drags on Vera volunteers as a nurse, anything to be closer to her loved ones at The Front - a fiancee, a brother, two close friends. She copes amidst the horrific carnage, the grim aftermath that's far from the honour and glory. Like the women left behind in all wars since the dawn of time, through a series of hard lesson she learns to gradually cope with the responsibilities thrust upon her - whilst living in a state of near constant trepidation; anything to avoid the dreaded telegram.I remember her compassion towards the dying German soldier - the enemy who bleeds the same blood, has the same flesh as we do.Her world is shattered many time over; War, grief and illness bleed her. It is staggering to think how many families must have went through same ordeal - only to emerge with wrecked lives into a confused and dangerous new world with no clear answers. Vera Brittan's work is for the survivors and their ghosts, for anyone who survived a war and asks 'why?' on their lips. It is a superb film and a worthy adaption. Watch it or the TV series.",Testament of Youth

40,richard-fieldhouse,People and society changed for ever by the awfulness of the Great War,9,3 March 2018,"This is a film in which we see the war through the eyes of Vera Brittain - played beautifully (perhaps almost too beautifully) by Alicia Vikander. The original book is autobiographical based largely on real events. We first meet Vera as a cosseted and headstrong young girl whose main longing is for a chance to study at Oxford, but as the film progresses the war begins and forces itself into everyone's lives. With her friends joining up, Vera feels it her duty to serve as a nurse - firstly in England and later close enough to the front line to hear the sound of the guns and trudge through the all pervasive mud.The horrors of treating dreadful wounds with woefully inadequate resources are shown in sufficient - but not obsessive - detail. There is a lot of blood. Vera becomes hardened by her experiences and learns the strength of will it takes to survive. And it is this inner strength that carries her, and us as the audience, on through all the horrors that war threw her way. Shortcomings of the production are generally trivial, to my mind the most significant being the somewhat patchy portrayal of regional accents. On the other hand a great strength is a feeling of authenticity for some of the lines. You feel we might well be hearing the exact words that were used as real people reacted to their torment a hundred years ago. And understanding some of the thoughts and feelings that were left unexpressed.There's poetry too. It's a massive challenge to present poetry with the right tone in this kind movie, and I felt they achieved it remarkably well.I now definitely feel I should read the book. So it must be a good film.",Testament of Youth
41,AliceofX,"Good, but not Great",7,9 June 2015,"Testament of Youth is one of those dramas that manages to rise above the usual mediocrities enough that you can call it good, but not enough that you can say anything more about it. It is by no means a bad film, but there is nothing great about it, nothing that would make it one of the Must See films of the year.The biggest problem, which I realized this year while watching Wild, is that a 2 hour film is not a good medium for biographies that try to capture an entire person's life. Things move too fast, there is no time for gradual change to happen.Vikander's Vera appears to be on the same emotional tone through out the film and that is probably my biggest complaint about the film in that it is lacking a contrast about life before and after the War.But with the negative out I don't want to give the appearance that I did not like the film. It was a steady drama, albeit more on a TV movie level rather than cinema, with characters that felt like real people. My favourite parts are those at the end where we see Vera overcome by her grief and loss, incapable to see how to go on. The clip shown at the beginning is arguably the best of the film.",Testament of Youth

43,CharlieGreenCG,"Unseen perspective, and solid-account of the despair that war causes.",8,23 October 2014,"Considered one of the greatest war memoirs ever written, the Testament of Youth is a true-life account of Vera Brittian's life from 1914 - 1918, and a chronicle of how the First World War affected not only her, but the nation's lives.One of the things that determines Testament of Youth different to other bloody, explosive and bullet-ridden war tales is that it is focused on the domestic view of the ones who not only joined the war on the front-line, but also those at home and the consequent effects on loved ones, offering an unseen perspective, and solid-account of the despair that war causes.Beginning in pre-war 1914, we are introduced to Vera Brittain, a determined and wilful individual with aspirations of not becoming just a traditional young-married women, but one who attends Oxford University and chooses her own life-choices.Along with her brother Edward (Taron Egerton) and his two friends Victor (Colin Morgan) and Geoffrey (Jonathan Bailey), they all enjoy their youth in the rural village with their parents (Dominic West and Emily Fox). On-the-road to Oxford, she is introduced to her brothers close friend Roland (Kit Harington), and a relationship soon breaks out - but untimely, as does the war.Quite proud to do so out of loyalty to Queen and country, her brother Edward, and friends Victor and Geoffrey with Roland all sign up to the forces to assist. (Against parental wishes to do so). Now at Oxford, yet unable to focus as this devastation is happening all around her, she joins the forces too, as a nurse - and the film develops from there.Given a world-premiere at the 58th BFI London Film Festival, the film is squeezed out in time for the Remembrance holidays and by-all accounts award season. Based on our criticism alone, it is going to be praised and remembered at both.Crafted by former TV-movie director, James Kent, along with the (brilliant) cast, Testament of Youth is a thoroughly engaging history drama in Downton Abbey-esqe war times and a unique approach to the war like never before.",Testament of Youth
44,wgingery,Iraq 1.0 Sensitive treatment of war's annihilation of life and love,8,18 May 2017,"Fine performance from Alicia Vikander, revealing the sensuality beneath the intellect, the steel inside the woman.The men's performances work well, too, because the director has drawn out the essence: innocent young men cast into a furnace.Don't be fooled by the first part. This is not Masterpiece Theatre. But Brittain was the daughter of an upper class, wealthy family, and you can't understand the shock of the war's devastation without first experiencing her innocent, luxurious life before.""You don't know what you have until you lose it."" The book wasn't published until 1933, so this story represents the fruits of mature reflection on the personal costs of the war.If I have one objection, it's that in the hospital and war scenes, the women always seem so well groomed and their clothes so clean. I wanted more disheveled hair, and soiled, torn and patched uniforms,(For a film about the Great War from a different perspective, that of a Scottish farmer's wife, see ""Sunset Song,"" with Agyness Deyn.)",Testament of Youth

Kit Harington, if you can get past the idea he is John Snow in Game of Thrones, which happens quickly because he is nothing resembling John Snow, you will enjoy the movie so much more. He really steals your heart all the same. Taron Egerton is an up and coming heart breaker. Very young and stacked with talent. Be on the look out for him in the very near future working with some big talent. He can hold his own and even shine among whats already very bright. Good heavens this movie broke my heart.

In such detail i have never seen before.It is the never ending loses during times where time can feel frozen and flying at once.The nightmares I had of a possible war when I read a lot of world war 2 stories gave the exact same feeling as this movie does. And none other movie has achieved that before. The restained feeling when live is dictated instead of molded.Bravo to the maker of the movie but even more to the writer of this story. She succeeded where nobody else really did. She made an idea that spread through almost all of western europe for over a 100 years. 'This never again'.

For all the beautiful detail (wonderful locations, costumes, interiors, etc.), the film feels flat. This Vera Brittain is angry and miserable at the beginning, angry and miserable in the middle, and angry and miserable at the end. It would have helped a lot if there had been more warmth, idealism, and happiness in the ""before"" sections. The male characters manage this, but Vikander fell flat, for me. For viewers to care about Vera, she needs to be somewhat likable and sympathetic. Instead she seems to have a chip on her shoulder throughout.

50,ChristyLeskovar,"Good movie, staying closer to the book would have been better.",8,30 July 2015,"This is based on the memoir of Vera Brittain who left Oxford to volunteer as a nurse during the First World War, while her brother and her fiancé were in the army at the front. I read the book while researching the First World War for One Night in a Bad Inn, and I quoted a passage from it on page 248. I thought the movie was a well done adaptation, for the most part. The blow up with her parents over going to Oxford wasn't in the book. Her father was reticent to spend money on her education. It was a visit from a family friend that helped change his mind. Some parts about her brother were not in the book, and considering how detailed the book is, I assume were fictional. These diversions from the book did not improve the story. The screenwriter left out one of the most dramatic parts of the book. I never understand why a screenwriter wanders off into fiction when the true story is so dramatic and cinematic. The depictions of the field hospitals, the trenches, the mud, the miserable conditions, were quite accurate. One other diversion from the facts – the Spanish Flu was not at the beginning of the war, but at the end. All in all, it is a good movie. Bring Kleenex. It is a sad story.",Testament of Youth
51,grrwuff,Uncut diamond...,7,16 March 2016,"...meaning that, in my opinion, this adaptation of ""Testament of Youth"" has potential on several levels: Leading characters doing a good job of portraying young men and womens lives, dealing with both love and death at a young age, at the same time. Both Vikander and Haringtons performances, being somewhat rough in their dramatization, which curiously enough adds credence to the portrayal of teens/young adults. Not the hefty realization of drama as Knightly and McAvoy in ""Atonement"" of 2007, an all time favorite of mine, but certainly a wonderful interpretation of uncut human feelings under complex terms of existence.In fact I think, that ToY has enough dramatical potential to make it in to a series; a new ""Brideshead Revisited""(1981), with another narrative outset- a youth's perspective.Such promises from a flock of young British actors in this movie, which gives me yet a reason to face the future of European cinematography with a smile!",Testament of Youth

This almost flawless film strikes straight to the heart and, for once, I found its intense emotionality not cloying or manipulative, but appropriate. Outstanding acting and sublime cinematography throughout. To point out its few little flaws would be ungracious and quite irrelevant.

56,fiercecelt,Into the depths of sorrow,9,18 July 2020,"WOW. This film really challenged me so emotionally. There is so much joy and so much sadness/sorrow intermingled. The bright stars of young adulthood, shining like kleig lights, suddenly are darkened and remanded to memory.I wept. Yes, indeed, I did weep. War is so decisive and final. Alicia Vikander as Vera Brittain carries her role superbly. Hers is a heavy weight to carry, as each moment of presumed joy turns into yet another tragedy.
Her dashingly handsome Roland, (Kit Harrington) husband to be, killed on the Front in France when it was all assured he was far enough behind enemy lines to be saved. But, like any good soldier, Roland felt compelled to fix a spot in the barbed wire fencing. The good and patriotic soldier does what needs to be done. Vera is notified of her husband-to-be's death on their wedding day. Somehow, I knew it was ""too good to be true"".Next, Victor Richardson (portrayed by Colin Morgan) dies in hospital where Vera now is a nurse. Vera actually proposes to Victor, who now is blind from the war. Victor declines. The next day he has died.The third knife in Vera's everloving and determined soul is when Edward, her brother, dies in Italy after Vera has saved him as a patient in hospital in France. (Edward is portrayed by Taron Egerton).What makes this all the more sour and dreadful is how the three lads were all close friends and each like a brother to Vera. Although I did not serve in combat, I did serve during the Cold War Era in classified Intel overseas. One need not serve in the battles to understand at very deep levels how the losses in war cripple the soul and spirit. The other factor that is played well in this movie is that rebounding spirit of youth. There is not mountain too high to climb or river too wide to cross. That is why the Military loves us when we are young. We embrace a certain youthful obstinate determination that Military culture thrives on.I may watch this movie again. Even get the book.

This speech looked like a dissonance against the background of the shown her mind. How could she say that at the end, in such a way? Realizing the compulsion of certain actions?
Let me remind you, Joe Biden, the beacon of democracy recently said - violence is a forced measure, as the last argument. Let me also remind you that in his inauguration speech he said the following - ""And I promise you I will fight for those who did not support me as for those who did.""
These two phrases from 2021 from the President of the United States probably best characterize the final speech of the main character, showing the constant duplicity of the real world, in contrast to the world of idealists.",Testament of Youth

I have not read the book, but I did some reading on Vera Brittain, I should say that the screenplay has touched on all the key parts of her story at the time.The best way to tell if a film is succesful is the beginning and the end, and this film has has excelled beauty and strength in both. It should have definitely at least won an Oscar for best screenplay/leading actress, and funny but it has received no awards for screenplay or directing.

At one point, early on, Vera Brittain gives an opinion on one of Roland Leighton's poems, saying she 'can't see him in it'. That's pretty much how I felt about this movie. It sort of told Vera's story but somehow I couldn't really see her in it either. Maybe it was aimed at a generation now so removed from the customs and self discipline of Vera's generation that it wasn't felt necessary to replicate it. Certainly the mud, the horror and the general bedlam of World War 1 were all present, but the characters and the story line seemed two dimensional rather than three dimensional. And whilst it would be impossible to convey the complete bitterness and anguish of a young woman who experienced the horror of losing a loved one, in the same way that the memoir did, I have seen more convincing television productions in the past. And the final insult came at the end when Vera returns to the location shown at the beginning of the movie, as Roland's poem Hédauville is recited, and even that is watered down and incomplete.",Testament of Youth

Imprinting glamour serves to distort and dilute a classic piece of writing. 'Lets get some tea..' Just about sums up the inane script.

61,syam-807-607269,"'A story of young love, the futility of war, and how to make sense of the darkest times.'",9,14 July 2016,"Testament of Youth is a screen adaptation of Vera Brittain's World War One memoir of the same title. This adaptation, by Juliette Towhidi, portrays Brittain's key witness account of not only the superficial, but also the undercurrent of war. It's a personal story of how one person faces war and tragedy in an existential world.Vera (Alicia Vikander) has a silver-spoon background; she acts unadmirably when her request to study at Oxford by her father is rejected. However, it's hard not to adore the character of Vera through the narrative as we witness her open-mindedness, altruism, bravery, hope, dreams, love, futility, and how she makes sense of her decisions in the darkest times. Not many actresses could pull off such a plethora of emotions, Vikander does so with aplomb.I have read some criticisms that this film is over pious towards the memoir, therefore there is not enough ingenuity within this screen portrayal. Regardless of piety, I have to disagree with such critiques. Testament of Youth is a film that sucks you in through its stellar acting and heart-wrenching drama. The ingenuity lies in the form of pertaining to the forefront of war but not extensively showing us it. A film that so strongly connects us with all those who were associated dearly with war, that the mere sight of seeing a loved one at risk raises the tension to a queasy level. A level where we truly understand how Vera Brittain went on to write one of the defining memoirs of her age, giving a voice to a lost generation.This film, understandably, could not fit in all of the detail from Brittain's 661-page memoir. However, Towhidi tries to elect as much detail of the run up to war and the war itself, then gives us a glimpse of the aftermath. This works, the action is quick and certainly both affective and effective.Admittedly, as a twenty-four year old ignorant of any major war (at time of review), this film didn't naturally entice me. I now not only know of Vera Brittain and her trials and tribulations, but I also feel a genuine admiration for her and all she accomplished. This is testament to this film.",Testament of Youth

It is supposed to be about a woman who is progressive and educated but she thinks of nothing but her man, with seemingly nothing original to say and who sets herself up to be disappointed constantly. The film is not badly acted, not badly scored, not badly shot, but so contrived that every scene felt like I'd watched it before a dozen times, and so by the end I was exhausted with repetition.

The cinematography is great, so are the costumes, sets and locations. However, the main character played by a Swedish actress, talking in a cut glass accent with wooden tones, fails to move. Alicia Vikander's performance consists of a series of repetitive actions- clenching jaws, swallowing, staring grumpily, taking deep breaths, trembling and crying. I had seen Vikander in the Royal Affair and this kind of 'acting' was what she did there too. It is only in the last scene that the passion of Vera Brittain comes alive somewhat. The other characters are better acted. There are many goofs in the movie- including a scene of torrential rain lashing down with bright sunlight at the same time. The movie could have been shorter with more attention given to Brittain's pacifist nature and why she chose to be that. Instead much of the movie is taken up by shots of Vikander caressing anything- flowers, branches, clothes, mud, grass, etc. Many people walked out of the hall where this was screened. At least I didn't pay to see this movie- it would have been a waste of money! Read Brittain's great book, don't waste your money on this.",Testament of Youth
66,mannacio-124-682011,Flawed Adaptation,5,30 June 2015,"I refrained from reviewing this movie until it was possible to view the BBC TV version made in the late 70s. While that series consists of 5 parts lasting over 4 hours it is not simply length that makes it far superior. The BBC version is never mawkishly sentimental or histrionic as this Hollywood version is. My first reaction to Vera, in the Hollywood version, is that she is petulant in a way not that is not befitting to her character. After all, this is a well brought up girl, living in England, in the early 20th Century. Strong opinions are one thing but temper tantrums are quite another. There are also a lot more tears shed in the movie than in the TV series. Not that there aren't enough tragic events to warrant tears but, sometimes, less is more - and this is one of them.Apart from the above there are factual differences between the movie and the TV series. Does she speak German, or not? Does her father thrust an unwanted piano upon her or not? How does her mother take the pressures of the tragedies? All of these things are presented differently in the movie and the TV series. Also, though I will not explain how, the endings are quite different.One could hardly believe both of these were adaptations of the same book. And which do you believe is more accurate? No, even though this movie can be enjoyed as a melodrama it really does not deserve even to share the same title as the book.",Testament of Youth

This really is a story about love, friendship and loss. The fact that it was based on someone's memoir made it all that more real and devastating, considering that could happen to anyone( if a new war was to begin) and has and is, in certain parts of the world, happening to someone right now.They haven't sugar coated anything in this film, and even though I've gone from being cheerful to completely distraught, I wouldn't change anything about it.If you want to watch a film that is real, explicit in the right way, but without gore or an irrational amount of romance, and with the perfect cast and acting, that has beautifully reflected this brave woman's story......................

From War Horse to the Wipers Times, there have been quite a few films over the last few years that covered the horrifying reality of life in the trenches of Europe.I found this to be a well-acted and balanced presentation. It has left me with a lingering sadness and I feel that it has accomplished the purpose of showing the viewers the aching emptiness and futility of war. No one in this story escaped the impact of the World War I years.

The politics of the day, the social structure which was so important in Brittain's struggle, were only hinted at. it's because I read the book I found myself moved to tears, as I know what was between the lies and in the history.

It is so easy to destroy, to shatter all the dreams, it is so easy to bring nothingness, emptiness, nonentity.Vera helped me to notice the word ""Memory"" in my life. Do I want to be remembered? How I want to be remembered? How I will remember those I love, respect, admire?I've bought her autobiography after watching this movie.Thank you Alicia for the great performance!",Testament of Youth
71,CinemaM0nster,If you liked Atonement,10,22 July 2021,"This is just as heartbreaking, touching, and infuriating as the film Atonement. Similar as far as how all were thrown into war and giving you the perspective of being in that chaos. Different in the aspect of how they came to be part of the war. Definitely a sad story of love and loss and related well. Never read the actual memoirs but it did put you in their shoes and feels to give a sense of what it felt like in that time and era for what youths back then had choices for.",Testament of Youth
72,iaiang469,"A tale of great courage by a young, independent woman who was willing to stand with her loved ones, even when it was dangerous.",8,23 August 2015,"Brilliant acting by Alicia Vikander. You can really feel her dedication and selflessness.Great Chemistry between her and the various cast members like Taron Edgerton.Tale of soldiering on despite so much loss around her, and believing in her cause though it may not be the safest one. Ends with a note of forgiveness and highlighting the common humanity that unites all nations. Really a brave woman who could have taken the easier path of studying but chose not to, was willing to stand with the young men in her lives. Scenes really depict the realities of the war at that time and there are also many sad moments, which make you really feel for Vera in her times of grief. Was glad to have seen this film and it shows that Alicia has great potential in future roles.",Testament of Youth

74,daddaa555,Walking on the path of ghosts,7,12 June 2015,"A lovely drama, an amazing autobiography; a reproduction. Vikander fits the role, the story centers almost entirely on her character and how she experienced the war. However the film doesn't necessarily'haunt' you afterwards like for instance the Cold Mountain(a pure 10 as a war drama); perhaps this autobiography should be read to be understood more intimately. A young love prevented from being fully consumed by the ''glorious''war, friendships broken by the horrors which they all understood very little. Themes of longing, waiting and sorrow.There are no war scenes that are too harsh, lovely music, some beautiful scenery. Definitely worth a watch, though I would only watch it again if on TV.",Testament of Youth

76,mubinavisram,Heartbreaking Portrayal of Love and Loss During War,10,16 June 2015,"I first read ""Testament of Youth"" during university and was captivated by the emotionally moving real-life story of love and loss during war. The memoir spurred me on to read more about Vera Brittain, particularly during the World War I period that is the setting of ""Testament of Youth."" Having read her diary ""Chronicle of Youth"" and ""Letters from a Lost Generation"" long before watching this film, I had formed a strong attachment to Vera Brittain almost as if she was a personal friend. Reading her words, it is very easy for anyone, particularly a young, studious person to relate to her and the blossoming romance she describes between herself and her first love, Roland Leighton. As such, I had extremely high expectations for this film, and was skeptical that Alicia Vikander and Kit Harington would be ""my"" Vera and Roland--I had such a fixed idea of them in my head. Fortunately Alicia and Kit's performances met my expectations. They had wonderful chemistry and the relationship as portrayed captured the essence of Vera and Roland: the intelligent, witty banter, sweet/innocent flirtatiousness, passion and angst. This relationship is at the heart of the memoir and is the driving force for much of what occurs during and after its commencement, so it was very important for this relationship to be portrayed accurately and to be emotionally moving for the audience, which it certainly was for me. Supporting characters played by Taron Egerton (Edward) and Colin Morgan (Victor) were also wonderfully portrayed, which was a relief as the relationships with her brother and friend are extremely important in the memoir as well, and just as emotionally moving as the romance between Vera and Roland. As far as the other aspects of the film are concerned, the stirring scenes at the hospital where Vera volunteers as a nurse are gripping and faithfully portray the tumultuous wartime experiences that Vera describes in her memoir.The highlight for me was the poetry of Roland which is interwoven during key moments in the film. This is a lovely element to the story that I found very touching and it provides a beautiful, emotional backdrop for key scenes. I really hope this film spurs those who haven't read the memoir/have never heard of Vera Brittain to go on and read ""Testament of Youth."" The book certainly lingered in my mind for quite some time after I had first read it, and the film likewise recaptured those feelings for me.",Testament of Youth

Their poems were so touching and good while they were sending letters to each other.After the war her fiancé went to fight against Germany and she couldn't stay watching so she volunteered to be a nurse.She saw how the war was harsh. She was treated so badly while she was a nurse.Then she knew that her fiancé was dead at the war. Then she lost her brother.It is a very touching story. I don't know when our world will be free of wars.It reminded me of my country Syria. I had to fled out of it and leave my college and my family.I have lost a lot of my friends and I have lost my uncle :(I'm apart from my fiancé now and we are writing to each other how much we love and miss each other.I'm counting the days to go back to my country and start with the Syrians building our country again.We have the right to live our live like all other the world.

78,locktowner,"Well Acted, Moving Film",10,18 July 2015,"I found this to be an engaging, interesting film that gives you a rare female perspective on the Great War. Any depiction of WWI-- whether in book or in film-- is bound to be profoundly sad. Vera Brittain's poignant journey from excitement and idealism to the depths of despair during the course of the war is very moving and interesting. About 80 people were in the theater when I saw the film. There wasn't a dry eye in the place and most stayed for several minutes after the credits rolled. Brittain's experience parallels in some respects that of the nurses in the popular WWI drama series on PBS called ""The Crimson Field"" This was worth seeing..",Testament of Youth
