0,SnoopyStyle,rolling my eyes hard,5,1 September 2018,"Reverend Toller (Ethan Hawke) is the pastor at the historic First Reformed Church in Albany, New York. The congregation is small and it's considered a tourist church. It was a stop in the underground railroad and is approaching 250 years with a reconsecration ceremony. He has a clash of opinions with church leader Jeffers (Cedric the Entertainer) and industrialist Edward Balq, the benefactor of a large neighboring church. Meanwhile, he is approached by parishioner Mary (Amanda Seyfried) with a problem. After getting out of Canadian prison, her environmental activist husband Michael is in despair and wants her to have an abortion. He does not want to bring a child into this dying world. Later, he kills himself leaving behind a suicide vest.I rolled my eyes every time that suicide vest appear. It took an interesting look at the desolate modern spiritual world and injects a shock value. I can't take the pastor would seriously consider using it. Paul Schrader could be making a statement or simply trying to shock the audience. Instead of shock, I felt manipulated. Due his personal loss, suicide is definitely in the cards but I don't see the random killings of a suicide vest a possibility. It shouldn't be a vest. It should be the rifle he used to kill himself. He should be targeting Jeffers and Balq. That vest ruins a perfectly compelling character study.",First Reformed
1,Prismark10,The brooder,6,18 April 2019,"Writer Paul Schrader wrote Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. Both landmark movies.Schrader only got his first Oscar nomination for First Reformed. It does not say much about the Academy's nomination process. Raging Bull is regarded as one of the greatest films of the 20th century. There has be more to it than just Robert De Niro learning how to box and then putting on weight.First Reformed is a slow, intense tale. It is also directed by Schrader, a man brought up in a devout Calvinist household.Reverend Toller (Ethan Hawke) is the protestant priest at the historic First Reformed Church in Albany, New York. It is a small tourist church as it was used to hide escaped slaves on their way to Canada.Toller drinks too much, his health is not good and he has a crisis of faith. His marriage collapsed after the death of his son in military action.The local church leader Jeffers (Cedric the Entertainer) is concerned about Toller ahead of the reconsecration ceremony due to take place. Jeffers is in charge of a bigger church sponsored by an industrialist.A catalyst for change arrives when Toller is approached by Mary (Amanda Seyfried.) She is an environmental activist with her husband Michael. Her husband is concerned about bringing up children in a dying world, Mary is pregnant and her husband is troubled.Michael kills himself and he had made a suicide vest signifying that he planned to commit an atrocity.Toller is a man who is both lost and raging at the modern world, just like Travis Bickle. Unlike Bickle though Toller does not find redemption through a violent act. Schrader has gone for a contemplative, shocking yet muddled ending.There is an austere quality about First Reformed. Schrader must surely been inspired by Ingmar Bergman and even his own upbringing. Although not wholly successful in its meaning, it features a strong moody performance by Hawke.",First Reformed
2,nogodnomasters,Will God forgive is?,3,11 August 2018,"The film centers on Reverend Toller of the First Reformed Church and souvenir shop. He keeps a journal of his activity which wasn't bad except he reads to us in monotone his boring writings. He counsels one person who is an environmental activist. Toller sees his point of view that we need to protect God's creation and be good stewards of the planet. Toller is also ill and we suspect stomach cancer. Toller must plan for the 250 year celebration of the church as he explores his options. Ethan Hawk made the film extremely boring. Amanda Seyfried had a normal role and was also boring. Very dull writing. Oh yeah, save the planet. Maybe God wants us to cover the surface with asphalt, concrete, and plastic. I couldn't tell if the film was about Toller and human relationships with an environment background, or an environmental movie done badly. Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.",First Reformed
3,kosmasp,Silent but deadly,8,21 November 2018,"Or is it? And what kind of deadly are we talking about? Bored to death some will immediately say. And if that is what comes to mind while you watch it, I would totally get it. And not because of anything in particular other than the pace of the movie. How it conducts itself and how the viewer will perceive it. But as always this will be a decision everyone has to make for themselves. Another reviewer calls this a somber masterpiece.Whether you agree with the assessment or not, the user felt like it while watching it. Paul Schrader is most definitely not someone who'll do a movie that's purely entertaining. And since he has written this too, you can imagine that the guy behind Taxi Driver and Bad Lieutnant is not going to hold back or become mainstream. Does the end justify all means though? Well if you hold onto it until then, you may feel that way or you may feel dissapointed. Just because this is ""art"" does not mean, you have to like it. But if it floats your boat, you'll be so high, it will feel like heaven ...",First Reformed
4,lee_eisenberg,intense one,9,13 May 2019,"Paul Schrader often directs movies about people on self-destructive paths, and his Academy Award-nominated ""First Reformed"" doesn't relent. Ethan Hawke plays a minister whose conscience starts to get to him when environmental issues come to his attention. Whatever you think of how they told the story, it brings up important issue. I recommend it, but be forewarned that it's going to depict some harsh things and will almost certainly disturb you.",First Reformed
5,jboothmillard,First Reformed,6,24 February 2019,"This film received just one nomination in one of the big ceremonies of Awards Season, I did see Mark Kermode talking about it, and I saw clips or trailers, it was meant to be good, rated well by critics, so I watched it, directed by landmark writer Paul Schrader (Taxi Driver, American Gigolo, Raging Bull, The Mosquito Coast). Basically Reverend Ernst Toller (Ethan Hawke) of the First Reformed Church in Snowbridge, New York is writing down his thoughts in a journal for a year, after which he intends to destroy it. First Reformed, a 250-year-old Dutch Reformed Church which was once a stop on the Underground Railroad, faces dwindling attendance. Under Toller's leadership has taken the church in a new direction and away from its historical focus on Reformed theology; today it serves mostly as a tourist attraction. Toller is trying to manage his own life issues, such as his alcoholism, he seeks a deeper experience through reading Roman Catholic writings and mystical books. This new spiritual direction leads him to seek support from a nearby charismatic megachurch, Abundant Life, which owns First Reformed. Toller is also struggling with the death of his son Joseph, Toller had encouraged him to enlist, Joseph was killed in the Iraq War. Toller meets pregnant churchgoer Mary (Amanda Seyfried), who is seeking counseling for her husband, Michael (Philip Ettinger), a radical-environmentalist. Michael further challenges Toller's beliefs, explaining that he wants Mary to get an abortion, because he does not want to bring a child into a world that will be rendered almost uninhabitable by climate change. Mary finds a suicide vest belonging to her husband in their garage, Toller takes it and promises to counsel Michael about it. Mary and Toller discuss going to the police, but Toller feels Michael's state would be dramatically worsened. Just before their next appointment, Michael sends Toller a text message asking to meet in a local park, the reverend arrives and finds Michael dead from a self-inflicted shotgun wound. In accordance with Michael's will and testament, a service is held at a local toxic-waste dump, where his ashes are scattered. Meanwhile, plans are underway to celebrate the sesquicentennial (150th anniversary) of First Reformed with a service attended by the mayor, governor, and industrialist Edward Balq (Michael Gaston), a financial backer of Abundant Life. At a meeting in a diner, Toller argues with Balq over climate change after honouring Michael's will, but Toller sees it as a straightforward matter of Christian stewardship. Experiencing various physical pains, Toller reluctantly sees a doctor (Gary Lee Mahmoud), who suspects stomach cancer and schedules tests. Toller uses Michael's laptop, which he took after his suicide to prevent the police discovering his radicalism and making trouble for Mary. He researches Michael's concerns further, including the materials which inspired him to make the explosive vest. Mary visits Toller, he begs her not to attend the anniversary service. Preparing for his role in the ceremony, Toller puts on the explosive vest, and arms it, but removes it when he sees that Mary is attending it. He instead wraps himself in barbed wire under his alb, then prepares to drink a lethal dose of drain cleaner, but Mary interrupts him, the two embrace, kissing passionately. Also starring Cedric the Entertainer as Jeffers and Victoria Hill as Esther. Hawke hives an interesting performance as the kid, open and thoughtful but emotionally and mentally disturbed pastor, and there is good support from Cedric Kyles, aka the Entertainer, and Seyfried. It is simple enough concept, a priest struggling with his conscience and religion as many things going on put him under pressure and his mental state and world crumbles down, and the minimal score by Brian Williams works well, I will admit I found it a bit too slow at times, but it gets your attention at the right moments, it is a powerful enough contemporary drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for Paul Schrader. Good!",First Reformed

7,evanston_dad,"""Taxi Driver"" for a New Generation",10,12 October 2018,"I watched ""A Quiet Place"" and thought it was pretty satisfyingly scary. Then I watched ""Hereditary"" and was suitably creeped out. Then I watched ""First Reformed"" and was scared out of my pants.Who knew that ""First Reformed"" would end up being the best horror movie of the year? Director Paul Schrader, who scripted the original ""Taxi Driver,"" the legendary Martin Scorsese film from 1976, dusts off some of the preoccupations of that earlier film and gives us an updated version that's more in tune with our troubled current times. Scorsese's film was about Vietnam and the mental toll it took on those who served in it. Travis Bickle, played so memorably by Robert De Niro, fought for his country and then was unceremoniously dumped back into the middle of NYC and its urban decay. He appointed himself a righteous avenging angel, determined to clean up the streets of the immorality and sleaze he saw there. His taxi was his church, and in his isolation his feverish thoughts and fantasies turned into his own twisted version of reality.In ""First Reformed,"" the conflict is the Gulf War rather than Vietnam, and the church is an actual church, in this case presided over by a priest who turned to the cloth after he lost his son in Iraq. Then a series of incidents with an environmental activist parishioner triggers a kindred activist spark in the priest that goes haywire, and he decides the way to prove his faith is to make mankind atone for the raping of God's creation, planet Earth.Ethan Hawke gives a tremendous performance in this film, perhaps the best of his career. The film is one sustained note of dread, and it's incredibly bleak. It poses the question, ""Is it morally justifiable to bring a child into this world knowing that that we're in the process of destroying it?"" And as a father of two young boys it made me extremely uncomfortable to admit that it's probably not.The ending of this film will likely enrage some and enrapture others. I can't talk too much without spoiling it, but I thought it was brilliant. One of the major themes of the movie is the choice we must make between hope and despair, and I can't think of a better way to make that point than by making us have to choose how this movie actually ends.""First Reformed"" crawled into my head and has stayed there haunting it for days. I might see movies I like more yet this year, but I can't imagine I'll see many that have had quite the same impact.Grade: A+",First Reformed
8,ferguson-6,soul searching,8,1 June 2018,"Greetings again from the darkness. ""A crisis of faith"" is merely the tip of the theological iceberg in this gripping, thought-provoking, debate-inspiring oddity from legendary filmmaker Paul Schrader. Mr. Schrader has long specialized in messed up/conflicted gents struggling in a world-gone-wrong in films like HARDCORE (1979), AMERICAN GIGOLO (1980), AFFLICTION (1997), and AUTO FOCUS (2002). Of course he is best known for his TAXI DRIVER (1976) and RAGING BULL (1980) screenplays. This latest is his best work in years, though few will likely describe it as entertaining. Ethan Hawke digs deep in his performance as Toller, a former military Chaplain now relegated to caretaker for a small church whose historical marker informs us was organized in 1767 and built in 1802. Although Toller has a very small congregation, the church itself is now mostly a tourist stop and throwback to the days of rural community churches. Thanks to Toller reading us his daily journal entries, we know that he is already dealing with doubt and grief even before Mary (whose name is no coincidence) approaches him about speaking with her husband Michael (Philip Ettinger). Toller's teetering emotional stability is further jolted by a mesmerizing talk with Michael, whose work as an environmental activist/extremist leaves him unable to reconcile bringing a child into this doomed world ... despite his wife Mary (an excellent Amanda Seyfried) being pregnant. (Though no further proof is needed that I should never offer counseling to confused folks, I couldn't help but wonder why Toller didn't challenge Michael on why he risks having sex if he is so adamant against making a baby.)With Michael's global and societal warnings piling on Toller's personal tragedy and disintegrated marriage, he sinks deeper into his funk and deeper into the bottle. There is also the pressure of the upcoming 250 year reconsecration ceremony and the expectations of Abundant Life's Pastor Jeffers (Cedric the Entertainer in perfect casting). Abundant Life stands in for all of the mega-churches that specialize in money grabbing these days (more business than religion). Here, big money is represented by billionaire industrialist Edward Balq (played by a less than patient Michael Gaston). He is truly the higher power in this relationship. Toller explains to us that we hold both hope and despair in our thoughts, and that these are life itself. He has an intensity towards life and his role in the church that would make most uncomfortable, if not a bit frightened of and for him. And those concerns would be quite accurate. Some people are just never comfortable in their own skin, and these are often the most intriguing movie characters. Schrader and Hawke ensure that Toller is every bit of that and more. It's a bleak story with some dark and twisted humor, and it's shot in old style ratio which adds an element of harshness to every moment. Austere might be the best one word description of the look captured by Schrader, but the story is sure to generate some colorful and intense post-viewing debate ... with an open for interpretation ending being the cherry on top. Welcome back Mr. Schrader and kudos to Mr. Hawke.",First Reformed
9,deloudelouvain,Overrated,4,16 October 2018,"As a convinced atheist I wasn't too sure about watching this movie but the high ratings made me want to give it a go. But in the end it's clear that this movie is just overrated. The story starts interesting even with all the religious bull, and it looks like something is going to happen, but in the end it's just a major letdown with an incredible stupid ending. And for that the movie doesn't deserve more than a mediocre four star rating. Nothing bad to say about the acting though. That was all fine. Ethan Hawke played his character perfectly. As well as the rest of the cast. In conclusion, First Reformed has a good cast, a load of religious crap, and a story with a waste of time ending.",First Reformed
10,namashi_1,Paul Schrader Returns To Top-Form With A Spiritual Spell-Binder! Ethan Hawke Is Astonishing!,9,2 August 2018,"Paul Schrader is at his most powerful & angered in 'First Reformed'. This stunningly unsettling spiritual drama, finds the director adapting themes with hard-hitting honesty. And Leading-Man Ethan Hawke delivers the performance of his career.'First Reformed' follows a Protestant minister faced with questions of faith and morality while serving as a pastor of a dwindling historical church.'First Reformed' is about a man who questions his own faith & morality, after life & circumstances around him, give him no choice but to think. Rev. Ernst Toller, the protagonist, is a troubled, shaken man, who represents god with genuine faith and watching him questioning his very own ideals & ideologies, makes for a deeply affecting & absorbing experience. Schrader attacks the Trump Administration & reminds us how climate change is real & the future near us is bleak, while also questions God & its Preachers, to know if their practices still have a place in this ghastly world. Schrader's inner anger & bravery reflect in 'First Reformed' to outstanding effect. I don't want to give away any more spoilers ahead, as here is a film that is actually meant to be experienced in its no-holds-barred approach. Schrader has made a film that not only resurrects him back in the game of showbiz giants, but also among the very ""ballsy"" storytellers, who aren't afraid of speaking their mind. Schrader's Direction is chilling & his Writing, spell-binding!Alexander Dynan's Cinematography captures the claustrophobic mood with excellence. Benjamin Rodriguez, Jr.'s Editing doesn't flinch to show us the darkness & remains sharp all through. Art & Costume Design are superbly done.Performance-Wise: Ethan Hawke is astonishing. The supremely talented actor surrenders to Schrader's unforgiving vision & enacts the troubled protagonist with command. The actor has never been this good before. I suspect Oscar-Chase next year! Amanda Seyfried does very well. Cedric the Entertainer, in a non comedic role, is terrific. Victoria Hill is first-rate. Philip Ettinger is remarkable in a brief role. Michael Gaston is highly competent. On the whole, 'First Reformed' is Power-Packed Cinema! An absolute must see.",First Reformed

12,Hellmant,"Similar to 'TAXI DRIVER', in story and character development, but not quite as creepy or classic.",9,8 June 2018,"'FIRST REFORMED': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The most critically acclaimed movie of the year so far is this dramatic thriller written and directed by veteran filmmaker Paul Schrader (the man who wrote 'TAXI DRIVER'). It stars Ethan Hawke as a protestant pastor who begins to doubt his faith after his son is killed while serving in the military. The film costars Amanda Seyfried, Cedric ('the Entertainer') Kyles, Victoria Hill, Michael Gaston and Philip Ettinger. I found it to be a very depressing, and dark, near masterpiece. Toller (Hawke) is a protestant preacher, and former military chaplain, who's been slowly losing his faith ever since the death of his son (who enlisted in the military at his encouragement). His spiritual doubts are further complicated when a young woman, named Mary (Seyfried), asks him to council her husband, Michael (Ettinger). Mary's husband is an extremely depressed environmentalist, who's severely troubled by his knowledge of global warming, and the thought of bringing a child into our destructive world. Toller's depression hits a breaking point when he fails to help the young couple, and blames himself for their sudden tragedy.The movie is similar to 'TAXI DRIVER', in story and character development, but not quite as creepy or classic. It's still definitely disturbing though, and Hawke is outstanding in the lead. The global warming theme is very relatable, and effective as well. It's a near flawless film, and definitely not a feel good movie obviously. So be prepared to be left extremely disturbed by it, with very little life hopefulness or happiness left in you.",First Reformed
13,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Powerful, quietly bulldozing character driven drama",9,3 February 2019,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningReverand Ernst Teller (Ethan Hawke) is one of the pastors at the First Reformed church in Upstate New York, which also serves as a tourist attraction with its roots in the slave history. A quiet, isolated man, his life is turned upside down when he is visited by Mary (Amanda Seyfried), a young woman who is concerned about the state of mind of her ecological activist husband Michael (Phillip Ettinger), who wants her to have an abortion of their unborn child, as he can't bear to bring it into a world he thinks is doomed. After a tragic event, Teller finds himself drawn down a dark and morbid path which could prove fateful for all.Considered, thoughtful cinema that leaves a lasting impression on the mind seems to be vanishing from the big screen in a manner never before seen, as in the case of writer/director Paul Schrader's latest offering First Reformed, which enjoyed only a minor release in theatres, before disappearing altogether. Not such a problem, as the small screen serves to offer it a more personal, intimate and therefore more effective viewing experience. A powerful character study, it's driven by their motivations, desires and fears, with Hawke's Reverend Teller serving as a modern day incarnation of Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver.While Bickle was on a mission simply to rid the streets of all the degeneracy he saw, Teller, as a pastor, is guided by his perception of moral righteousness and duty. It's an interesting variation on essentially the same character, and Hawke handles the role with a quiet nuance and subtle undertone. Seyfried is also impressive as the wife, resigned to her husband's personal oddities. Both are served well by an extended supporting cast, including Cedric the Entertainer, Ettinger and Victoria Hill in vital side line roles.In a modern cinematic world bombarded with loud, meaningless nonsense, it's wonderful when a small, independent film like this comes along, and works all the better because of it, a film littered with cold, lonely, lingering, shots that hauntingly capture the dark, eerie mood it's trying to convey. There's little in the way of humour or light, but it will sweep you up no less. ****",First Reformed
14,MOscarbradley,Not one of Schrader's better films.,7,6 January 2019,"Perhaps the only real surprise about Paul Schrader's ""First Reformed"" is that he didn't make it sooner, considering his Calvinistic background and his penchant for serving up Old Testament sermons in the guise of 20th Century Morality Tales full of the sex, violence, and fury he apparently is railing against. ""First Reformed"" is no different; near the end there's even a nod towards ""Taxi Driver"" as Ethan Hawkes' tortured minister drives through his town at night. Actually, the whole second half is a virtual remake of ""Taxi Driver"", Schrader's first great screenplay, just as the first half is like a remake of both Bergman's ""Winter Light"" and Bresson's ""Diary of a Country Priest"" and with a very distinct Scandinavian feel to it, (there are a lot of white wooden buildings and a lot of vast rooms, sparsely furnished like the empty spaces in the lives of its protagonists).Hawkes is the Rev. Toller who has never quite got over the death of his son in Iraq. He may be dying of cancer and spends his nights drinking and recording his doubts in a journal. One day a young woman, (Amanda Seyfried), asks him to speak to her husband who is suffering from depression. The encounter triggers a series of events that turns the film into a kind of ecological thriller, a twist I felt a bit too neat seeing we are in Trump's America.It's certainly not a bad film, just a very obvious one. I think I would have preferred it had it simply been a remake of ""Winter Light"" or ""Diary of a Country Priest"" but by drawing attention to his own work in such a blatant fashion Schrader diminishes the film's effect and yet at the same time part of me quite liked the thriller element he introduces as well as the streak of black humor running through the picture. Hawkes is excellent and all the supporting players are fine but even with these touches of humor this isn't an easy watch nor, sadly, is it one of Schrader's better films.",First Reformed
15,ThomasDrufke,Shades of Taxi Driver,7,10 June 2018,"From the writer of Taxi Driver comes First Reformed, a film about a priest in a small church whose life begins to unravel after a member of his church brings a new worldview upon him, and what follows is a psychological thriller about faith, morality, and how a simple little idea can change anyone. In the same ways that Taxi Driver conveys a change in thought by haunting narration, First Reformed presents a man in a mid-life crisis of faith and understanding, all while trying to run a church and show the exact opposite psyche to his followers. It's a fascinating prospect to have, being that he's supposed to show that he has a firm grasp on his current reality. Hawke will be in the running for an Oscar for his stirring performance, and the unsettling movie around his performance may very well be too. 7.3/10",First Reformed
16,gbill-74877,Cui bono? Who profits?,8,4 February 2020,"The starting point of this film is certainly Ingmar Bergman's 'Winter Light' - in both films, the priest of a small church speaking to a handful of worshippers is approached by a pregnant woman whose husband is distraught over a crisis which threatens the world. In both films, the priest is a war veteran who is dealing with his own spiritual doubts and angst, and who cruelly rebuffs his former lover (or wife). In both films, the woman's husband commits suicide out of despair. The film is an update of Bergman's work and maybe at a perfect time, as the threat of nuclear annihilation has transitioned to the more imminent threat of global warming in this generation.The early scene between the priest (the brilliant Ethan Hawke) and the troubled young man was incredible, and really shook me. The man lays out his reasons for despair, and the ethical problem of bringing a child into this world. The priest listens and responds thoughtfully, saying among other things:""Courage is the solution to despair. Reason provides no answers. I can't know what the future will bring. We have to choose despite uncertainty. Wisdom is holding two contradictory truths in our mind, simultaneously: hope and despair. A life without despair is a life without hope. Holding these two ideas in our head is life itself.""I identified with the points both men made, and it's easily a five star scene for me. Some other bits that stuck out for me in what follows:The need for organized religion to be a leader on climate change and be a force in social progress as it has been in its best moments, from Jesus rejecting material wealth to the priest's church having served as a way station for the Underground Railroad.The role of big business and their powerful hold over the status quo, despite the environmental damage we see all around us - contributions to the priest's church, and as we know, contributions to Washington. ""I mean, who benefits? Cui bono? Who profits? That's what I keep asking myself,"" the priest says in his interior monologue.That beautiful moment of touching between Hawke and Amanda Seyfried's characters. Even when we're communing so closely with another person and feeling as one with the universe, we cannot escape thoughts of what we've done to our planet, and what it means to our descendants.The Thomas Merton references. He was a Catholic priest who was refreshingly non-dogmatic and open-minded to other paths to spiritual enlightenment, reading and writing books on Eastern philosophies and religions.It's in these things - the courage to stand up, and in love and tolerance for others - that we have our only chance. The film is brutally honest in its solemn despair over the reality we find ourselves in, but I kind of wish a little more of this hope had found its way into the script. Also while it's interesting to frame it from the perspective of a priest and religious faith at a time when faith is so hard to hold on to, I think the question is not ""Will God forgive us?"", but ""Will our children forgive us?"" which I find much more powerful.",First Reformed
17,westsideschl,Religion is Silent On?,8,7 September 2018,"We have a juxtaposition of ""Abundant Life Church"" representing all religions w/the almost total lack of religion's vocal condemnation of our human material consumption effects on the Earth.

The film presents us w/John 10:10, The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly."" The thief in this case are the false teachings of religious leaders with regard to this problem. Although Pope Francis recently has given us a few words addressing this subject.

19,zkonedog,"Interesting Themes, Even If Not Always Riveting",6,9 June 2018,"When I experience the magic of film (whether in the cinema or in my own living room), I want (first and foremost) to be entertained. This can take many forms, obviously, such as exhilaration, thoughtfulness, education, etc., but at the end of the day I want to have experienced some kind of emotional reaction. While reading some promotional material about ""First Reformed"", I learned that director Paul Schrader set about making the film with one express goal in mind: sparsity. Schrader wanted to tell the best story possible stripped down to everything but the ""bare bones"". While in one sense I would say that Schrader succeeds in that objective (""First Reformed"" is filled with very rich characters and themes), that sparse approach will never vault this one to the top of my personal best-of lists.For a basic plot summary, ""First Reformed"" focuses on Toller (Ethan Hawke), a Reverend at a historic old church that, truth be told, is more of a museum than a congregation when we see it. One day, Toller is asked by parishioner Mary (Amanda Seyfried), recently pregnant, to speak to her husband Michael (Phillip Ettinger), who is plagued by depression over climate-change anxieties. Shortly after their conversation, Michael is found dead via suicide, the act of which has a profound affect on Toller, who himself is dealing with power/morality struggles in both his personal and professional life, especially as it pertains to the neighboring thriving church led by a more charismatic (and potentially corrupt) pastor (Cedric Kyles).There is definitely no shortage of themes and symbolism in ""First Reformed"", which make it an experience ripe for contemplation and perhaps even repeated viewers. Much of the film plays out without the camera moving at all, lingering long on character faces/reactions or spending long periods of time focused on conversations.I think the same thing can be said for the acting performances. The performances are good across the board, but even in them there seems to be a large element of restrain. Whereas the expectation is that we are going to see a ton of emotion displayed (as these characters are dealing with highly-charged situations), the reality is that it really doesn't seem to happen until the final 10-15 minutes. So, while odd for me to list this ""complaint"" (as I'm usually a pretty big fan of slower-paced movies), I think the biggest problem I had with ""First Reformed"" is that I wanted it to ""tell me how I should feel"" (to quote the director in an interview) even just every once in awhile. I wanted a swell of music, an emotional montage, or some vigorous movement to remind me that I wasn't just watching real-life play out. By admission, ""First Reformed"" is never going to be that type of film. Instead, we actually even get a weird meta-physical scene in the middle of the movie that features some odd special effects.Now, don't get me wrong: this isn't a bad film by any means. It brings up many interesting issues to contemplate about climate change anxieties, moral/religious stances, and the power of relationships. The ending is also very much a conversation-starter once you get past its abruptness. What it comes down to, however, in terms of individual like of ""First Reformed"", is how much sparseness you can stomach in a film.

This isn't a mainstream film and is more so a film for acquired taste. Even with a slower pace, the film remain an entertaining watch due to its themes, its great acting (mainly from Ethan Hawke) and its unpredictability.Many complaints is about the final ending, where we see Ethan Hawke and Amanda Seyfried'a charaxter start to hug then kiss for a while, then the screen just turns black and it ends.

21,howard.schumann,A priest torn between hope and despair,9,24 June 2018,"In a day where some churches feel that the larger donation you make, the closer you will be to God, and where the biggest donors are the ones despoiling the planet, there are several choices you can make: Blow yourself up and take some transgressors with you, accept it and internalize your despair, or find grace even in the most unlikely places. That is the dilemma facing Reverend Ernst Toller (Ethan Hawke, ""Maudie"") in Paul Schrader's (""The Canyons"") First Reformed, the story of a lonely, tormented priest seeking redemption for the sins he believes threaten the world. In his latest film, the writer of such iconic film classics as ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Raging Bull,"" and ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" pays homage to austere filmmakers of the past such as Robert Bresson, Ingmar Bergman, and Andrei Tarkovsky while adding his own touch of melodrama.Like Travis Bickle, the mentally disturbed loner in ""Taxi Driver"" who turns to violence thinking it will make the world a better place, the gaunt, sickly Toller wrestles with how to respond to the possibility that the Earth is facing environmental catastrophe. Shot by Alexander Dynan (""Franca: Chaos and Creation""), the film begins as the camera zeroes in on a pristine white Dutch Reformed Church in upstate New York. Toller is the pastor of the church that was once part of the network known as the Underground Railroad, a safe house used to protect slaves headed to Canada. Unfortunately, the church now has sparse attendance and is more of a souvenir shop and tourist attraction than a place of worship.A nearby church, Abundant Life Ministries, led by the charismatic Pastor Jeffers (Cedric the Entertainer, ""Barbershop: The Next Cut""), and Ed Balq (Michael Gaston, ""Bridge of Spies""), a wealthy conservative industrialist, constitutes the main support for First Reformed and is the biggest donor for their 250th anniversary celebration. Searching for the meaning of life after his son was killed in the Iraq War, Father Toller carries with him the burden of having persuaded the boy to enlist and the sadness of his marriage breakup after his son's death.He writes daily in the journal that he intends to burn after one year, conveying his thoughts and feelings about his struggles, his words conveyed to us in voiceover. Meaning comes to Toller in the person of Michael (Philip Ettinger, ""Indignation""), an environmental activist who has just been released from prison for protesting assaults on the environment. Toller's meeting with Michael was arranged by his wife Mary (Amanda Seyfried, ""Love the Coopers""), a young pregnant woman frightened because her husband says that he wants to ""kill the baby,"" a disparaging reference to abortion. In a riveting discussion with Michael, in which the activist details scientists concern for the future ecological stability of the world, Father Toller discovers that he is uncertain about his own feelings and struggles to understand why Michael does not want to bring a child into the world.He is soon convinced, however, that God is angry about how humans are treating the planet and is ready to translate his feelings into action. The problem becomes more urgent when Mary discovers a suicide vest that Michael has built and confides in Toller that she is frightened about what his plans may entail. As Toller's health deteriorates, Reverend Jeffers and Esther (Victoria Hill, ""Boys in the Trees""), the leader of the choir at Abundant Life and a former relationship, become concerned. Toller must now come face to face, not only with his health issues, but with the ramifications of a sudden traumatic event.As the relationship between Mary and Toller become closer, in one scene, they lie face to face and experience a levitating spiritual epiphany, a lovely journey that takes them far beyond the Earth and allows them to put the stars in their pocket, capture Orion and dance among the Pleiades. As Schrader describes it, it is ""that parallel world that we know is there but can't see . . . a world right next to these characters, running right alongside of them, which they can almost reach out and touch."" Unfortunately, the experience is fleeting and the depressed Toller contemplates a radical way out. First Reformed is a bleak film but it is one that challenges us to confront issues that many filmmakers would rather avoid - what does it mean to be human?Does our life have any meaning other than the one we ascribe to it? As the distraught priest, Ethan Hawke brings a tender humanity to the role, capturing the essence of a man torn between hope and despair. Perhaps the film that it most resembles is Robert Bresson's 1951 masterpiece ""Diary of a Country Priest,"" based on the novel by Georges Bernanos. In that film, the Curé d'Ambricourt, a young Catholic priest assigned to a small country parish, is dying of stomach cancer and can only consume bread and wine. Rejected by his flock who think he is a drunk, the priest never loses his faith, the purity of his spirit, and his love of God, ultimately achieving the luminous awareness that grace is everywhere.Like the Curé, Reverend Toller is challenged to discover that basing one's actions on anger and self pity cannot solve the world's problems, and that it is only love which is, to quote author Kevin Williams, ""the very essence of being, the single point of infinite light, and the very life force of the universe.""",First Reformed

Unfortunately I only know of very FEW movies that make global warming the main subject of their story, because you wont sell many tickets with it. Besides this global warming theme it is still a good drama, although only suited for an arthouse audience.Director and writer Paul Schrader (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull) is known for his independent stance of views. His movies are never standard formula hollywood stuff and are always causing divided opinion, although he is still considered to be one of the greatest writers of American independent cinema.This movie tells the story of a vicar (Ethan Hawke) who is deeply conflicted with himself in what he ought or ought not to do to protect the world from future destruction by global warming. His worry about the future of our planet has deepened ever since an environmental activist, who had sought the vicar's advice, had killed himself. Amanda Seyfriend plays the girlfriend of the deceased activist.It's a personal portrait of a vicar who tries to live according to the gospel of Jesus. Should the vicar give his life for the sins of others? Should he turn the other cheek and do nothing? Or should he rise up and resist those who try to destroy the weak and the poor?This story may sound as an extremely religious movie, but it's not.

25,paul-allaer,So(m)ber movie about morality and religion,8,9 June 2018,"""First Reformed"" (2017 release; 113 min.) brings the story of Reverend Toller. As the movie opens, Toller, who leads the First Reformed Church in a small community in upstate New York, decides to keep a diary. At the church service, there is hardly anyone there. But a young couple approaches Toller. The wife asks Toller to counsel her husband, dealing with anger and environmental activist issues. Toller agrees. Meanwhile, preparations are under way for the 250th anniversary of First Reformed, and Toller is having a hard time keeping up with everything... At this point we're about 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comment: this is the most recent opus from noted, if not legendary, writer-director Paul Schrader, who rose to the top with scenarios like Taxi Driver (which he wrote in his late 20s) and Raging Bull, and directing films like American Gigolo and Cat People. While Schrader has continued to write and direct movies these past 4 decades, it's been quite a while since he has written or directed a high-profile movie, but with ""First Reformed"", Schrader hits a home run/ There are so many remarkable things about the movie, including the all-out so(m)ber setting and style (refeclting the Spartan life-style of Reverend Toller), the unusual screen ratio (not quite 1:1, but it's close), the sparse lighting, the quasi complete absence of a score (but the little music there is, is fabulous--courtesy of ambient composer Lustmord), etc. And we haven't even mentioned the commanding performance by Ethan Hawke (as Toller), who seems to simply get better as he gets older. Amanda Seyfriend (as Marty, the young wife) is quite good as well. Yet for all of its unusualness, there are also some very Schrader-reminding aspects, none more so than the heavy emphasis in the script on the interplay (or is it the tension?) between morality and religion. The last 45 min. of the movie are nothing short of riveting (for me anyway). Just watch!""First Reformed"" premiered at last year's Venice Film Festival, to immediate and universal critical praise. I couldn't wait to see it, and the movie FINALLY opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was not attended well (about 10 people), to my surprise and disappointment. Hopefully the strong word of mouth, which this movie surely will generate, will help getting this movie to wider audience.If you are a fan of Paul Schrader, you won't want to miss this movie, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.

27,jtindahouse,"Bold, smart, daring and heart-breaking",9,17 December 2018,"My initial impression of 'First Reformed' after the first 15 minutes or so was that it was simply going to be a character study. Which is fine, and always a great opportunity for an actor to give a memorable performance, but can be a little dry to watch if not done correctly. As the film went along though I realised that it was so much more. This was a film that had something to say, and it was going to do everything it had to to be heard.Of all the things I loved about this film, and they were plentiful, I think it was how thoughtful it was. It challenges its audience to think outside their comfort zone. The amount of utterly brilliant quotes this film possesses is incredible. There are almost too many of them to fully appreciate.Ethan Hawke gives an amazing performance here. There isn't a single scene (or moment for that matter) where he drops out of character. The balance he found between displaying the pain he was in and also the fact that he was trying to hide it was nothing short of masterful. I'd be very surprised if his name is not in the mix come Oscar season.The film has quite a unique ending. I absolutely loved it, however I could see how some may not. It's very hard to be both bold and please everybody - check that, it's impossible to do. The ending for me though was the icing on the cake. The work of a genius. I said to myself please let the credits roll right now (not because I wanted it to be over, but because it would be the perfect ending) and they did. 'First Reformed' is an amazing film that I hope people take the time to see because it thoroughly deserves every bit of attention it gets.",First Reformed
28,Turfseer,"Schrader's troubled Reverend is a derivative portrait based on Bresson's ""Diary of a Country Priest""",3,30 June 2018,"Desperate for anything resembling intellectual cinema, the critics fawned over noted writer/director Paul Schrader's latest offering, an homage to iconic French director Robert Bresson's ""Diary of a Country Priest."" If you'll recall, Schrader in his younger days was known as being the screenwriter for Scorsese's acclaimed ""Taxi Driver,"" an insipid tale about a miscreant who is held up as a hero as a result of a penchant for vigilantism. Worse was one of the most overrated films of all-time, ""Raging Bull,"" another of Scorsese's early failures in which Schrader turned a colorful pugilist into an angry martinet.
 
 Like Woody Allen before he stopped acting in his own films, Schrader seeks international recognition as a ""deeper"" kind of filmmaker, a la Ingmar Bergman. What better way to accomplish that than emulate an iconic ""foreign"" director such as Bresson?
 
 Like Bresson's unnamed country priest, Schrader's protagonist, Reverend Ernst Toller (Ethan Hawke) is also an outsider, who seeks to do things his own way, bent on proving to congregants that his brand of spirituality is far more ""real"" and credible than the kind of religion peddled by the likes of Pastor Jeffers (played by Cedric the Entertainer of all people!). Jeffers is the head of the nearby Abundant Life mega-church which basically owns and operates Toller's First Reformed congregation in upstate New York as a tourist attraction (due to its connection as a site for the Underground Railroad).
 
 In Bresson's ""Diary,"" the priest also has a mentor, the Priest of Torcy, who like Jeffers, attempts to mold his charge into a respectable spiritual counselor. Both Bresson's Priest and Toller are moralists and can't keep their big mouths shut. In Toller's case, it's his encounter with the troubled environmental activist, Michael, whose shocking suicide convinces Toller that he's been living a life of inaction (if only he could live up to the example set by Jesus and his ministry).
 
 Just as Bresson's Priest piously blames a landowner for the trouble he's having with his daughter (a potential runaway) due to an ill-advised extramarital affair, Toller blames the mean-spirited industrialist Edward Balq for his less than progressive views on climate control. Both the landowner and Balq have been funding their respective churches, so when each man of faith voices his displeasure, their superiors are not pleased at all. The bottom line is that the antagonists in both Bresson's and Schrader's passion play are decidedly one-dimensional.
 
 Bresson's priest and Toller are also joined at the hip by the respective illnesses they suffer from. Both apparently are facing some kind of stomach cancer which lead them both to adopt the mantle of a martyr.
 
 But Schrader's character's road to martyrdom takes a far more absurd turn when the giving, mild-mannered Reverend suddenly decides to wear the deceased Michael's suicide belt and blow himself up during the 250th anniversary convocation at the First Reformed church-with Balq, the governor of NY State and Pastor Jeffers all in attendance.  Schrader still believes he can win a few additional critics' accolades by channeling his inner Travis Bickle (his Taxi Driver protagonist), proffering a tawdry scene of nihilistic violence. But better to have his troubled Reverend ultimately take the high road-here Toller dispenses with the suicide vest after Michael's widow, Mary, arrives at the church (against his instructions) and prevents him from swallowing a can of drain cleaner. There is still an intermediary step toward partial martyrdom-Toller wears barbed wire, mimicking Christ's wearing of the Crown of Thorns before the Crucifixion. But wait! This could have been merely an alternative dream sequence proffered by Schrader. Note that Pastor Jeffers could not get into the rectory next door to the church so how did Mary get in? Either way, both endings make no sense. Despite an intense performance by Ethan Hawke, the noted thespian is undone by the ridiculousness of Schrader's script. Indeed it is a script that is wholly derivative, based on source material that is obviously superior to this paltry imitation, but overrated in its own right. Schrader even after all these years must resort to titillating his audience through the suggestion of puerile violent wish fulfillment (here it's the anti-environmentalists who must get their comeuppance). Just as unlikely as the Reverend's sudden murderous rage is the completely unconvincing turnaround-a call for love's embrace-which should have been the good Reverend's stance all along.",First Reformed

Mikey is a fervent environmentalist who does not want to bring a baby into this dying planet. The rev gives him a pep talk. The inspirational talk is not successful and tragic events lead to some deep soul searching by the local minister. The enemy is a thinly disguised Koch brother type who is what we call a climate change denier. Paul Schraeder has obviously done his homework on the subject. Of course, those in the audience who listen to the Limbaugh's, Hannity's and Levin's of talk radio will hate this film, but hey, wake up people of earth; we are in deep trouble.

30,jadavix,"Good, with a too-crazy ending",7,21 December 2018,"With ""Taxi Driver"", Paul Schrader made a movie that was clearly inspired by Bresson's ""Diary of a Country Priest"". Both films were about increasingly isolated men who kept journals documenting their mental (and, with ""Priest"", physical) disintegration.""First Reformed"" is almost like a remake of the latter, with unnecessary nods to the former. It's also about a seriously ill clergyman who keeps a journal, which is read to us in voiceover. This one is tormented by the death of his son, who died in Iraq, and is approached by a young married man who is convinced we are going to lose the world to climate change.The movie becomes more incoherent as it goes on, when the reverend becomes less like the country priest than the New York taxi driver.

Hawke's performance is commanding, perhaps the best of his career, and he should be noticed come award season. The movie is brimming with tension of all kinds, leaving the ending a surprise until the last moment. And that leads to the one caveat - the ending. It almost feels as if Paul Schrader (who also directed) didn't finish the script. Sometimes an abstract ending works, but here it just left me baffled.

Having counselled Mary's husband, he sends a text to Ernst asking him to meet him at a specified location, but when Ernst arrives Mary's husband is dead. Mary's husband's death causes Ernst's life to gradually begin to spiral out of control as well as unearthing some demons from his past...Whilst Schrader's intention here was clearly to be heartfelt, deep, and meaningful what this film actually comes across as is dull, wearying, cumbersome and ever so slightly pretentious. It's actually incredible to think that a film so boring could have come from the same man that was responsible for the screenplays for Raging Bull and Taxi Driver. Having said that I can see some parallels; there's a character study here, but whereas the aforementioned films simmered, bubbled and boiled First Reformed kind of just simmers for a long time and then just goes Pop. Taxi Driver was a superb film and despite having mixed feelings about Raging Bull I could still recognise it as a good character study, but with First Reformed I just wasn't feeling it.Credit where credit's due and I have to say that Ethan Hawke was fantastic in his role and was credible through every stage of the journey. Although I've never personally been a big fan of Seyfried I thought she handled the emotional scenes extremely well and found her to be a good fit with Hawke.But yeah that's about the only positive I can take from this film. Other than that the film bored me to tears and if I missed anything then it was probably because I was in a concussed state that saw me both drifting in and out of consciousness and watching paint dry (both of which were far more interesting than this film). Some may say that the film spoke to them well if that's the case then if it was speaking to me then at best it was talking in another language and at worst it was lisping.",First Reformed

Now he has a crisis of faith and it looks as if may be seriously ill.

First Reformed's 250th anniversary of it's founding is coming up and that is it's only real importance to it's Mother Church.One of Toller's parishioners, Mary (Amanda Seyfried) asks him to counsel her husband Michael (Philip Ettinger) who has negative feelings about her pregnancy due to his pessimism over environmental issues. Enst meets with Michael, finds he has served a prison sentence for his activism, and an interesting debate ensues. They agree to meet again but Mary finds a suicide vest in her garage and goes to Toller who realises Michael is involved deeper and in darker actions then he first realised.Much of the film has a voiceover by Toller, putting events in context and outlining his traumas over his losses and his faltering belief in God. He is writing a journal where he sets down these musings. Thomas Merton is an inspiration to him and he is also troubled by how Abundant Life has become a megachurch which serves Mammon rather than God: while not a Prosperity Preacher, it's senior Reverend, Jeffers (Cedric Kyles) and his church is very much financially dependent on a local billionaire, Balq (Michael Gaston) who runs polluting industries. Balq objects when Toller officiates at a memorial service for a deceased environmentalist which takes place at a polluted site.Directed and written by Paul Schrader, First Reformed is about guilt, individual and mass struggles, the difference an individual can make, it is about bereavement, loss of love and ultimately redemption. Great performances from Hawke, Seyfried and Ettinger. There are plenty of flawed characters here including an interesting interpretation of Jeffers by Kyles who has compromised so that he can build a bigger enterprise providing more services but he may have supped with the devil in doing so. Powerful religious/social drama marking his 40th year as a director and dealing with some of the themes and influences of his own strict Calvinist upbringing.

36,Agent10,Is God's will really to destroy the Earth?,7,22 August 2021,"There is plenty of arguments about the role of religion when it comes to the significance of climate change and environmentalism. Many of the evangelical stock believe that the world was given to humanity by an all powerful being and thus, anything we do with the said planet must be ""his will."" Therefore, climate change is not an ecological disaster but God's will. Water becoming scarce is not due to squandering of said resource or allowing corporations to control it, it is God's will. Eating, killing and wasting the lives of billions of land animals and billions of acres in habitat to feed said animals is not an unsustainable model of food production, it is God's will.However, there is a competing regiment of religious folk who believe in the first lines of Genesis that God gave us the Earth to manage and protect it, and only when we thought we were smarter and equal to God did the end of The Garden of Eden come about. These two competing realities are difficult to discuss with in a mixed religious family that falls under different political lines. The typical comeback of ""what if we save the world for nothing"" or ""what about jobs"" is a usual retort, and it makes for a rather head shaking realization on the subject. First Reformed contextualizes this argument in the differences between Father Toller's First Reformed Church and Reverand Jeffers Abundant Life Mega Church.Toller's church is merely a prop for Abundant Life, and Toller is beginning to realize this as his own life is becoming more complicated. It's the same realization someone would have in regards to a mega corporation claiming they will initiate more ""green"" methods of production and manufacture to gain favor with the public. The same can be said about mega churches, which at the base level are money making enterprises well before they are the pulpit for the teaching of the good lord. Let's just say, the supposed mission statement of the organization is not the first rung on the ladder.It's kind of a cool allegory to see this in action. Many directors have had issues with their faith and placed it on screen, whether it was Darren Aronofski's battle with his Jewish faith in Pi, Martin Scorsese's issues with catholicism in The Last Temptation of Christ or the entirety of Abel Ferrera's career, perhaps this was Paul Schrader's entry into this paradigm of film making.Father Toller is definitely a man in an existential crisis. He is struggling not with just faith but with loneliness. He is dealing with the lack of authenticity within his own religion and has no way to solve these issues. He is certainly descending down a dark path and the beginning of that path could be the rather strange and beautiful ending. If you understand the political machinations of religion and environmentalism, then this will be a good film for you.",First Reformed

I was expecting some sort of period piece, not a captivating story of one man's struggle with ethics, himself and the changing world around him and his place within it. It's simple, really only taking place in a handful of small locations and a short roster of main actors that dominate the screen time and yet it was hard to take my eyes off of it. Hawke is really spectacular here, delivering a complex, layered performance that matches the depths of the role he's stepping into. Seyfried was also pretty impressive here, I feel like I've given her short shrift in the past and I'm realizing that's been unfair of me. It's really Schrader that impresses here though, to pull off a movie like this, purely performance driven and to excel throughout from the entire cast while also delivering some really spectacular shots.The only downside I have is that, despite pulling in at only 113 minutes, the slow and ponderous nature of the film can feel sluggish at times. I did find myself glancing at my watch once or twice. That's really the only knock against it though, with the exception of the few slow moments, this is really an exceptional film.

After the reverend talks to the young man, he goes off into the woods and shoots himself in the head with a rifle.That is the first half or so of both Winter Light by Ingmar Bergman and First Reformed by Paul Schrader. I had no idea that the connections were there when I started watching First Reformed less than a week after seeing Winter Light for the first time in 15 years, but what a marvelous coincidence.Schrader has said that Bergman was an influence on him while making this movie, and it is obvious beyond the plotting of the movie. He filmed in full screen, eschewing any wide screen formats like Bergman did. The movie is steady and slow, focused on the characters as they debate issues back and forth. Where Schrader makes the material more of his own is mainly through the differences between Tomas, the priest in Bergman's film, and Ernst, Schrader's creation.Tomas was concerned with his personal connection to God, but Ernst, instead of listening to the apocalyptic concerns of his congregant placidly like it means nothing, absorbs the lessons that his congregant espouses, becoming as much an advocate for revolutionary action regarding climate change as the congregant was. He begins the movie saying the same generically religious things to everyone, but all of the young people (including members of a youth group who feel cultural pressure to conform to a secular society) fight back rhetorically. The comforting words of God seem to hold no sway over them, and, over time, they hold no sway over Ernst. He dovetails into desiring radical action.The movie is filled with great images, at the center of which is the First Reformed church itself. A relic from the earliest years of the Republic, it's affectionately (or derisively) called the Souvenir Shop by the locals (we even see Ernst hocking some souvenirs to some tourists at one point). We can see how Ernst, intentionally isolated by both himself and by his superior (a very good Cedric the Entertainer) could begin to feel isolated against the world, and how he would need to fill that void within him with anything. God doesn't speak to him, but Ernst thinks he sees the signs through the troubled man who took his own life.Paul Schrader was always a better writer than director. His work with Scorsese led to Scorsese's career, essentially, but Schrader's films ranged from interesting to quite good. Here he raises the bar on his own work into a level of greatness that he couldn't meet before. His combination of thriller (Ernst really does feel like a cousin to Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver), religious concerns, and general strong writing come together to form his best film. It's as challenging as a Bergman, but with those distinctly American touches that make it far more than just an imitation.",First Reformed
41,jadepietro,Preachy and Overrated,4,11 September 2018,"GRADE: C- THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: A disappointing film that tackles important issues and fails.JIM'S REVIEW: Critics loved this independent film. I didn't. There is much to admire in First Reformed, from the stately photography by Alexander Dynan, fine performances by Ethan Hawke as the conflicted minister and Amanda Seyfried as his parishioner, and solid direction by Paul Schrader about the state of the world. More to hold one's interest...at least for the first hour of the film. After that, it rapidly descends into a film oddity that lacks any shred of credibility. Call it an exploration of a crisis of faith, a mental breakdown, or a political reckoning, the film hurls itself into an impassioned but silly allegory. Along the way, it goes off course in a dreamy surreal magical mystery tour of our ecological wastelands before reaching its unbelievable climax.The theme involves a minister in conflict with his God. Mr. Schrader's film examines this issue in its story of religious turmoil in a very convoluted and involving debate of good vs. evil, before the film becomes a surreal soapbox for the dangers of political radicalism and terroristic violence. The director also wrote the screenplay and his plot is as follows: Reverend Ernst Toller, religious leader of the First Reform Church, meets Mary, a female parishioner who fears her husband's erratic behavior may lead to a violent end. The priest intervenes and becomes embroiled in a personal battle of guilt, morality, and faith.An interesting enough premise, but the script only hints at the character's possible madness and his alcoholic binges. It doesn't truly explain his motives or actions in realistic terms. Much is told in voiceover narration and inferred rather than seen. As the film progresses on its unlikely (but hardly predictable)course, it loses all sense of logic. As Ethan Hawkes' character becomes unhinged and care less about the sanctity of life and more about death and destruction, this moviegoer sat there in disbelief at the heavy-handedness and absurd detour this film had taken. (It brought to mind yet another Schrader character, the irrational Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver, an earlier film classic from the mind of this director / writer. That film worked; this does not.)First Reformed is in need of a first or second, or even third rewrite. Visually, the film is so well crafted. Emotionally, it is a void. The film's message on the dangers of ecological issues, or what becomes Mr. Schrader's preachy sermon to his cinephile congregation, seems more important to the director than the film medium itself.",First Reformed
42,Amyth47,Not for mainstream audience.,7,17 November 2018,"My Rating : 7/10If you like the great filmmakers of the black and white era such as Bresson and Bergman you will enjoy 'First Reformed' as you can see direct influences from Diary of a Country Priest and Winter Light here.Made for the 2018 audience, it's a dark character study similar to what Schrader's done in Taxi Driver before. I enjoyed it for what it is and the overall slow-burning narrative.",First Reformed
43,Easygoer10,Outstanding Schrader,9,24 July 2019,"This is an outstanding film. Paul Schrader, who goes back to the days of helping Stanley Kubrick (the master of all directors) in his early years, has made or writtenso many, many brilliant films. This one is truly outstanding, and Ethan Hawke is equally brilliant in yhe lead role. He is one of America's greatest actors of his generation. He reminds me of an American version of Colin Farrell, who is an equally brilliant Irish actor. The supporting cast is great, especially Amanda Seyfried, plus a couple of additional cast members. It is a combination of Spiritual, Metaphysical and Political arcs, which are perfectly told, especially visually. I love the final 15 minutes, as I what I thought woukd occur dud not happen. Schrader tricked us all, which is why he is so great. Thete are few American durectors with his skill set; maybe a half dozen. Anyway, this is a must see film. I rated it a 9 out of 10 (8.5 would be more accurate). Superb work by all. This is why you see at least 5 or 6 films on both Ethan Hawke and Colin Farrell's list of films to be made for the next several years. Both of them catefully select their roles; and we are fortunate to have them, in this era of (what I call) ""comic book superhero movies"", in other words pablum for the masses.",First Reformed
44,pc95,Good Middle Act; slow beginning; so-so final,7,16 September 2018,"*spoilers* Paul Schaders ""First Reform"" is a good watch. About the first 20-30 min are sluggish, but the movie takes off about the time Hawke's character comes upon the suicide. From there Schrader effectively builds tension and pity for Hawke's main character. The soundtrack was effectively foreboding This Movie reminded me and had undertones from Julianne Moore's ""Safe"". Although ""Safe"" is more enigmatic and doesn't mix in religion, rather keeping the environmental sickness, this movie shows how the demise of environment shakes religious conviction. The end was a bit abrupt and highlights differences between pastors and priests.",First Reformed
45,krocheav,First Reformed - Needs Reforming On Several Levels,4,25 April 2019,"This was another movie I knew nothing about before watching, had I known it was a Paul Schrader story I may have even given it a miss. Schrader's direction is slow but stylish or maybe he left a lot of the creative, visual decisions, to his director of photography: Alexander Dynan (Dog Eat Dog). But, good looking images and performances do not atone for a clumsily developed script. The first half seemed as if it could be moving into interesting territory - before it trailed off into the now predictable ground that's getting high 'praise' of late. Mainstream critics who regard themselves as better versed than the majority of movie viewers might think this is rather arty, and see themselves among the few smart enough to 'interpret' what is really going on. To these I could say, it's very easy to read into any story what you might want to see.Overall, this comes across as little more than 'topical' propaganda with a heavy handed climate change cliché being substituted for any real character study or true depth. Take the character representing the energy companies executive - as expected; he's portrayed as the typical insensitive, aggressive bully - buying votes and support from everyone including the church officials that our local pastor (Ethan Hawk) works for. Hawk is very good in his role but his character's actions become quickly unhinged and downright foolish - right up to the somewhat laughable ending (some viewers asked, ""What happened, did the film break""? This uninspired work uses scripture based interpretations to manipulate the un-informed, and hook the lazy viewer towards its skewed viewpoints. Could it be that Mr Schrader may need to consider an overdue retirement? - his current writings seem all about recycling character elements of his earlier stories - this one is simply 'Taxi Driver' in a church setting, and somewhat poorly transposed at that.The Academy and the likes of the Scorsese's of this 'darkness obsessed' movie world - may see greatness in these often shambolic works but from the looks of the ticket-buying public, they, are not buying these ideas - so, according to box office returns many of these movies are actually more likely to end up lingering on the shelves. After jotting out these remarks, I curiously checked some other IMDb viewer reviews and had to agree with many, including the following: Sandman, PotassiumMan, and Davegipson, etc, on the first and second pages of viewer reviews ... those, and many more are all worth a read to learn more.One of the better bits, the marvellous singing voice of Julie Murney performing the old Hoffman/Showalter: 'Leaning On The Everlasting Arms' - though, it's almost wasted here, adds a haunting touch. On the technical side, why would any modern moviemaker want to go backwards? We progressed to the marvellous Wide Screen visual ratio of 16: 9 over a decade ago but Schrader chose to make this movie in 4: 3 (the old standard screen) For this films content, that decision comes across as being as foolish as elements of the story, disappointing indeed (I note some others have said they half expected to see Al Gore's name on the producer's credits, I understand what they mean!)",First Reformed
46,proud_luddite,A great start but an odd finish,7,24 July 2018,"In a small town in upstate New York, Ernst Toller (Ethan Hawke) is the minister of a small Protestant congregation that meets in a historical church that is also used as a tourist attraction. A young woman, Mary (Amanda Seyfried), asks Ernst to counsel her husband Michael (Philip Ettinger). Michael is an environmental activist in a state of depression regarding the state of the planet.There are fascinating dialogues in the film's first half. They relate Christian beliefs and spirituality not only to the troubles of modern life but also how they might relate to the care of the environment. Some shocking events also add to the intrigue of the first half which is filled with much thoughtful debate.The second half takes a strange twist in which a major character makes an astonishing decision - a decision that doesn't fully make sense. It's unfair to say this twist causes the movie to go downhill; it's more like the film was going uphill until that point and then it flattened. Yet, it still intrigues overall. Veteran director/writer Paul Schrader creates an appropriate bleak mood which matches the troubled soul of the minister who is more than ably played by Hawke - no surprise there. An interesting footnote is that there are moments when Hawke resembles Montgomery Clift who was also, sadly, a real-life troubled soul.",First Reformed
47,maurice_yacowar,Broken priest recovers faith through compassion and love,10,23 June 2018,"Like Reverend Toller's diary, this film is Paul Schrader's form of prayer. It's an attempt to find meaning, purpose and integrity in our fallen world. Our religion has been compromised by wordiness, our faith engulfed by despair. 
 Its religious core is Thomas Merton's insight: despair and hope are equally valid, indeed interdependent visions. Wisdom inheres in the ability to hold two such contrary ideas in the mind at the same time. Either without the other is incomplete, inadequate, futile.
 Like the green activist Michael (an echo of the avenging angel), Reverend Toller's idealism leads to paralysis by despair. Toller can't rebut Michael's arguments about man's abandonment of nature, of God in his world. He can only repeat Michael's question; ""Can God forgive us for what we have done to His world?"" 
 Toller is himself guilt-ridden for having sent his son off to death in the Iraq war. That broke Toller's marriage, his self-respect and his faith. Because of his feeling of futility, when Michael's wife Mary comes for help Toller's first impulse is to refer her to the more affluent super church nearby. Her persistence and Michael's suicide reawaken Toller's passion for God. But now it's in the form of trying to protect His creation instead of serving the routines of the church. Toller's plan to blow himself up at the church's reconsecration is his personal reconsecration to the proper service of God, try saving His world. 
 The plot chronicles the reverend's progression from leading his dying church to rediscovering the proper function of religion - compassion and love. 
 His brief affair with (the faithful) Esther only stirred his lust, which he now admits he despises both in her and in himself. His feelings for Mary grow slowly and more profoundly. Planning to sacrifice himself at his church's reconsecration, he demands she stay away. Her appearance aborts his plan because he can't kill her and her unborn son. Toller would sacrifice himself but not them. 
 Toller's and Mary's love develops across two scenes of intense physical engagement. In the first he obliges her request to replay her and Michael's Magical Mystery Tour. She lies flat on him on the floor, arms and hands extended so their bodies touch as much as they can, their eyes locked and moving together as they breathe together. 
 The sexual potential of that posture instead turns into a transcendental vision. They float off the floor, soar through the world into the starry skies back into the sordid image of man's ruin of God's creation. That experience inspires Toller's resolve to protest the world's corruption. 
 Their full union occurs when she comes to him from the reconsecration ceremony he is missing. Their clench and kiss overwhelm both. He has just wrapped himself in barbed wire, to atone for his dashed resolve. He bleeds through his vestments. But in the woman for whom he first felt compassion and whose tragic loss he both shared and assuaged, Toller finds his full religious service - love. 
 At that point the film just stops. The end is shocking, seemingly incomplete - indeed like the end of the last episode of that other American epic of contemporary secular calvary, The Sopranos. Is there a technical problem here? we instinctively ask.
 But of course that is Schrader's point. The couple's realized love is all either needs. The proper service to God is to mankind. The most compelling faith is human love. With that they can confront their despair, their faith and connection deepened, and stand to defend God's world against corrupt and corrupting man. 
 That's the point of Michael's funeral requests. Instead of the traditional hymn -such as the one Esther sings so archly, so unconnectedly - Toller grants Michael's request for a Neil Young ecology hymn.
 The film feels as ascetic as Toller's world. Like his stark, sparsely finished quarters, the film is stripped down. The classic square screen proportion is a harsh shrinkage of the familiar widescreen. The buildings are flat, symmetrical, stern frames. Most scenes are stripped of colour and the relief of any music, other than what the characters bring the scene. 
 For all its asceticism, though, poetry abounds. Toller declines Michael's offer of a drink, not because he's not ""a drinking man"" but because he's a drinking priest - and ""It doesn't help."" Pouring Pepto into his scotch produces a shot of a swirl of pollution where the values of purity and survival seem inextricably compromised. 
 Toller's physical suffering fleshes out his spiritual. He has a cancer. His painful and bleeding urination evoke the constipated Martin Luther's composed eruption. His plumbing is shot, as we see in his leaking hot water faucet, his plugged toilet and his own vomiting. This motif confirms the tension in man's amphibian nature, a troubled soul lumbered with a troubling body, the holy grounded in the secular.
 The hero's name evokes John Donne's reflection on the bell announcing another death: ""Ask not for whom the bell tolls. It tolls for thee."" This reverend is our toller. 
 In its intelligence, high seriousness, emotional effect and quality of realization I'd call this the best American feature film of the year (so far). 
 It is also disturbingly but bracingly timely. Released into the days of thousands of imprisoned children, slandered immigrants, betrayed asylum seekers, a burgeoning fascism, a corporate stranglehold on the government, the suicidal EPA and the tragically compromised religious Right, the film strikes straight to the heart.",First Reformed
48,aciessi,God's Wrath.,9,21 September 2020,"Pastor Ernst Toller is a reverend at the First Reformed Church. Like most reverends, he has an unshakable, undying faith in the salvation of God. For all of the world's problems, there is a hope for things to get better. Unfortunately, in Toller's own life, everything is getting worse. He lost his son in the Iraq war and he's dying of cancer. That's enough to break anyone, but Toller still powers on. But something else shakes his faith. Toller is tasked by a local woman to consult her husband, Michael, an environmental activist who's fallen into the rabbit hole of ecological despair. It is later revealed that he's an bomb-making eco-terrorist who commits suicide in a last act of desperation. Horrified that he couldn't reach him, Toller takes a deep dive into Michael's relationship and the studies that radicalized him. Toller dips his toe in the rabbit hole and falls straight in.First Reformed asks an age old question. What can shake your faith in God? Moreover, is despair more powerful than faith itself? Spiritually, this is a powerful film. It's raw, it's angry and it's frightened. What else could you expect from Paul Schrader? Harkenking back to Taxi Driver, Schrader once again plunders the darkest instincts and inclinations of humanity. His characters and their ultimate decisions remind me of that famous quote by Nietzsche ""Beware that, when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster... for when you gaze long into the abyss. The abyss gazes also into you"". Reverend Toller, like Travis Bickle before him, learns this lesson the hard way.",First Reformed
49,spookyrat1,Schrader's Blues!,6,25 April 2019,"In First Reformed writer/director Paul Schrader roams through familiar territory; mental disintegration, social alienation and the values or otherwise of religious belief. This time though he adds some more contemporary ingredients to the mix, in raising issues related to environmentalism and radicalism. Think an even more introspective Taxi Driver in a dog collar.The film is blessed (I couldn't help it) with a wonderful central performance from Ethan Hawke playing the Reverend Ernst Toller, a former military chaplain, struggling with his own personal demons, primarily it seems caused by the death of his son Joseph, who was killed in the Iraq War and his subsequent marriage breakdown. Amanda Seyfried gives fine support whose character pregnant Mary, is seeking counselling from Toller, for her radical-environmentalist husband, Michael.This independent low budget production (with 8 producers?) is unlikely to appeal to mainstream audiences seeking quick, in your face thrills, but serious viewers interested in socio-political and religious processes will undoubtedly find plenty to ponder. I think for the most part the narrative works. However I found the fundamental crux of the movie, Toller becoming self-radicalised, just very difficult to accept. Yes, we can see the constantly unsmiling clergyman has issues himself, but we're asked to believe that having one in depth discussion with an activist, combined with reading up on some mystical writers and dealing with the aftermath of a suicide, will cause him to evolve into the sort of social political warrior that we see Michael may be. For me, despite Hawke's extremely convincing performance, I just found it too difficult to believe, unlike Travis Bickle's journey in Taxi Driver, which made more sense.However let me add that I think Schrader's conclusion to the piece is a cracker. Yes, it is extremely ambiguous and as such, will annoy lots of punters. But in tendering these scenes, he does offer, arguably the first rays of optimism and a possible second chance for the troubled cleric, that we see raised in the entire film. It's unsure, but we possibly see Mary cause him to take those first few steps towards some sort of personal redemption.",First Reformed

51,AhmedSpielberg99,Even a pastor needs a pastor!,9,2 August 2018,"Paul Schrader remade Taxi Driver, but with a modern twist, message about the importance of love, Wes Anderson's symmetrical compositions, and the Coen Brothers' nihilism.If that wasn't enough praise, Ethan Hawke delivers the performance of his career. His performance in this movie reminded me of Casey Affleck's performance in Manchester By the Sea. But while Lee Chandler was already dead inside, Reverend Ernst Toller is a man in the midst of a spiritual breakdown. Definitely Hawke's performance is the best so far this year, along with Joaquin Phoenix's in You Were Never Really Here. Just look at Ethan Hawke's eyes that are full of ache, lack of faith, and unshed tears! Also, Amanda Seyfried gives her best performance since Les Misérables.I've always thought that the surreal shift in Taxi Driver could have been prepared for in a better way. This movie hasn't this surreal shift, but it has some dreamlike moments at the third act, and they are magnificent! That said, I think Paul Schrader was worried a little too much about how vaguely the final act may seem to some. As he returned to the typical form of the movie at the middle of the third act, but it didn't work very well. Nevertheless, the movie hasn't lost me for even a moment, and when it proceeded towards the end, it shook me to the core I couldn't help but look away!(9/10)",First Reformed

It was mostly reflective because the priest, played by Ethan Hawk, wrote a journal, and through the journal we understood his mental states. Because of this, there was a lot of talking, pensive thoughts, and philosophical arguments.I ain't no Christian, but I was riveted by the slow change in the character's beliefs. The dark and grim shift from forgiveness and hope to despair was terrifying. As the character encountered others, talking to them and witnessing different things about the troubled world, he became slowly but steadily more desperate, and even turned sinister. Nearer and nearer to the end, I became more anxious as I heard his calm yet subtly angry voice. It was a similar feeling to Saint Maud in that there's an impending doom of a character because of their faith, but with less horror.Ethan Hawk played the character beautifully. Most of the time he was subtle in his facial expression, but slowly he became more angry and desperate, even with a calm demeanor.Even more, the camera shots in this movie were amazing. The look of the small church outside and inside with its pure white color was holy. Also, the angles on Ethan Hawk with the glass of wine were also beautiful.As I said before, the movie became more suspenseful near the end, and the ending was a drastic one. It could have gone horrible and haunting like in Saint Maud, but instead it was ambiguous. There were two different ways to look at the ending, and the metaphorical one was beautiful yet sad at the same time.Overall, a pensive yet terrifying testament of a man who struggled with faith and the world around him. 9.5/10.",First Reformed

I guess after all the talk my expectations were just too high for it.
It did have good qualities however. First and for most: Ethan Hawke. A tremendous performance, that saved the film from becoming irrelevant. Its one of his best turns as an actor and quite memorable. 
What I also really liked was the great cinematography. A very underrated feature of the film. Amanda Seyfried was also not bad at all and finally escaped a little bit of her image. Surprised by Cedric the Entertainer in such a serious role and he pulled it off very well.

Answers: no and no. Yes, the movie was slow and quiet, but you could also describe it as brooding and meditative. The plot built slowly but steadily, and the storytelling approach was so sparse that you could hear the characters breathing and feel their anxieties. As a result, each character's progressions really worked. The blank spaces also left room for a spirituality that rarely takes place in American cinema. I went from wondering if I should stay to wanting to see it again. The last third of this film was absolutely transcendent, but not necessarily straightforward. And the questions about religion and power and justice were large, but the film avoided becoming a philosophical treatise. In short, this film's complex.

61,ronakkotian,A challenging and daring character study,9,7 November 2020,"Paul Schrader has given us amazing classics like Taxi Driver and Raging Bull but I never saw any of his directorial work. After watching First Reformed, I need to see what else he has made.First Reformed focuses on Reverend Toller whose life spirals out of control after meeting with an environmental activist.Like Taxi Driver, Paul Schrader once again delivers an unsettling character study of a person who slowly loses his mind and does so extremely well. It's been a while since I've seen this film but I haven't been able to let it go easily. I don't think a normal mainstream audience will like this film. It moves at a moderately slow pace and its themes challenge your mind. I love the overall presentation of this film. It's told in a very sombre and subdued manner which managed to effectively create a tense tone. The cinematography and camerawork is stunning. The camera tends to stay in a fixed position throughout most of the film and when it moves, it's very purposeful. The muted colours also created a dark and depressing atmosphere that felt very suitable for the film.Apart from looking gorgeous, Schrader's screenplay is truly brilliant. Filled with so many thought-provoking dialogues, Schrader's script is daring and explores the institution of religion, environmentalism, radical ideologies, hope and despair through Toller's perspective skilfully. As the film went on, I loved how Toller's mental and physical state deteriorated and how the intensity grew with it. The ending has received a lot of criticism and I wasn't completely on board with it at first but over time I grew to appreciate it. It's meant to be left up to interpretation and Schrader purposely leaves a few clues within the dialogue, editing and camerawork that help you come up with a judgement.This might just be Ethan Hawke's best performance. It's not a flashy performance by any means. It's far more restrained and Hawke does a superb job convincing you as this person. Amanda Seyfried also delivers a very good performance. I was quite surprised to see Cedric the Entertainer here since I mostly associate him with comedies but he also did a really good job.First Reformed is a very interesting character study that kept me thinking about what it was saying for quite some time. The acting is solid and Paul Schrader did a great job writing and directing. See this film if you ever get the chance.",First Reformed
62,andrewroy-04316,"A dark, intense slow burn with deep themes and great characters and acting",7,16 September 2018,"First Reformed, like Taxi Driver, is a gritty, dark film that focuses on a complex protagonist who tries to understand the world around them despite their troubled pasts and minds. First Reformed is a movie you have to go in with patience and expecting a dark, deep dive into religion and morality. Schrader plays with some excellent themes here, and in particular the struggle to reconcile the church's apathy towards environmental destruction. It is clear that there's a deeper parallel between Hawke's son's death and the responsibility he feels for that with the desire to right himself and Michael by fighting for environmental protection. Hawke truly brings out morality and thoughtfulness in a dark, struggling man. The cinematography is excellent and the script is good. I thought there were some scenes that didn't really add much to the story and could've given more substance to the characters around Hawke. There were certainly a few scenes that were shocking and riveting - in particular the scene with the barbed wire with the music playing in the background was felt viscerally. The ending wasn't super satisfying for me, and I'm not sure them kissing quite encapsulates the depth of each of their significant struggles internally and searches for positive meaning in life. There are some great scenes, and many phenomenal ideas and themes explored that make it a successful intellectual movie, but not quite enough substance, plot, and consistent propulsion for me to be constantly invested. A very worthwhile watch with lots of larger ideas and a wonderful performance from Hawke, but didn't quite get me invested throughout.",First Reformed

64,bgar-80932,Good but stumbles,7,6 April 2019,Great acting. Ethan Hawke is excellent as a reverend with a unfortunate past. You all saw it so I don't know why I started it as a synopsis. Anyways I think he really shines. I think the wife of the guy who blew his brains out didn't seem all that upset which threw me off but maybe it's because the fella had been acting not himself for a while thus it made it a little less emotional for her. Maybe she was in shock. When Ethan Hawke walked up on the body that legitimately shocked me. Somewhere in the middle I got a wee bit bored but you could tell he was slowly changing and becoming radical (before you see him with Michael's old suicide vest lol). It lost it's gravity a bit because I started caring less but I was still fairly invested but basically only in Reverend Hawke. I think I liked the first half up until an emotional moment then it dragged. It also didn't really have the ending I would have liked. I think Hawke made this a solid 7 but the direction and the payoff wasn't very good so it probably should have been lower.,First Reformed

66,jordan2240,So tired of movies with horrible endings,6,14 February 2019,"Came across this on 'Prime' (or was it Netflix) and thought it looked interesting, though I was reluctant to watch it because I'm not a huge fan of Amanda Seyfried. Took a chance anyway, and think her performance was excellent, as was everyone's. I thought the film raised some interesting questions with regard to trying to reconcile religion with the reality of what goes on in the world. And while I'm not a particularly religious person, I liked that it made no judgment on religion. Though it's not an action-packed thriller, I did find it kept me interested, and I never found it boring. And then there was the ending. For me, it basically ruined the entire film. I get why the pastor (he was not a priest) decided to not go through with his original plan, but I do not understand why he was even considering drinking drano (or the like) in the privacy of his own residence when it would have done nothing to convey his intended message. And I have absolutely no idea what the wrapping himself in barbed-wire meant. I thought he was going to go in front of the congregation that way to make his point (after nixing his original idea). I'm not even sure if he had it on under his robe when he and Seyfried met at the end (or perhaps like another reviewer surmised, he was merely fantasizing as he died). If he did, she apparently didn't feel it, which would have been highly unlikely.The notes on the film say Schrader wrote an ending where the pastor did go through with his original plan, which, while rather dark, would have been much more appropriate given his state of mind - though I would have had him blow only himself up rather than take any of the congregation with him, which I assume would have happened given the size of the explosives.",First Reformed
67,TheDonaldofDoom,Environmental collapse meets religious faith,7,24 January 2019,"The issue of how looming environmental apocalypse can be squared with faith in God is a scary one. It raises so many questions, most obviously why would God allow his creations to be destroyed? These difficult questions are tackled by ""First Reformed"" in thoughtful ways, even if it struggles to provide satisfying answers.It pokes at these questions through a reverend who is having his faith tested. An in-depth character study, the writing takes religious faith seriously and the performances are deep and insightful, giving a sense that the reverend is a real three-dimensional character. His responses to the environmental activist seem realistic, yet it's also clear that he isn't fully satisfied with them himself. After the activist leaves the reverend is left to ponder these issues and it's from there that his inner conflict spirals, and a wider range of issues is explored.Martyrdom, for instance. Specifically, relating to environmental activism. It's interesting to see this discussed seriously in a religious sense. What is the line between sacrifice and suicide? The reverend grapples with this in real ways that culminates in the climax with him donning a suicide vest. The activist killed himself, clearly suicide influenced by his own existential problems, yet this action spurred the reverend to make radical choices he otherwise wouldn't have made. It's this effect, in my opinion, that he wants to replicate in what can seem like a moment of madness. Also something that struck me is the links between the Church and a corporation that is literally destroying life now and in the future. These links make it even harder for the reverend to bring up environmental issues.The film moves along at a restrained pace, sometimes too restrained for me. There is a need to be contemplative when directing a film like this but the ideas weren't so complicated that they needed to be that slowly. Despite the film's existentialism, its themes are laid out in a fairly straightforward way, so it does feel like the running time could have been cut, at least a little.The one exception to the grounded realism comes when the reverend and the activist's wife escape the world for a moment and fly above landscapes beautiful and damaged by human activity. This is the one part of the film whose full meaning eluded me, but it was a welcome break from what is otherwise a very sombre film.The ending is a bit of a cop-out. The crisis of faith builds up to the point where you're wondering how it could possibly be tied up in a satisfying way. The answer that ""First Reformed"" provides is too easy and too generic. The reverend finds comfort in love, in another human. It's a disappointing ending, one that is appealing on the surface but is generic enough that it could be the ending to any ""crisis of faith"" film and doesn't get at the root of the themes explored. I'd have preferred an ambiguous ending that admitted there is no easy answer, than one long kiss to save the day.",First Reformed

There were two questionable moments-that trip through nature, and the final exchange (both a happy and a sad ending could've been powerful, but this was just cliche)-but they're outweighed by the loaded theological pondering, the hopeless expose of environmental destruction and religious evils (see the contrast of the celebration plans with everything else), and the resulting descent into despair and anger that envelops the viewer.

It tells the story of the minister at First Reformed, who is going through a spiritual crisis exacerbated by one of his parishioners' suicide.Pastor Ernst Toller (Ethan Hawke) is a 46-year-old minister in spiritual crisis. He had been an army chaplain in a generations-old military family. He encouraged his son to join the army against the objections of his wife. Unfortunately, the son died in Iraq within six months, devastating Toller and ending his marriage. Pastor Joel Jeffers (Cedric Kyles) of the Abundant Life 5000-seat mega-church offers him a position at historic First Reformed, about to celebrate its 250th anniversary.Toller's Sunday morning service attracts less than 20 people but includes Mary Mensana (Amanda Seyfried) and her husband, Michael (Philip Ettinger). Michael is an environmental activist in extreme depression who wants his wife to end her pregnancy. Mary asks Toller to counsel him, which he does. The irony is that Toller's anguish is as deep as Michael's. Nonetheless, Toller says that one needs to hold together two contradictory truths--hope and despair.After Michael's suicide, Pastor Toller pays increasing attention to Mary, to the dismay of Esther (Victoria Hill), a musical staff member at Abundant Life who is in love with Toller. Toller also is aware he is probably suffering from a serious illness, though he has ignored the symptoms for months. And his own commitment to the climate crisis increases as his disdain for a major corporate polluter at Abundant Life is paying the bills for First Reform's major anniversary celebration.This is quite a remarkable movie based in religion.

It isn't that 1976 movie that Paul Schrader had a hand in, but is instead a portrayal of a minister of a ""museum church"" supported by a megachurch and a polluting corporation. The film begins with an unsettling suicide, and this leads to the lead character, the minister played by Ethan Hawke, to question things.This is not light viewing. The movie succeeds on its intense brooding and on its examination of its lead characters. Mr. Hawke and his fellow cast members deliver a great performance.

74,jb_campo,So Close to being a Great Film,6,23 February 2019,"First Reformed is a 250-year old church in upstate NY run by Pastor Toller (Ethan Hawke). The parish has very few members. Most people go to this nearby, trendy, modern Abundant Life church, with huge spaces and superb facilities. The Pastor there, Cedric the entertainer, keeps looking in on Toller because he's concerned about his health and his state of mind.Toller is keeping a daily journal of all his thoughts for a year. This was an excellent medium to expose this thoughts with little camera action. You discover that he has a somewhat mysterious past, where something happened, but you're not sure what or how serious it was.Enter Mary (Amanda Seyfried) as one of his parishoners, who asks Toller to speak to her husband who returned from the war. As Toller interacts with Mary's husband Michael, he becomes moved by the environmental cause that drives Michael.That's when the story takes off, leading Pastor Toller thru and excruciating decision-making thought process that brings him great pain in many ways.
Things happen, and you get to the 250th celebration, and the movie ends abruptly.Let's start with the acting. It was absolutely outstanding. What a performance by both Hawke and Seyfried. The emotion, yet calmness, they both displayed keeps you riveted throughout. I loved the interactions too between Hawke and Cedric. Cedric has pretty much bought into the system in more ways than one you suspect. Something is helping his big church stay big and nice and updated. A fringe but important role is the catalyst Balq, a big multinational company that produces something that is apparently not good for the environment. Michael Gaston is the no-nonsense Balq, and he delivers a solid performance too.The cinematography is simple yet effective. Excellent pan shots inside the church make you feel like you are there. There's a fantastic scene in the woods where you see just what Toller sees, when he sees it, and that helps the suspense.The story has real potential, and for the most part, it delivers. But the Director, well, I've read that he does these kinds of endings. So when the movie ends, you sit there saying, what? Reminded me of the movie Enemy, with Jake Gyllenhaal. For me, the ending was terrible. Also, the build up to the ending leaves you shaking your head too. the ending is supposed to tie up the movie, but this ending disassociated the reality you drew from most of the movie with the decisions being made by Hawke.The ending, in this case, ruined what could have been a great movie of 8/10. Still, I recommend this movie because of the story plot, and because the acting was terrific. First Reformed missed it by that much.

75,WalkdenEntertainment,A Reverend With Worldly Concerns On His Mind...,8,10 January 2019,"Reverend Toller (Ethan Hawke) looks after and manages a historic church known as the First Reformed. There he preaches and serves a small congregation. Toller also conducts regular tours for those who visit as well as general maintenance around the church property, keeping the old building up to scratch. The town's churches are about to celebrate First Reformed's 250th Anniversary which will involve other churches and community members. While preparing for this main event, Rev Toller agrees to meet with a man who is struggling with life and the current status of the world that surrounds him.After a couple of meetings and seeing Toller trying to help this man with his wisdom and Godly guidance, things surrounding Rev Toller's mind and his thoughts become dark. Reverend Toller also begins to wrestle with himself and the stress he carries daily.First Reformed does something very well which I haven't seen much of in 2018 and that is the pacing. This film's pacing only seems to add more and more tension, building towards the film's final and last act. The film can be rather dark and tense, both because of Rev Toller and the world surrounding him. As a character, I also enjoyed how Rev Toller daily wrote in a journal, keeping no secret thoughts from the audience. This also leads me to my next positive point.Ethan Hawke has delivered an outstanding performance and I absolutely love his work here. It's obvious that the actor has even considered some of the most minor details which make truly makes the audience forget who are watching.Another positive choice to speak about is the director's creative choice of using a 4:3 aspect ratio (Box screen size instead of normal 16:9 widescreen ratio) for the film's entire duration. I also loved enjoyed little details like the classic way of doing the film's introduction credits. The aspect ratio and the credits of the opening are just some of the minor details that also make the film feel slightly uncomfortable and makes the audience feel a little trapped. Regardless of your thoughts on these minor elements, they do help the film's dark tone, rather than simply trying to give thrills to the audience.Overall, while I enjoyed First Reformed's style, story and performances by Ethan Hawke, the film is an incredibly dark tale which will stay with audience after viewing and perhaps even leave you questioning elements, including the film's endings. It's great to see a good suspenseful and gritty film, using basic film techniques with solid acting rather just making a modern noisy film with a green screen and boo scares. True credit also goes out to the director (Paul Schrader) and his creative work here. I feel this film will have different meanings and overall effect on its audiences (including myself).8.6/10

76,darkreignn,"An incredible story of grief, love, and redemption - an analysis",10,30 October 2018,"""First Reformed"" completely threw me for a loop. I bought this film solely because Ethan Hawke is one of my favorite actors, and I knew the movie got good reviews; besides that, I knew nothing of the film other than Ethan Hawke played a priest. So when the film started, I was intrigued and compelled by the stellar performances of Hawke and Amanda Seyfried, and I was eager to see more. Then, at one point, I thought the film was turning into an incredibly heavy-handed political commentary, and to be honest with you, this started to turn me off from the film because of how blatant it was. And then, things started, or at least I started thinking, that things were getting very ridiculous to an absurd degree. And then the ending happened and it completely changed my entire opinion about this film. Seriously, the ending was one of the most beautiful pieces of filmmaking I have ever seen - it destroyed my predictions and expectations of what the final few minutes of the film would be like. In fact, I loved it so much that after the film was over, with my newfound knowledge of the ending fresh in my mind, I immediately restarted the movie and watched it over again from beginning to end.""First Reformed"" is a film about a man's spiral into hopelessness and depression, and ultimately, redemption. Right off the bat, I can tell you that this movie is not for everyone. It is very bleak and slow moving, perhaps can be seen as a commentary on global warming (though I would beg to differ, and I will explain why soon), and it goes to some very dark places. But in my opinion, the core of this movie deals with self-hatred, and Ethan Hawke's struggle to set aside this hatred and instead embrace love, both his own, and the love of others.Ethan Hawke and Amanda Seyfried give powerhouse performances that are truly worth of not only Oscar nominations, but wins. Ethan Hawke portrays a man haunted by his past, and even though that sounds as cliché as anything you've ever heard of before, trust me when I tell you that once you find out exactly why his character is the way he is, you'll completely understand why this movie goes in the direction that it does. You see, at first glance, the movie really does seem like the director's attempt to inform the audience of the dangers of global warming. But if you actually watch the entire film and pay attention to the characterization within it, you'll quickly understand that that isn't what the director was intending.Ethan Hawke plays a character who wants to die. He drinks a handle of whiskey every night. He is in excruciating pain and pees blood, but avoids going to the doctor to see what's wrong. He has a girl who is clearly in love with him, but he doesn't pursue her, and instead even goes as far as to yell at her and leave her crying in a state of shock. And with this, there is noticeable tension between Ethan Hawke and Amanda Seyfried, tension of the sexual kind. It's obvious that they are attracted to each other, and yet neither of them ever attempt to act upon this attraction. Instead, Ethan Hawke continues to self-destruct. So when he starts to get absorbed in global warming to a dangerous, fanatical degree, it can be seen as almost senseless. Why is this happening? Isn't this against his character? And as you watch him spiral even further into this insane fanaticism, even going as far as to potentially turn into a suicide bomber, you'll find yourself wondering, ""Did this film go off the deep end?"" I'm here to tell you it didn't.All of this is compatible with Ethan's character. He is so grief stricken and so depressed, he wants to die so badly, but he can never find himself to go through with it. So he latches on to this idea of fanatical global warming terrorism because it is finally an excuse for him to die. He doesn't really care about the environment. He isn't really passionate about global warming. He simply wants to die, and this is the excuse he latches on to in order to finally give himself a reason to die; when you see him strap on that suicide vest and then scream in agony when he realizes he can't go through with it, you're seeing a man's only perceived refuge crumble in front of his eyes.That is as far as I will delve into the plot, because I really think that this movie is an incredible story that should be experienced by anyone with the stomach to witness it. ""First Reformed"" is a film I haven't been able to stop thinking about, and I hope that you watch it, analyze it, and love it as much as I do.10/10",First Reformed

A. That I with body and soul, both in life and death, am not my own, but belong unto my faithful Savior Jesus Christ. (Heidelberg Catechism)For countless Catholics of a certain age, whether practicing or lapsed, the first question and answer above, instilled in them in CCD classes or parochial school, are as much a part of them as their own names, or more so. For Paul Schrader, , the second question and answer have similarly deep roots.First Reformed is not the first Schrader film to quote these opening lines of the Calvinist Heidelberg Catechism. They also appear in his 1979 film Hardcore, which is largely set in Los Angeles, but is 100% about the Dutch Reformed mecca of Grand Rapids, Michigan, where Schrader grew up.In Hardcore, George C. Scott tried to explain the TULIP acrostic for Calvinism's ""Five Points"" to an amiably baffled sex worker. Forty years on, First Reformed finds its protagonist, Ethan Hawke's Rev. Toller, facing a world in which his theological tradition seems if anything even more incomprehensible. The words of the catechesis of his youth will always be with Toller, as with Schrader, but what comfort or assurance do such words offer today?Toller's post - a small Dutch Colonial clapboard church in upper New York state, built by 18th-century Dutch emigrants - is significant historically, but scarcely in any other way. Toller guides more tourists on weekdays than congregants Sunday morning, explaining the church's ties to the Underground Railroad, pointing out historic graves in the church cemetery, and selling souvenirs in the gift shop.Ethan Hawke cuts a looming, flinty-eyed and tormented figure as a disillusioned and possibly unstable upstate New York Reverend, in Paul Schrader's austere but ultimately mesmerising character study. First Reformed, which refers to the name of a church in the film whilst obviously also lending itself to other interpretations, doesn't attempt to hide its debt to Schrader's acclaimed screenplays including Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. Beyond being another study of another of 'God's lonely men', of the narcissism of those who feel they are the only ones who can sense and purge the sickness running amok in the world, this film even mimics certain shots from Taxi Driver in ways anyone beyond vaguely familiar with that Scorsese/DeNiro milestone will recognise right away. Thanks to Hawke's commanding soul-in-torment performance, striking cinematography and production design, and a different setting, which allows for connections to more modern concerns about radicalisation, First Reformed ends up being a satisfying meditative echo if nothing more than a simple replay of Schrader greats.",First Reformed

80,danybur,A painful and surprising Christian parable,9,5 April 2021,"SummaryFirst Reformed is a remarkable film, a painful Christian parable that has the virtue of posing religiosity and pastoral mission as an existential problem rather than a mystical one, as a commitment that can take unexpected paths. And it does so from the hand of Reverend Toller, a concentrated character and quiet pain, in charge of Ethan Hawke in an exceptional performance.ReviewReverend Toller (Ethan Hawke) arrives in Upstate New York to take over the former Calvinist First Reformed Protestant Church, which is run by the modern Christian Abundant Life Center, which in turn intends to re-consecrate it. . Toller's encounter with Michael, an ecological activist (Philip Ettinger), and his wife Mary (Amanda Seyfried) will lead the priest to serious rethinks about his pastoral mission.That meeting of Toller (who comes to church carrying a history of loss and illness) with that marriage (being Michael, a deeply skeptical activist) triggers the reverend and the film's journey through a number of situations that have to do with the religiosity and its exercise, with the contrast between his church and the management model of Abundant Life and on a path of revelation for Toller, a concentrated and in pain.Paul Schrader's film, although very American in part of its theme, has a style very close to European cinema, with several fixed shots and a calm but never still rhythm regarding the future of its protagonist. Ethan Hawke, with his Reverend Toller, gives us an extraordinary, sober and painful performance, backed up by a remarkable Amanda Seyfried.This film has the rare virtue of treating the religiosity and the religious parable of its protagonist in an existential rather than mystical way, in a way that can move a non-religious viewer, breaking down their resistance, with a transcendence reminiscent of that of the films by Bruno Dumont and crowned by an absolutely epiphanic ending.",First Reformed

82,Bertaut,"Brilliantly shot, excellently written",7,24 July 2018,"Most reviews I've seen of First Reformed have praised it as Paul Schrader's best work since either Taxi Driver (1976) or Raging Bull (1980). And whilst I think that's an oversimplification, unjustly ignoring such strong screenplays as The Last Temptation of Christ (1988) and Bringing Out the Dead (1999), and very unjustly ignoring such superb directorial work as Affliction (1997) and Auto Focus (2002), there can be little doubt that First Reformed is easily his best film of the last fifteen years or so (which wouldn't be hard when you consider films like The Canyons (2013), Dying of the Light (2014), and Dog Eat Dog (2016)).The film tells a deceptively simple story - Reverend Ernst Toller (Ethan Hawke) is the parish priest of a small congregation in the Snowbridge suburb of New York. A former military chaplain, Toller is struggling with the death of his son, Joseph, who he encouraged to enlist, and who was killed several months into his first tour in Iraq. As a result, Toller's marriage fell apart, which his wife blaming him for Joseph's death. As the film begins, Toller's spiritual crisis is already well under way. He's drinking too much, doesn't show much interest in his official duties, doesn't seem bothered that his congregation has dwindled to about ten people, and has taken to recording his thoughts in a journal which he plans to keep for one year, and then destroy. After Sunday mass, Toller is approached by Mary (Amanda Seyfried), one of his parishioners, who is worried about her husband, Michael (Philip Ettinger). A radical environmentalist who has just been released from prison in Canada, Michael has developed extreme nihilistic views, and wants Mary to abort their unborn child because he doesn't think anyone has the right to bring a child into a dying world. Although initially reluctant to get involved, Mary persuades Toller to counsel Michael. Meanwhile, the 250th anniversary of the First Reformed church from which Toller works is fast approaching, with a huge service to be attended by both the governor and mayor.The above plot summary takes up roughly the first twenty minutes or so of the film, almost up to the end of the first act. At that point, it looks as if the narrative is heading in the direction of following Toller as he sets about changing Michael's extreme worldview. But that's not where it goes at all, instead focusing almost exclusively on the disintegration of Toller's faith, and the development of his own nihilistic outlook. Along the way, it introduces us to three main supporting characters - Reverend Joel Jeffers (Cedric the Entertainer) of Abundant Life, the megachurch that owns First Reformed, and who gave Toller his job; Esther (Victoria Hill), choirmaster at First Reformed, who had a brief sexual relationship with Toller after his marriage ended; and Edward Balq (Michael Gaston), an industrialist whose company is regarded as one of the worst polluters on the planet. As Toller wrestles with his conscience, he comes into conflict with all three in various ways. At the same time, Mary remains virtually the only remnant of hope in his life, as they continue to grow close.The most striking thing to me about First Reformed is that it is brilliantly shot in Academy ratio (1.37:1), and as a result, everything is boxed in, suggesting little room for movement, with very little empty space in the frame. Coupled with this, Schrader is remarkably consistent in composing perfectly symmetrical shots (the opening scene is a good example). Together, the small frame and the symmetrical compositions give one the impression of looking at a confessional, with the priest on one side and the confessor on the other. As Toller's journal entries occur throughout the film in the form of voiceover, this aesthetic replication of a confessional is enhanced even further - although Toller is not the priest hearing the confession, he is the one confessing.In line with this, First Reformed is not an easy film to watch. It's central themes are suffering, loss of faith, nihilism, and environmental catastrophe, and the way the film is shot, with the added intimacy of the journal, make it seems as if the audience is suffering right alongside Toller; we're drawn completely into his world, and even his mind, in a way very few films achieve. Schrader allows the content to brilliantly dictate the form, with the two becoming so intertwined as to be virtually indistinguishable from one another - a concept most filmmakers don't seem to even understand, let alone have the ability to accomplish. Interestingly this is the second film in the last twelve months to use Academy ratio for explicit narrative reasons, the other being David Lowery's superb A Ghost Story (2017).Of course, Schrader is as cine-literate as they come, and doesn't make films in isolation (for example, there are at least three explicit visual references to Taxi Driver), and looking at First Reformed in relation to his career would require a full article-length study to itself. However, the film in his oeuvre of which I was most reminded was, strangely enough, Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist (2005), which is not especially good, but which does share many of the same narrative beats and thematic concerns - a lost priest whose experiences of the darker side of humanity has led to him questioning his faith; a crisis of conscience; a righteous cause to which he totally gives himself over; an indifferent God watching everything unfold; an unimaginable sacrifice; hope offered in the form of an innocent. First Reformed is a lot better, and a lot more morally complex, but there's certainly a thematic consistency.However, that is not to say First Reformed is perfect. There are parts where it is extraordinarily clunky. For example, there's the wake where a group of environmentalists start singing an awful cappella version of Neil Young's activist song, ""Who's Gonna Stand up?"", or the scene where Mary and Toller take (figurative) flight through the power of holding hands (in a scene that reminded me of The Big Lebowski (1998) far more than I would imagine was intended, and got quite a few laughs at the screening I attended).Additionally, although I've seen many reviews talking about how thought-provoking the environmentalist side of the story is, for me it never really coalesced into anything inherently coherent. Obviously, Toller is a man ready to fall apart when the movie begins, and Michael's concerns about the future of the planet serve as the catalyst for that. However, rather than the film presenting this as nothing more than the backdrop against which Toller's crisis takes place, and thus purposely rendering it unimportant in and of itself, Schrader seems to be trying to genuinely shoehorn in a call-to-action. Which is fairly out of place. And, to be honest, the photograph of the emaciated polar bear is far more disturbing and resonant than any of the facts and figures the film occasionally tosses out.I'm also not 100% convinced the black comedy worked. There aren't that many instances of it, but when they come, they are so black as to be easily missed. Probably the best example is when Toller is showing a group of children around First Reformed, and telling them how it was a stop on the Underground Railroad, showing them a secret basement in which the runaway slaves would hide. However, instead of simply giving them a quick history lesson, he ends up staring into the basement and giving a graphic description of what it must have been like hiding in the dark, scared and tired, with no room to move. There's a few moments like this, but I didn't think they really sat well with the ultra-realism on display elsewhere.But they're minor faults, and all things considered, this is a high-quality film. Will it be in contention come awards season? Possibly. Schrader has always had a fraught relationship with the Academy (hard to believe he's never even been nominated for an Oscar), but this is the kind of serious subject matter that voters usually lap up. I certainly wouldn't be surprised to see Hawke get some acting nods, possibly Seyfried too. Irrespective of that (and we all know the amount of Oscar nominations a film gets has very little to do with its quality), this is a strong film made by a skilled artist about a subject matter for which he clearly feels deeply.",First Reformed

What a concept. That priests are human too. I hear enough pessimistic, terrible things in my own life, so I didn't like the movie, also the husband is just a loser who thinks that just because he's human that it makes him a world citizen and that he should be scared of everything around the entire world instead of what is going in right now in his own life.",First Reformed
84,peeedeee-94281,I enjoyed this film...when it was called 'Taxi Driver',1,4 July 2018,"I knew I was in for an unconventional film when it turned out to be filmed in full frame, not widescreen. Made-for-TV? I didn't understand the choice of aspect ratio. Then there was the lack of incidental music. Sometimes that works, and sometimes it doesn't, and for this movie, it was the latter. It just made the long dialogue scenes more dull. And what was with keeping in the flubbed lines and using master shots for many scenes early in the movie. The movie only starts to pick up when the Amanda Seyfried's character finds something that becomes a plot point later in the film.
Now for the 'taxi driver' aspects. Way too many similarities to make it just a coincidence. First you have an isolated, unsociable misfit character in the form of Ethan Hawke's priest. He has a poor diet, just like Travis Bickle (alcohol in his cereal bowl too!). He had stomach pains just like Bickle. He wrote in a daily journal, just like Bickle. He became obsessed with a mission after being 'turned on' out of his complacency, just like Bickle. In Bickle's case, he first wanted to hurt Cybil Sheppard's 'boss', then it was Jodie Foster's 'boss'. In this movie, it's the 'boss' of the big company donating to the churches.
I'm not sure if Schrader was trying to say anything about environmentalism in this movie. It was a bit convoluted. And the floating scene was just bizarre, as was the ending (which I assume was some kind of 'dream'). 
Overall, a big disappointment based on all the glowing reviews and high IMDB rating. A real snoozer that should have been called Taxi Driver Priest.",First Reformed
85,Jared_Andrews,Grim Portrait of a Man in Crisis,7,6 July 2018,"Some objectively good movies also make you feel good while watching them. Others crush you with weighty material, penetrating emotions and powerhouse performances. 'First Reformed' falls into the second category. Legendary writer-director Paul Schrader returns to his past glorious form with this film. Some 40 years after writing 'Taxi Driver', he unleashes another portrait of a man experiencing a deep existential crisis as he sinks further into despair because of what he perceives to be a failing humanity. Our new Travis Bickle is Reverend Ernst Toller (Ethan Hawke, in an Oscar-worthy performance). Toller runs a small church in New York state called First Reformed, which has a dwindling congregation of merely a dozen. Nearby, First Reformed's parent church, which has a following of thousands, is headed by Reverend Jeffers (Cedric the Entertainer). Toller and Jeffers clash over their ways to best perform the Lord's work. Toller rejects all physical possessions and scoffs at the financial success of the parent church, while Jeffers futilely attempts to convince Toller that wealth and religious commitment are not mutually exclusive. Toller is not a well man. He struggles to take joy in any aspect of life. His past haunts him, as do the present failures of humanity. His despair becomes increasingly clear with each passing day that he writes in his diary, which was intended to be a form of prayer and offer clarity but instead only serves as a vehicle for him to psychologically self-punish. As his mental health suffers, so does his physical state. He's sick, probably dying, but he guzzles hard liquor daily despite the stomach pain it causes. Perhaps this too is self-punishment. As Toller struggles to find a purpose for his remaining time on Earth, one appears before him when a pregnant parishioner, Mary (a career-best Amanda Seyfried), asks him to counsel her suicidal husband. Toller agrees, but the conversations don't lead to any relief for either party. Toller believes he finds a purpose, but anyone of sound mind would hardly consider it a Godly cause. This all builds to a climactic scene that will leave some viewers in breathless awe and others in maddening disbelief. I took the final moments as a welcome relief after a punishing first 105 minutes, but some may see the abrupt pivot in tone as off putting. In any case, it's certainly spiritual trip and one that will stick with you long after the credits roll.",First Reformed
86,cgearheart,A deeply moving film; the best I've seen this year,10,27 June 2018,"First Reformed is not only a surprising comeback for writer/director Paul Schrader, but it is truly the best film I've seen all year. Quietly intense, disturbingly real, and hauntingly human. First Reformed tastefully covers a parade of controversial topics, especially with handling the concept of Christianity. The movie is neither preachy or anti-religion in its approach, but rather shows religion for what it is: a reasonable release for sadness and guilt, but also a burden. On top of that, the film struck me and frightened with it's realistic approach of a world at environmental collapse. The film then covers another variety of very heavy topics such as family death, abortion, alcoholism, suicide, adultery, and many others. 
I won't speak anything else about it because First Reformed is truly a film you have to see for yourself to believe.",First Reformed
87,scb_coldsteel,Not for everyone but I loved it!,9,1 October 2018,"So I just saw First Reformed at the theater. I absolutely loved it! I was really looking forward to this as I'm a huge fan of the director/writer. For those of you who are unaware Paul Schrader is the legendary screenwriter behind Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Last Temptation Of Christ, and Affliction. He is an immensely talented screenwriter who has combined a number of his trademark themes together to craft his magnum opus First Reformed.With First Reformed Paul Schrader has meticulously crafted a cinematic philosophical meditation on the nature of spirituality, nihilism, alienation, and dread. I felt like I should have been watching the movie with a notebook so I could take notes.The central plot of the movie involves a depressed and alcoholic priest and his slow descent into despair over the mass ecological harm humans have done to the Earth. The central theme of the movie asks can God forgive us for what we have done to his creation, both the earth and to ourself.Similar to Taxi Driver the movie deals heavily with how society can leave us alienated and depressed, feeling like we can't effect change. It asks tough dark questions like would we really want to bring a child up in a world that we have destroyed?The movie covers a wide variety of social topics ranging from politics, religion, community, environmentalism, and growing up in a ever-changing world. The movie is so rich with ideas, it demands to be watched multiple times.Acting wise I was immensely impressed. I am a fan of Ethan Hawke anyway, but this may be his best performance. He perfectly presented such a wide range of emotions in a believable manner. You really felt for his character and his sense of loss as his emotional state deteriorated. In a character driven, dialogue-heavy movie acting can make or break a film. Ethan Hawks role definitely elevated this film to another level.On top of that the cinematography was excellent. The film was shot in an older, more gritty style that paid emphasis to the actors on screen. With most movies nowadays emphasizing style over substance, it was refreshing to see a movie based entirely around substance.I loved the film, but this movie will not be for everyone. It has a slower pace and does run a bit long. The movie is completely dialogue based, you have to really pay attention to what is being said. It also has a few ambiguous parts in the movie that challenge the viewer.I understand that not everyone wants to go to a movies and be philosophical lectured to about the environment and spirituality, but for me the movie struck all the right chords. You cannot be a passive viewer for this film. If requires patience and dedication, but it will leave you thinking. A 8.75 out of 10.",First Reformed
88,Bento_de_Espinosa,Why is a superstar like Ethan Hawke in this?,1,5 October 2018,"I have no idea why Ethan Hawke accepted to play in this movie. Maybe because he is a friend of its director? The reason I am saying this is because this movie is very amateurishly made. Camera, lighting, direction. It is dark, dull and depressing. And then the story: it just does not know where it wants to go. What is this movie really about? We do not know even how Hawke's character was able to become a priest, since he evidently has no talent. The worst part: the ending. Predictable and laughable.",First Reformed
89,tkaine3,Terribly wasted trip that goes nowhere...,3,5 August 2018,"For someone to say Ethan Hawke was born for this role must of lived a pretty morbid life. Yes I'm a fan of Ethan but this film will not be on his list of good films because this movie by no accounts was good.. The pace was horrible. Slow and sluggish. It takes 40 mins. for something to appear and once it does you can end it there nothing else happens.The acting was on par but I didn't see any on screen charisma the characters didn't seem like they meshed well. It could also be the dialogue because when characters star doing things out of character or changing their routines erratically it's hard to relate at all to what your watching. There isn't really much to talk about either with this film the cinematography was avg.
Music was a few old hyms and a song written by a conspiracy theorist. There was one scene for special effects and the storyline seemed like it could of went somewhere but the writing was futile and had too many holes. 
The ending reaffirms my conclusion that this film lacked any mojo, for one whole minute they make you witness the most awkward kiss on screen at the end. All in all I give this a terrible time wasted rating at 3 for 'First Reformed' Ethan can't save this flick don't waste your time attending this funeral.",First Reformed
90,PotassiumMan,"Religious drama starts out solid, then becomes infuriatingly ludicrous",5,3 June 2018,"It is very unusual for a film to aggravate me with its heavy-handed narrative and simple-minded mentality, but this one enraged me more than any other film I've seen in years. To be sure, this film does not immediately embrace its radical ideology. It starts out deliberately, almost at a molasses-like pace but then abruptly turns into something profoundly and alarmingly nonsensical, which is why I'm never going to forget it, but not in a good way.Director Paul Schrader provides us with the story of Reverend Toller (played with pained dignity by Ethan Hawke), who lost his son in Iraq and has had to cope with the emotional scars ever since. His marriage is in ruins. His stately old church in upstate New York is an historical landmark but lives in the shadows of the more modern, larger congregation that has greater weight in the local community. Hawke's character gets to know a young couple in his small church, one of whom is a troubled environmental activist.This raw drama is meant to be about the loss of faith, but its singular problem is the dearth of character development that is required for the extreme turn that the plot takes. The film's descent into lunacy, into over-the-top absurdity is not warranted given how little we connect with Hawke's character. His life has problems, for sure, but his psyche is somewhat inscrutable (despite a voiceover diary, no less) and therefore what follows is inexplicable. His ultimate motives are maddeningly opaque. The ideological transformation lacks a coherent basis and therefore never touches credibility even with its fingertips. The film's shift felt very sudden, and I was shaking my head in the end, wondering how the storyline, for lack of a better word, collapsed. Its promising start felt like years ago when the credits were rolling.With the right approach and a more subtle, nuanced point of view, this film could have been a classic. Instead, it becomes a cartoonish propaganda piece that will not satisfy an educated audience. Not recommended.",First Reformed
91,bastille-852-731547,"Thought-Provoking, Unsettling Character Study",8,6 October 2017,"Paul Schrader's new drama ""First Reformed"" is a drama about a grieving reverend who is counseling a couple--the husband of which is a radical environmentalist. This is a talky, dialogue- driven, and unsettling thriller that makes you both empathize with its characters as well as send a chill down your spine at times.The film's deeply intellectual and serious commentary on matters of religion and environmentalism is profound and thoughtful. This movie will likely not be suited for mainstream audiences desiring cheap entertainment, but serious viewers looking to be challenged in their thought processes will have much material to ponder during--and after--they view the movie. The acting is very strong, as Schrader commands his cast into giving low-key but quietly powerful and resonant performances. The standouts in the cast are Ethan Hawke's lead role as well as Amanda Seyfried and Cedric the Entertainer in the supporting cast. A gripping, dark (almost relentlessly so at times) tone keeps the viewer engrossed in the film. While this isn't a horror film (despite containing disturbing content and moments,) the film's simple score is incredibly chilling and gets under one's skin more than almost any other film's score I have witnessed in a long time.My only complaints about this film are found in the third act. A dreamlike, surrealistic scene inspired by impressionism that involves the protagonist and Seyfried's character feels out of place given the grim tone deeply rooted in realism. Additionally, a quick and highly abrupt cut in the film's finale feels disappointing and almost like the equivalent of a 'cop-out' in film editing. It did not positively impact how I viewed the film's ending. But other than these concerns, this is a very well-made and serious drama designed to quietly shock audiences into a state of reflection on the world today as we know it. 8/10",First Reformed

The familiar path of the American independent film is taken, as quite lives are rolled out until they break.As strong as this piece is, and Mr Hawke is absolutely excellent, the elements of the film don't all land together perfectly so by the end we are not 100% convinced. The back story, the health issues, the environmentalism, the radicalism, the depression; the Calvinism; it needed a better touch to keep a balance than Paul Schrader managed.

97,Ziglet_mir,Holding Contradicting Thoughts Simultaneously,10,12 October 2019,"I have nothing but the highest praise for Schrader, who is the mastermind behind this project, conducting wonderful performances from the entire gallery-particularly Hawke as Reverend Toller and Seyfried as Mary. Ettinger as Michael is a scene stealer, providing just a big enough spark to trigger Toller's decent into madness. From a production standpoint, this film nails everything.There is a lot to be said of this film regarding the era it was made, as society has grown more and more secular throughout the years. Schrader pits faith against environmentalism, as we also see them align more broadly with Hope & Despair. This film holds quite the statement during a time when the topics it covers are highly polarized, and many folks condemn others who don't think the way they do. But the proper takeaway and the ultimate message Schrader is telling us (as Toller to a despairing Michael does) is, ""Courage is the solution to despair, reason provides no answers. I can't know what the future will bring; we have to choose despite uncertainty. Wisdom is holding two contradictory truths in our mind, simultaneously, Hope and despair. A life without despair is a life without hope."" Which is a beautiful message we very rarely receive through a film as realistic as First Reformed.The issues I think most folks have with faith is the stigma that you can't hold faith while also understanding science. Which is emphatically untrue. There are certainly smart and rational ways to handle one's faith while also tackling materialistic avenues of science. And in a strange way (referencing the era), Environmentalism has become a religion all of its own. Take it from Michael during his talk with Toller-clearly having contemplating the logic of bringing a child into a world he thinks is falling apart. Does one belief override the other? Is it being selfish to want to have a child with the world supposedly in the terrible state it is in? Will God forgive us?But even as important as these topics are, and as eloquently as Schrader introduces us to these themes, he is merely just using environmentalism as a catalyst for our main character's ultimate redemption in faith. Before Toller ever meets Michael, he shows no interest in the environment in particular, and when the two finally sit to talk we learn the gravity of Toller's life struggle, which is as hard-hitting as it can be for a man of apparent moral guilt. And Toller brilliantly answers Michael with, ""Now Michael, I can promise you that whatever despair you feel about bringing a child into this world cannot equal the despair of taking a child from it.""From the catalyst of their talk Toller begins to realize he has found something he may be able to attribute to his long lost search to end his own life. He struggles with this resolution as he continues to help lonely Mary with her problems. And through her does Toller ultimately find his reasoning to live again. Two absolutely stunning scenes- one of naturalistic mysticism and the other of magical realism perhaps, changes Toller. The first undoubtedly throws a wrench into his plans of dying, while the second is the culmination of his redemptive journey.The last 5 min does not end at all the way you think it will and is all the better for it. A brilliantly written alternative that shakes off any contrived tropes we get in many a film today.",First Reformed
98,svhot,"Wow, ""First Reformed"" is a dark thriller hidden in the format of a faith-based movie",8,19 December 2018,"""First Reformed"" attempts to tackle some very real, controversial, and genuine issues that majority of the people on earth seem to ignore - instead of finding positive solutions to these problems. In this movie, Ethan Hawke plays a reverend who is constantly ( but secretly) grieving the loss of his son, whom he encouraged to join the army / military.While working as a reverend at the First Reformed Church, he meets a girl (Amanda Seyfried), whose boyfriend has become a radical environmentalist. Ethan Hawke is invited to their house to counsel her boyfriend. When Hawke talks to him, they discuss and debate on issues such as hope and despair, environmental problems and how people and powerful organizations continue to ignore them, and the fact that Amanda's on-screen boyfriend does not want to bring a child into this world.

99,rabbitmoon,"I was grateful for a decent film, but Schrader loses his grip",7,20 July 2018,"At first I felt like I could be watching a PT Anderson film, from the 4:3 ratio, the opening credits, the measured writing and direction of the opening scenes. It was interesting, compelling, and refreshingly 'of quality' compared to most modern films. Heck, just being an original script is something to commend these days. Soon though, it feels like it starts to come apart at the seams. Ethan Hawke starts to feel too much like Ethan Hawke - always an actor acting, rather than a fully realised character of depth (which this role really requires - Philip Seymour Hoffman would have nailed it so much better were he still around). Scenes start to drag out without a real sense of purpose, as though Schrader is biding his time for some later pay-off. Little moments of tension or conflict are snuffed out as soon as they begin. The whole story and character trajectory starts to resemble Ethan Hawke/Andrew Niccol's terrible movie 'Good Kill', and you half expect him to start punching mirrors. The religious aspects are played out with a bizarre, passionless sterility that's so contrived and indicative of Schrader's seething resentment for it, which undermines the character we're supposed to be interested in. The 'evil corporation' stuff feels like it could have developed more rewardingly in another film, but here is a bit of a red herring. Towards the end is a horrible idea that reminded me of Lebowski dreaming on his magic carpet. It builds to a climax that wobbles and topples like Cobb's dream totem in Inception. The audience in the cinema were clearly baffled and disappointed. I thought it was ok, but you need to reframe what the film is about to appreciate the film in its entirety. For me, the conclusion was that its about how individuals have individual needs and desires, and its about breaking through denial and repressions in all their forms to find happiness, rather than becoming distracted with bigger, unsolvable problems as some misguided form of sublimation.",First Reformed
100,cappiethadog,Real love,10,24 January 2019,"The enigma of ""First Reformed"" is not the ending. That can be explained. Paul Schrader, whose formative years were steeped in Calvinist doctrine, intermittently, can be a practicing nihilist, a heretic. Just look at the polarity of his filmmaking predecessors and contemporary, in regard to how they deal philosophically with religious subject matter. What does Schrader believe in: Turn the other cheek or eye for an eye? ""First Reformed"" is a high-wire act. The cinematic gods: Bergman, Bresson, and Scorsese are on that high-wire. Who will fall? Whose rhetoric, whose control of the balancing pole as an an armament of ideology is stronger? The battle of wills begin the moment that Father Toller(Ethan Hawke) and Mary(Amanda Seyfried) open the better book; the book of love. The camera transmogrifies. The camera is grace itself. It weighs the metaphysical against the physical and chooses wisely. No. There is an answer. The dogma of the film is knowable; it's empirical, and life itself, an epiphany to the father that will hopefully be a long-sustaining dawning, a verity, shared by the audience. The real enigma of ""First Reformed"" is Michael(Phillip Ettinger). What was Mary's husband going to do with that suicide vest?Michael didn't believe in God. Mary tells Father Toller that she was the spiritual one after her husband's suicide. That is the main difference between the young American couple and their Swedish counterparts in Ingmar Bergman's ""Winter Light"". Jonas Persson(Max Von Sydow) shares his wife's faith; he, too, wants God to wave a magic wand and make the cataclysmic science of atom bombs go away. Whereas Michael waits outside near the pews while Mary talks to Toller in the sacristy, Jones stands alongside Karin(Gunnel Lindblom) as she describes her husband's anxiety over China's potentiality for nuclearization to Tomas(Gunnar Bjornstrand), a robed man, tortured, and in flux. Instead of providing, at worst, the most rudimentary ecclesiastical words of rote recitation for his troubled congregant, the derelict priest abdicates his role as sympathetic witness, characterizing God as ""ugly and revolting...a spider,"" and drives Jonas to shoot himself. A man such as this, a superstitious provincial, supine to a fault, who unconditionally accepts that God is good, that God has all the answers; for a man such as this to suddenly learn from a church authority about God's indifference, God's silence, becomes tantamount to murder by rhetoric. Michael, on the other hand, a rational modern-day urbanite, disproportionate in his assiduousness championing for the planet's survival, whose faith is predicated on people's proper application of syllogism towards science, does not want to be lectured by the priest; he wants to debate him. The environmental activist sees in Toller a formidable opponent, somebody to challenge the church's stance against abortion. Michael asks, ""How do you sanction bringing a little girl into this world?"" as a way of sussing out Toller's position on climate change. Suddenly, the elephant is in the room. The elephant is Abundant Life, the priest's benefactor, a monolithic church who accepts money from Big Oil, which allows a satellite house of worship such as First Reformed to stay in its elliptic orbit. They get along. Michael can see that the priest is not a puppet espousing global warming denials. But sadly, Toller ends their talk on a bum note. The man of God tells the man of Science that ""bringing a child into this world cannot equal the despair of taking a child from it,"" erring just like the Swedish priest, but because Michael is an atheist, he compares the unborn with the dead, instead of the disconnect between Jonas' perception of God and Tomas'. In both cases, the nudging words leads the listener towards a path of permanent oblivion. Toller misses the point. Michael's child is going to die, too, but it will be a slow-motion death induced by the effects of a hemorrhaging planet. Better to die quickly, thinks Michael, like Toller's son, a bullet to the head in an Iraqi war zone. How can one know the mind of God...or man?Martyrdom is broached. Michael gets up from his seat and points at a vertical set of framed pictures by the doorway; they're pictures of activists who died for environmental causes. Mentioned first, perhaps, because they are dear to his heart, is the married couple who was gunned down by native minions of multi-nationals in the Amazon. Died trying, they did, to save the rain forest. Does Michael want the same thing for he and his wife; to be admired for fighting the righteous fight? During Mary's first meeting with Father Toller, the prospective mother speaks in violent language, telling the priest that her husband wants to kill their baby. Was Michael's fatalism so severe, he had wished to kill Mary and her unborn baby? Mary has an inkling. Mary might have known earlier about the existence of the suicide vest as was indicated to Toller. By having the priest confiscate it, she makes the conscious decision to live; to be a mother, not a martyr.Out of shame, or maybe out of anguish over his wife's abandonment of their plan, the martyr wanna-be dies by the same self-inflicted gunshot to the head as Jonas. The Swede loved God more than Karin. Michael loved the planet more than Mary. Toller almost makes the same mistake. ""I have found another form of prayer,"" he thinks to himself, standing outside of Balk Industries. Toller becomes radicalized. He puts on the suicide vest with an intent to kill his parishioners at a reconsecration ceremony for the benefit of the small church's ideologically arbitrated oratorical overlords. Abundant money, ironically, contributes to abundant death, not abundant life. Toller turns into the anti-hero from Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"". His transgressive behavior has the effect of reconstructing the cross that hangs in First Reformed into a lower case ""t"", as in ""t"" for Travis, or Toller. Both men, quite pointedly, write their innermost thoughts in a marble-colored composition book.Love saves. But it's not the love of God. The love of a woman saves. When Mary enters the minister's private quarters, Mother Earth's vigilante drops the glass of drain unclogging liquid he was about to down. He goes to her. They hug, hard; they kiss, hard. The camera revolves around them. Mary is the sun. The scene in this small room is a microcosm of the cosmos; the earth's relationship to the real sun. Toller joins her because this burning yellow orb, this love, can't harm him. The camera replicates the planet's eliptical orbit around the sun.Love makes the world go around.",First Reformed

It doesn't hit you over the head with a bunch of mandated/approved ideas.For some (maybe most) it'll be a bit too slow and the ending might leave you unsatisfied. I loved it all because everything in the film was so deliberate, if it's ambiguous, it means to be.I put this with 'It's a Wonderful Life', 'Last Tempation of Christ', & 'Silence', it's in the pantheon of great religious movies.

Writer-director Paul Schrader's past screenplays include Scorsese classics Taxi Driver and Raging Bull, and First Reformed manages to live up to that high standard. This is a very smartly written film that manages to juggle a number of huge themes - environmentalism, climate change, mental illness, addiction, existentialism, conspiracy, martyrdom, religion and its intersection with capitalism - with finesse and confidence. Every character and plot development in the film work harmoniously together to thoroughly explore these ideas as it builds, increasingly unsettlingly, towards its memorable and potent conclusion. Though the film is dark and at times quite disturbing - which is very much thanks in part to the absolutely chilling score by dark ambient musician Lustmord - it also smartly throws quite a bit of dry, black comedy into the mix to play up the more absurd aspects of the story. Ethan Hawke gives an excellent, layered performance as well of a character whose outward composure conceals his swirling inner turmoil. Overall an accomplished and unsettling examination of some highly topical themes with a strong screenplay that's likely to reveal more with repeat viewings.Light 4.5/5",First Reformed

When I see movies like Harry Potter or Wonder Woman getting rave reviews... It makes me wonder why. Then Ive read the idea that online film criticism makes its money through advertisements. Even the NYT, which in itself was one of the most respected film criticism pieces has fallen subject to the online advertisement debacle. Paul Schrader (who wrote Taxi Driver) is not from this era. He does not have to pander to get films made by saying he will do exactly as what the advertisers want. These days thats social commentary and social justice because hey! It sells! If you dont believe me... Look how much trump made during his presidency for social media and major media publications. He has single handedly destroyed any credibility those organizations have left by turning all the publications into national enquirers... With all this being said... Schraders film is political yes... But he looks at the transcendental issues going on in the world today. You dont have to take this as some political social justice alagory. It is a film about the spiritual realm and the existence of one during a major crisis. How it can impact the mental state of a very spiritual person. This is why it is hard to read some of these reviews... Because half of these people on here are young and impressionable and have been reading terrible reviewers who need to make an advertising buck.... And the NYT has a political agenda to change film based on the social commentary thats driving newer films forward... Sadly with this... Every film is going to be based on whether youre a democrat or a republican based on the content provided in the film... This is why you shouldnt read too many online film criticisms.

It does start out with what are some interesting soliloquies by the main character played by Hawke, just enough to keep you watching even though you know the film is a dud. Piss poor art direction, awkward location selection , it is akin to the uncomfortable feeling you get in a crowded, silent elevator, when you watch this movie. The dialogue is stilted and nothing seems natural or more important a seamless, a narrative in which a good movie carries you along. The female lead delivers a good performance but with material that is less than sub standard , IE , not thought out. The art house crowd might find it "" thought provoking"" or edgy, edgy like broken glass, the final scene is tortured in its gratuitous qualities but not surprising because the film , which hadn't gone anywhere to begin with had to get to some destination no matter how unsatisfying or nonsensical. Thought provoking , yes , I thought how did this get green lighted ? The studios are throwing money at producers for content, 3rd rate content I surmise.

A minister of a small congregation in upstate New York grapples with mounting despair brought on by tragedy, worldly concerns and a tormented past (IMDB).REVIEW:
This one should be short. For me, this film really came down to a slow burn that didn't have a gratifying finish. I understand the battle of Hope and Despair in this film and what Toller (Ethan Hawke) is going through, however, it didn't touch me in any real or film related way. I struggle to find why this film had so much Oscar buzz back in 2017 other than the fact that it's an independent film released by A24. People raved about Ethan Hawke's acting and not to say it's bad, but not Oscar worthy. It was just another role as it was with Amanda Seyfried. If I had to pick a standout performance, I would pick the small part that Philip Ettinger played.To conclude, nothing stood out in this film. Not the direction or acting, writing or any other pillar of making a film that makes it great and not just good. It's not one I'll go back too and I'm sure it's one that'll be forgotten. 5/10.",First Reformed

Although he didn't kill anyone, at least Mary is still alive and his death might spark some debates on the issues he so cares about.

114,realityinmind,"Sorry, but these reviews seriously obfuscate the truth...",5,12 August 2018,"This movie is not some great wonder of cinema that needs to be seen by everyone. This movie falls flat on so many levels. Nothing happens for the first 1 hr 15 min of the movie. And the movie is only 2 hours long. I mean, seriously.... nothing happens. The buildup is so slow it is uninteresting. And then it escalates rather quickly towards the end into the most anticlimactic finish imaginable. And if you know anything about Christianity and the Church you would know that a man in Ethan Hawke's character's position would never go the route that he did with such little justification SO QUICKLY. It is not feasible. It takes much more to ""turn"" someone (so to speak). I'm surprised Paul Schrader, who grew up in a Church of the same denomination and attained a theology degree (BA) in college, would attempt to paint things in such a weakly constructed light.And I'm not even a Christian. But I grew up in the Church and I know enough about it to know that this is not realistic.This movie seems more like liberal propaganda meant to undermine the meaning of Christianity. A person in Ethan Hawke's character's position is not so easily befuddled by the science discussed in this movie. And that is where the true light of this movie shines... on a science that Christians don't care about because they are not wrapped up in it and misinformed about it like mainstream liberals. But since they view it as their own religion they think that it is as strong as Christianity to a Christian. The term to describe this movie the best would be ""boring"". There are 5 interesting moments in this movie, and the first one doesnt occur for almost an hour.

115,rioplaydrum,Unbelievably Bad Ending,3,7 June 2018,"I don't normally write reviews with spoilers. This story comes completely undone with in the last five minutes. And does so in such a fashion I managed to practically dismiss everything good from the beginning.The quiet but steadfast Pastor Toller is a token Pastor in a tiny token church financed by a much larger religious organization known as Abundant Life.Toller already has faced a fair amount of pain and loss, his son killed in the Iraqi war only six months into his first deployment, which lead to his divorce. Toller is quietly plagued by alcoholism and guilt as a result. He also has the added anxiety of now facing terminal cancer.A young married couple, Michael and Mary, come to the Pastor for counseling as Michael wants his wife to abort their coming baby. Michael is completely obsessed with the idea of total global environmental meltdown by the year 2050, and can not bear the thought of his child being handed an unlivable world. The good Pastor Toller very much enjoys engaging Michael for the sake of avoiding the abortion, and feels he is gaining ground to give the soon to be father some badly needed hope.The cinematography greatly captures the mood with most scenes so darkly lit and in late fall, just before the advent of a long and cold New York winter.There is a near complete lack of a soundtrack as well to deepen the severity of the conversations and the Pastor's own private musings.Michael then abruptly commits suicide, dooming Toller to find his body minus half his head. Toller now takes on Michael's grave environmental concerns, and it doesn't help when he discovers the main benefactor of his parent church is none other than a man who runs one of the biggest corporate polluters on the list.Toller is already in the possession of a suicide bomb-vest, homemade by the late Michael.The suspense at this point is thick enough to be cut with a knife. But the incredibly weak, silly and scattered ending destroys everything one might be on the edge of their seat expecting.Does he blow up the church with all the evil, rich polluters? No. Does he commit suicide by drinking Drano? No.He instead wraps himself up in barbed-wire and makes out with his girlfriend.

117,birck,Beautifully done but flawed,8,24 June 2018,"I'll try to avoid actually spoiling the film. The central characters are all beautifully played, and the film has a brain and uses it. The principal story line is the gradual absorption of the ideals of one character by another, following a life-and-death discussion between two men near the beginning of the film. One is a despairing, committed environmental activist, the other is an equally despairing (for different reasons) clergyman. For reasons I won't go into, the Reverend is forced to accept the depth of the other man's commitment, and that conversion drives the second half of the story. One of the weaknesses in the film is that we don't see much evidence beyond that, of the clergyman's change in attitude toward the environment. He gets into an argument with a powerful local environmental predator, but that single scene doesn't seem (to me) to be enough to justify the violence hinted at in the ending. Another weakness, as I see it, is the fact that the environmental activist is named Joseph, and his pregnant wife is Mary. So what? The obvious reference goes unexplored and unexplained, since the ending leaves the world no better off, no less befouled by the moneychangers and profiteers than it was at the beginning.
 In spite of those weaknesses, the story is rivetting. The acting is spot-on, and the production values are top-notch. I recommend it, and I would gladly watch it again.",First Reformed

The time has come for judging the dead, and for rewarding your servants the prophets and your people who revere your name, both great and small--and for destroying those who destroy the earth."" Revelations 11:18Why did I just quote a verse from the Bible that was in the film? To seem pretentious? Maybe, but no. The above verse perfectly encapsulates the Christian condition--inescapable. You are either a ""servant"" or ""prophet"", or you are a ""destroyer of the earth"". This is the dogma that every Christian who at least tries to respect religion beyond its classification has to deal with. There is no escape. Paul Schrader, one of the essential artists of modern film making, deals with the downward spiral of mind and soul-bending contradictions which have tormented him for his entire life. All through the eyes of an alcoholic and troubled minister of a small congregation in the state of New York.The script of ""First Reformed"", also written by Paul Schrader, the man behind two of Martin Scorsese's masterpieces in my eyes (""Taxi Driver"", ""The Last Temptation of Christ"") is complex, filled with narration. For once, I feel that Schrader transcended conventional screen-writing and simply put pen to paper to his deepest thoughts. It is art in the form of therapy, yet one that does not work. Schrader is aware of this, but he will not stop struggling. This is the key to this film. He torments not only the lead character, Reverend Ernst Toller (Ethan Hawke in the performance of a lifetime), but also the viewer and it goes on and on and on...This film finds itself at two very interesting points. Organized religion and environmentalism--two philosophies that should go hand-in-hand as they both share the good of the world, yet as the film progresses, what is white becomes more and more grey. In one of the early scenes, Toller is called to have a talk with a depressed and hopeless environmentalist, Michael (Philip Ettinger) about the unsolvable state of the planet. Michael backs up everything with stats, so it is truly difficult to argue with him. Not a religious man, he also poses the one question that will set in motion Toller's inevitable fall into despair: ""Will God forgive us for what we've done to the Earth?"" Toller answers ambiguously. This scene is a perfect example of a master screenwriter at work. It is contradictory, thought-provoking and baffling.Paul Schrader said he wanted to make a ""transcendental"" film world. In all honesty, I don't know what he means by that, but I felt an outwordly vision in ""First Reformed"", and I do mean vision. It is filmed in a classic 4:3 aspect ratio, but every frame has the camera set to angular perfection while a constant booming sound denotes anxiety. The world of first-reformed looks like ready to be put to judgment. This is one of the things that a masterpiece does. It manifests its concepts through actual visual austerity, giving image to unseen emotions.I really feel that ""First Reformed"" is more than a great film. It is a retrospective and a therapy of an old man who had a very religious upbringing, and as an ex-film critic, a man who experienced the art of cinema as both an informant and a soldier. With its characters portrayed in a lifeless exclusivity and an ending which was as short as it was piercing, ""First Reformed"" is a purgatorial experience, but one that deserves your patience as much as you deserve its warning.",First Reformed

122,don2507,"""Every Act of Preservation is an Act of Creation. It's How We Participate in Creation.""",8,15 December 2018,"I must begin by saying that Ethan Hawke's character in ""First Reformed"" is NOT a priest, as a number of reviewers have written on this site. His collar is not typical of a Roman Catholic priest; he's been married and divorced and had a son; and you'd be extremely unlikely to find a Catholic priest presiding at a church called ""First Reformed."" As most of you know, he's a minister of a Protestant church (Dutch Reformed).Anyway, the film is an absorbing, albeit slow-paced, depiction of the spiritual odyssey of a troubled pastor at a small, historic church in upstate New York. He's divorced, feels guilt over his only son's death in Iraq (because he counseled him to serve there), is in ill-health and is drinking, and his church, bereft of members, is financially dependent on a mega-church, the aptly-named Abundant Life which seems to preach a prosperity sort of message. I was fortunate to have seen Bergman's ""Winter Light"" at a local art house only weeks before seeing ""First Reformed"" at home, and the parallels are striking as director Paul Schrader readily acknowledges. There's a crucial difference, though, in that the Lutheran pastor in Bergman's film flat out tells his troubled congregant that he can't help him and angrily confesses his atheism while the pastor in Schrader's film earnestly and prayerfully provides insight to his congregant who's very upset by what humans have done to the earth and does not want his pregnant wife's child to be born into this polluted world. Rev. Toller may at times show shades of agnosticism but it's my perception that his oft-alluded ""crisis of faith"" has more to do with a loss of faith with social institutions, malign influences on churches (he finds that polluting firms financially sponsor the parent Abundant Life church), and, in his view, the success of churches that preach that faith leads to (material) abundance; for example, he replies to an earnest young Christian who asks him his thoughts about a person unemployed for over six months to which he replies that ""God does not promise prosperity"" for which he's berated by this eager member of the Abundant Life church. The film visually contrasts the austere, traditional church of Rev. Toller with the huge, well-lit amphitheater of the more market/consumer-friendly Abundant Life church.The film repeatedly asks if God will forgive us for how we've treated the Earth with pollution and man-made global warming. In effect, the film provides a spiritual meaning to environmentalism. While Genesis may have given man dominion over the earth, Christian churches increasingly see pollution and environmental degradation as a sin on God's creation and on our earthly home. Evangelical churches have called it ""creation care"" (although some evangelical churches have reportedly rebuked their Pastors for ""environmental preaching"" because they associate environmental concerns with left-wing causes). ""First Reformed"" nicely blends the spiritual focus of a social / political cause with the spiritual angst of a likable, well-meaning, but deeply troubled Pastor.I've knocked two stars off what is a very good film because the ending is extreme under certain interpretations but more understandable under other, more speculative interpretations.",First Reformed

Because he didn't wrote about it, he told no one about it, there was no point of reference to his little revolution in the end. Everybody just would think, poor man, he found out he had cancer and decided to kill himself, he, a devoted Man of God... I mean, who would find this film remotely interesting?

Maybe I'm too cynical for this film as I have a birth defect and have real problems, but it's too hard to sit through a film where someone has lost their faith due to climate change. Really?

Either the nomination was for the climate change points or an apology for not nominating Schrader in the past. In either case, poor move.As for directing, I've never been so uninspired by a director. The movie plays like a student film, albeit a promising student's film. The problem is Schrader has been doing this for a long time now. Kevin Smith moves the camera more.I forced myself to finish it just to see if it ever went anywhere. It did. It took a giant leap that made me chuckle.

Then came the ending, or should I say we're still waiting. The film started to lose me with the levitation scene. Schrader borrowed and stole and tricked his way to the finale, then apparently ran out of ideas and turned off the camera. I thought this sort of ""dramatic"" finish went out with the Sopranos. So, am I a bad person because I don't blow up oil refineries? Is somebody's god going to smite me for driving my car instead of levitating to my destination? Good acting. Silly writing.

I felt cheated to have sat through the whole movie only to get an ending like that. And yet other reviewers are singing high praises and jumping into the bandwagon just because everybody else is doing it.

133,reid-hawk,Less of an homage and more of a rip-off of 'Taxi Driver',8,2 August 2018,"'First Reformed' is written and directed by th same man who wrote 'Taxi Driver', one of my favorite films of all time and probably one of the greatest character studies in cinema history. This film seems to follow in its footsteps as a film that looks into a dark man who becomes increasingly disillusioned and angry with society, but goes from blurring to eventually crossing the line of an homage into a sort of rip off. This begins with a scene where our main character, played masterfully by Ethan Hawke, pours pepto bismol into his drink. So far the film has consisted of still, wider shots with little to no camera movement, but in this scene that all changes. It focuses in on the dissolving pepto bismol in a scene that is all too similar to the famous dissolving alka seltzer scene in 'Taxi Driver'. ""No problem though"", I thought, because I loved the scene in 'Taxi Driver' and I like that the film is diverging from the set style it has going on. But then it gets towards the ending, and man I just saw it coming from a mile away. The main character plans to attack somebody powerful, much like Travis Bickle did. The main character is thwarted at the last second, again like the protagonist of 'Taxi Driver'. And finally the movie ends in an ambiguous possible dream sequence where the main character's fantasy comes true. Sound familiar? It's frustrating too, because besides a bad ""fake body"" used at the end as Ethan Hawke's character mutilates himself and some luls in the plot, I really don't have many other complaints. I love the cinimatography and weird aspect ratio, i loved the minimalistic use of a score, where it is really only played at all in the latter 3rd half of the film for tension, and above all I loved the acting from everyone in the film. It's a shame that it refused to branch out and be its own thing in the end, when it could have been so much more unique and unexpected, or at the very least exciting, like the hallucinatory sequence that takes place towards the end of the second act of the film. Overall though I definitely recommend it to anyone willing to sit through a dark and depressing look at a lonely human who struggles and succumbs to the darkness and dispair from a real issue that plagues modern day society.",First Reformed
134,littlemankazoo,'Taxi Driver' meets Christianity in character piece of Academy Award-worthy proportions,8,21 May 2018,"In terms of stories of religion and faith, it is not very often that I see ones that present me with an interesting story that shows a quandary of beliefs. It is also not often that I see stories of religion and faith that feature a character and performance that is on-par with that of Travis Bickle from 'Taxi Driver'.In 'First Reformed', I got both, and it is absolutely enthralling.Ethan Hawke stars as Reverend Holler, a man of strong religious beliefs that gets caught in the crossfire of a changing world, both in the realm of the church and of business. Thus, he spirals-into an inner turmoil that threatens to break more than just himself.'First Reformed' pits the world of the church and Christianity of a yesteryear against the world of religion now, which is just as full of its own questionable pitfalls as classical religion is viewed to hold. Now, personally, I lack a horse in this battle of ethics.At the same time, however, the subject was so intriguing to behold as the main conflict and themes of this intriguing story of 'religion-gone-Taxi Driver' that I couldn't help but stay deeply-entrenched in the conflict we see Ethan Hawke's character in.Classical vs. Modern. Mega-churches vs. Traditionalist churches. Man vs. Society. We see all these conflicts unfold within 'First Reformed' and its tightly-packed run-time.All the while, this conflict is portrayed in pitch-perfect fashion by Ethan Hawke, who delivers what I can only describe as his greatest performance of his career. His is truly next-level in this film, and I cannot describe enough to you about how captivating it is to watch Hawke in this film. He is spectacular in this, and an early frontrunner for the Academy Award without a doubt in my mind.This film is not without its own bundle of flaws, to be fair. Certain sequences me made question the intent and decisions made by director Paul Schrader, and the ending itself is something I'm still not terribly sure I agree with in terms of its content. However, these flaws are not truly enough to take away from how much I abundantly enjoyed the majority of this film.In the end, this film is all about faith. Faith being challenged. Faith being destroyed by a changing society around you. Faith's duality in man. Ultimately, the film is about Faith, and how Hope and Despair are ultimately intertwined in such an unsure and changing time in our world.In the world of film, the tales of religion vary from spectacular to the mundane. In this case, I feel it falls somewhere on the higher end. While not spectacular, 'First Reformed' is certainly one of the best pieces of film that 2018 has had to offer thus far.Once it hits wider release, you should definitely check it out. I guarantee the faith you put in it will be worth it~",First Reformed

136,CitizenKaneAAAAA,Finally! Schrader!,9,6 August 2018,"There are some film that comes to my mind when i watch this film: Winter Light, The Devil Probably, The Diary of a Country Priest, Sacrifice, and Nostalghia. Paul Schrader has said that this film have the same root and feel with the directors whose films i just mentioned. but then, i also find a connection to his previous film Taxi Driver, both Toller and Travis Bickle had a different perception towards the world they were living.Toller was a troubled man to say the least, he was haunted by his past, present, and also his future. his son was killed and then his marriage crumbled, he has a cancer now, and he is worried about the future of the planet. he was also experiencing doubt about everything that he was preaching, and he wrote his doubt on a diary as a form of prayer hoping to find answer someday. it's hard not to hear the voice of god, the voice of certainty when you need it the most, to float on a space and time not knowing what to do, Toller was also highly depressed, he was either had a little common sense or too much sense to live in the world or the REAL world as Reverend Joel Jeffers called it. Toller has no place in the world where he could find peace, it's his curse, he sees no way out.Paul Schrader's strength has always been in his character, it's always complex and merciless, but as much as he cared about the foreground, he is also cared about the background, the setting, First Reformed is the name of a ""tourist"" church owned by a company or an organization named Abundant Life, it's more like a company rather than a belief society, one of the referend was laughing at a funny stuff that Martin Luther was doing, etc. this setting helped to create a character so dark and secluded that it could only existed in Paul's universe.",First Reformed
137,tomfeller,Clergyman has spiritual crisis,7,9 May 2019,"The title refers to a small but historic church in upstate New York which is celebrating its 250th birthday. It was a stop on the Underground Railroad, for example. It is now owned by a mega-church known as ""Abundant Life"" and is primarily a tourist attraction. Ethan Hawke plays its alcoholic pastor, Ernst Toller, who was once an army chaplain whose son was killed in Iraq and whose marriage broke up because of it. Toller is going through both a mid-life crisis and a cancer diagnosis. Then a young woman named Mary (Amanda Seyfried) asks him to counsel her environmental activist husband Michael (Philip Ettinger). Mary is pregnant and wants to keep the baby, but Michael wants her to abort it, because he does not want to bring a baby into a world on the edge of ecological collapse. Toller becomes deeply involved in their lives. The film is very intense and well-acted, especially by Cedric Kyles, aka Cedric the Entertainer, as the pastor of the mega-church and Victoria Hill as its choir director, but I did not like how it ended. It was written and directed by Paul Schrader, who was nominated for an Oscar in the Original Screenplay category.",First Reformed
138,t-unknown-one,Started with great atmosphere but then...,7,6 August 2018,"It started with an atmospheric mood that was somehow reminiscent of Fargo (the movie, not the series) - there was that bleak sense of small town simplicity that was almost funny without really being funny. It seemed almost pathetic but the sense of 'plain-ness' was somehow gripping, somehow drew me in and made it watchable. As another reviewer put it, there was a shift to the surreal later on that just seemed out of place. It was like we went from a more tragic Fargo feel to a Life Of Pi feel rather unexpectedly. This broke the mood that had been building irreparably (for me). The ending scene reminded me of an indie film called ""Last Night"" which was a movie about how ppl chose to spend their last day at the end of the world. I was somewhat dissatisfied with the ending in this case though. Overall, I would still recommend this movie for the better parts, the thought provoking subject matter, though a true Christian wouldn't find anything useful here.",First Reformed
139,ockiemilkwood,"Love, Not Ideology",10,24 August 2018,"This is a brilliant commentary on our times. The air today is filled with the shrill, judgemental shrieks of ideology. Political correctness has sunk to fascism. This includes Earth First and other extremist envirofascists, as well as Antifa, Black Lives Matter, etc. Identity politics is the closed mind of hypocrisy, fear and loathing. Michael, Mary's husband, is a jihadist, no different from ISIS, an ideologue who subscribes to a twisted, monochromatic view of the world, just like ISIS. Pastor Toller, who is an incomplete man and cripple like Michael, becomes infected by Michael's masochistic nihilism, to the tune of Neil Young's simple-minded stupidity and self-righteousness (cf., Skynyrd's Sweet Home Alabama). Dostoevsky portrayed this activist, revolutionary nihilism to perfection in Demons (aka Devils). It's not new. Love of Mary, who is a mother to be, just like the Virgin Mary, and who even bears the same name, is the only way out. It's not anti-global warming ideology. It's not organized religion, also an ideology. It's not the ideology of Marxist/Progressive anti capitalism. That abrupt, unexpected embrace at the very end felt so good, felt so right.

He is wound up taut, ready to explode in all manners of speaking - you feel it thought the screen. There is juxtaposition, there are layers to peel away - for a movie that at many moments seems to have so little going on, there is an abundance of the human condition in almost every scene, in the characters, in the foreground, in the background.

144,ollie1939-97-957994,Hawke and Schrader deliver the best work of both of their careers.,10,2 June 2018,"First Reformed is one of the most effective character studies that I can think of in recent memory. Schrader has both gone back to his roots delivering a Taxi Driver like protagonist at its centre whilst also using modern political and social issues to keep the material relevant. The story deals with a priest and former veteran coming to grips with his own faith when a young woman comes seeking his help and guidance. 
Schrader relies primarily on atmosphere and the performances to tell his story. Hawke's Priest Toller is a loner that struggles with alcohol and his past, in the same vein that many of Schrader's characters have often done. The movie is often uncomfortable and is certainly pretty humourless overall, but it draws you that you completely forget about these elements. 
As a fan of many of Ethan Hawke's performances, I can honestly say without a doubt this is the best performance of his career. Much of the intensity that comes from the film comes from his performance, whether he is eventually going to break. Hawke completely morphs into the character, believing him at almost every step of the way. The supporting cast, including Amanda Seyfried and Cedric the Entertainer also deliver extremely potent and effective performances. 
The movie is also beautifully shot, with the 1.37:1 aspect ratio helping to display Toller's mentally claustrophobic mentality. The shots of factories and rural American towns add to the film's atmosphere. 
It's a slow burn and may not be to everyone's liking but it's an effective character study that use a great actor and director to their full potential.",First Reformed

Ethan Hawke, who is a consistent favorite and an underrated performance artist, in my opinion, really invests himself into his roles, and ""First Reformed"" is no exception. Hawke plays the role of Reverend Toller, a congregation leader at an antiquated church, which barely draws a handful of people every Sunday, and is on the verge of celebrating it's 250th anniversary. With the Church basically being a museum, Toller takes pride in touring families, and has even turned the upper level, complete with broken organ, into a gift shop, full of hats, t-shirts, and mugs. As the first reformed church is on the verge of its 250th anniversary, the neighboring Abundant Life Church has chosen to pick up the bill for the festivities, complete with simulcast over the internet. Beneath the surface, Toller is dealing with a worried couple, where mainly the husband, is concerned about the future of the Earth, and whether it is responsible to bring in a child to live in it. Chaos ensues throughout and there is a large undercurrent of environmental protection being thrown in our faces throughout.

155,hughrcarson,"A challenging, morally-conscious journey",8,18 October 2018,"A short but very intense friendship with a troubled environmental activist proves to be the catalyst for much self-reflection, introspection and upheaval in the life of Reverend Toller.A short time prior to this, Toller had vowed to keep a diary for a year in which he would ponder the existential issues of life, love, death and religion.And come the year's end he has vowed to destroy the diary.As a 'man of the cloth' much would understandably be expected of Toller, though the fact that he is somewhat squirrelled away as the Pastor of the under-performing, relatively insignificant First Reformed Church - essentially an historic tourist attraction of Dutch origin, and certainly nothing particularly high profile - is the first hint that the Church's owners, Abundant Life, have only limited faith in Toller's ability to carry out the sort of duties required of a Pastor at any sort of meaningful level.That said, the church is fast approaching its 250th anniversary and Toller has been tasked with putting together a suitable celebration to mark the occasion.This would be a straight forward enough task for someone of sane and rational mind, but as is gradually revealed in Paul Schrader's challenging film, Toller is very much a man with a tragic and troubled past; one that very much impacts upon his mental state and approach to an equally troubling present. The undoubted weight of the responsibility required for the Church's anniversary celebrations therefore hangs heavy on the already heavily distracted Pastor's shoulders.Ethan Hawke is in excellent form with a strong, nuanced performance portraying the fundamentally flawed Pastor, Toller, a man who has deliberately created a life for himself shorn entirely of all unnecessary accoutrements. Such an absence of possessions in many ways reflects the increasing emptiness within his own soul; a void that he repeatedly fills with a growing dependency on alcohol.Schrader's film takes a morally-conscious contemplative journey from climate and pollution concerns to the corruption and self-serving nature of man, digging deep to get to the real heart of the Reverend Toller's troubles, and it is therefore an understandably bleak affair.It's only really the burgeoning friendship between the Pastor and Mary (Amanda Seyfried), that in any way breaks through an at times seemingly all-pervading hopeless gloom that engulfs Toller as he wrestles manfully with the moral concerns of both his own life and those of others.Straight forward and refreshingly conservative in its direction, First Reformed is a weighty, thought-provoking and at times unashamedly desperate film, though one not entirely bereft of the promise of salvation.This and hundreds of other films are reviewed on my WAYWARDWOLFBLOG",First Reformed
156,Kings_Requiem,I don't want God's forgiveness... I want his help!,9,10 June 2018,"'First Reformed' is an extremely challenging film. Maybe the most challenging that I've seen. I expected nothing less from Paul Schrader, though, as he's written and directed a lot of challenging stuff over the years. It's slow, methodical and exacting. It asks important questions but does not give any easy answers (or answers in general for that matter)...Ethan Hawke's performance at the epicenter of this film really is a towering achievement. It's the kind of performance that will do down as not only one of the best of the year, but this will be remembered (most likely) as his career best. Ernst Toller is a man struggling internally with immense pain and turmoil. The loss of his only child has caused his marriage to fall apart so he has since turned to the Lord for whatever form of relief he can find. Nothing will ever take away that pain, but he's at least been able to somewhat cope with it over the years...though he has never really found true peace or happiness and has since turned to the bottle (like most men seem to) for solace. He writes in a journal every day as a form of self prayer or maybe just a way to put his ruinous thoughts down on paper instead of keeping them bottled up where they could potentially do more harm. A meeting with a local man one day where a multitude of different end-of-the-world topics are discussed ends up leading the Reverend down a rabbit-hole of immense consequences. All of which cause Toller to question his commitment to God and the Church. He's the pastor of a small local church that are all but extinct now and every city is being overrun with these massive churches. Faith has become a spectacle run by mostly phonies who only care about the bottom-line instead of the people and the close-knit community - another thing that frustrates him. Ethan Hawke is able to quietly walk this emotional tightrope the entire film and never allows him to fall into any histrionics. Amanda Seyfried takes on the important role of Mary (one of only 2 main female roles) and she delivers her best performance as well. Mary becomes a integral part of the Reverend's life as they're able to help each other through these difficult times...although it can be kinda hard to see what ways she really helps him. Cedric ""The Entertainer"" Kyles also shows up along the way as the pastor of the big conglomerate church who, despite good intentions, is probably doing more harm than good.I feel like it really demands to be seen whether you're a person of faith or not. This is definitely not your typical Christian film and that's probably gonna upset a lot of people, but this one (and Schrader) have more lofty ideas and weighty themes on their mind. This is a very dense screenplay which leads to a heavy film that expects a lot from the audience. Paul Schrader isn't letting anyone off the hook easily here...he's being patient and letting the film open up at its own pace. This is also the kind of film that doesn't divulge all of its secrets in one sitting...it expects you to come back to it and soak it all in over multiple viewings - which with a film of this ilk you should probably do anyway.Paul Schrader and company have created something wholly unique and special with 'First Reformed' and I think it's definitely something to be valued.

But if you remember the scene from The Producers where everyone in the audience is just looking at each other in disbelief before Dick Shawn makes his appearance, that is the exact reaction of the audience to the end of the movie when I watched it.

160,ddmcd-34250,Excellent and mature,9,11 June 2018,"Phrases like ""crisis of faith"" are common to interviews of this movie. While that is touched on in the movie it's much more than that and is arguably one of the most intense studies of an individual wrestling with personal demons I've ever seen.What is most impressive is how First Reformed uses real world situations including the environment, organized religion, politics, and alcoholism as a backdrop for the main character's journey through despair. That said, what is the point of this meticulously scripted, photographed, acted, edited, and directed film?Each serious adult viewer of this film will come away with is his or her own unique perspective. The following is my own.The story: Rev. Ernst Toller, having suffered the death of a child and a failed marriage, is assigned to run a tiny centuries-old church in upstate New York. Once a stop for a escaped slaves in the Underground Railroad, the church's tiny congregation is dwindling and the church serves as little more than a ""tourist church.""Totter, descending into alcoholism and experiencing severe personal medical problems, begins to write a personal journal to help him work through his own despair. Into his life comes a young woman, now pregnant, whose husband, an over-the-top environmental activist, thinks it's wrong to bring another child into a decaying world.She asks Toller to speak with her husband. He does so. The resulting conversation is the centerpiece of the film. For the first time we see Toller wrestle with another person's beliefs while realizing he cannot do so without coming to terms with his own. The events that follow further tie Toller into the events and people that surround him, sometimes with tragic results.This is the first film in my memory when, having just seen the film at a local theater, I wanted to get a copy of the script to read, it's that good. I don't think there is a lot of improvisation here. If there is, the actors and the director are remarkably synchronized, even in the small parts. Everyone is very convincing. Ethan Hawke as the main character has received much deserved praise but, really, everyone is excellent.I'm glad that in this world of special effects laden action and superhero films it is still possible to make and see movies like First Redemption. Putting together the financing for this film given its high production values and story intensity may not have been easy. For now, though, everyone involved can be justly proud of this excellent and mature film.",First Reformed

162,jsteiger,Ultimately a huge disappointment,2,19 August 2018,"Having found some of Schrader's previous work interesting, and recognizing the potential in the movie's cast, I went in with high hopes.The hopes were not justified. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. You'll leave the theater shocked and angry, unless your admiration for Schrader's previous work overrides your critical faculties.SPOILERS FOLLOW.The movie begins in promising fashion. Superb, yet subtle set design, marked by excellent, muted use of color and dim lighting to create a somber, depressed atmosphere. The leads are well cast.Unfortunately, the writing is extremely weak, and the entirely unnecessary, completely unbalanced and unsubtle, smack-you-over-the-head ""environmentalist"" message quickly carries us into cartoon territory.Nothing stands up to close examination. The priest learns that one of his parish members has ""a problem."" His wife is pregnant, he is obsessed with environmental pollution and nihilism, and doesn't want her to have the baby. After an awkward first meeting, during which we discover that the priest encouraged his son to go to Iraq where he died, and that his wife left him he agrees to meet with the young man a second time. In between, he discovers that the young man has constructed a suicide vest. At this point the narrative goes completely off the rails.It is clear that the young man is violently suicidal. Anyone with any sense of morality would immediately demand that the young man be taken into protective custody. Instead the priest, who has no known expertise in high explosives, carries the vest out to his car! Did anyone watching this film not notice that there was no ""instructions manual"" with the suicide vest? Nobody with an IQ above 70 would grab a packet of high explosives under these circumstances.The young man finds out that his suicide vest is missing, and shotguns himself to death. The priest, who consumes high quality whiskey like coffee, is extremely ill, and over the next few days finds the time to become an environmental extremist AND have a bizarre levitation-tryst with the comely wife of the suicide victim. The wife, played by Amanda Seyfried, reads some of the dumbest lines I've ever heard with earnest seriousness. One can only imagine the dozens of giggling outtakes generated during the filming of this scene. Totally unbelievable on any level.There is a ""reconsecration"" ceremony in the works. The priest plans to protest the destruction of the environment (I think---his motivation is a complete mystery) by blowing himself up (along with a bunch of parishioners, one would presume) with the suicide vest. Exactly how he has divined the correct operation of the vest is a complete mystery. Why he would want to kill numerous parishioners (or at least ruin their Sunday best clothing with a rain of his body parts) is an even bigger mystery.At the last minute, he changes his mind and wraps himself in barbed wire, at which point Amanda Seyfried enters his office and they start passionately kissing. Bam, the screen goes black, and the credits roll to an ominous, rumbling musical piece.Crazed environmentalists might somehow find an encouraging and/or meaningful message in all this. Personally, I found it to be incredibly arrogant and insultingly incoherent. The sensational violence in Taxi Driver and Raging Bull at least had some rational connection to a messages of alienation, and the character development in both movies was superb. In First Reformed, the character development is extremely weak and simply doesn't support the characters' behavior. What, precisely, motivates Amanda Seyfried to feel passion for this physically wrecked, horrendously depressed, nasty man? We saw him, in a previous scene, crush the feelings of his former lover Esther (played beautifully by Victoria Hill) as if she were some kind of insect.What about the heavy-handed use of environmentalist concern as the main motivation for the young man's suicidal depression? Schrader trots out the the ""97% of climate scientists agree"" canard. The study that yielded the 97% figure has been debunked so thoroughly that nobody with a shred of intellectual honesty uses it. Our rivers and streams are actually far less polluted now than they were 30 years ago. Yet, in short order, one man has blown his own head off and another is preparing to blow himself up over the issue. This movie had the potential to be great. A superb cast, some intriguing issues, a fine cinematographer. Schrader simply blew it with a lazy writing effort. His fans will find a way to praise this by simply ignoring his failure.

165,travisyoung,More Than Courage,10,3 November 2018,"If you do not watch ""First Reformed"" before the end of your life, then you have missed out on a great opportunity.Most of the time, watching a film is a way to spend time intentionally escaping the reality of our own lives. Of course, actors, directors, writers, producers, and studios are very aware of this, and consequently exploit the fantastic. This is why there is such a preponderance of superhero and other genre-typifying films littering the current landscape. If you expect a popular film made in the past twenty years to suspend disbelief, you will be very disappointed.Distinct from those and much more rare and rewarding are films that seem plausible and make you feel. These kind of films are usually considered classics, not only because of their high critical regard, but also because they offer a reality that motivates us in a visceral way. Whether lighthearted or extremely dense, movies such as this make us care, and that response stays with us long after the credits roll and we are better for it.There is even a more uncommon and satisfying echelon of film than what I have already described, and that is what ""First Reformed"" qualifies as: a profound life experience. Movies like this inhabit a present reality that transcends art and becomes a part of who we are. In other words, we are irrevocably transformed in some internal way by experiencing the motion picture playing before us.Reverend Ernst Toller (Ethan Hawke) is the divorced forty-six year old pastor of First Reformed Church in upstate New York. While his church building is a historic landmark, his congregation consists of only a handful of people. As his first name suggests, he takes his role as a servant to his flock, his community, and his God with sincerity and conviction. Mostly, he finds himself trying to satisfy every whim of those within his sphere of influence by performing a variety of tasks that range from menial but necessary to thankless and beneath him. There are a few key relationships at play, including a young church member named Mary (Amanda Seyfried) who asks Rev. Toller to talk with her husband, a troubled man who is devastated by humanity's culpability and apathy towards climate change. The pastor of local mega-church Abundant Life (Cedric ""The Entertainer"" Kyles) also affects a friendship with Rev. Toller (""even a pastor needs a pastor""), but whether this connection is collegial, opportunistic, or domineering depends on the occasion, and may not have a single answer. The stark contrast between these two churches and their pastors cannot be overstated (It could also be a significant meta-reference that a man known publicly as ""The Entertainer"" who transacts his life with dual identities was cast as the pastor of Abundant Life, but never mind).The fine details of the film underscore its dynamic message of free will: the threadbare living quarters and dirty bathroom of poverty; the implicit symbolism of Toller raising up overturned headstones in the graveyard surrounding his church; his sudden reaction when yet another person tells him what he should do. Toller's life is miserable, but his perspective is insightful: ""Wisdom is holding two contradictory truths in mind, simultaneously: hope and despair. A life without despair is a life without hope. Holding these two ideas in our head is life itself.""First Reformed is remarkable because it demands that we navigate our relationship with God by means of our relationships with his creation. This doctrine is framed philosophically within the film by the repeated question ""Will God forgive us?"" But to call First Reformed a mere theological exercise undermines the powerful narrative and emotional resonance of the characters and plot.Much could be said of the cinematic devices at play within this film, whether or not particular sequences qualify as homage to other masters or stand on their own artistically-but to analyze these arguments here or upon your first viewing would do you a major disservice. It would be equally importune to lavish well-deserved praise upon Ethan Hawke's performance and Paul Schrader's writing/direction-although I must say this is by far the best film of either of their distinguished careers.When we struggle with the questions Toller suggests, not only does the film find its voice, we ourselves are changed on a personal level. ""Courage is the solution to despair,"" says Toller, ""reason provides no answers."" His quest is through the dark night of not only his own soul, but that of all humanity, and in the film's final shocking moments, I believe he discovers a truth that escapes the human demands of religion, reason, and despair to ascend to the heights of authentic faith, hope, and love.",First Reformed
166,dwolf77,Interesting,8,1 June 2018,"First Reformed is a very thought provoking and interesting film. Ethan Hawke stars as Reverend Toller, a heavy drinker who serves at the local church, ""First Reformed."" The church is 250 years old, and is known as the ""souvenier shop,"" because of its lack of attendees and many tourists. Ethan Hawke does a wonderful job playing a distraught reverend, plagued by the death of his son who joined the army as per his request. The film also starts Amanda Seyfried as the widow of Michael, a radical environmentalist. Her name is Mary, (no coincidence there), and Seyfried delivers a mixed performance, with some of her scenes standing out and others feeling awkward and out of place. The film is shot in the old-fashioned 1.67-1 aspect ratio, giving the viewer a box-like feeling of enclosure. The cinematography is imppecable, with the framing and shot composition adding to the already incredibly dark tone. The film shines in its techincal aspects, but lacks in other areas. There is no subtlely to be found here as the message of the film is very clear. Climate change is bad. While I don't necessarily disagree with the message at play here, the way it is brought up in the film is often overbearing and always out of place. This is clearly seen in a dream like sequence between Mary and the Reverend, that distracts the viewer because of how out of place and bizzare the sequence is. Ethan Hawke and others often bring up facts about climate change and its negative effect on the environment. Scenes are interrupted with quotes like ""97% of scientists believe there is climate change."" The message just feels very forced and out of place and I wish Schrader would have included the message in such a way that the characters spoke about it more from the heart, rather than reading notecards that contain facts. Overall, I would recommend this film for the wonderful cinemtography and filmmaking on display; but be cautious of the message, which often times gets in the way of what could've been a masterpiece. I still reccomend this film and encourage you to see it.",First Reformed

Meanwhile, a thought-provoking story unfolds with some of the best acting we've seen from each elite performer. The entire cast (from Hawke to Seyfried to Cedric Kyles) delivers fantastic performances that are essential in bringing the chilling messages of the film home.The story is expectedly spiritual and surprisingly political. The pace of the film is deliberate and switches seamlessly between snapshots and extended takes. The scoring slowly builds its ominous tone and the effects are tastefully done.

170,k_grall,"A lucid, illuminatory experience; and why struggle, and our cultural-Christianity, remain each compelling",9,18 October 2019,"Lucid; that's my keyword for this film. There are other very good reviews posted here by other IMDB reviewers, and I've pleasurably devoured several of them (particularly concerning the movie's end, with Hawke's actual drinking of the drano and accompanying hallucination of Seyfried's character; which I only faintly noted as unusual when I watched it, and didn't truly latch on that the scene was not to be read straight-ly - Bravo, in interpretation, thank you IMDB reviewers!). So, to find something I want to contribute: the film and its translucent, white and boxed presentation, adds to this very lucid quality. Lucid for Ethan Hawke's character and how he is, and presenting the film as such.Chris Nolan used light-whiteness in Insomnia, and First Reformed does so similarly, I feel. Both films interestingly involve searches for Truth; which may be coincidental but might also be conflated, without that connotation, as a state of lucidity? I find lucidity here, anyway. And the boxedness of non-widescreen presentation also talks to me about constraint, which again is a quality to the lucid state the Reverend is dealing with.The themes of struggle and a Christian framework of understanding situated in this time and place, are compelling. I will always be suckered in by such discussions, I think, and this is definitely in my oeuvre. I most enjoyed the discussion with the manager of the Church's affairs that strove to point out the Reverend should not feel and indulge in Christ's suffering as much as he does. And I savoured seeing the Reverend's sexuality emerging now and again, through - what I regard not as Priestly, but middle-class and cultivated, repression. Repression and feelings of sexuality, and what to do with them, that we all have (see Freud, Foucault, Shakespeare, etc.).The film starts with the Reverend's ambitious recording of his thoughts, and ends, apparently, in induced hallucination which the narrative plays straight.

It's almost like the filmmakers were so in love with the scenery, they forgot to tell a story.It is a drama, with nothing at all mysterious or thrilling in it, and so we have this slow-moving, predictable story with characters going nowhere. If the trailer had just been honest about this film being a drama, maybe I could have been more moved by the internal struggle of the main character.The saddest part of all this is that the film's commentary on religious life in America seems spot-on and interesting.

I would enjoy my flights of fancy but then, inevitably, arrive at the narrative's cliff edge. And at this point I would shamelessly resort to cliched plug-ins like ""it was all a dream"".
Well, Paul Schrader has done a grown-up version of this here..
He began writing a tight, bleak tale of the lost horizons of both the main characters and our contemporary capitalist culture. Then he clearly ran out of both intellectual and emotional juice and thus resorted to his plug-in.
And so it is that after about three quarters of the running time, he switches from prose to poetry and finally to ecstatic imagination. In brief, he bottles it and cocks up the ending with the most ludicrous, arbitrary and finally unjustified plot points.

It was a concept that had such potential, and I strongly suspect that it would be so much stronger as a novel, following Hawke's ""revelations"" and gradual ""conversion"" - much more of a psychological work than a film could do justice to. Sourcing the bible as a justification for opening up our eyes to help and save our magnificent planet, ourselves, and future generations is a first for me (how many people use it as an excuse to rape and plunder the planet??). But direction was incoherent, editing was choppy, Hawke was underutilized (he is a fine actor!), and ""tripping"" when one is 6-months pregnant and then wrapping a barbed-wire-encased chest around a pregnant woman (and her baby - and his blood didn't seep through with all that squishing?)?

And while he has continued to work, he has not made a movie outside of the shadows of the former two films. First Reformed might as well be that shot of acclaim. What Paul Schrader did is make a breathtaking examination of depression and salvation.The first thing that is striking is the atmosphere, creating an ambient tone of quiet and grey, symbolizing the state of mind of the main character. All of which matched by the amazing cinematography Alexander Dynan. The movie has a unique framing, being shot in 16:9, or fullscreen. I'm not sure why exactly, but Schrader made it works regardless. The acting is also great too, with Ethan Hawke giving what might be his best performance of his career, definitely worth an Oscar (or at least a nomination), with Amanda Seyfried and Cedric Kyles (a.k.a. Cedric the Entertainer) delivering some fantastic supporting roles.I feel like one of the most divisive aspects of the film is the reoccurring environmental messages. I will admit it can be preachy, however I don't really mind because the movie is more about depression and a deconstruction of salvation and God. It's brilliant with how Schrader uses God with the examination of hopelessness and the feeling of regret and betrayal in the backdrop of serious issues that really compliments what is going on. Also more of a nitpick but I wish the movie was entirely set in silence than having an ambient score that doesn't really show up a lot, but it did it's job well enough so I can't complain.Overall, First Reformed is a brilliant movie that is powerful in it's unsettling deconstruction of the Church.

Nevertheless, it was a well made movie and I really appreciate the director letting the actors tell the story rather than using special effects or endless camera moves that so many movies do nowadays.

187,nikosxen,Ethan Hawke's best Performance,6,25 November 2018,"Another mixed bag for me. I really wanted to like this movie. Ethan Hawke delivers his best performance yet, Amanda Seyfried is also very good, the whole tone of the movie is genuinely depressing and I really felt the depth of some of the dialogue between the characters. But in the end I felt disconnected by the means the director used in order to achieve his purpose. I felt like I was force fed all of his environmental concerns in a very direct way and this is something that always turns me off when I watch a movie. Of course it's fine when someone wants to have a political message in a movie, and the destruction of the environment is certainly a noble one, but I don't like it when movies portray such complex issues in such an absolute and simplistic way.I mean my biggest problem with the movie (SPOILERS) was the fact that Ethan Hawke's character eventually changed his world view because of an activist. I mean I get the allegory between hope and despair when it came to him and Mary and the contrast between his ""true"" belief and the commercial belief of the other pastor, both of these explain the crisis he finds himself into, and of course the fact that he discovers he is probably very sick.But to me, if drastic change didn't come from his sons lost in the war, when it comes to his belief and world view, I just doubt it that meeting an activist who is also clearly depressive is a strong motive for such a man to change.",First Reformed

189,GMAGIC2525,2018 Ripoff of Taxi Driver and Night Moves,1,1 February 2019,Did I watch a different movie from everyone else here? What is with all these good reviews? This movie is a blatant ripoff of Taxi Driver and Night Moves. Ethan Hawke's character is essentially Travis Bickle the Pastor in this movie. I have seen Taxi Driver and Night Moves already and I don't need to see it again. Amanda Seyfried and Cedric the Entertainer are miscast in this film and the ending is very cheesy to say the least. It is very hard to take Cedric the Entertainer seriously in a character driven drama. Let me say that again.....CEDRIC THE ENTERTAINER is in this movie. I was just waiting for Cedric to pick up a mic and start his standup comedy routine. This movie is supposed to be a thought-provoking religious thriller and the ending is boring and anticlimactic. I started this movie with high expectations and I left with utter disappointment. So take my advice and skip this movie because First Reformed is not worth your money and time.,First Reformed

When the pastor, ex-military man that he is, removes a cache of home-made bombs himself, rather than calling in the bomb squad, and we find later, removes them not to safe disposal, but under his own bed (!) - you know you are in silly la-la land.

A system so far reaching that it's as omnipresent as ""God"" himself. A reach that know no bounds, not even from our churches, especially the megachurches as shown in the film.Capitalism is itself a doctrine. A doctrine thats framework of draining resources from the masses of working people and from our planet itself, so that the few rich can have more, cannot be questioned. A doctrine that is quite literally the opposite of Jesus' teachings according to the Bible. But our entire economic system, and consequently our society and culture, exists within this framework. And from this discordant moral paradox attached to our society, we have the minister in First Reformed.It was a harrowing film. Frightening. Practically a horror. Despite it being a film based around faith, the ending is the only part of the film that presents any semblance of divinity acting out and giving meaning or hope to the characters. Many hated the ending, but I thought it was quite brilliant, and I was quite relieved.",First Reformed
193,gokul-stunninglyunique,Make no mistake this movie is anti Christianity - I'm Non Christian .,1,7 August 2021,"Don't fall to the line that its a character study on religion vs temptation of personal desire. Hollywood won't make a movie in which the priest does good deeds, but they will make one in which he slips. 'First reformed' as in Church should reform & turn into activists, like this guy pioneers? Select Scriptures are mentioned to justify why Church should be activists. The 'organ' joke in the first half which is offensive as it insists priests give into temptation is followed by insinuation that the joke is true. So they offend the Church & Church system throughout the movie but they also want them to turn activists & if they fall into line then they're ""reformed."" This movie is written with such hate & contempt. It drives them to show the Church in bad light. There's more activist propaganda here than Bible verses. Whatever Bible verses are there they were cherry picked to convince Church should turn activist. This movie is offensive & it's insidious. Don't give methe camera pan theory, I spotted it the moment I saw it too. But none of you avidly keen yes critics/reviewers are mentioning the scene in which the mind voice of Ethan Hawke, the priest is voiced by Cedric, the dead activist. I spotted it right off, why aren't the reviews that praise the camera pan & Last temptation reference (which was & is controversial) spot this subtle clue to show the change in mindset of the Reverend. Do not watch this movie unless you hate Christianity. If you love the world like I do watch Bat Geo, if you wanna solve the very real but over exaggerated (I don't think the world will end by 2050 I think it'll be untenable in some places basically it won't go kabloom one day, it'll harm is slowly & steadily like torture) climate change problem build solutions, innovate don't protest.

197,adam-m-fontenot,An astonishing film,10,7 June 2018,"I have to urge everyone I can to go see this movie while it's still in theaters. I have often wondered whether people who saw classics during their original releases recognized them in the moment; now I have to believe they do. Perhaps I'm mistaken - but I fully expect First Reformed to appear on many lists of greatest films in 30 years. Unfortunately it seems it will be tragically unappreciated until then.While viewers will no doubt recognize the references to other Schrader screenplays (Taxi Driver, The Last Temptation of Christ), and the strong thematic resemblance to the Ingmar Bergman film Winter Light, this extraordinary story of a minister in the grip of a divine darkness deserves to be appreciated before being compared.A tight script and gorgeously bleak cinematography allow Ethan Hawke to explode onto the screen in nearly every scene. While the entire film is a rare gift of near-perfect execution, Hawke in particular displays tremendous expressiveness in his portrayal of a mind's slow unraveling. Hawke's Toller establishes the key theme early in the film: we're told that we must hold onto both despair and hope simultaneously. Toller's efforts to live this paradox lead him down a path of madness. As Michael (played by Philip Ettinger) makes quite clear, once the idea that despair is realism has taken hold, attempting to continue to live with hope feels at best insincere, at worst hypocritical, and Toller begins to see both of these attitudes at work in his community. This realism structures much of the film (which is why the few moments it strays are so shocking), and necessitates Toller's downward spiral. At its worst, despair causes even genuine concern to appear to be insidious misdirection. What hope can one marry to this kind of despair? Only, Michael suggests, the hope of martyrdom. We discover that existential crises and sincere Christianity make quite the couple. Toller finds he must reject the cheerful face presented by contemporary Christianity, but as an alternative he can find only the Garden and the Cross. The careful logic of it draws us in; it's difficult to see where Toller goes wrong. Is there room for any real hope in this life? Can God forgive us, or must we find redemption ourselves? Toller, it seems, will be lucky to find the answers he seeks.",First Reformed

There are clearly companies looking to profit from governments that look the other way to engage in atrocious acts that will eventually rend our planet unlivable. Regardless, using 30 minutes of a motion picture to constantly beat us over the head with that message doesn't let me enjoy an otherwise excellent movie. I get it, climate change sucks, and we should be doinging more to prevent it, but don't let that agenda ruin the chance at acheiving visionary cinema. The movie could have been a clear cut front runner for film of the year, however the politics make it a muddled quagmire. Since this was clearly their intention, I dropped it from 8 stars to 6.Regardless, despite the ignorant pandering that ruins an otherwise fine film, I would wholly recommend this to anyone that enjoys those good, slow burns, with a cinematic footprint striving to emulate kubrick.

Of course in films based around religion, there are more questions and fewer answers ( if at all ). And that's fine. But the film bleeds confidence that we'll empathise with him and for him, no matter the path and the results of it.For starts, the film does start really strong, with the main character ( beautifully portrayed by Hawke ) willingly counsalting a young couple. The dialogue between the husband and the reverend is fascinating. It's unique in the sense that enviromental changes can have great effect on someone's religious beliefs, faith, hope for the future, etc. And that's the reverend's main conflict. ""Will God forgive us for what we done on this earth?"". That was the recent conflict/message in Arronofksy's Mother too.As for the final act, it can be more eyebrow raising than satisfying but this is the intend. It's not a political drama and never tries to beat you over the head with it's message. It's more character driven and that's why I found some actions and decisions, little strange, without him questioning the cost of his actions. He's a man of religion, he should have some doubts.",First Reformed

Jeffers likens extremists (intimating right wing, Bible believers) to jihadists. Additionally, the song chosen by Michael for the scattering of his ashes yells out loud Agenda 21.When Michael asks Pastor Toller ""Can God forgive us for what we've done to this world?""...a mantra repeated often, Ethan replies ""Who can know the mind of God?"" Whereas, the answer is a resounding yes. ""If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."" (1 John 1:9)""I know that nothing can change, and I know there is no hope."" Not only is Toller gravely I'll, but he flagellates himself with journal entries, and meditates on depressing words from Thomas Merton, a Roman Catholic monk. Martin Luther was also a monk and practiced self-flagellation until he came to the knowledge of the truth. He learned and believed that his comfort, hope, forgiveness of sins, and right standing with God lay in the truth that Jesus paid his debt in full.

Well, here it is Toller's (read Schrader's) imagination of a holy place. Even if you don't care about the environment, you must have someone you care for, and this is what this movie's about. Till some time ago, I had very little understanding for the environment activists. Especially for the ones which were labeled to behave like fanatics. I wanted my home, my city, and my country clean of course, but only for aesthetics's purposes. My mind has changed thankfully, but I still have a lot to learn and to reform. As the movie title, we all have to reform, even if it is too late. No matter what your religion is - the message is universal and applies to all types of human solidarity and coexistence. Conserving the planet, no matter how hard and big deprivations await, is the core to every struggle for being good. You want gender , racial, religious equality-then you first must have a place to live to fight the battle. This movie just couldn't do more justice to the cause of environmental preserving. I love how it calls for the religious leaders to step in, where the politic ones chose not to. How it throws light over the numerous establishments which still allow the presence and growth of criminal deviations of the corporations. Mindblowing dialogues (even if you are not religious or ecologist - you'll love them), excellent cinematography and superb acting, are just great addition to the wonderful script. It feels like european cinema. I just can't understand the bad reviews in this section. Please watch this film. I hope that it will inspire you to change, as it did for me, more than any documentary or news I've seen on this topic - which only an astonishing piece of art can achieve - that is, not only to entertain the viewer, but to make him or her contemplate on the subject, and want to make a change.",First Reformed

Finally, a mass public killing that serves a nobler purpose than ""because I hate minorities or was rejected by hot cheerleaders.""A disturbing but important masterpiece this would have been... With Schrader's original ending of suicide.Instead he listened to someone else and threw in a random scene preposterously suggesting it's all good if the sick old priest makes out erotically with a pretty young blonde. One, the ""random"" thing is too over done in our era. Its passed on to the graveyard of pseudo-intellectual 90s re-runs.Two, no one is ""redeemed"" by a mid-life crisis masturbation fantasy.Three, climate change isn't going to be solved by meaningless sex, jihad was a much more rational option.Four, even as a fantasy or vision it doesn't work because Draino is a hideously painful way to die, it's not morphine.

But the extreme measures Hawke eventually adopts to push this agenda, simply aren't believable from where he began at the start of the movie. In order for this to work, you'd either need incredibly tight pacing with a lot of back story and/or flashbacks, or to expand the movie to a 3 hour run-time (or make it a mini-series). As it stands, things happen way too quickly and with almost no explanation. It's hard to take the film seriously because of it, or root for Hawke at all.With a lot of films, I can understand the hype, and varying viewpoints. But for this, I really find myself stumped.

A shotgun blast to the head in response to a thwarted grand gesture reveals that this fellow victim was not obsessed with the state of the planet, but with ending his life - something his unsurprisingly composed partner knew well, and something which resonated strongly with our main character.It resonated strongly with him because the clarity of mind demonstrated in the recent suicide - the cathartic acceptance that life is not liveable - planted a nefarious seed which we see flower rapidly into a morbid series of events leading to a near identical fate; a similarly grand gesture thwarted by what love was left in him.The setting of the story is dense but the message we are ultimately left with is clear: a sick man finally finds his tragic cure.
...
I like this film because it is a simple story, and has a simple message. It is told - both visually and orally - from the perspective of a severely depressed person. Everyone or everything is toxic, meaningless or corrupted, with little to no exception.What made the film better were the obfuscations of Ernst's mental state by seemingly political causes, conveyed in his stream of consciousness. It is perhaps not until near the end of the story that we realise his environmental catastrophism is a red herring - an enabler - for the black despair that lies beneath. The newfound political cause breathes life into, and shapes, the question he has been experiencing since the death of his son: why bother?The fact that Ernst may have a terminal illness is succulent irony. He wanders the Earth in plain sight, manically sick with depression, yet completely unobserved by everyone, and somehow it is the mere possibility of a serious physical medical condition that captures the attention of those around him.A scene that I will not soon forget is when Ernst finds a rare moment of serenity in connecting with Mary, someone who he subconsciously knows to understand his despair because she has witnessed it before. But of course, because of his sickness, this moment is doomed to fail and it is not long before his floating dream becomes a toxic nightmare.When the possibility of happiness rears its head, the sickness shuts it down. Hope is a meaningless word.The similarities with Taxi Driver are palpable, which was of course written by Paul Schrader many years ago, and this film is likewise a masterclass in the art of portraying the mentally disturbed. It is an illustration of how these people live in and amongst us, undetected, neglected save for the precious but scarce and insufficient glimmers of hope that give them a morsel of understanding - ultimately the inevitable victims of themselves, when their demons can no longer be contained.",First Reformed

253,villanuevachristianrae-61358,First Reformed (2018) - A Study of a Pastor's Depression,6,14 August 2018,"The opening shot of the film will make you stay a bit longer, with it's vivid and bleak cinematography the film will hunt you and will creep to your skin until it reaches your fears and nightmares. A piece about the study of a pastor's depression on this crucial and not environmental friendly world we created today. Every frame in the film is great to look at it paints a beautiful, yet doomed sceneries. It opens up a character that we rarely talk or meet in real life which is the pastor. In this film we explore their own insight in this world.First Reformed is about a pastor of a small church in upstate New York who spirals out of control after a soul-shaking encounter with an unstable environmental activist and his pregnant wife. Her husband wants to kill their baby, because he doesn't want his child to experience the end of the world that is bound to happen because of climate change. His wife played by Amanda Seyfried asks help from Reverend Ernst Toller played by Ethan Hawke to cure her husband's depression, but as he goes deeper to the relationship of this couple his mind is getting eaten by their beliefs.The pacing of the film is the only thing I am concerned about because I did not like it for this kind of genre film which tells a hunting tale. It shows static shots which makes the film slow, and with the mix of its pacing it gets boring in the middle. I wish there's more intense editing moments like in the third act of the film. The cinematography is the best part of the film because it really paints the the whole feel of the church and its people. The use of silence and minimal sound scoring is great because it makes you immerse to the characters.There's no doubt that Ethan Hawke is the star of this film. He conveys the whole attitude of a pastor who is private and secretive in his nature. He gives a compelling performance with the character, he let's us in his mind. In the other hand, Amanda Seyfried is believable as a housewife, her star power did not shine on this film which is great because it is needed for her role as someone who is just a suburban housewife. She have complete control with her character.The film tackles a great issue about environment which asks the question are we doing anything to save this planet or we need a little more push or an unforgiving one to open our eyes.The film is flawed with its storytelling pacing, but the whole concept is well-thought of and the casting is on point.

What I want to talk about is the ending.So, SPOILERS:No, he doesn't go forward with the suicide bombing, which would have been a wonderfully dark, and explosive, finale for the slow burn of the rest of the film preceding it. But, also, I don't think he 'makes out with his girlfriend' as another reviewer put it. He wraps himself in barbed wire, an update on Christ's crown of thorns, and a well done visual, both graphic and slightly understated at the same time. And he pours that drano and then we get the 'Last Temptaion of Christ' moment. He DOES drink that drano and then in that moment of sacrificing himself-which will indeed be enough of a spectacle to draw public attention to the cause-he imagines (or is rewarded with the vision of) her coming to him. He imagines a happy ending and then he film cuts to black mid-scene because the drano has done its job. He has died. People will ask questions.

But if we died before asking God's forgiveness then it's upto God that either He gave punishment or forgiveness.

262,It_do_it_do,Classical and Haunting,9,2 November 2019,"'First Reformed' is not 'Dog Eat Dog'. The two are almost laughably different. In place of Dog's reckless stylism and (impetuous) experimentation, writer-director Paul Schrader has sired a quiet, introspective study of a man who is above all else; lost, in a world we unfortunately share with him.Ethan Hawke plays Reverend Ernst Toller of the usually scantly populated First Reformed church, a man dying in tandem with his earth, faced with an overwhelming spiritual crisis and a bleak outlook on the future, who begins to lose his faith. I say begins, by the time we meet Toller he's already lost a son and subsequently a marriage, and finds himself unable to pray. Instead, he documents his thoughts in a journal which he will destroy in one year. When a newly pregnant woman, Mary (milked for all the optimism her name and condition inspire, a counter to the starkly hopeless Hawk-character), asks him to speak to her radical-environmentalist husband Michael, who is concerned with bringing a new life into such a broken planet, Toller is pushed to confront his ills even more unswervingly.Hawke captures his character's weary-eyed uncertainty and despondency perfectly, serving to make the all too tangible Reverend always sympathetic as he slips closer and closer toward despair. Indeed, Schrader's most compelling work comes to fruition in flawed and fascinating characters, plagued by contradictions and conflict, no different here. As the film progressed, I found myself surprised by how far I went in agreeing with the by then clearly unstable Toller.Schrader sticks to a boxy 1.37:1 aspect ratio, filling it with intimate portraits and austere locals, emptied of colour, appropriately matching the film's bleak tone. The exception comes when Schrader undercuts a breathlessly intimate moment with an honestly goofy translation of said intimacy. It must be said he does coerce the viewer into a certain hypnotically desolate state before the sequence ends, although why he couldn't let his transcendental style lead the scene evades me. It's an attempt to elevate our emotional response to the scene through contrast with the discreet previous hour or so of film, but Tarkovsky it is not. The enigmatic final scene does the same job, to much greater returns.The best way to describe 'First Reformed' is as a spiritual meeting-point between Bergman's 'Winter Light' and the Schrader-penned 'Taxi Driver'. The plot largely resembles the Bergman, and the two share an exacting questioning of belief. Schrader acknowledges the 'Taxi Driver' connection a few times to my mind, in an uncomfortable close-up of a glass here or a blurry, street-light filled town drive there. In many ways Toller is a modern equivalent to Travis Bickle. Two men so lost in the horror of their time that they fall prey to the ego-centric belief that their self-sacrifice (among other actions) will change things. 'Taxi Driver' was written by Schrader honestly, with a concerned understanding born of his own anger. It's been over forty years. If anything, 'First Reformed' documents, in no uncertain terms, our modern crisis, spiritual, worldly and personal.",First Reformed

264,davegipson,If you've ever worked in a church...or maybe even just been in one...this falls apart,3,8 June 2018,"SPOILER: I realize some think this film is brilliant. I did love the cinamatography (although I got really tired of everything being colored slate-blue. OK, you're giving us a barren color palette to match the pastor's mental state, we get it already). But as a pastor who's spent about 30 years in full-time church work, I'm wondering when directors, even great artists like this one, will bother to bring in a religious consultant on the project that they'll listen to. Because if you've ever worked in a church, most any church, the movie looses credibility with you quickly.To be clear, I have no trouble theologically with the film. And although it has a hot button political issue, I don't have a problem with that. But the emotional detachment the director gives both church settings is laughable. If the Abundant Living Church were as Stepford-Wivian and glassy-eyed as the youth choir rehearsing in their auditorium, it would be the size of Ethan Hawke's church and not a megachurch. Even the bad megachurches at least know how to fake warmth and emotion. These guys would never make it to the size depicted in the film. And no one's youth ""choir"" has 5 kids in it. They's never sound as pitch perfect as that group did.And the youth choir sings at the husband's memorial service one of those songs a choir normally has sitting around ready to go for such a sudden event...A PROTEST SONG ABOUT TOXIC WASTE? SERIOUSLY? Is Al Gore the worship pastor at this church? Was that the big number they were working on for the next Sunday's service? Was this Greenpeace Baptist Church?Then there's the scene when Mary talks about how she used to lay on top of her husband and touch hands. In a tossed-off, non chalant way the pastor asks, ""Do you want me to do that?"" Because of course that's something pastors offer congregants every day in a counseling situation? No, if this was realistic at all, that would have been an awkward moment, at least for him. Even for a non-religious counselor, that would be a huge crossing of the line. And while he might choose to cross that line, it wouldn't be a casual moment. So there is no emotional truth to the scene...even though they end up doing the ""Whole New World"" thing from Aladdin, using the Pastor as a magic carpet ride. Let's see, what else...You spend thousands of dollars to repair a large pipe organ. You have a big ceremony for the church's 250th anniversary. So of course, you only play the two keyboard registers on the organ and completely ignore the bass foot pedals that would make it sound all majestic. Seriously, there's no little old lady alive (or dead) who would have played Onward Christian Soldiers as wimpy as that organist did. Could they have not hired a real organist to play it properly? And then the lady gets up and sings the Stepford Wife version of Leaning on the Everlasting Arms to kick off the service. Is this truly what the director thinks religious people are like? Does he really believe religion is so devoid of passion? Oh, then Mary comes back to the pastorium and kisses and hugs the pastor...who just happens to be wearing barbed wire under his robe...which doesn't even smart the least bit. Right.There and several other idiosyncrasies made the film actually a bit funny for me. My daughter, who's 25 and grew up in this pastor's home, snorted several times as well, simply because it was so incongruent. Again, I was not offended by the film. In fact, I think there was a much better film there underneath, one that would have dealt with the pastor's struggle with suffering and how God exists in a world filled with evil and corruption.I read one review saying this film was an indictment of megachurches. Please. If you want to really indict them, please give me a call. This was way too phony to hit home. While some churches have done some awful things, having them underwritten by evil corporations is not a usual scenario. I know of no churches that receive corporate funding. It simply doesn't work that way. And if Schrader had bothered asked anyone, they could have told him. The film did too much of what people say they don't like about pastors: it preaches endlessly. The pastor falling into the husband's obsession with environmentalist extremism made no sense emotionally. It simply felt like the director preaching to us. And preaching, I believe, is best reserved for a Sunday service ;0)",First Reformed

275,clarkcurtis3,understand the ending and you'll appreciate the film,9,5 August 2019,"The key to appreciating this film is in understanding the ending by...1) understanding the camera dynamics employed by the director2) understanding the parallels between First Reformed (written & directed by Paul Schrader) and The Last Temptation of Christ (written by Paul Schrader, directed by Martin Scorcese)
1) Camera Dynamics:The camera is always fixed (never pans, never focuses in or out) except on 2 occasionsOccasion #1: when Toller lays on top of Mary and they float through space. The camera moves & pans. This is a clue for the viewer... when the camera moves... it's a dream sequence.Occasion #2: during the last 90 seconds of the movie... the camera spins around Toller & Mary. This means it's a dream... not reality!
2) parallels between First Reformed (written & directed by Paul Schrader) and The Last Temptation of Christ (written by Paul Schrader, directed by Martin Scorcese)The Last Temptation of Christ received a lot of publicity (much of it negative) when it was released in 1988 because of the way many Christians (particularly more conservative & fundamentalist Christians) negatively responded to the scene depicting Jesus hanging on the cross, bleeding from the crown of thorns on his head and dreaming of what life would have been like if he had married Mary Magdalene and lived a normal life - worked as a carpenter, had kids, grew old, etc.In the last scene of First Reformed, Toller dons the barbed wire (similar to the crown of thorns) and DOES drink the drain cleaner. At which point, he goes into a dream state (similar to Jesus on the cross) in which he dreams of embracing Mary and living happily ever after with Mary (similar to Jesus dreaming of Mary Magdalene). The screen goes black and the movie ends because... the drain cleaner does it's job and he dies.Now that we have this understanding that Toller dies at the end... we have a whole new lens to use in determining what are the potential messages of the film.Could one of them be... extremism & martyrdom is no way to make a difference (to any cause - good or bad).",First Reformed

The film is full of profound thoughts, which are very true about the aim of institutions, their core purpose and the difficulty in having a wisdom capable of balancing and believing in the coexistence of opposing values, at the same time.

286,michaeldixon-56041,"A thoughtful, scathing critique of the modern American church",10,2 June 2018,"Https://dixonsbl0g.blogspot.com/2018/05/new-movie-review-first-reformed.htmlFirst Reformed is a thoughtful, scathing critique of the modern American church. As someone who has spent a significant portion of his life inside a church, this film deeply resonated with me. The church's blatant hypocrisy and inability to recognize its glaring flaws are major themes of this bold analysis of religious culture.Writer/director Paul Schrader (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull) tells the story of Reverend Ernst Toller (played magnificently by Ethan Hawke), a retired Army chaplain who has recently lost his son after convincing him to enlist. His wife leaves shortly thereafter, and Toller quits the army. Running from his guilt, he becomes the pastor of the historic First Reformed Church, which functions as more of a museum than a place of worship. Toller spends more time as a tour guide than a spiritual guide. First Reformed is owned by a nearby megachurch called Abundant Life, which uses the small, declining church as nothing more than a way to generate extra cash by selling souvenirs to passing tourists.One Sunday, a woman approaches Toller and asks him to speak with her husband, a troubled environmental activist consumed with despair over the earth's inevitable doom. Toller is sympathetic to the man's concerns but feels powerless to enact change. When he speaks to the pastor at Abundant Life (played by Cedric the Entertainer), his assumptions are confirmed. Despite Toller's assertions about climate science and the Biblical mandate to care for the earth, the pastor refuses to listen. Not only will the church fail to acknowledge the legitimacy of climate change, it will also continue to support powerful polluters in exchange for donations.Schrader exposes the flaws of most Protestant churches though his depiction of Abundant Life. One of these flaws is the inability to understand and empathize with differing viewpoints. There are hundreds, if not thousands of Protestant denominations in America today. If a churchgoer disagrees with the official church stance on even one point of doctrine, leadership typically responds by explaining that he is not allowed to state his rogue opinion to other members. If he doesn't like that restriction, he is free to leave.This ""my way or the highway"" attitude toward minor dogmatic issues has created an incredibly fragmented religion. Each individual church is filled with like-minded members who never encounter people with different perspectives. This atmosphere creates church members and church leaders who are incapable of intelligently debating complex issues. They believe what they believe because everyone around them believes it too. Alternate opinions seem ridiculous because they are not held within the church bubble.Additionally, the Protestant church has essentially become a propaganda arm of the Republican Party over the last fifty years. Corporations, politicians, and lobbyists make donations, and churches tell their congregations that Jesus wants them to vote Republican. The obvious contradictions between Jesus' teachings and the Republican goal of preserving the socioeconomic power of white men at the expense of other demographic groups are mostly imperceptible to church members because everyone around them believes that Christians have to be Republican.These two huge problems at Abundant Life create a hostile environment for Toller and his liberal concerns. Cinematographer Alexander Dynan uses a 4:3 aspect ratio and stationary camera shots to create the feeling that the viewer is peeking through a window into Toller's psyche. As he struggles to find anyone at the church with whom he can relate, he falls deeper into the depression and loneliness already present from his son's tragic death.A church is a lonely place for someone looking to enact change. Anyone who may have shared Toller's beliefs has either moved to a different church or, more likely, left the church altogether. Toller feels like the only sane person in the congregation - the only one who can see the cliff over which the blind pastors are leading their sheep.There is an eery lack of music throughout most of the film, building a suspenseful dread as Toller sinks deeper into his own mind. His unfurnished house seems to be the physical manifestation of Toller's mental state. His only furniture in the decently sized home consists of a twin bed, a table and a chair or two. Whiskey appears to be the only thing stocked in the kitchen, and he partakes at every opportunity. He is completely unprepared to host any guests, as if he is actively discouraging others from interacting with him. The only activity he engages in while at home is writing down his thoughts in his journal. Unable or unwilling to find anyone with whom to discuss his concerns, he is forced to mull over them obsessively.As the film progresses, Toller becomes less and less hopeful that the church is capable of change. He is forced to confront his faith and determine how his disagreement and frustration with the church will affect the path of his life.Schrader's portrayal of the church is bleak and fatalistic, but it is largely accurate. His impeccable filmmaking sheds light on systemic problems that must be addressed. I hope the film inspires some within the church to take action and fight to realign the institution with Jesus' teachings. However, it is much more likely that the film's message falls on the same deaf ears that are incapable of hearing Toller's cries for help.",First Reformed

WHAT follows is not a review as much as an opinion. First, Cedric is great! 
I was expecting a great collaboration between Schrader and Hawke, especially after hearing their interview with NPR's Terry Gross. I was disappointed. The special effects scene should have been cut; but then it was a shortcut to a character development scenario. The entire movie in fact is not well-formed; it lacks the structure-content proportion of a solid story. If there is ""message"" in the movie (like Demi Moore in ""Striptease"") it is this: the churches have no business in societal issues. What: providing an earthly conduit, through worship, to God is not enough!? If I ruled the world, tax-free churches would be banned from work that can be better adjudicated by politics - local and national governments, research facilities, non-profits, et. al.. When it comes to organized religion, I am an originalist. If we cannot fall back on prayer and worship to connect us to birth and childhood.... But that ship has sailed.

I'll applaud a good film whether I hold the beliefs of the maker(s). I think in bullet points so here are my views on the Pros & Cons.
Pros
Solid framing, shots, & set design. From the initial shot of the church to the biking scene, to his minimalist furnishings, to the emptiness of the mega-church, I felt like everything visually (barring sfx) was solid & beautifulPremise is promisingCons
Incongruity between reverend's journey and supporting plot: The leaps the main character makes in the movie are at odds with the presented plot and character background. I think it is a disservice to those vulnerable to fanatical extremism to represent such an easy and shallow transition into said self annihilation & willingness to destroy others. This is a topic still under examination (NY Times 5/31/18), but this film would suggest that a reasonable model for creating a fanatic is to create a 46 year old, white divorcee who lost a child, attended seminary, runs a small church, & suspect he may have cancer. Add one counseling session with a young, environmental fanatic and boom: suicide bomber. Is this a remotely probable demographic?Thrown away opportunities: the underground railroad tie in and ""gift shop church"" as presented were appendages that missed strong opportunities drive the storyShallow spiritual platitudes: This film is reviewed by some as a spiritual / Christian engagement into responsibility for how we treat the earth. There is some support here, but the actual intellectual engagement at a theological level (supposedly this character's driving mentality) are a few obvious scripture quotes and brief exchanges. I have engaged in far deeper conversations with environmental activists on Christian under-pinning for their beliefs than this film even considers. It isn't of substance.Corporate blame: The story takes a cliche view of the blame by pointing to corporations and the rich exploiting the environment & maneuvering the government officials. This is part of the story, but it is convenient when I can leave a theater on the global consequences of climate change and not feel an iota of responsibility or need to change. Thank you, for the pat on the back and reinforcement of smug slactivism.Hawke's portrayal: he nailed the glassy-eyed, soulless addict. Unfortunately, the character needed to be so much more than this to pull such grand issues together.Conclusion:
Based on the narrative, I'm forced into a few possible explanations for the character's development:
1. Anomalous psychotic break not shown on film
2. Months to years of backstory (this story covers about 8 weeks) left out to explain character's need to grab on to this fanaticism as a logical consequence of his mental state & surroundings.
3. The reverend is a dehumanized object created by writer/director as a Christ figure to suffer for the muddled attempt to tie spirituality, corporate responsibility, social apathy, and environmentalism into a cohesive whole.
I'm leaning toward the latter.

I expected so much more from this film!,2,23 June 2018,"Having seen the film last evening after reading many positive reviews, I am dumbfounded by the praise being heaped upon this very imperfect effort. As a Presbyterian (""Reformed"") minister myself, I am accustomed to being disappointed at the unrealistic way clergy are portrayed in films. Sadly, this film did no better. Trust me, no 42-year-old seminary-educated clergyperson would speak the way Ethan Hawke speaks in this film. His character sounds like something out of the 19th century, with no awareness of contemporary bible translations, gender inclusive language, or healthy boundaries training. The writer seems to have been totally unaware of the polity (form of government) of reformed churches, and the connectional support systems that are in place to care for troubled clergy. Schrader's depiction of church life abounds in stereotypes and cliches. The hymns used throughout the film are dusty old relics of generations past. The theological dialogue is superficial at best (clearly those who think it's ""deep"" and ""intellectual"" have never read a theology book or heard a real theologian speak). The film's message of environmental destruction is delivered with a sledgehammer, as if the audience were too stupid to understand subtlety or nuance. The extremes to which the main character descends are shocking, because they do not seem warranted by his circumstances, nor consistent with his character.The film is so bleak and depressing, one hopes at least for some kind of redemption at the end.

322,mrls-05315,First Reformed,10,17 January 2021,"I couldn't help comparing this movie to ""Winter Light"" for most of the time I was watching it. ""Winter Light"" is one of my favourite films.
There's no denying the similarities: the priest struggling with his faith, the suicidal man worried about the problems of the contemporary world, the woman who is in love with the priest and who is constantly rejected, the small church, winter, snow and so it goes.
But that's all in the surface, because after a while it's clear that they are different films and their main characters are the main reason for that.
Pastor Tomas, the main character in Bergman's ""Winter Light"", is a defeated man. He believes that, if God exists, He abandoned him. And that's why he can't save Jonas, the suicidal man who seeks for Tomas' guidance when worried a nuclear war could happen. Tomas lost his wife, but he doesn't seek someone else to be on his side. Tomas has no will, he lives life as an obligation and his ministry as an ordinary job, not a vocation.
Reverend Toller also has his doubts about God, but he tries to communicate, even if he gets no answer. He tries to help Michael, the suicidal man whose wife seeks Toller's guidance when her husband is worried about the future of the planet due to the constant destruction of the environment. He seeks love again after being left for his wife.
Toller, differently from Tomas, acts. He questions people around him, he tries to act like Jesus would if He was here right now.

Cap it all off with false gospel, including I believe deliberate misquoting of the Bible (Ephesians 6:12), and do you have an absolutely abysmal movie, a complete waste of 120 minutes.

I can not remember the last time I was this strucked by a film. Have I ever been? The acting, the script, the photo, the camerawork. Words not enough. Some critics said this might be a ""career defining moment"" for Schrader and I think they may be right. No doubt it's a beautiful homage to directors like Bergman, Tarkovski and Bresson; it's also a masterly performed incarnation of Schraders own concept of the ""Transcendental style"".",First Reformed

Still less noticed, so far as I can tell, is the significance of the central character's name--Ernst Toller. A not very well remembered figure today in German literary (and, in a way, political) history, even by many of those with some familiarity with the field, but clearly not a name chosen by Schrader at random. Worth looking up.",First Reformed
340,luciduscolors,This exists and it makes me sad,1,22 July 2018,"Wow. If I could give this piece of crap 0/10 stars, I would.(SPOILER ALERT)
I just got back from viewing what is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. Don't waste your time with this, because believe me, it WILL waste your time. The shots in this movie are long and meaningless. They will focus on something insignificant for LONG periods of time to the point where it makes gouging your eyes out sound like a good idea. I have never fallen asleep during any movies. I have walked out, but the tickets for this were outrageous, and I didn't want to waste money. God, I wish I had. The movie went nowhere quickly, and I ended up falling asleep three times. The plot was barely focused on. It was thin and watery and all over the place. Viewpoints were contradictory. The message, unclear. Am I supposed to vote for suicide bombers? Oh wait, killing yourself is bad. But wait, according to Reverend Toller, it's a holy act? Wait, is life worth living for? Is this an anti-suicide movie? An environmental movie? A radical movie? An anti-radical movie? WHO AM I SUPPOSED TO VOTE FOR? And don't worry about missing a thing in these characters' lives! You get to see ALL of it. Pissing? Check. Standing there in silence? Check. An alarm clock that doesn't go off but will remain in the shot for 15 full seconds? CHECK (not kidding about this one). People laying on top of each other for a full 40 seconds in complete and utter silence? ...um...yep. And that's where the weirdest scene in the whole movie happened. Reverend Toller and some pregnant girl lay on each other and have an acid trip with some of the worst CGI possible. It looks ridiculous. Why did it happen? I dunno. What's happening? I really don't know. What I do know is that I want to cut my leg off with a spoon. This movie is full of unneeded shots, silence, a stupid plot, an unclear message, and boring conversations. For a (possible) anti-suicide movie, it makes one want to commit suicide. By the end, I WANTED Toller to kill himself. I wanted the stupid bombs to go off and have him die. I'm supposed to vote for this guy, but my brain is leaking out my ears from the sheer boredom, and I was dying for an explosion to take him out and end it already.

This is why when you see his back you can't see the outline of the barbed wire or any blood and Mary doesn't hurt herself when she hugs him because there is no barbed wire in his dying vision.
It would have been more effective if when he walked to her, his white robe didn't have any blood stains on the front of it. That would have been another clue. It was too vague. I didn't get it at first either.",First Reformed

348,asiira,A Critique of Man,7,25 November 2018,"First Reformed is a movie about religion. It is about big business and the environmental destruction of which they are to blame. It is about a willingness of the Church to turn a blind eye in the face of sin. It is about love. It is about hope. But these subjects fall away as Paul Schrader tightens his focus onto a detached pastor. An unnerving and bleak look into the despair that can envelope the most faithful or the most hopeful, Ethan Hawke's brutally honest presentation of an unsure and resentful man along with foreboding gray scaled cinematography leaves the audience asking: But what of man? What of this broken man in particular? Why does man fear their own destruction so greatly that they are willing to end their life before that destruction could take them? Paul Schrader's newest film may be shrouded in politics, religion, or the philosophy of love, faith, or hope, but behind the obvious horror lies the subconscious dread. Not the existential dread of living in an imperfect and devastating world, but the fear of how oneself will react to the overwhelming despair of a reality with little hope.",First Reformed

The scattershot approach in storyline suggests that perhaps there were three movies that wanted to be made.

The hard cut to black also supports this.",First Reformed
