0,TheLittleSongbird,Stylish and entertaining with a good cast if majorly problematic,6,22 March 2015,"Despite the very mixed opinions on Fracture the casting was very promising, which was reason enough to check it out. After watching, Fracture had a lot to recommend but didn't fully live up to its potential.Fracture does have a lot of good qualities or so I thought. It's very stylishly filmed with some unusual but well-done camera angles and eye popping colours. The music score is suitably understated and suspenseful, the script is clever and sharp with some intelligent dialogue in the courtroom scenes and the story has its diverting parts with the courtroom drama entertaining and suspenseful and the twist is interesting. It's well directed and the cast were great and lived up to their potential. Anthony Hopkins' accent is inconsistent but he's still chillingly commanding and Ryan Gosling is equally very good in a very polar opposite role. Their cat and mouse chemistry provide a lot of the film's entertainment. Embeth Davidtz, Billy Burke and David Strathiarn acquit themselves very well too and Fiona Shaw stands out as a sharp-tongued, dry-witted judge.Wasn't crazy about Rosamund Pike here, she looks great and is a talented actress with a number of good performances under her belt, but while she makes a real effort to give off a cool-as-ice authority I found her character to be pointless and very indecisively written. The story has its fair share of good parts but it is also majorly flawed, it does get complicated and ridiculously preposterous complete with a thrown-in and unnecessary romantic subplot and an ending that has too many loose ends. The pacing can be absorbing but can have a tendency to drag and unfortunately when it does it does so badly. Overall, entertaining and well-made with a good cast who give impressive performances but very problematic in the story department, which is a shame. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Fracture
1,bkoganbing,Hopkins And Gosling Holding Up A Weak Story,5,24 April 2007,"I will always try to see anything with Sir Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling in it, their names at the top of the billing for Fractured guaranteed me plunking down ticket money. Although in this case I used an earned pass at the Regal Cinema.I did enjoy the playing of both of these guys in a very improbable tale of a man who kills his wife and then is arrested for the murder in what seems an open and shut case.And for the audience it is open and shut because we know right at the beginning Hopkins did it. The story is how he manipulates the system and the people working in it for his own ends.Hopkins's wife is having an affair with homicide detective Billy Burke and we know that also right at the beginning. Unfortunately the problem in this film is that the plot is predicated on Hopkins KNOWING that Billy Burke will be the investigating detective on the scene when the crime is called in. Still Hopkins and Ryan Gosling as the preoccupied District Attorney who is looking to make a career move and not giving the Hopkins case the attention it deserves turn in a pair of fine performances. My favorite in the film however is Billy Burke as the tragic detective in the story.Recommended for fans of Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling.",Fracture
2,SnoopyStyle,Gosling Hopkins faceoff,7,6 October 2013,"Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling) is a slick prosecutor on his way out to bigger and better things in the private sector. For his last case, brilliant wealthy Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) has killed his wife. He seems to be unbalanced as he demands to represent himself. It looks to be an open and shut case. That is until the gun they got isn't actually the murder weapon, and worst of all, the arresting officer was having an affair with the wife.Ryan Gosling is effective as a slick young gun who got caught with his pants down. Anthony Hopkins is doing a variation of Hannibal Lecture. He's less cannibal but all the same just as smart. It's nice to see them face off. Some of the actors overplay their roles especially detective Flores (Cliff Curtis). While I get why everybody has to be against Willy, it does make it seem oversimplified.",Fracture
3,Hitchcoc,Will We Ever Get to the Point?,7,25 March 2010,"This film has all the elements to make it great. Anything with Anthony Hopkins at his quirky best is immediately attractive. He kills his wife and then challenges the young lawyer to do something about it. Of course, he has hidden evidence and is messing with the mind of the young prosecutor. Shades of Hannibal Lector. This works pretty well for the most part. There are some real problems. I'm not going to throw in any spoilers, but when you go back over the events when the police first arrive, imagine on what a delicate thread Hopkins' character is treading. That's all I'll say. The other thing that I have trouble with is that while there is an epiphany, it isn't presented in the methodical, thoughtful way that more successful films present such things. Also, everything grinds to a halt for an interminable period. We need a little success and a little desperation from the bad guy. It just didn't fulfill it's promise at the beginning, a common weakness in contemporary psychological thrillers.",Fracture
4,Prismark10,Cracks in the case,6,5 July 2014,"A cat and mouse thriller with sumptuous LA shots and nice cinematography Fracture is a flawed but elaborate film.Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) a talented, wealthy aeronautical engineer who shoots his much younger wife who is having an affair with a cop. He manages to get the cop on to the crime scene and discover her body, confesses and then represents himself at court.Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling) is the hot shot assistant DA just about to enter better things in private practice tasked to convict him and maybe takes the case a bit too easy, after all he has a written confession.Crawford prides himself in finding people's flaws, weak pressure points. Beachum soon realises that he has been played by Crawford, his new job is at risk and the DA office wants to get rid off him. They cannot find the murder weapon and the cop who arrested him on the scene is compromised because he was having an affair with Crawford's wife. Crawford has made a monkey out of the justice system and has no case to answer, but Beachum is determined to get him and as Crawford plans to pull the plug on his wife's life support, he might get another chance.The film is carried by Gosling and Hopkins goading each other but it depends on a lot of contrivances that makes Crawford being uber clever as to how police procedure and the justice system works. If you do not buy that then the film looks far fetched and even silly.There is a lame romantic subplot featuring Gosling and Rosamund Pike but the latter part is thrilling as Beachum sets out to get his man.",Fracture
5,claudio_carvalho,"Excellent Film of Crime, Mystery and Trial",8,5 July 2011,"In Los Angeles, the structural engineer Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) witnesses his wife Jennifer Crawford (Embeth Davidtz) and her lover Lieutenant Robert 'Rob' Nunally (Billy Burke) in the swimming pool of a hotel. When Jennifer comes back home, he shoots her on the head and then he shoots three times against the windows. The gardener Ciro (Carlos Cervantes) calls the police and the negotiator Rob, who does not know the last name of his lover, gets the murder weapon and a confession from Ted.Meanwhile, the young and efficient but arrogant prosecutor Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling) is resigning his position in the low-pay public service work to join the private civil-law firm Wooton Sims but decides to accept the case, which is his assessment is easily resolved. Ted asks the judge to represent himself in court and Willy accepts. But sooner the winner Willy learns that the evidences can not be accepted in the trial and despite knowing that Ted is the killer, the murder weapon is missing and he needs to get new evidences otherwise he will lose the case and Ted will be a free man.I bought ""Fracture"" on DVD a couple of years ago and I did not see this film until yesterday: my bad. This gripping film of crime, mystery and trial is great and as written by another IMDb User, ""keeps the viewer glued to the seat"". The duel between Anthony Hopkins, in one of his best recent works in the role of a manipulative and cold blood killer, and Ryan Gosling, in the role of an ambitious but human lawyer, is excellent.Films of trial are usually attractive, at least for me. And ""Fracture"" never disappoints and the surprising plot point in the end is fantastic. Last but not the least, I regret that I did not associate the name of Gregory Hoblit to the also magnificent ""Primal Fear"", ""Hart's War"", ""Frequency"" and ""Fallen"". My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Um Crime de Mestre"" (""A Crime of Master"")",Fracture
6,kosmasp,Perfect Plan,9,14 September 2021,"Every perfect plan has at least one flaw. On the other hand, if that plan is made by Anthony Hopkins ... a character played by him that is ... is there a chance to find and exploit that flaw? It had been a long time since I last saw this, so I didn't remember much ... I was surprised how tension filled and edge of the seat thriller this was.It really worked and apart from Hopkins we have Gosling ... another great actor, who is needed as counter to Hopkins. Still I do not blame anyone who has ... sympathy for the devil (no literally, I do think that most do realize this is just a movie). Depending on how much moral ambiguity you allow yourself, you will torn apart more or less while rooting for certain things to happen ... this is really well thought off and executed. And it is quite mean to put the audience through what they have to go through ... but as life the movie is also quite powerful ... can you dig it? And pay attention to the details ... yes twists are coming from left and right ...",Fracture
7,lee_eisenberg,Why do they so often show it raining in LA?,7,19 August 2007,"It seems like many of Anthony Hopkins's roles have mirrored Hannibal Lecter a little too much. While his role in ""Fractured"" is similar, it never veers too far in that direction to make the movie boring or stupid. As it is, they set the movie up so that you first assume that the movie will go in one direction, but then they trick you...and then there's more.Hopkins plays Ted Crawford, who catches his wife (Embeth Davidtz) having an affair with a detective. Rather than confront her about it, he waits until she arrives home and casually shoots her in the face, leaving her in a coma. When the police arrive, Ted confesses to the crime. But when it comes time for the trial - complete with hotshot young attorney Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling) prosecuting - the police can't produce a murder weapon. But it's through the result of this that we begin to learn more about both Ted and Willy...and how they can use it against each other.It's true that the basic idea is something that we see every once in a while, the movie plays with the audience. You're never really sure whether you want to root for Ted or Willy, as it seems like there are cases for and against both. So while this is by no means a masterpiece, this one is worth seeing, if only once. Also starring Rosamund Pike, David Strathairn and Cliff Curtis.The whole thing about showing rain in LA, it's probably just wishful thinking. As someone who's lived his whole life in Portland, Oregon, I know rain.",Fracture
8,jboothmillard,Fracture,4,7 July 2013,"I knew the two leading actors of this film, and that it would involve some investigative or mystery element, but apart from that I was certainly intrigued to see it, from director Gregory Hoblit (Frequency, Hart's War, Untraceable). Basically in Los Angeles, wealthy structural engineer Ted Crawford (Sir Anthony Hopkins) sees his wife Jennifer (Embeth Davidtz) having an affair with her lover in a hotel swimming pool, so in vengeance when she returns home he takes his gun and shoots wounding her, and he is taken away by the police. He immediately confesses to the crime, and signs a confession, but then he is pleading not guilty and demands to go to trial as soon as possible, and he asks to represent himself instead of a lawyer. Young and efficient but arrogant hotshot Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling) is the prosecutor in the case, and planning to leave the resign his position in the law firm he along with everyone sees the case and very open and shut. But it becomes obvious to Willy that Ted is playing a very dangerous game, as despite it being obvious he is indeed guilty the trial cannot go ahead as the murder weapon has gone missing, and the man having an affair with Jennifer was having an affair with is a police officer, Lt. Robert 'Rob' Nunally (Twilight's Billy Burke). Crawford and Beachum have a few confrontations in and out of jail and elsewhere, and even though the court trial does not go his way, due to the double jeopardy clause and other components, Beachum insists he can bring a new case for murder, Jennifer is taken off life support due to the bullet lodged in her head being inoperable, Crawford is in the end arrested and the new trial begins. Also starring David Strathairn as DA Joe Lobruto, Die Another Day's Rosamund Pike as Nikki Gardner, Die Hard 4.0's Cliff Curtis as Detective Flores, Bob Gunton as Judge Gardner, Xander Berkeley as Judge Moran and Harry Potter's Fiona Shaw as Judge Robinson. Hopkins is relatively good being the unpredictable villain, but he cannot recreate Hannibal again, or completely stick to his Irish accent, and Gosling is okay being the lawyer pitting his wits against the antagonist, I agree with critics this story is nothing original, some of the cat and mouse stuff was good to watch, but overall it didn't engage me as much as it could of, but it is an alright crime thriller. Okay!",Fracture
9,ccthemovieman-1,"Classy, Entertaining Battle-Of-Wits Film",10,15 August 2007,"If you like courtroom dramas, appreciate excellent acting and an expertly-filmed movie this is for you. Only once, I think, have I ever proclaimed something ""best movie of the year"" and all that, because it's all too subjective and also a cliché but that's how I feel about this movie unless something better comes along the last few months of 2007.This is just a fabulous movie with Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling playing battling characters who engage in a battle of wits. Hopkins plays a husband who discovers his wife having an affair, shoots her, confesses the same night and then has things cleverly arranged where it's almost impossible to convict him. Gosling plays a young, hotshot prosecuting attorney on his way to bigger and better things with a change of scenery to corporate law but gets stuck with this open-and-shut case right before he switches firms. The trouble is, it's a lot more than he figured and he isn't used to losing. Hopkins knows this, of course, and plays on his vanity. Gosling evolves from a me-only lawyer to someone who really wants justice, even if it costs him. Both characters are cocky and smart and the twists and turns just add to the fun.I enjoyed watching all the actors performances and was very impressed. The camera-work by Director Of Photography Kramer Morgenthau should also be recognized, along with director Gregory Hoblit, who seems to direct very entertaining films (""Frequency,"" ""Fallen,"" etc.) I could have watched this story unfold for another two hours and would have been happy to do so, am I'm not one to sit still for long periods these days. That's how good this was....just Grade A film-making and storytelling.",Fracture
10,rmax304823,Tricky Mystery,7,15 September 2008,"Nicely done, stylish puzzler about a man who murders his wife. Anthony Hopkins discovers that his wife, Embeth Davidtz, is having one of those anonymous affairs with Billy Burke, who happens to be a detective in LA homicide. One night she comes home from an assignation and Hopkins coolly shoots her in the head. The shot is heard and the police surround the house, led by Burke himself. Hopkins eventually allows Burke to enter the house alone, with the proviso that he lay down his gun, just as Hopkins will put down the pistol he's holding in his hand.Not knowing that Hopkins is his lover's husband, Burke asks, ""Is your wife alright?"", asks Burke. ""I don't think so,"" replies Hopkins, ""I just shot her in the head."" Burke sees the comatose body of Davidtz and, bang, runs to her and tries to revive her, taking his eyes off Hopkins for a few critical moments.It seems that Hopkins' goose is cooked, doesn't it? He's confessed that he's shot his wife. His gun is found. The barely alive body is lying there. No one has entered or left the house since the shot was heard.The case looks like a no-brainer, so it's given to Ryan Gosling in the Tom Cruise role of a cocky young lawyer who is just about to leave the DA's office for greener pastures. But, lo! Hopkins' confiscated gun is not the murder weapon! It can't be, because it's never been fired.Hopkins represents himself at the trial and -- smart as a whip -- he gets the charge of attempted murder dropped because of the absence of physical evidence. Not only that. Billy Burke has been sitting through the trial and when the case is dismissed he shoots himself. Then, twitting Gosling, whose number he's got, Hopkins whispers confidentially that as a final gesture he's going to pull the plug on Embeth Davidtz. Despite his rushing to the hospital with a court order, Gosling is unable to prevent the final insult. They pull the plug and she flatlines.Medical discretion forbids further plot revelations.Hopkins is good to great, as usual. He's getting older though and although this role suits him well enough, romantic leads will soon be behind him. Billy Burke is stolid as the lover. I can't say I've ever found Ryan Gosling less than irritating. He projects cockiness and self satisfaction but his range seems limited. He's less believable, far less, when he's been deflated. He may be a nice guy in real life -- loves his dog and collects stamps, for all I know -- but he always reminds me of the high school jock who never lacks for female friendship and acts out his advantage over the rest of us no-more-than-ordinarily handsome kids. Too many smirks and not enough self doubt.The plot itself has some holes in it, some of them sizable enough to drive a Ford Navigator through. Hopkins really has brains. He's built this elaborate device or game out of channels of tubing that you can roll ball bearings down and it takes five minutes of capering before the steel balls reach the bottom. They practically do entre chats. This device I take to be a symbol for the way Hopkins' mind works. And a good one because, after all, a legal autodidact, he becomes an Allan Dershowitz almost overnight in the court room. Yet he makes a thoughtless and pointless move at the end that brings about his own ruin. He spills the balls all over the floor.And I'm getting tired of looking at dark blue images on the screen. My eyeballs are about to go into shock at the sight of a hot pink object. Why is everything so dark, so gloomy? Why is the court room itself so dark? And a hospital? I'm hoping photographers will rediscover the visible spectrum.Not to say this isn't a film worth catching. It's nicely written and classically staged. No directorial furor. No cinematic fireworks. No car chases. It reminds me a bit of Hitchcock's ""Dial M for Murder,"" based on Frederick Knott's play. Except that Hitchcock's murder thriller wasn't nearly so dark.",Fracture
11,moonspinner55,"Probing Anthony Hopkins' mind (again) ... sleek production, dumbed-down results",4,17 November 2009,"Aeronautics engineer has apparently shot his wife in the head and barricaded himself in his sumptuous estate--yet once the emotional police lieutenant gets him out, nobody can find the gun used in the crime. ""Fracture"" is all fired up with the law and justice and ethics and obsession, however it forgets to incorporate characters who might just think and act like regular human beings; it is also flooded with red herrings and irritating performances. Ryan Gosling, talking with a guttural drawl, is the 'arrogant' young lawyer (called that in the film, I assume, because he's cool-headed and drives a nice car) who is promoted to the Los Angeles District Attorney's office to prosecute Anthony Hopkins, talking with an Irish burr. Hopkins appears to know certain things about his opponents as if he's been wired by the F.B.I. He also calls his office (from jail!) while Gosling is visiting to answer a question Ryan had just brought up to Hopkins' secretary. Screenwriters Daniel Pyne and Glenn Gers don't seem to know much about how a courtroom operates...and they know even less about how people normally operate. From the court judge to Gosling's sexually indiscriminate boss to the police investigator, everyone acts ignorant or helpless in order to propel this plot.

I'm not talking about the atmosphere, which yes, was dark, but most of this film was done in darkness.Nevertheless, it is a very effective modern noir. Hopkins plays a man who knows his wife is cheating on him and kills her. Then he confesses.

Desperate, Willy begs his boss (Strathairn) to see it through.Great story, very clever, with Hopkins and Gosling playing an effective cat and mouse game throughout. I'd hate to have to act opposite Anthony Hopkins unless my name was Emma Thompson, but Hopkins underplays this beautifully, and he and Gosling make a very effective team. With both men, it's almost as if one can read his thoughts as Hopkins gives a half smile and Gosling stares and sets his jaw.Though this story is about the conflict between two massive egos who always win, the underlying mystery is excellent as well.If you like this kind of film, and I do, don't miss this one.",Fracture

He is supposed to be a hot-shot lawyer on the verge of landing a big position at a law firm.

It tells the story of a man who shoots his unfaithful wife and a young prosecutor trying to prevent him from manipulating the justice system to get away with the crime.It was directed by Gregory Hoblit from a screenplay by Glenn Gers and Daniel Pyne.Ted Crawford is an engineer who lives with his wife, Jennifer in the couple's lavish Southern California home. One day, after carefully planning out the details to ensure that there is no way he can be convicted of murder, he shoots his wife in a blatant attempt to kill the woman. When head hostage negotiator Rob Nunally arrives on the scene to speak with Ted,he is shocked to find that the victim of the shooting is in fact his longtime lover. Though Jennifer survives the trauma of being shot in the head at close range, she hovers comatose between life and death as star prosecutor Willy Beachum reluctantly accepts the case while preparing to leave the Los Angeles criminal court system behind for a more promising career at a posh private law firm. Though the District Attorney vehemently resents Beachum's lofty plan for departure, the hotshot young lawyer remains convinced that he can expedite the apparently open-and-shut case and be on his way to greener pastures in one week's time at the very most. Beachum's swelling ego betrays him, however, as his future boss Nikki Gardner begins to turn up the heat and fracture mechanics specialist Ted chooses to represent himself at the trial knowing well that a career spent spotting structural flaws in aeronautical systems has instilled him with just the kind of argumentative skills needed to riddle the swaggering young lawyer's ""foolproof"" case with doubt.A smart and snappy thriller that makes light work of its ethical dilemmas, it is a little too neat and tidy to stick in the mind for long, but the Hopkins-Gosling pairing is choice, and neither comes up short.

Mr. Hoblit's direction keep the movie going at a good pace, although the plot can be confusing if one doesn't follow it closely.Anthony Hopkins plays Ted Crawford, the master planner who knows a bit too much for his own good. His arrogance will get the best of him. He is always a welcome presence in any film. We can't say we are fans of Ryan Gosling, as an actor, although we might be a minority. With the exception of ""Half Nelson"", he is a hard actor to warm up to, as it is the case with his Beachum. Maybe it was Mr. Hoblit's direction, but Mr.Gosling never gives the impression he is the winning lawyer one has been led to believe he is. Others in the film include Embeth Davidtz, who deserves much better. Rosemunde Pike who plays Nikki, the ambitious woman supervising Beachum, is not totally convincing.

23,george.schmidt,Hopkins and Gosling Make Affective Thrust & Parry,8,19 April 2007,"FRACTURE (2007) *** Anthony Hopkins, Ryan Gosling, David Strathairn, Rosamund Pike, Embeth Davidtz, Billy Burke, Cliff Curtis, Fiona Shaw, Bob Gunton, Josh Stamberg, Xander Berkeley, Zoe Kazan, Joe Spano. (Dir: Gregory Hoblit)Hopkins and Gosling Make Affective Thrust & ParryThe courtroom thriller is alive and well in the latest offering of Sir Anthony playing a meticulous structural engineer named Ted Crawford who shoots his cheating spouse Jennifer (the beautiful Davitz, one of my personal unsung faves, last seen in JUNEBUG), confessing to the police he did it and awaits his trial with an unnatural calming demeanor.Enter rookie prosecutor Willy Beachum (Gosling), a young turk who is on the verge of joining a prestigious law firm to shirk his civil duties for greener pastures, who is handed a seeming no-brainer for his boss Joe Lobruto (Strathairn) but soon discovers his lack of preparation and ambition is about to get the best of him.Crawford, a wily, brilliant and cagy man has decided to represent himself and proves an unexpectedly worthy adversary to the young lawyer to the extent that he may in fact be getting himself acquitted of the heinous, premeditated crime. Meanwhile Beachum is juggling his affair with his boss-to-be Nikki Gardner (Pike) as well as finding the murder weapon, which seems to have vanished into thin air.To add insult to injury Detective Rob Nunally (Burke), the cop who arrived at the scene and roughed up Crawford, is the one Jennifer has been having an affair  which Crawford had discovered and calls Nunally on it on the witness stand. The judge pressures Beachum to find hard evidence or else the case looks to be a loser. With time ticking away, his only witness in a coma and his entire career on the line, Beachum is in over his head with only his wits to get by on. That's what Crawford is hoping for.A crackling good screenplay by veteran Daniel Pyne (THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE remake) and cinematic newcomer Glenn Gers (TV's ""CYBILL"") offers some fine scenes of thrust and parry between the two leads, sprinkled with rueful humor and cunning observances that depicts Crawford as a sharp judge of character (he tells Beachum he already has spotted his character flaws during their preliminary meeting) and Beachum as a pressed- to-the-wall shrewd selfish type. Hopkins gives one of his best performances since his Oscar-winning, iconic turn as Hannibal Lecter (there are shades of his notorious character in playing with his young charge not unlike how he unnerved Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling) with canny, cunning ease and Gosling continues to prove to be an excellent sublime actor who echoes a young Paul Newman in his mannerisms and quiet, thoughtful line readings. Admittedly the plotting has some far-fetched moments of frustration (a key piece of evidence seriously not re-considered until the end?) but director Hoblit (best known for the similar courtroom thriller PRIMAL FEAR which brought back Richard Gere to the forefront of leading men and introduced a shocking turn by an excellent new talent, Edward Norton) knows how to roll with the punches to get to what is real and lets his actors show their chops in another wise familiar yet entertaining genre flick.",Fracture
24,neil-476,Excellent legal suspense thriller,8,12 February 2012,"In the first 5 or 10 minutes of Fracture we learn that Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) is a brilliant airframe engineer. We also learn that Ted's wife is having an affair, and we see him shoot her. When he is arrested shortly afterwards, the existence of a gun and a confession should mean that he will be convicted with the minimum of difficulty by whiz-kid DA Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling). However, Willie is coasting on his last case before he leaves the DAs office for the big bucks of commercial practice, and Ted appears to be having too much fun given the fix he is in. And he is very, very clever...The story here is not complex, but it is very strong, and told extremely well (the script - the film overall - is very sharp and stylish). The film is also beautifully photographed, and very well acted. Gosling shows more depth here than he did in any of the 3 films I saw him in during 2011, and Hopkins appears to be having as much fun as Ted is (although his accent wanders from country to country somewhat).I found this a pretty good movie.",Fracture
25,ferguson-6,Check the Pulse,6,20 April 2007,"Greetings again from the darkness. OK, the plot device for this thriller is about as sneaky as an 18-wheeler parked in your front yard. And as with most thrillers, the filmmakers took a few liberties along the way. Still, despite the obviousness, it is a fun little ride in the game of cat and mouse between Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling.Gosling is riding a hot streak now and his fast developing screen presence is on full display here ... this time with an exaggerated ""aw shucks"" drawl that would make Gerry Spence proud. Anthony Hopkins surprisingly plays the psychotic homicidal brainiac. Yeah, I'm just kidding. It really isn't surprising at all. Seems he just about has the corner on this market. Yet, we can't help but chuckle at his planned clumsiness and ""wink and nod"" approach.Gregory Hoblit directs the two sparring partners and takes the swooping camera motions a bit too far at times. A strong director knows when the actors and script will carry a scene and when it needs a boost. Hoblit's boosts consist of a hyper camera and a near-spoof of over-dramatic Hollywood mood music. Supporting work is interesting led by Rosamund Pike, David Straithairn and an all too brief turn from Embeth Davidtz.So if you are looking for a complicated suspense thriller, this isn't the one.

But despite this the movie suffers from a script that fails to keep that secret that would make the story work: most viewers will be able to figure out the 'mystery' far before its discovery poses the end of the film.Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) is an older wealthy man married for a year to a younger beauty (Embeth Davidtz) and happens to spy on her with her current paramour, detective Rob Nunally (Billy Burke), confronts her at home and shoots her in the face with the intention of killing her. But of course she is not dead: she is in a vegetative state in a hospital ICU by the next frame. Meanwhile a young lawyer Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling) while working for the District Attorney office with Joe Labruto (David Strathairn) sniffs that all is not right with the case while at the same time vying his career choices with transferring to a law firm under the eye of Nikki Gardner (Rosamund Pike). Willy is assigned to prosecute Crawford, but Crawford, defending himself, is acquitted because the murder weapon (gun) cannot be produced. THAT is the mystery: what happened to the needed evidence? The remainder of the story is how Willy solves the case and while most people will have figured it out, revealing it in a review robs potential viewers from the cat and mouse game the film is supposed to be.Both Hopkins and Gosling are superb, even with a script that is weak, and simply watching them perform is reason enough to see the film. The sets and filming are also fascinating and the pacing of the movie is satisfyingly tense. With a bit more imagination the story could have worked better. The 'stars rating' is for the Stars!

28,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Fracture,7,18 April 2007,"If you were salivating at the prospect of Ryan Gosling and Rosamund Pike getting hot and heavy under the sheets as suggested by the trailer, well, just so you know, all those uber sexy scenes got snipped off. Not that it's the work of the local film censors, as it's passed clean without cuts here, and watching the film transition between the scenes, it's gone without a hint of a bad edit. Somehow it's good to rid of the distractions to focus on the much touted cat and mouse game between Sir Anthony Hopkins' character and Gosling's, vis-a-vis a face off between a multi-award winning actor, and a young up and coming rising star.Anthony Hopkins' Ted Crawford seemed very much like Hannibal Lecter, no matter how anyone, even Hopkins, tries to disprove the notion. Perhaps it's after the recent dismal and disappointing Hannibal Rising, that audiences would do just anything to suspend disbelief and imagine it to be Lecter's return to the big screen done right, with that glint in the eye and the wry smile. I won't be surprised that someone in the crowd would have half expected Crawford to eat his wife after shooting her in the head. And Hopkins would have to showcase his acting chops once again, having done so with his Hannibal going up against the likes of luminaries like Judie Foster, Julianne Moore, Edward Norton, and now, Ryan Gosling.Gosling too had his fair share of playing a character obsessed with committing the perfect murder. In 2002's Murder by Numbers, he and peer Ben Chaplin did just that, and had to contend with Sandra Bullock's detective. Here, Gosling crosses over to the DA's office, his Willy Beachum a high flying scheming legal eagle who can't wait to spread his wings and soar over to the private sector for the fatter paycheck. Given his successes and reputation for wins, he takes on the State versus Ted Crawford case, in what is believed to be a simple open-and-shut legal suit, with signed confessions and what not, only to have his arrogance serve his downfall, and his redemption at eating the humble pie. As the old Chinese proverb says, ""the older ginger is hotter"".Courtroom dramas are nothing new to director Gregory Hoblit, having helmed films like Primal Fear and Hart's War. However, those who are expecting sparks to fly between defendant and prosecutor in the courtroom will be a tad disappointed. Hopkins and Gosling spend too little time together sharing the same scene and playing off each other's energies, and perhaps rightly so, otherwise everyone will be thinking it's yet another Hannibal tale. The spotlight is firmly set on Gosling, as we see him struggle against being soundly beaten by his adversary, and the fight against succumbing to temptation (OK, so he gave in and did it with his boss, but that we don't really see. So...). His Beachum is all about the seeking of redemption, in doing what's right, to try and put things right, nevermind if the result doesn't turn out the way it should be.There are a number of themes put forth in Fracture, some of which are topical, even to our own city state. Things like the lure of the private sector and that distinct smell of money, the imminent departure of the civil servant etc. What I thought was intriguing enough is the entire perversion of justice, laws, and the exploitation of loopholes which Crawford milks to perfection, that technically one can really walk away from a crime if you do your sums right.Those who are alert might find the revelation a bit wanting, and it's a full circle kinda lesson learnt about being overconfident leaning towards arrogance. It sets up the fall perfectly, but becomes anti-climatic given the dogged need for closure and doing so in too quick a time and coincidence. Then again, you might also consider that perhaps this is the most politically correct, face saving way to settle a stand off between a veteran, and a promising star.",Fracture
29,JamesHitchcock,Murder as a Fashion Statement,6,24 January 2013,"As in ""The Silence of the Lambs"", in ""Fracture"" Anthony Hopkins plays a ruthless criminal, but Ted Crawford, his character here, is very different to the insane Hannibal Lecter. Crawford is far from insane- indeed, he is cold, rational and calculating. He is a wealthy aeronautical engineer in Los Angeles who discovers that his much younger wife Jennifer is having an affair. He shoots her, leaving her paralysed and in a coma. (We learn that Crawford's full name is Theodore, although his accent suggests that he is from Britain. On this side of the Atlantic, ""Ted"" is generally a diminutive of Edward, and is not normally used for men named Theodore. Had Theodore Roosevelt been an Englishman, we would today talk about a ""Theo Bear"" rather than a ""Teddy Bear""). William Beachum, a deputy district attorney, is given the task of prosecuting Crawford. Beachum is regarded as something of a rising star in the DA's office, but has decided that his future does not lie in criminal law. He has been offered a position as a corporate lawyer with a major law firm, where his girlfriend Nikki already works, and the prosecution of Crawford will be his last. At first this appears to be an easy task. Crawford, who has waived his right to legal representation and is conducting his own defence, has made a full confession and the police have found the handgun apparently used in the crime. And then everything starts to go wrong. It transpires that Robert Nunally, the police detective who arrested Crawford, is the very man with whom Jennifer was having an affair. Crawford's confession is ruled inadmissible as evidence because the enraged Nunally assaulted him during the arrest. To make matters worse, forensic analysis reveals that Crawford's gun was not the one used in the shooting- indeed, it has never been fired. Faced with the imminent collapse of the prosecution case (something likely to do immense damage to his own career) the formerly cynical, materialistic Beachum becomes an ardent campaigner for justice, determined to prevent Crawford from manipulating the system to get away with his crime. The film ends with a neat twist, based on the ""Double Jeopardy Clause"", although whether this legal point would actually stand up in court is something I leave to those with a greater knowledge of the California criminal justice system than my own.Ted Crawford is not as compelling a character as ""Hannibal the Cannibal"", but Anthony Hopkins is always very watchable, and turns in another highly professional performance here as the smooth, plausible and manipulative killer. I must admit that I had never previously seen any film starring Ryan Gosling- indeed, I had only vaguely heard of him, even though he already has one Oscar nomination to his credit. Here, however, he shows himself to be a highly promising young actor, bringing out the two conflicting sides of Beachum's character as he is forced to ask himself whether the law exists to enable justice to be done, or merely to enable him to earn a fat salary. The critic Richard Schickel said about the film that ""It renders passion dispassionate and turns murder into a kind of fashion statement, something we observe without really caring about"". There is some justice in this charge, although the same charge could also be directed against many other recent American crime thrillers, in some cases with much greater force. It seems to me that the genre, together with its close cousin the cop thriller, now finds itself in the position which the Western and the war film found themselves in during the sixties and seventies. Those two types of film were in many ways victims of their own success; so many were made that the basic conventions of the two genres turned into over-familiar clichés and it became increasingly difficult for directors and scriptwriters to find anything new to say. Those two genres went into something of a decline after around 1975; it remains to be seen if the crime drama will go the same way. Certainly, the film does have a smooth, glossy appearance, and it may have been this look that inspired Schickel's ""fashion statement"" taunt. The director Gregory Hoblit, however, is an experienced hand at this type of film (he was, for example, also responsible for the very decent ""Primal Fear""), and ""Fracture"" does at least have a plot which generally makes sense, which is more than can be said for many modern murder mysteries. 6/10",Fracture
30,DKosty123,Grade B Courtroom Drama/ Grade A Acting & Production,6,9 June 2007,"After recently visiting LA & Hollywood, the scenery in this film definitely gave the feeling of being there again. The photography in the film is excellent. Anthony Hopkins & the entire cast were excellent in their acting roles too.Where the film falls short is in the murder plot & courtroom drama. I was able to figure out early on that the murder weapon & the Cops weapon were the same kind of gun. I was not surprised when this finally came out.The script though shrewdly filmed & acted had a couple of other things that didn't make sense. One of them is that if Hopkins character had known enough to arrange the rest of this logically, why would he be so stupid as to pull the cord on his wife which opened the door to his own fracture? At least that is consistent with the plot.The other thing is that at the end, it closes with the same DA lawyer starting the murder trial against him. In reality, it should have ended with Willy, the DA, on the witness stand testifying against him & since he was a material witness in the case the head of the DA's office or someone else should have been the lawyer for the case at the closing. Putting Willy there is a nice special effect, but the way the case was solved, his testimony would have been key in new trial.With this, to me the acting & production values make this a solid B movie- worth watching to be entertained but not quite a great film.",Fracture

32,sddavis63,"Well, I Guess It Is More Interesting Than Watching Paint Dry",2,4 June 2008,"I watched ""Fracture"" essentially because it starred Anthony Hopkins. I think Hopkins is a fine actor, and his character of Ted Crawford sounded as though it would be a little bit reminiscent of his great work in ""Silence Of The Lambs"" as Hannibal Lector (Crawford being an ice cold killer who plays mind games with the police and the DA.) I wasn't expecting it to be as good as ""Silence"" but I thought it had a lot of potential. Instead, it was very disappointing; one of the weaker performances I've seen Hopkins give.Almost from the beginning, the story was mundane and predictable. (Even the opening musical score sounded like something less than original, and seemed to fit more with a made for TV story than a Hollywood movie.) The big mystery here was what happened to the gun Crawford used. Unfortunately, anyone who remotely paid attention to this (true, that wasn't always easy) should be able to figure that one out at least an hour before the movie ends with its ""twist."" Hopkins was at best OK as Crawford, and Ryan Gosling underwhelmed me with his portrayal of prosecutor Willy Beachum, whose mind just isn't on the case since he's on the verge of leaving the DA's office for a job with a big, prestigious law firm. The most bizarre, meaningless and totally unnecessary subplot here was the budding romance between Beachum and his soon to be boss at the new firm Nikki Gardner (Rosamund Pike.) I scratched my head several times over that one. She introduces herself to him as his new boss, and within a couple of scenes, she's in bed with him and inviting him to Thanksgiving dinner at her family's home?It gets a point up from me for the only ""twist"" that got me - which was the Douple Jeopardy twist at the end of the picture.

33,Buddy-51,shrewdly executed courtroom thriller,7,29 April 2007,"Blessed with a smart script, stylish direction and first-rate performances by Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling, ""Fracture"" emerges as more than just the ""Silence of the Lambs"" knock-off it would appear to be on the surface.In a role reminiscent of a somewhat toned-down (i.e. non-cannabilistic) Hannibal Lecter, Hopkins plays Ted Crawford, a wealthy L.A. businessman who shoots his wife when he discovers she's having an affair with a hostage negotiator. Crawford readily admits to the crime, giving the police a signed confession and insisting on defending himself in court. Gosling is Willy Beachum, a cocky, up-and-coming public prosecutor who takes the case believing it will be one last slam-dunk victory for him before he moves on to bigger and better things at a prestigious private law firm downtown. Beachum gets more than he bargained for, however, when the creepy and unnerving Crawford begins to play the legal system for all it's worth, tweaking the hotshot lawyer by outthinking him and continually knocking him off his game.In less capable hands, ""Fracture"" could easily have been a standard-issue, twist-and-turn courtroom drama, but thanks to the talents involved, it transcends the limitations of its genre. Daniel Pyne and Glenn Gers have written a screenplay filled with witty, crackling dialogue and sharply observed insights into the psyches of its two principal characters. Hopkins and Gosling play the cat-and-mouse game with conviction and gusto, while director Gregory Hoblit and cinematographer Kramer Morgenthau use a smoothly gliding camera and a barely perceptible visual distortion at the edges of the picture to highlight the ""fractured"" nature of the piece. Moreover, the film has a nice L.A. feel to it, as it takes us to various interesting sites around town, including the ultra-modern, near-surrealistic Disney Concert Hall located in the heart of the city.There is strong supporting work by David Straitharn (""Good Night, and Good Luck""), Billy Burke, Rosamund Pike and Fiona Shaw (""Mountains of the Moon""), among others, but it is Hopkins and Gosling, locked in a life-or-death battle of acumen and wits, who make ""Fracture"" a perpetually compelling and watchable courtroom thriller.",Fracture
34,cherold,not especially smart or interesting,4,8 July 2008,"Fracture has good performances and is slickly filmed but is ultimately done in by the script, with which there are two basic problems. First off, it moves rather slowly. Hopkins character is intriguing and the other guy is likable, but Hopkins has a very small part, really, and the main character's experiences aren't really enough to sustain the movie. Which wouldn't be so bad, if it wasn't that the script also fails to deliver the sort of clever twists one expects in a ""cat and mouse"" style movie. The big hunt for the vital clue is ludicrous; I knew where it was an hour and a half before the movie, after giving increasingly obvious clues, let the audience in on the secret. Admittedly I've seen a ton of these movies, so I'm pretty good at guessing, but this one seemed punch-me-in-the-face obvious.The movie also makes a ham-fisted attempt to generate suspense with a court order scene that went badly only because the main character acted so stupidly.And that's the problem; it's a dumb movie masquerading as a smart movie, and not doing a very good job of it.",Fracture
35,Robert_duder,A very intelligent mystery with the criminal mastermind of the century,8,11 August 2007,"Fracture has one key element that automatically puts it heads and tails above other 'thrillers' or 'mystery' type films. Any guesses? Sir Anthony Hopkins. I'm not saying he's perfect or that every film he has done is gold...Alexander anyone? But in this film in particular his downright disturbing, and twisted performance (which is still completely different from Hannibal Lecter) takes the cake. Fortunately the rest of the cast is strong as well and the story is quite well built. I almost thought the film would pull an easy 9 heading for a 10 but unfortunately they went with the ending that kind of went in the wrong direction as far as I was concerned. The entire film is so well written, and very intelligent and this great intellectual game of cat and mouse and they blow it by making the final discovery by our hero so cheesy. There is nothing wrong with the WAY the film ends but rather how it gets there. Having seen this on DVD I can tell you there are two alternate endings on the DVD and Alternate Ending #1 is far and away better than the ending they chose to go with. Nonetheless it's not easy to find a thriller that can entertain, keep you guessing and still be very smart so Fracture is a gem. Plus the cast is something to watch for.Ryan Gosling has become something of the ""It"" boy lately in Hollywood. He seems to be a genuinely good actor with mainstream appeal that the kids and teens of movie stardom love him since his turn as the rugged good guy in The Notebook. Gosling plays young, hot shot attorney Willy Beachum who is just trying to rush through his last week as a public prosecutor before moving up to a big private firm. Gosling definitely has conceited and big shot down to a fine art and I hope for his sake it stays as a part on the screen because people seem to respect him for being 'down to earth.' As Beachum he does go through an important transformation as he goes up against this mastermind who seems to outsmart him at every turn. Despite how young Gosling is, maybe just a tad too young for Beachum, he does a great job especially considering who he has to go up against. I hate to respect an actor just because of the actor that he is but Anthony Hopkins...man he's Anthony Freakin' Hopkins but then he is that person for a reason...because he has had some incredible roles and his performance in Fracture shows us why he is respected. Hopkins has done bad guy before...in fact he's played one of the most villainous bad guys in movie history as Hannibal Lecter and here he is again locked behind bars playing games with the legal system and it could have been so easily a simple throwback to Lecter but it wasn't. His performance as Ted Crawford is really thrilling. He's so devious and brilliant and gives anyone a run for their money. His artistic mind makes him a deadly adversary in the court room and his demeanor and grandfatherly look make him all the more terrifying. This performance should probably garner Hopkins an Oscar nod at the very least. A character actor I am quickly coming to greatly respect is David Strathairn, who most recently impressed me in the mind blowing Bourne Ultimatum. Strathairn has a small but impressive role as the head of the D.A.'s office Joe Lobruto, and Willy's boss. He only has a few scenes and all of them opposite Gosling but he's a very good presence. Rosamund Pike will be Willy's new boss at the new firm Nikki Gardner. Now I have a problem with Pike's character and she does an alright job but she's thrown into this film as eye candy, as a sex kitten and this is not a film that needs that element other than to force it into more of a mainstream film. She is supposed to be this high ranking lawyer in this big firm and the future boss of this young attorney and within days of meeting him she's propositioning him and they are sleeping together. It's unfortunate that the only lead female has such a poor image for this film. Billy Burke, Cliff Curtis (another great character actor I've come to appreciate as of late), and Embeth Davidtz as the victim all have small but decent roles and do a great job to round out the cast in this killer thriller.Director Gregory Hoblit, if anything, knows how to tell a great story. Hart's War, and Frequency are two films that I think were made superior to what they could have been because of his direction. He knows how to put his actors to the very utmost and Fracture is no different. If only they had chosen a different follow in to the ending. Still for a mystery film you won't be disappointed in it's pace and action and the characters. Check it out for mystery fans everywhere!! 8.5/10",Fracture
36,Lejink,Shot With His Own Gun,7,6 January 2008,"Stylised but watchable thriller with two goodish twists at the end to keep the viewer entertained until the final reel. Ultimately it fails to make it to the top grade by dint of employing a redundant sub-plot with the Ryan Gosling lawyer character embroiled within 5 seconds in an affair with his new, obviously glamorous female boss and a certain lack of directorial pace and for want of a better phrase, flourish in bringing the frankly fantastical plot to life. Anthony Hopkins gets to play a sort of vegetarian Hannibal Lector part, but gets less screen time than Ryan Gosling in a sort of sub-Jake Gylenhaal role, (there's a physical resemblance too) as the ambitious public servant (deputy district attorney) upstaged and outsmarted by Hopkins at trial until the two ""Eureka"" moments (confusion over a pair of mobile phones and a correction of terminology by his D.A. boss) enable him to at last expose and capitalise on the flaw, or fracture if you will, in Hopkins' perfect murder. The lead acting is fine, although Hopkins occasionally lurches into a cod - Scottish / Irish accent for no apparent reason (maybe he was bored), while Gosling holds up well by committing to a part that must have seemed shallow on paper. In summary though, it plays like a well-written ""Colombo"" episode with a little more gloss applied and never really delivers on the thrills.

It's a clever idea for a film, and it works out quite interestingly, but a little far fetched and unbelievable (i.e. Hopkins drawing attention in court to his wife having an affair, giving him a great motive for killing her.) Because the plot is so slovenly, the narrative flow is really lost by the end and it's all got a little boring.On the performances front, Hopkins just regurgitates his Hannibal Lecter routine over again, his character coming off as a little autistic. Gosling, bless him, tries hard but over-acts and comes off as hammy.

When Tony Hopkins exploded onto western TV in what many believe to be the first ever made for TV miniseries -- QB 7 -- it was in the courtroom scenes that he excelled. Something about his presence, his physical demeanour, made him the Alpha male in every scene.This was never more obvious than in Silence where he used this trait to bring Hannibal to life in a way that none of us will ever forget.Hopkins was 70 years young when he played the meticulous planner in Fracture who bends the legal system to his will.

And, the accent is not consistent throughout the film.Good: Great story, well scripted and directed.But, 2 out of 3 being bad...that's not good! Anthony Hopkins' acting here is excellent, as always. But he doesn't look at all like the logical husband of the victim. He looks old an haggard.Ryan Gosling is a good actor, and with the exception of the accent here, he handles the part well.David Strathairn, who has a support role as District Attorney, is a wonderful actor. In films like this I often just wish he had bigger parts! Rosamund Pike as Gosling's love interest was fine, but to a large extent I found her role to be somewhat irrelevant. Billy Burke as a police officer and the man having an affair with Hopkins' wife was satisfactory. Cliff Curtis as a detective, also satisfactory.All in all, it's a good film marred by miscasting and weird accents.",Fracture

Hopkins plays a remarkably intelligent professional who becomes aware of his wife's affair with a police officer and plans getting away with her murder. It is up to Gosling, a rather unlikeable, ego-centric lawyer to put Hopkins away if he can. This taut and psychologically thrilling movie is weighted down with Gosling's character's own repulsive character through most of the movie, the rather unconvincing romantic relationship he somehow develops during the movie, Goslings ambiguous evolving relationship with the comatose wife, and the telegraphed technical legalistic twist that occurs at the end. Hopkins seems to again offer up a captivating character in the same mold as Hannibal Lector that somehow fits with the tone and plot design of the movie.",Fracture
43,ironhorse_iv,This movie is so overlooked. Another look could heal this fracture.,7,11 November 2014,"This movie is a hidden gem of court room crime drama mystery/thriller/suspense. Directed by Gregory Hoblit of 1996's Primal Fear and written by Daniel Pyne, this movie was one of the sleeper hits of 2007. It's really need to be awoken, again for new fans to see. The movie tells the story of a meticulous wealthy and talented Irish aeronautical engineer, Theodore ""Ted"" Crawford (Anthony Hopkins), whom is accused of attempted murder on his wife, Jennifer (Embeth Davidtz) for having an affair. A young district attorney, William ""Willy"" Beachum (Ryan Gosling), believes the trial is going to an open-and-shut case, due to the overwhelming evidence and agrees to go to trial immediately, without much research. Beachum is much too busy, making preparations for his transition from criminal law to corporate attorney for Wooton & Simms, a well-known law firm, and having a romantic relationship with his future boss, Nikki Gardner (Rosamund Pike). When the day of the trial come thru, the young assistant district attorney find every evidences, backfiring on him, as he gets locked in a battle of wits with the crafty opponent, Crawford. Can William find a way to win or will Crawford get away with murder? Watch it to find out! Without spoiling too much, the movie story is packed with twists and turns that weave in and out of the courtroom as the pair try to outwit each other. A lot of things, do kinda spoil the movie. One thing to avoid is the trailer. As the movie trailer, pretty much, give you very clear clues on what's going to happen. There is a good debate, between 'Fracture' fans if any of the events really state out in real court. The ending of the film is a good example of such; do to the fact; that many question, if it's logical. Makes you wonder if the act of pulling the plug constitutes murder or is this truly legally permissible? Does that make the hospital staff accessories to murder? Also, does it work or not work in a Double Jeopardy Clause? If I remember, if you're acquitted of one, it applies to the other as well. It's really up to question. Even well trained lawyers have a hard time, answering this question. One thing, I do know, is the ending was absolutely ingenious and perfect. The end was hinted at throughout the movie, about how there's a crack in everyone and everyone makes mistakes. Hopkins is great as the main villain. He evokes the same dark area that his 1991's Silence of the Lambs counterpart character, Hannibal Lector, lives for this role. While, Crawford isn't as vicious as Lector, he does have that creepy factor put in. Still, the Irish accent is a bit, too much. Anthony Hopkins keep slipping in an out of an Irish accent during this film. Ryan Gosling is good in the role as the young lead, but it's really hard to believe that he's a hot shot lawyer with such a baby face. I think the film would have work better, with a more mature looking male lead like Matthew Mcconaughey. He's a bit too young looking for somebody who went to law school. Still, Ryan Gosling hold up against Anthony, and his intonation level of his voice makes it worth, rooting for him when things go wrong for him like evidence being inadmissable in court as fruit of the poisonous tree since it was obtained under duress. You really see him, taking up the challenge to find a way to prove Crawford's guilt. After all, there is nearly nobody else, worth rooting for, as the other characters are pretty unlikeable. One thing, the movie could do without is the unnecessary romance between Nikki and Willy. It felt forced and wasn't needed. It felt like filler. The movie was beautiful shot with constricting camera angles. The opening shot was great in foreshadowing the film. You see both Crawford hubristic confidence and his ability to quickly identify weaknesses. The Rolling Ball sculpture, represented the story so well; symbolic of the numerous complicated and crafty plot twists that Crawford has create. You find overall, that the movie is like the six foot high rolling ball sculpture. Crawford is the one that put the ball into motion, slowly rolling, it might be boring at first, but after a few minutes gathering momentum, the film is delighting as it twist and turns to its final stop at the bottom. You can't help feeling amazed, on well build, it was.",Fracture

At almost two hours, ""Fracture"" seems really bloated. Unlike ""Columbo"", where you have the lovable Peter Falk, here you have zero likable characters. The killer, Anthony Hopkins is very smart, but totally unsympathetic. The district attorney, Ryan Gosling, is a smarmy yuppie, who elicits no sympathy. Even the victim, a cheating wife, who we know nothing about, is unsympathetic. The entire film is nothing more than a battle of egos, a bunch of padding in the form of a new position for the D.A. in a law firm, and a dead end love interest with one of the firm's female attorney's.

45,zkonedog,A Bit Too Smart For It's Own Good,6,9 April 2017,"There is indeed an engaging air of mystery surrounding ""Fracture"" that will keep you watching/interested until the very end. Only helping matters is the star-studded cast. The problem that prevents ""Fracture"" from being a great film, however? It just ends up being too smart for it's own good.For a basic plot summary, ""Fracture"" sees Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) kill his wife (who had been cheating on him) in a jealous rage. There is no doubt that he did the deed, and what with the signed confession and murder weapon in hand, it looks to be a slam-dunk case. Opposing Crawford in court is Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling), a hot-shot young lawyer about to move on to bigger and better things. This final case will be his swan song as a public defender...until it proves to be much more difficult when Beachum finds that Crawford is a bit more savvy than he lets on.The reason I can call ""Fracture"" a good movie is because an air of mystery exists pretty much throughout. It seems straightforward, but of course one keeps waiting for the other shoe to drop. Hopkins is perfect as the debonair accused murderer, while Gosling also shines in his youthful role. The movie really starts out with a lot of energy and intrigue and seems to be set up for a remarkable conclusion.The problem, however, is that when that other ""shoe"" does drop, it lands with a resounding ""thud"". Clearly, ""Fracture"" was leading up to a climax that it could not possibly deliver, so instead it tries to fool the audience and ends up out-smarting itself.For example (MAJOR SPOILERS):-The notion of the cop's sworn statement being thrown out of court because he was the dead wife's lover is the first clue of what the ending is going to be. I'm not an ultra-realist when it comes to movies, but c'mon here...this is kind of idiocy.-So many minutes of the film are devoted to finding the real murder weapon, yet I was severely let down that it was truly resolved in a scene that the audience could never really see coming. Don't spend so much time on this single plot point and then cop out with what basically amounts to an ""off-camera scene"" being the answer.-Finally (and this is the big one), Crawford is eventually caught because apparently he doesn't understand a technicality involving the principle of double jeopardy. Really?! The entire movie sets Crawford up to be a genius, and this is his demise? Embarrassing.So, while ""Fracture"" did do a lot of things right in terms of mystery, pacing, and acting, it is such an intellectual letdown in the end that it only pulls in at ""slightly above average"". Perhaps more casual viewers, or those who take things a bit more at face-value, won't be bothered by some of the ridiculous developments in the film, but for those who really focus on character development and consistency it is extremely frustrating to have all the characters fall apart towards the end (at least in terms of how they acted for most of the film).",Fracture

Fracture doesn't have much to offer in the way of thrills. It compensates with a pair of highly entertaining performances and slick, colorful cinematography. Hopkins, brings an impish sense of humor to the villainous Crawford, throwing wisecracks in the court and ringing his nemesis from prison to tease him about his lack of progress. Ryan Gosling, while, is a spinning of sullen energy, forever clashing with his peers and casually romancing Rosamunde Pike's legal ice queen.

47,filipemanuelneto,"Good, but still could improve.",4,26 June 2019,"In this ""court movie"" we have the simple situation of a vain lawyer, accustomed to winning cases, who is faced with the difficult task of proving that a powerful businessman killed his wife. Cold and thoughtful, he manages to anticipate every step of the prosecution lawyer and is determined to seize every asset to confuse and shuffle him. To make matters even more complicated, the prosecution lawyer is in the process of being hired to work in a large and important business law firm, and hiring largely depends on his performance in this case.I have little to say about the script ... the story seems to me well built and developed, and the twists that happen are, in fact, what keeps people stuck in the film. However, it is not very credible, it could be even better and there are some loose ends that can bother you. Plus, it's a bit predictable. Ryan Gosling is convincing in his character. Together with veteran Anthony Hopkins, who gave life to the villain, dominates the film, and how the two characters interact and provoke help greatly to maintain the interest of the public. We really want to know which of the two will come out on top. The remaining cast is limited to the space that the two protagonists leave free. I would particularly highlight the good contribution of Fiona Shaw. Rosamund Pike, meanwhile, despite being like a fish in the water on yet another ice cold character, seems to be left in the film. Technically, the film has quality as well. Good camera game, nice color and light, a regular soundtrack but it does what it needs to do.Overall, this movie does what it claims to do, but it can not do enough to exceed what it is regular and become truly good.",Fracture

49,robert-temple-1,A Modern Noir Which Does Not Disappoint,9,10 January 2009,"This is a most successful thriller. In terms of performances, the most outstanding is certainly by Rosamund Pike. She has made a big impression in Britain by appearing in classic television dramas, at which she has a natural talent, and for which she is suited without expending a great deal of effort. Here, however, she shows what stuff she is really made of. She delivers an impeccable noir performance in the very best 1940s-1950s Hollywood style, and if the opportunities were frequent enough, she could readily establish a niche for herself as a chilling lead femme fatale in countless big budget films. She has a cold, distant, exquisite beauty, a perfect neck. and eyes like dark mirrors with disturbing supernatural qualities. Because she is a bit of an intellectual offscreen, well-read and bookish, she has the intelligence to put a brooding mystery into her gaze, and is best at doing this as someone powerful or knowledgeable. She also knows how to convince us that she may be off her rocker, simply by wobbling her irises. She would not make a good 'Big Brother' participant, and could not successfully play an oaf, I daresay. (Oafs are in big demand these days, and Ryan Gosling plays one, appearing not to be able to hold a fork properly at dinner.) Pike should team up with Audrey Tautou ('the Elf'), as Pike-and-Elf would be an irresistible combo on screen, as their big eyes full of mysterious things would go so well together, and they would enhance one another. As for the rest of the film, there is also Embeth Davidtz, a fascinating actress who made such an impression in the admirable 'Junebug' (2005), and it is such a shame for such a beautiful creature to get shot so soon in the story. One weakness of the story is the total lack of back-story, and why a man old enough to be Davidtz's grand-father happens to be her husband, but I guess if you are determined to cast Anthony Hopkins, you just have to close your eyes and go ahead. The acting of Hopkins has improved immeasurably since the days when he was so mannered and chewed so many of his words that he drove me crazy, and I found him one of the world's most irritating actors. He has somehow miraculously purged himself of all those terrible acting faults he used to have, and now plays it straight, with a terrifying intensity of an 'in your face' challenge. At last, Anthony Hopkins has come of age, and about time, too. Finally, he has become the master of his craft that everyone wrongly imagined him to be earlier. (Maybe this is a classic example of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Shall we grant him retrospective absolution for his technical sins in so many earlier films?) Ryan Gosling is, I suppose, very good at playing his unsympathetic and arrogant character, and it works, but just by a whisker. Kramer Morgenthau as the cinematographer has come out of television and has been having fun playing with light on a big budget. He gets a lot of interesting shots by sunlight at an angle, and well done for that. He avoids the worst perils of excessively dark shots which have been so fashionable in recent years (as irritating as actors who insist on mumbling), so that when he shoots dark shots, which he does repeatedly and too much, they are not as irritating as in most contemporary films, because he somehow redeems himself for these excesses by a sensitivity to light which just saves him, time and time again. He is a natural-born tightrope walker. The director Gregory Hoblit has also come out of television and proved effortlessly that he is a very good big budget director, no prob. The story by Daniel Pyne and screenplay by Pyne and Glenn Gers are most ingenious and top quality, although lacking in wisecracks and witty asides, and hence a shade too earnest. (Try to pepper your next script with some spicy one-liners next time, fellas. Watch some old movies and learn how it is done.) There are two central enigmas to this story, and I was so pleased with myself that I figured them both out (the missing gun riddle and a legal point). However, you have to have seen a lot of thrillers before you can hope to do that. This really is a nail-biter, a first-rate mystery and a modern noir classic.",Fracture
50,Chris Knipp,"Actors duel, viewers go hungry",7,22 April 2007,"There have been five films called ""Fracture."" What does it mean this time? It doesn't matter, it sounds sharp, new. It bespeaks controlled conflict. And that conflict is none other than a duel between two actors, old and young: Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling. This is a slam bang crime and courtroom drama that holds your interest; but it's conventional stuff. What makes it worth seeing is nothing more nor less than the two good players. The fact of their coming together at this moment gives rise to certain questions. Has Hopkins gotten lazy? Is Gosling as fine an actor as people think -- or have his few great or offbeat roles been a fluke? The answer is yes to all that. Hopkins has indeed become lazy, but he's still a commanding presence. And Gosling is certainly one of the finest American film actors of his generation, but his choices of roles have been erratic.Hopkins plays a smart killer. Is this going to be a reprise of his Hannibal Lector? No, it isn't. The actor controls his little smiles, and his quips never suggest the Lector hysteria. He is surprising and still. Maybe he's being lazy, but it works. He seems to have turned into a sort of mellow blob, poison in stillness, like a jellyfish. He doesn't move, but if you walk into him, he will sting you. As the aeronautics magnate Ted Crawford he telegraphs to us right off how arrogant he is. He brushes off an underling and roars away from his business in a megabucks Italian muscle car. He goes home and shoots his wife, who's been cheating on him, in the face, and fires other shots that are heard by gardeners on his estate. The far-fetched plot requires that the cop who comes to negotiate with him thereafter is the adulterer. We must not ask how this turns out to be an intricate part of a prearranged plan. Crawford confesses, but then in court recants and calmly undertakes his own defense.Gosling is Willy Beachum, an outstanding young L.A. prosecuting attorney who's just been hired by a big corporate law firm when he's called in for the formality of Ted Crawford's arraignment. Of course it turns out to be no formality. Beacham is caught off guard by Crawford's smug self defense; as Crawford anticipates, the police can't find a murder weapon. The pistol he had in his hand when captured was never fired. Beachum is a winner who's an underdog, a star attorney with a gilded future who's also an Oakie from poor origins, now expected to please the privileged and kowtow to them, and faced with a trial that will ruin him if he loses. If we know Gosling we know none of that is going to happen. But he too restrains himself, holding back the preening arrogance that made him so striking as the Jewish Nazi skinhead in ""The Believer."" The underdog casting fits the actor's physicality. Gosling has a trim whiplash of a body, but there's something nerdy about his face and unsubtle about his manner, a rawness that is what made the dogmatism of his character in ""The Believer"" so convincing. In the merciless close-ups that are ""Fracture's"" crude but arresting visual style he looks bristly and unshaven, with a mousy crew cut. The important thing is the way he struts about in his nice new suits, not how well they fit him. He may look like the grownup Mousecateer he is, but he's got balls of brass and he's got chops. He has the ability to make every line reading sound right.Beachum is taken in tow, she thinks anyway, by a luscious (but generic) blonde WASP queen from the corporate law firm, Nikki Gardner (Rosamund Pike), who's to be his supervisor, and seems drawn to his energy, as they say. She invites him to her family Thanksgiving and he thanks her. ""Don't thank me yet,"" she quips. Such hinting at the everyday realities of familial dysfunctionality or sheer boredom is a thing rare in this piece. ""Fracture"" isn't particularly concerned with ordinary human relations. It's not about human relations at all. It's about moving forward, gobbling up our attention as it pursues its crime/trial story.Crawford has a bombshell. In court he reveals what we know: the cop who caught him, Rob Nunully (Billy Burke) was screwing his wife. Later Beachum tells Nunully, ""You told me (Crawford) was smart. You didn't tell me you were stupid."" We have to be stupid too to believe this plot.There's not so much sleuthing as posturing here. We never see the cops going over Crawford's house, though we see its grandly modernist interior and elaborate gazebo sculptures, and the police are supposed to be searching it three times for the murder weapon. The excellent David Striathern as District Attorney gets lost in the ruthless mechanisms of the screenplay. He's just a neutral realist periodically analyzing Beachum's situation for him (and us), when he could have been the moral center. His part is too underwritten to give him true weight. Crawford's wife isn't dead. She's in the hospital in a coma. This is an ace in the hole for the film's glib writers: a victim in limbo is the opportunity for plot twists after the trial goes wrong for Beachum. ""Fracture"" is exciting enough while we're watching it, though it achieves a lot of that by maximizing a few surprises and pumping up the adrenalin with loud bops and crashes in the soundtrack. The plot is so full of air holes you're hungry shortly after its over like after Chinese food in the old joke; all you remember is the duel of two outstanding actors. Gosling has gotten to do something a bit different (for him) and Hopkins has managed to do something similar (for him) without ever boring us. The bravura performances are fun. But we all deserved better.",Fracture
51,elshikh4,"The movie's trick, and the movie as a trick !",5,27 September 2012,"This movie's script has one thing; the trick that the killer used to kill his wife, and get away with it, namely using the police officer's gun. Save that, you won't find anything else to watch or respect. Most probably, they wrote that trick first, then made a movie around it. The bad thing is that they didn't make a real movie though. All what they had to do was no more than: bland courtroom sessions with (Anthony Hopkins) playing with a pen and paper, (Ryan Gosling) sleeping or arguing with (Rosamund Pike) for no apparent reason but filling the empty spaces, (Gosling) reading poetry to the shot-in-the-head, not dead yet, wife (He got sympathized with her? When? And why?!), (Gosling) watching a toy of rolling bolls pointlessly, then (Hopkins) watching the same toy pointlessly as well. And yeah, to top it all; seeing (Hopkins) winks, and winks and winks!(Gosling) is trying his best to be opportunist, dumb, ideal, emotional, and Columbo all in the same time. He eventually looked between tense and hollow (cultivated words for unconvincing!). His only fault is agreeing to do this faulty script in the first place. But to tell you the truth, who would refuse being in front of the mighty (Anthony Hopkins)? Nevertheless, (Hopkins) wasn't any mighty here! He was just phoning in his lines, fooling around with his charisma, or should I say aging charisma? He was 70 at the time, but strangely enough, he seemed over 80 for me! The experienced actor that he certainly is, must have known pretty early that this is a movie to watch, not to think about. Enough to tell you, that while being a guest in ""Inside the Actor Studio"", (Hopkins) described (Fracture) as ""Hollywood popcorn movie"". But whatever he made it for the money, being there, or as a vehicle to launch (Gosling) as a movie star-he did it without spending any effort whatsoever!There are nearly no characters, but smart killer and lover officer. (Rosamund Pike) plays the ultimate unnecessary role ever written. No acumen needed to understand that she's here for being a good female sight on the male-crowded poster. In regard to the pace, it runs as an existential movie, while - in fact - it's a movie with nothing ""existent"" to present. The dialogue can't get more idiot. For instance, review all of (Hopkins)'s lines; the script wanted to portray him as the Einstein of killers, to end up as fortune cookies master. A point I hated: why (Gosling) didn't use the ""fake proof"" card at the court as he intended previously? That turned the whole event into utter baloney, or free lesson to define the ""anticlimax"" practically. A point I hated more: when (Hopkins) killed his wife, how he was so sure that the police would send the very officer, who used to sleep with his wife, to the scene of crime?! Just imagine, if this officer wasn't at work that night, (Hopkins) would have been executed in no time!Director (Gregory Hoblit) did better before. Primal Fear (1996) was a true courtroom drama, even Fallen (1998), with many negative points, was more movie-like than (Fracture). This round, he had no actual script to picture, rather some people walk and talk (and wink!), of which he executed with elegant image, and great tedium. So when I read, on IMDb, reviews about this movie entitled: ""Classy, Entertaining Battle-Of-Wits Film"", ""Style with the Substance to Match"", ""A Knockout of a Movie"", ""Shrewdly Executed Courtroom Thriller"", I feel that whoever wrote these must work in the line of comedy or politics, accordingly; they can either make good laughs, or good lies!This is a Columbo episode with almost the same structure: a murder, super-smart super-rich murderer that thinks he committed the perfect crime, another murder as a result for the first, a protagonist who uncovers the murderer's secret trick, a denouement, the murderer is caught without much noise, shootout, or car chase. The difference is that we have no (Peter Folk), no antics, no wit, no drama, no thrill, and no nothing (talk about the perfect crime!). And instead of being 70 minutes long TV episode, it's 113 minutes long cinematic movie that you pay to watch. To say it frankly; (Fracture) is boring waste of time, and with (Hopkins)'s name disappointing too. They should have named it (Fractured), (Hopkins's winking hysteria), or simply (The Trick); meaning the trick that the whole movie is built on, and made for. Or the trick that this movie itself is!",Fracture
52,JoeB131,"You, sir, are no Hannibal Lecter.",5,3 September 2007,"Okay, let's get that out of the way first off, because everyone reviewing this movie compares Ted Crawford to Hopkins award winning role as Hannibal the Cannibal. Don't do that. This is a totally different kind of character.The problem with this movie is that you feel more sympathy for the villain than you do for the hero, and that's always a weak movie. Yes, he manipulates his wife's lover into botching the case against him (with the totally improbable premise that he would just happen to draw THAT officer in this situation.) But you don't feel any sympathy for either of them because their characters are not likable. Then they introduce the hotshot lawyer who takes this case, but he's got one foot out the door and is more interested in getting that six-figure private job than actually seeing justice done in this case. So when Hopkin's character pulls a fantastic legal maneuver on them, you kind of cheer for the guy.That leads to a long part in the middle where Gosling's character actually tries to do the right thing and do his job, but he can't because he really has no case.The explanation for the gun was actually pretty clever.The movie falls apart at the end when Crawford decides to pull the plug on his wife (shades of Terri Schiavo) and Gosling's character charges him with murder (unlikely) after finally figuring out how he did it.An Okay movie, not a great one.",Fracture
53,alindsay-al,An above average suspensful thriller,6,15 May 2018,"When you see the cast for this film and hear the premise of the film it definitely makes you think that Fracture should be a legendary film but unfortunately it is just an alright film. The premise of the film sees a Lawyer attempt to take down a man who shot his wife and confessed to the crime. This film clearly marketed Anthony Hopkins as the lead for this film, but in my opinion Ryan Gosling's character is the lead for this film and he is excellent in the role. It is weird to see him so young but he exuberates charm and confidence that makes you care about his character and root for him to succeed. Anthony Hopkins is very good in this film, he is very creepy but charming at the same time as well, but he isn't in this film as much as you would expect which could upset a few people. The supporting cast has some pretty big names in it, David Strathairn and Cliff Curtis are pretty good in their roles that helps in building Goslings character and his relationship with these people. However, there was also Rosamund Pike and Billy Bush who don't play particularly interesting characters and in Pike's case drag the movie down as I will mention later in the review. The story has a really interesting dynamic between Gosling and Hopkins that drives this movie, the best part of the film is the courtroom scenes that these two share together. Though there is a plot line between Gosling and Pike that I really didn't care about and really held up the interesting parts of the movie. Also I wasn't satisfied with the ending of this movie and could have done with a bit more meat to it. The script has some pretty decent dramatic moments in it that builds the tension well. Though this film also has some weird attempts at comedy that doesn't quite work when it conflicts with the overall tone of the film. The style of the film keeps you on your toes as you're not sure what is coming next in the film. Though the biggest problem with this film is the pacing, I can't help that for quite a bit of this film I was pretty bored.

54,MBunge,It's like the script is an IQ test and it's the writers who failed,4,20 September 2010,"This film has some of the worst screen writing you'll ever encounter. Its striving for dour solemnity can't disguise its laughably shallow characters, backasswards structure and arbitrarily unsatisfying ending. This courtroom drama also has a grand total of just two twists and each one is telegraphed a half hour before it happens. I don't mean that if you watch Fracture closely you can pick up on little clues that let you know what the twists will be. I mean the movie literally tells you what the twists will be in such explicit fashion that when they actually occur, you barely notice it.Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) is a wealthy engineer whose much younger wife is cheating on him. After spying on Jennifer (Embeth Davidtz) and her lover at their hotel bungalo, Ted shoots Jennifer in the head when she gets home. The cops surround Ted's house and the detective in charge of the situation, Rob Nunally (Billy Burke), turns out to be Jennifer's lover. Ted provokes Rob into attacking him before being taken into custody.Now after that beginning, you would probably expect Fracture to be a taught and complex cat-and-mouse game between Ted and Rob. It's not. T he movie now introduces its real main character, ambitious young assistant DA Willie Beachum (Ryan Gosling). On his way out of the prosecutor's office to take a job with a high-priced law firm, a job he scammed his way into through nefarious means, Willie gets handed the Crawford case. Jennifer survived the shooting, so it seems like an open and shut case of attempted murder. They've got Crawford's gun and they've got a confession from him. But then it turns out the gun police took from Crawford isn't the murder weapon. And because Rob was involved in getting Ted's confession, that gets thrown out of court when Ted reveals Rob and Jennifer's affair in the middle of the trial.And there's the first twist, which I don't understand in the least. Neither Willie nor anyone else in the story knows about Jennifer and Rob's affair. But the audience knows about it and the audience knows that Ted knows about it. So, there's absolutely no doubt in any viewer's mind that at some point, Ted is going to spill the beans and destroy Willie's case. Which means when it happens, there's no emotional or dramatic impact to it at all. It's like waiting half an hour for someone to tell you the punch line to a joke you already know. And what makes this an especially egregious example of bad screen writing is that you can't help but think that if the audience hadn't already been shown the affair, if the motive for the shooting were left a mystery, it would have been a very effective and shocking development. It's like writers Daniel Pyne and Glenn Gers came up with a neat idea and then did everything in their power to destroy it.After Ted's ""revelation"", Willie's case goes in the crapper and Ted goes free. This sends Willie into a tailspin, which might have been interesting if the film had given the audience any reason to care about Willie, and ends with him ready to leave town after Ted has the plug pulled on the comatose Jennifer. Willie's DA boss shows up to lamely try and console him. When Willie asks how he can live with letting a man get away with murder, the DA corrects him that Ted was only tried for attempted murder.And the second those words are out of the DA's mouth, anyone with a functioning brain knows exactly what the second and final twist of Fracture will be. You know that Willie's going to find the evidence of Ted's guilt, Ted's going to taunt him with double jeopardy and Willie's going to tell him that only means Ted can't be tried for attempted murder again, but he can be charged and convicted for murder. Yet even though the viewer figures all that out in a few seconds, this film grinds on for another half hour before getting to it. How screenwriters Pyne and Gers didn't realize they blatantly spoiled their own twists is a question I can't answer. Maybe they're stupid. Maybe they were on drugs. Maybe they were trying to test how idiotic other people were. Whatever the reason, it wasn't good enough to justify this nonsense.Anthony Hopkins does a fine job in Fracture, as he almost always does, but after giving Ted a big build up, the script reduces him to something between supporting character and walk-on cameo. Billy Burke is okay as Rob but again, starts out as a significant character and then turns into little more than a paper weight after Willie joins the story. The icily pretty Rosamund Pike does all she can with an awful role. She plays Nicky Gardner, Willie's prospective boss at the high-priced law firm and Nicky is one of the most romantically moronic women in the history of cinema. After a 45 second conversation and one meaningful look, she falls so completely in love with Willie that she's willing to risk her own career to help him out. There are dogs down at the animal shelter two days away from being euthanized that are more discriminating with their affection.Fracture was obviously intended to be a star vehicle for Ryan Gosling, but it turns into a black hole because he has nothing to work with in the role of Willie. This guy is a void except for an inexplicable Southern accent.Fracture is one of those films that is so flawed you wonder how the heck it ever got made. I will admit that the way they explain the missing murder weapon is fairly clever. It's too bad that little trick couldn't have found its way into a much better movie.",Fracture

59,dwpollar,Good crime drama with good acting...,6,23 August 2009,"1st watched 8/1/2009 – 6 out of 10 (Dir-Gregory Hoblit): Good crime drama with good acting and good pace. This movie was hard to follow in the last half hour --- otherwise I would have given it a higher rating. The story is about a district attorney, played by Ryan Gosling, who is trying to get into a private firm but is handed one last case that gives him more than he really wants. The case concerns a rich man, played by Anthony Hopkins, who is seen killing his wife at the beginning of the movie, then confesses the crime but then represents himself pleading not guilty. The character ends up being a pretty smart fellow who is testing the DA to actually prove the guilt after covering up most of the evidence. The DA's competitive nature kicks and he won't drop the case for any reason despite the fact that it's causing him to lose his chances at the private firm position. Hopkins' character entices him(of course), which we've seen before in Hopkin's characterizations(aka. Silence of the Lambs) with his way of hitting him where he is most vulnerable. This keeps the movie interesting until the confusing last part. It's definitely good enough for me to recommend but they kind of put things together very quickly to sum things up with the movie and that didn't sit well with me. Otherwise, this was a well done courtroom drama and is worthy of watching.",Fracture
60,davispittman,Great movie!,9,16 April 2016,"Fracture is a very intelligent and well made thriller starring Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling. This film features fantastic acting, a very well written script, and killer direction. The good reviews this movie garnered are very well deserved! The dialogue is witty and clever. Hopkins kills it in his starring role, he is creepy, clever, calm and collected, and really knows how to drive a good line home. And as for Gosling, he was enjoyable and fitting for his role, he is handsome, smart, and determined, which was perfect for this role he plays. Rosumand Pike, one of my favorite (because of Gone Girl) is good too, her role isn't nearly as big or powerful as her Oscar nominated lead in Gone Girl, but she still makes good use of her camera time. This movie keeps you so interested throughout the entire thing! It's incredible how clever and slick this film is.

It is about infidelity, revenge, murder, and manipulation of the justice system.Both Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling act up a storm. Even if he did not intend it (or maybe he did), Hopkins had a Hannibal Lecter feel in his character. Ryan had his work cut out for him since Hopkins dominates every scene he was in. But Ryan more than held his own. The actor who played the cop Nunnaly, Billy Burke (from ""24""), was very hammy. Gosling's new boss, played by icy Rosamund Pike, was, for me, a useless character.

Hopkins decides to represent himself which leads to many tricks pulled out from under his sleeve, and which could ruin Gosling's career, and the arresting officer's life. It's marvelous the way Hopkins and Gosling play together, with Hopkins always one step ahead of him, kind of reminding me of the Hannibal Lecter/Jodie Foster relationship in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, in a way.

63,EUyeshima,Overly Tricky Plot Makes for Glib Entertainment Thanks Mainly to the Two Leads,5,17 September 2007,"There's a familiar bag of tricks at work in this 2007 courtroom-driven suspense thriller, and it goes beyond Anthony Hopkins' deliberate echo of Hannibal Lecter in his malevolently amusing performance as Ted Crawford, a wealthy and cuckolded industrial engineer. It involves the intricately plotted, marginally credible screenplay by Daniel Pyne and Glenn Gers, which reminds me of an old episode of Columbo. That's not necessarily a bad thing since those Sunday night shows could be entertaining whodunits, but the derivative veneer of this movie purposefully shortchanges logic for contrived twists. In fact, the central conceit of the film is that we know Crawford shot his beautiful, adulterous wife point blank. The film is really about how he plans to get away with it and how young Willie Beachum, an ambitious and unflagging assistant D.A. bucks the odds and seeks the truth in this case.Giving away any more is unnecessary, as director Gregory Hoblit is no stranger to the courtroom giving us the equally twist-infested Primal Fear eleven years ago. While the twists are not as pronounced here, they also don't feel as hard-earned here primarily because Crawford and Beachum feel more like archetypes than flesh-and-blood characters. This is where casting helps considerably since Hopkins can evince menace with minimal effort - a blank stare, veiled smirk, the delusion of befuddlement in the courtroom - before you can say The Silence of the Lambs. Impressive in last year's Half Nelson, Ryan Gosling plays Beachum in a likeably braggadocio manner with a heavy Southern accent and a variety of idiosyncratic tics. It is his character that goes through something of an arc from accepting a high-paying job at an exclusive private firm to a personal catharsis over his crusade for justice.The two principal actors are well matched in their scenes together, even though one is a virtual replay of the one between Hopkins and Jodie Foster in Lambs. The rest of the actors aren't given much leeway to provide any meaningful depth to their characters - David Strathairn, in a complete role reversal from this year's Bourne Ultimatum, as Beachum's moral conscience and current boss, D.A. Joe Labruto; Billy Burke particularly lackluster as the indiscreet detective caught in the middle; Embeth Davidtz making her precious few moments count as Crawford's dissatisfied wife Jennifer; and former Bond girl Rosamund Pike as Nikki Gardner, Beachum's boss at his new firm. Her romantic relationship with Beachum seems like a particularly absurd plot convenience given the impropriety of a senior partner bedding an associate.The twisty ending satisfies for the obvious reason but is tethered in legal precedents that seem strangely arbitrary (pardon the pun). As part of its set of extras, the 2007 DVD contains two alternatives to the final ending, both making the inevitable a more Baroque-level experience that borders on silly. The other deleted scenes are of marginal interest including two extended variations on the romantic coupling between Gardner and Beachum. While a trailer is included, there is surprisingly no commentary track from either the director or the two principals. For what it's worth, the film is a fun ride for the undemanding because a moment's thought afterward will inevitably spoil your memory of it.",Fracture
64,Enchorde,Good intelligent thriller,7,23 August 2009,"Recap: Ted Crawford's wife is cheating on him. And now he has set up his revenge, killing her. But he doesn't plan on going to prison for it and so he sets a chain of events in motion so that he can be tried and acquitted. But on the other side is William Beachum. A young and ambitious young prosecutor with his sights set on a prestigious private firm. But if he wants to land a position there he just can't lose.Comment: A surprisingly intense and engaging thriller despite that we know who did it all the time. But Anthony Hopkins could have crafted a career out of playing the manipulating mastermind and a lot of the movies intensity owes it to him. Especially his little smirk, very cunning and condescending, that says so much. Apart from another good performance from Hopkins this is a very good movie. Even if there rises some questions about some technical points both from a medical and legal standpoint it doesn't disturb the story as much as it would have other stories. But that may be due to Hopkins ability.Well, Hopkins isn't alone. I liked Gosling's character Beachum. Ambitious and very good at what he does. But he does also know when he has met his match. At the same time he wants out and begin both a new career and have a new relationship with Nikki, his potential new boss. Unfortunately this substory disappears as the movie progresses and doesn't have a satisfactory conclusion at all, I miss that. Especially since I thin Pike had something going with her character Nikki. Her and the relationship with Beachum promised more than it got the chance to deliver.Still it was a very engaging and captivating thriller. It kept my interest without problem during the entire run. An intelligent, well crafted (good cinematography) thriller that doesn't rely on action or blood, but is a battle between two bright minds. A fight more interesting than most with hands or guns.7/10",Fracture
65,dierregi,The evidence store,8,13 June 2017,"Finally a courtroom drama-psychological thriller with some substance. Hopkins is Ted Crawford, a malevolent, clever guy who prefers homicide to divorce. Gosling is Willy Beachum, a smug young lawyer on his way to a bright career in the private sector who ends up playing a cat and mouse game he could do without.Crawford shots his wife Jennifer, because she has an affair with Lt. Nunally, and Homicide cop and then sets a crazy plan in motion. Jennifer ends up in a coma and the distraught Nunally sort of looses it.I am not a Gosling fan, but contrary to most other reviewers I found his character strangely endearing. Maybe because of his integrity, a quality so rarely seen in modern day movies' characters. Willy' s smugness is mitigated by his determinationWilly sees Jennifer as a victim, not as somebody who ""had it coming"" and visits her at the hospital, hoping for a miracle recovery.What I found disturbing are the comments about Crawford deserving to get away with murder because he is clever. Some people must still have a hard on for Hannibal Lecter or think that a woman deserves to die if she is unfaithful - which is worrying.There are a few plot holes, the biggest being the affair between Jennifer and Nunally. In fact, the whole movie stands on the premise that Nunally is blissfully ignorant about Jennifer's identity. I found it weird that a Homicide cop did not try to find out who is lover was. It is very unlikely cop behavior, since she could have been linked to terrorism or crime and cops like to investigate.Anyway, the pace is fast but not frantic, with some luscious settings that do not hurt the eye and witty dialogues.

66,Samiam3,A fractured and mediocre thriller,6,3 September 2009,"I had some problems with Fracture. Everything I heard about it, promised a smart, non-conventional engaging thriller, which is not what I saw. It begins with a conventional murder. Ted Crawford is a wealthy suit in L.A. After discovering that his wife is cheating on him, he shoots her in cold blood. When the police arrive, strangely he gives them a signed confession, and he then offers to defend himself in court. The lawyer assigned to prosecute him is Willy Beachum, who has an impressive 97% conviction rate. At first he figures this case will be a piece of cake (seeing as they have a signed confession) but Crawford has some tricks up his sleeve. The movie becomes a battle between the two men as Willy tries to bring Ted down with the evidence he has, and Ted always finding a way to prove the evidence useless. Who is gonna win?It all sounds exciting, but it isn't really. The only times when Fracture really engages is during the eerie exchanges between Hopkins and Gosling, and there are only a few scenes like this. Fracture suffers from the 'too many characters' syndrome. There are more supporting characters than the film needs and their involvement in the story feels not only irrelevant but confusing (unless you are a lawyer). Fracture starts and ends like a thriller, and by ends, I mean it has a climactic twist. Unfortunately is it predictable from the start, so much so that I have some doubts in fact that the filmmakers intended this to be a twist. How dumb do they expect the audience to be.Whether or not you are fooled will depend on how much you focus on the movie. It keeps you're attention, but barely, and it never fully delivers. Therefore I would have to classify Fracture as overrated.",Fracture
67,triple8,a good though not great movie elevated because of Hopkins and Gosling.,7,22 November 2007,"SPOILERS:I really enjoyed Fracture though I did not think it was a 10. Since psychological thrillers are one of my favorite types of films, I have seen a lot of them. This would not fall among the best though not many really good ones have come out lately so it definitely makes an impact.Without getting into the details of the plot to much, here is what I liked about it. The film pits Gosling against Hopkins and their both among the most talented performers around. They share a screen really well together and I throughly enjoyed watching the cat and mouse game they indulged in. The movie also had a few surprises....just when you think you know exactly what is going to happen next, it sort of goes off in another direction. And Fracture is one of those films that keeps you glued to your seat. And I have to Say I have been sort of disappointed with 2007 in terms of new movies so it was great to see this type of film.But there was some things I did not like as well. First off, the movie does not tell you anything about Hopkin's character. One knows even less about His wife. One knows even less about their marriage. What kept her with him? Was he abusive? Had she loved him once and just fallen out of love? I have to say the film provides woefully little detail about major aspects of the movie.Then there is the fact that the audience knows from the beginning who the shooter is. I could not help thinking how much more genuinely suspenseful it would have been if we did not know for sure who did it. And the cat and mouse game as interesting as it is becomes a little repetitious. There is a feeling that the movie will end with Hopkins being found out because as the movie progresses his behavior gets more audacious and it is a rare movie that would end with him NOT having a final showdown with Gosling. So watching the movie, as interesting a movie as it is, also tries one's Patience at times because it becomes a series of near misses of Golsing trying to Bring Hopkins to justice. Even though some of the twists and turns do not go in the expected direction, as I mentioned earlier, there is something sort of predictable about the movie as a whole and something oddly repetitious about it.Then there's the romance between Gosling and the female lawyer. It didn't really serve a purpose and was kind of a distraction. This was such a good movie in a lot of ways.

I know that many viewers were very insightful and figured out the twists and the ending within first half of hour or so but I did not and I was impressed by the way the disappearance of the crucial evidence had been handled - very clever. Besides being an entertaining crime movie, the most interesting element of ""Fracture"" is a struggle of wills and intellects between two main characters, self-made inventor - millionaire Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) who shot his unfaithful wife in the face and put her in a coma and young, successful and smart assistant D.A. Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling), who has a 97% conviction rate and is assigned to prosecute Crawford just when he is ready to accept a lucrative offer from the prestigious LA law firm. The game of cat and mouse that highly intelligent and malevolent Crawford plays with Beachum makes the film interesting and the scenes between Hopkins (in his ""playful Dr. Lector"" mode) and Gosling (whose character does change as he realizes what he is dealing with from the unsympathetic self-centered hot shot to the man who becomes obsessed by the case, vows to put the murderer behind the bars and makes it his priority) - riveting and joy to watch. I also would like to mention David Strathairn as Willy's boss, DA Joe Lobuto in yet another understated effective performance. Strathairn's Lobuto is so interesting that he could be a main character in another move. ""Fracture"" is not perfect. For example, Willy's affair with Nikki Gardner (Rosamund Pike), a beautiful lawyer and his perspective boss was lifeless - they did not have any chemistry together. I think that Nikki's purpose in the movie was to introduce Willy to her father, a judge, whose help he would desperately need in one of the later scenes. I'd rather prefer more scenes between Willy and Crawford but even the way it was, the movie kept my attention all the way through and despite the rather weak ending, I found ""Fracture"" quite good.",Fracture

The idea is also handled pretty well I must say, the mystery stays compelling throughout and the ending is just surprising enough to warrant all the time you won't get back. Still, something seems lacking. Maybe it's the fact that Anthony Hopkins isn't really in this movie enough, the focus is pretty much solely on Ryan Gosling even though his character is far less interesting. Who gives a damn about this D.A's personal troubles, or about his largely interchangeable co-workers? All these little B-stories (a love interest, how original) are just pretty lame and add very little to the proceedings. Furthermore, there's an important plot point in the second half (I can't be too specific) that just seems totally crammed in.

80,leftbanker-1,Fun but Kind of Stupid,7,11 April 2015,"Spoiler Alert!!! OK, I'll admit that it was fun, fun but stupid which really isn't my kind of fun. The entire movie was premised on how the killer was able to hide the gun he used to kill his wife, as if the case solely depended on this detail. The young, hotshot assistant D.A. didn't seem to bother himself with a motive which would have led him to her lover and the huge crack he had in his case. And did the guy really have to be a hostage negotiator? They could have made him out to be a regular cop and it would have been a lot more believablebut then they wouldn't have had the pretense of him giving up his gun (which was also pretty stupid as a cop would never do this, at least not by regulation). As soon as I saw the body with the gun I figured out that he switched gunsnot that this was so diabolically clever as they made it out to be. If all he needed to do was to hide the gun there are a million better ways he could have done this. He could also have thought of about a bazillion better ways to do away with his wife and her lover but that the stuff of other thrillers.And why, oh why would the lover-cop shoot himself in the courthouse stairwell? At first I thought the wife-killer offed him somehow which would have made at least a little bit of sense.Good acting, as you would expect from the stars of this film and that is what made it worth a watch. I also applaud that fact that the star didn't kill the killer in the end.",Fracture

82,seymourblack-1,"Mystery, Mind Games & Enormous Egos",8,12 October 2018,"Mind games play a big part in this superior mystery thriller that entertains by the quality of its story, some unpredictable developments and the dual that it neatly sets up between a couple of very arrogant men who both happen to believe that they can easily outwit the other. The mystery at the heart of the story is swiftly set up and what follows is presented with great clarity, a satisfying pace and a level of tension that builds up steadily throughout. The whole production is very slick and stylish and also features a score that perfectly complements the mood of the piece.Aeronautical engineer Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) is a meticulous man whose speciality is identifying the weak spots in the complicated structures and systems that he works with on a daily basis. When he discovers that his wife is having an affair, he coolly goes home to his mansion, shoots her in the head at point-blank range and then immediately burns his clothes, washes himself thoroughly and rearranges the crime scene before waiting patiently for the police to arrive. LAPD Detective Lieutenant Rob Nunally (Billy Burke) is first on the scene and as a trained hostage negotiator, quickly defuses a potentially dangerous situation by establishing a one-to-one dialogue with Ted. Nunally is surprised when Ted readily admits to his crime but is even more shocked to discover that the victim is his lover. Ted is promptly arrested and charged with attempted murder while Jennifer Crawford (Embeth Davidtz) is hospitalised and slips into a coma.Assistant D.A. Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling), is a hotshot prosecutor with a 97% conviction rate and is working out his notice in his current job so that he can leave shortly to join a private law firm and collect the very generous salary he's been offered. Despite the limited time he has left to spend at the D.A.'s office, he agrees to prosecute the case against Ted because with a signed confession having been made, Ted's gun having been recovered by the police and a defendant who's chosen to defend himself in court, it promises to be another easy win for this glory-hunting lawyer.When the case is brought to trial, everything seems to proceed normally until Ted informs the court about Nunally's affair with Jennifer. This information compromises the confession that Nunally was involved in taking, especially as Ted claims that he signed it under duress. Furthermore, when a ballistics report confirms that the gun recovered from Ted's mansion hadn't been fired, the whole trial becomes a farce and Willy's left facing the humiliation of being involved in such a shambles. With his current job, his future job and his reputation all in jeopardy, he becomes desperate to find sufficient evidence to bring Ted to justice in a way that won't be impeded by the legal provisions around double jeopardy.Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling make marvellous adversaries as both their characters are undone at certain junctures by their enormous egos which lead them into complacency and a lack of attention to detail. Hopkins' character knows that everybody has a weak spot and having identified Willy's, plays the kind of mind games that he knows will really get under the lawyer's skin. An unintended consequence of Willy's dual with Ted is the way that certain things that happen, compel him to reconsider what it is about his work that's genuinely important and also how far he's prepared to go in order to secure a conviction.The mystery of how Ted sets up what seems a perfect murder is intriguing and engaging throughout and the moral dilemmas that Willy faces add further interest. Ted's idiosyncrasies are a constant source of amusement and also contribute to the sheer comedy value of what takes place when the entire case against him collapses. There's a great deal to enjoy in this above-average thriller that's less predictable than most and definitely worth watching.",Fracture

86,jaredmobarak,Helpless actually  Fracture,7,5 September 2009,"""Think of yourself,"" says David Strathairn's DA Joe Lobruto. To which Willie Beachum replies, ""I've done enough of that."" It is a great exchange towards the end of the film that expresses beautifully the mind set of this young hotshot attorney, thinking he could sleepwalk through his last case in the public sector before jumping ship to the lucrative private one. Ryan Gosling is the kind of actor that can pull off the confidence of a man on top of the world, while also the haunted one that realizes the dire consequences of his actions, bringing that moral core back out, the one that got him into the business in the first place. Fracture is a film that examines the fall from grace of intellectuals who believe they are above the law. Between Gosling's Beachum's careless thinking that he could watch a case implode and just walk away and Anthony Hopkins' Ted Crawford, the man on trial for murdering his wife, thinking he's crafted the perfect crime, we as an audience see what hubris is and how humbling defeat can be. The only difference is that one of these men has a chance to redeem himself—it's just a matter of whether he will.The script utilized by director Gregory Hoblit, (the man behind a favorite of mine, Fallen), brings him back to the courtroom, a locale that seems to suit him well. His attachment to ""L.A. Law"" has reaped some Emmy awards and a couple of his previous films include Hart's War and the taut gem Primal Fear, so courtroom drama is definitely a strength. Fracture's screenplay thinks it's more clever than it is, but the writing and strong dialogue help alleviate that problem by engrossing you in the tale, cloaking its true twists longer than should perhaps be the case. His direction, on-the-other-hand, is on its game, garnering two great performances from both Gosling and Hopkins, utilizing a supporting cast with some big talent well, (although I do have to agree with the criticism I remember hearing when the film came out concerning Rosamund Pike—she is beautiful and a good actress, but did she really have to be American with that horrid accent?), and some nice visual flourishes. The murder scene at the center of everything is beautifully shot and blocked, using reflections any chance it can: loved the frame of Hopkins and Embeth Davidtz looking at each other, one clear and the other behind glass, enjoyed the glimpse of Hopkins in the pool of blood on the floor, and thought the reflection of the credits in the glass marbles shooting through the cool spiral contraption was a nice touch.After those moments of artistic flair, though, the film settles into a standard courtroom drama, heavy on acting and expression, both facial and body language. Hopkins is playing a game, looking to get under the skin of everyone involved with the case to deflect the truth and ruin the lives of those who hurt him. His constant provoking of Gosling is a delight as he does his best to distract him, anger him, and allow him to take himself out of the case. Seeing this young kid show up at his arraignment in a tuxedo couldn't have been more perfect; here was a guy with the proverbial one foot out the door, here is a guy already so distracted that he won't have to work too hard, just a little push should be all that's necessary. The courtroom does become a bit of a circus with revelations being brought to light at inopportune times, but that just adds to the show being put on. The bigger it is, the louder and more boisterous it becomes, only widens Hopkins' smile, accompanying it with that subtle little wink saying, ""thanks for playing"".There are conveniences for sure, especially Pike's boss/love interest, serving only as a way to keep the MacGuffin that is Gosling's awaiting job at Wooten Sims as well as a connection to her father, one that helps amp the tension of a scene crucial to the outcome, yet who's appearance is very brief. But, truthfully, aren't all films convenient to a point? The real success of a script comes from the ability to make those instances seem real and necessary. Life is a sequence of accidents and coincidences that build on each other to propel us forward into the future. The strength of the writing plugs some plot holes and allows the audience to go with the flow and believe that this aeronautical engineer had it all planned out to be foolproof. And both our leads are just plain fun to watch, one becoming more and more confident as the other falls deeper and deeper into frustration.I use the quote I do for the title of this review because it is an appropriate truth that comes out when Davidtz's character asks Hopkins if being so smart makes him feel powerful. His reply of, ""no, helpless actually,"" couldn't be more true. The knowledge that those you deal with can't understand concepts so simple to yourself is frustrating; the inability to just speak shorthand and be understood leaves one helpless because one can only go at the speed of the slowest person in the equation. However, on the flipside to that, when you are the only one included in the problem, your intellect becomes power because your speed is faster than those on the other end. Hopkins has but one opponent able to bring him down, yet Gosling's drive and need to win is assumed to be too much to make him matter. The question becomes whether greed or justice propels that drive and, if provoked, whether the sleeping beast could be awakened out of pride and moral fortitude. A lawyer with morals you ask? That never happens  does it?",Fracture

One of the pleasures of this movie is seeing the two main actors battling it out.

It goes without saying that the production values are super high.It's not spoiler at all to say that Hopkins isn't the good guy. The movie is set up like a Columbo episode, in which you're shown the crime in the very beginning and then events play out to see if justice will prevail.Instead of being a big-time Hollywood release, ""Fracture"" seems like it could simply have been a well-done TV movie. A lot of stuff that's been done by HBO, for instance, not to mention even the major over-the-air networks, is probably superior. I don't feel terrible about the time I lost to it, but I would have chosen something else if I knew how unexceptional it was.One bit I found really entertaining was when a female boss came on super strong to a male subordinate and the movie makes it seem perfectly OK. Even though these were physically attractive individuals, it seemed really weird given today's very touchy ""#metoo"" times, but then I guess a lot of stuff in older films could never be done again. Reverse the male and female roles, and people would have been hitting the ceiling, probably even back when this was made.All in all, there's nothing special about ""Fracture"", but if you kill a lot of time with thrillers, I suppose this will probably work for you.",Fracture

I, on the other hand, found Fracture to be, for the most part, a thoroughly engrossing film, with two excellent performances at its center.Sure, there are several things in the course of the unfolding of the story that didn't add up, and upon reflection afterwards, there were a few more. This isn't a perfect film. But it didn't telegraph (at least not to me) in an obvious or heavy-handed way where it was going with the plot, and it didn't have a clear-cut good/bad character distinction between Hopkins, as the full-of-himself wronged husband, Ted, and Gosling's equally-full-of-himself slick lawyer, Willy. In fact, up until a certain point in the film (where Gosling's character chooses not to do something that would have been supremely unethical just so he could win the case), most viewers would probably be rooting for Hopkins' character. I think it's very tricky to create that sort of response from an audience, and Hopkins manages to pull this off with hardly any fanfare whatsoever, although a couple of times I almost thought he was going to make that sleazy-yet-somehow-seductive liver-sucking sound.The film also leaves enough for us as the audience to figure out for ourselves, which I always appreciate, although in this case, ironically, the more you think about it, the more seemingly obvious plot holes come to mind. In this way, the movie lives up to its title in a way that I don't really think was planned. Then again, maybe it was, and the film makers get the last laugh.",Fracture

However, things are not as they seem and Crawford proves to be a very manipulative opponent who looks like he in on a clear path in getting away with murder one.From the setup to the conclusion ""Fracture"" is a nice twist on the murder mystery genre. The irony here is that the problem young Beachum has is not finding the killer from a list of suspects, but trying to get a confessed murder proved guilty. There is not too much legal mumbo jumbo and the series of technicalities and legal twists and turns prove very interesting, even for the casual mystery viewer. Also, of note is the lack of violence with the focus being almost solely plot and clever character development. The fighting between the Beachum and Crawford is all about wits and nerves.In addition to the legal thriller aspect there is an interesting look at the young hotshot archetype. Beachum, pretty much full of himself in the beginning of the film goes through an arc where he learns from an elder, but this elder just so happens to be his enemy, Crawford.Overall, this is a very good non-violent thriller that deserves to be put on the shelf next to ""Double Indemnity."" --- 8/10Rated R despite minimal violence and limited profanity",Fracture
93,jpschapira,A lesson,6,5 October 2007,"Just as actors like Colin Farrell learn from actors like Al Pacino in movies like ""The Recruit"", actors like Ryan Gosling learn from actors like Anthony Hopkins in movies like ""Fracture"". These movies might me good or not, but you have to watch them to feel the contrast and to see if by any chance the hot shot could surpass the pro.It's just a way of saying, the hot shot. Ryan Gosling is a very accomplished actor with an impeccable career so far, but in ""Fracture"" he plays Willy Beachum, a hot shot lawyer that gets this case: a man has shot his wife and made a statement admitting it, but he now says he's innocent and wants to represent himself. Who's this guy? It doesn't matter; he's played by Anthony Hopkins.Is ""Fracture"" an excuse to show Hopkins and Gosling showing off? It should be, because David Strathairn is part of the film and he passes the whole ride unnoticed. It also should be, because the screenplay is so predictable that you really need to like the performances to watch the movie until the end once you've discovered the 'twist', if you can call it that.There's also a television feeling through the film I didn't expect from Gregory Hoblit. The director, who gave us two solid films this decade (""Frequency"" and ""Hart's War""), seems tired and unwilling to work hard. Pay attention to the way he gives the clues away; he uses the easiest methods and he doesn't risk at all. Of course he's helped by the fact that we know what really happened from the beginning, but that's no excuse; also considering the fact that he's work with law before.And what happened really? A man killed his wife and we don't like him for it. We like him even less when Hopkins plays him as a sadistic, intelligent and ironic guy who's mocking the system with what he has done. ""You have to be nice to me because what's left of a life depends on a plugAnd I decide when it gets pulled"", he tells Willy in one of the few nerve-wracking scenes of the film.We usually want things to change and we want the good guy to lose because we get tired of watching him win, but ""Fracture"" causes an unstoppable desire of wanting the bad guy to pay for his sins, even when there's nothing better than Anthony Hopkins getting away with it. Whether the movie complies with our desire is not important, but the whole thing in the middle.Hopkins is a master of his art, and everything here is one of his lessons. Gosling is fantastic, that's for sure, but I don't know if he would have achieved the same with another actor beside him. You can find the same contrast in ""Red Dragon"", where Hopkins teaches Edward Norton; or in the brilliant ""Instinct, where he shows Cuba Gooding Jr. some kind of meaning of life.",Fracture

Ryan Gosling (""Drive"") makes for a nice good guy , even if he obviously had much better performances in his career. Rosamund Pike (""Die another day"") is solid as the love interest. The rest of the cast is also doing a good job.The movie has a nice pacing thanks to Gregory Hoblit (""Primal fear"") confident direction. It's also nice to hear fairly interesting dialogues (the dialogue about the eggs is great and explains the title of the movie).The movie also wants to be a morality story about a guy who learns to care about other people . It's done pretty well without being preachy.Sadly with all of this good stuff in ""Fracture"" I can't rate it too highly. For most of it's time it's a solid thriller. The cat and mouse game between Hopkins and Gosling is engaging and I don't even mind the slightly forced love story between Gosling and Pike. There are two questions that keep the viewer interested : What happened to the gun and who will win in the end ? The answer to the first question is logical , surprising and sly. However , the answer to the second question The movie loses any creditability in the last 20 minutes. The are 2 major events that are completely absurd and unrealistic , yet the need to happen because otherwise the screenwriter wouldn't be able to finish the story with happy end. The suicide of police officer is completely out of character for him ( especially considering his aggressive behavior towards Hopkins early and TWICE in the movie). I am supposed to believe that he would kill himself rather than Hopkins ?! The second event is the fact that Hopkins decided to kill his wife ( who was in coma and didn't had any chance to wake up) , so he was able to get very quickly and without no problem a positive answer from the hospital to do euthanasia. He was able also to get warrant for Gosling to keep away from his wife. What ?! A guy that just has been cleared of murder charges in controversial case is able in less than day to do this all ?! On what charge would Gosling even receive the warrant to keep away from Hopkins wife ? He was guilty of reading her poetry ?! What is worse those 2 stupid events are NECESSARY for the writer so he could come up with the happy ending involving bullet , murder charge and double jeopardy .

This was a very good psychological thriller, satisfying the high expectations I had.As glamorized about the previews, the film is about a wealthy engineer Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) who shoots his wife in the face. He is prosecuted by a young hot shot Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling) who holds a 97% conviction rate, and is only a single step from being an official member of a prominent law firm. However, the game the old man has planned is far more challenging than Willy had ever thought of.The acting between the two leads, Hopkins and Gosling were simply brilliant. Hopkins still has his cunning ""Hannibal Lector"" charm and persuasion. I've only seen Ryan Gosling in one other film ""The Notebook"", and I have to say he's a young star who has a strong future in Hollywood. The rest of the supporting cast was quite supportive, including the lovely Rosamund Pike and bold David Strathain.The direction by Gregory Hoblet was equally as brilliant, from the great up-close captures of the character's faces to the distant aerial shots of L.A. The other technical works including: editing, sound, and cinematography were also well done.But the best part of the film was the moral. As Hopkins' character describes in a scene to Gosling's character that he once lived on a farm, and his job was to sort all the eggs to make sure they were all perfect and unscratched. But he found a flaw in each one. The moral is that everything has a breaking point and Hopkins warns Gosling's character his breaking point.Now, the story holds strong with several twists, turns, and wonders that make you think throughout the film, until the last half hour. The film then drags and delivers a rather fictitious ending (which I will not spoil) that was very predictable and corny. You'll have to see the ending for yourself.Other than that, I really enjoyed this film; it satisfied most of my needs for a good thriller. It had great acting, a solid story for a thriller till the end, good humor, and an adequate pace. But to another disappointment, I wished this film was a PG-13. The violence was only in two scenes, and not too graphic, and there were occasional f-bombs. What's up with that? Overall rating 4/5 See it if you got the chance.",Fracture
98,vostf,Elaborate Colombo-like Clue game,6,14 July 2009,"Basically this is just another movie built around a plot-device: like a whodunit it wants badly to be clever for about 90min before delivering the answer to the plot. The device: ""What exactly viciously intelligent Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) has planned to challenge Justice?"" How it ends doesn't really matter since we learn this: this is the big problem of the device-oriented plots. As in a whodunit, the device should be no more than a mcguffin but it keeps growing as the focal point of the story, at the expense of the main characters and their duel.On the plus side Fracture displays great production values, and with two very good leads given fine dialogue, the movie keeps our interest up to the end. I especially found that the dialogue between Crawford and his wife was wonderful. Unfortunately the movie them jumps avidly in its bigger (actually grosser while trying to be smarter) than life concept. The concept, like a whodunit, prevents the main characters from becoming really interesting. Anthony Hopkins does his routine, too fantastically close to Hannibal for the movie to be rooted in reality, while Brian Goslink is too mundane in comparison. One appears too clever, the other too young to let us expect more than a bang to bump the plot forward. At least with Colombo the audience knows the police only plays dumb.Bottom line: well-made Clue game that doesn't avoid the pitfall of letting its plot-device tell the story (""how does he expect to get away with it?"") at the expense of its premise (cat and mouse game between suspect and prosecutor).",Fracture

I had seen the trailer of this movie and with the type of coverage given to Anthony Hopkins in the trailer; I became keener to jump on the opportunity to see the movie.Anthony Hopkins plays Ted Crawford who shoots his wife because she is sleeping with someone  a policeman played by David Strathairm. An ambitious and confident lawyer Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling) takes this clear and shut case easily. But later realizes that the weapon with which the wife is killed in missing and Ted Crawford could be set free  innocent without any charge. Ted fights his own case and wins. But Willy does not leave the case and in the end solves the mystery and brings Ted back into the courtroom. Whether Ted is convicted this time is not shown in the movie  but the movie ends there.Director Gregory Hoblit, has tried his best to bring two great stars together  one veteran and one rising; one old wine and one young spirit. Anthony Hopkins as usual gives his best performance; he speaks more in his silences than when he actually speaks and that is the class of his caliber and acting. Ryan Gosling is good, and holds his feet against Anthony Hopkins, but still looks tiny.There is a love angle to Ryan in the movie  which is totally unnecessary. This and some other scenes are so loose in the movie that they carry unnecessary & extra film footage.I was able to guess the mystery just 20 minutes into the movie and I think, that is the failure of the Director  to have such a predictable mystery. More unsatisfactory was the way Ryan Gosling brings back Anthony Hopkins to the court room in the end. It is so much laughable. I felt like I was seeing some old Bollywood blockbuster  where a very intelligent villain always holds his mind till the end and like a fool blurts out his crimes without reasons to the Hero, just to be arrested. Did not the Director realize this decades old formula and not to repeat it? Other point is that as shown in the trailers  Sir Anthony Hopkins does not really get enough scenes and movie revolves around Ryan Gosling. I was disappointed at that. I am giving 5 points just because of Sir Anthony Hopkins, otherwise the rating would be much more lower.(Stars 5 out of 10)",Fracture

105,nicholls_les,Great movie but the ending didn't work for me,7,13 October 2016,"This is over all a good movie and the acting especially by Mr Hopkins is very good indeed.Wealthy, brilliant, and meticulous Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins), is a structural engineer in Los Angeles, he shoots his wife and plans to entrap her lover Lt. Rob Nunally (Billy Burke) who is the investing police officer, I have to say how this is done so if you don't want to know, don't read on. Crawford signs a confession; and then at the arraignment, he asserts his rights to represent himself and asks the court to move immediately to trial. The prosecutor Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling), is a hotshot lawyer who is soon to join a fancy civil-law firm. He is told by everyone it's an open and shut case. Crawford sees Beachum's weakness, the hairline fracture of his character:For me the ending does not work for this reason. Crawford earlier switched his gun for the Policeman, Lt.Nunally who is having an affair with his wife. Then after shooting her, he lets Nunally in and while he is distracted after seeing his dying lover, Crawford switches the guns back, so that Nunally now has the murder weapon and walks out with it. This now leaves the Police with no murder weapon at the house, as the other gun shows it has not been recently fired. (all good so far)At the Trial Crawford reveals that Nunally had been having an affair with his wife and had forced the confession out of him. With no evidence the judge is forced to acquit Crawford. (Still all good) Nunally then shots himself.Prosecutor Willy Beachum does not want to give up and towards the end realises the gun switch and arrests Crawford (Double Jeopardy doesn't apply as he was initially charged with attempted murder, but since his wife died after Crawford had her life support switched off it is now a different charge of Murder)However the problem I have is that all Beachum can prove is that Nunally 's gun was used to shoot the wife. He cannot prove that Crawford switched the guns and the CCTV footage from the motel where the guns were switched does not clearly show Crawford or a gun switch.So it could be argued that Lt.Nunally shot Crawfords wife. He had the murder weapon and opportunity but nothing tied Crawford to the murder weapon. Nunally had even earlier tried to convince Beachum that he could plant the murder weapon on Crawford's property, which would also make him seem guilty and trying to frame Crawford.So if you watch this movie I would be interested to know if you feet the same way?",Fracture
106,the-movie-guy,A psychological thriller that will take you to the breaking point,8,19 April 2007,"(My Synopsis) Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins), a methodical structural engineer, plans a systematic way to kill his younger wife, Jennifer (Embeth Davidtz), when he discovers that she is having an affair with a police negotiator. Crawford has logically figured a way to kill his wife and involve hostage negotiator Detective Rob Nunally (Billy Burke) into his plan. After Crawford shoots his wife, the police arrive and he allows only the negotiator, Detective Nunally, to enter the house. Crawford admits to shooting his wife and that she is lying on the floor in the other room. Detective Nunally checks Jennifer out to see if she is still alive, and then he recognizes that she is his lover. Jennifer was shot in the head, but she is not dead. Detective Nunally is able to overpower Crawford and put him under arrest. Crawford is arraigned and wants an immediate trial, acting as his own lawyer. With a signed confession and the gun, the Assistant District Attorney Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling) believes he has a slam-dunk case and agrees to go to trial. What Beachum thought was a perfectly simple case ends up being a battle of wits and a psychological fight that takes him to his breaking point.(My Comment) The story is a suspenseful thriller, about a very clever and demented person who believes he can outwit the police, district attorney, and the court with his superior intellect. Anthony Hopkins does a terrific job of being that person who can actually get away with murder. Ryan Gosling did a fine job of acting and held his own when he had screen time with Hopkins. The trial becomes a battle of the minds between Crawford and Beachum. Hopkins acts like he doesn't know the law, but he uses all the technicalities that a seasoned attorney would use to dismiss all the evidence against him. I would have liked a little more courtroom time in the movie. I know that some of the audience was able to figure out what happened to the gun before Beachum figures it out at the end. Note: the writers should have contacted the District Attorney's office before writing the last scene, because they got it wrong; even though I'm not an attorney, I know that it really would be considered double jeopardy.

Hopkins does a good job as always. No one plays the intelligent homicidal maniac better (or creepier) than him.
Gosling on the other hand is completely wrong for this part. His character is too young and smug to be likeable. I was actually rooting for Hopkins to beat him.
The rest of the characters are also unlikable. The wife is a cheater and so is the cop. I didn't get any good vibes from either one of them. As a viewer I expect to feel sympathy for the victim. I didn't. Nikki is too much of an ice queen and as other reviewers mentioned, hard to believe a lawyer like her would jump straight into bed with someone coming to work for her, let alone bring him to Thanksgiving dinner with her family. Seriously who would do that?
As for the mystery of ""where is the murder weapon"", it was obvious to me right from the start. So really, no mystery there. The ending was unoriginal. It felt fake and forced. All throughout the movie the Ryan Gosling character was all about winning and moving on to a comfortable higher paying job but now all of a sudden it's about justice? Not buying it.

Still, you probably won't mind, it's too well done as a whole. I found Gosling's Beachum easy to root for and quite recognizable. Hopkins as Ted Crawford is downright mesmerizing at times. Once again, it's amazing what someone like Hopkins can do for a movie. Every bit as important was the direction by Gregory Hoblit who's apparently come a long way since 'Fallen' and 'Primal Fear' and his early days in TV.

This film, however, feels like a conglomeration of a number of interesting elements from other films. The battle of wits that transpire between this film makes ""Primal Fear"" a quick and easy comparison, although the presence of Anthony Hopkins opens up that Hannibal Lecter can of worms. Unfortunately the battle of wits here is misdirected, because Hopkin's character has his bone to pick with the lover and not the young attorney. The bulk of the game playing occurs in relationship to the court case, and makes the film more about holes in the legal system, but that's not really how it's presented.""Fracture"" is one of those pretzel-like movies that make for good entertainment, but rarely add up or have much impact upon later review.

It features a few good performances although they are working with some unremarkable material and can't quite lift the film above mediocrity. The uninspired direction was a bit surprising given the track record of director Gregory Hoblit. He managed to keep things safe and predictable without really adding anything special to the film. I guess he was relying on the strength of his cast which only worked to an extent. The scenes with Gosling and Hopkins were interesting to watch but whenever Hopkins was absent, the film seriously dragged and Gosling's character was really unlikable so it was hard to root for him.The screenplay was only average with some decent dialog being the highlight of it. The way the screenwriter played out the crime was very formulaic and pretty predictable. The ending was fairly obvious from the beginning and it wasn't a big twist ending that makes the viewer feel smart for figuring it out but rather it was an ending that makes the viewer wonder how these supposedly smart characters weren't able to figure it out. So save for some scenes with Gosling and Hopkins, the audience gets to watch a bland story unfold without any real sense of interest.Luckily, the casting director did a great job and the performances were able to save the film. Anthony Hopkins was playing a familiar character yet it was still great to watch him on screen and he was the best part about the movie. Ryan Gosling was also pretty good and he managed to keep up with Hopkins. Rosamund Pike was decent, a bit dry though. I really liked Embeth Davidtz and it's such a shame that she didn't get a lot of screen time although this was expected.

It is a totally deadpan drama, but it has a huge amount of charm on a fairly small budget. Hopkins' Ted is thoroughly enjoyable and while the Welshman fairly sleeps through his role, that is the measure of the pro he is. Gosling does extremely well portraying cocky arrogance tempered with vulnerability when difficulties start to become serious obstacles.The script is extremely sharp, and the direction surprisingly fast paced for a drama.The only flaw is the love story which basically doesn't ring true nor does it add anything to the movie.

As the audience, there is no mystery to what Ted does and we discover that Ted is a manipulative criminal who is very crafty and thinks through his action. After the crime is committed, there is very little proof or evidence to show Ted's dark nature or prove that he committed the crime.Our other lead character is a young lawyer 'Willy' (played by Ryan Gosling). Willy is climbing up the ranks in his career and on the right patch to achieving great success... until he meets an unlikely opponent in the courtroom. When taken to court, Ted (Hopkins) refuses a lawyer and wishes to represent himself in the courtroom. It is up to Willy to try and prosecute Ted.The film tells the story of these two men in a roller coaster mystery as we see the truth unfold and view many tough choices, in particular for Willy's character. Willy is given two different paths: choose what's best for his career or what is simply right...The greatest strength in this film, hands down, is when Ted (Anthony Hopkins) and Willy (Ryan Gosling) are on screen at the same time and watching Ted continually play mind games with Willy (Gosling) from the word go. Also, remember that this was a film before Ryan Gosling's career seriously took off. The only film I can recall seeing Ryan Gosling in before Fracture was ""The Notebook"" (which is a different film to talk about on another day!). Even in his early days, this film shows that Ryan Gosling was going to be a strong actor. The film itself is also very dark. Given the director's history (Gregory Hoblit) this is something is to simply be expected (previously directed Fallen, Primal Fear, Frequency & Hart's War).Overall, Facture is a great crime thriller with added amounts of Drama. The Mystery alone kept me wanting to see the film's ending, because, at times, you just weren't sure which way the film was going to end. Once you know the film's ending it will be hard to have a strong experience again. The film's ending does feel a little rushed and I wonder if the director had other ideas but struggled himself with deciding how to end it.7.4/10

Surely if you want someone dead you shoot them at least twice and check to see they actually are dead. He also completely fails to see that he is being tried for attempted murder and if his wife later dies then the double jeopardy ruling will not protect him, although I'm not clear on the law here because he didn't actually murder her by turning off life support, or did he?Given that he also had time and means to completely destroy the murder weapon (he is after all an engineer with access to tools and chemicals) why even bother to risk swapping guns with a detective who he had no idea would turn up at the scene or interview him. It's all a bit wishy-washy, fairytale stuff.I'm always amazed at how complicated film murder plots can get, and this is surely one of the most complicated. Best to shoot someone with a silenced gun, preferably in a remote spot, and either destroy all evidence before reporting them missing or preferably destroy the body with fire or acid, or feed it to some hungry animals.Having said all that, I like a good murder mystery and perfect murders don't usually make for lengthy or interesting viewing. Some effort was made to create an entertaining movie, and maybe the gaping plot holes make it more entertaining, but to most intelligent people this is a bit of a dogs' dinner.",Fracture

Unfortunately, he is now accepting being in type casting because this movie is nothing but Lector (under a different name and occupation). But take away the fava beans and its still Lector under new circumstances. I guess everyone is entitled to make money, no matter how they use their talents to do it.This time he's a snotty SOB engineer accused of trying to kill his wife by the snotty SOB detective who has been having sex with her. The directing is pretentious as if this is a much more important movie than it is, the actors are too conscious of their movements, thinking their performances are more important than they are. All because they are working with Hopkins and they know they are in the presence of a great actor.Having said all that, Hopkins is so good that you ARE interested in the movie. With all its flaws, you DO want to see Lector defending himself in court, with all the psycho idiosyncrasies, like an animal twirling about getting himself out of traps even if he has to gnaw off his own foot to do it.So yes, it is worth the watching, for Hopkins/Lector Lovers.

True to chilling Hopkins form, the character he plays is no emotional silly; he asks for hostage negotiator Detective Rob Nunally (Billy Burke, who played the handsome stooge perfectly), the guy his wife was having an affair with. Nunally never knew the true identity of his lover till then and so is shocked at the splattered sight of his beloved.In comes golden boy Willy Beachum (brilliantly played by Ryan Gosling), the assistant district attorney who is on the verge to transferring to a cushy corporate job. He takes this last case, making the mistake of thinking that he could easily win against Crawford. Beachum finds himself going head to head in a battle of wits with the methodically mysterious Crawford, who exercises his gift at spotting people's weaknesses, much to Beachum's chagrin.The deft direction by Gregory Hoblit (Frequency, Hart's War) matched the intelligently spartan screenplay by Daniel Pyne (Sum of All Fears, The Manchurian Candidate, Any Given Sunday); they both let the wonderful acting by the cast shine through with minimal albeit biting dialogue.Also worth mentioning is the on screen sizzle lent by icy blonde beauty Rosamunde Pike (most known for playing Miranda Frost in Die Another Day), who plays Beachum's love interest and superior in his imminent transfer to his new job. For a small supporting role, she was really able to make each scene her own by her sheer presence.Gosling, while not extremely good looking, was perfect for the role. He was able to stand his own against Hopkins, had chemistry with his leading lady but it was his irresistibly roguish charm that went a long way in upping his likability factor.Fracture is just one of those rare gems of a flick where every element clicks.",Fracture
132,freaky_dave,"Good acting by the leads, but everything else was boring",6,21 April 2007,"The movie Fracture was a crime movie and played as a game of cat and mouse between an assistant DA (Ryan Gosling) and a manipulative man name Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) who is charged with killing his wife who was having an affair. The two leads were superb, but the storyline was weak and the pacing ever so slow.Ted Crawford (Hopkins) is a millionaire who one day discovers his wife is having an affair with a detective. More disappointed then angry, he confronts her at home and shoots her in the face, putting her in a coma. The detective who was having the affair with the wife comes to the crime scene where Crawford confronts him and tells him that he has shot his wife.Once in court, Crawford becomes his own attorney, and discovers that the prosecutor trying his case is a young assistant DA name Willie Beachum (Gosling) who has a perfect record in convictions. Beachum doesn't want the case at first because he is about to move up in the world, but decides to take it when it appears as if it will be an easy conviction. However the gun that was used in the shooting can't be found, and so the game is on between both men. One who is trying to gain his freedom, and another who wants to put the killer behind bars.Both actors were great, and it's too bad that the rest of the movie's pacing and storyline couldn't hold up. Included in the story is a lame affair between Gosling's character and his new boss to be named Nikki (Rosamund Pike.) It never really works, but I guess the movie had to have a love interest.There were also no real surprises and no real shocking twists, other than how the murder weapon disappeared from the crime scene. That twist with the weapon was all right, but other than that, this movie offered nothing new.I really wanted to like this movie because I liked both actors, but even their performances can't make up for all the other boring stuff that we as the viewers had to struggle through to get to the finale. The finale was nothing spectacular, but I won't dare spoil it for anybody who wants to see it. If I were the moviegoer, I would go and see this at the matinée instead.

It is up to Willy Beachum to find the evidences and there is Ted trying to make some excuses to escape conviction. What are the twists? Beachum trying to find evidences but could not be trusted and Ted made them not possible. With the time running short, Beacum must find the evidences as if he does not find them, Ted would be released. So here is him trying to find them, at the same time he meets a attorney which he likes. Willy Beachum is a proud guy who always thinks he can handle cases, he always says ""Don't worry!"" and he thinks he can find the hidden evidences. Come to the last part, for the last time in court where if he could not find them, Ted would be freed, he had no confidence and lost to him. Ted Crawford is one tricky guy, you don't want him on your case. He can twist all the evidences, makes the evidences given sound like they are not possible. In the end, guess what will outcome? One thing I don't understand is that why the police are not clever enough.A great thrilling movie should be watched. It may be long but the time rushing for Beachum is short, with Ted on his case, time will be always short for him as Ted knows how to twist things.

134,David_Frames,Or Columbo goes on a summer sabbatical...,7,23 April 2007,"The problem with something as perfectly realised as Columbo is that when people remake it they're making a rod for their own back. In keeping with the theme of Fracture I offer into evidence, er, Fracture - a Columbo episode in all but name in which Anthony Hopkins takes on the mantle of many before him as the intelligent but arrogant affluent would-be murderer who, in a opening 20 minutes that could have been extracted from almost any Peter Falk outing, plods around, putting the finishing touches to his plan before the carefully thought out execution. Hopkins, an aeronautical engineer and self-made man of means, punishes his wife for having affair with a bullet to the brain. Rough justice you might think and at this point it would be Falk's cue to awkwardly meander into Hopkin's abode, establish his guilt in anything between 5 and 50 seconds and then spend the rest of the movie unravelling the killer's many mistakes before presenting them to him in time for the end credits.Whether Falk was unavailable is never explained, not even a note to say that the lieutenant in Europe seeing relatives. Instead at the point where the entertaining bout of class war fare would commence we meet self-inflated (not literally you understand), cock sure prosecutor Ryan Gosling. Ryan's so full of himself he should be registering as morbidly obese but in the event we find him ready to accept a new high salaried job. With a signed confession from Hopkins his final case with his public office firm should be open and shut. In case we're bored with his ego and the inevitable pride before a fall elephant trap into which Gosling is walking, head in the clouds - there's pretty Rosamund Pike to look at. She's Gosling's new boss elect and she's ready and willing and show him the parts of the law that he can't read about in the public library. So hes arrogant, slow talking, as charismatic as top soil and just as interesting to look at but thank goodness, hes a man of humble origins and as such this sets up the dynamic familiar to fans of Falk whereby the two can clash is a suitably dramatic fashion - one the debonair socialite, the other aspirational and determined to wipe the $250,000 a year smile off Lecter's crumpled face.This isn't quite as promising as it sounds because enjoyable though Fracture is, there's precious few surprises. That's because unlike its televisual progenitor that pretends to show you everything but keeps its best cards hidden for the final reveal, this one gives you too much information too early and thus saps any suspense from the remaining running time. We're never as impressed by Hopkins plan as he is because we've got a fairly good idea of what hes done long before the dim witted Gosling. Perhaps its savings the best for last you're left to wonder and like the glass eyed template, there is of course a twist which will wrong foot the homicidal mastermind but once again, not far from the finish, the screenwriter wrong foots himself and tips the audience off so that when Gosling delivers the final blow, we've been aware of it for the previous 15 minutes. That, as Hitchcock would have said, is bad technique but thats not to write off Fracture because its a breezy, occasionally absorbing courtroom potboiler. Hopkins has a lot of fun toying with the runtish Gosling like a kitten with a toy mouse and the interplay between the two is entertainingly soiled with testosterone. Its that banter and the look on Hopkins face when the hole in his plot is revealed to him that stays with you, long after the implausible contrivances and the gaping Falk shaped gap in the narrative has faded in the mind faster than the blood from Mrs Hopkins face. If Gosling had just had the guts to say ""just one more thing sir"" it'd have been marvelous. Instead just, er, worth a shot. If you know what I mean.",Fracture

The script wasn't as tightly written as one would expect. Many legal points which were raised were accurate but one felt that given the nature of the characters depicted in the film, many more aspects of the law could have to light.In retrospect I feel minimalism worked for the movie.

138,pontifikator,Police procedure with a fatal flaw,7,26 May 2009,"This is an excellent police procedure movie where the police procedure was fatally flawed. Director Gregory Hoblit keeps everything right on track, Anthony Hopkins does his patented Hannibal Lecter routine as the villain, Ted Crawford, and Ryan Gosling is admirably low key as our hero, Willy Beachum (I'm sure the name is not a pun).Ted is a structural flaw finder who is born for the job. He finds flaws in whatever disaster has befuddled the federal or state investigators. He tells poor Willy that he can find the flaw in anything. Willy asks if Ted is looking for Willy's weak spot and gets the answer he doesn't believe:Ted: I've already found yours. Willy: What is it? Ted: You're a winner, Willy. Willy: Yeah. Well, I guess the joke's on me then, isn't it? Ted: You bet your ass, old sport.The thing that interested me is that we're then set up for the classic Greek tragedy.* Willy has his weak spot and is Ted going to be able to exploit it? You bet your ass, old sport. The plot is all laid out for us, the issue is whether Ted can pull it off, and we squirm, giggle, and gloat as Crawford sinks himself deeper into a hole from which he can seemingly never extricate himself until he pulls the rabbit out. Willy had set himself up to work at a high-powered private firm, leaving the DA's office to its poorly paid, humble public servants. Because of the way Crawford has set things up, Willy sacrifices the high-paid job to try to save the case (and his ass) and fails. Since this is a modern movie, Willy of course has the opportunity to turn things around, and Ted gets his comeuppance, but Hoblit keeps even that moving so that we aren't sure Willy can bring it off.I was really impressed with Gosling, who manages to portray a character who is brilliant and manipulative in is own right without making Willy a conceited ass. Hopkins plays psychopaths better than anyone else these days, but I'm hoping he doesn't get stuck in only those rolls. If you have a strong stomach, I recommend seeing him in ""Titus,"" the 1999 movie directed by Julie Taymore.*In ancient Greek tragedy, the rule was that the hero of the play had to have a tragic flaw. The flaw had to be something that was good in the right measure, but that our hero had too much of. Excessive pride, for example, was referred to as hubris. The gods were particularly punishing to heroes with too much pride. In ancient Greek tragedy the hero never won, by the way.

At the beginning of the film we see Ted Crawford - beautifully played by Anthony Hopkins - who is obviously a brilliant man. His hobby is designing part Rube Goldberg, part perpetual motion devices that use steel balls that travel intricate routes. We also get a quick insight into his huge ego. He's not a lovable guy.We also find that his wife who is exhausted by trying to kowtow to Ted's massive ego is in the midst of an affair. She has kept her identity a secret to her lover, but discovers that her affair is no secret to her husband just before he shoots her in the head. This all takes place in the Crawford's home, and Ted remains there until the SWAT team and negotiator arrives. At that point he readily confesses to the crime and later signs a confession.We next meet Willy Beachum, played by Ryan Gosling, who is with the district attorney's office. However, Willy will not be around for long as he has just accepted a position with a prestigious law firm. Circumstances arise - engineered by Ted - causing the judge to assign the murder case to Willy. Needless-to-say, the case is not the slam dunk that Willy perceives it to be, and thus we have a battle of wits between Ted and Willy whose ego is just about as huge as Ted's though he is a slight bit less obnoxious - although not by much.Obviously, it would be inadvisable of me to disclose the mystery that interferes with the quick resolution of the case and the other elements of the plan so masterfully concocted by Ted. I read one review by a man who said he had figured out the ultimate mystery before the climax of the film. He's a much smarter man than I.Apart from the mystery, the enjoyment of this film comes from the superior acting of the two main characters. Anthony Hopkins certainly has a way of excellently portraying brilliant homicidal men, and he gives us a delicious one in this film. I would have not thought that Ryan Gosling could do as well as he did in his part. His performance is a pleasant surprise - for me, at least.Finally the DVD offers us a look at two alternate endings. I usually don't think the alternate endings change the film much, but the decision to change to the final ending makes this film so much better by strengthening the one big mystery of the film.If you're into mysteries and great acting, give Fracture a spin.",Fracture

For one, the ""twist"" near the end of the movie (attempted murder v/s murder) , you could see coming a mile away.The casting left much to be desired also. I believe Ryan Gosling is a terrific actor, but his performance in this film was poor. He came across as just a young, arrogant POS lawyer. His gum-chewing, ""cooler-than-the-other-side-of-the-pillow"" act was cringe-inducing. He was supposedly this young, hotshot lawyer, yet his actions were dumber than a fence post. The scene in the Judge's chambers with the Judge and Anthony Hopkins, after he was attacked in the courtroom by the Detective, showed a somewhat befuddled lawyer who had no idea what was going on. Really??? Thought you were the young high-powered hotshot. He threatens Hopkins with ""Don't make me come across this table"". Really??? Right after an assault in the courtroom, this is all he can think of to say? In front of the Judge? Really??? I could be wrong, but do lawyers make threats that they can't actually follow through on, if need be? ""Don't make me come across this table"" sounds like a threat in a barroom between 2 construction workers. I doubt if any judge would permit something like that in chambers between 2 opposing counsel, and a young, hotshot should have known that was inappropriate.The whole ""find the gun"" charade was just tiresome. The Detective told him that they had gone through the house 3 times...these are knowledgeable, experienced police and forensics people. There IS NO GUN IN THE HOUSE! Have as many temper tantrums as you like...Treating the detective and his people like mis-behaving children will not help, and shows you are no hotshot.

Also the switch in the gun was ludicrous. Surely that would have been noticed in time that the gun wasn't the detectives. And how exactly did Hopkins know what kind of gun the detective had. You expect some films to have some minor implausibilities, but not so MANY. There are lots more stupid things in this movie, but to go on would take months!!!

145,deschreiber,not nearly as clever as it thinks it is,5,2 January 2014,"First off, it has to be said that Ryan Gosling was a terrible choice to play the D.A. He's way too young. Even in the storyline he's supposed to be not long out of law school, so for him to have a senior position such as the D.A. of Los Angeles is just not believable. But just for the sake of argument, let's say some wunderkind did achieve that high position. He wouldn't be a character like the kind Gosling portrayed, so low-energy, slow-walking and slow-talking. He'd be a livewire with a racing mind and quick tongue. It just wasn't a good portrayal.Within several minutes of meeting his new boss at a prestigious law firm where he expects to start a brilliant career, the Gosling character begins to flirt with her. Now how dumb is that in real life? No one with any sense would try something like that. But it's written into the movie to advance some plot points. And to get even more preposterous, the morning after the two have their first night in the sack, she invites him to meet her family over Thanksgiving! What the hey? That just doesn't compute at all. It's just another clunky plot device so that Gosling can meet the lady's father, a judge, and come back to him later to ask him to issue a dubious legal document as a personal favour on very short notice.The holes in the scheme of the ""evil genius"" (really? must he be an evil genius?) have been outlined in other comments here. For me it came as a big disappointment to learn that everything turned on such a simple thing as switching guns. I expected something a little more complex, something more fascinating and revelatory that might tie up half a dozen other plot points. Nah, just a simple trick that, when you give it the slightest bit of thought, probably wouldn't work.When Gosling's boss turns, pauses, and everything stops and goes silent, and he tells Gosling that the case against the murderer had been only one of attempted murder, not murder, there might as well have been a big flashing sign on the screen telling the audience to pay attention because this was going to be critical later. Very amateurish.Fractured is an attempt to produce some really clever story like Sleuth, where brilliant minds dream up complicated scenarios to outwit their opponents. But this is a rather feeble attempt. It will fill an idle hour or two, but don't expect it to make much of an impression.",Fracture
146,samseescinema,"If Fracture were a product, somewhere upon its packaging it would read ""No Assembly Required.""",7,24 April 2007,"Fracture reviewed by Samuel OsbornAs a vehicle, Fracture is a speedy little motorcycle equipped dandily with a sidecar. Ryan Gosling straddles the driver's seat, Anthony Hopkins riding shotgun. The film is an obvious vehicle for the two actors, but as they lithely slide through the genre picture it becomes apparent exactly why: Gosling and Hopkins are unshakably charming. And put to roles that play to all their strengths, Fracture becomes a mildly blissful thing, where the actors need only to read their lines for the film to work. If Fracture were a product, somewhere upon its packaging it would read ""No Assembly Required."" But assembly, in the hands of Director Gregory Hoblit, does indeed occur. He compounds the courtroom genre story of a wily, ladder-climbing lawyer (Ryan Gosling) with the kind of over-the-top genre film-making that most of us thought had died with the advent of subtlety in motion pictures (i.e. sometime after German Expressionism had run its course in the thirties). He laces every angle, shadow, and credit sequence with a visual motif to exude the idea of ""fracture."" The villain, this time Anthony Hopkins playing a billionaire aeronautics mogul, is so diabolically detached from humanity that his hobbies include constructing complex wire contraptions to roll steel marbles through. The hero, Gosling, is fresh enough for Mr. Hoblit to slap him with a quiet southern drawl that sends the alarms for ""character innocence"" blaring. Even the music is a garish knock-off of television courtroom dramas like ""Law & Order"" and ""Boston Legal."" The style, though often pretty, makes us want to scream ""We get it already!""Luckily the writing from Daniel Pyne and Glenn Gers stores up enough cunning to pitch Hopkins and Gosling into several rounds of sly verbal joust. Hopkins' character, the slippery criminal genius Ted Crawford, is a sort-of reprisal of his iconic Hannibal Lecter (mind you, without the bit about cannibalism), managing to craft a defense for shooting his wife despite having given a full confession and being apprehended still with the murder weapon in hand. The young Willy Beachum (Gosling) takes the case with one foot out the door of the D.A.'s office, about to leave for the major-league law firm Wooton & Sims. He's expecting a quick conviction and treats the case like small potatoes. It isn't until he's neck-deep in quicksand and hanging from the cliff of unemployment that he realizes Crawford might have the whole case rigged.The film reads a lot like the 1982 Paul Newman courtroom vehicle, The Verdict, with writers Pyne and Gers even mimicking David Mamet's curt, speedy dialogue. It's at times exhilarating and at other times slowed by the obligations of genre storytelling, where we wish the motions of the formula could just be skimmed over to make way for the more tasty morsels. But the vehicle runs well; it's oiled and manicured for satisfaction. No assembly required. Samuel Osborn",Fracture
147,jackjack-2,Exccellent suspense,8,27 January 2008,"A very well done piece of suspense. Anthony Hopkins plays a brilliant wealthy man who murders his wife and then goes to trial, brilliantly defending himself. The plot is very clever. Only a person who is well versed in criminal law could have guessed the ending. Being a former prosecutor, I successfully guessed how it would end about 2/3s of the way through. However, Ryan Gosing plays the role of a hot shot Young DA. At first, I wanted him to lose the case but during the trial he did something that made him a hero. I think that it was written that way on purpose. In the beginning, the audience sympathizes with Hopkins even though he shots his adulterous wife. But Gosing has to make a very hard choice during the trial and he shows great courage, which at least to me made him the hero. It was the high point of the movie for me.",Fracture
148,bburns,The weak point is the script,6,7 July 2007,"In ""Fracture"", Anthony Hopkins' character says he was trained as a young boy to always look for the flaw in everything. I watched this film with the same axiom in mind. There was no flaw in the acting: Hopkins along with Ryan Gosling, Bob Gunton, Embeth Davidtz, Cliff Curtis and David Strathairn all give fine performances. Nor is it with the direction by Gregory Hoblit. In addition to eliciting the best from his cast, he also has a stylish flair with the camera. The real weak spot--and it's a big one--is with the half-baked screenplay by Daniel Pyne and Glen Gers.""Fracture"" starts off with Jennifer Crawford (Davidtz) at a hotel with her lover, Rob Nunnaly (Billy Burke). Unfortunately for them both, they are spotted by Jennifer's jealous husband Ted (Hopkins), an aeronautical engineer with a genius IQ. He shoots Jennifer in the head as soon as she gets home; not fatally, but enough to leave her a vegetable. The security system in the Crawfords' home goes off, and Ted promptly confesses to the arresting officer, Rob Nunnaly--the same guy he had spied sleeping with Jennifer.The prosecution of his case is assigned to Willy Beachum (Gosling) a hotshot with a reputation for not losing, and one foot out the door. When Ted opts to defend himself, Willy thinks this will be easy. Especially when Ted insists on pleading not guilty to attempted murder, even though he confessed to the arresting officer. When Ted points out that the arresting officer was his wife's lover, the prosecution's whole case goes out the window, and Willy is forced for the first time to rely on tenacity (which he lacks) rather than brains (which he has). This does not sit well with his prospective new boss (Rosamund Pike), with whom he starts an affair. Nor with his boss at the DA's office (Strathairn), who regards Willy with fatherly affection.I will not go further into the plot except to say that it seems to be pulled out of a third-rate Perry Mason re-run, and I figured out the final plot twist well before the end of the film. A note to screenwriters Pyle and Gers: If the two leads in your movie are supposed to be geniuses, it helps if the script isn't stupid.The experience of watching this film was not entirely wasted, however. Hopkins and Strathairn give good enough performances that even despite the silly premise of the movie, they might still snag Oscar nominations. And visually, it is quite stylish--particularly the parts in the Crawfords' home and the close-ups of Ted's intricately designed toys.However, whether a film is good or bad rests mostly with the screenplay, and the screenplay of ""Fracture"" is bad enough that all the eye candy and great acting in the world can't overcome it. 6 out of 10.",Fracture
149,frankwhat,"""Fracture""  A Break into the Abnormal",7,7 May 2007,"I was quite surprised at how much I enjoyed watching this film as I heard many positive critical reviews before going into it so I had high expectations to begin with. However I was not let down one bit since ""Fracture"" more than held its own. It contained a very simple plot structure but also offered a very original take on a different type of court case. While it might not be possible in real life, it worked magic on the big screen and transformed into an excellent film almost within the first few minutes.Even though Sir Anthony Hopkins played a role almost exactly identical to that of his previous Hannibal Lecter, it was still great to see him back in this form because that's what I always thought he was best at: the maniacal genius. Although I will admit he does have an incredible range. He didn't add anything new to his character that we haven't seen him do before, yet I still loved watching him whenever he was on the screen. The big shock for me was Ryan Gosling. I knew he was a good actor and that he has been in some great movies but this was his best performance by far. He just calmly waltzed into each scene and was able to hold his own against the veteran Hopkins. Gosling's natural ability is simply breathtaking with how much of it he was blessed with. Any doubts of him I had before are now officially thrown out the window. The rest of the ensemble was at least adequate and the only one who I was a little disappointed in was Billy Burke since he didn't seem completely convincing.There is somewhat of a twist waiting for the viewer at the final showdown and what I loved about it was it wasn't thrown in there for no reason. It actually went with the story, which is what's supposed to happen but hasn't lately in numerous other cases. It won't throw you for a complete loop but rather ties up some loose ends that had me scratching my head up until then. While there's elements of the legal proceedings that are completely Hollywoodized and could in no way happen in real life, I didn't seem to mind at all and was actually glad they did that. This was most likely because it flowed with the story and offered a fresh perspective.""Fracture"" will be one of those small cinematic feats that goes overlooked and prematurely fades into oblivion but for those that do get to see it you won't be disappointed. You may not agree with some parts and might even spot some dead on plot flaws, but if you can overlook that and instead focus on the film as a whole you are in for a treat. The courtroom drama is suspenseful and is presented just as it should be. The quips taken from both sides are clever and offer some well-timed comic relief. The love story while not necessarily essential didn't take anything away from the other parts either. Job well done to mostly everyone on this production, this was a tightly wrought law thriller that was no chip off the old block by any means!",Fracture

151,Billy_Crash,The Film's So Fractured it's Broken Beyond Repair,3,8 March 2008,"You can find all the plot summary breakdowns in other reviews, so I'll just get down to the meat of the matter: The movie is horrendously flawed and does not work - therefore, it isn't worth your time or even a rental. (I only gave it three stars because of the cinematography, for Gosling's restrained performance, and for seeing an arrogant protagonist face-off against an arrogant villain with humility ultimately leading to one true winner.)Spoilers abound:How did Crawford know Detective Flores would be the officer to come to his door? That's a total roll of the dice. Even if he knew when Flores had his shift, there are multiple detectives in any precinct that can pick up the phone and respond to any crime. If Flores did not respond, Crawford could have requested to only speak with Flores, but the major ""aha"" moment later in the film would have been spoiled.When Crawford made the gun switch, unbeknownst to Flores, Crawford would have had to clean the gun extremely well before doing so. Every officer has to keep his gun in top shape and if Flores had discovered his automatic had been fired, which is very easy to determine, he would have known something was up. Since the police had searched Crawford's home three times, they would have discovered used gun cleaning paraphernalia unless Crawford had cleaned up after himself. Furthermore, Crawford would have had to make certain he loaded the exact same brand of bullets back into Flores' gun so the detective wouldn't be the wiser.After Crawford's acquittal, Flores who appeared despondent and disheveled, but not that emotionally distraught, commits suicide before leaving the courthouse (obviously the shot is a symbolic gesture towards his lover, Mrs. Crawford, who was also shot in the head). But why let Crawford live? All Flores had to do was wait for Crawford to emerge from the courtroom and he could have taken out his lover's attacker before killing himself. Allowing Crawford to live is ridiculous especially after Flores began beating Crawford at the initial crime scene and had to held back by fellow officers. Flores also tampered with evidence to put Crawford behind bars. Flores definitely would have wanted revenge and would not have just killed himself.Granted, we never see how Crawford got into Flores' hotel room, but since Hopkins' character is of genius status and may have used something as simple as a ""bump"" key, the element is not worth discussion.Though not a spoiler per se, it was gratuitous, over-the-top and just plain silly to have Beachum bed down with Gardner, his new boss. This did nothing to propel the story forward and revealed nothing more about Beachum's self-centered and arrogant persona that the audience didn't already know from the beginning of the tale. In that vein, the audience does not need to hear Labruto call his underling ""arrogant"", when the audience already knows Beachum is just that. By stating the fact, established from wonderful writing in the first act, simply implies that the concept of arrogance must be stated in case the audience is too stupid to get it. Insulting to say the least.When Beachum gets the order of protection at the last minute to prevent Crawford from ""pulling the plug"" on his wife, why didn't he contact the hospital by phone? Instead, the audience is dealt a segment of lame tension as Beachum tries to get to Mrs. Crawford's bedside in time. Of course he doesn't make it. The tension could have been real and maintained at a high level, by switching back and forth from the hospital bed with doctors preparing for Mrs. Crawford's removal from life support and Beachum's running all over creation in his search for a civil judge. In the end, Beachum would've gotten the document, would have called the hospital and as the doctor is contacted, the audience would hear the flatline ""beep"" and watch the sheet being pulled over Mrs. Crawford. For that matter, we could have watched Beachum trying to get the doctor on his cell as he drove erratically to the hospital, only to be put on hold or given the run-around to add to his as well as the audience's frustration.""Fracture"" could have been an excellent thriller, but it just didn't add up in the end.",Fracture
152,das417,A Rather Dry Murder Mystery,6,16 August 2007,"Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling) is a young hot shot district attorney for the City of Los Angeles. He has a success rate of 97% and that, along with a special contact he has made, allows him to gain entry into one of the most prestigious private law firms that any lawyer dreams of entering. He has already began packing his bags and is readying himself for the final goodbye from his old job so he can earn the money and success that follow all corporate lawyers.There remains one final case and it is one that will challenge every skill that Ted believes he has. The death of Jennifer Crawford (Embeth Davidtz) at the hands of her near genius husband Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) appears to be a slam shut case. Ted has confessed and the murder weapon is present. Willy believes he has yet another easy case he can claim as a victory before moving on with his career.However, not everything is as what it appears to be and Fracture builds up what could have been an intriguing murder mystery. The responding hostage negotiator to the Crawford home at the time of the murder is Detective Rob Nunally (Billy Burke) who was having an affair with Jennifer and even the day of her shooting he had been with her. Once it is learned, on stand and under oath during trial, of Nunally's conflict of interest towards Ted that Beachum realizes that he may end up losing not only the case but also the dream job that he has recently landed. That and the discovery that the suspected murder weapon is not what it appears to be only adds doubt to a weakened case.Noticed I said that I said Facture could have been an intriguing mystery. The problems almost begin once the basic idea of the plot has been given. Instead of twists and suspense to keep one guessing on the outcome, Fracture instead relies on Crawfords smart and witty insights into Beachum and the trial as a whole. Hopkins is excellent but his character Ted has little more to say then snide insults and after awhile it grows tiring once the case appears to be heading toward an inevitable and slow conclusion. He is the center of Fracture but as the center if one loses interest in him then one loses interest in the movie as a whole.Beachum's own relationship to Nikki Gardener (Roseamund Pike), an associate with the new law firm, is slight depth for Willy's character development but almost unnecessary as a whole with the exception to remind him that he is throwing away his new job because of his ego. She fades out almost as quickly as she fades into the movie once Willy decides that he will prosecute Ted even if it means he might end up losing. There is no real conclusion to the relationship between Willy and Nikki and it seems that Fracture could have gone almost without it.The problem with movies like Fracture is that they offer so much in the beginning as crime dramas but end with a whimper. The final revelation to how the weapon went missing is interesting but by the ending it is easy not to care anymore. Fracture has lost any sort of real drama it once held onto the beginning and ends much as it began. That is, with a trial with Willy at one end and Ted on the other.6/10",Fracture

One is prosecutor from the district attorneys office and the other is charged with attempted murder on his wife. The story shows that the prosecutor is about to leave his job for anther one in a big corporation and that this is his last case working for the district attorney. He has a ""signed and sealed confession"" from the prosecuted, played by Anthony Hopkins, and this makes him slobby and he shows up unprepared in court. As the case develops its becomes complicated; the murder weapon can't be found and the confession is all of a sudden invalid as the police officer who was present during this was having an affair with the prosecuted's wife.It was a hollow experience once again to experience Hopkins in a role where he plays the sophisticated and very intelligent criminal who is prepared, in a sense, to challenge the whole world. He overplays being a mastermind. He is overtly self-confident and he doesn't let a chance go by without playing some sort of game with his opponent; the prosecutor. It is a part we have seen Hopkins in many times by now and I don't really think that he or the story shows us anything that we haven't seen before. Therefore my main conclusion is that this movie is mediocre. Hopkins needs to re-invent himself and get away from roles that he has been type-casted to.Regards SimonPs.

155,sinncross,Guilty of a good time...,7,12 May 2007,"Murder mysteries are mysteries in themselves, as many are never able to balance the tedious court scenes, with the explosive crime solving. One of the two falters, and the viewer is left with in inadequate experience, but luckily there are the exceptions.Fracture begins with the introduction of Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) who soon after shoot his wife, Jennifer (Embeth Davidtz), for her affair with police detective, Rob Nunally (Billy Burke). Ted then confesses to the murder, but soon retracts his plea at this hearing. Hotshot district attorney, Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling), decides to tackle the case, but he soon discovers that he is being outsmarted by Ted.The story of Fracture is instantly captivating with an intriguing look at Ted, where we are introduced to his profession as a structural engineer. And the imminent murder scene is shocking and really sets up the rest of the story rather convincingly. The courtroom scenes are never dull, which helps keep the pace of the film flowing. Ted's scenes are slow bust mesmerizing as we begin to unravel his multi-layered character, and are easily contrasted with Willy's, which are smooth and glitzy. If the story falters at any point, it is in its execution of the legal technicalities, especially at the end where it seems somewhat rushed. The point comes across in a fuzzy manner, and there is bound to be debate with the films end. The final scene also seems to be rather unneeded in the wider context of the thriller aspect of the film, as it comes across as forced humour. With this, the film does appear to be a tad too long, even if its pacing is consistent.The thrilling story is well helped along by some rather good acting. Most of the screen time is given to both Hopkins and Gosling. Hopkins brings elements of his Hannibal Lector character into Fracture, especially his cold and intellectual tendencies. It's difficult to distinguish between both characters, which only serves to make Ted far more sinister. Gosling's character is arrogant, exuding self-confidence at every corner, and when the odds become increasingly stacked against him, Gosling is able to show his character at his weakest. The other characters, while not as convincing as the two forerunners, are neither bad. The only problem is how the story ultimately belittles Hopkins character, which is a pity since it really is one of his more interesting performances.Violence only stems from the single act of murder early on in the film, and pretty much dies after that, albeit the aftermath of a suicide, which is not anything gruesome. There are scenes with are post-sexual intercourse and never revealing, but the film does contain a few usages of language, namely the F-word.Besides some law issues, Fracture proves to be an entertaining, although a little long, thriller which is held tightly by some good acting and an intriguing storyline.--- Also available on Entertainment.Wikia ---",Fracture

I enjoyed Fracture not least because I thought is was extraordinarily clever and lets face is, anything with Anthony Hopkins in is worth watching. I never saw the twist coming at the end and all the way through the film I was never sure whether the good guy or the bad guy was going to triumph. It is an inferior film to a lot of Hitchcock film because the thing about Hitchcock is that not only does he make clever films but he charms you along the way. Fracture does that but only to a point. It has none of the stylish filming that Hitchcock had and yet I can't help thinking that Fracture is perfect for the modern day.

159,aeo,A smart and well acted crime movie.,7,8 May 2007,"Before seeing this movie, I saw Anthony Hopkins on Entertainment Tonight where he mentions that he played the evil character in this movie in the mold of Hannibal Lechter of Silence of the Lambs. After seeing the movie I could see the comparison. Both Hannibal and the character he portrays in this movie are diabolical, very smart, and have a certain amount of hubris to their respective characters.I found this movie to be well written in terms of the story as well as the dialog. The plot itself is nothing new. You have a husband who finds out that his wife is cheating on him. The quirk in the story here is that the other man is a high ranking police officer. Also, the husband develops a elaborate and brilliant plan to kill his wife and ruin, instead of killing, the other man.In this mix is a deputy district attorney who has an excellent conviction rate and who cannot wait to enter private practice with a high paying law firm. The killer uses the deputy D.A.'s cockiness to his advantage.The ending itself was quite unexpected. I mean, I expected the usual plot of the killer being caught in some form or another and going off to prison. Here, the audience is left to their own imagination of how the movie ends. I liked that aspect. It leaves a certain cliff hanger but you know that the killer will probably be found guilty given the direction of the movie towards the end.That being said, the movie did have weak points. After the killer gets off the attempted murder charge, the other man kills himself on the steps of the courthouse. I don't know but usually if a killer is freed, someone close to the victim would be so outraged that they would try to kill the killer rather than themselves.Also, I did not particularly care for the actor who portrayed the deputy district attorney. I have seen him in various supporting roles and he has a face and acting ability that is fine as a supporting character but not as a main character. He did not have the acting range to adequately portray the deputy D.A. very well. But in fairness, his adversary was Anthony Hopkins and Hopkins is such a great actor that his acting ability dwarfs other actors and actresses around him unless their acting ability is equal or above him.But overall, the movie was very entertaining.

Although some comments have pointed out the weaker aspects of the plot, most reviews are very positive as regards the acting which to be really honest did not impress me at all. Anthony Hopinkins with his watered down version of Hannibal Lecter has become all too familiar and apart from the fact that his appearance on screen reveals unmistakable signs of increased age, his presence has really nothing new to offer. Although he's undoubtedly a great actor, since he first starred as the schizophrenic ventriloquist in ""Magic""(1978) he has played that role a little too often in order to maintain the viewer's attention. Ryan Gosling has this air about him that makes him a very obnoxious sort of personality. The more I see him acting, the more I cannot detach myself from the frustrating feeling that in real life he must be very irritating also.I admit that this impression is entirely subjective but the fact that he was constantly chewing jelly beans or whatever only contributed further to my aversion. All the other characters in this movie are of no importance at all and not worth describing. On the whole a very mediocre movie with very conventional roles and conventional acting.",Fracture
162,Thunderbuck,Grown-up fun--Good characters make it a decent thriller,7,25 April 2007,"As much as this film carries echoes of other thrillers--particularly certain ones starring Anthony Hopkins--it's also a lot of fun.It helps that the characters are good. Ryan Gosling makes his Willie Beachum character a believably arrogant young hotshot, and it's really Beachum's story that makes the movie. When we first meet him, he's in the career fast-track, making ready to jump ship at the Los Angeles DA's office for a cushy corporate law job, but he has one little, simple case to clear up.Hopkins plays an engaging, if occasionally distracting villain. We see Hopkins' Ted Crawford shoot his wife early on, so there's no question of his character's guilt, and Crawford's insistence on representing himself in court seems like folly, but of course the brilliant engineer has plans (he has a hobby of building intricate, Rube Goldberg-like structures where glass balls roll and collide; an amusing bit of character exposition).Hopkins lends his usual estimable Hopkins presence to the movie, and while it counts for a lot, his character seems a little under-written. Some of his dialog is presumably meant to be shocking; in a conference with Beachum and a judge, Crawford is asked how he knows about a particular piece of evidence and answers, ""My dick knows."" He explains that by ""dick"" he means his private detective, but the attempt to shock sounds lame and out of character. Hopkins also plays Crawford as a crusty old Scot, but it's only as the movie progresses that we hear any hint of a brogue. Distracting, though not unforgivable.The plot has no serious holes, though I found I'd guessed a key plot-point a good 30 minutes before it was revealed. Even so, the ending was pretty good.A tiny bit of editing would have bumped this movie down to PG-13 territory; what little foul language there is seems forced and gratuitous (with the exception of one marvelous courtroom scene), and the violence wouldn't even raise an eyebrow on an episode of CSI. The producers almost seemed to be going out of their way to make SURE the film got that R rating.I will say it is nice to see a movie made for a primarily grown-up audience, though. There are no car chases or explosions in FRACTURE, and what suspense there is comes completely from the characters and the story. While not brilliant, it is clever and entertaining, and a completely worthwhile night at the movies.",Fracture
163,treeskier802,Characters Grip Your Interest Even Though Premise Is A Stretch,7,30 September 2007,"The two leading characters in this film played by Gosling and Hopkins really grasped my interest. They were both engaging in a way that made me hang on to every word they said. Their war of wits with each other was a pleasure to watch. Gosling is refreshing and held his own against the brilliant Hopkins.With that said, the plot is quite a stretch. Hopkins kills his wife with a well-thought out, yet highly unlikely plot, which is only believable because Hopkins' character is so intelligent. But, at the same time, the plot is so unbelievable because Everything and I mean everything goes just as he has planned it. In the real world, in the heat of a murder, you would have to believe something would happen NOT according to plan. Something! Anyway, Hopkins faces Gosling in a war of wits in the courtroom. Gosling is a hotshot prosecuter who has never lost a case. Hopkins is simply a genius.However, and do not read this part if you don't want to spoil the ending, Gosling baits Hopkins at the end. Hopkins was acquitted with attempted murder and for some reason, the genius he is, doesn't realize that once his wife is now dead from her coma, he can be charged with murder. So, double indemnity is off the table. Sure he would have realized this...this guy who set up this unbelievable complex crime and then acted as his own lawyer and got an acquittal. Hmm.Anyway, I am rating this movie a 7 of 10 because it was entertaining to see Hopkins act as the super smart bad guy again and to have Gosling match wits with him just as well as Jody Foster did. If you think about this film and its plot holes and cheesiness of the copying of Hopkins' previous roles, then you lose respect for it. This will inadvertently happen to you if you ponder this movie AFTER watching it. With that said, in the throes of watching this film, you can be taken in. It can be entertaining. Not a great film.

Pike's character is pretty much irrelevant to the story. It's just that every Hollywood thriller has to have a good looking blonde, right?One twist is that Crawford confesses to the murder and insists on defending himself in court without a lawyer. The other twist is that the detective who took Crawford's confession was having an affair with Crawford's wife. This is not revealed until the trial, and Beachum is not ready for it. The judge threatens to declare a mistrial unless Beachum can find some new evidence.That's about all you need to know. There's lots of ""clever"" dialogue, all of the cast members are magazine-model good looking, and Hopkins assumes his familiar Hannibal Lecter persona.It's pure Hollywood braggadocio, with all of its requisite affectation, implausibility, and melodrama.

167,A_Roode,The Old Master and the Rising Star play chess,8,15 April 2007,"The character played by Anthony Hopkins tells a story in the film to Ryan Gosling. The story is about sorting eggs on a farm when he was a boy and about putting aside 300 eggs that all had minute cracks or imperfections. The moral is that everything has a weakness if you look closely enough. Hopkins is using the story to warn Gosling that his near perfect conviction record is about to be tested like never before.I caught an advance screening of 'Fracture' and am counting myself among the lucky. 'Fracture' showcases two terrific performances. The first is Ryan Gosling who plays a hot shot Assistant District Attorney on the verge of joining a very lucrative private law firm. He's only got one case left to handle and, although it looks like a slam dunk on paper, he'll soon find it to be a bit more formidable than he first thought.The second great performance is Sir Anthony Hopkins. Stealing every scene he's in with charm, humour and menace, Hopkins turns in one of his most enjoyable performances of recent years. Hopkins plays the accused in Gosling's last case and goes out of his way to give Gosling a very bad day. The battle of wills between the two leads is central to the movie and their combat is electrifying.One of the main questions in the movie is the location of the murder weapon. The film quite explicitly shows the crime of the film and how it is carried out in the first ten minutes of the movie. It seemed obvious to me where the gun was (although my friends told me after the film they had no idea). For my part, knowing where the gun was didn't hurt the film at all because although Gosling's battle to solve the case and get a conviction are certainly a core part of the film, 'Fracture' works better as a character study. Both leads are over-flowing with pride. Both believe themselves to be as flawless as the eggs from the story are supposed to be, but both will come to realize that they have micro-fractures too. This movie is about their arrogance and ultimately about how they deal with the discovery that perfection is a little more elusive than they thought. 'Fracture' shows all seven deadly sins at work and places Pride as the deadliest -- all else springs from it.'Fracture' has a great score, a terrific script and dynamic characters who are believable in everything they do. This is a rich and highly enjoyable film. I fear it might get lost in the shadow of huge summer blockbusters like Spiderman 3 which is really a shame -- totally engaging little gems like this are why I love movies. 'Fracture' is well worth your time and the price of admission.",Fracture
168,janos451,'Fracture' is wholly excellent,7,18 April 2007,"Just as Frank Gehry's Disney Concert Hall, used in one of its scenes, ""Fracture"" is an intriguing, gleaming, exciting work. It's one of the best, most enjoyable recent films from Hollywood; ""could have been a contender"" to be called great if only it went beyond pure entertainment, if it left the viewer with some lasting thoughts or feelings beyond the fun of watching it - which is nothing to sneeze at.Starring the most seductive evil-doer in all cinema, Anthony Hopkins, ""Fracture"" is an upside-down, Hitchcockian thriller. No need to wait two hours to find who did it. Bright and early, in full view of the audience, the Hopkins character shoots his cheating wife (Embeth Davidtz). The rest of the story - and excitement - is about his devilishly clever scheme to get away with it. Sure, it's been done before, but rarely this well. Director Gregory Hoblit (of ""Primal Fear"" and ""Frequency"") keeps it all taut, fascinating, both dramatic and humorous. The cinematographer, Kramer Morgenthau (concentrating recently on TV productions), provides a brilliant contribution - the film shines and shimmers. Bad-guy Hopkins doesn't have a knight in shining armor for an opponent. Ryan Gosling plays a young, ambitious, and somewhat sleazy assistant district attorney, who takes conviction for granted, while concentrating on a lucrative offer from a big corporate law firm - and a less than convincing affair with the fetching Rosamund Pike, his next boss-to-be.The clever criminal wipes the judicial floor with the talented by careless prosecutor, and thereby hangs the tale, as the Gosling character makes a near-storybook conversion from hustler to a Man Who Cares. Hopkins and a fine cast - including David Strathairn, Fiona Shaw, and soprano Vivica Genaux (performing in Disney Hall) - overcome the occasionally flawed script, and keep it all going well enough to prevent a trip to the facilities, however near they may be. You stay and watch.Pay close attention to the events leading up to the shooting: you will still not figure out the whole scheme, but may stay ahead of the district attorney.",Fracture
169,BJBatimdb,"A very cool, well-made thriller - but let down a bit by the end.",7,5 May 2007,"Fracture is really good value for money. Effectively a courtroom drama, the writing and performances takes this to another level and makes it tense and creepy.Anthony Hopkins is just brilliant in this movie. He improves with age. His reactions are controlled but powerful, conveying whole emotions with tiny movements of his eyes or lips - even a sense of true evil which (to my mind) he never achieved in Silence of the Lambs. His work since that film has been getting better and better and I'd pay to watch him clip his toenails. Luckily this film gives him terrific stuff to get his teeth into, and he takes a role which might have been hammy and gives it real menace. Ryan Gosling is wonderfully cast as the cocky young lawyer who is taken down a peg or two by Hopkins' character. The way he shifts through overt confidence to raw desperation is truly great, and it was nice to see a movie that didn't chicken out of some harsh realities that others might have caved in to.Kudos to the director for allowing his actors to underplay their parts. They were well-written enough to be less-is-more and even minor characters have a sense of their own place in the world which is too infrequently seen. Cliff Curtis as the detective under pressure and Billy Burke as the hostage negotiator shine in smaller roles. The only exception is Rosamund Pike as Nikki Gardner, who comes off as a device when she falls for Gosling indiscriminately and then risks her career by going out on a limb for him.In a way, the plot is not worth the two outstanding central performances. The script is original and darkly humorous in places, and the writers have an ear for dialogue that is fresh and not over-played, but the twist ending is poor, predictable, and not worthy of the brilliance of Hopkins' character. It's the only reason this didn't get an '8' rating from me. Despite that, there's so much else to enjoy in Fracture, that I'd heartily recommend it to any movie-goer, whatever their film preferences.",Fracture
170,editor-299,Fairly interesting courtroom thriller,6,16 April 2007,"After far too many films in which Anthony Hopkins (I'll withhold the ""Sir"" title until all prints of ""Bobby"" are destroyed) portrays an addled, long-winded, over-the-top American character (see the aforementioned ""Bobby,"" as well as ""Proof,"" ""Amistad"" and ""All the King's Men""), he is finally featured in a role in which his crusty, yet suave British mannerisms are perfectly suited.""Fracture"" isn't his best role (that was far and away ""Remains of the Day""), nor is it a great film, but it's a tight little drama with nice work from its leads, Hopkins and Ryan Gosling (fresh off his Oscar nod for ""Half-Nelson"").Here, Hopkins plays Ted Crawford, a meticulous structural engineer who designs and builds elaborate contraptions in his spare time. When he catches his wife, having an affair with a cop, however, he snaps, confronts and shoots her.It's all pretty open-and-shut, but in court, against pretty boy prosecutor, Willie Beachum (Gosling), a series of technicalities allows him to escape his foul deed. Now it's up to Beachum (who was about to quit the DA's office and join a top corporate firm) to grow a conscience and attempt to put the cool and calculating intellectual behind bars.With first-class work by the leads, as well as David Strathairn (""Good Night, And Good Luck,"" ""We Are Marshall""), ""Fracture"" walks the thin line between cynical manipulation and a genuine courtroom-cat-and-mouse thriller, like ""Anatomy of a Murder"" (only without the ""panties"" references).Hopkins' character is a combination of Hannibal Lechter (of course) and Al Pacino in ""The Devil's Advocate""; while Gosling's ""aw shucks"" demeanor may get a bit tedious, at times, but does not detract from the film's overall sharpness.The look on Hopkin's face near the end is priceless, and makes us remember his work before his recent ham hock roles when he could do more with a glance or a single word than most did with a page of dialog.",Fracture
171,archiecm,Good film with a surprise. Flaws appear in second viewing.,8,28 April 2008,"I don't know if they really are flaws but on viewing this film again, already knowing ""how it's done,"" I noticed that an awful lot of lucky events HAVE to occur or Ted Crawford's (Hopkins) character is dead in the water. His scheme to get away with murder depends on him and the cop having the same gun. Now if he didn't, Hopkins could go out and buy a matching one but that means he would have to break into the cop's living area two different times--once to check out the gun and a second time to switch the guns.I originally thought it unlikely that Crawford could count on Nunally catching the case. But another reviewer cleared that up. Nunally is a hostage negotiator not a homicide cop. Crawford pretends his wife is still alive and is a hostage. He also calls headquarters to see when Nunally is due back. What Crawford cannot bank on is an opportunity to switch guns. They have to have the gun standoff at the door. Both have to agree to put their guns down. In the film it's Nunally who has the idea. That's very fortunate. Suppose Crawford has to suggest it? Perhaps Nunally doesn't trust Crawford and won't go along. I could see a lot of cops not suggesting or going along with such a solution. Suppose he does disarm himself but hands his gun to a cop behind him or simply places it outside? S**t's creek again.And that's not all: When the other cop, Detective Flores is on the phone with Willy Beechum and telling him that the bullets don't match the gun, he reads off the make and model of the gun from Ted Crawford's bill of sale. But there's also a serial number on that bill of sale. That number wouldn't match the serial number on the gun they have confiscated because they have Nunally's unfired gun. But he doesn't read it.Those are the big ones. I was also a little confused about how far Nunelly went in planting the fake gun. Remember Beechum toys with the idea of using that fake gun right up to the time he says ""no new evidence."" Did Nunally also switch slugs at the evidence locker so that they'd match the bogus gun? If he did then those bogus slugs won't match the real slug that's in Mrs. Crawford's brain once it's removed. And the ""real"" gun (Crawford's) will match the kill slug but not the ones shot around the room because Nunally switched them using a friend at the evidence room that owed him a favor. Once the trial is over Nunally kills himself in the hall without switching the bullets back in storage. But the film is worth watching even with the string of coincidences. The two main actors are superb as is Rosalind Pike.",Fracture
172,rlnutt,Great Murder Mystery... FINALLY!!!,8,21 April 2007,"This was a well written and well acted movie that kept me guessing throughout the whole story! Anthony Hopkins character is, well, likable and you can understand his reasons why he did it (no spoilers, that 'act' happens in the first 5 minutes of the movie!) and Ryan Gosling's character is a highly ambitious prosecuting attorney taking a last case before he leaves for the private sector.My only 'fault' with this movie is the relationship with Gosling's character and with his soon to be boss Rosamund Pike's character. It serves little purpose to move the story along and there is a bit of choppiness with their meeting and hopping in the sack! I thought it was a thrown in part for the movie that serves no purpose. They could have left it out altogether and got to the end and said what they were wanting to say!

However, the rest of the movie was done very well until the hackneyed ending. I had an inkling that it would end as it did, but while watching it, I had a glimmer of hope that it would have something more original and creative ... like, what if the wife woke up?

But the directions is a bit heavy-handed and at times so studied that the film seems to plod along. The music, while striking, is overbearing.

175,javaman-7,Gosling holds his own with screen legend Hopkins.,7,20 September 2007,"Java Man Reviews ""Fracture"" (2007, R). Directed by Gregory Hoblit. Written by Daniel Pyne & Glenn Gers. Starring Anthony Hopkins, Ryan Gosling, David Strathairn, Rosamund Pike, Embeth Davidtz, Billy Burke & Cliff Curtis. Running Time: 112 minutes. This review originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.OVERVIEW: Ted Crawford (Hopkins) is an engineering genius who owns an aeronautical firm, drives a sleek sports car, lives on a luxurious estate, and shares it all with his much-younger trophy wife, Jennifer (Davidtz). Like the high-tech products he designs, Crawford likes everything to be flawless, without even the slightest hint of a fracture. So when he learns that Jennifer is having an affair, he devises the perfect plan to deal with her and her lover. Like the Rube Goldberg contraptions he keeps in his mansion, the plan is a complex combination of actions and reactions which only the designer can fully comprehend. It begins, for instance, with Crawford's signed confession.Ambitious assistant district attorney Willy Beachum (Gosling) is assigned to the case which he plans to wrap up before he leaves government work for a lucrative job with a hotshot downtown law firm. He figures the case is a ""slam dunk"" and doesn't give it his full attention--a ""fracture"" that Crawford has already anticipated. When the case unravels for the young prosecutor, his entire career is at stake and he must try to find a flaw in Crawford's ""perfect crime."" REVIEW: 3 OUT OF 4 JAVA MUGS The storyline of Fracture is quite compelling and has enough suspense to keep the viewer involved all the way through. It's only after you leave the theater that some of the plot's improbabilities become evident. But the main attraction is quality acting by the two male leads.Gosling, who was nominated for best actor for last year's Half Nelson, holds his own with one of the screen's all-time greats. Though Hopkins has been accused of phoning in a tepid version of his Hannibal Lecter persona, his character is really more complex than the cannibal, and nearly as scary. David Strathairn, as Willy's boss at the DA's office, also gives a strong performance as the dedicated public servant.The women's roles are less impressive. Davidtz is adequate for the few scenes she is in, but Pike, as the bitchy barrister who pursues Beachum, does not rise above the mundane material written for her character.The film's style helps create a sense of menace, especially the outdoor, wide-angle shots that come from nowhere but remind us that things are more distorted than they seem.The best reason to see this movie is a suspenseful battle between two compelling characters, played by two impressive actors.",Fracture

It set up an intriguing conflict that appeared to be heading towards a quality insight into even greater suspense & thoughtful input! Instead it became a melodrama that despite fine acting from Anthony Hopkins, reduced itself into a predictable struggle that had nowhere to go but the obvious! I thought I had it figured out at the one third mark! I was right! It was so obvious that everything that seemed to be, was not somehow to work out! Everything pointed that way! Otherwise, there would have been no second half! It has other flaws but one of my companions rated it 10/10! As much as I love her, that I could never endorse! I respect such & other optional views that could only be diversely extreme from mine!!! But consider too the prosecuting lawyer, who surely would have wound up in jail himself for some of his actions!!! Logic justice & fairness are replaced by blindness, passionate opinion without foundation(that was sure to be challenged & fail) & a pathetic attempt at desperate acts that other than in a movie would surely NEVER succeed in convincing most anyone!!! That's apart from an uncharacteristic courtroom scene, at a crucial moment where the prosecution is lost for words!!! When was the last time you saw a lawyer, or salesman as this guy was acted, with passionate intent, desperate & SPEECHLESS? Time & again & denied? Being presented in such a way??? My case rests!!! 6/10.(But no way 6/10 for the prosecution case or its lawyer! 1/10 would be more appropriate & for their affiliated! People I would hate to have defending me in court! I suppose that's why they were the prosecution!)Severely fractured!",Fracture
178,joliefille411,Intriguing...,7,30 April 2007,"Overall, the film was pretty good. It follows the story of a man who kills his adulterous wife, but because of the ego of his prosecutor, manages to avoid sentencing. I liked how they made Ted (Hopkins) a very enticing villain- you almost want to root for him, yet the story is mostly about the young lawyer set against him. Willy (Gosling) is a talented upstart just beginning to hit the big legal scene in LA. However, his Midas touch reveals it's problems as he lets his self-assurance blind him to the huge flaws in the case. Willy has to learn a hard lesson, but in the meantime realizes what being a lawyer should truly be about. Despite being a very calculating story about human nature, I was pleasantly surprised at the positive messages. Willy makes his mistakes, but is given a second chance at the shallow ideals he'd been working for. Instead, he decides to risk, and lose, everything to pursue what he knew was true. It's not often I see a movie where the hero can lose it all, but I don't walk out feeling like the world is a dismal abyss.A few drawbacks, this film was unnecessarily long. I don't mind long movies, as long as they have a reason to be so. This one, however, tended to drag, especially towards the ending. I feel like the director lost his fizz or didn't know how to end it, so just let the story peter out. It seemed he wanted to give the obligatory signal of a happy ending, but was unable to handle the excessive length. The last scene didn't fit at all. I also was disappointed in how obvious the murder ""mystery"" was. I won't spoil it, but what ended up happening was the first thing that popped into my mind.So, despite being a tad long, this film was worth it. Usually I don't see the need to watch thrillers more than once, because once the ending is out, all the tension is gone. However, this film could definitely outlast that lifetime as a look into hubris and the triumph of some of the better parts of human nature.",Fracture

Starring the fantastic Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling, 'Fracture' is a brilliant crime thriller. The opening to this movie is so well constructed as we follow Ted Crawford (Hopkins) secretly watching a couple as they frolic in the sun and the pool at a hotel. When he returns to his home we discover that the woman he was watching is his wife and he raises a gun and shoots her. When the police arrive, one of the detectives on the case is, yup you guessed it, the man she was having the affair with. All the facts are shown to us, we watch as Crawford shoots his wife, we watch as he readily confesses, we see the lead detective retrieve the gun from him and all seems straight forward, it would appear that Crawford's fate seems obvious right? Well, to Willy Beachum (Gosling), the young deputy DA who is assigned to prosecute him, this also appears to be an open and shut case, however following some clever twists and surprises in court, and the apparent lack of evidence, a battle of wits ensues resulting in Willy's obsession to see him proved guilty. This is a very clever and compelling thriller, and there are some very witty moments. The performances from the two lead actors are seriously impressive. Ryan Gosling plays this role so well, his character is a cocky hot shot lawyer and you really get that his focus, at first, is not really on this case. It seems so open and shut and it's his last case with the firm he is with before he moves on to a bigger and much more prestigious company, and that is his focus, but as the case progresses we see his determination, focus, and ultimately his ethics, take a turn. Hopkins is, as always, magnificent and the way he portrays Crawford with such a cool, calm and actually quite witty confidence is actually quite creepy, and you find yourself really rooting for Willy to get this guy put away. There are some great stand-out scenes and the reveal to the court of the detective's affair is so well done and the way that Gosling reacts you could almost think that he, the actor, didn't even see it coming.

My biggest problem has to be Anthony Hopkins, I really can't take the guy seriously since ""Silence Of The Hams"", sorry ""Lambs"", it's all Hannibal Lekter cheese with an accent that flips from English to Welsh, and then bizarrely Irish!

I'm sorry to say that while the two stars shine bright as ever, the movie itself is as dim as can be. Hopkins steals every scene he's in as Teddy Crawford, an aeronautics engineer who spends his free time playing with strange Goldberg-esquire contraptions (they serve no purpose other than being strange, shiny objects upon which Kramer Morgenthay's camera can lovingly linger) and spying on his philandering wife (Embeth Davidtz). When he catches his wife having an affair with a cop (Billy Burke), he shoots her, then immediately confesses to the police. A hotshot lawyer named Will Beachum(Gosling, speaking in a Southern drawl that gives his character some personality) is assigned to prosecute Crawford in court. It appears to be an easy case, but soon, pieces of evidence start disappearing from the scene of the crime, and Beachum begins to realize just what he's getting into. It's an episode of 'Law and Order' stretched to movie length and with a stronger cast (Dennis Straithairn and Fiona Shaw are strong in their supporting roles). Hopkins makes his character a full, three-dimensional human being, making him despicable and sympathetic at the same time. Gosling manages to give his character, your average Upwardly Mobile Lawyer, some heart to go with his cockiness. Gosling and Hopkins chew the scenery in the few scenes they have together, but instead of giving them meaty words to feast on, the screenwriters simply throw some cliché phrases (""Everybody has a breaking point) in with heaps of legal mumbo-jumbo. The two actors do their best with these morsels of appalling dialogue, but in the end, even two of the finest actors alive cannot save this bloated, dull movie from itself.

When the police arrive, he confesses and hands in his weapon, and the case is passed on to hotshot DDA Willy Beachum (Gosling), who sees this, his final public service trial before he moves onwards and upwards, to be a slam-dunk case; but alas, thanks to Crawford's mind games, things are not what they seem and the case undergoes a series of twists and turns as Crawford and Beachum engage in a tense battle of wits.The most obviously noticeable thing about Fracture is the how well-polished it all is. The whole thing looks so...expensive. The cars are expensive. The phones are expensive...even the cutlery during the Thanksgiving dinner scene looks expensive. Beachum seems to wear a new suit in every scene, and even the outdoor location shots look glossy; South California looks like it has been lacquered up especially for the camera lens. It's all very smooth, well edited, cleverly shot, and well-paced, but without these two actors, this movie would have been nothing more than a glossy second-rate courtroom ""thriller"". Hopkins and Gosling take it to the next level with great lead performances. Hopkins clearly enjoys playing this sort of manipulative role, controlling events, making sly remarks, and winking in that very obviously shifty way, and he gets to drive flashy cars and live in a big house while he does it, which I imagine only increases the amount of fun he has. Similarly, the cockiness arrogance of DDA Beachum allows Gosling to strut around, make wisecracks, and generally be a smug git. While the Hopkins-Gosling clashes make the movie, they are ably supported by David Straitharn, Rosamund Pike, and Billy Burke, who all inject a bit more life and background into the film.While the ride is comfortable for the most part, Fracture slips a gear towards the end; the shift from murder mystery to moral crusade feels a little bumpy, but nonetheless, strong performances and great artistic direction make Fracture a stylish, clever and enjoyable thriller that's definitely worth a look.",Fracture
184,andy-933-696608,Fracture Movie Review,6,10 February 2011,"Everything in life has its own breaking point, the very weak spot that further motivates that certain something to crumble and shatter. Whether it's an object of fragile delicacy, or a person in general, there is always that weak spot where the damage inflicted can result in one ultimate change. ""Fracture"" may not be thrilling, but it's very straight forward with the characters and their very desires. Anthony Hopkins plays Teddy Crawford, a man who's very breaking point has a long been broken after the discovery of his wife's affair with another man, a cop no less, thus shattering the hopes he had for their marriage. His patience, as well his very ability to manipulate the situation become apparent soon after he shoots her in the head, wounding her into a coma, and setting up a trial against a young and upcoming attorney named Willy Beachum (Gosling) who's peaked his very interest. Maybe it was Willy's noticeable arrogance, or the very simplicity of his youth that gave the coldly damaged Crawford the appetite for his presence. All I know is, from the very moment Willy accepts this case as an easy win, the battle begins, only for Willy to be slowly losing more than what he bargained for. His own promotion from Criminal law into Wooton and Simms, as a more corporate profession serves as both a distraction, and an eventual loss, as Teddy's manipulation of various technicalities in our legal system humiliate Willy into closed corners. Even his new romantic relationship with his Boss Niki (Pike) is not enough for the big wigs to notice a small fry who can't handle a supposed open and shut case. We all saw Teddy unload a .45 caliber on his wife's pretty little face, and yet the evidence isn't incriminating enough to a man who's confiscated Glock 21 was never fired. The fired bullets fit the type, but not the exact gun. Teddy's confidence as well as his clever wit, display the intricacy as well as the very inner damage his character is experiencing at the hands of betrayal. Hopkins displays a coldly manipulative character who planned this all to the end, and like I said earlier, his very point of fracture has been broken for a long time. He discovered his wife's infidelity only recently, however based on his demeanor in the beginning, the suspicions alone were enough to damage his psyche into making the very decision of executing what came to be a mastery of discovering multiple weak points in our Law System, Willy's own situation, and even his eventual appeal for freedom. I know it's seems crazy, but hey so is our law system. It has so many technicalities that even a man completely inexperienced in law, can learn just enough to find the cracks of his scenario, and break them further more. In Teddy's case, his wife's infidelity went on with the very man who arrested him, thus making the evidence null and void. In the case of a human being, a point of fracture can be motivated by anything, greed, selfishness, anger, envy, or just about any emotional response. In Teddy's case the very anger towards his wife's betrayal broke whatever kindness he had for her, creating a monster. In Willy's case, I think he had reached his fracture point, and that itself changed him for the better. His two time loss in the case helped him clearly see the very damage he'd committed with his overconfidence, as well the overall concern with his own career. ""Fracture"" in a way serves a much greater purpose, beside the fact of it being a courtroom thriller. It also seems educational, in displaying just how flawed the United States legal system can be, and how it's easily manipulation can explain that. Crawford's personal display of using ""The Fruit of The Poisonous Tree"", and his very own mastery of the various loop holes show just how easy the system can be walked over with simple knowledge. I don't plan ruin the ending for viewers, because when I mentioned just how lacking in thrill the film is, I didn't feel the need to spoil any more of it, just because I didn't see this film as horrific as Hopkins's character makes it out to be. However, I can comment that I was very entertained by the performances of the characters, and the very plot of the film. A man shoots his wife, willingly admitting it, yet still fighting for freedom, using diligence and overall confidence, showing just how intricately intelligent the story can be. Crawford may not be Hopkins's most terrifying character, however his nearly soulless, and calm demeanor serve as his strengths in showing the very damage that signifies this clever character. Gosling's performance is impressive through his cocky and yet slowly developed transformation. He started out with a complete understanding of how the world works in the nature of his profession, but once witnessing his mistakes and the result of them, his own moral conscience improves as it is brought to question. I wish I could've enjoyed this film more, but the way it presents itself in evoking reaction of fear is weak, and quite frankly I believed it could've done better in that area, when it clearly displayed great performances, a terrific exploration into the very weaknesses of our legal system, as well as an interesting moral result for Gosling's character's morality.",Fracture
185,Abhinav009,Decent thriller,8,21 September 2019,Fracture is a decent thriller. Anthony Hopkins was my attraction to the movie. The plot is well-written and well-executed.

186,a-little-squeek,Not even a better CAST could heal this FRACTURE.....,1,16 August 2007,"Sir Anthony Hopkins could not save this tedious, dubious, pretentious drivel, even though he plays to his strong suit as the disturbed protagonist. His character is one that we know so well from performances in things like the ""Silence of the Lambs"" series.I was bored to death and had to keep pinching myself to keep from falling asleep. The storyline is laborious, dialog poorly written. The lighting is very shadowy and plays like a cheap horror movie, it's difficult to see what's going on in the scene. The scoring is rife with suspense tones, there's no let up on it. Not EVERYTHING is suspenseful! Character development and interplay lack credibility. The screenplay is amateurish. The ending felt contrived and made me roll my eyes and groan in disgust. In short, I could not find one redeeming quality to this film. I'm giving it 1/2 star for the film and 1/2 star because I got to see it for free at my buddy's house and didn't have to pay for the rental.If you really must rent this turkey, wait 'till November, a little closer to Thanksgiving.",Fracture

I could write a long review about the film but I realise it wouldn't be that different to what others have already said about it, so my only criticism goes to Anthony Hopkins.I enjoy watching Anthony Hopkins. I really do. He is a brilliant actor and deserves all the credit he gets. However, his acting seems rather repetitive. He is always assigned to play the role of a man who is highly intelligent, mysterious, always a man of wisdom. Yes, this makes him an interesting character to watch, but we have seen it so many times. The funny thing though this never gets boring. So, I guess, hats off to him for his ability to make us watch the same character over and over again.Would I watch this film again?

191,imajestr,Mediocre plot saved by great acting,6,25 February 2008,"I was expecting a little more action and a little more suspense from this one. The trailers I saw seemed to imply a sadistic main character that truly enjoyed destroying the life of Gosling's character. The movie, however, ends up to be a battle of wits through courtroom procedure. The bulk of the film followed Gosling's character and his struggle to choose between justice and vanity/wealth while trying to win his last court case before moving to a new firm. With the new firm looming overhead, can he concentrate on the case at hand and put a psycho where he belongs, or will he eventually choose the vanity of the new firm and work for bigwigs suing bigwigs? This is the moral center of the film, and it ends up being the focus for a long time. Hopkin's character remains in the background for most of the movie, and even the final ""confrontation,"" if you want to call it that, is not all that suspenseful or intense.Overall, don't expect what the trailer's imply the movie is going to be, it's not all that intense, nor is it a very dark film. It's more a character film, and thankfully for the makers, Gosling and Hopkins are a couple of the best actors out there. Without them, I think this movie would have been a total dud, but they knew how to make the best out of what might have been relatively flimsy characters.Six stars because the acting was great so the characters were well played, but the directing was nothing more than standard and the plot fell relatively flat by the end.",Fracture

One happens to be a police hostage negotiator who happens to show up when the woman he's been seeing has been murdered.2) There are two guns on the scene when the body is discovered by police. For the entire length of the movie the investigators never think to check out one of those guns to see if it's the murder weapon.3) The district attorney's office is given a single long weekend to come up with extra evidence in an attempted murder case when a witness is compromised.

195,alexdelliott,a slow but clever thriller,8,14 March 2012,"STORY: Fracture manages to succeed where other films like it have failed spectacularly many times over. Ted Crawford shoots his adulterous wife in the head and waits calmly for the police to arrive. He had the gun in his hand and made a signed confession. On the other side is a slick lawyer who has finally made his big break into corporate law, this is his final case and it very well could be the one that breaks him when he realises that there is actually no evidence to convict Crawford. The film creates an ingenious plot that, while slow in parts, keeps you guessing until the very end. Character development was this film's strongest aspect. The only issue was the lack of progression in some parts where some pointless padding techniques were used rather than advance the plot. 3.5/5EXECUTION: As seen in films such as Silence of The Lambs, Anthony Hopkins is spectacular as the ingenious sociopathic antagonist that you just have to love. Similarly Ryan Gosling portrays the arrogant lawyer trying to rush through his last case and leave it behind. Most of the supporting cast are good enough to hold their own. There is no real action in this film but it doesn't need it due to the clever directing and style that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the last few minutes. 4.5/5VERDICT: Overall a good film with very few flaws. Best of all no clichéd ""hero and bad guy"" and no ridiculous Hollywood action or effects. This film relies on the talent of the actors and they do not disappoint.

I wasn't expecting anything wonderful to come from this film but by the end, I found myself pleasantly surprised.The film centres around Anthony Hopkins' character who murders his wife when he discovers that she is having an affair with a police detective. Even though he readily confesses to the crime, he has absolutely no intention of going to prison for it. Instead we see him manipulating the system to weaken the case against him and we gradually discover how much planning and thought he put into a shooting that initially seemed to be random and spontaneous.The prosecutor (played by Gosling) is an arrogant and cocky assistant DA who thinks that because he has a confession that the whole thing is locked down and secure. But he has severely underestimated Hopkins and step by step, Gosling gets his legs cut out from under him.The only complaints I will make about the movie is that in order for the story to work, it relies on huge leaps and improbable events. I won't spoil one of the big twists but basically one of the story's mysteries is how they can't find the murder weapon. When you finally realise what Hopkins did, you realise that in real life, something like that would be a real stretch to pull off. Second, how could Hopkins know in advance that the investigating detective would be the one that his wife was having an affair with? Out of all the detectives in the NYPD, Hopkins immediately knows which one he will get. I don't think so.If you're prepared to overlook these leaps of credibility, this is an enjoyable movie and Hopkins is just fantastic.",Fracture

When Gosling's boss (aka his conscience) tells him, ""If it makes you feel any better you let a man get away with ATTEMPTED murder,"" I (along with many others I am sure) knew how the movie would end. But it was not true to Hopkins' brilliant character that he too would have thought of this major loophole. A man who ingeniously constructs such an intricately plotted way to get away with the crime doesn't think about the fact that he can be tried again? Not buying it.I spent a lot of time criticizing this one fatal flaw, but overall I am still giving the movie a 7, because the rest of it (with the exception of the tepid romantic subplot) was so good and so effective.

The latter has some very annoying personal ticks in his acting style. Perhaps, he thinks this makes him seem real. It makes him look kind of stupid. How did this dope get through law school, let alone get a job with the LA DA's office? And nevermind his being courted by that high-powered law firm! That was completely unrealistic for a character like his with a annoyingly detached view of just about everything. When he did flare, it was seemingly out of character.Hopkins, meanwhile, sleepwalked through the part and outshone everyone.

This film has a bad case of jerks, where just about every character in this movie is a jerk and hard to relate to especially Mr. gosling for his arrogance and cockiness causes a lot of his issues throughout the movie. Not really sure how he went from not giving a crap when Hopkins character wanted to defend himself to wanting to find out where the weapon is there's a lot of missed steps as far as motivation in this film. Miss Pike plays gosling's boss and part time lover and is the damsel in distress in the film with a cringey family dinner scene that is just filler and we get a lot of that throughout the film. A lot of the second act is pointless scenes where Ryan gosling's character shows off his arrogant personality which this does not extend the character any. I don't see how Hopkins character was able to get away with a lot of the things that he could. I'm not blaming the actors for I feel like the writing was very weak the chemistry between gosling and Hopkins character really goes well together especially in the climax. I feel as if the writer had a great conclusion to his story but they could not find anything that was too well written for the first and second act because again the climax is clever, well acted and written.

My explanation follows: (I've put the ""holes"" in quotes.)""I didn't understand why Crawford fired the pistol through the window. What was the purpose of that and didn't this provide ballistic evidence when those bullets were retrieved?""The point of shooting through the window, (after he heard the voice of the landscaper) was to create an situation requiring the calling of the police.""Crawford had to check the make of the Nunally's sidearm well in advance to purchase an identical pistol."" It's not that difficult to find out what sort of guns cops carry. He had undoubtedly used a private investigator to find out that:(a) his wife was cheating
(b) who she was cheating with
(c) find out all he can about the guy she was cheating withHe had been in their room the day of the shooting. It's not a stretch to assume he might have been there on an earlier occasion, and thus could find out exactly what kind of gun the cop carries.""Is it possible that Nunally might have noticed a difference between his personal sidearm (nicks, scratches, general feel) and the ""identical"" replacement weapon?""The gun was in a holster. When he picks it up, it is in the holster. Most of the gun is concealed in that holster, with only the butt exposed. He sees what he expects to see. He would have no reason to expect that it is not his gun.""Why didn't Nunally (or anyone else) think it unusual that the murder weapon was the exact same pistol that he himself carried?""Glocks are popular.""How did Crawford know that his wife would not have divulged her identity to Nunally at some point in their liaison?""He didn't. This could be considered a hole.""Assuming that the only ballistic evidence was in the wife's head, how could Crawford know in advance of the shooting that it would not simply pass thru, at such close range, or that the bullet could not be surgically removed or that his wife would not have died from the shooting? Any would provide ballistic evidence that Nunally's pistol was the murder weapon.""They would have no reason to compare the bullet to Nunally's pistol. He did take a gamble on this, which he ultimately lost.""The big, big hole. How did Crawford know that Nunally would be the officer arriving on the scene? Is he the only homicide detective in town? It all falls apart if anyone else shows up.""Nunally wasn't just a detective. He was a hostage negotiator. This position requires additional training/skill. He undoubtedly discovered this fact when he had him investigated. This is why he shot through the windows, to create what would have been perceived as a ""hostage situation"".""Raised by Gosling, but unanswered in the plot, why did Crawford remove his wife from life support when he could have simply left the country for good as a free man.""He erroneously believed he was home-free, after having been acquitted.Another reviewer posited the following:1) A man and a woman have an affair, and never get each other's last names. One happens to be a police hostage negotiator who happens to show up when the woman he's been seeing has been murdered.He doesn't ""happen"" to show up. He is brought to the scene because of a potential hostage situation. Prior to Nunnaly seeing the body, the police do not know that she has been murdered.2) There are two guns on the scene when the body is discovered by police. For the entire length of the movie the investigators never think to check out one of those guns to see if it's the murder weapon.This is because one of those two guns belongs to the cop. They didn't think of the switch. They're not all Columbos.3) The district attorney's office is given a single long weekend to come up with extra evidence in an attempted murder case when a witness is compromised. Anyone who's ever been involved in any aspect of a real murder case knows how laughable this is.I can't argue this one, since I'm not familiar with California law. I would imagine, though, that if you have no admissible evidence in a case, the case might well go south.4) A hospital agrees to a man's Do Not Resuscitate request for his wife the day after the man has been acquitted for attempting to murder her. No one intervenes on behalf of the wife, no family, no friends, no victim's advocates, no one.We don't know if there was any family. The hospital adjudged her case as hopeless. He might also have had some power of attorney for medical decisions.5) A man who has planned out a brilliant scheme for getting away with murder, covering every last detail with psychotic foresight, neglects to read the fine print in the Double Jeopardy laws and carelessly re-implicates himself.The reviewer is correct on this one. It is difficult to imagine that he would not be aware of this. I knew, as soon as he pulled the plug on her, that this would be his undoing.One reviewer complained that the double jeopardy law would have protected him. That is not the case. Attempted murder and murder are two different sections of law, with different statute numbers. When the wife died, a different charge applied, and he could be retried.Just my $0.02.",Fracture

206,andydreamseeker,Movie Review: Fracture,6,19 April 2007,"The definition of the word ""fracture"" means to break. If everything has a weakness then that weakness shall be where it can fracture. Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins), the meticulous structural engineer claims that if looked closely enough, we can find a weakness in everything. He said it in such devious terms when he looked into the eyes of Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling), his prosecutor. He had found Beachum's weakness. Beachum is cocky, egoistic and doesn't like to lose. With the prosecutor already having his feet on the clouds, Crawford has found the perfect opportunity.Crawford had shot his wife, confessed to it and refused a lawyer. This is straightforward for district attorney Willy Beachum, the defendant had confessed, the evidence gathered and witnesses called upon, the scale is weighing heavily in his favor. This is after all his last case before his big move to highly reputable law firm, Wooton Sims. An easy case, a great new prospect and a gorgeous new boss (Rosamund Pike) waits in the horizon. Things could not be better, brighter and simpler. Only thing is it is not. If it were then the film means nothing.This is it. The fracture. The law states ""Innocent until proved guilty"". The evidence, the gun that Crawford shot his wife with ended up useless. It has never been fired. The key witness, detective Rob Nunally (Billy Burke) who took the confession off Crawford was nullified. There was reasonable doubt that the detective had threatened the defendant into confession. Detective Nunally had an affair with Mrs. Crawford (Embeth Davidtz). Without new evidence, Ted Crawford would walk free. The table is turned.Willy Beachum can end up with nothing. He could have walk away but he wouldn't. He wants to win. But how could he? He has nothing to prove Crawford shot his wife. He has to make a case out of nothing. He wants to prove that he can win. Things can only get more interesting or worse.I was waiting to see what happens next. Could Beachum prove that Crawford shot his wife? More importantly could Fracture prove to be dramatically suspenseful playing on the aspect of legal technicality? It looks increasingly like a fracture to Fracture as the case wears on.More questions were raised but without an increase in intensity to the drama. I'm not sure why Crawford did not tease Beachum more. Maybe Anthony Hopkins did not want to awake the Hannibal Lector in him by playing the psychology down. Beachum with his career on the line could not master enough desperation and emotion. He looks surprisingly unbreakable. The only guy who broke was detective Nunally. It was quite unbelievable.No evidence, no evidence and no evidence. The story is clever, but it was not clever enough. As with all suspense movies, all will be revealed towards the end. That part is undisputable. The only thing is there really should been more tension. That should be how the game should be played. But there was too many of Gosling and too little of Hopkins. I would have love to see more of Rosamund Pike and Billy Burke who are in their own right terrific actors. Scenes where they appeared, the temperature raised. When the two of them gave up and left the running entirely to Gosling, it somehow signaled a bad last stretch right to the end.I saw the fracture so to speak. And it left me broken. The film told a certain truth and proved it.""If you look close enough, you'll find everyone has a weak spot."" Sigh.",Fracture
207,tetractys,Awful movie with great production values,3,20 April 2007,"Remember the Fractured Fairy Tales from the Bullwinkle Show? Well, if you do, linger on that thought for a few moments and you'll garner far more pleasure than if you drive to the megaplex and watch the newest incarnation of Hannibal Lecter, aeronautical engineer, taking on one of the new kidz, Ryan Gosling, doing his twitchy Diane Keatonish imitation of Steve McQueen as Bullitt, but without the action.In fact, the movie is devoid of any action at all that isn't not only predictable, but juvenile. This movie never reaches above the Weekly Reader level in terms of plot, characterization, motivation or devices. Five minutes into the movie, I knew the Big Secret. Ten minutes in, I knew this was going to be a long slow ride with no bumps or fresh air. It's a flaccid copy of Jagged Edge, but without the jagged edges. It's the Postman Rings Once, Then Walks Away. Even the big visual motif of the rolling ball machine is never explored satisfactorily. We see a sidelong image of a ramp, then parts of a wheel, but never get to see the ball do anything worth watching. Kind of like a Goldberg machine constructed by Rube's untalented brother Fredo.The backstories of Hannibal and Diane are inane and tired at best. Hopkins plays an engineer whose wife is carrying on with a cop in such a manner to facilitate his revenge fantasy. In fact, the very basis of this fantasy is fantastic, and I don't mean that in the good sense. It's beyond belief. So many coincidental states of being are piled into a heap at the beginning of this fifth-grade writing exercise that one more would cause the entire mess to break through to the basement where the nursery school kids are studying Grimm. Example One: the cop is a hostage negotiator assigned to the district where Hopkins lives. Example Two: the wife and cop don't know each other's last names. Example three: the cop leaves his gun lying around when he plays with the wife.Gosling is conveniently trying to leave the prosecutor's office and join a corporate law firm, which adds bulk to the movie as pulp is added to orange juice. It's supposed to be good for you, but isn't really very pleasant. The loose plot threads this allows to be picked up are so nebulous that the cloth is in danger of ripping through at the slightest pressure like flimsy truck-stop toilet paper, giving the film-goer a nasty case of brownfinger.Facilitating the plot mangle are such miserable devices as these: when the wife is shot in the face with a Glock .45, she doesn't die; the homicide detective and Gosling happen to use the same model cell phone (which triggers the lamest Eureka moment in the history of cinema); Gosling spills coffee on his suit right after his tux is delivered for the party he's suddenly invited to that happens to be at the Disney Center and this all allows Hopkins to suddenly divine Gosling's ""point of fracture,"" from which the movie takes its name (and makes no sense), like the ""tell"" scenes in Rounders and Casino Royale; and finally Hopkins, devilishly clever and brutal, happens to need to talk a lot for some reason.I could go on and on, taking perverse pleasure from dissing this awful movie with great production values, but that would allow it to take up too much of my time, and it's done enough of that already in the mere watching. I thought Grindhouse was a hoot but not worth another attendance, being a concatenation of two lousy movies in an amusing fashion, but I'd rather sit through three hours of that movie a second time than watch this one for the first.I'll end on this note -- Fracture would be a modest movie of the week on television if this were still the 80s. It could be an episode of Murder, She Wrote. It could star Raymond Burr and be popular among older viewers. But it can't be a good movie in 2007. Why it's being so well reviewed is not really a mystery to me, just a disappointment. Even the Hill Street cameo in Fracture is pointless and unsatisfying. The best part of the experience was watching the trailer for the remake of Hairspray with John Travolta taking Divine's role as Edna Turnblad, and Michelle Pfeiffer as Velma von Tussle.

208,DrGlitterhouse,Succinctly Rendered,8,3 June 2007,"Neither the ad campaign nor the pre-release buzz did this film justice. ""Fracture"" isn't a knockoff of ""Silence of the Lambs""; it's more of a cross between ""Wall Street"" and ""Columbo."" Ryan Gosling is a deputy district attorney on his way out the door to take a job with a prestigious corporate law firm when he's assigned the case of Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins), an airline executive who's shot his wife. Focused on starting his new job and thinking the case is a slam dunk, Gosling is blindsided by the defendant (who, like Columbo, isn't as clueless as he affects to appear) and becomes determined to win the case and, perhaps, regain his moral compass.While director Gregory Hoblit's TV roots are showing in some of the early transition scenes (e.g., the drawn-out introduction of Gosling's character, pointless skyline shots), overall the cast and crew deserve high marks for delineating the characters and their motivations as succinctly as they do. With basically two scenes, they manage to paint a portrait of the airline executive's wife and elicit sympathy for her situation, despite her being an adulteress. We're also given a good sense of Ted's manipulative nature and why he does what he does. David Strathairn, as the district attorney, manages to cut a patronly figure within the confines of an elected official having to deal with the political ramifications of a failure to convict. The movie is lean and streamlined without leaving the viewer feeling cheated.""Fracture"" is as much about the choices its characters make as it is about foiling the bad guy.

In my book there really isn't an excuse for this behaviour although shooting someone due to this type of indiscretion is a bit over the top :) Where I felt the movie let itself down was at the end where Crawford, who plans things down to the minute detail, slips up over the last hurdle which was quite an obvious one.

Anthony Hopkins, Ryan Gosling and Joe LaBruto all pull off stellar performances in this character-driven how-to-prove-who-done-it. The plot device is simple. Engineer Ted Crawford (Hopkins) shot his wife. We saw him do it. He made very little effort (apparently) to hide it. Surely an Assistant DA headed into big time private law firm will have no trouble proving it. What the ADA, Willy Beachum, does not realize is that one of the first responders to the apparent hostage taking and shooting at the Crawford home was detective Robert Nunnally, whose affair with the shooting victim is what drove Crawford to commit the crime in the first place. The cat and mouse between Beachum and Crawford game that ensues requires strong acting performances to carry the story along. Fortunately, Gosling was up to the challenge of appearing alongside Hopkins. The two men played off one another brilliantly and moved the story along to its foreseeable twist ending. The subplot concerning Beachum's contemplation of the lucrative offer from the gigantic law firm, complete with romantic interest, is not so well done, but generally this is an entertaining film carried by the spell-binding interactions of the two leads.",Fracture

Fracture is so contrived it makes an old Perry Mason TV show look brilliant by comparison. The film starts out good (even if you accept Hopkins is married to a woman who could be his granddaughter)and seems like it might even be fun. At least Hopkins seems to be having fun, but this is not The World's Fastest Indian where the fun goes with the story. This is supposed to be about a murder. In any case, Hopkins beats the young D.A. in a game of wits so easily one wonders how dumb you have to be to serve as a D.A. in Los Angeles. Then there are tortuous scenes, full of convoluted reasoning and twisted logic, where this mentally-challenged young man figures out a way to ""catch"" Hopkins. The denouement is -- again -- so contrived as to make one long for the days of deus ex machina. And if you want real torture watch the so-called alternate endings on the DVD. They clearly demonstrate this movie never had any chance of succeeding. Besides which, a good attorney would easily get Hopkins off again.

Besides the boring factor, Anthony Hopkins' performance is well worth the 10 dollars as it is. We have seen him do amazing stuff in SIlence of the Lambs, Atlantis, etc. and he delivers a kick in the face again in this one. Just splendid. Gosling's job is not that hard so he does a pretty good job as it is. He is a great actor but his job in the movie was not that hard to do. Mostly he was acting tired. As far as the story goes, it is pretty unique because you can consider hopkins the villain but there is no real hero or villain in this story which kinda makes it a twisted mind drama/psycho thriller and the story line is pretty good except it goes pretty slow and can get boring for most.

There were a few funny moments, which lightened things up a bit at the beginning, but that was as good as it got, unfortunately. What little courtroom time there is has no suspense and little drama.The plot was fine, and one keeps waiting for the star prosecutor (Wally/Gosling) to do something to catch the eluding bad guy Ted Crawford (Hopkins), and plenty of opportunities and strategies do come up, which makes us get all excited.*** SPOILERS *** But everything the Wally tries ends up wrong, and the bad guy gets away. Well, not quite. Towards the end of the movie, Wally's boss makes a comment that makes Wally go ""Duh!"" and he takes it from there. But for the movie's sake, it is too little too late.I also wondered how did Ted know that Rob (Billy Burke) would be the one to investigate the 'attempted' murder?

There has to be an engaging story.The story begins swiftly enough. Hopkins shoots his wife in the opening minutes for her philandering, and there is no question in the viewers mind that he did it. Everything hereafter is a game of chess. The problem is that although it looks like he is going to get away with murder, everyone knows early on that he can't because, well, it would not be right. So there is no surprise. (How can any reviewer here spoil a Hollywood formula flick?) So the performances are sufficiently good, and the music appropriate for the moods, the end result is flat.

The main credit for this goes to the two main characters (Ted Crawford and Willy Beachum) played brilliantly by Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling. David Straithern does an admirable job in his small role of Gosling's 'soon to be former' boss.The main suspense is about the murder weapon. I thought in one scene the secret was given away, but no real damage was done because the story is more about the cat an dmouse game played by the two main characters. The change in the personality of the young lawyer (Beachum) is very believable..... from being a hot shot attorney who is about to leave the public office for a high paying law firm, to a dedicated public servant who wants justice done. Ryan Gosling has once again performed brilliantly. Hopkins is creepy, as his character demands it. The supporting cast is good.One major flaw IMO was about Beachum and his new boss (played by Rosamund Pike) flirting and getting in bed. That was totally uncalled for.

What sort of boss throws themselves at the new hire and risks their whole career? It really felt tacked on to try and fill out an otherwise simple story.

225,erikpsmith,Utterly implausible -- but other than that...,5,23 December 2010,"Okay, it's been three years since this movie came out, and I'm finally catching up with it, but...I guess you can say that I'm disturbed a multi-million-dollar Hollywood feature, something that people spent, oh YEARS of their lives making, would have at its core a plot so utterly unbelievable.The plot depends on contrivances and coincidences, and the legal point upon which the final twist turns is so questionable that it really needed to be explored and addressed. If you're with me so far, I'm sure you must have seen the movie, and believe me, I don't want you to read any further unless you have, because I'm about to give the whole thing away.But since you've seen it, I feel safe in saying that the final plot twist has something to do with double jeopardy. And if it provokes this legal layman jump up in his chair and say, wait a second, double jeopardy doesn't work that way! -- and if a thousand lawyers on the Internet say the same thing (they do) -- you know there's a problem. Look, even if the movie was right about this plot point -- let's say there's something quirky about the law in the state of California that makes double jeopardy work differently there than it does anywhere else in the country -- the problem here is so obvious that it should have been addressed, just to keep people like me from jumping out of their seats.But the problem runs far deeper than that. Why on earth does Anthony Hopkins choose to murder his wife in such a complicated way? Seems to me that there are a thousand easier ways to go about these things.The scheme itself doesn't make any sense, either. How could Hopkins possibly know that the investigating officer would be his wife's lover? How could Hopkins assume that he would have a chance to switch guns and reload without being seen? And let's take that one a step further. How could he assume that only one police officer would come inside, and that this one officer would breach every standard of law enforcement protocol by being dumb enough to set down his pistol and leave it unattended while an armed psycho killer stood a few feet away? How could Hopkins know the exact make and model of gun that the detective was using, so that a switch could be made? Some folks say they figured out the gun-switch angle right off the bat. But I didn't, because I didn't think anyone would be so stupid as to write something like this.You know, basic and obvious questions like these bother me -- and they really destroy the movie-going experience. I have to wonder if the original script made more sense, and the producers meddled with it somehow, and then maybe it all got rewritten at the last second to cover up botched plot holes or something. Anyway, it just doesn't work.And that's a shame, because the rest of the movie is so good -- the main character's backstory, the fine acting, and dialogue that sparkles in places.This is the kind of movie where maybe you ought to have seven or eight beers first before turning on the DVD player, so you won't bother thinking about anything.

So artistically I have to give it 6 points ... well for believability, only 1 point. For that reason, even if it's a good thriller, I'll zap it the next time.Hopkins (Engineer Crawford) as always, is a genius in this film. Ryan Gosling (Prosecutor Beachum), looking to win an easy one, will have the fight of his career. The connection Beachum do between to 2 cell phones and the 2 guns is impressive. Details could change life's.The scenario, wisely, don't focus on huge evidences, drowned in the acting game, but if you stare, the strategy of Hopkins (to get away with murder) depends on unlikely conditions. To succeed, his plan depends on:1. The presence of Burke (Lt. Bob Nullity) the bedfellow of Crawford's wife, to arrive first on the attempt murder scene.2. Nullity entering alone in the house of Crawford to negotiate (if other cops had enter the house, as usual, it would not have work, unless you replace Hopkins by David Copperfield)3. Nullity agreeing to leave his gun on a table (hum...)4. Nullity blindness to Crawford moves (exchanging the guns on the crime scene)5. Nullity ignorance of the name of his bedfellow ?6. Incompetence of Nunally & the investigation team, not controlling the evidence. Even if the guns are the same made, it's improbable that you would not see some differences between your own gun during a few months, starting with the serial number ? These elephant facts will be obvious only at the conclusion, so you'll enjoy the movie till the end, almost.Other concerns: a) Why Nunally decide to shoot himself right in the Courtbuilding when Crawford is freed ? Surely not because he's mourning his ''mistress'', he doesn't even know her name. Concerning justice, he has nothing to fear, not even some roughness during the arrest of Crawford. I suspect maybe a dick transplantation, but the film is not explicit about it.b) Why is it impossible to find other bullets, except the one in the Crawford's wife head ?c) Why did Crawford shoot three other bullets through the window ?d) Beachum obtain a court order preventing Crawford from pulling his wife's life support, but become hysterical and arrested with the papers in his hands... by the way, not completely unrealistic but for a soap plant.",Fracture

This movies is about Hopkins's half-baked plan to commit a perfect murder, beginning with sneaking into the hotel room while his wife is at the pool with her paramour and taking the cop's gun, leaving his own (same model) in it's place.He shoots his wife once in the head at a time when he knows the cop (a local) is on duty. He's the first one on the scene. He enters into dialog with Hopkins. They both agree to put their guns down. When the cop sees who the wife his, he goes hysterical. At that moment, Hopkins switches back his gun for the cop's.In retrospect, that's where the whole thing falls apart. 1. The odds of one man being able to orchestrate something like that perfectly are about ten billion to one. He had no way of knowing whether the cops would swarm his house, break in or demand that he come out. 2. He certainly should have made sure his wife was dead, but she wasn't.

In the opening scenes it reminded me of the 'Columbo' TV series where the murderer is seen by all doing his/her nasty work and then has to be caught out by a superior being. Anthony Hopkins is excellent, but gives nothing extra to his usual 'controlled but I might erupt at any moment' performance which he does very well and he fits snugly into the role. However, as miscasting goes, as miscasting does, Ryan Gosling, cast in the role of the superior being, looks as if he should be in a teenage skateboard film worrying about his acne as he gets ready to attend the local dance hop. Instead he tries very hard to do a wet vague impersonation of Marlon Brando, or was it James Dean, and comes out looking like he has been grounded by his parents for not doing his homework. What the love interest was between him and Rosamund Pike was all about I just do not know? Or was it even necessary?

I am going to watch Meeting Joe Black later today.The genre is exciting: thriller, court room drama, mystery. I was excited. The movie starts with the scenes that set it for battles to come. Anthony Hopkins looked deadly- the polished, rich, smart, billionaire psychopath. Psychopath is an extreme term. I think he was looking for some sort of rush. Hence the cold murder. Further, he was damn confident-you may call it arrogance- that he'd get away with any thing. His acting was brilliant. Those complex machines added a depth to his character. Complex, well thought, and a mystery to everyone out there. Enter Ryan Gosling.A rising lawyer in world of criminal law. Young, full of energy,honest, carefree until he get the murder case involving Hopkins. His world turned around. Everything starts going downhill for him from there. Hopkins kills him in court, and that takes a toll on his career and private life. Gosling eventually loses the case, and Hopkins walks out. I think the plot was decent.The final set up to trap Hopkins was good, but the writers and directors did not give their audience an opportunity to guess the plot or be thrown away in a different direction, and later arrive at the truth. I thought Gosling waiting by side of the woman in comma was also lame. It was his only choice before the cop shot himself. The plot was uni-directional and bland, but decent. I think acting by both Hopkins and Gosling carried the movie. Definitely a one time watch. But this movie had the potential to be a classic, but somewhere in between it fractured.",Fracture

The plot, whilst not exactly original, was strong enough to hold the attention all the way through. And I enjoyed having a situation where the 'good guy' was an unsympathetic character. In all, I thought the performances - particularly those of Hopkins and Gosling - were excellent... Hopkins especially. I have to admit that, with a few exceptions (The World's Fastest Indian and Proof amongst them) I've never rated him very highly as an actor. I must be one of the few people who thought he was miscast in The Silence of the Lambs: I thought he hammed it up so much that it detracted from the sense of menace he was supposed to convey. Not so in this film. Here, that sense is very genuine and palpable. Excellently done. My only criticism, I suppose, is that I twigged the ending about half-way through, which rather spoilt it.

The most important facts are in fact ""Motive and Opportunity"", so it makes this film into a total joke for anyone who understands the slightest about circumstantial evidence, and just how powerful it is in our legal system. The AD's character is completely unbelievable in that he would subject his entire career to this case when he has the ability to let the case pass to another attorney. The Anthony Hopkins character is completely unbelievable as well, that if a man that smart decides to take revenge on his cheating wife that he would subject himself to a lifetime in prison if his plan falls apart in the slightest?. A man this smart would understand that there were much better ways to do this, than the method he chose. The biggest courtroom moment was when Hopkins blurts out that the investigating detective was having sex with his wife, when in fact this piece of evidence would be much more condemning to him since it provides motive. Also, what were the chances that this cop would show-up to handle this case? This is LA we are talking about!! This movie is a JOKE! And a total insult to our intelligence as viewers.

He is then prosecuted by the hot-shot attorney named ""Willy"" Beachem (Gosling), however the evidence in the case does not add up and Beachem has no choice but to let him go.Aside from Hopkins's brilliant performance, the story was unrealistic and disorganized, and the film was peppered up with high tech gadgets, fast cars, sketchy camera tricks and angles, and also brief and unclear character introductions. What made it worse was that the film drowned in a void of bad acting, even by Gosling himself. Only be interested in his looks ladies, if you look at his acting, you'd probably be disappointed.Other then that, the film was a surprisingly humorous thriller that had the ill reminisce of a Hannibal Lecter film. And it just so happened that the attorney's name was ""Will"". I had a flashback of Red Dragon, the prequel to Silence of the Lambs that was released in 2002.Not to mention, there was no major twist in the film, so it left you feeling somewhat like you just wasted your $7.50 when you bought the ticket.Other then that, it was an interesting thriller.

I expect this film's rating to decrease a lot over time.

The gist is that someone wants to find a murder weapon. He looks for it a lot. Here and there. And there. He asks about it. He looks some more. He asks someone else about it, and even has one long, boring conversation about it twice in the film. Tedium soon set in.. There's too much concentration on the individual characters and a story with potential is ruined by a lack of ability to follow through.

The actors, the crew, the audience.The script has a nice, tight little package showing how Crawford got away with it. Leave it alone. Just walk away. But, NO! They couldn't do that could they? Even the movie ""Double Jeopardy"" got it wrong. The legal rule of double jeopardy applies to not being able to be tried twice for THE SAME CRIME! In ""Double Jeopardy"" she was trying to correct a mistake of the court system (see ""People Will Talk"" 1951 which will properly explain the whole thing.) When she killed her husband for a second time, it was a DIFFERENT CRIME  no double jeopardy applies. Now ""Fracture"" comes along and says now that she's dead we can try you all over again. Guess what? They can't! It's still the SAME CRIME! Just because you now have a different result doesn't make it a different crime. If this were true everyone who had ever put someone in a coma and then the victim died some years later could be retried. They can't. Why couldn't the filmmakers invest in one hour of a criminal attorney's time? It would have saved them lots of grief.And what's this business about claiming ""now we have the bullet?"" So what? All that proves it that the bullet came from Detective Nunnally's gun. Crawford says ""I don't know how he did it but somehow Detective Nunnally shot my wife. It's his gun. Oh, the video of me going into their hotel room? That's not me. Prove it."" And just how was Crawford supposed to pull this slight of hand trick with switching the guns back? Their guns were twenty-five feet apart in the ensuing scuffle. Remember, they each laid them aside before talking? Are we really supposed to believe that Crawford ran to the front door, switched the guns and ran back again while Nunnally was agonizing over the body? Possible maybe. Plausible no.Beacham's futile attempt at a stay on pulling the plug on Crawford's wife  why didn't it occur to him to use the telephone? A call from the District Attorney's office saying ""I have a stay and it will be delivered shortly"" would in real life have been enough. Just drop this whole part of the storyline. It makes no sense.Speaking of making no sense, what happened to Nikki Gardner? She just melted away.The excuse that Hollywood has a responsibility to show that crime is always punished? Hundreds of movies have broken this code since the early fifties. So what's new? Other than that, good movie.

And it was somewhat interesting, but mainly for the degree to which it apparently makes little senseLook, I have no medical or legal background myself, but common sense tells me that the fact that Crawford had initially been tried for attempted murder and yet would be given the right to pull the cord at any time should have at least raised questions right from the start. Now, you can say that since he was acquitted, nothing could stand in Crawford's way. But if a doctor has said that ""she probably would have outlived both of us,"" to more or less quote Beachum talking to Crawford, at the very least there should have been far more controversy over allowing Crawford free rein. Alright, that's a little fuzzy and good for provoking conversation, but will anyone with a legal background explain to me how Crawford could be acquitted of attempted murder charges and consequently be allowed to pull the plug on his wife and yet now be charged with murder on new grounds? Of course, there's new evidence, and of course, the charge will now be murder (not attempted murder), so double jeopardy is avoided. But the point is, how can pulling the plug now so conveniently be considered murder when the doctors allowed him to do it in the first place, presumably based on medical diagnosis and opinion, and presumably within the limits of the law?

Mine were with the villain. Because Mr. Hopkins was the best actor? Perhaps. But perhaps moreso because his character was the best drawn, the smartest, and the most emotionally complex.Before he shoots his wife, who has just returned home from a weekend's assignation with her lover (who later turns up as the policeman dispatched to the house as a hostage negotiator), Hopkins' character tells her he loves her. She, cold as ice, tells him, ""I know."" Her lover, in the scene just before, had just told her pretty much the same thing, and her response had been equally cold.So, I had no sympathy for her.Her policeman/lover is cheating on his own wife and kids, responds unprofessionally at the scene of the crime and by taking Hopkins' confession despite blatant conflict of interest, and later plants fake evidence. He came off less as a distraught lover than an unscrupulous and incompetent sleaze.I felt no sympathy for him, either.And then there is Beachum, the lawyer: smug, conniving and ambitious. The best that can be said for him is that he refuses to take the bait of the faked evidence.But he seemed much less smart than he thought he was, and so I wasted no sympathy on the lawyer, either.Hopkins' was the character I was rooting for because Hopkins' was the only character with any depth, with more than a single dimension.I wanted to see him prevail and was extremely disappointed when he did not.And I don't usually side with the bad guys. I never sided with Mr. Hopkins' Hannibal the cannibal, for example. And I don't see the similarities that some reviewers do between that role and the one he plays in this film. I believe that if his wife had said she loved him, or seemed in any way conflicted, he would not have shot her. No, I only side with the bad guys when their motivations are actually honorable, for this truly was a matter of ""honor"" in an old-fashioned sense, and/or when the good guys are no more than cardboard cutouts.All in all, Fracture was nowhere near as well written or as satisfying as an episode of Law and Order.But it's a huge credit to Mr. Hopkins that he did not simply phone in his performance in this film as Sam Waterson so often does on L&O.

259,chrisvoffshore,Hopkins-aided TV schlock,5,26 April 2007,"With a title like ""Fracture"" and a star like Anthony Hopkins, I expected a taut, high-end classic thriller.Instead, I rather got the feeling that the movie was put together by talented but lazy people who treated their audience with the same disdain that the Ryan Gosling character (Beechum) had for his final prosecuting case.It's simply not good enough to have gaping plot-holes at this level of feature movie-making. We can all forgive weak writing, or less than brilliant directing and acting from time to time, but it's not nice feeling taken advantage of just because the movie makers knew they had Hopkins on board playing his stock-in-trade psychopathic killer, and could then get away with any old TV-derived schlock.SPOILERS:If nothing else, the movie should have set up how the Hopkins character (Crawford) would know for sure that the officer who was screwing his wife would be the same one to investigate the shooting at his home. Also, how could she not die when shot in the head at point-blank range with a Glock .45 by a man as cool and competent as the Crawford? Fracture's various plot-problems have been well documented by other reviewers on this site, so I won't draw attention to them, other than to inquire as to the relevance of the girl - at all - and the rolling-ball contraption? I find it ironic that a complex metaphor like ""fracture"" is used alongside a gaping plot. (I still don't really understand its relevance in the movie, but maybe I'm a bit dumb.)I'd also like to make a confession:I was rather sorry that the Hopkins character got nailed at the end. I had gotten to like him and, to compound my disappointment, I didn't really believe the (predictable) ending. Crawford was far too clever to be caught out like that. It would have solved a whole bunch of plot problems had he got off. It would also have introduced a theme into a theme-less movie: That you can't always make up for lost time if you didn't do your job with heart and soul when you had the chance. This, ironically, is the theme that the movie-makers of Fracture will take with them as their picture disappears into the morass of unremarkable celluloid.",Fracture

261,lionmoonfilms,A boatload of cliché has ruined this great plot-driven movie,4,28 October 2012,"It has a promising start, that an old eccentric but brilliant engineer (Anthony Hopkins) killed his wife with coolness and precision, and a neat set up, that he knows what he's doing when the detective shows up to disarm him. Then it goes downhill ever since, starting from the entrance of an attorney from the D.A. Office (Ryan Gosling).It's too pity. Either the director or the actors ruined a great story by insisting on so many clichés in the movie. And worse yet, it has a tendency to drag out every cliché for as long as possible just make sure you recognize it as such. It's so boring that the ""hero"", the public prosecutor who's about to cash out, has to stay in the hospital room with a brain-dead victim time and again; or to drag his secretary to the court house for a childish gimmick just to dwell on the infinite time span of not doing the gimmick after all; to move the heaven and earth to save the brain-dead as if he has become the biggest pro-life phony in the shortest period of time; or to come to ""aha"" moment so conveniently that you don't know to laugh about it or curse; the list, as they say, goes on and on. If they cut all those craps, and really tighten up the pace of the story, then you might see a great movie in the caliber of The Silence Lamb, which I presumed why Hopkins had taken the role in the first place. He had a fine performance, but also very predictable one, which is another way to say, it's boring. And boy, the ending has to be the outcome of the test audiences' feedback (or maybe confusion) to make sure the justice being served. But sadly, by the time that the bad guy had executed a cold-blood nonetheless perfect murder and that the good guy had acted like a brain-dead, you couldn't help but root for the bad guy.

262,Tyler_Seymour_Wallach,Lecter is back.,7,20 April 2007,"This over used concept of a murderer getting through the legal system, causing mass havoc among the opposition, was actually not as cliché as I thought it would be. Sure, it has basically all of the elements that makes a decent, clichéd murder story, but it also has a few things most of them don't have. For instance, excellent chemistry with the 2 predominant characters, this resulted in the story being much more interesting, and therefore resulted in a better product. Another instance would be a few of the nice little plot twists at the end, and how it wrapped up so well. Through and through, this original screenplay by Daniel Pyne and Glenn Gers, was average at most, with a few exceptions. Gregory Hoblit, the director of the film, did a very nice job devising a well made film, that contained a great atmosphere, as well as a good take on the decent script.If you go into this film, expecting Anthony Hopkins to be lead, think again. He is in the film about as much as he was in Silence of the Lambs, give a few minutes. Though even with this minuscule screen time, he achieves what many actors cannot, in a full leading role. The intensity and wit of the Hannibal Lecter seem to have stuck with him, because he delivers a performance within that range, yet again. Mr. Hopkins also has a lot of those scenes where it wouldn't feel right if it were just anyone in the role, because he has this presence with him, that is just so dreadful, yet friendly at the same time, very creepy indeed. David Stratharin isn't as major as I would've liked him to be, such a talented actor in a role that could be as short as 12 minutes, though what he does with those 12 minutes is pretty impressive nonetheless. The way he can inflict the cold hard truth upon someone, in such an honest, yet cruel way is just brilliant. Billy Burke is basically the clichéd detective at the scene, with a temper... how original. Rosamund Pike is alright, I suppose. There isn't really much to critique on her. She delivered her lines well, some of them came off really cheesy, and that's never good. But the lack of chemistry Gosling and herself had, was made up by Hopkins and Gosling, for sure. Now the for the true lead of the film, Ryan Gosling. With a variety of emotions, and good character depth, portrayed to a tee, he is consistent with his performances. See, the thing with Gosling is, you really cannot anticipate what he will do with the character, which always makes it a treat to see him perform with such heart. He often had such facial expressions that would leave you laughing, intentionally, and it's always good for some tension to be shut away by some comedy. Overall, the dynamic duo were exactly what all Thrillers need, true emotion.The technical aspects of the film were seldom effective. The film constantly riddled with a barrage of reused and remade ""spine tingling"" scores. The loud bang before a moment of possible terror was used once or twice in the film, which just made me roll my eyes in displeasure. The film editing was pretty good, not much to ponder about it though. Nothing really to take the viewer to different times, and places seamlessly. The art direction was very nice, with the limited creativity they could of had with it. Beautiful court room, outside of the Court, the lovely mansion, and the busy lawyer firm. This also coincided well with the costumes, which were manly just comprised of suits, and dresses. The best technical aspect of the film without a doubt in my mind had to of been the Cinematography. This was brilliantly done, and definitely a contender for the end of the year. Going story to story, from near the pool to the inside of the house, it was just so beautiful to watch.",Fracture

The movie is how you come to change your first impressions about people. I would not give the plot here(many comments have already done that). These were some of my take aways from the movie.* Never get complacent and overconfident. Smart people like Ted Crawford can look into that and utilize that weakness pretty well.* There is always a loophole. Look for it like Willy looks for the gun.* Sometimes, there's no better thrill than just putting a stake through the Bad Guy. Money can never compensate for that feeling.At the end, i would say that the movie is really well written. One example is the following exchange between Willy's boss and Willy as he is about to leave for a private sector job.BOSS: You really belong here.WILLY: With all due respects ,sir, I didn't work all this hard to stay where i belong.Plus that poem Willy reads to the comatose victim in the hospital and the lines about ""The most useless time of them all, The Waiting time"" really ring true.I really cannot recommend a movie higher.

268,Michael Heide,"The first 80 minutes are fun, but it goes downhill from there.",4,21 November 2007,"This movie doesn't work on several levels. Spoilers to follow. If you haven't seen Fracture, don't read this review. And Spoilers for Ocean's Eleven to follow, come to think of it. So if you haven't seen that movie, don't read this review. But back to Fracture: Here we have a brilliant man who has thought of everything to get away with murder. Let's believe that he actually can see the weak point in everything and everybody. Let's believe that he predicts what seems like random behavior and coincidences. Let's believe that he was lucky and even the unpredictable factors played to his advantage. Why would he miss the obvious hole in his plan? It just doesn't make sense. Either he's infallible, then he would have wiped his fingerprints off the bullets in Nunally's gun and he would have let his wife live... OR he's not and his whole plan wouldn't have gone as far as it did in the first place. But having him set up as the man who could beat the devil himself in a chess game - only to let him stumble over such a stupid detail... that's just sloppy screen writing.On another level, the casting works against the movie. Anthony Hopkins plays the role with diabolical delight. He is by far the most charismatic actor in the whole film, and his character is the most intelligent person as well. And in letting the victim have an affair with the unlikable lieutenant, the audience has a hard time not to identify with Hopkins. In a way, the film makes it seem like he deserves to get away with murder. Especially in contrast to the arrogant young lawyer, a cocky young a-hole that would sell his own mother to get that high-paying job at a soulless law firm. Now nothing against Ryan Gosling, I think you need a lot of talent to intentionally be that unlikable. But it should be consistent. The film didn't need a Saulus-to-Paulus change. Beachum had his chance to come out as the winner (actually, he had that chance twice), but he blew it out of arrogance. Letting him win kind of defeats the purpose.The first 80 minutes are a wonderful film. The arrogant young lawyer loses his job, the betrayed husband gets away with murder thanks to his superior intelligence. And he should. But then the film continues. And the whole thing falls apart. Imagine Ocean's Eleven if George Clooney and his gang got caught in the end? It just wouldn't work. And neither does Fracture.",Fracture
269,mbajnr,Total pretentious let-down- spoilers herein,4,12 November 2007,"This film irritated the living p*ss out of me. Full of pomp and hype, but ultimately totally lacking any substance or quality.The script is idiotic, the legal understanding is hilariously flawed, the acting is shambolic (only Hopkins, who i find increasingly one dimensional, exuded any charisma whatsoever), the plot contrivances are just ridiculous, the pacing is all wrong and the ending is one of the most dissatisfying i've seen in a long time.I get frustrated watching the Ocean's 11 remake and Saw 2-3 because I believe it's too far-fetched to believe that someone can predict with such precision the outcome of a course of events in which there are so many variables. However, Hopkins' character has an unfathomable command of almost every variable in the film (until the last 5 minutes when he inexplicably squanders it all for the dubious ending). A clever plot can only be really clever if it survives the examinations of some intelligent characters. Fracture relies on one intelligent character waltzing his way past a set of obstacles set up by the most negligent and idiotic 'smart' people i've ever seen.A man (an aeronautical engineer, we're told. There is no reason for this) discovers that his wife is having an affair. For some reason, though the adulterous couple don't know each others names. The engineer then point blank shoots his wife in the face. She doesn't die, which is remarkable; not least because the whole plot is based on this being an attempted murder and insufficient ballistic evidence. Because he fires two shots through a window, the police naturally send in a hostage negotiator (the adulterer! wow) who, neglects to mention any of the conflicts of interests he has in the case. Luckily for the engineer, the prosecuting DDA is a young hot-shot with his eye off the ball and on his new job, and later his pretty new boss (pointless). He is able to divine this from the fact that the DDA is wearing a tux, because he was off to a party after the trial but spilt coffee on his suit so .....It goes on and on in this fashion. Characters commit suicide without real mention, bosses make bizarre employment decisions, staggeringly glaring facts are overlooked by the police, while the murderer, by way of his 'Private Dick' (chortle) is omniscient.I am shocked that this has a rating of over 7.0.

It was way too predictable that the attorney secretly recorded the confession. At least Hopkins didn't resort to that silly old unrealistic Hollywood dramatic confession upon being pressed. Instead, he confessed as a form of bragging, which is probably more realistic.The ending leaves me with some legal quandaries, such as: ""can the recording be entered into evidence against the accused when it was gathered by the District Attorney""? I'm sure the author of the book was legally trained and made clear in the novel how the law operated, but the movie left out some of these interesting little legal explanations which could have been explained through dialog between the Assistant DA and another attorney.In any event, I liked this movie. It was entertaining and the storyline of the Assistant District Attorney getting hired at a law firm after proving his mettle in court was realistic. His turning down the job in favor of satisfying his pride and fighting another court battle is also realistic as some lawyers would do this.The least realistic part of the movie was the predictable ending.

The plot was intelligent, suspenseful, intriguing and totally unpredictable. The film was well paced and even included a few humorous moments, which were very well placed. This casting was excellent and the acting was flawless. Anthony Hopkins shares a unique trait with a very select group of actors, such a Jack Nicholson.

I would have loved to seen Hopkins character be already prepared for the final charge of murder and have just one more rabbit to pull out of his hat to get out of that too. Not that I condone murder but it's just a movie. He was seemed to smart to make such a grave mistake (no pun intended) and that was disappointing.

285,rachel-filmer82,Unfulfilled promise,6,10 January 2013,"I really enjoy a clever courtroom head-scratcher, but all too often the scriptwriter lacks the intelligence to resolve their ideas in a clever way. Unfortunately, Fracture falls head-first into this trap. Whilst watching the film, I came up with several ideas for how things might resolve - the reality being far more banal.I watched the film as part of a Ryan Gosling double bill on Film 4 - I think he's a promising actor from what I've seen, so I was interested to see more. Hopkins is usually great - the fact that his preparation is merely reading the script a few hundred times and arriving on set is a great middle finger to the high-maintenance antics of the method bunch. However, I find the fact that his accent changes at least four times per sentence increasingly irritated, and he pulled off some bizarre changes here (Texan to Irish to Indian in five words). Since the film focuses so heavily on these two characters, the rest are sketched broadly and supremely forgettable.The set-up is promising (spoilers ahead): we're watching Hopkins like a hawk whilst he cleans up after the attempted murder of his wife, trying to figure out how he's going to play this, since his wife has conveniently pointed out how clever he is (a nice telegraphed scene of painful exposition precedes the shooting). When it becomes clear that his wife's lover is the hostage negotiator, things become problematic.What if he hadn't been on duty? Although I can understand his initial shock and attack of Hopkins, why wouldn't he immediately recuse himself from the investigation? To be present during the confession is something a professional cop would never do - to then neglect to tell the DA of his involvement with the victim is simply unbelievable. Gosling's character gets a lot of abuse for losing the case, but the blame would have been placed with the lying cop.I was hoping for a mind-blowing explanation for the missing gun, to make up for the film's other flaws, but I'd dismissed the explanation within five minutes of his arrest as being too simplistic. Boy, was I wrong. We're constantly being shown a large piece of engineering created by Hopkins purely to transport marbles - these scenes implied some involvement of this device in the plot, but as far as I could tell it was entirely irrelevant (although by this point I was busy discussing how ridiculous the plot was becoming with my husband, so I may have missed something there). He made a smaller version for Gosling's character - why? I was honestly hoping that Hopkins has constructed a gun from small parts and taken it apart and carried the pieces amongst his belongings - that's how desperate I was for something more interesting than a swap.Moreover, we're expected to believe that Gosling would go into the house of the murderer to inform him that he had him - we're also expected to believe that this highly-intelligent villain would offer a full and graphic confession to the prosecutor without checking whether the conversation was somehow being recorded (the fact that he wasn't recording the conversation is also ridiculous, not that the conversation would ever have happened, so I suppose this is moot).Lastly, what was the point of adding the final scene, showing the start of the new trial before cutting to the credits? Ending with the arrest would have been far more powerful.Having said all that, Gosling is excellent and really holds his own against Hopkins (and he manages to maintain one accent, which is a bonus). He alone made it watchable, so I've given it 6/10. Don't expect to be blown away, but I suppose there are worse ways to waste a couple of hours.",Fracture
286,nikkitakatana,Ever watch a film that you thought was quite good?,3,13 October 2017,"Only to watch it again a few years later and think, ""what a load of nonsense!!"" This is definitely one of those films. I'm almost starting to feel a bit sorry for Rosamund Pike cos I seem to be making a habit of giving low scores to films she's in. But then perhaps she likes being in films with plots that rely on seriously bad police work. And a bad apple that thinks they're way too clever. Did anyone else wonder exactly which accent Anthony Hopkins was meant to be using? Cos there was definitely some Scottish and Irish thrown in with the Welsh along the way. That was very distracting.Anyway, first time I saw it I thought it was a rather well put together stylish thriller. Second time around it just appears to be a complete slating on the inadequacies of a legal and justice system.Then again, perhaps I'll watch it again another day and the cops falling for the cons ""cons"" might all make sense. But somehow I doubt that very much. A clever thriller should really have at least one really sharp criminal. Not one that's so clever he gets away with it first time only to give the cops all the evidence they need to put him away for a bigger crime later on. And, ideally, cops who can figure out if the murder weapon isn't at the crime scene then they need to eliminate possibilities and do some proper detecting work. And a guy who works his way up to lieutenant has a) no idea on the identity of the woman he's having an affair with and b) manages to get his gun swapped twice in the same day?With some films, the deeper you look, the bigger the fractures.

Ted Crawford, a meticulous-minded structural engineer, discovers his wife is having an affair with a police detective. Crawford proceeds to shoot his wife and immediately confesses over the crime. However at his arraignment Crawford retracts his confession. He then engages in a battle of the wits with a rising star district attorney Willy Beachum. Beachum quickly discovers his case is falling apart as Crawford outwits him at every turn.The casting of this film is exceptional, Anthony Hopkins plays his role very subtly and brings a dry wit of humor which does good for the film. Ryan Gosling as Willy Beachum works wheel with his part and delivers a strong paced performance, Billy Burke gives a versatile performance with his small role as detective Rob Nunally. Rosamund Pike does surprisingly good with her rather dull and uninteresting character Nikki Gardner and we get some other great performances by Embeth Davidtz, Fiona Shaw, Bob Gunton and David Starthairn.The film does a good job keeping the pace nicely flowing and there seems to be never a dull moment, and the climax of the film is played out very nicely and subtly where Anthony and Ryan really play their parts well.

Of course, the direction is highly different compared to Hitchcock's brilliant capacity in blocking and such. The dialogue is well-written as well.

297,Phat Beast,Could have been so much more....,6,22 April 2007,"The first 3/4 or so of Fracture are amazing. The acting is dead-on, the writing is solid, and the plot is done just well enough that it's incredibly entertaining without being either trite or pretentious. The story is simple enough: Ted Crawford (Hopkins) -- ostensibly an aerospace engineer who runs a successful company -- catches his wife having an affair and shoots (but doesn't kill) her. Being incredibly meticulous, he is able to plan every detail of the attempted murder to assure himself of an acquittal. Willy Beachum, Assistant DA handling the case (Gosling) is a hotshot who's on his way out the door to bigger and better things and, at first, neglects to prepare well for the case. The middle half of the movie is essentially the legal struggle between Beachum and Crawford. Ultimately, the overconfident Beachum is no match for the cunning Crawford. Toward the end of the trial, there is a scene in which Beachum must decide whether or not to plant evidence in order to obtain a conviction. The tension is palpable and the scene comes off as one of the best and most dramatic in the movie. In the end, Crawford is acquitted and, as he leaves the courtroom, his wife's grief-stricken lover shoots himself. This would have been an almost perfect ending to the movie, and would have guaranteed it at least an 8 or 9 rating from me. Up to this point, it was a solid film that was realistic, and just unconventional enough to stand out.But apparently that wasn't enough for the folks behind the movie. Unable to cope with his failure, Beachum takes a personal interest in Crawford's comatose wife. What follows is a ridiculous and clichéd attempt by Beachum to obtain a court order preventing Crawford from pulling his wife's life support. This portion of the film is unrealistic and filled with false drama. The story does not sell Beachum's sudden dramatic change of character well, and it gives little reason to care about what happens to the wife (her doctor all but says that she's almost gone anyway). Beachum fails to stop Crawford from pulling the plug (legally), but then in an even less believable sequence, realizes where the crucial piece of evidence was, and then extracts a confession from Crawford, who believes he's protected by prohibitions on double jeopardy. Using a seemingly flimsy argument, Beachum takes Crawford back to court. The movie ends, fortunately, with the new trial beginning, rather than a conviction, which, in my opinion, would have reduced its score even more.The acting in Fracture is fantastic. Though Gosling gets most of the screen time, Hopkins (as usual) steals the show. Strange side note: Hopkins seems to change accents throughout the movie. The writing and the plot are outstanding for the first hour to hour and a half. And the music is excellent (especially when Crawford returns home after his acquittal). What would have been a great movie is no more than mediocre or slightly above average simply because it tried to fix what wasn't broke.My Recommendation: See the movie, but leave shortly after the trial ends.",Fracture

My only complaint is that I could see through the ending and it did not make sense with the characters. If Anthony Hopkins character is so smart and brilliant to set up this elaborate plan to pull off a murder and get away with it, I think he would be smart enough to realize that murder and attempted murder are two different charges.

I have seen him being the bad guy so many times that I actually want to start every movie by putting him behind bars.The law related dialogues..too corny. Hollywood is going on the path of illiterate cinema. They give corny references (A good year, Pursuit of Happiness), extremely corny incidences. Just telling how much they are away from the reality. Honestly they should remain away from subjects and dialogues which they have no clue about or better consult a real professional. Acting wise David Strathairn has done a splendid job.

The film looked good visually and the leads (Hopkins and Gosling) were outstanding. That is all that kept me watching.The plot was barely worthy of an hour TV episode on a crime show. The pacing was very poor and there was very little tension created. T I Hopkins' touch of Irish accent worked well to suggest a hint of madness. He did a very good job of developing the character of Crawford without much help from the script. His expressions, use of accent and movement from playing dumb, at his first hearing, to later behaving like a well schooled lawyer was entertaining to watch. The different acts that Crawford put on left you feeling as if something was not quite right, in a sociopathic way perhaps. Hopkins said that it was his idea to do the accent, based on a the psychotic overtones he could get out of it. Id have to say that it worked a treat.

At first it looks like an easy job to prove him guilty of attempted murder - the wife is in coma after the episode - because Crawford admits the murder to an officer and is proved to have been in the house during the crime. A young lawyer, Beachum (Gosling), leads the case as his last job before he changes work place, but slowly Crawford reveals that he's in control of things, his confession is declared invalid and the police soon run out of evidence. The story is expectable from the first scene, and the weak climax at last isn't especially thrilling. All in all the plot seems like a so-so crime novel that could have been a short Hitchcock movie.

I totally believe Hopkins due to his chilling and at times understated performance carried this film. The plot at times felt very weak and towards they end you begin to loose concentration on what they whole thing is about.Ryan Gosling for me looked out of his depth, he at times delivered a pretty good performance, but for they most part you could see that he lacked they on screen presence that is needed in a film of this genre. He failed to deliver the knockout performance that I was praying to see from him.The film was great fun but don't expect to be blown away, its full of light humour from an un-characteristic Hopkins who, as ever is a joy to watch and delivers yet another masterclass performance, I loved every scene he was in.

Trained to scrutinize aeronautical gremlins and plane debris, he's an expert in discerning the Achilles' heel of any system.The same applies to people, too. While in the film Hopkins feasts on psychoanalyzing and toying with people's minds, upon reflection he's swift to point elsewhere for an answer about his character's motivations.""I'm not a film scholar. I never analyze the ingredients of a good film,"" Hopkins said in the film's production notes. ""I never go into a character's subtext. Ask the writer for the reasons why someone does something.

And as always, Hopkins puts in a grand performance, stealing every scene he's in. Bravo again, Sir Anthony.However, the rest of the movie just isn't up to the task. Maybe it's because I always appreciate Hopkins' work as a villain (e.g., Lecter, Hitler, Nixon, etc.), but I had no sympathy for Ryan Gosling's character and had no interest in seeing him win. The subplot of his romance with his new boss was downright childish. No woman who had risen to that level of power in a key Los Angeles law firm would so quickly turn herself into a sniveling adolescent, least of all for this punk. And there are other holes in the plot which don't add up (e.g., how does Crawford know it's going to be the RIGHT GUY who shows up and comes in to investigate the shooting?).The screenplay is also weak, and sometimes suffers from shooting for the least common denominator. Hopkins' line of ""My dick has information"" and several subsequent lines about ""my dick"" this and that sound very forced and more suited to a ""Beavis and Butthead"" audience. And at the denouement, the best line they could come up with was ""Get the f*** out of my house""? If you're a Hopkins fan, go see it.

I have not seen any of his previous films, but on the strength of this I probably will not bother. His character (along with many parts of the film) was terribly clichéd and predictable. At no point did his actions surprise me, and his cocky lawyer personality did not endear me to him at all.Overall, in my opinion, Fracture tried too hard to be clever, without ever really getting there.

First off, Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling acted superbly in this film. I'd be very surprised if neither of them gets nominated for an award this year. As for the movie itself, its very cleverly written and unique as it teases the viewer whether or not the murder will be solved ---- everyone knows who the killer is, now how do you prove the crime was committed? Nevertheless, there are some plot points that I don't think really needs to be there (I didn't get the significance of Nikki's role in all this) and I was hoping the movie will (somewhat) explain the relation between Ted Crawford's psyche and the sophisticated contraption (as is common to most psychological thrillers, where usually the smallest things play a significant meaning in the movie).

However (SPOILER)....I figured out early on how/why they were unable to find the murder weapon. I knew he had switched his gun that had never been fired for the officer's gun, used the officer's gun to murder his wife and switched it at the house when they set it down. I knew that because he disclosed right away he KNEW that was his wife's lover when he came for hostage negotiations. He had planned it. So, when the murder weapon was never found and they had searched the house the first time, I told my husband I felt he had switched the murder weapon. Turned out I was right, but that ruined the entire movie for me. Because I kept waiting for Gosling's character to figure it out and so the movie just wasn't fun for me to watch. In real life, I highly doubt a lawyer that was THAT good would have taken that long to figure it out when I figured it out pretty quickly.I wasn't 110% certain I was correct until the cell phone scene where the identical phones were switched. That was what the lawyer needed to figure it out and I knew right when the two phones were next to each other and the second it rang that would be it, that would be what he needed to figure it out. I was right again, too predictable.I also knew the officer's suicide would some how play in to finding the evidence, I just wasn't sure how. I was not suspecting it would be that they would match bullets and him pulling the plug on her was what would really do him in, because I didn't know the bullet was still lodged in his wife's head, I thought they removed it. For a while I was thinking the wife would wake-up and blow the whole thing out in the open, but that didn't happen. But otherwise, the movie was quite predictable. I don't understand how it got so many stars, did most people not figure that out?!?!?I will also say, I doubt a man THAT smart would overlook the double jeopardy thing.

How did Crawford know that his wife would not have divulged her identity to Nunally at some point in their liaison?

What a year for him- nominated for his first Academy Award for his powerful role in Half Nelson (which was excellent- go see that too) and now puts on another pitch perfect performance in Fracture. I don't think this performance will go unnoticed, and he really proved himself as one of the best actors in his generation. Amazing.And what about Anthony Hopkins? He was nothing less than excellent for his role as the psychotic Teddy Crawford. I think that there will be no fans of Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal disappointed by his performance. Very creepy.Not only is this film packed with drama, excitement, and suspense, it is also dusted with just enough humor to make it one of the most supremely entertaining movies of the year. Hopkins' quick wit and Gosling's humor jump off screen and brings the whole audience to many laughs.All around, Fracture is a superior psychological thriller that keeps you guessing. I loved it, and I'm sure millions more will too.*p.s.- about an hour and a half into the movie, watch David Strathairn's character when he goes to Beachum's house. His car is parked in one direction, and then when he goes back to it, it's in a completely different direction. i just thought i'd throw in that goof. =]*",Fracture

I want to be very careful here to not give anything away but this movie really is great fun. If you're looking for a reprisal of Hannibal Lecter, forget it. Lecter has his charm; here Hopkins' character is as cold blooded a killer as you'd never want to meet. But there are moments that are screamingly funny and that is vital for a good suspense film. Don't go to see this film if you want to be scared; that's not this film's forte. The strength here is the plot twists and the way Hopkins keeps toying with the DA's office. No deep thinking here, but a very clever plot. The best news is that the film doesn't cheat. Take a couple of hours off and go see it. It's fun.",Fracture
338,rob_vln1,Most reviewers didn't understand the characters,8,6 May 2008,"This was a well-crafted film -- somehow everyone who didn't like it just didn't understand the characters in the movie. All the plot ""holes"" are quite explainable in the movie's context. For example, many complaints I read were about how Crawford ""knew"" that Nunelly would show up at the crime scene with the same gun. If those viewers were paying attention, they would have known that Crawford hired a private detective to ascertain information about Nunelly's job (hostage negotiator not homicide detective) and his gun. This enables Crawford to know a) what kind of gun to purchase, and b) that staging a hostage situation would draw Nunelly to the scene. If the situation had not lent itself to the crime, he would not have attempted the murder on his wife this way. The supposed coincidences that allowed the plot to unfold were a demonstration of Crawford's ability to manipulate events based on the research and planning he put into the crime. As careful as he was, Crawford did overlook the subtleties of what could happen after he pulled the plug on his wife, but that was the ""imperfection"" that he was unable to detect -- which ties in to the seemingly random story he tells earlier about the egg farm. It's easy to find faults if you constantly for reasons NOT to like what you are watching, but I prefer to enjoy the story and see how that the events fit the characters, which they do. I wonder if some of these ""critics"" like any movie that contains a certain level of complexity.",Fracture
339,chamona13,A near perfect film,8,26 May 2007,"Given the fact that Ryan Gosling constantly comes out with superb movies and gives remarkable performances, I couldn't help but worry that this film wouldn't measure up to my standards for him. I was wrong. This clever thriller is loaded with twists and turns, and keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling are outstanding together. They both deliver an astonishing performance, and you can feel the tension between them, as they attempt to outsmart each other.Willy Beachum, (Gosling) is a talented prosecutor with a 97% conviction rate. He uses this fact to score a job with the most high profile firm in the city. He takes on one last case as a district attorney before leaving that office for private practice. Ted Crawford, (Hopkins) shot his wife Jennifer, (Davidtz) after discovering that she was having an affair. He signs a confession, and requests moving immediately to trial. Furthermore, he insists upon representing himself. The only problem is that the gun Ted used for the shooting is nowhere to be found. Willy was informed that it was a sure to win case, considering the confession. He figured that the gun issue wouldn't make a difference with the confession as a safety net. Willy brings Rob Nunally, (Burke) to the witness stand, as the police man who arrested Ted. Ted reveals the stunning fact that Rob was the man having an affair with is wife, causing the confession to be useless as tainted evidence. Suddenly the sure to win case transforms into a mind game between Ted and Willy. Ted makes a living from finding flaws in aircrafts and now he's turned his attention to finding Willy's flaw. As Willy struggles to solve the case, Ted studies Willy to find and exploit his weakness, which Ted refers to as the fracture. They end up having the same fracture; the constant need to win, at any cost.This unique thriller goes in a direction I've never yet seen. It goes in many unpredictable ways, leaving the audience guessing. Before watching the film, I worried that Anthony Hopkins' performance would be somewhat of a repeat of his performances in so many other films when he plays the clever villain. However, he manages to bring some freshness and originality to the screen as an intellectual and manipulative criminal challenging Gosling. All of the actors portray their characters in a very believable way, (particularly Hopkins), and the supporting actors do a fantastic job in their supporting roles as well. It's not always 100% entertaining, there are slow times. However, the brilliance of the rest out weighs them. It's not purely for entertainment; it's mainly to make the audience think. In order to enjoy this film fully, you will need to be prepared to think. I strongly recommend this film if you're a fan of psychological thrillers, or if you're in the mood to watch a suspenseful yet pensive movie, that has a good twist. (Or in this case, many twists) To me, this film has almost no flaws, no fractures.",Fracture

To pull off a movie like this you need good actors and a solid plot and the writers failed to deliver on the latter.It doesn't take a lot of knowledge about law to be flabbergasted about all the implausibilities in the story-line which makes a theme like this very hard to digest. Ryan Gosling was hyped up as a highly talented persecutor and I was looking forward to see his performance in court, only to be disappointed by him embarrassing himself over and over again. He demonstrated no talent at all and seemed like a useless persecutor who just came out of law school. The poor writing made him look like a bad actor.The side plot at the new firm contributed little value to the movie and felt like a complete waste of time.As a detective Ryan was slightly less incapable. He spent nearly 2 hours trying to figure out what happened to the gun and finally put the pieces together in a series of rushed plot twists and the writers were probably crossing their fingers at this point hoping that the average viewer wouldn't notice all the plot holes.Even good actors can't save a movie like this and I feel genuinely sorry for Ryan.",Fracture

The bullet taken from the dead woman's body doesn't prove anything because there's no firm -- beyond a reasonable doubt -- evidence that Crawford actually did the shooting. The only evidence is Crawford's comments to Beachump toward the end of the movie. Was that indeed taped as it appeared to be? Is that what nails Crawford and lands him back in court?

However, I would have appreciated a *little* clue, even if it didn't represent itself as a clue. The flashback montage provided during the explanation contained scenes that were not even actual scenes from the film. The alternate ending where Beachum compares the photographs is easier to buy, but the theatrical ending depicts Beachum as pure genius. I agree, the love scene was ridiculous.

348,ffkiller,Not a bad movie for Friday night,8,20 April 2007,"I was late for the screening. The first scene I saw as I walked into the hall is how Jennifer Crawford and Rob Nunally are having a good time by the pool. As I slowly located my seat and put my body in a comfortable position, Ted Crawford shot his wife.Clueless about the shooting, I struggled with confusion for the next 10 minutes. Once Willy Beachum started to talk about his new shining career with a prominent law firm, while leaving district attorney office behind, the movie gets more interesting.Apart from the delicate play between Willy Beachum and Ted Crawford, this movie is also about a person's choice between glamor and justice. Portrayed as cold and indifferent towards the prosecution of Ted Crawford, Willy's boss Nikki Gardner repeatedly asked Willy to back out from the trouble and prepare for the total devotion to his new corporate career, which is absolutely correct if viewed from the business perspective - maximizing shareholder values.But conscience eventually prevailed inside the heart of Willy, leading to the dismissal of new career in favor of justice as well as the restraint from using fake evidence in court out of desperation. From the choices Willy made, you can pretty much predict a happy ending, with Ted Crawford successfully being tried for a second time, with a team of lawyers as what a rich man would have when faced with a murder charge, technically an attempted murder until proved otherwise.Plot aside, the sentence that triggered the most laughter in my hall is probably the one that involves private investigator ""dick"".Does anybody still remember the complete joke?",Fracture

If all the elements that constitute the second offense have not occurred at the time of the trial of the lesser offense, or the prosecution, using reasonable diligence, could not have been aware of all of these elements, the defendant may be tried later for the greater offense. For example, if the defendant injuries the victim, she may be tried and convicted for assault and battery, and may later be tried for murder if the victim dies after the first trial. However, even the victim's subsequent death would not permit a subsequent trial for murder if the defendant had been acquitted of assault and battery.Furthermore, the act of ""pulling the plug"" on his wife would also not constitute murder as it was done legally, (since he's still her next-of-kin and is allowed to make such decisions; ignore for now whether he might be denied such status, perhaps on the grounds that his culpability in her death could be proved by a preponderance of the evidence or even clear and convincing evidence, even though it wasn't proved beyond a reasonable doubt at the criminal trial).Therefore, Hopkins couldn't be tried again.",Fracture

Such a person would not risk life in prison or worse, on such an unlikely string of events. He'd develop another plan that had a higher likelihood of success. And either the movie makers didn't consult a competent attorney or they chose to ignore his advice. Crawford was found not guilty of the act of attempted murder.

When DDA Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling)finds out the gun Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) used to shoot his wife Jennifer Crawford (Embeth Davidtz)does not match the gun recovered at the crime scene it's very interesting. But when you learn Ted switched guns at the hotel so he shot Jennifer with Lt. Robert Nunally's gun and switched them back at the house this doesn't work. When they ran ballistic tests at the crime lab red flags would have been going off that a police gun was used in a shooting. Then you have Lt. Nunally talking to Willey about switching guns in the evidence room so everything matches. Problem with that is Willy has turned over discovery to the defense which should contain a ballistic report so if they switch the guns and casings in the evidence room you now have conflicting reports. Then you have the Double Jeopardy, Ted was never convicted of shooting Jennifer, he was released due to lack of evidence so double jeopardy never attached. Finally you have Ted on trial for murder because he pulled the plug on Jennifer. If Ted had the legal right to disconnect life support.........no murder trial and if he didn't have the legal right to disconnect life support the hospital would not have done it or allowed it to be done. If the hospital had let her be disconnected illegally they would have been sitting right along side Ted at the trial.If I'm wrong on any of this set me straight",Fracture

Perhaps the yanks didn't notice how bad his Irish accent was due to their lack of experience with the Irish. But, believe me as someone from northern england, it wasn't right. Well, not exactly, the accent itself wasn't wrong. But, it kept slipping. Sometimes it was really strong and pronounced and other times it wasn't even there. I think personally that this film would work a lot better on the small screen. I'm not sure why, and i don't mean that in a derogatory way, but to me it just felt like a TV movie.

This rival of Crawford's, Willy Beachum, is presented as a close to flawless prosecutor, but does nothing in this movie to live up to those expectations. Everything he does is senseless, dumb and hard to believe. Judging from his actions, it seems almost a miracle that he has a 97 % conviction rate (which is a strange statistic anyways). His last remaining bit of credibility is lost in the scene where he comes storming into the hospital to save the wife of Ted Crawford, who is in a coma and is in such a severe state that Ted Crawford is already LEGALLY allowed to pull the plug. It makes no sense at all that a district attorney, confronted on a regular basis with deaths, would place such emotional interest in a woman he doesn't even know and who has no prospects of having a normal life ever again. In that respect, the movie lost a lot of credibility. The subplot with Beachum's girlfriend and boss was terrible and not interesting in the least. As this character, Ryan Gosling did okay under the circumstances, but his role was awful. I can't believe he decided to do this movie.

370,isaac-many,"Starts off really well, then it's like the writers were too lazy to think of an ending",5,25 December 2020,"The beginning is very promising. A really good story with a twist.
I liked the idea of the viewers not 100% know who's the killer (though he is..)From the middle of the movie ahead, it's gets boring and it gets nowhere.
Of course we expect the mursurer to be caught, but there are so many ways to get there but this.Too bad.",Fracture
371,hassanmoghaddam,Smooth Twist,8,22 September 2021,"The audience take sides with Ted Crawford through the movie, but the twist at the end did not ruin this image. This smooth twist does not pull down the proud image of Ted Crawford, but gives us two heroes, one of which in Willy Beachum.By the way, you could just delete Nikkie Gardner and that would not affect the movie at all.",Fracture
372,the_gweilo,The best movie I have seen this year,9,7 August 2007,"I really enjoyed this flick. Anthony Hopkins was his usual terrific acting self. The plot was a ""grabber"" in the perverse way that it kept you guessing as to who was really the hunter and who was the hunted from beginning to end. And, until the very end we didn't know whether the good guy or the bad guy would win - or even (to me anyway) which one was which ! Anyone who enjoys this genre of film definitely will love this one. I watched ""Ronin"" the next evening and although DeNiro is one of my favorite actors it paled into insignificance compared to ""Fracture"" in all aspects.""Fracture"" is a flick that makes thinking men think but also at the same time satisfies the most simple couch potato's lust for the need not to.Yeah, I can't imagine anyone not liking this movie and I think it could be nominated for an Oscar or two.",Fracture

374,ashroom-19231,Intriguing but expected,6,26 October 2019,"Plot has been designed the way that leads you to two scenarios: 1) dark conspiracy crime 2) madness thriller. As you go through, you would choose one and hope that the plot will not be so easily guessed, but it kinda does (for me and my friend). I will say the plot is smartly designed and will engage you, but I do not appreciate the storyline in the end because I hoped it was a bit more complex (still think it's well produced and with good acting though).",Fracture
375,lavenderhillmobster,Sheer trivia but a nice little detail . . .,6,25 April 2007,"A stunning performance by Tony Hopkins, who actually manages to give us a different sort of psychopath rather than just re-treading dear old Hannibal. The film manipulates expectations and sympathies with devastating effect - the sheer reptilian awfulness of Beachum, coupled with the full-on verve of Hopkins performance puts the audience in a very uncomfortable, disconcerting place. A minor detail: the bundles of case-notes that are all over the DA's office - their front sheets all read 'The People versus . . .'. The defendants names are all members of the crew. I think the props manager was having a little joke with the director of photography . . .",Fracture
