0,MartinHafer,VERY uneven but worth watching for the story about the 2nd cop,7,21 September 2005,"The first 1/3 of the movie did absolutely nothing for me. Nothing at all. In fact, I was about to turn off the video when the very weird romance (?) story began concerning the cop who had been in a relationship with the stewardess. It somehow kept me interested and so I continued watching. The sheer bizarreness of the lady in the restaurant kept me watching. In fact, I laughed at quite a few of the STRANGE things she did--so much that my wife and daughter came over to watch as well. They asked me what I was watching and I honestly told them I didn't know! In the beginning, this lady spent all her time dancing to the same song again and again (and frankly, I was starting to get sick of the song California DREAMIN' as a result). Then, she became fascinated with the cop (why, we don't really know). So fascinated that she broke into his home. At first, she didn't do much. But, later, she began rearranging the house and even adding fish to his aquarium! It just kept getting weirder and weirder and it was strange seeing a lady who was less a stalker and more a lady who pleasured from living secretly in the cop's apartment while he was working! Instead of telling you more, I recommend you see it for yourself but feel free to SKIP the first 1/3 of the movie. I didn't find the first 1/3 interesting at all, but the last portion was captivating.",Chungking Express
1,gavin6942,Nailed It,8,7 February 2014,"Two stories, two lovelorn cops, two objects of desire: one a big-time heroin dealer in deep trouble with her boss after the cargo disappears, the other a seriously flaky take-out waitress who inadvertently gets hold of the keys to her admirer's apartment, all shot in a breathless kaleidoscope of color and hand-held camera work to create a mesmerizing portrait of Hong Kong in the 1990s.With the constant use of ""California Dreamin"" and ""Dreams"", do you think this is a film about dreams? In some ways, it is, and in other ways it is not.You have to give this film credit. Besides looking great and just being an overall wonderful movie, there are little things that really stand out in the writing. The ""May 1"" can idea, with the connection between birthdays and expiration... so clever.",Chungking Express
2,jboothmillard,Chungking Express,7,13 April 2007,"This is one of those films that I personally did not choose to watch, but I made myself because it was part of my Film Studies exam in the New Wave film topic. From director Kar Wai Wong, this is quite an interesting Hong Kong New Wave film with very inventive editing. The first half (well, actually almost only a third) is about Cop 223, He Zhiwu (Takeshi Kaneshiro), who has broken up with his five-year girlfriend, and he has purchased many tins of pineapples that all expire on the same date, May 1 1994. He feels that either he will rejoin his love, or the love will expire forever. The second half of the film (the other two thirds) is about Cop 663 (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) dealing with his breakup with his flight attendant girlfriend. He only talks to his apartment furnishings till finding a new local lunch counter girl, Faye (Faye Wong). Also starring Brigitte Lin as Woman in blonde wig and Valerie Chow as Air Hostess. Very good!",Chungking Express
3,paul_haakonsen,And the hype was about?...,5,23 February 2013,"Oddly enough it is not before 2013 that I got around to watching ""Chungking Express"", despite being a huge fan of Hong Kong cinema and having lived and worked in Hong Kong as well. The reason for this? Well, I just never got around to it, despite having heard all the good things about this movie.And now that I have seen it, I must say that this movie really wasn't one that stood out that much in my opinion. The movie just didn't leave that much of a lasting impression on me. Sure there were some really great scenes and some good ideas put to the screen, but overall the two stories told here were not just exceptional. The first story with the drug trafficking ring came off as too hastily put together, because there weren't any satisfactory ending to it, in my opinion. Whereas the second story with the police officer and the waitress turned out to be much more appealing for me, as it was funnier and had a more coherent red thread throughout its course.""Chungking Express"" is not the type of Hong Kong movie that will appeal just to anyone, it certainly didn't sit all that well with me, and I must admit that I have seen many more movies from Hong Kong that far outshines this one.I am not saying that ""Chungking Express"" is a bad movie, far from it. It is just different - story-wise, that is.As for the cinematography, well then they really did a good job here. The camera-work and the angles of the shots were just superb, and there was a very dynamic feel to the scenes in both the stories.Which leaves me to comment on the acting. As a fan of Tony Leung, I must admit that the appeal to the second story had a big part of him being in it, as he always do great jobs with the movies he is in. But also noteworthy here was Faye Wong - also in the second story. Personally, I have never understood the hype about Brigette Lin, but hey, a matter a personal preference, I suppose. It was a bit strange to see Takeshi Kaneshiro in this movie, but he did a good job with his given character.To me, ""Chungking Express"" was a fairly mediocre movie, though it did impress on the visual side, but it doesn't really stand out for me in an otherwise overwhelming market of Hong Kong movies out there. Hence I am giving it a 5/10 rating only.",Chungking Express
4,Quinoa1984,"I like to revisit this movie every now and then, like a quirky, quintessentially cool photo in a pineapple frame",10,9 January 2008,"One of Wong Kar Wai's most experimental features (and this is even for old Wong folks) is one of his earliest efforts, done while in a creative struggle making his epic Ashes of Time. Chungking Express is light and frothy, featuring funny monologues about the importance of pineapple preservation and a charming, aimless usage of Mama and the Papa's California Dreaming. It's about the search for romance in a city that is dark and dingy and full of holes someone could easily fall into. But what makes it so charming, and interesting ultimately in that European art-house way, is how Wong Kar Wai keeps a rhythm to his story that doesn't follow rules, but feels right in a sense like some off-beat song on an obscure album only your hip friend down the block has. I'm not sure who, in the end, I would recommend Chungking Express. Probably film buff friends who enjoy obsessions over pineapple and girls.There's also a very good performance turned in by actress Brigitte Lin, who before this was a (enormously popular) pop star, and is slightly used as opposed to cast by Kar Wai as a figurehead, like some flashy, self-conscious symbol of a mystery in and of itself (blond wig, going about the crevices of town on some criminal mystery, the music playing in tight but sweet strings). It's also great to see Tony Leung in an early role that allows him some space for some little notes of emotion we haven't seen in future Wong Kar Wai movies where he's the super-serious or melancholy lover. Not that there aren't moments of the melancholy in Chungking Express, but they're presented like it's the most important thing to the characters, and to the audience is, well, just another piece to their puzzle as a whole character. Little by little we see that this isn't much as a crime film in focusing on these two cops and this odd woman in a blond wig. Or even Fayes character. It's a question of what makes up these characters, when romance throws caution into the wind.I've seen Chungking Express in bits and pieces over the years, and while I will eventually get down and watch it from start to finish, all the pieces together (not to draw any sort of parallel in what I described and how I view the movie) stay fresh in my mind. I love revisiting the gil dancing to her own beat to California Dreaming, as if we're in the room too. I also love how Kar Wai flashes so many techniques into his story, the flashes of colors, the combinations and segues of film speeds and a kind of impressionistic style that puts up noir into a more emotional plane. It's one of the director's best.",Chungking Express
5,hitchcockthelegend,Expirary and new beginnings?,7,1 October 2008,"Chung Hing sam lam consists of two lightly attached stories of pop culture poems to the lovelorn. Director Kar Wai Wong nodding approvingly towards the French New Wave directors he so obviously admires, lays out his tale with visual flourishes filtered by a thought provoking distinction between things expiring and new beginnings. Chung Hing sam lam is a film that demands repeat viewings, I write this after only my first viewing, but scanning thru the user comments written already it's apparent that many people get many different things from the movie. With that then I can only say that new viewers to it will have to see it and come out with their own conclusions. Capitalism, love and even abandonment come hurtling together in this thought provoking picture, if it amounts to much in the bigger picture is open for debate, but there is no denying that Kar Wai Wong has crafted, well, a pretty crafty movie, a movie that personally had myself pondering sometime after the final credits had finished.The cast are uniformly great, Brigitte Lin is sultry and impacting, Takeshi Kaneshiro is emotionally adroit, Tony Leung is very classy, whilst Faye Wong steals the picture with a performance of great depth. The direction is stylish and the pacing is perfectly zippy, with the soundtrack doing just the job that the makers intended it to do, just don't ask me to ever listen to California Dreaming ever again!Judge for yourself. 7/10",Chungking Express
6,lastliberal,"A person may like pineapple today, and something else tomorrow.",8,19 March 2009,"Takeshi Kaneshiro (House of Flying Daggers) meets Brigitte Lin (Ashes of Time Redux) after a depressing month trying to get over his girlfriend. She has just lost a group of Indians smuggling drugs. He obsesses over her departure and misses on what is right before him. Things don't last forever. The use of frenetic camera shots and flashing lights make this segment a little hard to take, but still satisfying. You can't get caught up in the story because that is not what's important. It's the film itself that is the point. Just when you think something may happen, the story changes.In the second segment, Tony Leung Chiu Wai (Lust, Caution; Infernal Affairs) loses his girlfriend, too, but doesn't obsess, especially with Faye Wong (2046) available. But, he hardly notices her. She, on the other hand, spends time cleaning and rearranging his apartment without his knowledge.It is a film for film lovers. The medium is the message. Kar Wai Wong establishes himself as a true master of the art film.",Chungking Express
7,Boba_Fett1138,A Hong Kong love story.,8,25 July 2012,"Don't think that many people are aware of it but throughout the decades some pretty good movies have been released from Hong Kong. The movies are often more stylish and less restrained from lets say a Chinese or Japanese production. In a way they are more like Korean movies, which is good news to hear for those who love and are familiar with Asian cinema.And quite frankly, this movie is all about its style. Or at least it was for me. It's actually hard to believe this is a 1994 production, since the style and approach of it feels far more modern. This movie so easily could had been made and released this present day and probably would had been a bigger hit as well, seeing how popular Asian movies are now days.It's a very visual movie, with some amazing, innovative, camera-work. It truly makes the movie feel like a very lively and fast going one, even when there is not an awful lot happening with its story.The story is being more one of the subtle kind. It takes its time to set up things and all of its characters and doesn't ever force anything. It sort of lets the story work out as a realistic and sweet one. It's a love-story but truly far from a typical one. Watching ""Chung Hing sam lam"" is an unique experience, in more than one way.It might not be everybody's kind of thing but those who want to experience something different and more visual orientated shall have a great time watching this movie!8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Chungking Express
8,safenoe,You have to get it to get it.,10,11 March 2016,"I love Chungking Express.If you're into a movie for pro-forma plot line or how fast a car goes in Fast and the Furious or how many people are chomped on by dinosaurs, then Chungking Express isn't for you.Chungking Express is a movie to be experienced, to be savoured, to be enjoyed. Maybe it's because I've been to Hong Kong a few times and it's amazing seeing the sights incorporated into Wong Kar-Wai's vision and Christopher Doyle's cinematography.The ending was bittersweet but I loved the Cantonese rendition of a famous Cranberries hit.The atmosphere of Chungking Express is pure Wong Kar-Wai - congratulations on a top movie.",Chungking Express
9,The_Void,Shallow and hard to connect with. Nice camera work though,6,10 April 2005,"Chungking Express is a film that was nearly lost until Quentin Tarantino and his Rolling Thunder productions company brought it to the attention of the American mainstream...but seriously, he shouldn't have bothered. Wong Kar-Wai's film is an aesthetic treat - it looks nice, sounds nice, I dare say it would even smell nice if it had a scent - but plainly and simply, Chungking Express lacks substance and it's 2D characters and muddled (not to mention slow) plotting with only leave you cold by the time the final credits (finally) role. The colour scheme and way that the camera moves is bound to please fans of the technical side of cinema - and it is for those reasons why I hesitate to put this down as a bad film, it's just the story side that lets it down. The film follows two separate stories, both about heartbroken policemen. They've both lost their loves and found new ones, and the film follows them through their tribulations. This wouldn't be so bad, if Wong Kar-Wai gave you any reason at all to care for them. The characters shown in this film have been given two of the most wooden profiles ever to befall a film character and although it's obvious which side of the film is most important to Kar-Wai; at the end of the day, if a film like this fails to impact you on an emotional level - it has failed.I thought that there would be some sort of limit for how many times a song could be played in a movie, but Wong Kar-Wai obviously disagrees with that notion. The first time that The Mamas and the Papas' ""California Dreaming"" lit up the screen, I was pleased. It's a very nice song...but after the twentieth time of hearing it, I thought that a change of track was due. The film only has three popular tracks in it, and all of them are overplayed. I've never liked Daniah Washinton's ""What a Difference a Day Makes"", so hearing that didn't float my boat...but a Cantonese version of The Cranberries ""Dreams"" was a nice inclusion - but again, it's overplayed. That's the thing about this film, what it really lacks is ideas. We see characters talking to inanimate objects and dancing to California Dreaming and then, instead of seeing something else - we see the same thing again and again and again and it all gets very tiresome. Basically, this film is rated highly for two reasons: Quentin Tarantino has a lot of fans (even though this movie has nothing to do with him really) and the fact that everything from Asia is at the height of fashion right now. This film is worth seeing if you like to see well photographed movies with nice camera-work; but it's an ultimately shallow experience, and people that like their movies with a bit of meat on them will be thoroughly disappointed.",Chungking Express
10,DKosty123,Surprised By This One for A Couple of Reasons,8,20 June 2017,"Writer / Director Kar-Wai Wong's Chungking Express is surprising on many levels. While this is a simple Bachelors looking for love story at the outset Tony Chiu-Wai Leung (Cop 663) and Takeshi Kaneshiro(He Zhiwu, Cop 223). The females -Faye Wong (Faye), Brigitte Lin Woman in blonde wig (as Ching-hsia Lin), and Valerie Chow (Air Hostess) are all interesting company. The story weaves through the Chungking Express restaurant. The strange thing is the using of the Mamas & Papas California Dreaming as a theme relating to all these relationships.4 Years before The Blair Witch Project, this movie employs the same filming technique. The other surprise to me was the visuals Director Wong used in this movie. There are amazing visuals that are even more advanced than Blair Witch would be 5 years later. The way the director does chase scenes, jogging scenes, and uses mirrors and unique camera angles in this film make it a unique visual experience.Visually, this might be the most under appreciated film around. There are visuals here that would still be miles ahead of the CGI stuff that are now nowhere near this level. Between the outstanding visuals and a fine acting job by the cast, and a better than the average film by a mile.There are comedy elements which can make the viewer smile, though I have to admit I cringed when one actor ate 30 cans of sliced pineapple in one sitting. While I like Pineapple, for me this is a bit extreme sacrifice to make because your love has gone. I understand the Driector had 2 other projects going around the same time as this film. Still, the script is a different sort of romance and the visuals he employs in the film are simply amazing. Filmed on location in Hong Kong, and look for the American Corporate Logos in this film.",Chungking Express
11,dromasca,2 cops in love,7,15 August 2019,"Hong Kong is the news these days, and that was another reason to be very curious to see 'Chungking Express', a film made in 1994, a few years before the start of the process in which Hong Kong will return - in half a century - to be an integral part of China. Director Kar-Wai Wong enjoys considerable prestige, and this film in particular has one of the highest ratings. However, the viewing experience has only partially met expectations. 'Chungking Express' turned out to be a special film, with many interesting film-making details, but it did not manage to resonate for me neither by story, nor by the way in which its heroes act on screen.The intention of the director Kar-Wai Wong was likely to present one of the categories of characters that had made Hong Kong films famous at that time - the cops - in a completely different light. Instead of fighting with gangsters in gunshots duels or sophisticated martial arts choreographies, the two cops from the two successive stories from which the film is built are ... in love. There are some violent scenes in the first story, but the one involved is not the policeman but rather the woman he falls in love and near whom he will spend the night, without knowing that she is involved in drug trafficking and homicides. The two successive stories have nothing to do with each other but one single transitional scene, and the fact that the two cops in the two stories are each struggling with loneliness, they go through not-too-happy love stories, and they eat at the same small fast-food restaurant that is the crossroad of the events in the movie.The most beautiful and interesting part of the film is related to the cinematographic means. Director Kar-Wai Wong is a master of film shots at different speeds, combined at editing so that the viewers' attention is directed to the experiences of the characters on the screen. Filming took place in downtown Hong Kong, I visited the city several times and recognized some of the places, with narrow streets, markets and restaurants, slopes and escalators, artificial lights and noises that create the unique atmosphere of this metropolis. The main actors are excellently chosen and live rather than they act their roles, even when they are put in less natural situations, at least for my eyes af an European spectator. The music and soundtrack are also excellent and contribute to the stylistic unity of the film. The only essential thing I lacked was emotion. What constitutes the main quality of the film is also at the end of the day the difference that separates this good and interesting film from the level of a masterpiece. Excited by his own professional skills, director Kar-Wai Wong seems to forget at one point to leave enough room for genuine emotion. Although it tells two separate stories, each of them has time to become repetitive and difficult to follow in the multitude of cinematic details. While watching 'Chungking Express' I experienced a sensation that I sometimes have when visiting a richly ornate Baroque church. The richness and quantity of the details, each one admirable, makes me forget what is the purpose, the main thread of emotion and beauty of the whole construction.",Chungking Express
12,tomgillespie2002,Stunning exploration of love,10,26 April 2011,"As He Qiwu (Takeshi Kaneshiro) jogs around a deserted sports field in the pouring rain, he narrates 'we're all unlucky in love sometimes. When I am, I go jogging. The body loses water when you jog, so you have none left for tears'. For me, that quote summed up this quite wonderful movie. In any other film, the line would be so appallingly pretentious. Here, it fits the movies styles and attitudes. This is a playful, sensitive and almost mocking love-letter to the complications and folly of, well, love.The film tells two stories, one focusing on He Qiwu, also known as Cop 223, who, having recently broken up with his long-term girlfriend on April Fools Day, decides to buy a tin of pineapples with the expiration date of May 1st (his birthday) every day until May 1st. He feels this is the date to move on if they haven't gotten back together. Meanwhile, lonely and drunk, he spies a mysterious woman in sunglasses (Brigitte Lin) sat alone at a bar, who has just seen her drug smuggling operation go drastically wrong. In the second seemingly unconnected story, a quirky snack bar waitress Faye (Faye Wong) falls in love with Cop 633 (Tony Leung) who has also recently broke up with his air stewardess girlfriend. Faye, spotting his obvious loneliness, takes it upon herself to rearrange his apartment every time he is out to try and improve his outlook.Director Wong Kar-Wai made the film whilst on a break from editing his messy but still rather excellent film Ashes Of Time, wanting to make something light and down to earth in the wake of all the martial arts and visual poetry that went on in Ashes. To think he made this as a side project to calm his nerves speaks volumes about the Hong Kong directors' abilities. Originally seen as three stories, as opposed to two, the director had to cut out the third story feeling the film was too long, eventually making it into a full feature on its own, 1995's Fallen Angels. Although the two stories are seemingly unconnected, they are ultimately the same story told in slightly different ways, and both contain the same themes.It appeared to me at first that Chungking Express was ultimately about loneliness and longing. But in the couple days following, it came to me that perhaps it was actually about love. All the characters are lonely, disconnected and sad, and are all like this as a result of love. Love makes you do strange and bizarre things. He Qiwu, after building up a large collection of pineapple tins as May 1st hits, he decides to eat them all in one sitting. The strange and enchanting Faye, buys the oblivious Cop 633 fish and buys new furniture for his apartment, without him even noticing. He is so caught up in his lovesick rut that he almost believes the changes happening in front of him are a result of it.If the wonderful script and acting aren't enough, Kar-Wai films it all like a giddy schoolboy given a new camera for Christmas. It's the only film post-1960's I have seen that truly embodies the spirit of the French New Wave. Many have attempted mirroring the style, but Chungking Express has a restless and almost excitable style that boils over with fresh ideas.A bold and inspired film, full of intelligent writing, astonishing acting, and a beautiful setting in Hong Kong. And one that tackles the true complexities of love.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Chungking Express
13,howard.schumann,"Full of style, substance, and self-reflective humor",10,14 February 2005,"Hong Kong director Wong Kar-Wai's Chungking Express is a breathless tour de force that will leave you feeling exhilarated. Shot in the Kwaloon section of Hong Kong with a hand-held camera using impressionistic images, jump cuts, and stop-action camera-work, Wong vividly captures the kinetic energy of the city - its people, music, fast food cafés, and nightlife. Chungking Express is a quirky romantic comedy about chance encounters, lost opportunities, and the loneliness of city life where people never seem to communicate with each other directly. The film consists of two loosely connected stories involving different cops who have just broken up with their girlfriends. In the first sequence, most of the action takes place at a fast food stand called Chungking Express and little police-related activity is shown except for some choreographed shootouts.He Zhiwu, Cop 223 (Takeshi Kaneshiro) tells himself at the beginning of April that he will wait thirty days for his girlfriend May to come back to him before seeking another relationship. In mourning, he eats only from cans that have an expiration date of May 1st, his birthday. On May 1st, he eats thirty cans of pineapple (her favorite food) and jogs so ""there will be no water left for tears"" but it doesn't bring May back. His only connection is with a sturdy blonde played by veteran actress Brigitte Lin wearing a platinum blond wig. Unknown to him, she is a heroin smuggler on the run after a failed drug deal. They meet and go to his apartment but she simply passes out and he decides to move on. In the second episode, another lovelorn cop known only as Cop 633 (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) is in love with a stewardess and buys her a Chefs Salad from the same food stand every day.When she dumps him after he brings her fish and chips, he becomes interested in Faye (Faye Wong), an endearingly goofy counter girl who works for her cousin at the same snack bar. Faye develops a crush on him and sneaks into his apartment when he's not there, rearranging his furniture, removing traces of his old girlfriend, decorating and cleaning while dancing around the house to the music of the Mamas and the Papas. Their relationship has a playful quality to it though they both maintain their distance. After she reappears after having been away for one year, she asks him where he wants to go and he replies ""Wherever you want to take me"". Chungking Express will take you wherever you want to go and it is a giddy ride -- full of style, substance, and self-reflective humor. In the hands of Wong Kar-Wai, alienation never seemed as much fun.",Chungking Express
14,drqshadow-reviews,The Answers to Mundane Everyday Repetition are Everywhere,7,3 February 2012,"Lost love in the Hong Kong shuffle from four different, very mildly intertwining, perspectives. Moving at the irregular pace of life, its intentionally uneven gait is mesmerizing at times, slow and repetitive at others. Though the four alternating leads aren't the most varied bunch in cinema history, (the two men are overly self-absorbed and detached, while the corresponding ladies share a propensity to crazed social disorders) the inward-staring confessional nature of the story itself gives them each a special chance to shine as unique, relatable characters. There's a certain degree of the audience in each of them, and that makes each story tough to turn away from, even on the occasions when the plot has slowed to a walk. Though occasionally a bit over-ambitious in the wide variety of different shooting techniques it employs, the film is beautifully composed if somewhat firmly planted in the early '90s. Unspectacular at a glance, it's also strangely hypnotic and potently personal.",Chungking Express

19,sharky_55,Good thing she wasn't into durian.,8,15 February 2016,"One centimetre separates the two stories of Chungking Express. Two cops drift in the aftermath of the breakdown of long term relationships. Cop 223 wanders and buys cans of pineapples, hoping that their expiry dates are just false promises and that he will be given a second chance. Cop 663 stops by the Midnight Express food stall each night on his shift, but cannot seem to move on from his stewardess ex-girlfriend. This is the night-life of Hong Kong at its most vivid, taking its cues from the French New Wave; the hand-held camera barrels around cramped alleyways and corners bursting with the hum drum of the makeshift shops, neon signage and lights are deliberately overexposed, and each setting carries its own colour coding. The streets are cool blue, crowded yet lonely. Cop 223's apartment is sterile and bathed in green; he's one of those people that get super tidy after a breakup, instead of the opposite. The bar has an orange-red glow where he negotiates a lonely encounter with our other primary character, a drug dealer with a blonde wig, coat and sunglasses. There is also the step-printing effect that this movie is famous for - replicating frames which creates the staggering, blurry effect that would normally be associated with a drop in frame rate and shutter speed. This ups the kinetic chase scenes to almost sensory overload; the dim hallways, the multicoloured lights streaking all along the streets, car horns blaring from all directions. Wong Kar Wai isolates these characters within a paradox; they wander the streets of Hong Kong, one of the most densely populated cities in the world, but find themselves to be lonely at the end of each night. More than once, we find ourselves staring at Faye compartmentalised and squished between the shelves in the frame, with a sort of voyeuristic longing behind the gaze. Doyle and co. will use strong telephoto lenses to enhance this theme; one choice scene involves Leung beckoning her to lean in before whispering a joke. While they may be mere centimetres from one another, the focus instead has his face crisp and in the foreground while hers is further away and blurred. There is no better way to express 'close yet so far away'. The most iconic technique is the way WKW freezes our primary characters in these little moments while the rest of the Hong Kong crowd bustles and rushes past them. It's a breathtaking effect that locks them down within their own small pocket of eternity. The first instance is the most striking scene in the film; the big doe eyes of Faye staring across at Leung as he seeks to indefinitely delay the bad news and finality of what lies inside the envelope. Later this feeling is visualised the same way again, as he waits for a date that will never show, distracting himself by pushing coins into a jukebox. These seconds drag on agonisingly while the city rushes on, careless of their little crisis. Some detractors have complained about the repetition of the soundtrack and how it drones on and on. I think this marks, to some extent, the difference of attitudes and contexts of the western and eastern viewer. We are blessed to have musical and media overload, to have chart-topping hits at the touch of a button and more musical range than we could ever consume. For the Hong Kong of Chungking Express, pop songs leak through, and those that do, are treasured dearly. See how the camera sways in motion to a working Faye as she dances to California Dreaming for the umpteenth time. For her, it represents not literal California (although she does visit, and it isn't up to the fantasy), but the desire to escape the rat race of Hong Kong and travel. For Cop 663, it is that hazy, dreamlike apartment that she shared with his ex which contained all his love and comfort. As the cinematography overexposes the light coming in through the windows in those nostalgic rooms, it links itself to the reconciliation scene in the convenience store where the lights blare just as brightly and he finally finds his closure. Time for a new 'California'.",Chungking Express
20,aciessi,"A Good, Broken Record",6,9 April 2017,"This little film by Wong Kar-Wai has made some kind of movement in the states, but only when Quentin Tarantino, straight off of the success of Pulp Fiction, decided to catalog it in a selection of international deep cuts known as ""Rolling Thunder pictures"". He introduced to us a very simple- minded, un-pretentious, giddy Hong Kong film about love. There's a lot of funny little things here, having to do with canned goods. Also, this film arguably holds the record for the most times California Dreamin' by the Mamas and the Papas is played in a motion picture. It was played so much, that I now hate it. But in retrospect, it added to the gentle, playful nature of the film.",Chungking Express
21,khanbaliq2,Chungking Express was a revelation to both domestic and international audiences.,10,27 March 2010,"Chungking Express is what Jean-Luc Godard's movies were once like: fast, hand-held and very, very catchy. The story is about a lovelorn cop (Takeshi Kaneshiro) who unknowingly enters into a relationship with a heroin smuggler (Brigitte Lin), another officer (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) attempts to get over his failed liaison with an air stewardess.Consider the film Love In The Time Of Convenience Food: a swoony, neon-lit, ultra-modern fable of young romantic obsessives taking what they can get from life and pining when it falls short of expectations. There's perhaps less to it than ravishes the eye, but it's mostly irresistible, the film equivalent of a perfect bubblegum pop record.",Chungking Express
22,witster18,"Stylish, Energetic, Heartbreaking and Hopeful",10,5 September 2012,"This movie will not appeal to everyone.This is two stories in one. I've heard a lot of people saying the second half was better, but I thought both parts were equally effective.""Chungking Express"" was basically filmed while Wong Kar Wai was on hiatus from the ""Ashes of Time"" project. It's obvious this film provided the director with an escape, or a freedom of expression that the audience feels from the opening credits until the end of the film.While the story may feel disjointed - the style is extremely consistent and the pacing and music in the film really balance so nicely here.I had enjoyed the two films I had seen from this director,""happy together"" and ""Fallen Angels"", but I absolutely loved this one.There is something very real about this dreamlike world that the director has created here. The acting and writing are sharp, but it is the overall mood/feel of this film that really makes it stand apart.Won Kar Wai throws in some parallel characters that resemble the leads, and he also jumps time within the main characters lives. Both of these aspects add a little more intrigue to the story.This is a film that definitely needs repeat viewings to capture all the little nuances.Proof that when a talented director just throws something together it can be more powerful than an epic that takes years to make.Could have used a little less of the Chinese version of the Cranberries tune. That's my only gripe. This film has a few scenes that rank right up there with some of the fondest film memories that I have. This is a GREAT movie.Very unique, stylish effort. 93/100",Chungking Express
23,AhmedSpielberg99,Feast of the Senses!,9,18 October 2018,"I never thought that a movie that explores loneliness would end up being one of the most charming feel-good movies I've ever seen!

24,Maniac-9,Very fascinating movie,9,10 February 2012,"Movie is part fantasy/part reality and you have to determine what's real and what's not. Movie is set in mainland China, the movie is the story of human loneliness and despair from several different perspectives. The movie is a light hearted look at relationships. The song California Dreaming is used very well as the theme to the movie.The movie has a stellar cast with Tony Leung, Takeshi Kaneshiro, Brigette Lin and Faye Wong. Tony Leung is basically the equivalent of a younger Robert DeNiro for Hong Kong/Chinese cinema.Wong Kar Wai's vision of the film is truly mesmerizing and he's truly the most dynamic director from Asia.",Chungking Express
25,dr_foreman,Love through the filter of the movies,6,21 August 2006,"(beware: some spoilers follow) ""Chungking Express"" is all about love, apparently, but I don't think it can rightfully be called a romantic movie. The characters are all so obsessive, neurotic and downright oddball that the film makes love seem more like a bizarre illness than something to be cherished.The narrative is awkwardly split into two distinct stories, both involving mopey guys who are mooning over girlfriends they've lost. The two guys are pretty similar - they're both nice, passive, quirky, and cops - so I wonder why the film-makers felt the need to tell two separate stories in the first place. Why not flesh out one or the other more thoroughly? Or do a proper anthology with lots of ""shorts"" about love?Despite their weirdness, the characters are endearing, but their behavior often veers away from realism and into the realm of what I call ""movie-land."" It seems implausible, for example, that a woman would fall in love with a complete stranger, and then decide to gradually clean and refurbish his apartment, when he's not home and without his knowledge, over the course of several weeks. That kind of behavior is sort of insane, isn't it? In real life, it'd get you arrested. It stretches credibility even further that it appears to take this guy forever to notice the changes to his surroundings, and when he finally does notice, he discusses the matter with a bar of soap. That's what I mean by ""movie-land."" Compounding my irritation, the characters sometimes decide to wax poetic about their personal philosophies, in that mock-deep movie way, saying things like ""people remind me of expired cans of pineapples"" or some such rubbish. Is this really deep, or is it just like that old Saturday Night Live sketch, ""Deep Thoughts by Jack Handy""? Thankfully, ""Chungking Express"" is somewhat elevated by interesting shots of Hong Kong and energetic (but occasionally tiresome) hand-held camera work. The narrative has a disjointed feeling that is both a plus (it forces you to watch events closely, which is good) and a minus (because sometimes it's too confusing). In the first story, for example, I quickly lost track of exactly what on earth the woman in the blonde wig was up to, and who she happened to be shooting at each particular moment.It sounds like I really hated this movie, but I didn't. I just think it fits into that category of art-house movies that really aren't so great. I applaud it for being experimental and daring, but I don't think it really sheds a lot of light on the human condition. It's too slick and self-consciously over-the-top to achieve that particular goal.",Chungking Express
26,MikeyB1793,Existential Nowhere,3,9 October 2009,"I like a movie that has at least a vestige of a story. This doesn't occur in this movie. It's a series of vignettes with no cohesion.There are scenes of a person collecting pineapple cans. A woman with a blond wig never removes her sun glasses. This woman shoots at other people at the beginning of the movie and we never find out why. She disappears completely after about 30 minutes. There is another coquettish woman who endlessly cleans a man's apartment. There are endless scenes at a fast food joint where the Mamas & Papas 'California Dreaming' is vastly overplayed (I used to like the song). The dialogue is mostly concerned with food (pineapples, chef's salad and ordering drinks). I assume most of the actors gained weight during this movie because a lot of fast food was consumed.There is no passion in this movie because there is no story. This is purportedly a romance - it is no such thing. I just wonder why I didn't hit the Fast-forward. I kept waiting for something significant to happen – it doesn't. Maybe that's the only consolation to this movie - scenes shifted so rapidly that it tricked you into assuming that there was going to be a revelation to all the nonsense.",Chungking Express
27,loganx-2,It Can Be Nice Not Knowing How To Feel,7,30 July 2008,"Great writing, jarring and at times inspired camera work and editing. Great soundtrack. Stories of love, loneliness, and interconnection, simple when taken on their own, and more complex when taken as whole.At least from what I've seen of War Kong Wai' films they defy easy categorization, they are effective and genuine, but also elliptical and odd. I enjoyed it emotionally, and ended scratching my head, but that wasn't a bad thing, was Chunking Express a reference to the drug trade or the restaurant around which everything revolved, whose the blonde in the wig?, but then ""The Cranberries"" ""Only In Dreams"" get's played in Japanese who cares, why can't their be Amelieesque pixie like women with cropped haircuts, who magically re-arrange your house when your not around? Where everyone uses Richard Brautigan like personifications to describe all of the objects of isolation? Well I don't mind, anyway.1 story a man falls in love with a woman who doesn't love him, and who he only knows for a few hours, the 2nd story is of two people who obviously desire each other, but opt for cat and mouse, for years as opposed to making a move.

28,socrates4,Great Movie,10,26 January 2019,"I saw this film on the Rolling Thunder Pictures DVD, Quentin Tarantino's former company that put out foreign films and art films on home video in the United States. Of all the titles that the company released in the short while it was around, this one was the best and really turned me on to this great filmmaker, Wong Kar-Wai, who has made many great films.CHUNGKING EXPRESS is a fun story that is just so enjoyable to watch. The narration the camerawork are beautiful, and is the wonderful soundtrack. It is one of my favorite films. Highly recommend.",Chungking Express
29,TaylorYee94,Innovative cinematography but where is the story?,5,17 September 2020,"Personally, the movie's backbone should be the storyline. Cinematography, mise-en-scene, lighting, angles, sound & music, and acting are means for a director to convey the story and the message most clearly and effectively and to enhance the feelings and emotions for audience.After I watch this movie, I thought 'what a waste of talent for Wang Kar Wai'. Dynamic camera movement, colors of the movie, mise-en-scene, and the setting are the work of art, but all I get out of this movie is just that. Technique score 9, but there was no story, and I did not 'feel' anything after the movie.",Chungking Express
30,gsygsy,Two halves,4,29 January 2014,"The first half of this movie is excellent. It is carried by two charismatic stars - Brigitte Lin, Takeshi Kaneshiro - who act very well. It's a fun mix of detective story and wry romance. The second half is a whole other movie, thematically linked only by the most tenuous of threads, featuring the great Tony Leung, but ultimately dependent on the narrower talents of pop star Faye Wong. Her gifts are stretched very thinly indeed by the large amount of screen time she's given. I'm sorry to say I was so bored after twenty minutes of her whimsy that I started to doze.Wong Kar-Wai makes visually stylish movies. From what I've read about them, their peculiar energy seems partly to stem from scenes and story-lines being cobbled together at the last minute. It's a risky strategy, but clearly it can succeed. Sometimes, as in HAPPY TOGETHER, this improvisatory approach can sustain a whole picture. CHUNGKING EXPRESS is only a half-full glass. It's the second half that's empty.",Chungking Express
31,Pro Jury,A near miss,4,20 April 2001,"A never ending frenzy of clever visual ironies does not necessarily create an engaging film. The ""Blonde Wig"" half of the movie never took off perhaps due to too much self-indulgence by its makers.                              The Wong Faye half (featuring a very playful, if Karen Carpenter looking, Faye Wong) holds much more appeal. All the ingredients are there, however, the girl-meets-boy story element takes a back seat to artsy cleverness. Character development is uneven. Emotion is missing.                              For music lovers, Wong Faye's ""Mung Jung Yun"" (Cantonese version of the Cranberry's smash hit ""Dreams"") is used effectively in Chungking Express.  Faye Wong also recorded a Mandarin language version called ""Zhen Tuo."" Both are on CD, although only ""Mung Jung Yun"" is found on the official movie soundtrack CD.",Chungking Express
32,charchuk,"Colourful, expressive, powerful.",10,30 March 2008,"I found it extraordinarily powerful and nearly emotionally overwhelming. The use of colour, slow-motion, fast-motion, music, and several visual motifs makes for a truly sensual experience. This is not a film of narrative continuity, character development, or psychological motivations (though it's certainly not lacking in the latter two). This is a film based entirely around the notion of being a film, and everything that comes with that. It's not an animated storybook. It's not a visual novel. This is a movie. Every shot is expertly crafted, every cut timed specifically, every moment utilized perfectly to maximize effect. Only one film in, and Wong Kar-wai is already one of my favourite directors. This is a masterpiece.",Chungking Express
33,InzyWimzy,Super Goodfeel,10,18 December 2003,"Stunned.  Chungking Express should be seen at least once for the experience. Caution: may cause smiling and frequent laughter.What a contrast to Fallen Angels which was the first Wong Kar Wai film  I've seen.  Talk about polar opposites.  The characters here are your everyday working people living ordinary lives.  I love the idea of the people we walk and pass by everyday.  Who knows what a random meeting will lead to?  The chemistry between the actors is key.  Takeshi Kaneshiro (I never thought of jogging that way) and Tony Leung are both great as two fellows going through a down of sorts.  No one wants to be alone. Or have you ever thought to yourself and asked, ""What do I want in life?  Where do I want to go?""  If anyone can relate to that, Wong Kar Wai captures that in his film.   
Also, I love the contrast between the leading ladies; Brigitte is mysterious as the enigmatic blone and she still shines through.  On the other hand, Faye's charismatic, bouncy personality is so infectious and definitely made her my favorite.  It all comes out through her facial expressions, her dancing, her bright eyed look and super smile is awesome!  My mindset is fixed with that song by the Mama and the Papas and Faye.  That and her Cranberries' tribute.  When she and Tony  are onscreen together, it's magic. My favorite thing about Tony is for all the different roles he's played, he always comes off as himself.  I'm sure the ladies love his scenes in the apartment!I wouldn't consider this a great Hong Kong movie.  This is a great film PERIOD.  Chungking Express has replay value and there's so much more to love and appreciate upon later viewings.  Definitely see it for Faye!",Chungking Express

35,B24,Cinematic Calligraphy,3,20 September 2003,"Average viewers looking for any sense of internal coherence in a film should probably give this one a pass.  It generates the same feeling as staring at a curious array of individual images that seem to have some relationship one to another, but never coalesce into a totality.While this isolative approach to creating a kind of cinematic montage may appeal to a few students or critics steeped in the inside language of contemporary filmmaking, it is flatly irritating and condescending to us commoners who just fell off the haywagon.  An overt avoidance of accessibility may be the intentional hallmark of auteurs like Kar-wai Wong and Tarantino, but to me it comes across as Andy Warhol warmed over. The only redeeming characteristic I find is in the production values, and them there just ain't going to cut it all by themselfs.This is one of those productions in which you watch and listen and wait anxiously and in vain for some clever development of an idea or thought to sustain all the remarkable and beautiful individual scenes.  Sorry.  The calligraphic credits unexpectedly begin to roll just as your interest begins to stir.  I get the same big yawn and let-down reading what I guess are very knowledgeable and thorough comments about this film that never lead to anything truly comprehensible.  Ideas and images without some external context are not my idea of fun.Call me a philistine roaming the streets of Hong Kong looking for a bowl of chop suey.",Chungking Express
36,refresh_daemon,It's effervescent! Great for those who love cinema,10,1 February 2007,"I finally got a chance to finish this movie and I have to say that I love it. It's a very expressionistic piece with a lot of attention to film details, such as editing, framing, camera-work, etc. that makes film geeks like me gush with enthusiasm. There's a buoyancy and an energy to almost every second of the film that makes the budget production quality seem like an enhancement rather than a problem--it's as though this film could only be made on a limited budget, using a hand-held camera, cheaper filmstock and so forth.First of all, this film is not about story or even characters in the traditional story sense, although there is a little character development, it's more about communicating the experience of the characters to the audience in a way that incorporates the entirety of the film. In that way, it reminds me of Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless. However, this film is a bit more centered on the characters' experience of getting over heartbreak and attempts to find new love amidst the heartbreak.The acting in the film is just fine, although I'd have to give the upper hand to the second half of the film's duo over the first. However, despite the solid acting overall, this film is really a director's film. Some of the tricks that director Wong Kar Wai pulls are just so perfect in capturing mood and emotion. The writing is a little unspectacular, but then again, the use of voice-over and the simplistic nature of the dialogue all help drive the experiential effect of the film.There are weaknesses in the film, like the story and the occasional moments where my suspension of disbelief is tested, but these are minor details, since the film's emotional and experiential power had me feeling quite effervescent at the end of the film. I loved it. 10/10.Now if we could only get Quentin Tarentino's name off the DVD cover and replace it with Wong Kar Wai...",Chungking Express

This film explores fleeting encounters, sometimes strange but with which we can easily identify.It's a journey through pain, the mourning of a relationship with an abrupt end and the acceptance of the inevitable and consequent moving forward.The photography doesn't disappoint, the color schemes and the shots composition are wonderful and addictive.As the soundtrack goes, the constant repetition of a certain music leads us almost automatically to associate feelings and sensations that we have already seen in the narrative, in a harmonious way through out the film.",Chungking Express
39,simon_booth,Perfect mix of pop and art,10,14 June 2003,"Wong Kar-Wai has a general disdain for plot that I find quite admirable. His films are all about characters. Chungking Express features a few main characters. Takeshi Kaneshiro can't get over losing his girlfriend so he buys pineapples. Brigitte Lin's drug deal goes sour so she is on the run. Leung Chiu-Wai can't deal with change, and also can't get over his girlfriend. Faye Wong... well, Faye Wong in Chungking Express just has to be seenChungking Express was made during a break from post-production on Ashes Of Time, as Wong Kar-Wai needed to distance himself from that troublesome project for a while to get his bearings and recharge his batteries. The result is the antithesis of the dark, brooding epic... a light, fluffy and upbeat little film that is like a little ode to Hong Kong's streets and people. It shares themes of loneliness and the difficulty of sharing the planet with other people, but seems a little more optimistic that the task isn't always doomed to futility.Chungking Express definitely feels like pop-cinema, but has more than enough artistic ambition in it too... a very different kind of art film from the slow & ponderous films that most people think of when the term is mentioned. It's full of life and energy, and undoubtedly one of the ""coolest"" films of the 90's.Much of the film's energy and style come from the visuals, where Wong Kar-Wai and Christopher Doyle seem determined to make every shot unique and beautiful. Some of the camera positions and movements are nothing short of genius. The camerawork is well complicated by innovative editing and an eclectic soundtrack. The film undoubtedly owes a lot to the more experimental film-making techniques that are usually found in music videos - or perhaps the film's style has just been a massive influence on half the music videos produced since (my chronology isn't too sharp when it comes to music videos I'm afraid). Whatever it's influences, the look of the film is totally unlike anything else from Hong Kong before it.Of all Wong Kar-Wai's films, CHUNGKING EXPRESS is probably the most readily accessable and the most commercial. Despite it's innovative and eliptical story-telling and its philosophical leanings, the film is so infectiously energetic that it's hard to imagine any audience not enjoying it. A lot of the credit for this has to go to Faye Wong, who just shines as the bouncy little imp in the second half of the film. I defy anyone not to fall in love with her after watching it.Chungking Express is surely one of the most imaginative, unique and influential films of the 1990's, and one of the most enjoyable. Its effect on the Hong Kong industry was palpable, and in some ways quite negative I think. Suddenly everybody had to worry about whether their films were *artistically* accomplished, as well as whether they were commercially attractive or not. I think this was a problem for a lot of HK film makers, who were left quite lost and unsure of themselves. Yes, I don't think the handover or the economy are the real reasons for the decline of Hong Kong Cinema since the late 90's... it's all Wong Kar-Wai's fault! Poor Tsui Hark has never been the same since Chungking & Ashes Of Time hit the theatres anyway.So, in conclusion, just in case there's anyone out there that hasn't seen Chungking Express yet.... shame on you! Go buy it right now!",Chungking Express
40,RockPortReview,Beautiful stories told in Busy and changing Hong Kong,8,12 November 2009,"Chunking Express 11/11/2009This amazing little piece of Hong Kong cinema, directed by Wong Kar-Wai, is a great example of a modern story told in modern times. This film effortlessly tells two different stories about four different characters, in a very fast, kinetic pace. This is the film Quentin Tarantino broke down in tears for. Not necessarily for its content but for his love of the movies creation as a whole. Both stories bring forth the themes of coincidence, chance meetings, breaking free of routines and overcoming heartbreak. This all taking place as China was about to retake over rule of Hong Kong in 1997.The first story involves Qiwu, a policeman who finds himself in a sort of personal and professional crisis. His girlfriend May has broke up with him and at one point he almost gives up on anybody calling him to work on case. Qiwu is a good man, but a lonely man who seems to find solace in food and jogging. He buys cans of pineapple that must have a May 1st expiration date. This is his birthday and also a self conceived deadline for May to reconcile with him. The story lines jump between this and one of a drug smuggling woman in a trench coat and sunglasses. She gathers together a bunch of Indian men in an attempt to smuggle a load of coke. These men have no respect or regard for the women who pays them upfront. The men eventually bolt and she is left searching for them. She eventually finds them in a hostel and shots them dead. After Qiwu eats 30 cans of pineapple (in one sitting) he ventures out to bar, and proceeds to puke his guts out. He is now free of the memory of his five year relationship with May and looks to move on. He starts to chat with the trench coat woman who pays no attention to him. They eventually share there sorrows and drink until bar closing. She eventually passes out in his apartment. Qiwu seems to be an insomniac as he watches two movies on T.V. while consuming four chef salads. The woman leaves without notice. She then leaves him a happy birthday message on his voice mail. Qiwu leaves us with the feeling that love is a can of pineapple that doesn't expire.We now go to a second story involving another cop known only as #663 (his badge number). He and Qiwu both frequent The Midnight Express, a local food fast food stand. #663 is often in his police uniform as Qiwu is always in plain clothes. A young free-spirited girl who is obsessed with the song ""California Dreaming"" starts working at the Express and has a crush on #663. After he has a fling with a flight attendant, #663 is once again lonely and talking to dish rags, stuffed animals and other inanimate objects. The flight attendant leaves him a letter and his apartment key at the Express, in which #663 refuses to pick up. The girl sees this as an opportunity to do some cheering up and possibly more. She sneaks into his apartment and does a little redecorating (and cleaning). She tries to shake things up for ole #663, to show him what he is missing in life. She is caught on a few occasions and is completely embarrassed. #663 has been ""sleepwalking"" through life and this girl is just the person to wake him up. In a twist, #663 finally asks her out, but she stands him up, and goes to California. She leaves him a self drawn boarding pass dated for 1 year later. After the year has passed she comes back to find that #663 has bought the Midnight Express and is renovating it. She is now a flight attendant and things have come full circle.",Chungking Express

42,netwallah,Two offbeat Hong Kong romances for the price of one,9,2 February 2006,"Two lovesick Hong-Kong copsthe first a handsome detective mooning over a break-up with a girl named May one month ago on his birthday, May 1, collecting pineapple tins with that expiry date, musing whether everything, including memory, has to have an expiry date attached, and running obsessively because that way the body is too dehydrated for tears. The first story is mysteriously mixed with an obscure noir subplot in which a mysterious woman with a blond wig and shades organizes a failed drug smuggling attempt and then must escape from some one. The second story involves handsome beat cop 633 (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) whose airline hostess girlfriend has just broken up with him, and who frequents a take-out shop ""Midnight Express"" where Faye (Faye Wong) works. She's the very fetching, eccentric niece of the jolly owner (Cheng Jingquan). She falls in love with him and sneaks into his apartment to rearrange things. When finally 633 recognizes her charm, she goes away, leaving a note, a ""boarding pass,"" dated a year henceand she returns after the year is over. There is some fine photography, hand-held jerky chase scenes in the first part, an eloquent long shot from the rain-soaked fence of the sports field, and the slow motion of 633 putting a coin in the jukebox while fast-motion people rocket blurrily past behind him. The music is great (especially Faye Wong making salads to the beat of ""California Dreaming"" and a Chinese version of a Cranberries song). It's good to see a movie take the notion of men suffering through break-ups seriously (and hilariously). Even though the first part seems needlessly obscure and incomplete, the movie as a whole is charming and happy-making",Chungking Express

Very funny. Cinematography is good. The metaphors are very deep with personal life of the cops. You very much connect with the stories a lot. This is its beauty. The background score is excellent.
Also how a place in a middle of nowhere can have very interesting and captivating stories.",Chungking Express
44,timmy_501,Isolated characters find connections,9,22 August 2010,"Here's a film that is much more about mood than plot. Wong Kar Wai's Chungking Express is made up of two distinct parts: the first is about a depressed police officer attempting to get over a break-up and find the courage to move on with his life and the second is about a different police officer that goes through life in a daze and his decision to start paying attention to his life.The depressed cop in the first section is isolated from everyone around him. There's a focus here on consumerism; for example our protagonist collects cans of fruit that will expire on his birthday and he's so fixated on this idea that he even assigns an expiration date on his feelings for his ex. It's easy to see how he got to this point, though, as he's surrounded by garish signs and product logos. Further, he seems to have little privacy as practically every scene in this section takes place in a public forum. The plot is pretty simple here but it's marvelously expressed as famed Wong collaborator Christopher Doyle's cinematography brings the character's solitary existence to life; the character's emotions resonate with the viewer.The detached police officer in the second section seems to prefer to be left alone; although he also goes through a break up he doesn't even care about his ex's attempts to communicate with him. In an almost surreal development, another woman develops an obsession with him and repeatedly breaks into his house and changes things around without ever attracting his notice. This man is at a different stage of solitude than the other; while the other man seeks companionship and fails to find it this man seeks to avoid companionship and finds it thrust upon him. While this character certainly seems to be further gone than his counterpart he ultimately goes through more of a change than the other man due to his positive experience with another person.While Chungking Express doesn't do much in terms of plot, it's full of interesting characters brought to life by the film's excellent cast. The music is also a real stand out in the second section particularly as the song ""California Dreaming"" comes to be symbolic of the characters' desire to try something different and gains resonance each of the several times it plays. The film is also full of phenomenal cinematography courtesy of one of the best director/cinematographer teams of the decade. All in all, Chungking Express is one of the best films of 1994.",Chungking Express
45,sharptongue,Most over-rated film in HK movie history,1,24 March 2000,"I am completely baffled as to why this film is even liked, let alone held in such high regard, especially by so many critics who are, otherwise, quite sensible.There is one key word which describes this film to its core - irritating.The most easily explained example of this is the director's use - or, more accurately, abuse - of music. In the first half, a really dull reggae tune is played about three times (when once is too often). But in the second half, The Mommas And The Papas ""California Dreamin'"" is played at least seven times, usually at top volume. Godsakes, whether you liked the song or not beforehand, you'd be thoroughly sick of it by the end. Just think, some people claim to have seen this film four or five times. This means they've listened to California Dreamin either 28 or 35 times.....All of this needless hyper-repetition (it contributes nothing to the story) could possibly be excused if the remainder of the film had any lingering merit, or if the story was in any way involving.But it ain't.The only aspect I found likeable was Bridgette Lin's charging around and still playing Asia The Invincible in a raincoat and sunnies. Even this wore off fairly quickly.I'm sure this film's undeserved high reputation will convince many poor suckers to go and see it.I can only warn you - if you've never seen a HK movie before, don't start with this one.If you feel compelled to watch it, avoid at all costs seeing it in a cinema. The fast-forward and mute buttons are essential tools for survival here.You have been warned !",Chungking Express
46,p_radulescu,The Right Word Would Be Mesmerizing,10,20 April 2010,"1994: work on Ashes of Time was extremely demanding, kind of never-ending doing and re-doing of scenes, on the verge of breakdown. A two-months hiatus appeared (they had to wait for some new equipment) and Wong Kar-Wai suddenly decided to make quickly a totally different movie, 'just to follow his instincts' (as he would say later in an interview). No screenplay, dialogs and situations were decided each day on the spot. The result was one of the most important movies of our time: Chungking Express, so innovative in the use of camera and soundtrack that it leaves you speechless. Cinematographer Chris Doyle simply revolutionized here the art of filming. The name of Jean-Luc Godard is always reminded when people talk about Chungking Express; I would say that this movie is as innovative as only Man with a Camera was.Is it possible for a cop to get in love? Of course it is, and when the cop is young it is even nice. Well, the movie comprises two unrelated stories, with young cops in love. Undercovered cop 223 was left by his girlfriend, and he falls for a mysterious woman with a blonde wig. It happens that she is a drug smuggler. Does it matter? As for the second half of the film, uniformed cop 633 was left by his girlfriend and now a girl working at Midnight Express falls for him. As I am a nice guy, I wouldn't deconspire more of the plot.The title comes from the name of two places in Hong Kong: Midnight Express is a fast-food in Lan Kwai Fong (kind of Hong Kong version of SoHo); Chungking Mansions (where most of the first half of the movie takes place) is a mall-cum-flophouse, noisy, dingy, down-market place incredibly located right in the midst of Tsim Sha Tsui, a very chic Hong Kong area. I hadn't (yet?) the opportunity to be there. but I was once at Chelsea Market in Manhattan and I thought immediately at the movie of Wong Kar-Wai.Don't look for a logic in this movie, because any logic would be fake; Wong doesn't try to arrange the moments in some succession, because each moment exists on its own, carries its own truth and doesn't care about the rest. Instead of a synthesis the movie offers non-related glimpses; instead of an ultimate truth it offers contradictory slices of truth. It's not life as we think it should be: it's life as it is.It's soaked in neon lights. It's fun, it's noisy, it's fast. And, above all, it's filled with incredible, hypnotic poetry.The right word for this movie would be mesmerizing. Enjoy!",Chungking Express

Even from a storytelling aspect, this movie offers something unique and something I personally love; the telling of two entirely unrelated stories but with one thematically seamless narration of love and heartbreak.It has been well over 24-hours since I watched this movie and I still keep thinking about it; about how a movie as simple as this could have such a lasting charm on its audience. It is a vibe of its own; a beautifully contagious one that comes from the unspoken expressiveness of love that the screen can't help contain.Everything about this movie is beautiful.

Although at first he did not give up, he still had to accept the ruthless fact. When he drank in the bar, he encountered a mysterious woman. He saw a new hope.Cop 633 was also discarded by his stewardess girlfriend. It looked like that he was not so painful as cop 223. He was attracted deeply by a frank waitress. Due to shyness, the waitress showed secretly her love to him.Love should be mutual or no good outcome. Unrequited love only makes agony. If two people had unspoken consensus, love will be unavoidable.By far I have watched all movies directed by Wong Kar-Wai, though I am not his fan. This movie is my favorite.

51,wickedmikehampton,Inventive for its era,6,16 December 2020,"Director Kar-Wai's biggest commercial success is the more recent 'Grandmaster' which tells the story of IP Man, the trainer of Bruce Lee (not to be confused with the IP Man series by others). It was decent, shot well and with great action scenes but, overall, never grabbed me.Better were the duet, 'In the Mood for Love' and '2046'. They were classy but required patience and a particular frame of mind. Although they were shots years apart, and have crossover characters, they were different because '2046' carried a sci-fi element that requires smarts to watch it.'2046' remains his best but 'Chungking Express' (1994) and 'Fallen Angels' (1995) are his early landmarks, gaining him recognition in the USA. However, what made me interested in them was an episode of the (much missed) Anthony Bourdain who spent an episode eating with the cinemaphotographer.'Chungking Express' opens with a short story about a dopey, lovesick guy before heading into an hour with a quirky girl at a food stall falling in love with a cop who buys food there. She then breaks into his apartment daily. I get why it's popular. Early movies were standardised, stereotypically dull or stereotypically elegant. 'Chungking' shook that up with unconventional camera work e.g. shaky, and blurry for motion scenes. The alternate music culture would have dug it.That movie only happened because the director had 2 months to spare whilst his big historical action drama was being edited. 'Chungking' was meant to be 3 stories but when it became too long, he put the last into 'Fallen Angels' the following year. The camera became grittier and close-up, semi-hourglass shots making it avant garde for its time. It was also different to have conventional conversation replaced by three inner dialogues of a hitman, an organiser of his targets, and an unrelated mute bum who rarely bump into each another.Of the two, 'Chungking' is more accessible, and fits best into 1994 which was possibly Generation X's best year (an era of Pearl Jam and Quintin Tarantino).",Chungking Express

53,Mobithailand,The cinematography is truly innovative and the performances by the ensemble cast of Hong Kong /Chinese actors is absolutely riveting.,9,3 May 2016,"I doubt whether many of you have heard of this film. It is a Hong Kong movie made by and starring Hong Kong Chinese, with English sub-titles. For any of you out there who are tired of the mainstream hogwash churned out by the major Hollywood studios, then I suggest you track down this movie. It will make a very pleasant, entertaining change to your regular movie diet.This film is, in fact, two separate stories about two Hong Kong cops back in the mid 90's who have both been ditched by their long term girlfriends. Doesn't sound like much in the way of story lines, but trust me, they are both fascinating contemporary dramas. The second story, in particular, is full of unpretentiousness, humour, warmth, with just a very small dose of pathos.The humour, in both stories, is so original and funny that it actually had me laughing out loud, and believe me, it takes something very funny for me to do that. (This is not slapstick humour – it is real humour.)The cinematography is truly innovative, and the performances by the ensemble cast of Hong Kong /Chinese actors is absolutely riveting.If you want to see parts of Hong Kong that you probably have never seen before; see how the working classes and the aspiring 'upwardly mobile' classes were living in the 1990's; watch a couple of charming, delightfully endearing and amusing stories without any of the tear- jerking, syrupy drivel that Hollywood rom-coms attempt to drag out of you, then you could do far, far worse than watch Chunking Express.According to IMDb, a dreadful piece of junk like ""Angels and Demons"" grossed 133 Millon dollars, but Chunking Express only grossed 650 thousand.That's sad, or maybe it's me that has bad taste.",Chungking Express
54,Mike Astill,A great little film,8,12 October 2001,"This film tells two stories, similar in their theme of loneliness, pain and fate.  The first I wasn't so keen on, although it's always a pleasure to watch Brigitte Lin, even if she spends every scene in sunglasses and blonde wig. The second, however, made me fall in love with this movie completely.A cop (Leung) pining after his lost love pours out his sorrows to a fast-food vendor, attracting the attention of the young woman who has just started working there (the gorgeous Faye Wong). Fascinated by the lonely cop, she takes to sneaking into his apartment to clean and tidy, feed his fish and even redecorate. Still moping, he suspects he's losing his mind as he notices the changes. The melancholy story, as simple as it is, is just so sweet you can't help being touched by it, and Wong Kar-wai's deft direction makes it seem very personal and human. It's not important that the conclusions to both stories are kind of ambiguous; films like this are rare and should be treasured.",Chungking Express
55,revere-7,This film IS Hong Kong,6,24 October 2009,"The 1990s will go down in history as being the decade of independent film. Filmmakers across the U.S. and around the world created a record number of celluloid stories, and two cable channels were launched to showcase this massive volume of work.And while most were, in retrospect, less than stellar, even the very average ones seemed great precisely because of their averageness. Ordinary stories about ordinary people, such a far cry from the decades old glamorous Hollywood formulas we'd all grown so tired of.Which brings us to 'Chungking Express'. Don't be fooled by the fact that this Hong Kong film about two cops was distributed in the U.S. by Quentin Tarantino; It's actually a very human story of love and loneliness in the big city. Though we've seen the same story before ('Breathless' for Paris) and since ('Lost in Translation' for Tokyo), this is Hong Kong's turn. And Hong Kong, is the real star of the film. Similar to the New York of a Paul Auster novel, this Hong Kong, from it's back alleys and tenements to it's street side markets and titular carryout business, sticks with you long after the details of the plot fade.A movie to be experienced.",Chungking Express

A great script, endearing characters, but the western viewer may be turned off by elements of violence occurring in an otherwise'cute film. This was a problem for me watching 'fallen angels' but here the violence is minimal and the rest of the film more than compensates.

59,markwood272,"On the way to seeing this movie 10,000 times",10,20 July 2012,"One obvious sign of liking a movie is watching it again and again. Some thoughts after a tenth time with ""Chungking Express"": 1. The movie and my viewing of it make up a set of harmonious coincidences. First: According to what I have read, it was conceived and completed quickly when the director hit a two-month hiatus in the midst of another project. Second: The movie treats the way chance encounters sometimes turn into things of great consequence. Third: I saw the movie on a hot summer afternoon in 1996, also very much by chance when, while walking home from work, I suddenly wanted to spend a couple of hours in an air conditioned theater. ""Chungking Express"" just happened to be the first movie I found. I knew nothing about it before watching it. Fourth: And after seeing it and liking it very much, I pretty much forgot about it until seeing the Criterion DVD in 2011 – fifteen (15) years later. This belated second viewing was the one that cast a spell. And it has become stronger with every repeat viewing. Maybe this ever growing affection for the movie parallels the developing relationship between the characters. 2. Another comment on repeat viewings: I had never heard of any of the cast or crew of this movie before I saw it. I think I experienced the first viewing without having to filter my impressions through the lens of the celebrity and stardom of the performers. Instead the people in the movie – at least the non-criminal ones – are people I have come to like very much, almost as friends. A strange effect, hard to describe. It may account for the many viewings, which are almost like visiting people I simply enjoy being with. I'd be interested to find out if I'm the only one who has had this reaction.3. A date movie, yes, but a paradoxical one. Even though when I first saw this movie I was dating two women and recall taking one of them to another certifiable ""date movie"" during this period, I have never seen ""Chungking Express"" with anyone but myself. Maybe this is a good movie for people about to go on a date to see separately before going out, making this sort of a ""pre-date"" movie. The cross currents of rejection and breaking up, with a cast of endearing solipsists searching for companionship and falling in love, albeit one-sidedly and with aching tentativeness, make this the only ""date movie"" I know of that can work its magic (for me, anyway) when enjoyed alone. 4. Eighteen years after its initial release the movie does not look terribly dated. Although at the time of release the impending reversion of Hong Kong to mainland control was three years away, the characters do not explicitly mention the subject. The prospective change of government, something ""there"" obliquely for my first viewing in 1996, seems to have disappeared as a significant aspect of the movie. The only obvious set of time markers is the use of pay telephones, answering services, and pagers. This retro ingredient is more than balanced by a prophetic use of abrupt, swooping, convulsive camera movements and step printing: although rooted in the world of MTV, the look of the film anticipates cell phone and You Tube video.5. The film offers a look at some of the things going on in the world of motion pictures in the early to mid-90's: international interest in Hong Kong cinema and Asian cinema generally; the influence of MTV-inspired film technique; a spike in the perennial popularity of romantic comedies; audience acceptance of combined stories with fragmented, braided narrative lines (""Chungking Express"" was released at about the same time as ""Pulp Fiction"".) 6. In my nearly six decades of watching movies I can't remember any of them achieving in 90 minutes or more the truth and emotional power that ""Chungking Express"" manages to pack into its final 15 seconds.",Chungking Express
60,pickle-92642,Interesting introduction to Wong Kar-wai!,8,24 July 2021,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this a lot. It's a very interesting story about 2 depressed cops that each fall in love with these unique women. It was told in such a strange yet captivating way; The first half of the film was of one cop, and the second half was of another. I'm not gonna lie though, I liked the style of the first half a lot better than the second. I was really hoping for a good ending to tie everything together, like a twist or something linking the two stories together. But no, it just... ended. No real closure for me. The characters in the first half were also much more interesting, my favorite character of the whole movie was easily Cop 223. A close second is the wigged woman. The only real main problem I had with this was that it felt like nothing I was watching had a point to it. I didn't really care for a lot of the stuff that happened, it seemed like a random double feature love story. Also, before this movie I checked the genres, and noticed it was categorized as a COMEDY. I distinctly remember not laughing one single time. Idk if there's a cultural difference between Hong Kong comedy and English comedy, but this was not funny. However, I really liked the style and cinematography of this film. A lot of bonus points for that. The soundtrack was great, the performances were great, the basic factors you need to make a good film were all present, it was a good movie. I've seen much better, but this was good. I definitely recommend and can't wait to watch more Wong Kar-Wai.",Chungking Express
61,faterson,"Boring Hodgepodge, or: You Get What You Put In",1,14 February 2019,"""You get what you pay for"", right? Perhaps not every single time; there may be exceptions, but that's the overwhelming tendency.As I was suffering through the ordeal of watching _Chungking Express_ (checking the timeline every few minutes, counting down the minutes remaining, because I just couldn't wait for the movie to be over at very long last), I was reminded of the saying above.Transferred to the world of art: you're unlikely to create a masterpiece of art if you, as the creator, put little ""standard"" effort in its creation. Masterpieces of art typically require *monumental* effort on the part of their creators - standard effort may not be enough, let alone *sub-par* effort. Professional movie critics - and fans of this movie, too (who include luminaries such as Quentin Tarantino) - would have us believe that _Chungking Express_ is a masterpiece, despite its having originated pretty much as an afterthought, or perhaps because the director was contractually obligated to deliver *some* movie to his production company; never mind its content or quality.So, after I finished watching the movie, frustrated like hell (how could a movie celebrated like this turn out to be so unbearable?!), I proceeded to read about its background...... and I experienced several ""Aha!"" moments. The biggest of them was: the director Wong Kar-wai apparently launched into filming this movie without even having completed its screenplay! He continued writing the screenplay on every day the movie was being made. He said, proudly, I think (paraphrasing him), ""In the morning of another shooting day, I had no idea how the story would develop over the course of that day; we would just continue 'making up the story' as we went along.""Oh, my god... but it shows, let me tell you! There is zero coherence in this movie. Movie critics and fans would have us believe that this fatal flaw was, in fact, its intended virtue. First, given the chaotic origin of the movie (sincerely admitted by the director), I doubt that it was so.But whether intended or not, the movie lacks coherence to a degree that made it unpalatable for me. And it wasn't about lack of coherence, only: I thought the characters in the movie lacked any sort of attraction (apart from their physical traits); watching these two couples, two men and two women, ""fall in love"" (if you can call the sort of obsessed sex craze depicted in the movie ""love"") was excruciatingly boring. The dialogs were trite in the extreme; ""profound"" like a muddy pool of rain water. How many times do we need to witness the first main male character vainly trying to reach some high-school sweetheart of his on the phone? (Never mind he did so in various East Asian languages; hats off to every polyglott!)And, oh, if you thought that ""California Dreamin'"" by The Mamas and The Papas was a nice classic tune, watch out for this movie! Chances are you're gonna hate this song after you're done with _Chungking Express_. Salt, pepper or sugar may be nice additions to your meals - unless you overdo it. A classic song is always nice to hear - unless it's incessantly blaring at the audience at every opportunity the movie's chaotic action provides.As opposed to that, I liked Faye Wong's Cantonese cover of ""Dreams"" by The Cranberries (one of my favorite bands... and favorite fruits, too; I happened to drink a glass of cranberry juice prior to writing this review). The recurring reggae tune, however, is nearly as exasperating as The Mamas and The Papas hit; no, not the song itself - but its overuse in the movie.If there's something to be praised unreservedly about this movie, it's its visual style. The handheld camera work is mesmerizing, and you get a good sense of what it felt like to visit Hong Kong's Chungking Mansion, a sort of modern-day Tower of Babylon, in the early 1990s; it's safe to assume that not much has changed there since then. You also get several glimpses of ""the longest escalator on planet Earth"" - from Hong Kong Central to mid-levels. It was quite new when _Chungking Express_ was made.Faye Wong is ravishing, but that's beside the point. But, oh, how unrealistic is it when such a paragon of female beauty is introduced to the audience with the offhand remark by the fast-food store owner, ""Faye isn't too bad, either."" Who are you kidding, guys? Would this movie have been as successful if Faye had been *truly* frumpy and unremarkable? (The Slovak film director Dusan Hanak specialized in depicting ""love among ugly people""; and I mean *ugly*.) It's highly doubtful, but that is a dilemma for the entire branch of art called ""moviemaking""; and in this respect, at least, _Chungking Express_, despite priding itself on how original it supposedly is, is in fact thoroughly conventional.",Chungking Express
62,nunoaraujoduarte,movieinthepark.blogspot.com,7,23 September 2011,"Kar Wai Wong compiles the stories of two cops. In Hong Kong, the officers number 223 and 663 share more than their job, they've just broken up with their girlfriends. The first being approached is number 223 (Takeshi Kaneshiro). He just came out of a 5-years relationship and is dying to get into another one while realizing the previous relationship was actually ending. The second (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) had one thing with a landlady and is having great difficulty facing the break up. He is a regular costumer of a local lunch counter, the same where agent 223 used to complain at, and eventually falls in love with its new employee, Faye (Faye Wong). Someone labeled it as comedy, drama and mystery but it could as well pass only as a drama and mystery. A mystery not in the common way, as it's only a reference to certain unsolved scenes, firstly in the first half. Anyway, the prizes Kar Wai Wong won for cinematography are clearly deserved. His image is unconventional, as well as his use of slow motion pictures. But most of all, what you get from this picture, is Wong's awesome reading of feelings such as loneliness and love.

63,sonicheze8,"mesmerizing, ephemeral and bittersweet",10,7 May 2019,"This film is something else. It showcases two stories of two lovesick policemen in the striking Hong Kong streets and alleys. Both lonely and consumed by heartbreak, the film explores in Kar-Kai Wong auteur style, the ideas of love and the human condition. Yet, what I love about it is that it's not overtly pushing these themes onto the viewers. Through the characters and enchanting shots of Hong Kong, we get to float with it, knowing full well that it's too much for anyone to say it's one thing. What we get is the feeling and mood of the movie being emphasized, and that is highly evident throughout the film. Hence, there's a slight sensation of style being prioritized over substance, yet that was the purpose all along.The characters are flawed, quirky and relatable in an odd way. The narrative highly ironic, surreal and yet it's so distinct in the way it's told that it feels palpable. I cannot stress the movie's camerawork more. Slow-mos, snapshots, handheld movement and lightning. All in 1990 Hong Kong, it's hypnotic and beautiful chaos. Kar-Kar Wong's fascination with pop culture also displays itself in the songs in the movie and it's interwoven carefully into the film rather than an afterthought of the shooting. This causes the score to ooze into the style of the film and what great cinema does it make. If you're curious or unconvinced, go watch the California Dreaming scene on Youtube.Characters weave in and out of other scenes, non-linear time, the narration a treat, they all work to make a movie that is uniquely Kar-Kai Wong. It's hard to explain what makes this film extraordinary. Why it feels good and yet so melancholic. Roger Ebert said that it was a film that makes you appreciate film itself.

65,mmendez-22089,Wong Kar-Wai is a G,9,28 September 2015,"Yes! -- Kar-Wai Wong has done it again, and this time he has mixed up his style a bit. I have seen most of his work, but nothing compares to the strange and utter feeling you get whilst watching Chungking Express.This film is a two-parter: One story shows a couple-days-in-the-life of He Zhiwu aka Cop 223 (Takeshi Kaneshiro) who pathetically tries pursuing his ex-girlfriend, May, who is NOW moving on. He buys almost-expired pineapple in can's to figuratively look at how his relationship with her really is. HE IS NOT ALL THAT BAD THOUGH; we do sympathize for his loneliness. It is when he meets a blonde, mysterious drug dealing beauty with a raincoat and glasses, that his world (sort of) changes forever.The second part, and probably the more bigger story, is about another cop from the same part of China, who's name is not really said. The cast-list only refers to him as ""Cop 663"" (played by Wong's alter-ego, Tony Chiu Wai Leung), who patiently is waiting for love to find him; not as assertive as our first protagonist, but still carries a great story. When he finds Faye, a woman working at a stand for her cousin/uncle who is more a part of Cop 663's love-life than anyone else we see, he begins making conversation with her, unaware of her secret plan to personally mess with the belonging in his apartment; move things around, slip drugs his bottles, switch the labels for canned-food items, etc. etc.***It is so beautiful and visually unique how every time, Kar-Wai Wong takes a simple scenario and turns it into a metaphor for ""broken-hearted and lonely"" people. Such as a tree or a train (2046), or a legless bird (Days Of Being Wild), or keys (My Blueberry Nights), etc. In this film, we takes typical house hold items and turn them into ""the dumped"", such as A BAR OF SOAP, which starts out with a weight problem, but progressively get skinnier the more you (wash) use it. Or even A DRENCHED WARN OUT RAG, which needs to learn to contain its ""tears"" and over time will dry up and be happy once again.***ALSO, the camera-work is a show-stopper. The cinematographers of this project knew exactly how Wong likes his footage in post-production, and I believe they made great asset, especially for a film that ""should be recognized worldwide"" CREDITED by Quentin Tarantino).I give this film a PERFECT 10 out of 10 on IMDb, for personal reasons.

66,renelsonantonius,When cops nurse a broken heart,7,6 May 2002,"Cop movies usually feature the heroic exploits of the cop-hero, which include chases, stunts, explosions and, well, women (as seen, for example, in Hollywood's ""Lethal Weapon"" series starring Mel Gibson and in Hongkong's ""Super Cop"" starring Jackie Chan).This has the implication of telling the movie audience that our cop-heroes work themselves to death, in the name of law, duty and public order---hooray!But ever heard of cops nursing broken hearts, who have an obsession for foods and who keep on meditating on their hapless existence? That's actually the kind of cops you can see in ""Chongqing senlin.""The film is unique because it presents two seemingly ""different"" and ""unrelated"" stories of broken-hearted cops and their new-found objects of affection, situated against the background of modern-day Hongkong.Thus, with regard to the element of chance and coincidence, of spontaneous and unexpected encounters, Wong Kar-Wai's film is in the same line with Krzysztof Kieslowski's ""Trilogy of Colors,"" Milco Manchevski's ""Before the Rain,"" Claude Lelouch's ""Chance and Coincidence,"" Alejandro Inarritu's ""Amores Perros"" and Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction.""The ""first"" story tells the story of Ho Chi-Wa (Takeshi Kaneshiro), who calls himself ""police no. 223,"" an undercover agent who was dumped by his lady-love whom he calls Mai;and in order to keep the feelings for the woman alive in his heart, he goes into an obsessive search for cans of pineapples that will expire on May 1, 1994, because Mai loves pineapples and his birthday falls on the said date.The expiration is particularly considered because, in the police agent's opinion, it appears that not just food, but everything else---feelings included---expires.Now comes this alluring lady in raincoat and darkglasses (a big-time illegal drug dealer, actually), whom Ho Chi-Wa meets by chance in a bar.The ""second"" is about Ah-Wu (Tony Leung), who refers to himself as ""police no. 663,"" a traffic police who was also dumped by his girlfriend, a flight stewardess.Depressed, he engages in a pouring out of sentiments to objects that remind him of his failed love affair, but ultimately, clearly ""reflect"" himself---soap, towel, uniform, stuffed toy.However, things might just start to fire up again for the law enforcer when a young and easy-going lady who works as a counter-girl for a food station (where he regularly buys fish and chips and black coffee) develops a crush on him and gets hold of the key to his apartment by chance.Hip, hypnotic and delightful;""Chongqing senlin"" is something that shouldn't be missed.(No wonder ""Pulp Fiction"" megman Tarantino took it on him for the film to be released in the US.)",Chungking Express

68,tntokmenko,A daydreaming romance overflowing with energy and charm.,9,30 January 2013,"One of the strangest love stories you'll ever see, Chungking Express is a two-part adventure where oddball protagonists look for love to fill a void outside their unsatisfying day jobs. The characters are so bizarre you'll keep watching just to figure out what drives them. The camera-work is memorizing with a nice blend of warm colors and skewed angles to capture the wandering streets of Hong Kong. The soundtrack really adds to the intoxicating love-struck style of the film too, where songs become stuck in your head (most likely an intentional result). Performances are excellent across the board as each actor gives their meandering search for love an original twist. This movie feels like a flash-bang of youth, although not in a typical rebel-against-society style, rather a deeper quest in order to fulfill what one wants truly for themselves to be happy. This is a romance unlike any other, and may be arguably Wong Kar-Wai's best feature to date. Keep an open mind and you'll no doubt be pleased. -9/10",Chungking Express
69,neonadventure,Chungking Express: Love Never Changes,8,16 June 2019,"Chungking Express is one of the hardest films to find. Ever. The Tarantino DVD version is the only version of the film most people can afford. The Blu-Ray versions are out of print and ridiculously expensive even for some version of the DVD. (Criterion DVD or Blu Ray) If you own this or ever see this on a low price, might want to grab it if you enjoy romantic dramas.Here lies the Wong Kar Wai's first big film. Starring Takeshi Kaneshiro, Bridgette Lin, Tony Leung Chiu-Wai, and the popular C Pop singer, Faye Wong. The film is divided into two stories, the first telling about a cop who falls in love with a woman with a blonde wig. The woman is actually a criminal and the cop doesn't realizes it. The other story is a restaurant worker who falls in love with ANOTHER cop. (Remember, different stories.) The cinematography is beautiful well done with neon lights hovering over the people. Sometimes can get blurry and give rather a very slow dance of chase scenes or just people walking past by the camera. Time doesn't matter in this story as our main characters tells about the time they do this or that and you can always tell what day it is or what time it would be. The film is colorful and it is visually entertaining. The story is well executed the film's music is leading the way of the film including the famous dance scene of Faye Wong dancing in the kitchen with ""California Dreamin'"" playing on the CD player. There are little items in the story that become so special to our main characters including a can of pineapples. The story is a romantic one. The audience knows that our main character loves one character or another but they could never tell. Just these little moments in life can make it memorable and so special.",Chungking Express

71,thebeautifulones,I became hooked on California Dreamin' because of WKW's use of it in the show.,10,7 January 2006,"I thought the film was simple, yet beautiful Having watched Chunking Express as a kid and having no understanding of its content, I thought it'll be good that I watch it again. The film somehow speaks to me about change.The first story with Takeshi Kaneshiro as He Zhiwu is dumped by May, and later has an obsession with tinned food with the expiry date of May 1st, as a way of remembering her name, and also because his birthday is on 1st May. He becomes enamored with Brigette Lin's character who is an assassin. While she played a small role in the film, she played the role of cold-blooded assassin pretty well.Takeshi played the role of the very emotional He Zhiwu well too.I feel sorry for his loss, yet his willingness to date a second May, shows that he cannot forget the first May. He is of course stood up by the second May, after which he calls up other people as though trying to find out if the people he remembered, remembered him.He Zhiwu, Cop 223: If memories could be canned, would they also have expiry dates? If so, I hope they last for centuries.Then he meets Faye.He Zhiwu, Cop 223: At the high point of our intimacy, we were just 0.01cm from each other. I knew nothing about her. Six hours later, she fell in love with another man.And that man is Cop 663, played by the eternally cool Tony Leung Chiu Wai.Cop 663 strikes me as a man who is afraid of change too. At first he constantly buys chief salad from Faye's cousin, the manager of Midnight Express. Then Faye's cousin asks him to give his girlfriend, the air stewardess a choice between fish and Chips and Chief salad. She picks the latter. The choice business would make her dump Cop 663.Faye Wong plays the role of the girl at the lunch counter who is obsessed with Cop 663 very well too. Her unusual actions (where she plays with the tomatoes, or when she makes the aeroplanes dive into the fish tank) makes me think that Faye Wong is a very weird person. Perhaps in her own way, Faye was trying to force Cop663 to change (adding more goldfish, changing his clothes, his tablecloth, his torn dishtowel...).Cop663: What are you doing in my apartment? Faye: You asked me to visit.When the met again, Cop663 asks for the letter his air stewardess ex-girlfriend left for him. She gives it to him, but he never read it. Then he asks her out.Perhaps change is something which needs time.The show has a good ending though, I won't give it away, but the ending makes you think that if change wouldn't hurt, why not change?",Chungking Express
72,thegreatshonen,ChingkingnExpreess Review,9,8 April 2013,"Randomly found this at a Barnes and Noble for only $30 with the online price going for close to $60 so I figured I should get it. I've always like Wong Kar Wai and his movies. Very indie, very 90's and very good. Chungking Express follows the lives of 2 police officers in Hong Kong and see their love lives. The first is love sick over an ex-girlfriend of his, and eats more diced pineapple than Rick Ross. He meets a blond headed woman at the bar he goes to and hits on her. She leads some kind of Indian drug ring. Midway through its switches viewpoint to another police officer who's in love with a waitress at a local food stand who listens to the song California Dreamin' constantly.This movie is well made and well structured. The acting is great and believable. The soundtrack doesn't distract from the movie. My problem with the movie is the lack of progress and the loose ends of the 1st story. Overall me memorable movie from Wong Kar Wai, and one of the best foreign movies of the last 20 years",Chungking Express
73,donbendell,Warrants a viewing from anyone who considers themselves a serious movie fan,9,25 January 2007,"""Despite on how much has been written about this movie, the basic plot is pretty simple. It's the story of two cops dealing with love and relationships in the fast-paced world of Hong Kong. The first part concentrates on Takeshi Kaneshiro as he pines for the girlfriend who dumped him. Every night, he goes through a series of strange rituals hoping to get her back. When they seem to fail, he goes on a series of binges, first eating all the pineapple he can pick up and then heading to a local watering hole where he gets well and truly soused, after which he meets up with a mysterious smuggler played by Brigitte Lin (in her last film role and nearly unrecognizable in a blonde wig and big sunglasses). The second story focuses on Tony Leung, who also has gone through a break-up, as he develops a strange relationship with a girl who works at a local cafe (Faye Wong).At first, I really did not know what to think about this movie. Like most of Wong Kar-Wai's works, it's at times obtuse and almost overly self-indulgent. However, there are so many scenes in Chungking Express which stick in your mind -- almost like fleeting images from a dream -- that by the end of the movie, or especially after repeated viewings, that it tends to grow on you, like the guy at the bar who you think is obnoxious at first but turns out to be a pretty good chap in the end. I will grant that there are some parts of the movie which seem totally silly and absurd. For instance, Faye has a habit of breaking into Tony's apartment and rearranging his furniture -- and Tony never seems to realize this. There are also parts which seem to translate into movie-making masturbation, such as the seemingly infinite repeating renditions of ""California Dreaming."" The song is Faye's favorite and it plays almost every time she is on screen at very high volume. I'm aware of what a musical motif is, but at times the repetition get ridiculous.But, as I said before, there are a lot of scenes in Chungking Express which hold your attention and make the story more credible as a whole. Perhaps not coincidentally, these scenes are often those which feature the least gimmicks to them, the ones where the actors can simply work. The scenes where Takeshi tries to pick up Brigitte by asking her if she likes pineapple in five different languages, Tony berating his dishrag for not having enough absorbency, or especially the small scenes of Tony and Faye meeting up in a local market and awkwardly flirting, are both funny and powerful in a quiet way. It is in these scenes that Chungking Express transcends typical romantic movie territory because the characters become something more than cookie-cutter caricatures as present in most other movies of the type. Even though their actions seem ""unreal/unbelivable"" (in terms of the romantic movie canon) at first, the more we learn and see about them, the more you feel connected to them -- and more importantly, the more you care about where the movie will lead to.Chungking Express is so well-done that it warrants a viewing from anyone who considers themselves a serious movie fan. If you want to expand your Hong Kong movie horizons to something other than cops and robbers or kung fu, this is an excellent place to start.Chungking Express was actually done during the editing of Wong Kar-Wai's Ashes of Time, as Wong was having ""editor's block"" and needed something to cleanse his palette.As I mentioned before, this was Brigitte Lin's final film role, even though technically, Ashes of Time (which Lin also starred in) came out later. Wong wanted her to wear the blonde wig in order to both poke fun at and take advantage of the Greta Garbo vibe Brigitte carried with her. At this point in Hong Kong film history, Brigitte was a huge star in Asia after the popular Swordsman trilogy, but shied away from the limelight, just as Garbo had. After Chungking Express, Lin (like many HK actresses) married ""out"" of the movie industry with a relationship with a businessman, in this case one of the founders of the ""Espirit"" clothing company -- perhaps, not coincidentally, one of the major corporate sponsors of the movie. In a bit of history repeating itself, Lin in retirement has become like Garbo in her later years -- at least according to various press reports and internet rumors -- staying away from the movie industry and formal interviews, but remaining a very nice person. She can still be seen walking along the streets of Hong Kong (her sister owns a shop there).On the other side of the coin, this was Faye Wong's first role in a movie (though she had worked on a few soap operas before). Even though Chungking Express was a success with both critics and fans, Faye decided to keep concentrating on her musical career and did not make another movie until 2000's Okinowa Rendezvous. On closer inspection though, Faye seems to have a lot in common with Brigitte, which makes a nice parallel with their contrasting characters in the movie -- Faye bring the wide-eyed dreamer and Brigitte being the world-weary veteran. After attaining some success in her musical career, Faye broke with tradition by singing in Mandarin rather than Cantonese, while at the same time bringing more of a western influence to her work (she sings the Chinese cover of the Cranberries' ""Dreams"" featured on the soundtrack). Like Brigitte, she has a pretty icy relationship with the formal press (especially after their reaction to her and young HK teen heart-throb Nicholas Tse's relationship after Faye had broke up with her husband), but is considered to be extremely friendly to her fans.""",Chungking Express
74,dave-658,Wong Kar Wai is a legend in HK,9,27 May 2000,"Perhaps some may not know already, but after Chunking Express, Wong Kar Wai became a superstar and has been treated as legendary in Hong Kong. The film is located in the tourist district of Hong Kong and shows Hong kong to be a vivid, colorful place, which was warmly greeted to by viewers in Hong Kong. I think the film works on at least two levels, the first one being the personal love stories of young people in Hong Kong, and the second is a showcase of Hong Kong, giving the viewer a wonderful tour across parts of the city. Without Faye Wong, however, the movie would be significantly weaker. I think Wong Kar Wai is on the same level as Scorsece. The interesting thing about Scorsece is that he had original ideas in his time and his movies suceeded on that level, and so does Wong Kar Wai. Any critic who does not treat Wong as top level probably has a bias of some kind.This movie is a 10 out of 10!",Chungking Express
75,dave-658,Transcends everything,9,30 November 2000,"This film has two stories; The first is about the come-and-go nature of love and how that come-and-go quality can wreck people; the second story is not about love, its about how love can be utterly everything, at least for a while, and how absolutely everything is shaded, slanted, tilted, and beautiful during that moment of infatuation and dream;There are so many aspects and dimensions about love; the two separate stories are incredibly appropriate; each story has a different angle on the same fire, both succeed wonderfully;The cinematography is icing on the cake, the story and concept is so good it can't fail, Wong Kar Wei's directorial treatment multiplies the experience.The reason why the movie suceeds is that, like every great film, it uses the medium to its advantage; rather than just a visual story, it chops, blends, shakes, slows down, speeds up in order to achieve its impact precisely in the same way our own emotions depend so much on timing and atmosphere; this is why the film transcends so much, it conveys so much about being in love, so precisely.",Chungking Express
76,moviebuffgirl,"THIS IS ART! Funny, quirky, engaging, full of life, New Wave",9,21 July 2001,"Fantastic! See it to prove to yourself that cinema can be art, see it for the action, intertwined love stories, and charming characters played by a luminous and beautiful cast. And it is SO FUNNY!! Definately not a movie that takes itself too seriously, this movie has something for everyone. You will never view the expiration date on canned fruit or hear the song ""California Dreaming"" the same way again. Fans of the French new wave (I admit, Goddard's ""Breathless"" is a personal fave) will be truly delighted. Everyone else should be charmed, or at least visually enchanted by the unique camera work and dazzled by the attractive and talented cast. Both romantic narratives hinge around chance meetings near a fastfood place, Chungking Express. I found the second story more compelling than the first, but both are excellent, and the cast is truly remarkable. Faye Wong, in her film debut, is truly one of the most charming gamine's to grace the screen since Audrey Hepburn.  The character she plays is lazy, dishonest, and a practical stalker, and yet she is such a girlish kindhearted dreamer it is impossible not to love her. (She is an extremely successfull rock singer, and sings the haunting cover of the cranberries song that plays throughout the movie.) Tony Leung, one of the most ruggedly handsome men on the planet,  plays the object of her consuming affection. He is a lovelorn cop whose stewardess girlfriend tires of his quiet decency and seeks a more exciting match. Takeshi Kaneshiro of boyish charm and enchanting eyes plays another lovelorn cop. He is destined to have one night of flirtation with a dangerous woman, played by the enigmatic Bridget Lin who is known as ""the Garbo of Hong Kong."" Their story skirts the underworld, complete with failed drug deals and the justice of bullets. I generally hate violent movies, and cringed at Pulp Fiction, but even the seedy first story in Chungking Express it is not really violent or shocking. The only thing that kept this from being a solid 10 in my book was that the first story (with the blonde Chinese garbo) was kind of confusing and inconclusive.  For anyone who sees this movie-- do you get what is going on with the random white guy who the blonde chinese woman kisses then kills? What is the kitten symbolism? Please drop me an email if you get what's going on in that scene. This is one of the most visually engaging movies I have seen in years, and certainly one of the only movies I have seen where hand-held camera is used in moderation and used WELL. The scenery, especially in chase scenes is a gorgeous impressionistic blur. The use of reflection and shadow is fantastic. It truly presents a new vision of the world, one which resonates long after the last scene, one which seems to refract into the retina of the soul. This is a truly quirky movie. It is slightly reminiscent of the Blue, White, and Red series but is truly unique. (Despite his name arrogantly desplayed all over the video case, Tarantino has nothing to do with this film except that he provided financial baking to have it released in the states. Director Wong Kar Wai is a true artist of film and makes Tarantino's work look like campy self-aggrandizing shallowness)",Chungking Express
77,thediggens,"Stylish, a rare movie bursting with originality and flair",8,19 July 2014,"Wong Kar-Wai's most acclaimed and certainly widespread film, helped by showings to film classes everywhere, Chungking Express is a meandering meditation of loneliness in urban Hong Kong. Told in two separate stories of love, life and loneliness (a third branching off into a separate film, Fallen Angel), they follow two cops dealing with a break-up and a new love interest.The first, shorter and weaker segment follows a pineapple-obsessed cop falling for a blonde-wigged heroin smuggler. The second watches a depressed cop's ignorance as a girl with a crush revitalises his life.The first segment is certainly a visual marvel, and Wong Kar-Wai (alongside cinematographers Christopher Doyle & Andrew Lau, the latter of Infernal Affairs fame) blazes through with a frenzy of action in a confined space. The blur, the colours and the contrast are impressive. It's also a poetic segment, but ultimately falls short, emotionally hollow without developed characters to anchor it. One could suppose that your reaction to this segment will depend on your appreciation of the themes and feelings of the main character.One must spend more time considering the second, which more than makes up for the first ones failings. It adds a wry wit to the -better- romantic undertones, two incredibly charismatic leads (Tony Leung and Faye Wong), and one of the best repeated uses of a single song ever. California Dreamin' will forever for me be associated with this film. More importantly, the second part has a heart, a cute, quirky romance that bubbles, and the incredulity ebbs at its sweetness.The soundtrack as a whole is full of excellent choices, though 'full' may over-exaggerate, as it's better seen as a few choice selections being repeated. Nevertheless, through the cinematography and the soundtrack, the film develops a dreamlike atmosphere, which is probably its greatest asset. The film keeps itself firmly uprooted in the clouds, and it certainly drifts.Chungking Express is a unique film, and certainly not one for all occasions. It isn't designed to blow one away. One drifts through it, then thinks about it after its over. As a technical craft, it's a masterpiece. As a poetic piece of storytelling, its a bit more hit and miss, but it hits more than it misses.",Chungking Express
78,s_cadzow,A Fantastic Film!,8,14 May 2006,"Chungking Express is an impressionistic film of two similar but unrelated stories of love and loss. This film served as the international breakthrough for director Kar Wai Wong. While CE is a darling film in itself, a most enjoyable facet of the film is the birth and shaping of what will later be the auteurist style of film-making that Kar Wai Wong masters in his later films, In the Mood for Love and 2046.Kar Wai Wong manages to present his reoccurring theme of love and its trials and tribulations in CE with yet another unique perspective. The film centers on the love lives of two Chinese police officers: Cop 223,Takeshi Kaneshiro, who relates love and memories to expiration dates, and Cop 663, Tony Leung, who is slowly getting back to dating after he realizes his ex is never coming back. After both officers lose the loves of their lives, they try to cope in very different ways, but both come across woman who will ultimately change their lives forever, one being a drug mover, Brigitte Lin, and the other a free spirited wild thing, Faye Wong, with her heart set on California.A primary contributor to making CE work so well is the curiously aloof script writing of Kar Wai Wong. Every character is so well written and so well executed, that at any time within CE, we could swap stories, or decide to transpose the focus to the female leads and not miss a beat. While all the acting is exceptional, Wong and Leung are easily the most enjoyable aspect of CE. With this being pop sensation Faye Wong's first successful film; her performance won her a best actress award at the Swedish Film Fest. As always, KWW manages to pull a very charismatic performance out of the always-on Tony Leung as he falls for Wong, who works at the local eatery. Wild natured and seemingly uninterested, Wong begins to take a quirky obsessive take to Leung.While CE is primarily about the loss of love and the heartbreak that ensues, the sensually comedic tension between the protagonists adds the perfect compliment of hope and opportunity while invoking a hearty amount of laughs. CE sustains a very successful equilibrium through the everyday life. It is romantic in the way that you butter your wives toast for her, not buy her a dozen roses, the trivial sense of the word.Chungking Express is highly hypnotic and of course, being a KWW film, full of emotion. The film is littered with the early phases of Wong's signature slow motion shots and artistic takes on dialogue heavy scenes. It would seem that no one can capture love and romance in the way that Kar Wai Wong continues to do, and do so innovatively. Love and loss is something we all can relate to, and with the passively touching picture that Chungking Express portrays, it is something highly recommended to all.",Chungking Express
79,azuremorningsky,Hong Kong Art Film,10,7 May 2010,"Chung Hing Express is a film directed by Kar Wai Wong and released in 1994. The film loosely follows the lives of several individuals who live in Hong Kong and in certain scenes encounter each other. The film is very light on plot if your not paying attention you may miss the plot altogether, that is not to say that this film isn't good, quite the contrary its a masterpiece, the cinematography alone sells this movie to me. Although I feel that this film's true forte is the character development of the main cast. In fact the film seems to be more character driven than plot driven if that makes any sense. To put it more clearly plot has been replaced with character development as the main drive of the film. A good example of this is the fact that a lot of the film is dictated by the main characters and instead of talking about the plot they soliloquize about their hopes, fears, regrets and personal feelings. The main themes I found in this movie are disillusionment and the need to connect with other people even if for just a short time.I would recommend this film to anyone who likes good cinematography or character development. If you liked this film I would recommend the french film Amelie or the American film The Fall both films also have strong characterization and cinematic qualities",Chungking Express
80,dinaia,Sensitively Portrayed Characters,7,22 April 2005,"Having watched Chung King Express after I saw In the Mood for Love I realized the director-lead pair has a feel for characters with an deeply sensitive side. In Chung King Express we see characters that long for touch, love, communication, but whose own tendency of over-thinking their life makes them incapable to take action or unable to make a constructive decision. The fast pace of their existence, the volatility of the objects of their affection make them focus their need for stability onto the things around them. They invest the objects with a meaning and soul, in a need to keep their minds alive until something better comes along. The pineapple cans and a whole apartment will be good and understanding companions for their misery. The way they cling on little things to feel alive again is touching, funny and sad at the same time. The story (one of them if not both) is optimistic though, Tony Leung's character finds in himself the smarts to shake off the drowsiness about him and reach out to the immediate, real people near him. It took him a while for his somnolence to 'expire'.",Chungking Express

There are two love stories in this film, that only connect in a few ways. Both men are police officers. Both of them eat at a little 24-hour deli. Both of them have relationships that are grandly influenced by food. Both men are not macho, but rather suffer from their recent heartbreaks. The second one picks up right where the second one leaves off.The film utilizes voice overs more than dialogue to emphasize the characters' internal influences. The editing is quick with flashes of neon lights and color. There are many pop culture and American references, especially in the music.The first story is about a 25-year cop who was just dumped by his girlfriend of five years. In an attempt to stay close to her, he buys her favorite food, pineapple that will expire on his birthday, May 1. After not hearing from her for one month, he decides to drown out his sorrows in a bar. In the bar, he meets a mysterious woman in a blond wig. The woman is in deep trouble from losing a large amount of cocaine. Together, they both need someone, and they spend the night together, but they do not get intimate.The second story is about a cop who decides to surprise his girlfriend by buying her a different dinner, and she decides that she wants to date different men. Faye, a woman who works at the 24-hour deli, falls in love with the heartbroken man. His ex-girlfriend leaves her key to his apartment at the deli and Faye uses it to break into his apartment and improve it while she is ""sleepwalking."" The two eventually wake up out of their fog and meet in ""California.""

83,cutsman-2,Wonderful Little Film,8,2 May 2010,"I wasn't really sure what I was going to get before I watched the Chungking Express. The things I had read about it made it seem like a sort of Pulp Fiction in Hong Kong. The trailer cut my Miramax showed a film and was full of life and apparently dancing. But that really doesn't explain the movie in the least. Express is a film about connections and it follows two particularly baring connected connections. The first connection is between a heart broken police officer and a blonde wing wear, cocaine dealing, woman. He is struggling to get over his girlfriend whom he has been broken up with for a month. From there he meets the vigilante woman at a bar and ends up taking her room, she is in need of some good R&R. Nothing happens and she leaves his life. At the food stand he frequents a new girl has started and he is immediately enamored with her. But as we find out, she is in love with another police officer. The story goes in a bit of weird direction here, delving into the lives of these two very lonely, sad, strange people. The police officer sits at home personifying his home attempting to connect with it on an emotional level, hoping it feels as empty as he does without a woman in his life. He talks to stuffed animals to get his feelings out and to cope. The woman, who works at the diner, becomes infatuated with him and visits his house regularly when he isn't home. There she cleans and brightens up the place. He has absolutely no idea, further proving that he is merely floating through life without a woman. The characters are fascinating and really make the film. The young woman who works at the diner has this strange Yoko Ono look and is obsessed with American music constantly playing the Mamas and the Papas. The interactions use Hong Kong as a sort of background; each of these connections is a chance encounter for the people involved, which seem significant in the most populated city in the world. It makes the connections seem more like fate and therefore heavier. The movie has a fair bit of comedy to it but could of completely stood on it's on from the second act on. The first act isn't completely useless but is never touched on again once it concludes. Feels a bit like an anthology film at times but nevertheless a great film.",Chungking Express

It is an art film with a creative take on the whole connection to life and people, that makes one think about their own life. The movie is full of comedy and awkward moments. It is full of internal dialogue and thoughts. The camera work is unique and takes time to get used to in the beginning. The whole idea of being wanted and desired by someone else starts the whole film off deep. The rest just falls into place with song and comedic moments of reality. I loved it when the cop talks to his apartment, trying to comfort himself, because everyone has inner dialogue of themselves talking to themselves. Everyone does it; there is no shame in that. The characters are a bit out there but we still fall in love with them and cheer them on. I was confused with the first couple, but the cop I that part did serve a good purpose with his ideas of expiration and love. The song played by the second girl gets played a lot, almost to the point where it is your favorite song or you hate the movie because of it. The ending is classic good and long expected between the two ending characters. You can't help but feel good for the two finally connecting and ""seeing"" each other. I recommend this film to all who wish a good time and good movie. The film does have hard to read subtitles at some times but it just takes a while to get used to as the film progresses. Don't expect anything big and flashy, but go in with an open mind and just enjoy the film.",Chungking Express
85,Keltxangel,Chungking Express,7,7 May 2010,"Chungking Express was a great film from beginning to end. I found myself rooting for the young girl that worked in her uncle's food stand. Although she was a little quirky and wasn't completely sane, (she kept breaking in to the apartment of the man that she was in love with and cleaning/replacing things) I felt sorry for her because she seemed so lonely and just wanted the policeman to notice her. I also liked the fact that there was humor in the film. Even though the policeman seems like he has it all together, he is seen talking to inanimate objects in his apartment when he is alone. I really thought it was funny when he was talking to his bar of soap and told it to ""eat more because it had gotten too skinny."" All in all, this movie was very different from any other film that I have seen and the plot was very original.",Chungking Express
86,yorozuya_tsundelea,What a vivid nostalgia,9,11 January 2021,"The lesson from watching this movie is the fact that I sometimes love appreciating and having interaction with ""pretty little things"" (like expired canned pineapple) to remind me of someone I loved (I feel like I am Cop 223) and to seek for new relationship. Anyway, Faye Wong's character came across as a kind of stalker.Most of the audience love ""California Dreamin"" in this movie but I prefer ""Baroque"" (Michael Galasso) so much",Chungking Express
87,Enustik,"If memories could be canned, would they also have expiration dates?",10,9 July 2018,"Chunking express is one of Wong Kar Wai's masterpieces. The narrative is split in two: the first part portrays scenes of the life of a cop, a guy who was dumped by his girlfriend and keeps eating pineapple while waiting for her to come back; and a woman, a drug dealer that coordinates a group of Indians that transport the drug to outside the country. The second part has as main character a girl that works at her uncle's snack bar and dreams about going to California; and a police officer that was, as the one from the first part, dumped by his girlfriend and keeps suffering and waiting for her. All those characters live their lives in a busy Hong Kong. All of Kar Wai aesthetic marks are visible in this film: the use of lighting to dye the shots with deep colors, in case of this film, blue and green; a catching soundtrack with theme songs for each character and plot; the use of a narrator that gives voice to character's thoughts; a lot of tracking, slow motion and fast motion; and characters with strong personalities. The main theme that surrounds this film is the idea of time limit, or expiration date - there are many elements related to this theme, and the narrator keeps wondering about it. Also, what calls my attention is the contrast between female and male characters. While both male characters have been dumped by their girlfriends and the only thing they do is sit and wait for them to come back, the female characters are strong and independent. They are powerful; they travel around the world and follow their dreams. Chunking Express is a very artistic and deep film, and certainly one of my favorites.",Chungking Express
88,furqan-00774,"Movie about feelings, emotions and consolations",9,1 May 2020,"World renowned director Kar-Wai Wong is specially known for his master creation ""In the Mood for Love"", but very few know about this hidden gem; his 1994 HongKong creation: Chungking Express. This movie is about feelings, emotions and consolations. The movie has two stories, one following the other. The first story follows a cop named He Qiwu (Takeshi Kaneshiro) who is having a hard time after his girlfriend dumped him. He then comes across a woman in a blonde wig and finds solace in her. The second story is about a food outlet worker Faye (Faye Wong) and her obsession with a police officer (Tony Leung). The fast paced shots of crowded places used in the movie have left a long lasting impression on me. Each time someone mentions Chunking Express my mind automatically starts playing the ""California Dreamin"" which is used so effectively throughout the movie. The movie is soothing and elevating. It leaves one with a strong desire to watch it again and again.",Chungking Express

Wong Kar Wai is a master at creating a feeling through visual ideas and soundscapes. Faye Wong is brilliant- I couldn't believe acting was only a string to her musical bow.

91,Smooth Operator,A wonderful dreamy romance,9,25 July 2000,"This film is one for the ages.  The way some of the scenes in this film were shot and the way some of the dialogue is presented could have some of you thinking that you were in a dream-like state.""Chungking Express"" isn't flawless, as two of the lead characters in the beginning of the film are nowhere to be found in the ""second"" part of the film.  You may feel as though you were left hanging, wondering what became of them.  If you're able to shut that aspect out of your mind and think of ""Chungking Express"" as two films in one, then you're on your way to what is possibly one of the best romantic comedies you'll ever see.Bridgette Lin and Takeshi Kaneshiro star in the first part of the film, Lin as a mysterious woman in a blonde wig and sunglasses and Kaneshiro as a lonely cop looking for love.  His daily ritual of consuming something very particular and the measures he goes through in his search for someone to be with will have you rolling on the floor.The second part of the film stars Faye Wong and Tony Leung, Wong as Faye, a counter person with a cute personality at Chungking Express and Leung as a cop (Officer 663), who's lost his girlfriend.  Faye seems to have a thing for the cop, but won't openly admit or show it.  She secretly does him favors and is obsessed, and I mean obsessed with the song ""California Dreamin'"".  Her unwillingness to admit her crush leads to some cute and awkward face-to-face encounters with the officer.Love is a wonderful thing.9 out of 10",Chungking Express
92,tempsht2,Horrible...,2,6 August 2006,"I saw virtually no redeeming qualities in this movie. The only thing I did see was Quentin Tarantino's seeming insane obsession for it... There were some attractive women in this movie and perhaps that is one decent quality. Overall however, I found this movie surrealistic and ridiculous. The hand held film making coupled with slow motion and other cinematic gimmicks I found clumsy and dizzying, even sickening. Overall the music throughout was horrible and repetitive to the extreme as well reminding me of psychological warfare of the U.S. military against various malcontents.The various vignettes that made up the movie are haphazard in their placement and unfulfilling and unresolved in their content and ""conclusions."" A depressing movie (not a true _film_, a term I reserve for true art) that left me with a bad feeling. Do not believe the various people that try and spin this as a ""romantic comedy"" though there are certainly isolated elements of both this movie repudiates in content, form, and conclusion any association with this genre.I suggest staying far away notwithstanding the seemingly overwhelming positive views of IMDb and other ratings sources.",Chungking Express
93,MrLunatic,Chungking Express,10,24 December 2019,"Chungking Express is a story that is soft but definitely not weak. Wong Kar-wai shows you everything so clear that you can easily empathize with all characters, explore and understand their emotional state and their longing for happiness. Hong Kong is represented as an ordinary place where people like you and me live their lives, rather than a Triad warfare or a kung fu arena. You take a break from the ''tough cop'' cliche and you witness the daily lives of two police officers doing their shifts without chasing serial killers or involving in shootouts all the time.That feels natural.Probably because the environment resembles a certain place in the city I live where I'm constantly present at. Similar buildings, similar lighting at nighttime and equally crowded. This made it easier for me to engage with the story.I've watched this film in a time where I was only watching films with unusual themes and stories. Action-adventures, sci-fi and horror films on so on. While these genres are hard to make (at least in the right way), I believe turning such a simple story into an impactful cinematic ride requires great ingenuity. It would be safe to say that Chungking Express will capture you whether with its fluency, aesthetics, music or all of those combined. At least this is my hope.",Chungking Express
94,fsevdecoskun,A movie full of colors,9,11 November 2019,"One thing that caught my attention in Chungking Express was the use of colors. A scene in deflated colors was followed by a scene in bright colors. I felt like main characters were represented with certain colors: the cop in bluish tones and the woman with the wig in reddish tones. The tones changed depending on the changing moods, as well. Bluish cop became yellowish when he was slipped by two Mays, and yellowish woman became bluish while being chased by the Indians.
How the chasing scenes were shot was not usual. It was not like a flowing, continuous images coming together, but more like a one still image after another. Such an editing gave me the feeling of excitement that a character would have in a chasing scene and made me feel capture the moment. I felt so blurry, fussy, and exhausted during those scenes as if I was the character being chased. Hand-held camera increased this feeling.
I realized that there were lots of American products displacements or Hollywood kind of events happening in the film. Having meals in Mcdonald's, common use of English, French-fried potatoes, drug smuggling, consumption of canned food, use of fork while eating, use of songs in English were some of them. Was this a way of showing gratitude towards Hollywood or a way of criticism? I could not see a critical approach, rather it was more like showing how such products or behavior is integrated to their way of living.",Chungking Express
95,kelshawd,Welcome to the jungle,7,12 September 2006,"Wong Kar Wai's Chungking Express is truly a motion picture; that is, it's a series of pictures in motion rather than being a film in the tradition Hollywood sense. The storyline and the script appear almost improvised. Plot in western culture typically follows the Aristotilean poetics of a beginning, a middle and an end, with specific plot points that occur at fairly predictable spots in the story. These form the actor's objectives when assembling a character's personality in rehearsal. Wong Kar Wai's film is more in the mode of two short vignettes with no beginning, no middle and no end; this is more like how we experience real day to day life than the artificiality the traditional dramatic arc of rising conflict, denouement, etc.At the same time, the acting style is quite suppressed, and the situations are not very realistic. Police officers in real life have a tendency to err on the conservative side when meeting strangers; you won't find many of them walking into the bar thinking ""I'm going to fall in love with the next woman that comes through the door."" The nature of police work shapes a person's temperament in the opposite direction. This film has to be a parable.The production in this film is quite good. The colors rival productions like Barry Lyndon and the special effects denoting the passage of time (one character pensively holds his coin to the slot in the jukebox, as if waiting for it to drop in by itself, while the passing crowd in the bar speeds past) are clear.The storyline is radial rather than linear, and obviously has stylistic connections to the Cassavetes school of thought. The cinematography is brilliant. The theme (the idea that love progresses and expires according to the same principles that govern something not-human, like the deterioration of food,) is naturalistic, much like Eastern Philosophy of the Tao. (I would never rate any film a 10, because that would be perfect.) Overall, I rate the film as a 7.",Chungking Express
96,danstephan3000,Love in Modern Hong Kong,9,23 September 2004,"Director Wong Kar-Wai quickly established himself among art house cinema circles worldwide as a new voice in Asian film with this unconventional set of tales about modern love in Hong Kong.Before then, he and other Hong Kong directors had stuck mostly with 'kung fu' flicks, using the formulas popularized by Bruce Lee with young audiences worldwide. 'Chungking Express' took a new direction, sweeping the 1995 Hong Kong Film Academy awards and gaining attention at other festivals in Europe and the USA. The first of the two tales portrays a policeman and his thwarted infatuation with a mysterious femme fatale. It mostly rambles inconclusively but introduces us to exuberant, flashing Hong Kong as the setting for the second and much more satisfying love story.Another police officer orders the same meal every day in his lunch break at a little coffee shop, 'Chungking Express.' His quiet, somber manner attracts the attention of the pretty, energetic, but lonely waitress. Then an airline hostess comes to the café and gives her an envelope for him. She peeks inside to see a farewell note and returned keys to his apartment. The waitress proceeds on an outrageously funny quest to become part of his life. She reseals the envelope and returns only the note to him. After learning his address, she goes to his apartment when she knows he's at work and proceeds to use the keys to come in and make herself at home.cleaning and re-arranging.when he's not around. He's so depressed from his breakup that he takes little notice of the changes in his place. Then, one day, he unexpectedly comes back home and opens the door. They are equally startled to face each other. 'What are you doing here?', she demands.'What do you meanI live here!!''Now you shout and scare me so much I can't move my leg,' she complains. 'Help me to the couch.oh, oh, it hurts!!.'This zany exchange introduces us to a delightful love story. Faye Wong as the waitress ('Faye') has a special charm, bringing Audrey Hepburn to mind. Faye is feisty, mischievous, moody......and completely irresistible. The policeman ('Badge 223') is her perfect counterpart, steadfast and honorable but badly needing someone like her for energy and affection. After many twists and some setbacks, they find each other. At the end, we have high hopes for their happiness, even in the crowded, lonely city of Hong Kong with all its insecurities and uncertainties.",Chungking Express

It was so sad that I wish it was not left half finished. And again since I didn't know the plot I taught Faye was the blonde haired girl. Which was my mistake. I watched the whole movie saying ""How come those girls are same? They might look similar but she is such a high spirited now, besides how dangerous and a bad woman she was at first."" Ugh! I think this happened because I wasn't used to Wong Kar Wai's movie style. So should watch again, knowing that this is a very different movie this time.",Chungking Express

Shot during a break from the production of Ashes of Time, Chungking Express proves the theory that a director's best work can be done on the fly.  The plot is rather simple, but the real beauty of the film is Wong Kar-Wai's ability to capture the moods of Hong Kong. From buzzing florescent lights to the bustle of market streets, the cinematography of Chungking Express depicts the flow of city life more closely than any other Hong Kong film I have ever seen.  If this is the new wave of Hong Kong cinema, expect many, many more gems like this one.",Chungking Express
99,anthonygreen93,"Impressive soundtrack, inventive cinematography, yet still missing something...",6,3 September 2012,"Wong Kar-wai's romance-drama, Chungking Express (1994), is story told in in two parts, each consisting of two Hong Kong policemen who are heartbroken from their respective ex- girlfriends. The first story drew me in by the quirkiness of Teshi Kaneshiro's character, He Zhiwu, Cop 223. The seamless charm that he carries with him through all his encounters was particularly engaging and was performed well by Kaneshiro. There was a certain curiosity that left me yearning for more with the woman in the blonde wig, played by Brigitte Lin. Yet, the end of the segment was somewhat unfulfilling, lacking closure and a genuine resolution to the story. However, I still feel as though the first story was more engaging and interesting to watch narratively. Whilst there was far more screen time for the character development of our main protagonist in the second story, it still seemed like we knew Cop 223 from the first, more intimately. This is thanks to the script, containing wonderfully poetic descriptions of his experience with love and heartbreak. When he has eats a month's worth of canned-pineapple that expires on May 1, (in reference to his ex-girlfriend, May) the description that he will either reunite with his love or that it will have 'expired' forever is filled with rich imagery that captured the characters thoughts, flawlessly. The second story had weaker depth of characters due to the confusing plot line and generally less engaging characters. Faye (played by Faye Wong) added some quirkiness to the cast with her strange affection and obsession for Cop 663 (Tony Leung Chiu Wai). The greatest aspect of the second story was its impressive soundtrack. For the whole film, the inventive cinematography using limited funds and unique techniques on a hand-held camera were its greatest strengths and what the film is deservedly recognised for.",Chungking Express
100,helverdi-1,A huge disappointment,5,9 July 2005,"This is the third Wong Kar-Wai movie I watched and it was a real disappointment for me after ""in the mood for love"" and ""2046"". I've loved those two movies and I purchased Wai's boxed-set containing CK Express with eagerness.Today I sat down to watch it with great excitement, ready to find another treasure of film-making. Now I feel like having watched a standard and uninteresting Hollywood-style romantic comedy. I must confess that I liked watching the movie to the end, but this is only related to the fact that I find Faye Wong quite beautiful! It unfortunately seemed to me that the whole movie was a waste of time if you exclude seeing FW for an hour which is of course not a cinematic experience.The first two movies I mentioned above contained many dimensions of the human heart; they made the audience think on the characters, the stories and their own lives. However, the story in this movie is so shallow and the characters are all 2D and very dull. They never surprise you, do or say an interesting thing throughout the movie.The two stories of the movie almost had nothing in common (except being the policemen as the male characters having some kind of love affair with stewardesses some time) and those stories contribute nothing to each other. I wonder why did the director bring them together.The music was also so repetitive and useless after a point. Colour usage and some interesting shots were all that deserved nice comments in this movie.Finally, I must congratulate Wong Kar-Wai for his career path from CK Express to ITMFL and 2046. A great success...",Chungking Express

How can you have any character development or a deep plot when the characters and the story are featured for such a short time? I was enjoying the first part until it abruptly stopped (it didn't ""end"", it just stopped in what appeared to be the middle of the story) to be replaced by an inane and totally unbelievable second part that seemed to focus around a girl rearranging and cleaning a guy's apartment (wow!)

102,mcnimitz04,Good film,7,11 May 2010,"The Film ""Chungking Express"" was released in the United States on March 8 1998. It was written and directed by Kar Wai Wong. The film is about two police officers that are in love and their stories. They have both recently broken up with their long time girlfriends. This movie takes place in Hong Kong in the 1990's. The type of filming that the director, Kar Wai Wong, used in this movie was really interesting. He used a film technique that showed impressionistic splashes of motion and color. The main characters, Cop 663 and Cop 223, are played by Tony Leung Chiu Wai and Takeshi kaneshiro. These two actors played their role very well. They seem to be heartbroken over their breakup with their girlfriends. That turns out to be one of the main points of the movie. Their female lead counterparts are Faye and an air hostess. They are played by Faye Wong and Valerie Chow. An interesting thing that the film makers did in this movie was that they divided the story into two separate parts. These parts are not overlapping and are separated in the middle of the film. This film won several film awards from the Hong Kong Film Awards. It won awards such as best actor, best director, and best picture. Overall, the best aspect of the film was the filming techniques used. They are very innovative and I haven't seen them before. The actors that are in the film are also very good. They played their parts very well. Overall, this was a decent film that portrayed Hong Kong. The acting was mediocre buy the film techniques that were used seem to be innovative.",Chungking Express
103,aerovertice,One of my favorite films...,10,3 May 2010,"Chungking express is one of my all time favorite films. It is a story of human despair and loneliness told with a good measure of comedy; as such, it can be seen as a spin-off of the black comedy, which usually deals with more morbid issues such as death. Although Chungking Express dwells on human despair, there is always a lingering feeling of hopefulness. When you see a down-trodden person, there are three ways to go about: you could either walk past the person with an air of apathy, you could kick him while he is down, or you could wrap your arms around him and hoist him up; this film is the kind of film that sympathizes with the characters and attempt to hoist them up. It shows the audience that sadness and desolation are natural parts of life, but what one must always strive to do is look forward with optimism.The direction of the movie is excellent. The camera works in such a way that it feels as though you, an audience member, is right in on the action, standing beside the characters as an observer; as such, the movie has a deep, subjective feel to it. The movie is jarring at times, but that adds to that subjective experience. There are various points where the movie jumps ahead in timeline in very quick succession, giving the audience the feeling of the fleeting nature of time. The movie does not spoon-feed you, rather, it asks you to think and to feel. The acting feels very natural, almost improvisational, and it is required for a movie such as this. Wong Kar Wai, one of the auteurs of world cinema, has made many great movies since, but to this day, Chungking Express stands out as his best, and one of the best movies, in my opinion, of all time.",Chungking Express
104,coreymoquin,"Commendable risk, but falls flat",5,17 November 2011,"The film Chungking Express which, came out in 1994, seems to be completely devoid of any resemblance to the system of narrative that classic Hollywood movies employ. In fact the similarities in narrative structure seem to be far and few between. Elements such as characters and plot are the main differences in the narrative structure of these two types of films. This is emphatically true with Chungking Express.Pretty much every film, especially classic Hollywood films, have a clear protagonist and antagonist. In a classic Hollywood movie these two character elements are set up within the first ten minutes of the film. However, in Chungking Express these two elements are never absolute. Cop 223 is set up as a protagonist, but he doesn't seem to have a clear antagonist. Nevertheless, he does seem to struggle with depression. Perhaps his depression and sadness over losing his girlfriend is the antagonist to this character. So in a way he seems to be his own antagonist. Another possible antagonist is the girl he meets in the bar who appears to be a drug trafficker. The fact she seems to be distancing herself from him at first is a struggle between the two characters. The second protagonist in the film is Cop 663. He to is struggling with depression over the loss of his relationship with a stewardess, which could be his antagonist. However, he almost seems to enjoy his loneliness because he never makes any attempts to contact her. Again, he seems to be his own antagonist. Then, as was the case with Cop 223, he has a female antagonist/romantic interest. The girl who works at the deli seems to have a subtle interest in Cop 663. This was made clear when she sneaks into his house. Despite her interest in Cop 663 she seems to want to travel to other parts of the world, to California in particular. She can't seem to choose between Cop 663 and traveling until the end of the film and even then it is very vague. The girl in the deli seems to be another protagonist in the film. So the second story of the film seems to have two protagonists almost facing off against each other. However, the protagonists aren't clearly defined. This is a paradigm you basically never see in a classical Hollywood narrative. Another element that is involved with characters is their goals. In a classic Hollywood film the goals of the characters is clearly set up through the plot or independent story lines. Chungking Express is extremely vague with character goals. Cop 223 obviously wants to his ex-girlfriend back, but if this is the case why doesn't he try to contact her? The film attempts to make this conflict into a struggle, but never explains why he doesn't make any effort to get her back. Chungking Express is even more vague with Cop 663's goals. His goals are never conveyed in a definite way. The range of the stories seems to be restricted to the protagonistsAnother main factor of a film's narrative is plot and story. Hollywood films are usually very comprehendible, especially classic Hollywood narratives. Classic Hollywood plots are almost always linked together in a fluid and cohesive type of narrative. Chungking Express's plot would probably be considered a complete mess by classic Hollywood standards. Chungking Express is basically two different films with similar ""stories"". Cop 223's ""saga"" seems to end very abruptly when he is wished a happy birthday. Then Cop 663's story begins. Neither of these stories have any suspense because there is barely any conflict and no deadlines. The struggle and plight of the characters in the film are a result of subtle romances that never seem to fully flourish. Neither of the endings are clearly explained or resolved. This is different than a classic Hollywood film because their endings are always resolved in some way or another.Chungking Express's narrative is very unique. The viewer is basically placed in this world of the film and is given no pre tense and very little information. Then they are expected to almost ""live"" the life of the protagonists in the film. It isn't very often that a film has this sort of power of making the viewer a part of the narrative. The film seems to be intentionally avoiding any sense of a ""normal"" structure that Hollywood has set up. The audience can make up their own minds on whether or not this ""experiment"" is successful, but the risk the filmmakers took is commendable nonetheless.",Chungking Express
105,mr_dark_eyed,I DIDN'T Like It,6,4 November 2007,"I was disappointed after/while watching this film. I loved 'In the mood for love' and also loved 2046. I liked Days of being wild less. But this one was far from the other 3. Faye's character is like mentally retarded or something. was she supposed to be so? and if it's the case, still it was VERY irritating. The first story is boring and unreal. I couldn't relate to the characters,nor their lines. People here say/do things, normal people wouldn't say/do in real life. To me it was one of the main reasons I couldn't enjoy it. The drug dealer looked more like a cross dresser or a man wearing a wig. This character had no weight (and most of the other ones too). The cop.. well.. I never believed he was really a cop. More like a soft, heartbroken high school student. Why should I care at all for him if he decided to fall in love with the first woman (man wearing a blonde wig) that enters the bar? Am I supposed to care about the 2 of them (one of them is a drug dealer and we r given no reason to like)? So by the time the first story ends, you are still waiting for someone in the film to care about, and thus care about the film itself. The fact that Faye went to Cali just like that, instead of meeting him in the café/diner.. and came back as... guess what.. an air hostess! c'mon...I liked some scenes and metaphors, though. The scene were we first see the air hostess at his place, with the instructions playing in the background. The metaphor of the flat crying (when it was flooded with water) or jogging to lose water so as not to cry. the canned memories.. These were typical Kar-Wai.I wonder if 3-Iron was influenced by that film. The idea of visiting flats when no one is there, cleaning and changing things around.. and playing the same song over and over. Maybe not, but it just reminded me of the Korean movie, especially that both characters didn't speak much. Anyway I'm glad that Wong Kar-wai made better movies after. It shows how he grew along the way.. and if In The Mood, and 2046 are his last movies, then he is going on the right track. Of course they all feel like one long movie, all with the same idea, more or less, but he was able to present those ideas in a much better, solid and engaging way in the last 2.",Chungking Express
106,FightinTexasAggies,Reality Check,8,12 May 2010,"Before watching this film, I was told by many of my peers of how great of a movie it was. After being told this repeatedly I was pumped to watch it. In the first five minutes, I was very mad at all of my friends who told me that I would enjoy it. The camera movements I think are what added in to it throwing me off and not thinking I would enjoy it. Also, the woman in the beginning looked like a man to me. I first thought she was a transgender. This combined with the sketchy and different camera movements/ angles made me very confused, but interested, in how the film's plot would play out.The two love stories that the movie portrays I think are really great. Kar-wai did an amazing job with conveying the true meaning of the film to the audience. He wanted us to see how much we, as people, have the potential to greatly impact someone's life in just five minutes. The first love story that is told is of a sadder one. Kar-wai wants us to see that love is great and life-changing but it also has potential to fade away, leaving us feeling very lonely and empty inside. The second story displays a story of unconventional love between two people who met over a fast-food counter. Both of these stories are tied together by them sharing some of the same places they go to just at different moments in time.After watching this film, it can greatly change the way one views their life and reality around them. Kar-wai sends a true, non sugar-coated view of everyday life that transcends how we view life.",Chungking Express
107,janis-zogots,a mix of spices,9,6 June 2008,"Right from the first second you get sucked in the events and lives of heroes of this movie. It's absolute liveliness makes it hard to watch from an emotional distance. It is colorful, full of feelings, joy and loneliness. It is a feeling that comes from a way this movie is shot. Every single shot is a joy to the eye. You can feel the director cares for every shot, each episode. The movie suggests a very claustrophobic feeling, taken mostly in small rooms, crowded market places. If you add the shaky camera movements then all this together emphasizes in a way the loneliness of characters and the struggle avoiding this loneliness. It also serves to emphasize the characters dreams of a better, sunnier, warmer place (more for the second part of the movie).",Chungking Express

Highly recommended.",Chungking Express
109,darrengoh,my top ten best movie,10,23 December 2000,"I rented this movie from Blockbuster out of curiosity since I do understand Cantonese, so I thought it would be fun to see a Cantonese movie. I end up watching this movie twice in one night, now that's rare and so far I only done it once. I bought the video tape from ebay cause I just have to own this one. I had seen this movie about 10 times since. For those in doubt, yes, that's how life in HongKong is like. If you are from new York city, then you wouldn't be surprise with the chaotic life style.  There are plenty of comments already to give an idea what this movie is like. Just two observation, in the first story, the lady holding a big teddy bear toy outside the shop in one brief screen shot is actually Faye Wong. The teddy bear will come into picture later in the second story. Also in one scene when Takeshi running up the elevator after learning that May had a new bf, the air stewardess coming down on the other side is actually Tony Leung's ex-gf on her way to meet him. Pay attention and watch for small clues that patch two story together, it's fun.",Chungking Express

111,krbargen,Hit or Miss? (MISS),4,13 September 2006,"Chung King Express I wasn't really impressed with this movie in several aspects actually and I'm going to start by giving it a 4 out of 10. To back myself up I would like to first comment on the storyline, of which I think is the most important part of telling a story whether it be on film, book, music, etc. I thought it was poorly done and I had a hard time figuring out who the protagonist, main character, was therefore I had a hard time relating to that unknown person and didn't find myself getting pulled into the story. It went from the cop character to the woman back to the cop character to the new girl at the food stand then back to the cop. Poorly done in my opinion. Acting was done fairly well, but not extravagant by any means. Another big thing that was huge in my opinion was the poor job on the production and post-production work. The whole thing looked like it was filmed on a cheap digital camera as far a picture quality and the audio was terrible. Both the Diagetic and Non-Diagetic sound was poorly done. I really didn't like the sound track for almost all of the movie and one of the songs was way over used. Editing was another thing that really distracted me cause it was choppy at parts not flowing well and looked like amateur work. Anything else I try to remember about the movie is blurred because of the poor job on the few things I've already stated. I wouldn't recommend or watch again by choice.",Chungking Express
112,LuSachs,The quirky girl at the back of the classroom.,9,12 October 2021,"Never has such cinematic and storytelling beauty been presented in such a stylish way. The Cinematography is moving but subtle, the plot is captivating, and the acting is brilliant. Wong Kar-Wai puts real beauty on screen and fully immerses you within the 90s Hong Kong aesthetic.The film is essentially split into two halves, both unique and romantic in their own regard, both taking you through the ups and downs of romance and intrigue, and each possessing especially charming soundtrack selection. The parts of the film containing Faye Wong (as Faye) are especially enchanting, not only due to her displays as an actor, but because of the characters' absolute beauty as a human being, in and out.The best metaphor I can think of is that this film expresses itself in ways like the quirky girl at the back of the classroom would. It is at first glance very unassuming, undoubtedly very different, oozes coolness and beauty, and ultimately leaves an impression on you which sticks around. If you ever happen to be recommended this film by a girl, watch it with her and bask in its wonderful weaves of romanticism.",Chungking Express
113,jesta510,Good movie,8,12 September 2006,"I really enjoyed this movie for its jumpy feel and its subtle humor. I didn't really understand the reason why the story and characters switched half way though the movie, but I guess the movie was more about the characters involved in a particular location? This was the first Wong Kar Wai movie I saw and I wasn't aware that his movies just have endings. Not happy endings, not horribly sad endings. They just end. It seems his movies have the characters getting screw over from what they really want by apathy. The repetition of the same song and same events was a nice change from the western films I'm used to. All in all its definitely worth watching.",Chungking Express
114,BrokenNotesMusic,Do you like pineapple?,10,22 September 2004,"From the mind of auteur filmmaker Wong Kar-Wai, comes a film told in the urban alienating streets of Hong Kong. This unique film is split into two separate stories which cross connect with each other in more ways than one.The first story tells of lonely cop 223 (Takeshi Kaneshiro), who is obsessed with expiration dates. Suffering from a broken heart, he's giving his ex-love, May, one last chance. When his canned food expires, so does his love for May. Although on the eve of his birthday he meets a woman (Brigitte Lin), who is suffering from her own broken heart, whom he is able to share his pain with.The second story tells of cop 663 (Tony Leung Chiu-Wai), who is suffering from romantic problems with an air hostess (Valerie Chow). He eases his pain by going to a small time deli express, and meets one of the expresses lovely exployees named Faye (Faye Wong).A great, imaginative, and powerful film that should not be missed by anybody who is serious about movies. Boasting an excellent soundtrack by Frankie Chan and Roel A. Garcia, with songs featured by Canto-Pop queen Faye Wong, along with several other old time hits, just gives me more reasons to recommend this to you. Two huge thumbs up.",Chungking Express

Brigitte Lin,Takeshi Kaneshiro and Tony Leung specially conquered my heart of Asian culture fan,even more than Faye Wong,who simply played good the right character.The other high point in this master piece was Valerie Chow,who is even more beautiful and seductive than I thought previously(I have aways admired her,but after seeing CE,I think she is a goddess).It's a shame such beauty and good acting is ignored by HK cinema. Some the parts I loved the most were the funny conversation between Tony Leung and his stuffed pets,Takeshi Kaneshiro eating all those expired pineapple,and the end,where Tony and Faye's characters meet and the message that their destiny is unknown is left.",Chungking Express

117,Pavan-3,"Great film, but doesn't show Hong Kong much",9,25 February 2001,"After reading everyone else's comments on this film, I must agree it is an amazing film, excellent cinematography, brilliant acting and superb locations. However, those locations aren't really what Hong Kong looks like, as many people who write on this film think.To explain, firstly the title isn't named after the city in China, it is called Chung King Express, a concoction of both the area Kowloon (in Hong Kong) called Chung King mansions and the fast-food stand Midnight Express located in the area Lan Kwai Fong.The first story takes place in Chung King mansions, not exactly a good representation of Hong Kong since it is normally occupied full of Indians, Pakistanis and Nepalese people, which explains all the Indian people in the story. For many Indians, this is their home away from home, and also an area jam-packed with drug dealers.The second story takes place at the fast-food stand Midnight Express, in Lan Kwai Fong. Now Lan Kwai Fong is an area dominated with pubs and bars. It's normally a place where foreigners (white people) go for a drink after they have finished work (e.g. the bar California where Tony Leung goes to). Again, not a very good representation of Hong Kong.Many people think that the fast-food stand is in the same area as the building in the first story. Another misconception. This is mainly due to the fact that the cooks are Indian, but what people don't know is that the stand (which is actually still there now) is owned by a Indian person who was killed a couple of years ago, and the cooks are still Indian.So after watching the film, even though it is excellent, it seems a bit different to a person who lives in Hong Kong, compared to a person who lives in a different country. If you're interested in watching a movie which shows Hong Kong life as it is, check out Wong Kar-Wai's semi-sequel ""Fallen Angels"".",Chungking Express

I've watched the last 5 minutes of this movie everyday since I've purchased it. They way that tony leung looked at faye wong was just the most incredible thing I've ever seen. For me tonys performance was the best, but faye wong was not far behind.im not one for chickflicks because of the absolute cliché romance stories.but this romantic comedy is just nothing thats ever been seen before. It just felt ssoo genuine. Their chemistry was just out of this world.I've always believed that maggie and tony were the best on screen pairing, but faye and tony were just as good but in a totally different way.im not one for romance stories but my god is this one worth watching.

I thought the first storyline about the police officer and the criminal would make an interesting storyline. As I was about get into the movie, the movie was redirected to another storyline. I agree with Jeremiah Long that the movie cuts to another storyline without any explanation. I think the director should stick with storyline between the police officer and the criminal. It would be an Asian version of Out of Sight. However I like the cinematography of the movie. It captures the life of living in the city. Overall I give this movie 5 out of 10.",Chungking Express
121,Jakah,My take on this film,6,13 September 2006,"OK, so it has become very difficult to distinguish which scenes came from which Kar Wai Wong film after watching all three Wong films. I recall really enjoying the characters through and through in Chung King Express, particularly the girl who worked in the restaurant and became the love interest of sorts. Her character was really intriguing and kinda reminded me of a girl I once knew, very spontaneous and quirky. I also liked the first cop depicted in the film and how over-confident he attempted to be with the girls followed by showing the frustration he experienced after not being able to find a girl. I will say however that the particular song that Wong chose to use as the theme song of the film was fun the first, second and maybe third time, but after that it just became incredibly irritating. I'm personally not sure if he was trying to reinstate particular emotions, but it couldn't and didn't work for me that many times throughout the film. All in all the story was fun, but some of the other components got to me too much.",Chungking Express

123,cragybgoode,How is this not in top 250!!!,10,2 November 2006,This film in a simple sense is perfect. The only reason I can see why its not up with the best is because it simply isn't well known enough.I don't know where to start so Ill start with what I thought was the most noticeable from the start is the editing. It was shot in such a unique way that mixed many P.O.V shots and close ups that you felt physically and emotionally close to the characters. Also the staggering frames at the start as they are running is really quite original and gives a real dream like feel. And there is the way the narrative is told which is so unique and so strange to follow so it makes you focus extra hard on what your seeing so much that your absorbed into it.The acting is also as I have already said perfect they give you a sense that these characters are real and the feelings of alienation and loneliness are simple emotions every one is familiar which makes the characters so relatable (for me it was like looking in a mirror with the male leads) Even the soundtrack was used to its full effect throughout and the version of Dreams by The Cranberries in this was excellent with the Chinese lyrics.I could go into even more detail but I just cant express enough how much this film needs to be seen and if you have seen it lets just try and get this in top 250.,Chungking Express

Soon, I realized that the film was much more. The film had two guiding plots: the cop who had just lost love and the cop who would soon find it. A yin/yang love story put together masterfully. The plots flowed together one right after the other and if you weren't paying attention, you would miss the transition. The strongest part of the film was the character interaction. The actors of the film were sincere and realistic. I believed in the characters. I believed in their emotions and conflicts. The second strongest was Wong's cinematography. Each shot had purpose and pushed the feel of the film. The contrast of every shot was beautiful. I recommend this film to anyone who wants a romance without Hugh Grant.",Chungking Express

Another aspect of the movie that i thought worked really well was the acting.

I liked how it just went from one story to another with no explanation, It kind of reminded me of Lost Highway a little bit in that sense. I thought the cinematography was very well one. It was kind of fast paced at the beginning and followed the story line where as it slowed up in the second story. I thought the film was very well acted and the directing was top notch.

134,zach-735-707860,Not Your Typical Romantic Comedy,9,11 May 2010,"I really did not know what to expect out of this one. American trailers make it look like some sort of action comedy film full of stylistic editing. Now while the film does boast some relatively familiar stylistic Hong Kong action with a few seconds of slow motion gunplay, this film is no action film. However, in a way I was pleasantly surprised by this. Now I am not necessarily a big lover of the romantic comedy film genre, but this film is something more. It is a sort of romantic comedy but the distance the characters keep among another yet retain a sense of chemistry is a whole other style of romantic comedy. The editing in the film is nicely done with its already mentioned stylistic creative manner. The well done cinematography through the alive downtown city setting also contributes to this well blended editing to film process. The acting here is very well done, once again, the chemistry among the actors is undeniable once their characters accept one another. I also enjoyed the unique idea of showing two narratives happening in the city, you almost get two films set in the same location. Also both stories are contrasted enough for each to add its part to the film yet both keep a sense of familiarity in the values its portraying. Now where this film really thrives beyond its creative relationship scenarios is its ability to deliver light hearted comedy at the right moments. The comic relief in this film is perfectly paced amongst the film's emotions. This is a romantic comedy at heart but is in a league of its own. Overall this film's films better than sub par acting help push its boundaries with its romantic yet surreal style of storytelling. A real unique gem from Hong Kong's Wong Kar-wai.",Chungking Express

Well the first character, turning the cans of pineapple into this great huge symbol of his undying love for his ex. It was just a awful reminder how stupid love makes all of us. There were some excellent shot in this film. I love how the camera often takes a long shot with the subject far away conveying a sense of solitude, that bitter loneliness. The second cop in the film, just baffled me, i am not sure if he honestly was just not making the connection that things were changing or what?...its was just so ludicrous. At first i did not understand the movie i didn't really get the connection between the two stories save for the brief connection at the restaurant, until someone pointed out that the movie centralized around the restaurant, realistically and just happened to follow the characters as a result.

138,curved,One of the sweetest love stories in years,8,5 June 2000,"Around the time that Chungking Express was hitting the festival circuit, Pulp Fiction was being released to American audiences and mass acclaim. With such praise people have to dig up some dirt, so an association with Jim Jarmusch's similarly disjointed film Mystery Train was created. Somehow, Chungking Express was caught up in this confusion which is when I became aware of its name, but never the actual film. A few years later I had heard that Tarantino's Rolling Thunder pictures was releasing Chungking Express to America, finally. But once again, I could not find it anywhere!As accidents happen, I was at Blockbuster here in Uptown in Minneapolis and thought I'd check their racks (it's a little more progressive film-wise than my hometown of Des Moines, Iowa.) As luck would have it, there was one copy in. I rented about six films that week and Chungking was saved for last. And it certainly was the best.The basic premise is of love lost and love found; the chaser and the chasee. Chungking Express is split into two separate (yet sort of related) narratives. In the first we follow Qiwu, a Hong Kong cop who's recently lost the love of his life, May. Qiwu's current beat is in font of a take-out counter in Hong Kong where he talks to the owner about his broken heart. As Qiwu counts down the days until the one month mark is hit, he starts to open up to the idea of seeing someone else. Qiwu has a wonderful ritual which he follows in this month!The second story is the better (and the longer) of the two. It picks up with another recently heart-broken cop (Tony Leung), working Qiwu's old beat in front of the take-out counter. But this cop doesn't share Qiwu's interest in other women. At home he speaks softly to his stuffed animals, soap, and frail handtowels about love lost. He avoids the obvious signals that Faye, the new worker at the restaurant, is sending. What Faye does to rope the cop in is far-fetched, yet wonderfully beautiful. People cry over Sleepless in Seattle which I don't quite get. It's unrealistic and on top of that, it's not terribly interesting to me. Meeting through the mail? Go on. But Faye's timidness leads her to do something not only sweet, but interesting. You'll have to rent it and see for yourself.The last reviewer mentioned both Godard's Breathless and Blade Runner in reference to Chungking Express and I couldn't agree more. The story has many Godard/French New Wave-influenced elements, and, oddly enough, a very similar feel to Blade Runner. At the end of the Rolling Thunder edition, Quentin Tarantino suggests watching Godard if you like this film. My problem with that statement, and with Godard in particular, is that his (and other French New Wavers) French backdrops aren't as interesting as Kar-wai's Hong Kong.  It's infectious, as is Faye Wong, the lovely restaurant counter girl. Tarantino also mentions that he hasn't met anyone who hasn't walked away from Chungking Express with a crush on Faye Wong. Maybe YOU should try!!",Chungking Express
139,srgilliem73,A beautiful film...,10,8 July 2006,"I had previously seen Wong Kar Wai's two most recent full-length films (In The Mood For Love and 2046) and enjoyed them greatly. I just recently purchased the rest of his catalogue and have been viewing them in chronological order. Tonight I watched Chungking Express. This film, like all of his films, deals with isolation, loss, and missed connections. It contains two separate stories which, on the surface, are not related. The first story I found to be intriguing though not really so inspiring. The second (which comprises the bulk of the film) was simply amazing! WKW really has a way of placing you into the emotions of his characters! His is an extremely voyeuristic style to film-making. As the story progressed I started to feel uncomfortable as a result of one of the characters' behavior. Then the discomfort gave way to exuberance and I was smiling and even laughing along with this character. I began to sympathize and (god forbid!) even condone what was happening. When the character's game came to an end (as it had to do) I was scared for her but was relieved when her victim(?) also sympathized and condoned her behavior. Then, the story took a turn and it broke my heart in a most profound way. WKW's stories always break my heart, but this one REALLY HURT in a more personal way! I'm not really sure why. But after all the sadness and pain, this story turned around and put the pieces back together! Beware! This is not a film for mainstream junkies! If you enjoy challenging and thought-provoking movies, then this is a definite must-see! If you have primarily subsisted on a diet of mainstream Hollywood fare but are curious to see the treasures that are possible with daring film-making, then this movie is an excellent gateway drug!",Chungking Express
140,Paddosan,A little masterpiece,10,3 June 2008,"Since the first time i saw this movie, thanks to a friend in love with Asian cinema, i got caught by the melancholic stories of this movie's characters. For a period i was used to watch this movie a couple of times a year, and i made friends see it, because i think it's really an example of what makes cinema really great.Two simple and yet extraordinary stories are told by Kar Wai Wong, in a way that makes you feel closer to the two cops, or the two ladies. I will always remember with a smile Takeshi Kaneshiro getting a stomachache due to the enormous amount of pineapple cans he ate, or Tony Leung talking to a dishcloth in his kitchen. It's stupid and yet incredibly human. Even the way Faye gets caught by the lonely cop and stalks him, going into his house to clean it, even changing stuff or buying him new things... it's silly, but it's human and the director shows it with class, with hearth.Kar Wai shows us nothing more than the stories of human beings, but the way he does it, and the way the actor represents these little stories, is what makes cinema great.

142,placeourbets,style and more style,7,15 May 2007,"In the midst of the rising popularity of the Asian gangster/Martial Arts films in the United States during the 1990's Hong Kong director Wong Kar Wai helps portray Eastern civilization in a more realistic fashion with his film Chungking Express. One of the main reasons Kar Wai's art house film had a lasting impact on American audiences was due to the fact that American director Quentin Tarintino released it under his Rolling Thunder Pictures label (with his face on the cover and all). Chungking Express is certainly not a film audiences would expect to come out of Hong Kong. It is a stylistic journey which travels through the lives of two heartsick police officers who have a hard time freeing them selves from the past and grasping reality.The title Chungking Express is derived from the Chunking Mansions in Honk Kong where the majority of the film takes place. The Chunking Mansions are a huge babel of cultures under one roof where people can shop, live, eat, etc. The setting greatly helps the story achieve a sense of disconnection from society, and a stronger sense of alienation. Chungking Express is contrived of two total different narratives. The first story which takes place is the account of a brokenhearted young police officer who we know as Cop 663 (Tony Leung Chiu Wai). He spends the majority of his time pondering on his previous relationship with a woman named May. His strategy to cope with his loneliness consists of eating cans of pineapple which expired on May 1st, which is his birthday, his ex-girlfriends favorite fruit, and is a month after they broke up. Cop 663 says ""If May hasn't changed her mind by the time I've bought thirty cans, then our love will also expire."". This is certainly not the healthiest way to cope with depression, but everyone has there own method. During Cop 663's recuperation we are also introduced to a mysterious woman (Brigitte Lin, in her last film) who wears a blonde wig, a trench coat, and dark sunglasses. She is a clear homage to John Cassavette's Gloria. The mysterious woman is in fact a heroine trafficker in the Chungking Mansions, who uses Indian families to transport drugs. When May 1st arrives the two characters find themselves drinking with each other at a bar. In hope to shed some light on the officers situation she leaves him a message telling him a happy birthday. Such a small act of kindness can go a long way in the mind of a bleak discouraged human.The 2nd plot also consists of a lovesick police officer who we know as Cop 223 (Takeshi Kaneshiro) who has recently been left by his stewardess girlfriend. He spends his time at a local eatery, which connects the two plots, in the Chungking Mansions where he orders his usual playing old chefs salad. His approach to cure his depression consists of talking to several inanimate objects around his house which include a bar of soap, stuffed animals left by his girlfriend, and a washcloth. A young woman named Faye (Faye Wong) who is an employee that is a free-spirited young woman that has a great love for The Mamas and the Papas track ""California Dreamin"" secretly falls in love with Officer 223. She breaks into his apartment, not to act as a stalker, but to simply pump happiness into his life by feeding his goldfish, cleaning his house, and slipping sleeping pills into a bottle of liquor to make him get some much needed rest.Certainly Chungking Express is not a typical romantic comedy or drama relative to Western cinema. We watch how males cope with the loss of love in very unusual ways, and how the vibrant female characters help enlighten their situations. A typical audience might think that a simple happy birthday might be too little to make someone happy, and breaking into a lovers house might seem obsessive. But it is fact that people find solace in a variety of ways, and Kar Wai uses this to his advantage. Kar Wai manipulates nearly every aspect of film language . With his fellow cinematographer Christopher Doyle they truly make Chungking Express a cinematic experience. He uses leitmotifs throughout the film such as Dennis Brown's reggae track ""Things in Life"", and The Mamas and the Papas track ""California Dreamin"". If you are looking for a great sense of cinematic style Chungking Express is the film for you.",Chungking Express

But when we encounter someone we get to know very few things about a person. People are changing constantly, that makes it almost impossible to get to know somebody entirely. A poetic telling of two tales. Two cops are dealing with their heartbreak and in the process of overcoming they find themselves falling in love again. Cop 223 played by Takeshi Kaneshiro gives his love an expiry date - May 1. Until then he will accept that his girlfriend broke up with him. He encounters a mysterious woman wearing a blond wig played by Bridgitte Lin. They share a brief moment of their lives together, so powerful that both of them will remember it forever. In the second half of the movie the story involves Cop 633 played by Tony Leung, who falls in love with Faye, a girl working at the snack bar, always dancing and daydreaming, played by Faye Wong.

148,Rizwanbinriaz,A Complete Surprise!,9,19 February 2012,I watched this movie only as a diversion from the European and American movies I usually watch. I have seen and appreciated many Asian flicks too. But I hardly expected anything like what I actually found. This slice of life is made and performed with such affection and profound feelings that it reached out to the most tender side of every human being thus acquiring a universal appeal. It is a real treat. It is most likely to haunt its viewers long after they've seen it. I never knew Asian Cinema had achieved such high level some 18 years back. It behooves me to now watch all other works of this great director Kai Wai Wong.,Chungking Express
149,chiend1,This snoozer is a loser,1,5 January 2006,"For those deciding whether or not to watch this movie and are reading these comments for insight, I first offer these four words: Don't waste your time! ""Chungking Express"" was shoddily filmed, slapped together quickly and seems as though it were conceived in its entirety by someone standing in line at a Hong Kong Burger King. I can't remember ever watching a film with an assortment of such one-dimensional characters trying to work their way through a script this mundane! It's an absurd effort with philosophically ridiculous dialog (a man wanders into his flooded apartment and offers the stunning revelation that ""tears can be dried with a tissue, but water takes time to mop up""). The same character is also seen carrying on a deep, meaningful rapport with his towels, soap, stuffed animals, dirty laundry, etc. The shaky, wandering, hand-held camera-work was another annoying feature I could have done without. And if that isn't enough to make you puke in your popcorn, we hear the old 60's ode ""California Dreaming"" by the Mamas and Papas blaring over the soundtrack over and over again during a particularly lengthy sequence.Quentin Tarantino was responsible for bringing this loser to America through his Rolling Thunder Productions company, though I cannot for the life of me figure out why a man with his talent would bother. He was known to have remarked, ""I'm happy to love a movie this much."" A lot of us, though, hope he will concentrate on making his audiences happy with more worthwhile discoveries in the future.",Chungking Express
150,riadthealig,A wonderful act by the Hong Kong maestro,9,13 December 2018,"This was my first viewing of a world cinema. I had heard a lot about Wong Kar-wai from my fellow cinephile friends, and wanted to watch his films since long.
As I started to watch this, I began to feel like I have never watched something like this before. I really loved the first story a lot. Especially the scene where the lady with the wig is chased by the goons of the smugglers, and the whole thing is shown in a hand held, shaky camera, that gave me goosebumps!
To be honest, I was initially disappointed with the second story. I thought the film would be fast-paced thriller, and in the second story it felt like the pace of the film had slowed down. But gradually I began liking it, and by the end of the film I was really left immensely pleased by the cinematic experience.
This is a wonderful work by the Hong Kong maestro. Look forward to watching his other works.",Chungking Express

154,rudesoria,"Love lost, love found. A beautiful balance.",9,15 October 2009,"Chungking Express is the story about love lost and love found. However to simply leave it at that would be a gross undermining of what the film is all about. There is a lot more to this film and it really is no wonder why it won so much recognition at the 1995 HK film awards.The film is divided into two parts, primarily segmented by the encounters of two love forlorn policemen who try to deal with their recent breakups and the women they subsequently encounter. The first story revolves around a Taiwan-born cop and how he meets a mysterious drug-smuggling woman in a blonde wig, The second story shifts the focus onto another police officer (Tony Leung) and how a woman (Faye Wong) who works at a snack bar he frequents slowly falls in love with him.The real beauty of this film, like most films worthy of recognition, lies within it's execution. Much of he first story is shot in what can only be described as a drug-induced blur on life, or if you're familiar with your art - what an impressionist painting would look like if it's subject matter could move. The second part on the other hand plays around with extended time lapses where two characters would move very slowly as time around them speeds up really fast. While both halves were distinctly different, Wong was able to create such an immaculate balance of style and cinematography that the elements of how both story-lines were portrayed complement each other perfectly. There's also wonderful symbolic use of imagery if you have the eye for it, but I won't divulge the details at the risk of ruining the experience for you.Tony Leung's impeccable performance here really leaves no room for doubt as to why Wong chose him for so many of the roles for his later films as well (In the Mood for Love, 2046). Expectedly, his character is distraught over how things played out with the recent breakup, however his sadness is never seemingly pathetic. No shedding of tears, no bursts of emotion or lament --but as I watched him carry on I really couldn't help but feel the depth of his sadness.Faye Wong, oh man. Don't get me started on Faye Wong. I've listened to several of her songs in the past, but I never knew she was this cute. She's so, so cute. I digress. Despite Tony Leung's outstanding performance, she is definitely not out-performed. If anything, she probably draws more of the attention with her quirky demeanor and cutesy dancing, and the underlying empathy she indirectly evokes is both moving and poignant.On the music - The soundtrack used in this film is fantastic. Dennis Brown's ""Things in Life"", ""California Dreaming"" by the Mamas and Papas, as well as Dinah Washington's original ""What a Difference a day makes"" all provide an excellent balance to the wonderful visuals brought out by Wong. There are numerous scenes where songs like ""California Dreaming"" were much louder than the actual dialog on extended occasions. In spite of this, it never distracted from what was going on but complemented and accented the mood which is exactly what music in a film should do.If you haven't experienced the brilliance that is Kar Wai Wong, I highly recommend Chungking Express as the perfect starting point.",Chungking Express
155,renderings-1,Fantastic Movie,10,25 July 2009,"One of the most innovative movies of its time. It was shot within a short period of time in between filming other movies. The story is confusing at first because you don't expect to know what is going to happen from minute to minute. The suspense - whether it's love or action in the beginning leads you throughout the entire movie. I think it qualifies as a masterpiece of Chinese film work. My favorite part of this movie is the second half. You actually feel as if there is chemistry between the two characters.A lot of people love the movie Amelie, but I think much of that movie was borrowed from this one - especially the scene in which she goes into the cops apartment and rearranges his furniture.Unfortunately, I don't think Wong Kar Wai has matched this films quality or randomness of story line since then.",Chungking Express
156,gabriel-john-strange,"A midst pining, sometimes a second chance is right in front of our eyes.",10,30 March 2013,"WARNING: SMALL SPOILERS MAY BE GIVEN BELOWToday being a lazy Sunday, I finally got around to watching Chungking Express. This film is something which has always been on my lengthy cinema bucket list.I am joyous that I took the the time viewing into this film as it was both uplifting and meditative amongst the chaos.The film's plot revolves around two separate narratives regarding two policemen working within Chungking,both of whom have gone through recent break ups. Their stories are told sequentially and are both running in chagrin until they encounter a new woman.For the first story, we become acquainted with He Qiwu, a man who pines over his most recent relationship with a girl called May. Whilst the May of which his relationship recently ended with has no screen time, there is plenty of monologue spoken from He Qiwu and interaction with other characters regarding her that as an audience we can feel his pain. (I mean, who hasn't been there before?) He Qiwu goes on the rebound and seeks out a girl after much self pity. It is at bar that he encounters a certain femme fatale.The femme fatale is not issued a name in this story segment however it just adds to the sense of mystery she aesthetically displays by the ""costume"" of which she wears: A Blonde Wig and Glasses. It becomes quickly evident within the first fifteen minutes of the film that she is a dangerous presence as we see her organizes an illegal drug smuggling operation. When He Qiwu and the woman with the blonde wig cross paths, it is not because he is after her. It is because he found himself out at a bar on the prowl and as we as viewers are sure of, the ineluctability of them meeting together is certain. They are not united together as lovers, however there is a slither of hope given to He Qiwu after their encounter and in his current position, a morale booster.In the second story, the unnamed Cop 663 is going through the motions post break up with an air stewardess. We see that the stewardess had decided to visit a snack counter which he frequents and gave a letter to the owner regarding her wishes to break up and keys to the apartment. This is all caught by the exuberant Faye, a worker at the counter. As Cop 663 does not wish to look at the envelope being fully aware of what the letter will detail, Faye falls him for and uses the keys to start rearranging the house while he is at his day-shift unaware. From there, the story builds around the meetings between of both Faye and Cop 663.Throughout both stories there are reoccurring motifs that we take in such as expiry dates, the name of May, a model airplane, California Dreamin' by The Mamas & Papas, a Garfield stuffed toy and more which have been omitted from this review. The symbolism behind these help build the strength of both stories and also slightly relate them. The setting of Chungking is a multicultural place and in being so it is interesting to hear dialog hear dialog in Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese and Indian throughout the film. It is hard for the setting to not draw you in. However, despite the streets being as flooded with populace as they are, we are left with the contrast of the characters usually being in isolated locations. Taciturn and with a running self monologue.The soundtrack should be a key player in any film watched and in The Chungking Express it is not something which is not to be ignored. Most notably the soundtrack is dominated by California Dreamin' during the second half of the movie. The highlight song for me personally is a delightful Cantonese cover version of the song ""Dreams"" originally performed by the Cranberries sung by no other than Faye Wong, main actress of the second segment.In regards to the cinematography, it is hard to believe that shots being taken are not being done so under natural lighting. In a scene where the Indians are assembling clothes and toys, we get various cutaway shots and amazing editing. (In particular one shot of shoes filled with cocaine/heroin being put away is shot upside down which for unknown reasons I really love) The editing is quick and fast paced, rarely lingering.Through the use of shaky held hand camera during chase scenes and the busy streets we feel disorientated and just as lost as the characters on screen. I believe this film is an equally a comfort to those in love as to those who are out of love. Don't give up.",Chungking Express

Cinemotagraphy was totally sophomoric, and the story line unrealistic and childish. Acting was horrible too. None of the main characters had shown any real emotions, especially Kaneshiro's.Maybe something got lost in translation (I watched it with English subtitle), but none of the lines was clever, and it was really really boring in the name of being artsy movie.

159,efeolut,i don't want anyone watch this because chong qing sen lin is nly mine and always will be,10,12 October 2005,"Giving an 11 would be more fair to this masterpiece. Trying to get satisfied with 10 points breaks my heart as much as the stories in the film did which are based on two men suffering from love, like the other millions on the planet. The main difference between this one and other romance films is Chong qing sen ling doesn't picture eternal love, people holding hands in hands, kissing or crying and moaning in pain when it's is over. It's more about lead characters just trying to get over the pain and discovering that undying love was never that strong indeed. Talking about getting over the pain, since it's a Kar Wai Wong nobody will dare thinking a typical work.At the first time i watched Chong qing sen ling, what hit me was director's original style in telling his stories, how he could make me feel exactly the same mood with the characters and still no tears in the whole movie. (Besides who needs tears while you can get rid of them by making some sports?) In fact if you are terribly under the influence of this film and you are dumbed by your lover too, don't be surprised when you find yourself drinking five or ten glasses of water in a row or something equally stupid as that. Because stupidity is what we are expected to do when messed with love anyway. Before, through or after the relation, it really doesn't matter, does it?After you watch Chong qing sen ling you won't be the person you used to be. At least California Dreaming will have a special place in your heart, i guarantee that!",Chungking Express
160,ramandsa,"To my newfound love of my life ""Chungking Express and Faye Wong""",9,9 June 2019,"I never share anything personal but honestly speaking, I have fallen in love with the movie ""Chungking Express"". This film by Wong Kar-Wai (for me) captures the essence of what it feels to fall in love, and it has changed me and how I see (and want to see) my life. I don't ever want to go back to the way I was before. This film which concerns ""more with the materials of a story than the story itself"" with great cinematography shows us the lives of various melancholy people wandering across the same streets of Hong Kong. The director Wong Kar-Wai uses these streets and places as a medium to depict how different stories which are mildly related unfold in these same places and (according to me) these places are the real storytellers rather than the people itself. They are the silent witnesses.As for famous music sensation Faye Wong, I think Q. Tarantino said for all of us ""I don't know anybody who hasn't seen this movie hasn't gotten a crush on her"". This was her first ever movie, and it seems that her character in the film was made only for her and no one else could have pulled this off.Moreover, I feel like watching any other movie from this point onward I will be disappointed.

162,JomoRising,The way men love!,8,8 October 2005,"There is something very personal and intimate about this film that I missed the first time I saw it. Chunking was recommended to me by a friend of mine whose opinion I value, so I tried it again - and I believe I got it.Looking back on many of the romantic films I have enjoyed, I noticed that the main characters are usually women. Even those with men don't delve with any sophistication into the male heartbreak. As a result, I am not sure I know how to properly grieve a failed relationship. LOL.Here the heroes both suffer from failed relationships. In the first story we don't really see anything of his relationship, we just see that he held on a little too long. More important than the relationship or the reason it didn't work is the aftermath and the acute dysfunction with which he approaches the next. In his first 'May Relationship' he claims the failing was not knowing enough about her so he tries to 'get to know' more about his new 'blonde' love.In the second story, the cop falls in love with a woman he doesn't even know. How about that for consistency of the way many of us dudes love? When we fall for women, we often fall for the idea of what they represent to us at the beginning rather than the reality of what she is. The shot that Wong Kar-Wai captured in the second cop's apartment in which the heroine hid on the wall in plain sight and the cop looked in the bathroom missing her completely was a fair characterization of the film. --- The male characters fell in love with the idea of a predefined woman and missed, in essence the women that were right under their noses.Ultimately fascinating.",Chungking Express

167,sam-lam,Big disappointment,1,8 October 2005,"Be warned! This is crap that other crap won't even deign to be in company with because it's beneath them! Okay, got that out of the way, let me say something more substantive.I've seen Ashes of Time a very long time ago thinking it was a fresh take on the material which is based on a highly revered wuxia tome of a novel due to the emerging reputation of the director, Wong Kar Wai. Well, despite of all of that WKW hasn't succeeded at adapting the novel on screen according to a lot of wuxia fans; mostly it is just shots of dripping water, beads of sweats, legs of horses running, etc. I couldn't sit through most of the movie.Fast forward many years later when I wanted to give Mr. Wong's movies another shot after hearing many praises, especially from Cannes. I was intrigued by his latest, 2046. A friend told me to start w/ Chungking Express because it is his most accessible movies. So wrong! I was just p.o. that I got duped into wasting my time and money on this piece of pretentious nothingness. Some professional reviewers mentioned it as a meditation on alienation and loneliness in a modern big city, blah, blah, blah. It's all fine if the director has a point of view with something to say as to why these things happen and tell it. But no, he merely shows what is. Faye Wong's acting is very typical of Hong Kong's style: garbled enunciation, deer in the headlight wide eye expression, try to be cute and girlish kind of acting; the rest of the cast is equally uninspired.I think the word, Auteur, is a euphemism for a director who tries something new and different, which is to be applauded, but not one who hasn't yet mastered the art of cinematic story telling, which is what Mr. Wong is, for the last 17 years!",Chungking Express

A great double plot with versatile characters, with colors and Cranberrie's Dreams stuck on your mind. A dream you don't want to hinder. Wow.",Chungking Express
169,theolm_,Snapshot of Hong Kong explored through quirky characters,7,23 September 2010,"Chungking Express, directed by Wong Kar-Wai, is a snapshot of Hong Kong, set in the Tsim Sha Tsui area, a very cultural, busy and overpopulated urban centre. The film mainly explores the themes of developing romances and break ups but the action is very connected to the location and elements of crime creep into the story, representing the criminal elements present in urban Hong Kong.The film contains two separate stories but have similar characters in both and both include the same fast food store. The first section of the film is about Cop 223 (Takeshi Kaneshiro) who has just broken up with his girlfriend of five years. He is heartbroken over the breakup and laments the perishable elements of life, and as such obsesses over expiry dates. Another character we follow, who eventually bumps into Cop 223 in a bar, is a woman in a blonde wig (Brigitte Lin), involved in the drug world and running from her boss after she loses the smugglers she had hired. This section of the film has more of an action feel with chase scenes that are filmed very shakily and with a strange temporality.This story ends abruptly and we meet new characters, another Cop, No. 663 (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) and Faye the waitress (Faye Wong). 663 has also gone through a rough breakup with an air hostess, but shows some interest in Faye. Faye comes into possession of a key to his apartment and starts going in and cleaning it and buying him new clothes. The two eventually meet but never get together.The film is overall very quirky, full of fantastic dialogue and acted brilliantly. The separate stories and repetition are confusing but the characters are so likable that it doesn't hurt the film. Shot on location, mostly with a hand held camera, the film immerses you in the streets of Hong Kong, a colourful, energetic crowded world. Wong Kar-Wai said of the film that he was trying to reconnect to the basics of cinema and the film definitely achieves that, essentially the film is just these idiosyncratic, emotional characters existing in a location. A very original film.",Chungking Express
170,preetharaghu,Best movie ever,10,7 April 2006,"Wong Kar Wai's international breakthrough is truly a marvellous piece of work. It is a story about lovelorn cops just trying to find love and connect with movie. A 20 year old Takeshi Kaneshiro stars as the pineapple eating cop 223 who has just broken up with his girlfriend and is crushed. He resorts to eating from 30 pineapple cans(because his girlfriend loves pineapples) in one night(the day before his birthday. He soon decides to fall in love with the first woman he meets in a bar and that woman (unknown to him) happens to be a drug dealer. Even though she is hesitant at first, they connect as two people just looking for a sense of belonging. The second story is more romantic but by no means overtly sweet. Its realistic. Waitress Faye Wong (who LOVES California dreaming by the mamas and the papas)falls hard for cop Tony Leung 663 and breaks into his apartment and basically acts as a housewife without him knowing! Whereas Tony Leung, still lamenting over losing his air hostess girlfriend is oblivious to this and talks to his objects and appliances at home. He finds what she is doing and asks her out. She leaves and goes to California but leaves him a letter. At the end though, she comes back after a year to see that he is in charge of where she used to work and they reach a sort of, perhaps, hopeful agreement. The reason i love this film is for the sheer madness and beauty portrayed. I used to live in hong Kong and knew where these scenes were shot(although i came on 1997). It was so wonderful to see a movie showing Hong Kong in its true light.In fact, it was after this movie that i took an interest in hk movies etc. The other reason i liked this film was because its the type of film that you can keep watching and discover each time something new. It has that sort of timeless quality in its message and visual showing Now time to review the actors. Takeshi Kaneshiro - in my opinion, one of the most beautiful men in the world. And he can actually act. I love the way he is able to shows his vulnerability and the need to love someone. He is hilarious in his telephone calls to his girlfriends family. He seems to me a very real character but also the most optimistic one and thats why i find him attractive. Briggite Lin - though we never see her real face (we only get a small glimpse after she takes off the wig and sunglasses), she is wonderful in terms of her body language her facial expressions. Tony Leung - i think he is wonderful. a truly deep character who suppresses all his emotions. Unlike Takeshi who is young and hopeful, tony is more a cynic and quiet. He shows his vulnerability too but also is very masculine in his representation of it. Faye Wong - great actress. love her cranberries tribute and it seemed SO suitable to the movie. Although i have explained the movie fully, it still doesn't do justice to when you watch it. I hope you enjoy Chungking Express as much as i did!",Chungking Express
171,fgh_imdb,"Beautiful,melancholic,well paced, cinematic marvel",9,8 May 2017,"Wong Kar Wai(WKW) is a cinematic genius. Chunkgking Express, a film highly regarded by many a critic, is a sheer marvel of the style WKW has coined and developed over the years. A mood piece that delves into the all too common human experiences of love, heartbreak, regret, and even the hidden strength of starting anew. The film is broken up into two parts that are parallel in structure and theme, but separated by time. The first part follows beat cop 223, a low-end cop who polices the streets of Hong Kong. This premise serves as a jumping off point to a brilliant look into the yearning of youth in the streets of HK.WKW uses visual imagery to punctuate these very visceral, lived-in experiences that reach a level of transcendence due to charm,love, and an extraordinary ability to connect with the audience. Let me be 100% transparent, I hold the WKW films of the early 90's- 2000's above all else. There is this frenetic style and charisma that burns all up and down his movies that make them unforgettable...The movie employs a clever, twin structure that adds slightly more complexity to the film; making two disjointed plots more nuanced than they would be separately.The second, lengthier half of the plot follows beat cop 663. Recently dumped by his girlfriend, struggling to pick up the pieces. WKW, essentially played it both ways. The first half has a slightly different tone; showing the underbelly of HK, which accentuates the rugged and frenetic pace. On the same token, the second half really hones in on two characters, develops their world, who they are, and how they connect.Ultimately, there is one thing that continually resonates with me about this film, and that being its vision. You do not see melancholy portrayed so beautifully, so captivatingly. Is this film a masterpiece? I don't know, but I have yet to see a film anything like this - which makes it all the more special.",Chungking Express
172,sgouros-61935,Significantly overrated,2,5 April 2021,"Two stories with no connection whatsoever. Uneven development between the two stories, uneven development between the main characters. No plot, no buildup. Attractive cast, excellent cinematography. It does flow quite nice as a movie, but 8.0 rating? You must be joking.",Chungking Express
173,bastidunne,A Movie Made of Liquid,8,23 April 2006,"I love this moviea movie made of liquid, watery or happy in the blur of a drunken dazeturn the Cranberries on, turn that song up, play it over and over again, it's hypnoticAll style and no substance? No, all style is all substance. In Chungqing Express, the style is the substance. The movie uses strange overlapping elements to create a dream-like quality, a quality which is connected to the liquidity of the lighting, the almost impressionistic images that make up this movie, images of 21st century Hong Kong that share something with those that Monet and Renoir and Manet painted of 19th century Paristhe overlapping elements include: two parallel story lines that come close and part in a seeming random way, the Cranberries song showing up in similar scenes.",Chungking Express
