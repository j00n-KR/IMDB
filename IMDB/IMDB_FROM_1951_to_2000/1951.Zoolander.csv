0,MartinHafer,Silly and good for a few laughs.,7,29 December 2016,"If you are looking for a cerebral comedy, you certainly should not pick ""Zoolander"". It's dumb, rather silly and...dumb. But, it's also good for a few laughs and is a very amiable time-passer filled with lots of amazing cameos.The film is about a narcissistic idiot male model, Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller). He's world famous but also quite empty-headed...so empty-headed that Mugatu* (Will Ferrell) is planning on brainwashing him into murdering the president of Malaysia. Why? Well, because Mugatu and the other evil fashion designers want to keep operating their sweatshops around the globe and the new leader of Malaysia is in favor of outlawing child labor! Fortunately, a writer for ""Time"", Matilda Jefferies (Christine Taylor**) is there to help uncover the plot and with the help of another really stupid male model (Owen Wilson) the three of them work to disrupt Mugatu's plans.I will freely admit that the plot is pretty shallow and nonsensical as well as the ending being a bit dumb. However, the film is still works quite well because it is still quite funny and pokes a lot of fun at the fashion/modeling industry. While it's not a hilarious, must-see comedy, it does the trick and makes you laugh. And, it's interesting to see the many, many, many cameos by the rich and famous (such as David Bowie, Donald Trump, Natalie Portman, Lenny Kravitz, Fabio, Gwen Stafani and many more) as well as a chance to see nepotism in action, as Ben Stiller's parents (Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara), his sister (Amy Stiller) and his wife (Taylor)!*Mugatu is the name of a nasty white ape-like monster from a Star Trek episode, ""A Private Little War"".**If Taylor looks familiar, you might just remember her as the actress who played Marcia in the fabulous ""Brady Bunch"" movies.",Zoolander
1,bkoganbing,Stiller Family Production,7,28 April 2012,"I see that another Zoolander film is in the works right now with Ben Stiller repeating his character of the brain dead male model. As it's been over a decade I hope that his character ages properly with the time. His career as the 'it' boy of the fashion industry should be over by now, but no reason he can't have a son breaking into the business.And what a business it is. Zoolander is a film with the premise that male models as a rule are so impossibly dumb and so vain about their looks that they are the most manipulatable people on the planet. And when you've got them being trained as assassins as fashion mogul Will Ferrell is doing, you've got the basis of some pretty good comedy.The lines in Zoolander aren't really that important, this is a character driven comedy and you'll take away Ben Stiller's character of Derek Zoolander, kid from the coal mining area of South Jersey who got out of that environment and made it to the top of his profession. But a new, equally gorgeous and equally dumb Owen Wilson starts threatening the king and beats him as he goes for a fourth crown as male model of the year.Ty Cobb when he went for tenth straight batting championship and lost to Tris Speaker never went through such soul searching as Ben Stiller does her. If he can't be the prettiest face, time to agonizingly reappraise your life. It's then when he gets signed by Will Ferrell and tricked into his brainwashed assassin's school.Now why do you think they want the Prime Minister of Malaysia killed. It's because he's standing up for the workers in the Asian sweatshops that turn out all the designer clothes that the beautiful people wear, actually wanting them to be paid a living wage. Got a kill a radical like that.And speaking of beautiful people an array of celebrities both play themselves and have small bit roles in the film. That includes Ben Stiller's mother Anne Meara on in the blink of an eye as an animal rights protester. Milla Jovavich has a nice turn as a beautiful assassin and Ferrell's chief killing aide. So does Christine Taylor as both investigative reporter and good girl who get 'sandwiched' between hunks Stiller and Wilson. Although Zoolander's gags occasionally fall flat i think most people will get a portion of laughs of all kinds at Ben Stiller's and Owen Wilson marvelous characters.",Zoolander
2,SnoopyStyle,A few big laughs,6,25 August 2014,"There is a new Prime Minister in Malaysia and the fashion industry wants to fight back against his humane minimum wage. They tell fashion designer Mugatu (Will Ferrell) to take care of him during fashion week in NYC. He just needs to brainwash an empty-headed male model idiot into killing the Prime Minister. After an embarrassing defeat to Hansel (Owen Wilson), Mugatu tells manager Maury Ballstein (Jerry Stiller) that Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) needs to be that idiot. Meanwhile Matilda Jeffries (Christine Taylor) tries to write a story on Zoolander.It is the stupidest of stupid and silliest of silly. It definitely has its insane laughs. The best has to be the self wedgie in the walk off. However it doesn't all work. The jokes don't all pay off. The obvious comparison is to 'Dumb and Dumber'. What's missing from this movie is a comedy partner for Ben Stiller. This would be much funnier if Zoolander has a partner that is just as dumb. Quite frankly, Owen Wilson isn't dumb enough.",Zoolander
3,Prismark10,The look,5,17 September 2013,"Ben Stiller stars, directs and co writes the movie.Zoolander is a dim witted supermodel that becomes a pawn in a plot to assassinate the Prime Minister of Malaysia by corrupt fashion executives one of them played by Will Ferrell, who wants to retain cheap labour.At the beginning of the film we see Derek Zoolander being ousted as the top male fashion model by the rising star, Hansel McDonald played by Owen Wilson.His reputation is further diminished by a critical article from journalist Matilda Jeffries played by Christine Taylor.Zoolander retires from modelling rejoins his family in the coal mines but Derek is not cut out to be a miner and he later accepts Ferrell's offer to appear in his next fashion show.The film is silly but the genial good nature of both Stiller and Wilson carry it through.The absurdity of the plot sort of keeps things ticking over. The film was not a big office success but seemed to have found an audience in later years via TV and DVD.It may not be laugh out funny, supermodels are of course an easy target but it did make me consistently chuckle and there is a good soundtrack as well.",Zoolander
4,kosmasp,Fashion never goes out of style,7,12 June 2016,"Or does it? Some may think that is the case with the sequel, especially considering the voting it received here at IMDb. But let's stick with the original, that paved the way and/or elevated the career of those involved. The comedy trio in this do a great job selling their actually ridiculous roles and ""looks"".And by looks most do know what I mean, even if they haven't seen the movies. Zoolander and his facial expressions can almost be described as epic. As well as completely and utterly bad. If we would be talking about a quality or a class if you want to call it that, this movie would be slide ride under it. So lower your standards and enjoy a well executed and funny ride",Zoolander
5,gavin6942,One of the More Tolerable Ben Stiller Films,6,25 January 2008,"Derek Zoolander is an international model-slash-actor. But his life has taken a tragic turn: he loses an award to new superstar Hansel, his friends die in a horrible gasoline accident and he is ready to quit the business. Things seemingly turn around when he is offered a job as the face of the new Derelicte clothing line, but his handler has more sinister intentions.I'm not particularly a fan of Ben Stiller or his films. He's often annoying and not very funny... and not even particularly handsome. He is a better background figure (""Happy Gilmore"") than a lead (""Something About Mary""). So why does this film entertain me? I'll tell you: the celebrity cameos. We have some great co-stars (Christine Taylor is awesome and sexy, and Will Ferrell has one of the best roles of his career here).What sold it for me (besides Farrell) was the Billy Zane cameo. Sure, Lance Bass and Fred Durst were funny. Natalie Portman is hot. And David Bowie does the best David Bowie impression on earth. But Zane sold the film when Owen Wilson said, ""You should listen to your friend Billy Zane. He's a cool dude."" That was the funniest line in the film (but so true).In all fairness, Stiller is better here than in other films. And there are plenty of memorable scenes -- the gasoline accident scene takes the cake, with perfect music playing (Wham!) and everything looking just right. I also really enjoy the trance sequence -- one of Ferrell's best scenes ever filmed.As far as Ferrell-Stiller-Wilson movies go, this one isn't at the top of the pile, but it's clearly above the halfway mark. Even non-fans will find something they like and I guarantee a few laughs along the way. My second viewing was more enjoyable than my first and I suspect this is a trend that grows with subsequent viewings.",Zoolander
6,lee_eisenberg,"A ""model"" comedy!",10,21 October 2005,"Ever imagined a movie whose outlandish premise seems to good to be true? Well, ""Zoolander"" is one such movie. Airhead male model Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller, who also wrote and directed the movie) is brainwashed to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia. Yes, that's the plot; and they do a great job with it.One of the best things about this movie is that it shows how not only are these models dumb as rocks, but they're often not that good-looking. I think that no one else could have done it as well as Ben Stiller and the ensemble cast that he assembled (Christine Taylor, Owen Wilson, Will Ferrell, Milla Jovovich, David Duchovny, and a WHOLE BUNCH of other people). This is the ultimate example of a comedy classic. Perfect.",Zoolander
7,jboothmillard,Zoolander,7,30 November 2008,"Written and directed by, and starring Ben Stiller, I knew this film was about modelling, and it turned out to be a pretty funny film. Basically Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) is the three time VH1 male model of the year, and he looks forward to the fourth, but is beaten by rival Hansel (Owen Wilson). So Derek's friends disappear, his father Larry (Jon Voight) is disappointed in him, and feels like he's not a good model anymore. But he soon gets hired by the fiendish fashion guru Mugatu (Will Ferrell), only to be brainwashed into killing the President of Malaysia, and many other models have something implanted in them. Time Magazine journalist Matilda Jeffries (Christine Taylor) is now trying to help Derek hide out from the Katinka (Milla Jovovich) and the other bad guys, and find a way to stop the brainwashing murder from happening. Also starring Jerry Stiller (Ben's father) as Maury Ballstein, David Duchovny as J.P. Prewitt, Judah Friedlander as Scrappy Zoolander, Nathan Lee Graham as Todd, Alexandre Manning as Brint, Asio Highsmith as Rufus and Alexander Skarsgård (Stellan's son) as Meekus, with cameos from Donald Trump, Christian Slater, Cuba Gooding Jr., Natalie Portman, Fabio, Lenny Kravitz, Gwen Stefani, Heidi Klum, Mark Ronson, Paris Hilton, David Bowie, Kimberly 'Lil' Kim' Jones, Claudia Schiffer, Lukas Haas, Amy Stiller (Ben's sister) as Hansel's Posse Member, Jennifer Coolidge as American Designer, X-Men's James Marsden as John Wilkes Booth, Victoria Beckham, The King of Comedy's Sandra Bernhard, Emma Bunton, Blade's Stephen Dorff, Winona Ryder, Vince Vaughn as Luke Zoolander and Billy Zane. Stiller is good at playing both stupid and Hissy fits (he won an award from it funnily enough), and pulling those ""pose"" faces, and it is good to see so many famous faces in a satirical comedy film like this. Very good!",Zoolander
8,ccthemovieman-1,Funny For Those Who Like Absurd Humor,8,19 July 2007,"This has to be a movie that people would either laugh their butt off watching, or turn it off and never finishing it because it was so stupid. Fortunately, as someone who loves absurd humor, I was entertained by it. Yes, it's one of the dumbest films you'll ever see, but it's supposed to be stupid, a satire on the shallow people and world of male fashion models.Ben Stiller is outstanding as ""Derek Zoolander,"" the brainless model who's number one male model status is upended by newcomer ""Hansel,"" played by Owen Wilson. In light of Wilson's recent real-life drug problems, I couldn't help but think ""how can these actors play absurd roles like this and be normal?"" It's almost understandable by so many in the film business are whacked! You have to hand it to them, though: Stiller, Wilson, Millo Jovovich and Will Ferrell are good at playing weird people, as they do here. But it's all in fun - plus a serious comment about child labor - and the movie is simply to be enjoyed for what it is. Of course, it's stupid overall, but it's a spoof, like the Austin Powers films.Film fans and celebrity geeks will enjoy all the cameos in here, along with the wild outfits - male and female - and all the goofy looks on the faces, mainly Stiller's poses. In between all the dumbness is some smart satire on several topics dealing with the fashion business. Just know what you are getting into here, and you should get enough laughs to make it an entertaining hour-and-a-half.",Zoolander
9,dbdumonteil,the last of the famous international top-models,2,26 September 2004,"The story of this Ben Stiller's effort ranks among the ones that American cinema particularly has a liking for. The flawless career of a fellow at first unlikely to succeed his life but who, ultimately will have become rich, respectable and will have found his place in society. Stiller must have been influenced by this kind of story for his work. He acts Derek Zoolander, an eccentric young man who could have spent his life in poverty due to his limited intellectual faculties. But, fortunately, the world of fashion rescued him and he became a seasoned top-model. I must admit that I'm not fond of this kind of topic, very simply because it seems unlikely to me. A topic like this one prevents a movie from working well. I will attribute without any hesitation, my opinion to Stiller's movie. The absence of directing is to deplore as well as his execrable performance. By his grimaces, the way he talks, he tries to ape Jim Carrey with a much less convincing result which gives ludicrous sequences. Moreover, with ""Zoolander"", Stiller's intention was to shot a satire of the world of fashion; but this point is flown over than denounced. Sorry, Mr Stiller you missed your chance. At last, it is not a labored and inconsistent screenplay that will make up the whole. I used the term ""inconsistent"" because Stiller acts a so dumb character that it is nearly impossible to imagine him running a center for children who want to learn to read.Ultimately, it is a humorous piece with ponderous humor. If Ben Stiller proved himself as an actor (although ""Zoolander"" doesn't belong to his major opus), he still has serious improvement to do at the level of directing. Really, the year 2001 wasn't a good one for American comedies. Only, Wes Anderson played his game well with the witty ""the Royal Tenenbaums"" that year...",Zoolander
10,blanche-2,rolling in the aisles,7,12 February 2003,"This is one of those movies you either get the sensibility of or you just don't. I was laughing out loud so that will tell you where I am. Zoolander is an elaborate skit peppered with music videos and it's hysterical. I love the against type casting of Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson as supermodels and all the cameos are fun. The premise is very funny, as is the total send-up of the modeling business. This is the kind of frothy, mind candy entertainment that we all need once in a while. Take it on that level and you won't be disappointed. The first part of the movie is the funniest; it falls apart later on and then just becomes stupid. Recommended if you're feeling silly and the thought of Ben Stiller as a model makes you laugh.",Zoolander
11,Quinoa1984,"When it's funny, it's funny. When it's stupid th, it's ludicrous",8,29 September 2001,"But still, I have a good feeling about Ben Stiller's Zoolander, even though I can't reccomend it as much as other Stiller comedies (Meet the Parents, Something About Mary, The Cable Guy which he directed).  It has Stiller as a near brain dead male model named, you guessed it, Derek Zoolander.  As he is trying to find his roots and try to find another outlet other than the male modeling world, he is unknowingly (of course) put into a plot to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia.There are some really funny scenes contained in the movie (the best is seeing a spoof of 2001 as Stiller and Wilson band away at a computer trying to trun it on) and while they don't add up to make a total funny comedy, it is stupid fun.  Just make sure to go in the theater with a clear head (and don't follow Ebert's review).  Many stars make various cameos including David Bowie, Jon Voight, Billy Zane and others, yet it is Jerry Stiller, Ben's father, who steals some scenes as a manager.  B-",Zoolander
12,sunwarrior13,Delivers Fun And Laughter,8,9 November 2016,"Comedian Ben Stiller writes,directs and stars in this film that spoofs the fashion industry entitled Zoolander.The story involves a a fashion executive Derek Zoolander.Owen Wilson and Will Ferrell co- star. The name ""Derek Zoolander"" was inspired by names of two male models who both worked for Calvin Klein. The story has the intellectually challenged Zoolander becoming a pawn of corrupt fashion executives that are planning to kill the Malaysian Prime Minister after he finds himself being eclipsed in popularity by his rival named Hansel.It was definitely one would consider a dumb comedy that consists of a weak plot and several one-dimensional characters.But great comedic performances from Stiller,Wilson and Ferrell definitely provide tons of fun and laughter in spite the things mentioned previously.",Zoolander
13,Theo Robertson,What Is This Crap About ?,3,15 June 2003,"I normally like Ben Stiller but I think with ZOOLANDER he has too many irons in too many fires . Directed by , written by and starring Ben Stiller proves you can have too much of a good thing . Stiller works best when he`s playing it straight in a comic situation like THERE`S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY and MEET THE PARENTS  , but here he`s vainly trying to be funny and ends up being silly . The script might have worked if it just concentrated on male models ( Himbos ? Bimboys ? ) being pretentious with lines like "" Of course models help people . We make them feel good about themselves and show them how to do their hair "" . Even if it had stayed on the subplot about Derek Zoolander returning to his roots at the mining town the script might have had some saving graces , but no it suddenly turns into THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE where it loses all credibility and entertainment value .To see how satire on the male model industry works catch Sacha Baron Cohen`s ALI G IN DA USA where he plays a gay Austrian male model",Zoolander
14,preppy-3,Pretty funny,7,19 February 2003,"A very stupid male model, Zoolander (Ben Stiller) tries to find meaning in his life while fighting a rival male model (Owen Wilson) and unwittingly being used by an evil fashion designer (Will Ferrell).The jokes are funny--sometimes very funny. The movie really zips along and there are tons of in jokes and countless cameos by celebrities (my favorites were Winona Ryder and Billy Zane). Also Stiller and Wilson are hilarious--but seeing them as top male models is a stretch (then again, that might be part of the joke). Also Milla Jovovich is VERY weird--and funny.But Ferrell is annoying and not funny at all; Christine Taylor (Stillers real life wife) is beautiful but bland; Jerry Stiller and Jon Voight act like they're drugged and there just isn't enough material for a full length movie.Still, there are enough funny moments to make this worth a look.",Zoolander
15,utgard14,"Stupid...and Not 'Funny' Stupid, Either",4,12 July 2003,"Vanity project for Ben Stiller, one of my least favorite comedic actors of all time. Stiller has one joke and that one joke is a facial expression. That should tell you where he'll rank in the pantheon of comic greats. Owen Wilson and Will Ferrell aren't much better. Oh and there's a ton of celebrity cameos because...that's comedy now, I guess? Obviously I'm in the minority as a lot of people seem to love this. If you've never seen smug celebrities being smug or Ben's one joke before, then please watch this movie. I, however, would rather stab myself in the neck with a screwdriver than watch this dung again. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.",Zoolander
16,Boba_Fett1138,More lame than funny really.,5,3 August 2005,"I like Ben Stiller but seriously he should stop directing movies. The directing is really the weakest element of the movie and almost kills the fun entirely. Stiller also seems to be seriously obsessed with getting as many pointless close-ups of his wife Christine Taylor as possible. I mean she sure is pretty and all but it just gets distracting and annoying after a while.This is one of those movies that has hits and misses and when it hits, it doesn't hit hard. The humor is kind of lame and too over-the-top to be funny. This humor works for, as for instance Austin Powers but not for Derek Zoolander unfortunately. The movie never really becomes really funny, this is also due to the totally ridicules story.Still the movie makes some good fun of the modeling world at times and the small cameo's by the many famous people also makes this movie still somewhat entertaining to watch.The acting of especially the main characters played by Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson is good and is probably what prevents this movie from a completely unfunny and unwatchable one. All the characters are good and funny but unfortunately the script and directing is awful, so they don't get an awful lot to do in the movie.You are better of watching a different Ben Stiller movie, or an Austin Powers movie if you like silly modern humor.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Zoolander
17,view_and_review,"Don't read a ""ugugoly"" on this movie just yet",7,6 July 2007,"""Zoolander"" is probably Ben Stiller's silliest endeavor. I found it quite amusing, but its silliness did get to me at times. It's an enjoyable movie in a juvenile, sophomoric kind of way. You obviously can't take Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller), or any of his male model friends, seriously. And you especially can't take Hansel (Owen Wilson) seriously when you're staring at that huge sniffer on his face.It is a fun movie with a fair amount of laughable parts. Will Farrell does an excellent job as Mugato and David Duchovny's cameo is very amusing. Don't expect much from this movie in terms of plot or logic and you can have yourself a good time.",Zoolander
18,ferguson-6,Not the Magnum flop I expected,6,5 January 2003,"Greetings again from the darkness.  I put off seeing this for almost 2 years but agreed to watch when my son rented it.  Surprisingly, there were plenty of laughs to keep me watching.  However, I must say that Mr. Stiller's talents appear to be writing and acting - not directing.  5 years since ""The Cable Guy"" and he still just doesn't have the feel of a big time director. Always enjoyable to see father and son work together (Ben & Jerry) and Owen Wilson pulls off the male model role thanks to his natural quirkiness.  Most enjoyed watching Christine Taylor (""the Wedding Singer""), but thought Wil Ferrell had WAY too much screen time.  An almost unrecognizable Milla Jovovich was interesting, and Vince Vaughn in a non-speaking role had me cracking up.  Jon Voight proved again why he doesn't work much these days, and David Duchovny sheds all pride for a funny turn as a hand model informant.  Comedy is tough, so I will tip my cap to Ben for keeping me for the entire movie, so I say ""Relax"" and enjoy this for what it is.",Zoolander
19,anaconda-40658,The New Austin Powers.,7,26 November 2015,"Zoolander (2001): Dir: Ben Stiller / Cast: Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Christine Taylor, Will Ferrell, Milla Jovovich: Ben Stiller plays supermodel Derek Zoolander who is the best in the business with his latest fashion called Magnum. He is on top of his game until Hanszel wins male model of the year. Now they are engaged in a bitter feud, which involves a competition where they both yank their underwear out of their pants. Enter Christine Taylor who is attempting to uncover an assassination plot where male models are brainwashed into committing the crime. This all climaxes with extreme stupidity but Stiller succeeds in creating a film that is far different than his Reality Bites with obvious inspiration of Austin Powers. It is obvious that he researched his subject matter and took aim at the sometimes pompus world of the fame seeking. Stiller as Zoolander seeks appreciation from his father as well as retain his public dignity. Owen Wilson steals his spotlight as Hanszel. Taylor is a mere prop with hinted romantic intentions. Will Ferrell is hilarious as the villain with outrageous hair. Milla Jovovich plays Ferrell's evil henchwoman, which is just as well since she has done the Resident Evil films. The climax is sidelined by numbing violence meant for humor but is merely just corny. Good concept satires the world of modeling with colorful production but it still wallows in stupidity.

20,FlashCallahan,They're Breakdance fighting.....,8,10 July 2014,"Male supermodel Derek Zoolander is on the way down after three years of continuously winning the ""Male Model of the Year"" award. When he is beaten by the hot newcomer Hansel, Derek starts searching for a new meaning in his life. Fashion czar Mugatu offers Derek a comeback in his new ""Derelicte""- line. Nobody suspects that Mugatu plans to assassinate the new Malaysian Prime Minister on his visit to New York, so that cheap child labour is still available for Mugatu's fashion producing. By brainwashing Zoolander, Mugatu and his associates create a willing killer to do the job. By Lampooning the brilliant Manchiurian candidate, Stiller here has made his finest film to date. The film is that brilliant, that, apart from Dodgeball, every film he's been in has been hugely disappointing. And it doesn't help either that he's been promising a sequel to this for years.Why is it so brilliant? Stiller isn't the best looking person in the world, but he convinces as Zoolander, he and Wilson convince as supermodels, and it just makes a mockery of the fashion world.Do the many cameos of the fashion world not know that this film is contradicting everything a supermodel stands for? And it all starts with his face....The cast are brilliant, the cameos are surreal and hilarious, and Ferrell is brilliant as Mugatu.It has a strong similarity to the 60's movie Danger: Diabolik, but it doesn't rip the film off, it just pleasantly homages the film.It's still pretty fresh after nearly 13 years, but Stiller could be a one trick pony.His other films are pretty lame.",Zoolander
21,Sylviastel,Spoofing the Model World!,6,15 January 2008,"Ben Stiller takes the crack at spoofing the model world in this film version where he plays Derek Zoolander, one of the top male models. Owen Wilson also plays his rival. Derek's not bright at all and it should come as no surprise. Will Ferrell has a supporting role as the man who is set to kill the prime minister of Malaysia using a brainwashed Zoolander. Anyway, it's reminiscent of the Manchurian Candidate. Christine Taylor from the Brady Bunch films and Wedding Singer, plays a reporter. She really is quite identical to Maureen McCormick and could be her daughter. Ben's dad, Jerry Stiller, is also in the film as manager Holstein and his mother, Anne Meara, has a cameo. It's quite hilarious at times and downright silly. Jon Voigt plays Derek's hard-working blue collar father who is ashamed of his son's chosen career.",Zoolander

I guess that makes this movie a 4.  Anyways, I love the part where he says, ""how do you expect kids to learn in a school that small"" is funny. The change in music at the fashion show is funny, in a stupid way.  Very 80's, a good decade for high tech style.",Zoolander
23,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Zoolander,7,16 February 2006,"I am five years late. Just as I was so prepared to watch a Ben Stiller caper, with the posters all up at local theaters, the movie disappeared from the radar, and was banned in Singapore. Why? Because the plot was about a fashion model being brainwashed ala The Manchurian Candidate to assassinate the Malaysian Prime Minister.Why? Because Malaysia was being used as a sweatshop that hires child labor to manufacture cheap garments created by the western fashion houses, and they are not happy that the PM has outlawed working children. Hence the insane sounding plot right in the beginning. However, someone forgot to tell Ben that the Malaysian footage didn't look like Malaysia, but more like Tiananmen Square. Where got wave banners like that? Got space meh? But since we're friendly neighbors of Malaysia, when they banned it, we banned it too, to show solidarity.Anyway, for refusing to watch illegal downloaded copies, I was finally rewarded when GV decided to screen it here (no more ban? why now?) for a limited period, even though I suspect since it's a Village Roadshow production, why let it collect dust in the archives? Ben Stiller co-created and plays Derek Zoolander, male model of the year 3 times in a row, with that killer Blue Steel look - an anal retentive look which actually seduces and is popular with the crowd. As most would already know, this comedy parodies almost everything about the fashion industry, like how himbotic male models can be, and amplified that dumbness more than 100%. Zoolander loses his crown to up and coming male model Hansel (played by Owen Wilson with long flowing locks, surfer dude style), and decides to retire.But since the chief villain and fashion guru Mugatu (Will Ferrell) requires a dim-witted model to be his assassin (they have buff muscular bodies, and listen to instructions), his assistant Katinka (Milla Jovovich, yummy) brings Zoolander to a secret day spa to be brainwashed, and ready to be a killing machine during the opening of the Derelicte line of clothes.Real life Mrs Stiller Christine Taylor plays Matilda, a nosy journalist who tails Zoolander to try and get to Mugatu, and gets entangled in the assassination plot. But don't worry, the storyline isn't as complex as I've described. It's filled with plenty of insane subplots and scenes, like Zoolander's retirement decision to join his dad and brother (Jon Voight, and an uncredited Vince Vaughn, who doesn't speak a word), an orgy of sorts with dwarfs, and even a walk-off competition between Zoolander and Hansel, with closure that comes straight out of Stephen Chow's campy movies.The real scream actually comes from the dozens of cameo appearances of the who's-who in the fashion and entertainment industry. Just as a flavor, there's Karl Lagerfield, Donald Trump, Tom Ford, Natalie Portman (who declares her love for Zoolander), Winona Ryder (who tries to seduce Zoolander), Gwen Stefani, Heidi Klum, Fabio, Fred Durst, Paris Hilton (!), Victoria Beckham, and even Billy Zane. You can refer to IMDb to get the entire list of credited and uncredited appearances. But what's the icing on the cake is David Duchovny's role as an X-File-ish character straight from his Fox Mulder days. Simply brought back the memories, in a funny way, including the many 80s and 90s pop music injected into the movie.So for those who have held out to finally experience Zoolander's new Magnum look, this is your chance. The movie might be dated, but it sure doesn't feel that way. Great fun.",Zoolander
24,namashi_1,A Genuine Slap-Stick Entertainer!,7,17 November 2011,"Stationery Warning: 'Zoolander' is NOT meant for the Pseudo Intellulectuals nor is it for those who prefer black-comedies. 'Zoolander' is non-stop, non-sense, yet funny & lively. Sure, it's not laugh-out-loud funny, but it hits the right points on more than one or two occasions. 'Zoolander' Synopsis: At the end of his career, a clueless fashion model is brainwashed to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia.Late Drake Sather, John Hamburg & Ben Stiller's Screenplay is wild, funny & nuts. The characters, the situations, the entire execution, everything is either over-the-top or completely zany. Yet, it raises the correct amount of hilarious moments, that make this one a genuine slap-stick entertainer. Stiller's Direction, on the other-hand, is fast. Cinematography, Editing & Art Design, are appropriate. Costume Design, is quite good. Performance-Wise: Stiller is superb as Zoolander. He plays the dimwitted model, with great energy. Christine Taylor supports well. Owen Wilson is astonishing as Zoolander's opposition. He brings the house down with his impeccable comic-timing. Will Ferrell is funnily menacing. Milla Jovovich is perfect. Jon Voight & David Duchovny are memorable in brief roles. Others lend good support. On the whole, 'Zoolander' has, and will always, appeal to those, who relish slap-stick comedies.",Zoolander
25,Smells_Like_Cheese,"""Don't you think there is more to this life than being really, really, really, ridiculously good looking?""",9,29 November 2003,"""Zoolander"" is a hysterical movie that has non-stop laughs and endless memorable quotes. I'm not kidding when everyone had told me that ""Zoolander"" was one of the funniest movies they'd ever seen, so I had to give it a chance. I'm really glad I did.Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson give a parody on male super models that is beyond tears of laughter. Ben Stiller plays ""Derek Zoolander"", a 3 time ""Male Model of the Year"" award winner, when his streak of wins is stopped by Owen's character, Hansel, he starts to doubt his career and wants to go back home with his father and brothers as a mine worker. He pretty much fails due to the lack of his being used to high maintenance type of environment with clear air and less, well, work. When his father tells him that he's no longer part of the family, Ben gets the offer of his career or so he thinks. Will Ferrel plays Mogotu, an evil model agency owner who is trying to kill the prime minister of Molesia so he can continue to have children make his clothes. He figures people would assume that Derrek has lost it with his career so he can easily frame him and brainwash him into killing the prime minister for him. When a journalist played by Ben Stiller's wife, Christine Taylor, Matilda finds out about this, she tries to save Derrek by hiding him ""where no one would know he's there"", hence at Hansel's house. Hansel is very forgiving and confesses that he was wack and Derrek was his inspiration to be a model and Derrek claims his wack of being jealous. There they have strong tea and learn of the lacking in Matilda's love life and why she hates models. Hansel playfully says ""I think we should get naked... don't talk, just give into the power of the tea"". Followed by a very strange but amusing orgy where Derrek just happens to fall for Matilda. But Derrek will NOT miss a show and there is a certain ""relax""ing music that will cause him to kill the prime minister of Molesia! Can he make it past the beautiful celebrities and save the day? Ben, Owen, Will, and Christine work perfectly together in this great comedy about male super models. This movie has non stop laughs and you'll immediately buy it when you see it. If you can't laugh at this movie and it's amazing rounds of cameo's, I don't know what's wrong, because this movie doesn't deserve to be under a 7.0. Trust me, this is a great movie!9/10",Zoolander

Ben Stiller in the company of his parents and a whole bunch of miscellaneous celebs in bit parts, plays an empty-headed and narcissistic top male fashion model, Derek Zoolander,  who is topped by an even topper male fashion model played by Owen (the nose) Wilson. Yeah, Stiller and Wilson playing fashion models: Funny premise, huh? With a kind of 007 (that's Zoolander's IQ) assassination plot thing going on, brainwashing Zoolander (no detergent required), a runway  ""walk-off"" and other nonsense, this flick bulges with stupid, silly, nonsensical humor. Depending on -your- sense of humor, this film may wear itself out early or leave you craving seconds. Most will find LOL's aplenty with one helping sufficient.",Zoolander
27,MovieAddict2016,"What happened, Ben?",6,18 August 2002,"I think Ben Stiller is usually quite funny, especially in Meet the Parents (update as of 12/04: his shtick is now growing weary), but Zoolander is one of his worst. There are few funny moments that I actually laughed at. Even though Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller are best buds and frequently work together in films, it didn't help the rest of the movie at all. The female love interest of Derek Zoolander lacked charisma, and though Ben's real life dad Jerry Stiller (Seinfeld) was in this, he couldn't save it either.Zoolander is a huge misfire because it tries to target a specific age group and, I think, fails mostly due to the fact that it's not nearly as funny as it thinks it is. Sure, it has a few funny cameos from the likes of Billy Zane, David Duchovny and Will Ferrell, and there are a few funny one-liners including ""How are the children supposed to learn to read if they can't even fit inside the building?"", but if you've already seen the trailer...you've seen the best bits.2.5/5",Zoolander
28,KineticSeoul,I personally think this is a classic comedy,9,8 February 2016,"This is actually a very clever and smartly executed comedy revolving around dumb characters. I just found this film to be amusing and I had a smirking or chuckling most of the way through the first time I saw it. Ben Still is actually really good at making these comedic movies. So the movie is revolves around a very exaggerated male modeling. With most of the humor coming from mocking models and the modeling career. How models are dumb and so superficial, which can actually offend some real models out there if they don't have a sense of humor about it. But than again, there are plenty of movies that bash on handicap people and overweight people. Where it has that it's funny cause he or she is fat kind of ordeal. But in this, it's funny cause he is so dumb and lack common sense type of humor. Which has been done many times before as well. However the way the humor connects so well with each scenario is what makes this movie really work as a comedy.

31,paul2001sw-1,"This is not Spinal Tap, more like Dumb and Dumber",7,19 October 2005,"Ben Stiller's 'Zoolander' is supposedly a stinging satire on the world of fashion. But the picture is creates is so over the top, and the plot so exaggeratedly stupid, that it fails to hit any real targets: there's also an extremely large quantity of product placement to endure. However, while it might not be satire, it is full of a great string of gags about stupid people. The truth is that many of these are just damn funny, and in a comedy, that's arguably the most important thing. As a director, Stiller is no genius, and there are some clunky moments with the camera-work and music; and the acting (of Stiller and others) is also pretty basic.

32,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Essentially just one long joke: our hero is stupid.,6,19 October 2018,"'Zoolander (2001)' has its fair share of funny moments but it's essentially just one long, sort of uninspired joke: our protagonist is a male model and is 'therefore' stupid. That's not to say that the two identifiers are intrinsically linked, rather that the film seems to tie them together - perhaps unwittingly - in a way that almost seems mean-spirited, or at least approaching that. This is through omission as opposed to inclusion, necessarily, but it still stands out as an issue considering that every male model character is also portrayed as, shall we say, less than intelligent. This definitely becomes played-out pretty quickly considering that the gags all stem from this, the film's apparent core principle and, as I mentioned, only real, reoccurring joke (or at least the basis for it). Neither of the main issues I've mentioned, not the near mean-spirit nor lack of innovation, are helped by the fact that the main supporting player is portrayed as being just as comically ""bone-headed"" as our hero; this doesn't provide a good foil for (or contrast to) our lead and it definitely doesn't help with the film's stereotyping problem. It's not like there isn't any enjoyment to be had and, like I mentioned, there are a few laughs here and there. However, a lack of originality does seep in pretty quickly and the picture isn't all that compelling in general. 6/10",Zoolander

The conspiracy theory stuff drags the film down in a stale second half, and gags about things like bulimia just aren't funny. The film is chock-full of cameos, many of which are cool (David Bowie, Wynona Ryder, Natalie Portman, David Duchovny, Alexander Skarsgard), others of which are nauseating (Donald Trump, Jon Voight).

I heard so many good things about it and I'm a big fan of both Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller, but in a way I was disappointed. I thought that I would be giving this movie a ten but I deserves a seven at max.This is about a fashion mogul Derek Zoolander who is being brainwashed so he could assassinate the President of Malaysia.The acting is good but not great. I was kind of annoyed at Ben Stiller's accent in the movie. I did enjoy the performances by Owen Wilson and Will Ferrell though.I thought this movie would have me cracking up during the whole movie but it did not. It still had plenty of big laughs though. I just loved the whole beginning at the awards show.Overall, this is a decent but flawed movie. I'm skeptical over the upcoming Zoolander sequel(if it's ever made). I rate this film 7/10.",Zoolander
35,lesleyharris30,"Good Comedy with a Great Cast, though it's far too Flamboyant,",7,2 July 2012,"Zoolander is a good movie with a well written storyline and a terrific comedic cast. It's jam packed with a stellar cast, memorable quotes and some terrific celebrity cameos, Ben Stiller is the highlight as he throws away that awkward guy persona we are use to seeing him playing and becomes a cocky fashion model who struggles with a loss of fame, he also has terrific chemistry with his real life friends Owen Wilson and Will Ferrell. As a comedy, it tries a bit too hard to be weird, flamboyant and stand out, I feel like Stiller geared towards the Austin Powers movies when making this, but the craziness is not half as classy, it felt like they were trying too hard, especially the scenes where Mugatu brainwashes Zoolander, the car wash and the battle at the end. I also found that it focused too much on Derek, I understand that he's the protagonist, but it is so dedicated to this character that the rest feel underdeveloped, we learn very little about Hansel, Matilda is a very two dimensional love interest and Mugatu's intentions are never made entirely clear. It's not my favourite comedy that the Frat Pack has brought us, but Zoolander is still a lot of innocent fun, worth the watch if you're looking for a good comedy and see it on television or Netflix. As a fashion model enters the end of his career, he is brainwashed to kill the governor of Malaysia by the head of a rival fashion company. Best Performance: Ben Stiller",Zoolander
36,secondtake,It's so awful it's terrific. At times. Funny and star studded.,7,9 November 2013,"Zoolander (2001)A preposterous and often hilarious (and often very goofy) comedy set in the world of high fashion. And international politics, kind of.Ben Stiller is the title character, and he's so affected and ""stupid"" he's perfectly funny. Even when he makes the same move with his head, pursing his lips and looking blankly across the room, over and over, it's funny. Every time. He has to deal with being exceedingly stupid, vain, good looking, and now, suddenly, unsuccessful.He loses his ""crown"" as best model to Hansel, played by Owen Wilson. He also manages to very be funny, though less by acting and more by having an absurd role —new hippie hedonist. As supermodel. Okay, whatever!There is an extremely dull if pretty reporter who is looking into this fashion world, especially a bizarre Mugatu character played by Will Ferrell. Evil ensues. David Bowie shows up for a contest. A whole slew of actual fashion names lend themselves for cameos. It's a rollicking movie. It even makes a little sense, which is good because it doesn't need to, and we want the resolution to happen.And oh yeah—you get to relax to Frankie Goes to Hollywood, the perfect empty hyped up pre-techno dance studio bland band, which has a key role, via vinyl. Milla Jovovich has a small role that's a little like Uma in ""Kill Bill"" and her name is worth the ride: Katinka Ingabogovinanana. Look for little appearances by big names: Christian SLater, Donald Trump, Jon Voight, Natalie Portman, Paris Hilton (duh, yeah!) and Heidi Klum (her too), Fabio, Lenny Kravitz, K-Roc, Richie Rich, Billy Zane, Vince Vaughn, and so on!

I was enjoying it and I was laughing, I wouldn't call it a favorite or fantastic movie. I would actually just call it a movie to watch if you need a laugh or just plain bored!It was very surprising to see some of Ben Stillers family members including his wife Christine Taylor playing his love interest in the movie. She is gorgeous and I honestly think Ben Stiller definitely doesn't look like his father, Jerry Stiller. You wouldn't think they are father/son team. You would think they are just plain random actors acting together! Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller honestly make a great team but without the fake 'cool' accents and mention sexual jokes made the movie a bit distasteful. Especially the threesome scene made me cringe even though I know it's comedy! I think if they just be themselves and less sex jokes, they would've got a 9 or 10 star rating for this movie!

39,ironhorse_iv,Zoolander was ridiculously good-looking. A must-watch comedy.,7,19 November 2015,"Who would have thought that a stupid comedy about a clueless fashion model, being brainwashed to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia would be so hilarious!? Who would had thought, that years later, that film would be popular enough to get garter a sequel? Nobody thought that in the late 90s. When the character of Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) was first create in a series of Russell Bates, TV Shorts for the 1996/1997 VH1 Fashion Awards. It only reach, moderated success as a minor hit. When Zoolander was released to theaters, it was two weeks after 9/11 & no one was going to the movie theaters in fear of a terrorist attack. If they did, they weren't going to see, a comedy based on three year old TV short, that barely noticeable. There was a lot of fear that this movie would indeed flop. Director, Writer, and Producer, Ben Stiller was even, asked by the studios to push back the release date, because they felt that nobody would bother watching it. Instead, Stiller didn't push it, because he thought that people of the America needed a laugh after so much misery. He really stood his ground on the subject & released it, regardless if it makes money or not. In the end, his risky decision really did paid off, as the film was a box office success as many saw his absurdity satire on the fashion industry, funny as hell! For me, personally, I have to agree, Zoolander is a really fun watch. I love the movie, at the time and after rewatching it, years later. I still found it to be, very funny. The movie has a lot of very quotable dialogue and the slapstick humor that became so memorable. Even, the most hilarious of body language pose, 'Blue Steel', later become popular, as the notorious duckface look in the selfie generation. Without spoiling the movie too much, I have to say, I was never a huge fan of fashion, but I have to say, Ben Stiller's performance as the blank-faced, slack-jawed, self-obsessed male model is one of his better movie characters. He made me, want to see this film. He was very funny as the clueless, wash up model. His co-star, Owen Wilson, not so much. Wilson was alright as the new male model Hansel taking Zoolander's runway; however, his character is somewhat, underdeveloped. I just wish, the movie had some better jokes for him. At least, he wasn't annoying. I like how, this movie serves as one of the very first, main-stream Ben Stiller & Owen Wilson's joint comedies. They both were able, to play off each other's strengths, to the point, that their on-screen chemistry, became, somewhat of a marketing tool for their later films. As much, as I love the two leads, the supporting characters, the frat pack and celebrity cameos were just as good. Christine Taylor as Zoolander's love interest, Matilda Jeffries & Jerry Stiller as Zoolander's manager, Maury Ballstein was alright in their roles, but if I had to pick one; that outshine them all, it would be Will Ferrell as Jacobim Mugatu, the film's villain. He was so comical. He have the right amount of body language and dialogue timing to make every scene work. I never laugh so hard at his work, before then. He really show, that he can carry a film, after this performance. Glad, their original choice, Andy Dick drop out. Gees that would be horrible! Anyways, the music in this film is also a great treat. It's nice, rehearing songs like 'Relax"" by Frankie Goes to Hollywood & 'Wake me up before you go, go"" by Wham. It plays so well, with the scenes, it's surround with. I also love, how much the movie does shout outs to director, Stanley Kubrick, with all the film references such like Derek's brainwashing sequence which mirrors 1971's A Clockwork Orange & Derek and Hansel imitate the ""Dawn of Man"" sequence in 1968's 2001: A Space Odyssey, complete with the soundtrack playing 'Sprach Zarathustra'. I also, like how whole movie is clearly inspired by the 1962's The Manchurian Candidate. What a classic movie! However, some people believe that Zoolander was more of a rip-off of the 1998 satirical novel, Glamorama by author Bret Easton Ellis. I do have agree with those critics. The similarities between the two media sources are a bit jarring to say the least. No wonder, why Ellis attempted to take legal action against the film. Glad, both parties were able to settle out of court. Still, the movie had some other troubles. The film was never shown in Malaysia, the country mentioned in the film, as it is depicted, the country as impoverished and dependent on child labor's sweatshops. Not only that; but the plot of trying to assassinated the prime minister of Malaysia seem too dark for the country. Malaysia's censorship board deemed, the film definitely unsuitable and banned it. Nevertheless, a certain amount of people from Malaysia has gone on, to watch it, and enjoy it. However, there are somethings that didn't work with Zoolander, for me, personally. I didn't like how the film didn't fix loose ends. Honestly, whatever did happen to shadowy evil council who have been killing world leaders for decades? Also, what did happen to J.P Prewitt (David Duchovny)? There are just, too much questions, this movie didn't answer. Overall: Not only listen to your friend Billy Zane. He's a cool dude, but listen to me, check out Zoolander. You'll be laughing your head off, for sure. It's a great comedy masterpiece.",Zoolander

41,tomgillespie2002,Funny comedy that perfectly mocks the fashion industry,6,17 June 2011,"Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) is a slow-witted fashion model who is known for his 'Blue Steel' look, and has dominated the industry for years. When the new kid on the block, Hansel (Owen Wilson), starts taking the attention away from Zoolander, and journalist Matilda (Stiller's wife Christine Taylor) writes a mocking piece on him, Zoolander considers retirement. He travels back home to work in the coal pits with his father (Jon Voight) and brothers (Vince Vaughn and Judah Friedlander) but they reject him due to his fashion antics and general uselessness in the pits. Meanwhile, fashion giant Jacobim Mugatu (Will Ferrell) is coming up with a plan to assassinate the Prime Minister of Malaysia, and feels that Zoolander is just stupid enough to be the hit- man.I've never really been a fan of the work of Stiller and his usual troupe. While his films are generally entertaining, I just don't find them that funny. Zoolander, though not exactly a classic, is possibly his best, being frequently funny, silly, and most important of all, fun. For all it's prat-falls and ridiculous costumes, it is actually a pretty damn accurate send-up of the fashion industry. Many a time I've been forced to sit through the likes of America's Next Top Model and whatever new s**t Gok Wan has come up with (I detest that man with every fabric of my being), and it is really this ridiculous.The cleverist moment of the film is when Mugatu announces his new fashion show, called Derelicte, spinning fashion out of the bums and hobo's that roam the streets. It's just the type of pretentious and shallow thing that happens in fashion all the time, taking its influences from the unfortunate and putting it's own naive and clueless fingers all over it. Anyway, that's enough about my hatred for the fashion industry, now for the actual film.Zoolander has the thing that seems to missing from Stiller's usual films, which is sweetness. As gay as that sounds, it helps elevate the likes of Judd Apatow's films above others, and helps you actually care about the film rather than it being played just for laughs. Tropic Thunder and Dogeball: A True Underdog Story certainly tried, and ultimately failed. Although Zoolander is a shallow idiot, he is certainly lovable. And as Hansel, the always-watchable Owen Wilson is just a dim-witted. When the two settle their rivalry and team up, there is plenty of chemistry. Watching them both giggle like children when talking about bulimia is a scene where if handled badly, could have been uncomfortable, but the scene is possibly the funniest in the film.Yes, it follows the same path as many other a comedy, and some of the jokes fail to hit the mark. But it's fun, entertaining, and features a handful of solid comedy performances. And, as ever, Will Ferrell steals the show as a manically over-the-top designer.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Zoolander

After Derek Zoolander lost the male model award at the VH1 Awards and then his three best friends die in a gas fight accident he decides to retire. The acting is annoying and Ben Stiller's voice is real annoying and unfunny.But after when Derek retires his boss Maury Ballstein (Jerry Stiller) offers him to join Jacobin Mugatu (Will Ferrell) agency.

Only in Time Magazine journalist Matilda (Christine Taylor) suspicion arises slowly, and she tries to stop Derek.Later in the movie Derek and Hansel start having a friendship between each other. There were many weird parts but one that I liked was when they were showing Derek at the day spa and he was listening to relax and they were showing this crazy video at the same time!

As a rewatch 07/08/18' and over 8+ years after the first watch, opinions on this film remain around the same. Having forgotten a lot of what happened in the film though it remains a silly comedy with that intentions but overall the jokes aren't funny and are misses. It comes off as cringe and corny and the plot is predictable. As read from critics before, the film does have an SNL type feel where it feels like a comedy skit.

Ben Stiller can be quite funny...or not, and Owen Wilson I tend to dislike, but he's quite good in this. The two play moronic supermodels who are dueling with their male beauty.

45,funkyfry,Fairly solid comedy with inspired moments,7,3 April 2003,"A pretty smart film that masquerades as a spoof of male fashion (who needed to spoof that, anyway) but is really a satire of Western culture on some levels.  On other levels, it's mostly straightforward physical comedy, but there is enough visual quality and the actors are also good, so this is well pulled off.  Stiller is over the top as the model who uncovers an international cartel who use male models to assassinate world leaders (this is all in the first 30 minutes, folks).  He appears in many scenes with his father, and their chemistry is excellent.  Ferrell is excellent and also way over the top as the cartel's lead muscle man/world famous designer.  There were 2 really funny scenes I don't want to give away, but what really cracked me up here was how straight Jon Voight played his character, and it is his character if you know what I mean.  The movie never took a blink from a straight approach to his ""I'm a rugged coal miner whose son is a flamboyant male model"" role, and I applaud it for its judgement.Not a great movie that it perhaps aimed to be, but easily the best mainstream American comedy I've seen since ""Austin Powers"".",Zoolander
46,Anonymous_Maxine,"Occasionally, Zoolander is painfully hilarious, but even that does not overshadow the pre-production goals of lucrative cheeseball comedy and the tasteless subject matter that resulted.",6,6 May 2002,"Zoolander is the story of the hottest but dumbest male model in the world, Derek Zoolander (who happens to be living the skinny American Dream of getting paid vast amounts of money to have his picture taken and become famous), who grows disillusioned with the modeling industry after he is suddenly overshadowed by another male model at an awards show, and is then targeted and effortlessly brainwashed to assassinate the Prime Minister of Malaysia in order to perpetuate the male modeling industry. Evidently, that Prime Minister is just too set in his efforts to eradicate child labor in Malaysia, which would just be an unacceptable blow to the fashion industry, which relies too much on the efforts of such child labor. The first thing that strikes me about this plotline is that, with the astronomical amount of money that circulates in the fashion industry, most of which goes into the sickening paychecks of the powerful people involved in that industry, I would think that they could finally start paying regular prices for the manufacturing of the clothing that they use in their business.Why is it that the hugest and richest corporations always seem to be the ones involved in child labor?  One of the great ironies of capitalism (and, indeed one of the more disturbing ones) is that the more money people have, the less they want to spend. So we get these dirt-poor kids in foreign countries who spend long days in sweatshops making these products for next to nothing, and then the products are shipped here where they're modeled and then sold at astronomical prices.Besides that, I was truly shocked that they portrayed the Prime Minister of Malaysia, who is a real person, as the ""antagonist"" who wants to eradicate child labor laws, and they make him the target of this ludicrous assassination. As Roger Ebert mentioned, did NOBODY involved with the movie think that maybe that was in bad taste? I'm sure that nobody who was involved in the overlooking of this massive point meant any harm by this, but Derek Zoolander also meant no harm in being brainwashed, but that doesn't make him very intelligent. It seems strange that the film is structured entirely around this plot to have Derek Zoolander assassinate the Prime Minister, and yet the comedy in the film comes entirely from his tiny intellect. The fact that we laugh at the hilarious extent of Derek's stupidity and the similar allusion to an alleged lack of cognitive activity in the fashion industry as a whole (`Derek, me help you did!'), and not Derek's working over by Mugatu, the real antagonist in the film, completely eliminates the need for any subplot, especially one that involves a plot to murder a real and highly respected world leader.While I was overall less than impressed by the film, I can't say that I didn't just about lose consciousness laughing so hard at Zoolander's response when J.P. Prewitt (David Duchovny) told him that Mugatu will most likely use some kind of auditory or visual Pavlovian response mechanism to get him to kill the Prime Minister (`An after party?'), and then again at Prewitt's response after having been shot when Zoolander takes off on his mission and steps on his glass-encased hand (`AAAHHHhhh you freakin' idiot!'). THAT was some great stuff, and there are at least three or four other moments of quality laughs, but it's just too bad that there was so much tasteless content in the movie, especially since it went far beyond the childish and disgusting humor that usually plagues bad comedies these days (American Pie, the Scary Movies, Road Trip, Sorority Boys, etc.). Watch the movie for the great interactions between Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, but be advised that there is some truly tasteless and often offensive content in the movie, and it can't all be dismissed just by acknowledging the fact that it's just some goofball comedy.",Zoolander

You might say that this is the 21st century version of the ""Airplane"" or ""The Naked Gun"".I actually envy the talent of Ben Stiller who's got the guts to spend millions of dollar on story full of silly gabs. He pulls it off with remarkable high quality as he often does.This is one of the best produced movie I've seen in its category. I really loved it.

48,meeza,Good Looking But Not Great Looking!,7,2 October 2001,"As I finished watching `Zoolander', I was as confused as the main character's mental state. I thought that Ben Stilller was super as the mentally-challenged male model Derek Zoolander. But I thought its plot that involved killing the President of Malaysia was a bit too far fetched. I also did think Will Ferrell was the right fit to play the freaky-haired malicious designer. However, I thought that Christine Taylor's performance as the female reporter made me bulimic.  I thought Director Ben Stiller's mockery of the model business had a real humorous design to it. But on the other hand, at times it was too over exposed. `Zoolander' is one attraction that at times will make you laugh even though it is not the perfect model of a great comedy. *** Average",Zoolander

Loaded up with eyeball-rolling gags and perfectly-timed celebrity cameos, it's overstuffed with stream-of-consciousness satire and the very best veins of Ben Stiller's unchained sense of humor. Stiller's ironic crosshairs wave all over the place, landing precise jabs at society, fashion, politics and celebrity while still finding time to keep the ridiculous primary narrative in motion. Owen Wilson is flawless as Zoolander's flaky new-wave rival Hansel (he's so hot right now) and Will Ferrell makes the most of a criminally-brief amount of screen time in his own inimitable way. I was blown away by how creatively funny this was the first time I sat down with it, and I'm equally amazed with how well it's held up over the ensuing eleven years. The laughs simply do not stop coming.",Zoolander
50,jimbo-53-186511,"There are lots of cameos here, but sadly there aren't lots of laughs",2,17 September 2015,"Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) finds his life turned upside down when he fails to defend his male model of the year title (losing to Hansel - Owen Wilson). However, Derek's life seemingly takes a turn for the better when he's hired by Mugatu (Will Ferrell), but Mugatu isn't who he seems to be and it turns out that he intends to hypnotise Derek to get him to kill the President Of Malaysia.Despite the stupidity of the premise, this could have actually stood a chance. The storyline is daft, but to its credit it is at least original and fairly imaginative. Ben Stiller and his co-writers also got the characterisations of the models right; both Zoolander and Hansel are self-absorbed, shallow, and unintelligent which are very much the given clichés for models. This is all well and good, but what the film lacks is any real laughs (I don't think I laughed once). The humour that did exist wrapped around the same concepts (the models being self-absorbed, shallow and unintelligent) and it got to the point where it became tiresome and uninteresting.I was also surprised about the casting of Owen Wilson as a model. Whilst Stiller isn't that convincing either Wilson is less believable given the fact that his nose looks like it's been smashed with a hammer about a dozen times. I wouldn't mention any of this if the idea of them being the two best looking men around was something that was merely a figment of their imaginations, but the fact that we're genuinely meant to go along with this means that it lacks some of the irony that I'm sure that Stiller and co were striving for. Sticking with performances I found Will Ferrell to be not funny here and too much most of the time. Everyone else was OK, but there weren't any standout performances. This film is probably best remembered for the numerous cameos that are seen here and yes they're fun for a bit, but it gets to the point where spotting the cameos starts to lose its appeal.Zoolander has a promising and original idea, but sadly the material isn't great and the result is a film with very few laughs. Most attempts at humour are either predictable or simply not funny. Many of the performances are over the top and irritating (particularly Will Ferrell who was unbearable). To its credit, Zoolander does have quite a good, positive end to it, but unfortunately it has far too much working against it and is a film that is best avoided.",Zoolander

52,myriamlenys,satire about the fashion industry,7,17 April 2019,"A decent but uneven comedy about the fashion industry, celebrity culture and male modelling. One cannot accuse the various makers of cluelessness or ignorance : many of their barbs are well-aimed and spot-on. (The various grin-inducing costumes are particularly successful.) It's clear that these people did their homework, bigly.The plot about child labour - where do you think your clothes come from ? - is not treated with the depth and seriousness due to such a subject, but at least the movie is brave enough to mention the elephant in the room, which is more than can be said about many fashion- or lifestyle-related comedies. It's a deeply depressing thought that the global situation has not improved since 2001, in spite of all the promises and campaigns.Ben Stiller is superb as a male model with incredible cheekbones and less brains than God gave to a baby mouse. Watch his merman commercial about ""Moisture is the essence of wetness"" - it's one for the ages... Also priceless : the line about bulimia (""So you can read minds ?"").",Zoolander

54,slokes,Real Vanity Project,4,19 December 2004,"Ben Stiller not only stars but directs and writes this send-up of the fashion world, playing a character named Derek Zoolander whom he invented for a running bit on VH1's annual fashion show. Though there's intermittent laughs, the padding really shows in a story annoyingly full of itself.That goes double for Stiller, who thinks that playing his character as vain and narcissistic will keep us from noticing how vain and narcissistic Stiller himself can be. First, the whole movie exists to serve his image, which has him done up in all sorts of costumes and hair styles that show off his fine cheekbones and lean torso. Then he casts his family in key roles. His wife, the attractive if lightweight Christine Taylor, is the female lead and Derek's romantic interest. His father Jerry has the plum role of Derek's agent. Even his mother, Anne Meara, gets a quick, pointless cameo. Then there's his regular posse of friends who all seem to show up in each other's movies, like Owen Wilson as a rival model named Hansel and Will Ferrell as the villain Mugatu, who wears eyeliner and blonde ringlets which form the shape of a letter M.That's what's funny about this movie, the weird fashion. It serves the comedy well. The problem is that there are long sections where the fashion is the comedy, like Mugatu's odd sweaters and Derek wearing an all-white outfit to a funeral.Male models are dumb. That's the main joke, and while I'm happy to unfairly categorize any group of people I am insanely jealous of, it doesn't sustain 90 minutes of movie time. Nor does a strange espionage subplot where Derek is brainwashed to murder the prime minister of Malaysia. Some people like Roger Ebert attacked the film for trying to mine comedy from such a thing as the cruel reality of child labor, but the film's heart is in the right place. If it only had a brain...Watching this film once was amusing, but seeing it again reveals holes. Take Derek's brief trip back to his New Jersey hometown where his working class father and brothers are ashamed of Derek. This is hurt by the fact Jon Voight as the father has zero comedy presence in his scenes. Then there's a bit where Derek is consoled by Winona Ryder as Winona Ryder, which serves only to ring up another of the many cameos in this film, most ranging in character from obnoxious to repulsively inside. Even Paris Hilton says hello. I guess Stiller had a fun premiere night, and that may have been the point.Only two sequences hold up with repeat viewing, one a short bit where we meet and see off Derek's roommates, and another, shorter sequence where Hansel has a breakdance fight with an evil DJ. Ferrell's funny, too, but the film doesn't give him much of anything to do except bulge his eyes and say lines like ""That Hansel's so hot right now"" in a dry femmy voice. Because it's Ferrell, you laugh, but it's not a role of his worth remembering.The first time I saw it, I was about to go to a funeral, and I needed some dumb comedy. This fit the bill. Still, it was hard to understand why it was so popular when it came out. Then I checked its initial reviews and realized it was released in late September, 2001. I guess we all needed some dumb comedy then.The world has changed, but not ""Zoolander."" It's still dumb.",Zoolander

Zoolander definitely did not live up to the hype of being fall down in your seat funny but it wasn't awful either. I must admit there actually were a few laugh out loud funny lines. But by and large this movie is disjointed and somewhat obnoxious at times. This isn't really the type of comedy that I enjoy and it seems like Stiller is ALWAYS playing these types of roles(granted he plays them well but still....)The main positive was the movie's spoofs of the fashion industry and the people involved in it. I have actually known a few people with personalities like this. Even though the movie by and large wasn't an extremely cohesive effort it was funny to see the fashion industry being spoofed- and some of the jokes WERE funny, in fact there are moments where just as your getting ready to turn it off because your thinking how lame it is, something happens to make you laugh and keep it on.I'd recommend this movie only as a late night or if there isn't anything else on or if you want a really off the wall comedy with uneven but occasionally wacky humor. This is the type of movie that you almost feel guilty for defending because all the negatives mentioned are there but it's not all bad for the reasons listed above.

Zoolander was meant to be a stand alone film. Anyway, what can I say to review this film? It is a comedic classic that stands the test of time. You'll have a grin on your face for most of the movie. The one part that was a little played out was the scene were Zoolander and Hansel are looking for files inside the computer and slapping it around like apes.

61,sme_no_densetsu,A fun comedy from Stiller and company,8,14 September 2015,"""Zoolander"" stands out in Ben Stiller's sometimes uneven film career as one of his most memorable movies. In it, he plays title character Derek Zoolander, a dimwitted male model whose career is on the decline. Disillusioned with the business, he seeks to do something meaningful with his life but instead becomes a pawn in an assassination plot.The movie doesn't take itself too seriously and is definitely slanted more towards dumb humour. That isn't to say that the screenplay is lowbrow but rather that it utilizes the cluelessness of its lead characters for much of its humour. It's also worth noting that there are a number of memorable quotes throughout the course of the movie.I find Stiller's portrayal of Zoolander to be a bit broad for my taste but it is an effective characterization nonetheless. Owen Wilson is much more natural as Zoolander's rival Hansel. The two have good comedic chemistry together and also work well with female lead Christine Taylor. Will Ferrell is memorable as outlandish designer Mugatu and so are Milla Jovovich, David Duchovny & Jon Voight in smaller roles. The movie also features a number of celebrity cameos, including notable ones from David Bowie & Billy Zane.Behind the camera, Stiller's direction is nicely handled and more focused on comedic effect than flashy visuals. That being said, the cinematography, costumes & production design combine to give the movie a vibrant look. The soundtrack is also well chosen.Ultimately, ""Zoolander"" may not be a masterpiece of sophisticated comedy but it is a fun (and funny) movie with memorable performances and an entertaining script. I'm not sure if there's really a need for the sequel that's currently in development but the original is certainly worth watching.",Zoolander
62,Screen_Blitz,Zoolander is funny enough to excuse for how spectacularly goofy it gets,7,14 October 2017,"Ben Stiller is the titular character of this comedy that does not believe in being particularly smart. It is dumb, but with such infectious comedic energy by Stiller and friend Owen Wilson poured on screen, it is funny enough to look past how ridiculous it gets. Stiller, also filling in the director's chair, conducts a comedy that lends a satirical look at the modeling industry and how competition can bring out both the best and the worst in those who compete for the big prize. This is where the small, but significant amount of cleverness comes into the picture. But it is Stiller and Wilson are smoke the air with their comedic energy to make this into a film that offers just enough laughs and fun to compensate for its short runtime. While it certainly isn't consistently funny, with occasional botched attempts at humor, it knows how to tickle the funny bone for a film that resists against engaging the brain. This film follows acclaimed fashion model Derek Zoolander (played by Ben Stiller), a three-time consecutive award winner who is on his way to claiming his fourth prize as ""Model of The Year"". All this hopes are eventually crushed when the prize goes to his rival Hansel (played by Owen Wilson). To make matters worse, he find himself on the cover of a magazine mocked as an ""idiot"" by columnist Matilda (played by Christine Taylor). Throwing in the towel, Zoolander decides to pursue on a new path, possibly opening up an institute for children who have trouble reading. His goals are soon put a halt by dubious fashion designer Mugatu (played by Will Ferrell) who uses a machine to brainwash him into killing the prime minister of Malaysia as an outcry against child labor. With this mind out of whack, you must turn to Matilda and form a bond with his rival Hansel to help from committing this diabolical plot. Ben Stiller leads a cast of comedic veterans who seem to have fun acting like dimwits, and the result is a ride through whacky stupidity. But if you are willing to scoot past the dominating stupidity and the politically offensive plot of assassinating a foreign leader for a debatable cause, you are rewarded with a hilarious good time. This film offers a clever escapism into dumb territory where acting foolish equates to gut-busting laughter and its cast prove their ability for displaying solid comedic timing, even when it fails on an occasional basis. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson cook up an infectious comic energy in nearly scene they both meet on screen, and the energy unravels into funny laugh-out-loud sequences including a fashion showdown scene, another segment owing homage to '2001: A Space Odyssey', and the final scene showcasing their attempts at turning the tables on the comically antagonistic Will Ferrell. Supplementing these scenes are loads of unexpected celebrity cameos including David Bowie, Natalie Portman, Lenny Kravitz, Cuba Gooding Jr. and many others. On the other hand, there are moments where the cast falls shorts when taking a stab at the funny bone, whether it is from attempting slapstick gags that are better fit for 'The Three Stooges', or spewing vulgar, but PG-13 friendly dialogue. No need to worry though, Stiller, Wilson, and Ferrell manage to compensate for some of the dull moments. Christine Taylor, Stiller's wife, and Jerry Stiller (playing Zoolander's agent), his dad, have a few good lines, but perhaps not enough to count for memorable roles. For Taylor, her most memorable would be an orgy scene that demands for editing cuts when the film was initially slapped with an R-rating. Zoolander is a comedy loaded with laughter and infectious charisma, and Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, and Will Ferrell deserve the credit for this. Yes, it is goofy, but it is a goofy ride that is worth hopping into if you are hungry for some feel-good laughs. While the movie isn't consistently with its hilarity, it is definitely enough to warrant a viewing for a fair number of comedic fanatics.",Zoolander
63,dunmore_ego,A Stiller Thriller,8,28 October 2008,"""Did you ever think that there was more to life than being really really really ridiculously good-looking?"" - Derek Zoolander. ZOOLANDER (directed by Ben Stiller, co-written by Ben Stiller, starring Ben Stiller) is Ben Stiller's best film. Ever. Did I mention Ben Stiller? Written by Stiller, Drake Sather and John Hamburg, ZOOLANDER follows Stiller, as the eponymous Derek Zoolander, a ""really really really good-looking"" male model, three-time winner of the Male Model of the Year Award, on his journey of self-discovery, from self-involved Male Model who trademarked the ""looks"" Ferrari, Le Tigre, and of course, Blue Steel (I've always been a fan!), to the realization that his good looks and incredibly chiseled abs could be used in founding The Center For Kids Who Can't Read Good. Existing on minimal brain activity, Derek lives with three other Male Models, apparently as intelligence-challenged as he, Brint, Rufus and Meekus. When they all meet a grisly end in a gas station explosion, Derek calls it a ""freak accident"" in his ""eugoogly"" - the fact that they were effeminately hosing each other with gasoline (in characteristic slow motion Male Model idiom) and then lighting a cigarette doesn't solve the mystery. So begins Derek's journey through the seedy underbelly of Male Modeling - Malaysian child labor for stylish slacks, the assassination of Kennedy by two lookers on the grassy knoll, and his own brainwashing by crooked fashion designer, Mugatu (Will Ferrell, as outré as he wants to be, in poodle haircut and petulance flambé), to kill the Malaysian Prime Minister who opposes child labor laws (because that would stop the flow of stylish slacks). Derek's subliminal signal  of all things  is eighties dance-slash-gay hit, Relax by Frankie Goes to Hollywood.Along the way, he must face-off (or ""walk-off,"" as the Male Modeling case may be) a new youngblood uber-hippie toy-boy, Hansel (Owen Wilson). When Derek loses Male Model of the Year to Hansel, in an attempt to desperately re-flame his career, he accepts an assignment from Mugatu, and all posing breaks loose. Who knew THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE would end up down Derek Zoolander's tight trousers?Investigative journalist, Matilda (Stiller's delectable real-life wife, Christine Taylor, eternally Marcia Brady), must save Derek from Mugatu's plot, and seek asylum with Derek's mortal enemy, Hansel, whom they discover idolizes Derek. Will Ferrell is so funny in this movie as crooked fashion icon, Mugatu, that we were all fooled into thinking he was a comedian. Until film-makers made the mistake of letting him star in his own movies... (UNRELATED SIDE-NOTE. Mugato: continually mispronounced as ""Mugatu"" by Captain Kirk on STAR TREK episode No. 45 A Private Little War, the Mugato was a goofy carnivore-ape-thing resembling an albino version of The Rhino (a fruity supervillain from Spiderman comics), that put Kirk in a coma).Jerry Stiller (Ben's real dad) is Maury Ballstein, Derek's agent; Jon Voight is Derek's miner dad, ashamed of his son being a mermaid in a commercial (MerMAN! MerMAN!). Roaring cameos by David Bowie, Billy Zane, Fabio; David Duchovny appears, unrecognizable, to mumble about - what else? - conspiracy.An insensate homage to insensate Male Models everywhere, ZOOLANDER is one of the funniest comedies ever made, because it never loses its way in the third act, where many laugh-a-minute movies turn into drama or chase films. ZOOLANDER gleefully retains its flamboyant extremism and piles on the idiocy to the very last frame  the fountain dedicated to Derek's tragically deceased Male Model friends, splishing only water from their stone petrol hoses this time, sploshing out front of The Derek Zoolander Center For Kids Who Can't Read Good And Who Wanna Learn To Do Other Stuff Good Too.",Zoolander
64,pyrocitor,"Really, really, ridiculously good",10,19 August 2004,"(spoilers herein)I cannot remember the last time I laughed so hard at a movie as when I saw Zoolander. I say that in all fairness - I've been to many funny movies since, expecting to have to revise that statement, but Zoolander remains on top for the sheer volume of belly laughs it provides.For a movie about male models (this has to be the first of it's kind), Zoolander was surprisingly creative and original. The plot is absurd, but it's the same for most comedies. Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) is VH1's 3 time winner of the male model of the year award, and he's running for his fourth. True to form, Zoolander will never be winning any intelligence contests, but he models well enough, despite not being able to spell the word. He's famous for his trademark look which he calls 'Blue Steel', but he has been working on a different look, 'Magnum' for the last 8 or 9 years, but sadly, it is still nowhere near ready. His rival for the title is laid back, stoner hippie boy Hansel (Owen Wilson). Zoolander is taken completely by surprise when Hansel unexpectedly wins the award, and he starts pondering that perhaps his purpose in life is to be something other than 'really really ridiculously good looking.' Confused and overwhelmed, he retires from the male modeling profession, much to the chagrin of his agent Maury Ballstein. (Jerry Stiller, Ben's real life dad, in one of the funniest performances in the movie) Derek attempts to return to his roots at the coal mining town in New Jersey, in hopes of figuring out his ultimate purpose in life. But after a less than welcome reception from his two brothers (Vince Vaughn has a cameo as one) and father, (Jon Voight) and a phone call from Maury telling him that legendary fashion designer Jacobim Mugatu (Will Ferrell) wants Zoolander for his new campaign, Derek decides to return to what he knows best.Mugatu, it turns out, has a ulterior motive for having Zoolander join his campaign. The prime minister of Malaysia is attempting to put a stop to child labor, which Mugatu will not tolerate, since most of his designs are made in poorer countries. So Mugatu and his freaky 'she-male' Russian bodyguard Katinka Ingobovinana (Milla Jovovich, who claimed she was playing her mother) brainwash Derek, so that whenever he hears the 80's classic song 'Relax', he will turn into a homicidal master of martial arts, and murder the Malaysian Prime Minister.Only journalist Matilda Jeffries (Christine Taylor) really knows what is going on. She tries to keep Derek from Mugatu and Katinka by hiding out in the last place they would ever expect to look: Hansel's hangout. Surprisingly, Zoolander and Hansel patch up their differences remarkably quickly, and after the two of them and Matilda share some 'seriously strong tea' and an orgy with some Finnish dwarfs and a Maori tribesman, the three of them are the best of friends. (Zoolander not so secretly begins to fall for Matilda as well)Between the three of them, they manage to stop Derek from assassinating the Malaysian Prime Minister, exposing Mugatu for the fiend that he is, and meanwhile releasing 'Magnum' to the public. Bottom line, everyone lives happily ever after. The costumes sported by all fashion related characters are ridiculously creative, going way over the top in terms of reality, but it's a nice play on how the really famous fashion designers can get away with pretty much anything they want once they're a big enough name. (I still don't think Mugatu would have gotten away with his 'Derelique' show, that might have been a step too far) The film is packed with great cameos from real-life models and fashion designers, actors playing themselves, and they even managed to fit in David Bowie somehow. These were cute and effective, but it's in the main characters that we get the majority of our laughs. Ben Stiller really made the movie by playing clueless model Derek Zoolander, a character he and Drake Sather created for the 1996 fashion awards. I have seen many of Ben Stiller's movies, and I personally think that this is his funniest performance yet. (a close second being his fitness trainer White Goodman from 'Dodgeball') Stiller and Owen Wilson collaborate magnificently as usual, and are very downright funny as their warring male models Derek Zoolander and Hansel. Most of the films best moments are the interactions between their characters.(there's a great take off on 2001: A space odyssey as Derek and Hansel make monkey noises trying to turn on a computer) The duo are also blessed with the ingenious addition of comic genius Will Ferrell as evil fashion designer Jacobim Mugatu. Ferrell, true to form, improvised and changed most of his lines to better suit his interpretation of the character, and the result is nothing less than comedic magic. Ben Stiller's real-life wife Christine Taylor was rather bland, but funny nonetheless as 'investigatory journalist' Matilda Jeffries.Stiller also directed the film to great effect. Many people questioned the decision to direct himself, but I thought it worked out fine. Stiller had directed films in the past, and this isn't his first time directing himself, so he's not likely to make a complete mess of things. Quite the opposite in fact: Stiller proved a perfect choice to direct, injecting his personal, wacky sense of humour into the film. Zoolander is riddled with funny touches, such as when someone makes a funny facial expression, the camera will just freeze on it, so the audiences are more likely to notice it. As well, all the main characters (and David Bowie) are introduced by introductory captions which appear spontaneously throughout the film. This was a brilliant touch, and it worked very well.This is Stiller at his best, in both acting and directing. Zoolander is a much overlooked and under-appreciated comedy -definitely worth seeing. Just be ready to laugh...a lot.-9/10",Zoolander

66,Sirus_the_Virus,"Really funny, but pretty retarded.",7,8 August 2009,"Ben Stiller's Zoolander is so stupid that it's funny. It's one of those movies. If you walked into the theater expecting something different, than you probably hated it. I'm not saying I love Zoolander, but I think it's pretty funny. I don't know what inspired Ben Stiller to direct this stupid film. I do truly like Zoolander, despite how stupid it is. There are many funny scenes in Zoolander and it has a great cast, I think you should see Zoolander. But if you're expecting something different, then beware. Because Zoolander is dumb at times, but I think it's a pretty funny film.The Plot: Derek Zoolander is a male model. He is convinced by Mugatu to assassinate the president of Mulasia through Brainwash.Though the plot is silly, I like Zoolander for what it is. The film has many cameos by Billy Zane, David Bowie, David Duchovney, and others. Just to name a few. Zoolander is also a weird film, but most of Ben Stiller's films are. Just look at The Cable Guy, it's about a cable guy who becomes obsessed with somebody and once this guy tells him to go away, he tries to make his life hell. The Cable Guy was an odd film also, but I really like that one. As weird as it was in the last ten minutes. The cast to Zoolander includes: Owen Wilson(Wedding Crashers, You, me, and Dupree) Chistine Taylor(The Brady Bunch films, Dodgeball) Jerry Stiller(Seinfeld) Jon Voigt(Tomb Raider, National Treasure) Despite Zoolander's stupidity at times, I like Zoolander.

Ben Stiller is Derek Zoolander, reigning international male model until Owen Wilson comes on the scene. Subplot involves scheme by fashion mogul Will Farrell to use Derek to kill third world leader, but the most fun is in the spoof of modeling by Stiller and Wilson. Hard to understand the spread of IMDb reviews on this movie, I would say it's definitely a notch above the typical SNL-type theme comedy movie (Strange Brew, etc) but falls a little short of a comedy classic. Farrell is a lot of fun in his role, David Bowie has an inspired appearance and Stiller and Wilson almost always play well together. Taylor's many reaction shots are also priceless.

Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) is a washed-up model who has been brainwashed to kill a foreign Prime Minister. Sound stupid? That's because it's supposed to be. We have a handful of male models, all of them with IQs lower than their body fat percentage, and all of them getting into situations that they are not mentally equipped for.You can't watch ""Zoolander"" for its story or its characters, you can only watch it for its inane humour.

70,lambiepie-2,"The Best of the ""Fashionatas""",8,3 March 2007,"This is a true laugh and chuckle fest. No big meaning, quite the slap to male models, high fashion, fashion houses, folks in fashion and those who have opinions against the industry as well. It comes together interestingly enough, and that is what makes it fun.Basically the story is you have a dense, clueless, top of his game male model named Zoolander (played by Stiller) who is as egotistical as they come and thinks he's going to win his 4th time as top male model. His life is all faux clothing artistic and design and that was fine - as long as he was on top. Then comes competition, another semi clueless model (played by Owen Wilson) who takes Zoolander's number one spot and his 4th win for top male model. After loosing, Zoolander realizes he must do something 'more positive for the world' besides looking good. With his fellow dense male model roomies, Zoolander decides to find out what that is. But tragedy strikes, and his roomie models are killed in one of the funniest scenes ever. Zoolander decides to go back to his roots and his male family members which is in a small mining town that doesn't take too kindly too male modeling. Not being able to find a place for himself, he returns to modeling to really find out who he is and what he can do to make a difference in the world. ANd that's the story.Well..ummm...sorta. There are funny twists and turns in this, plenty of cameos by folks who can poke fun of themselves, a good Stiller family affair and the best over-the-top performance by Will Farrell who had to study every high and overly ego-ed male fashionata designer of the past 30 years.Nothing to take too seriously here, just a lot of fun and silliness. And every now and then, that's all you need to make you feel a bit better about an industry and people who think way too much of themselves. Maybe ...they laughed as they watched this too.",Zoolander
71,baumer,The start of the frat pack,10,3 May 2007,"I think Zoolander was released before anyone really understood it's humour. I recall listening to the director's commentary on the DVD and Stiller commented that there really weren't that many people who saw this at the theater and he was thankful for those that were listening to him now. Little did he know that Zoolanderer would go on to develop one of the biggest cult followings in history. The humour and perhaps first unofficial grouping of the ""frat pack"" contributes to the quality and the hilarity in the film. We all know that Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson and Will Ferrel appear in the film but even Vince Vaughn has a non-speaking role as one of Derek Zoolander's mining brothers.Zoolander's strength is the absurd comedy, unbelievably stupid characters and more funny that it should be script. All three provide us with so much to enjoy and it succeeds because of this.Ben Stiller plays Derek Zoolander, the fashion industry's biggest model. He has won the VH1's model of the year 4 years in a row, he is ""really, really, really good looking"" and he has not equal. But this year up and coming hippie model ""Hansel"" played for pure laughs by frat pack member and Stiller crony Owen Wilson, has just taken his crown. He is the complete antithesis to Zoolander as he snowboards, eats junk food and enjoys life in a Zen like fashion. He and Zoolander are complete opposites and obviously don't like each other because of competition.Will Ferrel plays Mugatu, a flamboyant and meterosexual like fashion designer who has ideas of brainwashing Zoolander so he can kill the Malaysian Prime Minister so that they can keep their sweat shops open and produce clothing for pennies. His genius plan is to hypnotize Zoolander, and trigger him by using Frankie Goes To Hollywood's Relax, to get him to kill The Prime Minsister. It's funnier than it sounds.Zoolander, when you describe it is not as funny as when you see it. Zoolander is one of the dimmest characters ever created. He can't turn left, he is working on developing Blue Steel, his new ""look"" that is really just the same as every other vapid, moronic look he has. He doesn't understand that building models to 1/10th the scale of something is not the real thing. Hence you get the line in the movie, ""What is this? A school for ants?"" He and Hansel have a walk off, where Billy Zane and David Bowie appear for no reason other than they can. Here they do various model cat walk moves to the sounds of Beat It by Michael Jackson. Stiller has so many ideas in here and he tries to fit them all in the movie. And more times that not they succeed. Even the mistakes in the film are funny.Zoolander is one of the funniest film of the decade. And it's one of my favourites.10/10",Zoolander
72,blott2319-1,Goofy fun,7,30 October 2020,"Sometimes it seems there is a very limited number of ideas that comedy writers return to when they need to create laughs. Perhaps the most frequently used concept on that list of tropes is the idea of the fool. Making a character who is clearly dumb in comparison to everyone else is treated as comedy gold by many people, and I can't blame the creators for falling back on this, because it seems like it would be easier to write. Zoolander is another in that tradition, and I feel like I should be annoyed since it is so horribly unoriginal, yet I found it funny. When it comes to humor, that is the trump card. It doesn't matter how old the joke is, if it still makes you laugh then it succeeded. I think it helped that the movie calls out Zoolander's idiocy. People around him don't accept this moron as if he's just like every other human being, in fact he is hand-selected in the plot for being clueless.The cruel mocking of the fashion industry didn't bother me either. I found it quite hilarious how they not only pointed out the lack of intelligence among the male models, but also lampooned the entire idea of fashion labels and fashion shows. At times the movie approached a level of spoof that made me think of Airplane and other off-the-wall parodies. I thought Ben Stiller did a nice job in the lead role, and he had a convincing way of displaying confidence despite Zoolander's shortcomings. The romance angle was forced, and could have easily been left out of the film, but I still like Christine Taylor's presence as an intelligent counterpoint to the male models. I wouldn't say that Zoolander is a genius movie or brilliant art, but it was funny and that's all I can ask.",Zoolander

So he plans to set up an assassination on the prime minister when he visits the world famous fashion show put up in New York.And Mugatu will brainwash Derek Zoolander into killing the prime minister. Derek Zoolander was the most over rated and most popular male model in New York. Right until his competitor Hansel, out won him at the best looking male model awards. Which made Zoolander down on his luck. Because modeling for clothes and being good looking is his life. And is yet to come up with a new look that'll be called the Magnum. Will Zoolander find something else in life besides Male Modeling? And will Mugatsu successfully succeed in his conspiracy plan? I was never a fan of Ben Stiller. But I gotta admit that this one is a little better than his other movies. Owen Wilson is good and also teamed up with Stiller in ""Starsky Hutch""(which wasn't all that great). And Will Ferrel's role as a villain is rather different than his other appearances. But I'm not a fan of him either.Zoolander is one of those average comedies with some slapstick to it.

74,mattymatt4ever,"Take it with a grain of salt; still not a riot, but worth renting",6,30 March 2002,"""Zoolander"" is a stupid, silly, ridiculous farce that has to be accepted for what it is.  It's a harmless comedy with no hilarious moments, but it's funny to a degree.  The problem is most of the time I found myself laughing AT the film, rather than with it.  There's very little wit, and you simply have to laugh at Derek Zoolander's sheer stupidity.  The plot is meandering, and seems to purposely set itself up for a million cameos.  Don't get me wrong, the cameos are amusing, but it seems like Stiller was taking cheap shots by inserting big-time celebrities into every scene.  And I'm not exaggerating when I say this film is jam-packed with cameos.  Hell, if you made ""It's a Mad Mad Mad World"" into a 90-minute feature, you very well might get ""Zoolander.""  Just to name a few, there's cameos by Cuba Gooding Jr., Christian Slater, Winona Ryder, Billy Zane, Vince Vaughn (in a disappointing, non-speaking role), Andy Dick, David Duchovny and Stiller's own parents, Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara.  I'm surprised Stiller couldn't find screen time for his long-time buddy Janeane Garofolo.  Stiller puts his best foot forward in his lively comic peformance, and seems to be having a lot of fun, but Zoolander is a bit of a one-joke caricature and he tries his best to salvage laughs despite that.  Owen Wilson delivers a delightful comic performance as his arch rival, Hansel.  The walk-off montage between the two of them, set to Michael Jackson's ""Beat It"" is my favorite moment--a very funny scene which is very well choreographed.  Of course, Stiller has to give his wife Christine Taylor a significant role.  All I gotta say is Ben--you're a lucky man!  Christine is a very beautiful woman, and a charming actress to boot.  Will Ferrell is one of today's best comic actors--capable of making almost scene work with his magical schtick.  I just wish he could've had more screen time as the villain Mugato.  He's one of those comic actors who can make an audience laugh with a simple facial expression.  The soundtrack is great, including such great 80s hits as ""Working for the Weekends"" and ""Wake Me Up Before You Go Go.""  ""Zoolander"" is not a great movie, nor a hysterically funny one, but it's worth renting and does have its moments.  My score:  6 (out of 10)",Zoolander
75,jhclues,Ben Stiller Delivers A Classic Comedy,10,6 October 2001,"The complex world of the male modeling profession, including the inherent rivalries and the significant impact the industry has had on history is explored and revealed in `Zoolander,' a brilliant comedy directed by and starring the versatile Ben Stiller.  With chiseled features that bespeak the best of Michelangelo, as well as an arsenal of three `looks,' preeminent of which is the riveting `Blue Steel,' Derek Zoolander (Stiller) is poised to win the coveted VH-1 Male Model of the Year Award for an unprecedented fourth year in a row.  But this year-- for the first time-- he has a rival, a newcomer, who just may be able to usurp his title:  the charismatic and popular Hansel (Owen Wilson), who-- with chiseled features of his own-- has burst upon the scene only this year and threatens to steal Zoolander's thunder in one fell swoop.  And as if this wasn't enough for the seemingly (until now) invulnerable Zoolander to have on his vapid mind, a reporter for Time Magazine, Matilda Jeffries (Christine Taylor-- Stiller's real-life wife), has written an in-depth article about him in which the true nature of the man behind the Adonis is objectively and succinctly revealed, and it's scheduled to hit the streets the week of the Awards.  Suffice to say it's a full plate for Derek Zoolander, male model, who-- unbeknownst to him-- has yet an even greater personal vexation awaiting, which involves a sinister plot and the Prime Minister of Malaysia.  The Prime Minister of Malaysia? And what-- you may ask-- does that have to do with the male modeling profession?  Well, it's just that kind of movie...Like a toothless attack dog that suddenly lunges at you and chomps down on your elbow, `Zoolander' has a harmless bite that will grab your attention immediately and refuse to let you go.  And like that dog it will continue to gum your elbow until it tickles your funny-bone and you become helpless to do anything other than pet it on the head and want to take it home with you. That's the effect of Stiller's film.  It's an hilarious excursion through a world in which glitz, glamor and good-looks are the commandments by which to live, and one-on-one `walk-offs' and break dance fighting are the realities which mask a degree of shallowness that is nearly unfathomable.  All of which Stiller delivers in his own inimitable style, with subtle nuance and an instinctive sense of comedy that really makes this satire work.  No one-- with the possible exception of Albert Brooks-- can set up a comedy and put it across as effectively as Stiller, who always plays it straight and never fishes for `cheap' laughs.  What he gives you is the real deal, and it's classic.In Derek Zoolander, Stiller has created a character who manifests the myriad facets, ironies and idiosyncrasies of pop culture, offering a perspective that allows us to laugh, not only at Zoolander, but at ourselves, as well.  And such a perspective is a rare and welcomed gift; for too often matters of insignificance are taken too seriously by too many, and it is at such times that we need a Zoolander among us to dispel the complexities we foist upon ourselves and to negate the self-imposed burdens that keep us in thrall to the most trivial things in life.  Zoolander holds up a mirror and points out the furrow in your brow that simply doesn't have to be there.  Stiller is a truly gifted artist who can make you laugh, think and feel good about yourself all at the same time.  But like Chaplin and Fields before him, it will undoubtedly-- and unfortunately-- be some time before his true genius is widely and sufficiently recognized.Owen Wilson, as well, is a talented actor/writer/performer who has demonstrated his own unique style in such films as `Bottle Rocket,' `Shanghai Noon' and `Meet the Parents,' and here makes Hansel the perfect counterpart of Derek Zoolander.  Hansel is the flip side of the same coin that carries the likeness of Zoolander; so different, yet cut from the same cloth.  And, like Stiller, Wilson plays it straight, with a subtle delivery that is entirely effective.  He and Stiller, in fact, are possibly the greatest comed-team-who-aren't-a-team in the history of the movies.  Wilson has the driest delivery this side of Gene Wilder, his timing is perfect and his quirky looks and the timbre of his voice give him a veritably captivating screen presence.  He brings Hansel to life with facility, and makes him a memorable character.The supporting cast includes Will Ferrell (Mugatu), Jerry Stiller (Ballstein), Milla Jovovich (Katinka), Matt Levin (Archie) and features cameos by David Duchovny, Cuba Gooding Jr., Lenny Kravitz, Vince Vaughn, Jon Voight, Billy Zane, Natalie Portman, Winona Ryder, David Bowie, Andy Dick and Fabio.  Already the second-greatest cult film of all time (behind Stiller's `Mystery Men'), `Zoolander,' like Stiller himself, is destined to be initially under appreciated, but in time will be recognized as the comedic masterpiece that it is.  It's entertaining and funny, at times dark, but never offensive; and it's the kind of film that gets even better with repeated viewings.  A true classic that will endure the test of time, this film is what the magic of the movies is all about, and one you do not want to miss.  I rate this one 10/10.",Zoolander
76,phubbs,Zoolander,6,22 December 2013,"This was the first film to really introduce me to Will Ferrell back in the day, its hard to think when this film came out he wasn't a big name star. Twas also the first time I saw Ben Stiller's dad on the big screen, or anywhere really, I hadn't yet discovered the joys of 'The King of Queens'.This entire film plays out like an early Sacha Baron Cohen flick ('Bruno') but much much tamer. A very deliberate spoof and parody of the fashion/model world that is grotesque, bloated, narcissistic and embarrassing. Alongside Stiller and Owen Wilson is fellow frat pack member Vince Vaughn in an early cameo role and many many other big name stars hamming it up...or so we're led to believe.Of course this being a film about modelling and fashion there has to be real patriots of this exclusive world involved, and there are plenty. All the big glamorous names you can think of that are connected to this vomit inducing scene are hauled out in front of the camera to show us their parody acting chops. Thing is I'm not entirely sure some of them understood they were being put in a film, I highly doubt they caught on that their lives were being poked fun at (mocked) and they were contributing towards the laughs. Just another day in the glitzy limelight for them.I wouldn't say the humour was particularly clever, witty or sharp. Its most definitely amusing seeing Stiller and Wilson going overboard as two self obsessed male models, the clip montages at the award ceremony, their own unique dialect and visual expressions plus the 'walk off'...some great mockery going on there. Unfortunately it doesn't quite hold up for the run time in my opinion, the early golden moments dry up quickly as do the ideas.The plot is daft of course but that doesn't matter really, its just a chance to have a pop at this ridiculous industry, maybe open some insider eyes perhaps. It all feels like your typical SNL sketch that has been stretched out but a little better than their usual fare. Its all very predictable childish and silly but that's the idea so there's no need to think into it. The only good thing about the film for me was the main lead duo and their excellent self indulgent portrayals, everything else is so so.I totally forgot how hot Jovovich is in this film with her strict dominatrix attire, plus talk about a desperate attempt to kick start your career Billy Zane!.

Many performances of his have always been fairly repetitive, however with the type of jokes encoded and his direction does it come off and with the support, can we see a true energetic performance. The quality of direction is good, using a variety of shots and techniques to get the weird and wonderful messages across.Successful support is given by Owen Wilson (Wedding crashers) and Will Ferrell (Blades of Glory) all comedians with a similar style and combining recognized comedy actors justifies the genre and gives a clear message to audience about the life of these characters.Though the plot is predictable, daft and utterly a bizarre portrayal of what really happens in the fashion industry, you just have to sit back and enjoy it anyway. Too many films these days, particularly comedies, are made with no depth and hardly any funny jokes and predictable written underneath the title, for example The Heartbreak Kid. But sometimes they work, this script is sharp, and actually is funny with physical and other types of humour used to justify the needs of the viewing public, bring back this style of comedy.There will be shaking of the head moments and turning to look at the wall when one of the clichés appear but for the most part, Zoolander is sharply written, a completely daft yet enjoyable comedy that does work and is perhaps the best performance by Stiller in his long and established career.",Zoolander

Zoolander is not supposed to make a lasting impression; it's flimsy, 90-minute escapism. Though I didn't laugh very much in this nonsensical comedy either, although it does contain some funny material involving the title character's stupidity, and it benefits from keeping its tongue firmly in cheek.Following the success of his blockbuster comedies ""Meet the Parents"" and ""There's Something About Mary,"" Ben Stiller gathered family and friends to make Zoolander, an original, stylish satire on the fashion industry. Based on a 1996 VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards character Stiller co-created with MTV Movie Awards writer/producer Drake Sather, Zoolander is quite pleased with its unique sense of humor, but unique does not necessarily spell funny.Stiller plays Derek Zoolander, who has defended his title of Male Model of the Year for three consecutive years now, but this year his competition gets the best of him. A dashing, red-hot newcomer, Hansel (Owen Wilson) nabs the award, sending Zoolander home with nothing but a low self-image. Shocked by these and other tragic events, Derek wonders if there's more to life than being ""really, really good looking."" He returns to his Southern roots only for his coal miner father (Jon Voight) to disown him. Enter a diabolical plot to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia, and you have yourself the visually amusing concept of Zoolander.Ben Stiller has the stuff here, as does Owen Wilson, Jon Voight, SNL veteran Will Ferrell, Jerry Stiller, and Milla Jovovich. I especially enjoyed the charismatic performance by Ben Stiller's real life wife, Christine Taylor as an aggressive Time Magazine Reporter. Andy Dick, Fabio, Cuba Gooding Jr., Donald Trump, Natalie Portman, Winona Ryder, Billy Zane, and Garry Shandling and other big stars appear for satiric cameos. There's a lot of talent involved with this film, which makes it all the more tragic that it doesn't work.Ben Stiller, who also directs, writes, and producers this movie, has a lot of fun. During pre-production, Stiller and Owen Wilson spent two days being photographed by Frank Ockenfels to create model ""portfolios"" for Zoolander and Hansel. They posed in mock ad campaigns for Gucci, Perry Ellis, Tommy Hilfiger and Evian, as well as bogus magazine covers for GQ, Details, Rolling Stone, Surfer, American Way, ESPN and the International Male catalog.Filmed in New York City and Los Angeles, the film creates an enjoyable world of glamorous fashion fiction. Production designer Robin Standefer and costume designer David C. Robinson imagine lush, outrageous, exotic costumes and images that greatly contribute to character development. Even with such a complex visual arena, however, Zoolander flops. It's visually entertaining, yes, but the story is not interesting, the characters one-dimensional, and the attempt at humor only occasionally makes us grimace. It's dazzling, flavorful candy for our eyes, but Zoolander is all style without substance.",Zoolander

This is a clever, original and a just simply great movie.",10,1 December 2001,"Derek Zoolander is a top male super-model, who has won the VH1 'Male Model of the Year' award three times. On his fourth year of being nominated Derek expects to win, but unfortunately he doesn't. Instead new model on the block, Hansel, is the one who gets the award. After his fall, Derek then decides to quit the world of modelling and decides to go and find his family, his father and two brothers who all work at a cole-mine. Things aren't going well for a while, until things begin to look up when strange designer Mugatu offers Zoolander a chance to make a comeback in the model world with his new 'Derelicte' Line. What Zoolander and nobody else realise at first is that Mugatu plans to use Zoolander in his plan to assassinate the new Malaysian Prime Minister on his visit to New York, by brainwashing him with the help of his horrible assistant Katinka. Time Magazine journalist Matilda is the one who finds out about the planned assassination and is the one, with the help of Hansel, who helps Zoolander to stop Mugatu from doing this awful thing.As well as starring in the movie, Ben Stiller also directs and writes the screenplay. Real life father Jerry Stiller also stars here and he's great as usual. Stiller's real life wife, Christine Taylor also has a part in here too. Owen Wilson gives quite a good performance too. There are LOADS of cool cameos in the movie too from the likes of Natalie Portman, Winona Ryder, David Duchovny and Jon Voight. Zoolander is definitely different to many of Ben Stiller's other movies, but with Stiller anything is enjoyable. He's simply one of the best comedy actors, writers, etc. around. There are some really funny moments here in the movie too, most with Stiller and the movie is very clever. I think it would be great if they made a sequel to this cool, original movie.",Zoolander

This movie is a VERY bizarre movie, the comedy is just STUPID, but HILARIOUS!!!  There are a few scenes in particular that make me laugh just thinking about them.  There are undoubtably people that are going to hate this sort of comedy, but I thought it was hilarious.  I just love the absurdity of the jokes and the characters.  Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson are a great team, and I can't wait to see their next joint effort.  Will Ferrell and Christine Taylor also pull off a great performance as well.

94,EmperorNortonII,Fashionably Funny,8,6 October 2001,"I found ""Zoolander"" very funny.  It's also clever in it's silly way.  Ben Stiller plays Derek Zoolander as a monumentally stupid male model.  What can you say about a man who pours so much energy into perfecting facial expressions that more or less all look the same?  And Will Ferrell does a good job as Mugatu, the outrageous villain.  The best scene is the ""walk-off"" between Derek and Hansel, which is probably the funniest duel in movies today.  The whole thing was a flamboyant and hilarious turn on the catwalk!",Zoolander
95,SquigglyCrunch,Both the Greatest and the Dumbest Comedy Ever Made,7,25 May 2016,"Zoolander follows the male model Derek Zoolander as he embarks on a journey to discover who he truly is and is ultimately manipulated into doing something evil for the sake of another person. That plot synopsis was not very good, but with a movie like this it's hard to get one that is. Zoolander is a very odd movie. The humor is very goofy and dumb, but it's also very good and pretty clever at times. It's easy to laugh at and enjoy, and it truly is just a weird movie. As far as character depth and plot development goes, this movie does lack. It doesn't show during the movie because it's clear that this is kind of it's intention. It's not trying to be a masterpiece, it's just trying to make you laugh. And it does just that. I don't wish that it'd been deeper or anything, either. With a movie like this that simply wouldn't make any sense. Every time it did 'go deeper' that moment was immediately shot down by some goofy joke, further proving that the movie was trying to be anything but deep or emotional.Overall Zoolander is a lot of fun. It's very funny in a dumb and goofy way. While nothing about it is particularly deep or developed, it's clear that it's not supposed to be. And that's not a bad thing. It was made to entertain and that's what it did. In the end I would recommend this movie.",Zoolander
96,christophe92300,Mediocre,4,4 June 2013,"As a lot of comedies, Zoolander is disappointing and doesn't live up to the expectation.The story is rather enjoyable to follow and the fashion theme was interesting and had potential, but it isn't crazy enough and the gags, too rare and not enough striking, struggle to crack the viewer a smile which is prohibitive for a comedy, some are actually really bad.Apart from Mugatu played by the inevitable and always excellent Will Ferrell, the characters lack consistency, a characteristic that, in the end, applies well to the movie in its entirety.

97,shark-43,One Joke Movie,3,21 October 2001,"I was very disappointed with ZOOLANDER. I like Ben Stiller's work, but the movie really just had the same joke over and over; male models are dumb and pop culture is transparent. And by trying to hang some MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE plotline around such a flimsy movie idea to begin with, well it sunk fast. Yes, there are some laughs and even some clever scenes, but Derek Zoolander is such a dim, sullen lead character all it does is remind you whatan amazing feat AUSTIN POWERS really was. Thismovie wanted to try and pull off a satricial bullseye like that film but I feel it really missed it's mark and one of thebig problems was that Stiller decided to direct it himself. The man is not a director. He is a fine actor, a good writer, but his three movies (REALITY BITES, CABLE GUY and now this) well they are patchy messes with no real rhythm or sense of honesty to them. As an actor, Stiller has never been better than in FLIRTING WITH DISASTER. But, Zoolander is like the lead - all one look, nothing else. BLAH!!!",Zoolander
98,beresfordjd,It misses on every level,1,8 June 2009,"I have tried to watch this movie about 4 times now. I thought maybe I didn't ""get"" it. I realise that I do get it though and I don't want it. I find that Ben Stiller is one of the most irritating ""comic"" actors . He is overrated to a ridiculous degree. He tried to blame the original failure at the box office on the fact it was released just before 9/11 but that is a cop-out. The script is painfully unfunny and stuffing a film with cameos only serves as a prop to hold up the weakness of the whole venture. I tried to concentrate on it but there was really nothing to watch. Kudos to the filmmakers for being able to get so many stars to appear in it but that is really not enough to save it. I managed to get through 30 minutes this time before I thought to myself, ""Do you really want to waste minutes of your precious life watching this pile of faeces?"" I came to the conclusion that I did not. As for Stiller-wake up people the Emperor has no clothes. Just because he has connections to ""show biz"" through his family was never any reason to laud him as a comic genius. Do NOT get me started with Will Ferrell either!! Owen Wilson has made lots of stinkers too but somehow I find him more appealing than Stiller on every level.There is not even a smile in this film let alone any laughs.",Zoolander

102,moviemanMA,Never before has male modeling been so hilarious!,7,30 July 2005,"Everyone has seen a male model before whether it's on the side of a bus, in a magazine, or on TV. They are the icons of glamour, good looks, and power. They have the power to persuade a person to buy a product. But what really goes on in the life of a male model? Well, this movie probably gives the most ridiculous answer...but it doesn't matter.Zoolander is about a male model named Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller), who is famous for his looks called Blue Steel, Ferrari, and his best kept secret...Magnum. All together they are the same look; sunken cheeks, puckered lips, and eyes that could look through walls. Derek is on top of the modeling world, winning awards, getting the best designers, and not knowing what is going on. His world and the entire modeling scene are about to be rocked by the rising star Hansel (Owen Wilson) who is now considered the top model over Derek. Derek doesn't realize this until it's much too late.Behind these heroes of the runway are the designers like Maury Ballstein (Jerry Stiller) and Mugatu (Will Ferrell). In wake of Derek's model friend's dreadful gasoline fight that went wrong, Derek has retired. Mugatu's plan is to trick Derek into modeling for his new line of clothing and at the same time be brainwashed into killing the Malaysian Prime Minister because he has closed down Mugatu's child labor factory. Derek is torn between modeling and helping a beautiful reporter named Matilda (Christine Taylor) get her story on Mugatu and working for Mugatu to get back at Hansel.The movie is very entertaining with all of it's characters and storyline. Stiller is priceless as the 'no so bright' Zoolander and his performance is complimented by Wilson and Ferrell. Of course Ben brings all of his friends into the movie. Wilson and Ferrell have parts and as does buddy Vince Vaughn as his brother. This group of comedy kings have been making movies together for a while now and the hits just keep on coming. With other members of the ""Laugh Pack"" here and there (like Luke Wilson), their movies will always keep the laughs coming.Zoolander is a great movie to watch anytime. It really does make you laugh. Watching Stiller, Willson, and Ferrell work their magic is a wonderful thing. Just like his father, Ben is a laugh riot. His father Jerry also holds his own in this film. Stiller delivers once again. All together, Zoolander walks the walk and talks the talk.",Zoolander
103,AvidClimber,Zoolander — Making fun of the fashion industry and male models for a good laugh,7,8 February 2013,"Zoolander is not the type of movie you like instantly, it's the kind that grows on you. The more you see it, the funnier it gets. The piece is not kind on the fashion industry and least of all on male models, but it's fun as hell.It's difficult to explain what is good about it when you can't name any single aspect as a commanding thread. The enjoyment itself derives from a number of little things. The whole walk-off scene is a good example. The editing isn't miraculous but it's right. The music isn't perfect, but it's good. The acting isn't superb, but it works well. It's the meshing of every little pieces that makes that scene and its sarcasm totally hilarious.You want to see something offbeat, with odd humor, a silly story, and plenty of caricatures? This is probably a good movie for you.",Zoolander
104,Flagrant-Baronessa,Dethrones 'Dumb and Dumber' as the most pointless comedy ever made,6,30 July 2006,"Don't get me wrong, I love D&D, but Zoolander just about surpasses this film in sheer pointlessness and brainless jokes. It has beyond wacky performances, escalating stupidity and it features some truly cringe-worthy moments. It is just completely and utterly insane, brainless to the core.Zoolander is based off some VH-1 spoof about male models and it takes this idea much further by bringing these stereotypically dumb characters to life in the form of Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) and Hansel (Owen Wilson), competing against each other on the runway but having to team up eventually in order to stop the evil plans of the prime minister of Malaysia (Will Ferrell). I don't think I could give out spoilers if I wanted to, because the plot of the film is thinner than an Olsen twin. It all fits in the zany world of Zoolander.So this film would pretty much be the prototype of bad cinema, but sometimes comes a joke in Zoolander that is just so hysterical that it totally takes you by surprise. This is stuff like a bunch of male models hanging out and PLAYING WITH GASOLINE and one of them lighting a cigarette and KA-BOOM!. Or the ""walk-off"" on the runway between Zoolander and Hansel. Or best of all, the multitude of random cameos by famous actors like Billy Zane, David Duchovny, Donald Trump (ok, so not an actor, but still!), Paris Hilton, Natalie Portman and Christian Slater.Still, you have got to credit a film that has nothing to say, no statements to make, no messages to convey -- it doesn't pretend to be something it's not -- it's just a gloriously entertaining and colourful comedy. Remember, a 'Bad' movie can still be fun to watch.6/10",Zoolander
105,willcundallreview,A firm type of pretty good comedy,7,29 March 2014,"Rating-7/10Zoolander is a funny comedy with jokes that can truly make you chuckle, but they and the film are very silly. The film bumps along nicely and with some great cast members you feel maybe it could have been better, but it definitely not a poor film at all. I personally felt it was a Firmly Kind of Good film and would recommend it to anyone, here below is why I feel you should watch it, even if it isn't an awesome comedy.The story is a fun one and with all the fashion spoofing going on I could say this was made for those who like fashion, or maybe the film takes the mick, well in any case the story is funny and fits jokes in here and there among a plot that is absurd but fun of course. It can have it's less than funny parts which could be said ruin the film seeing as it is a comedy but I will overlook them and just say it is pretty good.Ben Stiller in the lead is dumb, which is good of course as his character is insanely stupid, and with Owen Wilson backing up in a funny role too, they both together can be great rivals. I did feel that Will Ferrell was underused in this film and was made to be an unfunny character that had a lot more potential for laughs. One last thing on the cast is with Milla Jovovich who although isn't so much funny in this, she creates a superbly sinister villain who can be stupid too but when is serious is kind of scary.The script actually isn't the most funny part of the film with a lot of physical humour used throughout, so I guess praise has to be given Ben Stiller again who as star, director and writer does a fantastic job considering he was on his own for most of this. I enjoyed the sets which are big and vibrant and make for a nice looking film with interesting things going on, the entire production looks great though, and of course the crazy outfits are probably the most defining thing about this piece.Negativity comes in the shape of missed jokes which of course are annoying because they are just not funny, now although I believe the majority of jokes were good some missed the mark a lot and maybe pushed this down just ever so slightly. I felt although the only criticism from me was missed jokes, some others will hate the more slower parts of the film that slow down the pace of the movie which for the most is fast.People who like Ben Stiller will like this as well, this is his flagship movie maybe and his traits of humour used in others is plainly seen in this. Comedy lovers will maybe like this, its maybe not the crudest film ever but contains some nonetheless. This is isn't for those who consider themselves more classy comedy fans as the film is silly, funny, but silly also but I do think it can be enjoyed even if you don't laugh once at it.Overall I give this a 7/10 as I felt it was Firmly Good, although definitely not a GOOD film, it isn't just OK and you can truly and really enjoy this. Maybe be in the right mood to watch it as it can be annoying I would bet if you were in a sad or angry mood but same goes for so many others. Just enjoy it though as I say, it is silly as I also said but maybe you will like it, and if you like this movie, there are many movies like this too.",Zoolander
106,Cinemaniac1984,You'll either like Zoolander or hate it. What you see is what you get.,5,5 September 2015,"Zoolander is one of those popular comedies that have divided many audiences. Most people will either like Zoolander and enjoy themselves, others may find it average, and other may say Zoolander is an overrated comedy and dislike it to bits. I thought it was disappointing and overrated, although there were some funny moments.Basically Zoolander is about dimwitted male model Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) who has lost his crown as #1 male model to the brash Hansel (Owen Wilson). Derek Zoolander finds that his fame, friends and fortune disappear until Mugatu (Will Farrell) hires Zoolander to turn his career around but instead brainwashes him to assassinate the Prime Minister of Malaysia. Can Zoolander prevent the incident as well as recapture his fame? The movie also has an all star cast including Christine Taylor (Ben Stiller's wife), Jerry Stiller (Ben Stiller's father in real life), David Duchovny, Jon Voight, Milla Jovovich, and a non-stop array of cameos including Donald Trump, Christian Slater, Heidi Klum, Paris Hilton, Claudia Schiffer and many more celebrities who appear as themselves.Basically to sum up Zoolander, what you see is what you get. You can enjoy yourself and leave your brain at the door, or you may not care for it at all.

108,pfgpowell-1,Inspired silliness and some good jokes,6,8 August 2010,"The celebrated Roger Ebert, in his review of Zoolander — written in 2001, just after 9/11 — got rather sniffy about the assassination of 'the Prime Minister of Malaysia' being at the centre of the film's plot. He's right, of course, that it is in bad taste (and he also takes the producers to task for not even listing the name of the Asian actor who played the Prime Minister), I suggest he is being oversensitive. He makes the point that the producers might easily have simply invented an Asian country (the film involves a conspiracy by the world's leading fashion designers to sabotage a bid to outlaw child labour which the fashion industry relies to make fabulous profits), but in the grand scheme of things I really don't feel Zoolander disgraces itself by its lapse into poor taste. Jonathan Swift was guilty of even worse bad taste in his Modest Proposal in which he suggested famine in Ireland could be solved if the Irish ate their children, so Ben Stiller et al find themselves in luminous company. Not that Zoolander is great satire, but it takes a great many potshots at the fashion industry and scores a great many direct hits. Zoolander has some inspired silliness and straddles the divide between dumb comedy movies and outright satire rather well. It has nothing to be ashamed about and a lot of which to be proud. You could do a lot worse than Zoolander (and probably have done so, several times). Just sit back and enjoy some very silly jokes. NB I can think of no reason at all why Stiller called the main character 'Zoolander'. It seems to be in some way significant, but how I really don't know. Perhaps it is an in-joke.",Zoolander

Here Stiller is Derek Zoolander, male model, and supposedly really really ridiculously good looking, unlikely premise right there, but stick with it as it's all ironic, and comedy, and whilst it's all tongue in cheek there are a few messages in there. Owen Wilson is great in Zoolander as Hansel, Derek's main modelling rival, and just a lot of fun, and there's so many familiar faces and big names Will Ferrel, Jon Voight, Vince Vaughn, Billy Zane and David ""old school rules"" Bowie etc and Stiler-film regular Christine Taylor as the Journalist and also Ben's father Jerry as Maury Ballstein, Zoolander's agent. Lovely little role for gorgeous David Duchovny as JP Prewitt, hand model.It's like a fairytale, or morality tale, and whilst it's not rocket science it's witty and smart and gains on duplicate viewing with plenty of other jokes you might have missed.

Forget about Citizen Kane, Casablanca, The Godfather, Rear Window, forget them. Forget contemporary classics like Pulp Fiction, The Dark Knight, There Will Be Blood, Memento. Ben Stiller did the greatest film of all times here, without a shadow of doubt. Saying otherwise means that you suffered a brainwash, even more evilesque than the one Zoolander suffered. In fact, Will Ferrell dancing and yelling 'kill the Malaysian leader!' with a blue background would look like a good dream, compared with the brainwash you suffered. Even more, dare I say.This film, vastly underrated, deserves at least one Oscar by year only for homages. Ben Stiller deserved the Nobel for Human Sciences here, and also a Nobel of literature, obviously by helping to create a script that could easily beat any book created by Freud, Dostoyevsky or Shakespeare. He deserves. I am afraid that I'm going to watch Zoolander for the rest of my life, because there is no piece of cinema made before, after or whats ever worth watching after that. Bravo!

Stiller as a writer and director comes off as snippy and itching to degrade the modeling profession for no apparent reason other than its availability as a target; he wants us to share his hostility but there's nothing compelling as to why we should. As the star, he's almost acceptable as a vain, dumb supermodel (let's not fool ourselves about his looks) but his co-star Owen Wilson has the image down pat and subtly provides most of the humor here, though the real-life cameos (which have become de rigueur for this kind of picture) are also a lot of fun. Stiller continues to mine familiar terrain, but this time, rather than dwelling on the Farrelly Brothers' turf, he invades `Austin Powers' territory and the result is inconsequential.",Zoolander
116,troyputland,"Stupid, but funny.",6,20 February 2016,"Zoolander is as silly as it is funny. Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) is a fashion icon who's stupidity matches his Blue Steel looks. His competition, Hansel (Owen Wilson) ends up winning VH1's model of the year award, beating Derek to a fourth time. A small blip in Derek's career throws him off the rails. It's all hilariously ludicrous, and it (almost) pains me to admit, because this comedy is quite an average film made good by its gags and cameos. Zoolander's brain-washed, by the evil guru Mugatu (Will Ferrell), to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia. Take it with a pinch of salt, there's much to enjoy if the mind's in the right place, with the fashion face-off between Derek and Hansel, and Derek's accidental award pick-up standing out the most.",Zoolander
117,dommercaldi,"Typical Goofy 2000's Comedy That Is Enjoyable, But Contains Many Flaws And Little Substance",6,2 January 2021,"Pros:
1. The soundtrack is full of classics and it also adds an upbeat lively feel to the movie.
2. The in-your-face and kooky costume design not encapsulates the essence of a lot of the characters, but also the film in general.
3. Both Ben Stiller (Derek Zoolander) and Owen Wilson (Hansel) deliver great performances.
4. The humour is utterly hilarious and is bolstered by Ben Stiller's excellent comedic timing.Cons:
1. There are a plethora of distracting celebrity cameos, from the likes of Fred Durst, Donald Trump, Gwen Stefani, and many more, and they only bring the viewer out of the film.
2. It doesn't make sense why Mugatu (Will Ferrell) needs an idiot for a short-notice job, thus it's obviously a cheap plot device for the subsequent events to occur.
3. Matilda Jeffries (Christine Taylor) is a bit of a none character and merely serves as a needless love interest for Derek Zoolander, as well as most of her scenes revolving around her helping him.
4. The third act drags a little with pointless, or pointlessly extended, scenes. For example, the love-making scene.
5. There are a few moments of clunky editing, with eye-sore slow-motion and irritating fast cuts.",Zoolander
118,D_Burke,Incredibly Funny Comedy- Still One of Ben Stiller's Best,8,24 January 2009,"""Zoolander"" holds a special place in my heart because it was the first theatrically released film I saw after 9/11. It was just one of those laugh-out-loud movies I needed to see, although I didn't know it when I paid for my movie ticket. I just came to the movie theater not expecting much other than a few pretty-good trailers I saw online, and ended up nearly falling out of my seat laughing at the sheer ridiculousness of it.Ben Stiller really nails the character of Derek Zoolander and doesn't miss a beat. Zoolander is an incredibly ignorant individual, but not entirely stupid. His intentions are good, although sometimes misguided, and it makes for some really good comedy. The scene where he throws the miniature model of a building to the ground is still absolutely funny even though I know the scene by heart. Stiller really takes that scene and sells it.Christine Taylor is also incredibly good in her role. This was probably the role for her where she stopped being known as ""the woman who played Marsha Brady in the movies"", yet her resemblance to Maureen McCormack is still very striking. No matter, she played someone who was convincingly smart, and she played a great straight man (or woman) to Stiller and the equally ignorant Owen Wilson.Was this film perfect? Of course not, but I still liked it better than many film critics did at the time. Richard Roeper, a film critic whom I usually agree with, hated this film. Roeper said that the film made fun of male models when they really make fun of themselves in reality, using Fabio as an example. However, I saw this film not so much making fun of male models specifically, or even models themselves, but more the fashion industry and its seemingly self-centered nature. I also thought it was a great and unexpected way for VH1, who partially produced the film, to make fun of their pre-""I Love The '80's"" image. Sure, the celebrity cameos were a bit much at times, but they really didn't overshadow the overall humor and appeal of the movie (at least not to this reviewer).The other problem critics had with this movie was using Malasia as a major plot point, and not a fictional country. In reality, Malasia has been democratic for decades, and is considered a U.S. ally. The critics probably have a point here, but at the same time, Malasia wasn't being made fun of in this movie, nor were there any hurtful, low-brow attempts at humor through racial stereotyping. Using a fictional country probably would have been better, but no movie is perfect.Despite the bad reviews, ""Zoolander"" went on to find an audience, particularly when it was released on video. I hear people my age quoting lines from the movie all the time, and the main people in the cast have gone on to bigger and better things. It's just that funny a movie, and I'm glad I'm not the only person that thinks so.",Zoolander
119,tributarystu,It's a strange world...our world?,7,7 September 2003,"I saw Zoolander the second time a few nights ago and wondered why I had initially awarded this movie merely a six. If we regard this movie seriously, yeah, sure, a six would be enough. But it's not about serious or not, it's about fun and laughing. It exceeded my expectations in these regards. Ben Stiller has always been one of my favorite comedy actors because he's got that look on his face, a warm and friendly look, that can easily make you laugh. This certainly isn't one of his best movies, but it's a good one.
minor SPOILERSIt's the world of fashion, the world of ""male modeling""(not something I look to with much interest), the world of brainless hunks of muscles. It's our world with some tiny, tiny exaggerations. Ok...maybe not so tiny. The story is stupidly funny, this affirmation being valid for the whole movie. It's so stupid and yet so funny. I don't usually love stupid comedies, but this one is an exception, maybe because it seems to be a small universe within our world, a serious and always changing world. You can't really say that Derek's looks change too often, do they? The fact that Derek is searching to find out other things to do beside modeling, something with which he can help humanity, is hilarious through the fact that his desires are of such infantile and sincere stupidity. It's no wonder in the end that his center for children who can't read too well actually transforms into a center for the ""to be"" models. The movie is stupid, but fun. I can say that the modeling world is a world within our world and this is vividly shown in the movie. Owen Wilson plays the a little bit brighter ""enemy"" of Derek, concerning the modeling stage. Milla Jovovich plays the ferocious woman with a...remarkable name, who has to take control over Derek. She could've been a little more impressive though. This being the debut for Stiller in the directing world, it's good. If you ever get the chance to see it, don't avoid it. 7.5/10",Zoolander

This movie is funny.  Ben Stiller is good as the idiotic Derek Zoolander.  Owen Wilson does great as Hansel, also an idiot male model. Christine taylor is very hot and she did very good in this, too.  I'm surprised they didn't nominate Jon Voight for an Academy Award for this (sarcasm).  they nominated for Ali, and his part wasn't that big.

121,HenryHextonEsq,A vanity project lacking basis.,4,13 December 2001,"Seeing that Ben Stiller directed, co-wrote, co-produced and starred in this film, one would think there'd be some ""personal vision"" in evidence, but alas, Stiller seems to be no auteur. This is a light, insubstantial sprinkling of dressing, lacking a main course. As the venerable John says below, the film is much like a few episodes loosely put together by a bunch of friends. Stiller really does impose no proper structure upon this film; it does seem more like a half-baked ""TV special"" than a film.
Most tellingly perhaps, Stiller's main character is a truly unsubtle stereotype, far from funny himself, or even when used as comic fall guy. The character is plain irritating; Stiller seems to think a few gormless mannerisms and a silly voice are enough; frankly, they are not. Tellingly, one can never quite sympathize with this ""character"".Overall, a bad film, which was watchable, just about, if cringeworthily cliched a lot of the time.

I mean I must have laughed around 35 times during the movie and Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller just raise that bar of comedy in this one. They were good in other movies, but this one is by far their absolute best. Now this movie is about stuck up male model Derek Zoolander(Ben Stiller) who is a stupid person who's won the best Male Model award 3 times in a row before coming second in a run for the fourth by Hansel(Owen Wilson), another Stupid guy.

124,Christopher_Reid,A cult classic of the stupid comedy genre.,8,21 May 2007,"In 2001, the stupid-comedy sub genre of film was changed forever by one film. That film was Zoolander, which has since become one of the most commonly quoted/referenced films among the growing number of people that have been affected by it. Never before had a comedy at this level of stupidity been attempted. In its dumbest moments, Zoolander is second to none. Where Zoolander lags is in its attempts to develop a meaningful plot and moral to the story. Luckily, this is not often and the result is a classic with countless unforgettable moments.I think Zoolander owes the majority of its greatness to its actors as opposed to the writing or directing for example, which are quite inventive at times but otherwise nothing special. Owen Wilson is arguably the heart of the film although Will Ferrel, Jerry Stiller and of course Ben Stiller have their moments. The numerous cameo appearances (most notably David Duchovny and David Bowie) also turn out to be well executed opportunities for hilarity.Now, I don't think there's much more I can really say about Zoolander. Some people might not like it but then they obviously just don't get it. Perhaps they just need to carefully consider the question ""But why male models?"" one more time and then finally they will appreciate the inevitably apparent fact that ""Dear God ... it's beautiful.""",Zoolander

Not usually a fan of Owew Wilson or Will Ferrall, but I enjoyed their characters. Ferrall's Mugatu was the best character of the film.There were a few nice zings at our image obsessed culture, the ridiculous nature of ""fashion"" and at the clothing industry's use of child labor/sweatshops.My biggest disappointment was the dismissal of the reporters feelings. Her disgust with male models can all be explained away by the fact that she used to be fat? And the gang-bang was in seriously poor taste. (you can tell this film was written by guys).I thought the cameos were pointless, though having David Bowie judge a ""walk off"" fit nicely and David Duchovny's bit was funny.So if you're in the mood for something brainless, this isn't bad.

One particular excellent scene is when the three models die in a ""freak gasoline fight accident.""

It is pretty accurate and dead-on, but it never goes too far. Unfortunately, from an outside perspective, the movie is too stupid for its own good. You will feel your IQ dropping and you will not like it. Stiller played more for honesty and accuracy about modeling and believe me, that's too much of a stretch.Derek Zoolander is finished in the male model world. When he gets a new contract from an evil agent, he's unknowingly brainwashed into finding and assassinating the prime minister of Malaysia.The movie sucks really. Between the orgy scenes, the movie references of some classics, walk-offs(!), none of it makes sense. It's all a joke. If you can deposit your mind in a safe deposit box for a couple years, forget all the vestiges of your sanity and you finally watch this, there probably still will be enough spark there to ask yourself, ""What the heck am I watching?""

Stiller plays it a little over the top, but it works. Stiller makes us feel what Derek Zoolander feels even though we as audience are much smarter than Zoolander.Owen Wilson plays Hansel, a new up and coming model who becomes a rival of Zoolander's but then they become best friends.

134,crculver,A critique of designer fashion and America's image-focused celebrity culture where the not-particularly-glamorous Ben Stiller has fun playing a male model,4,22 August 2015,"The 2001 film ZOOLANDER is a comedy about two male models, the eminent Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) and the up-and-coming Hansel (Owen Wilson), who with the help of an investigative reporter (Christine Taylor) must thwart the plans of a megalomaniac fashion designer (Will Ferrell) to maintain third-world child sweatshop labour. Most of the humour in the film comes from Stiller's portrayal of Zoolander, a dimwitted manchild with a heart of gold, and the fact that the actor playing this male model isn't remotely glamorous. Hansel is an exaggeratedly alternative guy, embued with a hippie aesthetic, centered in New Age spirituality, who resides in a festive warehouse flat with, among others, a Sherpa and a quartet of Finnish dwarfs. The supporting cast includes David Duchovny as a conspiracy theorist and Jerry Stiller as Zoolander's conflicted manager.A remarkable aspect of the film is the huge amount of cameos, with over 30 celebrities making brief appearances. There's an interesting tension here in that celebrities were drawn into what is, ultimately, a brutal critic of the American celebrity culture and worship of images. That said, ZOOLANDER has become surprisingly dated in the few years since I last saw it, as many of those late 1990s/early millennium celebrities which it uses to build its case are now practically forgotten. I would have rated this rather higher only five or six years ago, but now the movie feels painfully awkward at times.If there is one aspect of the film that has stayed fresh, it's Owen Wilson's Hansel. This character is in some ways quite similar to that which Wilson played in THE ROYAL TENNENBAUMS, which appeared the same year, but is distinct enough to not just be a retread. Wilson has got a real gift for coming up with these eccentric freespirited types, often aloof from their surroundings because they are stoned or on hallucinogens. And sure, ZOOLANDER still has a lot of funny dialogue, and the audience can pleasantly sense how much fun Stiller, Wilson and Ferrell had while shooting it, but this isn't an especially great film and even its prominence in pop culture seems to be on the wane.",Zoolander

It is fun to search for all these tidbits, see all the cameos of people like Stephen Dorff or David Bowie and my absolute favorites were Zoolanders quote of ""The Godfather"" and the surprisingly intelligent side blow to ""2001 - A space odyssey""!Furthermore, as a child of the 80s I really enjoyed the homage which was shown to this decade in the movie, especially the music.

Me, I can sum it up in two words:  ""AUSTIN Posers.""  No, better yet, I'll boil it down to one word: ""endearing.""  That's right, endearing!  As lighthearted as it is lightheaded, this daffy spoof of conspiracy thrillers and the mad, mod world of male models and other hipsters has a surprising undercurrent of sweetness to it. Star/director/co-writer/co-producer Stiller plays dopey Derek Zoolander as a gentle, essentially kind-hearted naif under his hip veneer. The same is true of Owen Wilson, putting his twang and quirky humor to good use as Derek's rustic yet hippy-dippy rival-turned-ally Hansel. I suspect folks will like ZOOLANDER even better on DVD, since there are tons of hilarious extended scenes and deleted scenes as well as the original Zoolander TV sketches that Stiller & Co. did for VH1.

Five years later, the movie was adapted from this premise. In the meantime, in 1998, Bret Easton Ellis (author of American Psycho) finally completed and published 'Glamorama', which he'd been working on since the early '90's. In 2001, after the release of the movie, Ellis sued the producers for (poorly) ripping-off the plot of his novel, and settled for an undisclosed amount. Point is, you're better off reading the novel this movie lamely spoofed. Ben Stiller is a shallow airhead fashion model competing against rival model and professional dumb blonde Owen Wilson, and Will Ferrell is just there to ruin the movie, like everything he's in. Then it does like a whole bad Manchurian Candidate parody from what I remember.

Ben Stiller pulls an Orson Welles, or perhaps more accurately a Woody Allen as Derek Zoolander; aside from starring, he also directed, co-wrote, and co-produced the film.  Zoolander is the world's top male model, a vacuous pretty boy (Who isn't all that good looking since it is, after all, Ben Stiller) who finds his world crashing down around him.  His hated rival, Hansel (The hilarious Owen Wilson) is ""hot"" and wins Zoolander's award, Time magazine has just named him a ""model idiot"" and, to top it all off, an international cartel of fashion designers are plotting to use him as a disposable assassin in a scheme to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia. It's just that simple!Stiller gets plenty of mileage out of dumb model jokes, and his performance is the ultimate innocuous idiot good guy.  It's also nice to see the blonde female (Stiller's wife Christine Taylor) break stereotype and far outhink her male counterparts.  But the plot starts to fall apart at the end, with a bizarre alliance between Hansel and Zoolander that feels wrong, and a clunky and unexciting finale.  And for all his weirdness as evil designer Mugatu, Will Ferrell doesn't seem too funny, just weird.  The movie is so slight, on a bad day I might have said avoid it.  But in the right mood for the right price you can probably enjoy the movie on a certain level; goofy laughs and some good comedic acting.",Zoolander
146,hoxjennifer,"Outrageous, typical 2000's humour",6,9 October 2015,"Derek Zoolander is a dim-witted, but well meaning male model who is brainwashed into a plot to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia. Zoolander is typical early 2000's comedy: a plot that could have easily been written by an 8 year old with an over-active imagination, cheesy and predictable humour and interesting fashion statements. It's a ridiculous but fun movie. It's one of those movies that you can pull out on a rainy day for sh**s and giggles. But at the same time, it's not overly hilarious of its own accord. You laugh because the movie is silly, not because the jokes are ingeniously funny. It's completely random, it's full of plot holes and stereotypes, and overall - it's a stupid film, but it means well. I can see why it has such a cult following, but it didn't have me rolling on the floor laughing by any means.",Zoolander

But not in the sighing, rolling your eyes, praying to higher powers that the movie would end kind of way.  It was dumb in that overly cheesy ""Austin Powers"" sort of way.  In other words, you have to be pretty clever to write a character that utterly dim.Some of the comments were just so implausible, so ludicrous, that you couldn't help but laugh.  And I don't mean that in a negative way.  Can Derek Zoolander really be that dense?  In this movie, he can and he is.  Ben Stiller as the overly mugging model was hilarious, but Owen Wilson as his arch-nemesis Hansel really stole the show.  I'm not even that big of a Will Ferrell fan, but he's so over-the-top bizarre, you can't help but laugh.  To paraphrase a quote I've heard before, ""he can make you laugh the way a drunken clown can make you scared.""True, the plot's a little thin with Zoolander brainwashed into killing the ""Prime Rib of Propecia"" (watch the movie to understand), but the great majority of the gags and the one-liners are the fun in getting there.  And it also has a lot of great '80's songs bounding throughout the movie.It's funny.  One of the funnier films I've seen for this year, so that adds a point to it, but at the same time, it loses a point for removing the World Trade Center buildings from the movie.  A sign of the times, I'm afraid.

149,CinefanR,Very intelligent movie about stupidity,10,31 January 2012,"Not a favorite on the first viewing, when it premiered, this movie is - I have to admit it now - hysterical. Don't forget that it's a parody, it's quirky, completely ridiculous, insane & over the top and yes, people in it act stupidly. I'm not a fan of Ben Stiller, I haven't enjoyed any other movies of his, but this is spot on. I say justice has been done: it's been finally revealed that stupidity knows no gender when it comes to the fashion world, and it comes in epic proportions. By the way, the fashion world redeemed itself by participating in this movie. Watch for the countless cameos from famous people in the industry. The fact that they accepted to make a little fun of themselves shows that they do have a sense of humor, and that's quite refreshing. Oh, and Jon Voight deserves an Oscar for his deadpan performance as Derek's estranged father. He made me break down and cry tears of laughter over the terrible drama of the Zoolander family.

Ben Stiller isn't that great and I despise Will Ferrell more then the amount of hatred that is thrown at George W. Bush! I hate these dumb movies that go nowhere, aren't funny and have the stupidest concepts ever! Will Ferrell needs to find a cliff somewhere to jump off of so I don't have to deal with hearing another movie starring Will Ferrell is coming out next month.

And nobody in the world could play them quite like Stiller and Wilson. Stiller was also a writer and the director of Zoolander and knows how to put together a movie. While the movie often focuses on Derek and Hansel out modelling each other, I believe the real contest was off screen being played out on screen between the two. This being who could play the more sarcastic and larger than life model. Stiller may win this, but the sheer arrogance of Wilson's on screen demeanor tips the scale in his favour for me. When the two work together they are up there with the great duo's of comedy.This is far from Stiller's best work however, moving along a little too slowly at times. Having said this it is still well worth a look and should give you plenty of laughs providing you appreciate the Stiller Wilson combo.",Zoolander

It is awful from top to bottom and side to side.The only thing that I was looking forward to was maybe, maybe, Ben Stiller would take his shirt off or something, but we didn't even get that! In all seriousness, Ben Stiller is a good actor, and he had a concept which could conceivably have been hilarious, but it takes more than one single good actor to make a movie. There are many many funny movies, that I have laughed it, (most from the far past), so I am not without a sense of humor, you see.

The whole discussion between Zoolander and his friends about how meaningful it is to be a model is alone wonderful and hilarious.However, the decision to focus the plot on foiling an evil conspiracy, while providing some entertaining elements itself, overall adding nothing and instead distracted from the promising model-spoof theme. Almost all the humor in this film came from the portrayal of the modeling industry and they could have done so much more that was fresh and funny with that had they stuck with it. The conspiracy theme, on the other hand, took the film onto well-worn path that proved to be bland, tired, and predictable.",Zoolander
157,Funky A,Extremely funny comedy.,8,8 October 2001,"So, Zoolander is not the most intellectually dense movie you are likely to see this year. So what? It doesn't try to be that. It is instead an extremely funny movie starring Ben Stiller, one of the funniest comics right now. After the hilarious Meet the Parents, Stiller comes back for yet another hilarious comedy. This time, he plays Derek Zoolander, a dumb male model who is brainwashed to assassinate the Malaysian prime minister because he wants to put an end to child labor. Zoolander attacks with light(but extremely funny) humor the superficial and exploitative world of fashion. You will probably keep on wearing Nike shoes after seeing Zoolander but at least the movie as a target. But what is really important is Stiller and Owen Wilson, both absolutely hilarious as moronic male models who have to save the president. All the jokes either make you laugh out loud or at least smile. And there are plenty of them. Zoolander also has a lot of excellent cameos(including... DAVID BOWIE!!!... yeah!). As a parody of spy movies, Zoolander sure beats the dissapointing sequel to Austin Powers and may even top the first installement of Myers' James Bond spoof. I will have to watch them alongside one another and see. So, Zoolander won't change your life. So what, it will make you laugh a lot... Sometimes, that is all a movie should do.81%",Zoolander

160,EdYerkeRobins,1% Brain Activity. 97% Fun.,8,3 October 2001,"Some of the best comedies don't have what one would call intelligent humor (perfect example: The Three Stooges).  I love intelligent humor as much as anyone, but its a lot more fun to laugh out loud with friends over the stupidest little things than have a quaint chuckle alone at irony.  This is why the world needs films like ""Zoolander"".Most stupid comedies of late have been just that - stupid, weighed down by bad toilet and sex humor.  But here we have a comedy with a lead that takes his stupidity in stride down the walkway, and its (unlike most stupid comedies of late) really funny.  Ben Stiller (who also directed) is great as Derek Zoolander, a male model who wows the fashion world with his trademark brilliant look ""blue steel"", and gives critics a headache with his less-than-brilliant manners of speaking.  Stiller's intentional bad-acting gives Zoolander an even greater degree of stupidness, in all his blunders and absurdities; he really is THAT funny, especially in a ""did he just say what I think he said?"" sort of way because he really is THAT stupid. 
The film doesn't have the greatest longevity, since it removes most of the effect once you know what Zoolander will do or say next, and as the film winds down he actually gets a little smarter (fear not! a smarter Zoolander is still dumber than anyone you'll ever meet).  The most absurd moments, including Zoolander as a merman, a fashion awards ceremony that begins Zoolander's ""retirement"", and a walk-off competition between Zoolander and his biggest competition, extreme-sports-model/stoner Hansel (Owen Wilson) refereed by David Bowie, are by far the film's most (only?) memorable aspects, but as mentioned earlier, they're that absurd and that dumb that they stick around for a while.  There is also some subtle intelligent parody of the fashion industry and in-jokes that keep the film fresh for discussion with friends past the memorable moment's expiration dates.This obviously doesn't appeal to everyone (people who don't like cliches in their plots, for instance).  But to those that it does appeal to, its great fun, especially after all those disappointing summer blockbusters.",Zoolander

I did laugh. Just not as much as I hoped I would.And what the heck is Ben Stiller's dad doing in this movie? (That IS his dad, isn't it?) He is way too blue-collar for the role of a model's agent.

I laughed so hard through out the whole movie because it was ridiculously funny. I thought Ben Stiller acted so funny that it made the movie what it really is. Being a male model must have been really tough for Ben to act out but he did it great. His dad in this movie was really funny as well.

166,engelst,Not even worth the space on a DVD,3,22 April 2005,"This movie has one big problem: the main actor(s). Whereas the idea of making fun of the fashion industry isn't bad, and some parts are quite nice, the film suffers from too many actors who only *think* they are funny. Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller have worked together on a number of films that I can only remember because they irritated me enough to be noteworthy.Now, some people may think it really is funny to see Ben Stiller act like a fool. Personally, I started focusing my attention on any of the other actors (who were simply doing their job) whenever Ben Stiller got screen time (which is about 99% of the movie). I did this unintentionally for a while, until I noticed that I was hoping Zoolander would somehow disappear. That's when I used the remote.",Zoolander
167,MinorityReporter,Moderately entertaining but ultimately too stupid and repetitive!,4,26 April 2006,"When I try to think of just one line to start this review, the phrase: ""Not Stiller's best"" keeps turning up because this film is definitely not the best we've seen from him. Apparently the character of Zoolander was one that Stiller has given quite a lot of thought and has spent some time developing. I can't see how you could possibly spend time on a character as flat as Zoolander, however, because the character is only funny for about half an hour and then he just becomes annoying.Much of the comedy in the film is based on how stupid the male models are and while it is funny watching Stiller pose and making an ass of himself it grows thin quite quickly (I did find his three identical facial poses extremely funny). Stiller fills out the character and you can see that the character is important to him but the character was in my opinion probably better off as a sketch-character and not a character that would warrant an entire movie because he simply isn't interesting enough. Owen Wilson does a mediocre job at best and his character comes alive only in the scenes with Stiller because of their chemistry. Christine Taylor is in my opinion probably a below average actress and her performance in this film in particular is pretty stiff to say the least. She has no real presence. Milla Jovovich has a quite funny role in the film but unfortunately she is critically underused. Will Ferrel and Jerry Stiller are both decent and both of them never really become memorable. Jerry Stiller does his best but his character is just too limited.The trailer looked relatively funny but the actual film lacked spirit resulting in a very uneven comedy. There are a few funny scenes and only about one scene where I laughed hard and that was just not enough as I had expected more from it. The film also has another problem. Its too repetitive. Many of the jokes are recycled throughout the movie which would have been acceptable had the jokes been funny the first time but the problem as you have probably guessed is that they weren't.Zoolander is definitely a comedy you have to be in the right mood for because if you're expecting something witty and well scripted this probably isn't were you would want to place your money. You have to be in the mood for something that is stupid and at times lame but if you can settle with that you should give it a try. I, myself, did not enjoy the film particularly but I was probably also in the wrong mood for it and as always watching a film is a highly subjective matter.4/10",Zoolander

The movie, after all, is poking fun at entertainment, in particular, the fashion and model industry. This was a hilarious take on it, and Zoolander, our main character, is stupidly lovable. Ben Stiller proves once again his flexibility with his comedic acting. Just watch 'Meet the Parents'and this, you'll think it's 2 different actors. Showing you how much work Ben can do, he also helped write and produce the movie. Owen Wilson usually ends up in a movie with Ben, and he's hilarious too. And of course Will Ferrell is always a riot. Read the Plot Outline in the details, there's not much to it. But you don't watch movies like this for incredible story lines, do you?No, it's not an oscar winning comedy, most aren't. It's not an intelligent look at real-life, it's not the greatest storyline driven kind of movie, and it doesn't have top notch acting. But it's incredibly funny, especially the DVD. The DVD is filled with so many extra goodies, it's worth getting. The movie is filled with cameos like David Bowie, Paris Hilton, Billy Zane, AH!

The plot is interesting, and the dialogs are pretty clever.  The performances were pretty good as well, Ben Stiller was good as Zollander, I mean he makes you feel annoyed over him, which i think was the whole point, considering that Derek is the most stupid guy ever!  There were some pretty good performances from Christine Taylor, Jerry Stiller, Milla Jovovich and of course Owen Wilson.  But the best actor in this movie is definitely Will Ferrell, he cracks me up as Mugatu, and steals every single scene! Another great thing about this comedy is all the celebrities!  We get to see Christian Slater, Nataly Portman, David Bowie, Steve Kmetko, Fred Durst, etc....  It really gave it a touch.  The direction was fairly good.  The music was really good, it has lots and lots of good songs.I think that somebody who enjoys a good comedy, and doesn't question every single thing; the you should see this movie.

Of course I didn't expect much; in fact, I expected very little.The movie wasn't worse than I expected. But it definitely wasn't any better, either. This is a storyline--about a male model brainwashed to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia--completely out of touch with reality. It was hard to pick out any real-life emotion in this thing, and what little was there was obscured by the over-attempts at slapstick and comedy, patched together only passably by director Ben Stiller.What about the comedy? As I said, it tries too hard most of the time. But there are some good lines and some really laugh-out-loud moments. What I liked most of all, however, were the moments of extremely irreverent humor (though perhaps the joke involving Abe Lincoln and JFK was going too far). I just like that sort of thing, and if you like it, then you might find something in this movie.My dad loved this movie about 100%. But he's like that. He prefers movies that ARE out-of-touch with reality, that have lots of slapstick humor, and that don't really tap human emotions. He'll sit through a bunch of immaturity to experience complete escapism. If you fit that description, then you will like this movie, too.

There are many idiotic childish jokes, which makes you feel sometimes uncomfortable, or may cause you regrets for buying the ticket/renting the DVD. But since it is a parody, we have to accept that level. Ben Stiller is a great comedian, but in my opinion he is much more funny as a loser type, rather than the ""idiot"" type he plays in most of his movies.

Boy they look alike, a lot. I should have got his name and he could maybe be a good acting double. Or, then again I should have got the name of the 5'5"" Latino standing under the lamp post with the fur on top of it. Maybe some kind of funny joke, like Lucifer or something.Ben Stiller seems to play the same role as in Meet the Parents, Something About Mary, and Starsky and Hutch. Ben seems like the kind of Jew who would miss breaking the glass at his own wedding and trip in process knocking over the altar. Maybe this movie is about how careers collide and one profession brings out the best or worst in the people you work with. Brain washing is a serious business associated with propaganda like the use of this movie's medium FILM. I do not think world leaders like Japan's Kozumi, Britian's Tony Blair, or the United States of America's George Bush would approve of turning this medium for Zoolander and its objective into a reality. Thank God Ben Stiller is just an actor, but the screen writers God knows how they conceive the originality of this intellectual property.",Zoolander

Still, it is certainly amusing-- it's hard not to enjoy Ben Stiller (although I would have expected better from him) and Owen Wilson in their roles and it's easy to see that everyone involved is having fun.

I've wet my pants at the likes of Bottom, South Park and Alexi Sayle on many occasions. But this puerile single joke movie left me feeling brain dead. Mystery Men worked, because the super hero theme and great cast carried the fact that it wasn't particularly funny.

Zoolander is quite entertaining, because of the good performances. Stiller is good as Zoolander and Wilson is excellent as Hansel. Will Ferrell is good also, but doesn't have enough screen time.

187,the-jerk,model stupidity,9,10 June 2005,"I don't think I'll ever understand why this movie got such bad reviews. Too stupid for most critics? Whatever. Zoolander is a consistently hilarious movie.Ben Stiller should have more parts like this. It reminded me of some of the hilarious stuff he did on his show (no, I didn't watch it when it was first on, but I did buy the DVD when it came out). I was so glad to see him break the ""There's Something About Mary"" mold of nice, regular schlub who keeps having hilariously bad luck. Derek Zoolander was miles away from this stock character. He was a brazenly stupid man who got the good fortune of having ridiculously good looks, but he couldn't even turn left! One of the funniest things I've ever seen was the scene early on when he was beaten for best male model by Hansel (He's so hot right now), but just walks up to the stage anyway, completely clueless about his loss (despite the fact that the loudspeaker keeps booming ""Hansel"" over and over again as he's walking up. That electronic billboard he passed by with the words ""Confused Loser Zoolander Tries To Steal Award"" was classic. I thought that the movie actually had a lot of smartly written jokes.The supporting cast was great too, particularly Will Ferrell as Mugatu, who almost stole the movie (like he usually does). And Owen Wilson was great as Hansel, and so was Ben's dad Jerry Stiller. Christine Taylor was fine as the love interest, but she didn't really have much to do except react to the idiocy that was going on around her. I also liked the smaller parts, like Milla Jovovich as Katinka, and Jon Voigt as Derek's not-too-proud dad (his reaction to Derek's merman commercial, and Derek's subsequent reaction, was priceless), and David Duchovny, spoofing his character on ""X-Files"" and in the bargain doing the funniest spoof of the show I've ever seen. The cast was good all around, and even though I thought the movie fell apart a bit toward the end (I think it was the orgy at Hansel's place that started to lose me... I couldn't see Christine Taylor's character changing so abruptly), the laughs kept going to the end, and as a comedy, as well as a satire of the modeling business, I thought it performed admirably on the whole. Like I said, I think Ben Stiller should do more movies like this; for the first time in a while, I think we saw in this how much of a comedic genius he truly is.",Zoolander

Of course, I would never have bought a ticket knowingly to this movie, so I was prepared for anything, but I could take only 30 minutes of this trash. I gave it a chance and them after the fiftieth glare into the camera by Stiller and having my senses assaulted by the obnoxious 'mugambo' (or something like that) I walked out.

Like when Derek gets presented with the classic ""temptational buy-out prize"", in this case a model of to-be school for ""Children who cannot read so good"". I'm not going to spoil what Mr. Zoolander does out of that.. :DIf you liked ""Dumb and Dumber"", have stayed awake for a longer period than usual, or for some other reason you are ready to laugh your ass off at utter stupidity, you should definitively go for this.",Zoolander
190,pc_dean,Good Guys Wear Mousse,8,10 October 2001,"""Zoolander"" puts forth the notion that male models, and Fashion People in general, are shallow, self-obsessed, and sneeringly unaware of their own ridiculousness, and also that the bulk of international intrigue and diabolical scheming can be traced directly to the fashion industry.  While this makes it plausible to argue that it is in fact a documentary, it is actually proof that Ben Stiller is one of the best satirists working in movies today.  Okay, so it's a narrow field; but he is still a funny, funny guy, especially when you eliminate the Farrelly brothers, who would be lost without their casting director.Derek Zoolander (Stiller) is a famed male model, a man so shallow that he's actually convex.  Crushed at being eclipsed by a younger rival, he is recruited into a shadowy plot to become a brainwashed assassin for the international clothes cartel.  It's kind of like ""The Manchurian Candidate"" as imagined by Details magazine.Naturally, much is made of Derek's dimness, and that of male models in general.  Though much of it is funny, it does wear thin after a while. The movie is a lot funnier when instead of mocking fashion types as empty heads, it aims at the conventions of the industry itself, as in a scene where Derek and his fabulously-dressed buddies' magazine-spread romp at a gas station spins hilariously out of control, or a ""Bloodsport"" style confrontation between rival models ""at the old Members Only warehouse"".  The best gag in the movie concerns the concept behind a new fashion line, which is at once screamingly funny and scathingly true.  The numerous movie references are also well-brought off, and it is great fun to see familiar spy-movie conventions transplanted to the world of style, as in a meeting of faceless international villains of fashion (""I trust you want to live to see your spring line."")  The brainwashing takes place in a special ""day spa"" overseen by a Rosa Klebb-style dominatrix (Milla Jovovich) and her impeccably-clad goon squad who are always perfectly posed, even when tossing intruders out the steel doors.The cameos by notable real-life Beautiful People are a tad excessive, and lend ""Zoolander"" an in-jokey quality that it doesn't need, and dulls the edge on the sendup until the darts are more like Nerf arrows. Fortunately, most of the cameos are too fast to count, and they often do little more than walk by the camera (the movie often feels an annoying urge to name-drop and flash labels on the screen, lest you miss a card-carrying glitterati).  An exception is David Bowie's funny turn as a kind of haute-couture Mills Lane. But the central cast is the real show here.  Stiller's evocation of Zoolander's patented ""looks"" are hysterical. Owen Wilson's blank stare, misshapen nose, and ludicrous New Age claptrap make him a great foil as Hansel, Zoolander's scooter-slinging upstart rival.  David Duchovny does a great parody of his ""X-Files"" persona, just as he did in ""Evolution"" (I get a feeling this will be the arc of Duchovny's future career, at least until he gets a better agent).  Christine Taylor also makes a fine straight man as a reporter covering the Zoolander beat.  However, Will Ferrell does his level best to steal the show as Mugatu, a crazed designer, who plots political murder without batting an eye, but gets all hissy when there's too much foam in his latte.Oddly, ""Zoolander"" is helped somewhat by the ineptness of its trailers, which for some reason chose the more lackluster jokes to showcase, the ones that display Stiller's weakness as a writer and director: he is too often shy about trusting the audience to get a joke, and feels a need to over-explain or over-stage a gag until it ceases to be funny.  This instinct has hamstrung more than a few dynamite jokes in his career, and he needs to muzzle it.  Some of the funniest gags in ""Zoolander"" are the ones we see in brief, subtle passing, not the ones that have giant neon arrows reading ""Comic Moment"".""Zoolander"" may or may not be more amusing to those who are hip to the world of fashion.  I frankly wouldn't know.  But even those of us who couldn't pick Donna Karan out of a police lineup or wouldn't know a Manolo Blahnik if it kicked us square in the face, can appreciate the satiric skewering of those who do.  Even more, perhaps.There is, at the end, an unintentionally sad note to the comedy.  In the final credits, the movie gives special thanks to the Explosives Unit of the New York Fire Department.  God bless them every one.",Zoolander
191,Geordie-4,Very funny send-up of fashion industry,8,1 October 2001,"Contains Spoilers!! I don't know if this is really what the fashion world is like.....scary to think it's like this, but unfortunately, it's probably not too far from the truth.....anyway, this is a very funny parody of the clueless models and self-absorbed promoters.  Ben Stiller plays Derek Zoolander, who has been the pre-eminent male model in the US for many years.  He has recently been upstaged though by shaggy-maned Hansel (Owen Wilson), a hedonistic free spirit.  Zoolander wonders about the importance of his profession in the wake of a tragic gasoline accident and his declining popularity.  He begins to believe that he what he is doing is not very useful in the grand scheme of things.  Go figure.  So in this time of earnest self-reflection, he tries to re-discover his roots.  First, he tries to go home-to coal mining country in southern New Jersey, only to find his father (uncredited Jon Voight) ashamed of him.  He then considers starting a literacy program which he inadvertently stops by failing to realize that the model of his center is not the actual center.  He spurns modeling jobs, but finds he has very few other abilities.  So he is lured back into the world of modelling by an offer from the legendary designer Mugatu (Will Ferrell), who offers him the chance to headline his new line of clothes, Derelicte.  This is quite an opportunity for Derek as he has never worked for him.  The modeling line is the pretext through which Derek will be positioned to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia, a reformist who plans on eliminating child labor. The fashion designers cabal are scared about this as it will cut into their profits, so Derek is recruited to assassinate him at the end of the show introducing Derelicte.  He is selected as he is the dimmest and most malleable of all the models the designers can think of.  He is trained to respond in Pavlovian style to the stimulus of a song, and in the final confrontation, his attempt to assassinate the Prime Minister is jeopardized when another song is played.This really is a very funny film and is all meant in good fun.  Stiller and his co-writer Drake Sather have put together some incredibly funny moments. I found the first 20 minutes or so to be largely non-eventful, though punctured by some very humorous moments.  However from there, the film just gets funnier and funnier and I seemed not to stop laughing the last 45 minutes or hour.One really sees the inanity of the models and designers and there are many celebrity cameos in the film.  Everyone seems to enjoy poking fun at the fashion industry which they ironically support.  It is very well written. At some times, especially in the first half an hour, there were lulls in the laughter, where it seemed the air was sucked out of the theater.  However these lulls were usually replaced very quickly with uproarious howls of laughter.  I found this film to be a very funny send-up of the fashion industry and very entertaining.",Zoolander

It is just what many of us, who still seem to be a little meloncholy since Sept. 11, need right now. Stiller, as usual, is great and plays the amazingly stupid Derek Zoolander to perfection. The reason this movie works is because it is soooooooooooo stupid. It makes no attempt to be anything but ridiculous. Many people will hate this movie and I think it will get a cult following of mainly Gen Xer's like myself, but if you just except how inane it is suppose to be I think everyone will enjoy it. I remember when the first Austin Powers came out how stupid everyone thought it was and then it began to catch on around college campuses and high schools and now look at it. I believe Zoolander may very well have the same fate.",Zoolander
193,TheLastStop41,Disappointing...,7,11 February 2002,"Though I had a comment on this movie before, I have to say again, that it was a disappointment and I would recommend this if you don't want to look into the world of stupidity. The only good thing really about the movie was that it had extremely good potential, but it really blew it. It's one of those movies where your phsyced about it, but when you it's blah... A lot of talent was wasted in the movie. It had a pretty good cast, not great, and a good modern comedian, Ben Stiller. Ben Stiller has done much better in his career. He was great in Keeping the Faith and Meet the Parents. I didn't see Something About Mary, but it sounds hilarious from what I here on this site. I'm guessing it is, because it's done by the Farrely Brothers who created the comedy which is destined or already is a comedy classic Dumb & Dumber. But anyways with Zoolander, it's disappointing. If you want to see a good comedy brought to you in 2001 see Rat Race. That was one of the most pleasantly surprising movies I've seen in a while too. Another pleasant surprise from 2001 was Legally Blonde. Zoolander is a disappointing surprise. Zoolander's rating which has lowered from my last review is now 3/10.",Zoolander

I mean it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. It was disappointing. Ben Stiller has been in much better movies. Don't get me wrong it had it's good parts. Even with a 6.6 it's over rated. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't get the laugh out louds out of my body. This movie is the complete opposite of Rat Race. I didn't expect anything from Rat Race. It ended up being the funniest movie I've ever seen. In this movie the plot is something everyone has seen before, someone has been brained washed to kill a prime minister. Sound fimiliar??????????? I think we've seen something exactly like it, or have seen something close to it. We've probably seen it in a James Bond film, or The Jackal, etc. Oh yeah and we'll probably see it in an upcoming Mission Impossible film. But those movies weren't comedies. This movie attempts to be a competition with Austin Powers and I'll tell you, this is no Austin Powers. But I have to admit that I didn't care much for the first Austin Powers. I loved the sequel. My point is that, if they make a sequel to this, there is a chance it will be better. But Zoolander is one of those movies that you'll hate, not sure about it, or love it 'til the day you die. So go see it anyway if you want too. Besides it is only my opinion. You may love it. Rating: 5/10",Zoolander
195,stevenleadbetter,No time to think? Go see Derek,4,4 November 2001,"Ben Stiller stars in a movie that is as empty and devoid of content as the industry it portrays. Admittedly, this picture does contain a handful of genuinely funny moments but they are too few and far between to cause much of a rumpus. Brought out amid the foray of media of the September 11th atrocities, it has generally been well received by the critics with its efforts to make the people of New York smile again. That in itself is a very good point, but it still does not save what, when released under normal circumstances, is a very lacklustre event. Very forgettable if it wasn't for the very brave Producers to release this at a time when public reaction could easily have gone the wrong way, but didn't.(4/10)",Zoolander

The characters lack depth and are unrealistically stupid and the plot is lame but so what??? That's exactly what the movie is supposed to be, just a simple stupid comedy. While not the cleverest parody it makes fun of the Fashion industry in a nice way, with models being very self-centered and having the IQ of a lipstick, designers that are extremely eccentric, (Will Ferrell kicks ass as Mugatu), and generally things in this movie are stupid but funny. The movie is full of some quite funny quotes and slapstick humor, dumb characters and crazy situations if you like these stuff you're gonna love Zoolander.You'll hate Zoolander if: You expect an above average parody, something with more depth or if you hate stupid comedies. Don't expect an extremely clever movie Zoolander is a one of them stupidly wacky ones, full of cheap laughs and very crazy situations. The characters are flat as a wall, logic is non-existent and stupidity defines the word limitless. Example: The 2 main protagonists search for clues and find a computer they don't know how to use it so they start jumping around and hitting the computer like Chimps and when someone tells them that the files are inside the computer one of them destroys it and upon seeing the computer broke into pieces he says: ""Hey, where are the files?"". Also too much useless and irritating use of famous people portraying themselves I don't know about you but I hate that especially when it isn't even funny. Finally the movie is quite fun the first time you see it but gets 10 times more boring the second time.FINAL VERDICT: Enjoyably Stupid (5.7/10)[+] Lots of funny and stupid scenes and quotes. Nice parody of the fashion industry.[-] Not a ""clever"" comedy. Could be better as a parody. Only for renting.Also Check: Austin Powers (1997) - Dumb And Dumber (1994) – Meet The Parents (2000) - Scary Movie (2000)P.S.: My purpose in all my IMDb Reviews is not to say ""I like\don't like this movie"" but to help you decide whether YOU will like it or not since everything is all about taste and expectations IMO...",Zoolander

I mean this movie is so incredibly stupid it just makes it hilarious. I think that what really makes it funny is the fact that everyone in this movie remained serious. Dry Humor is just the best.

The film is supposed to be stupid, it's supposed to have serious plot holes, and it's supposed to be just all in all a stupid movie. In terms of its stupidity, Ben Stiller is hilarious. Zoolander's deadpan, humorless take on the importance of male modeling is uproarious. Will Ferrell's crass, troll doll-looking Mugatu is ridiculous to be a fashion icon, but is. Milla Jovovich is very funny as the aggressive and out-of-control henchwoman.

202,charliegeeza,I can't believe it's not rated higher,10,7 November 2013,"This is a masterful parody on the shallow culture that has become so ingrained in modern society. While it is about male models, it could be about anything regularly adorning the cover of popular media.Derek Zoolander, our protagonist and the world's leading male model, bumbles his way through life trading purely on his limited male modelling skills. When he is knocked off his perch by Hansel - so hot right now - Zoolander is stranded in a world that he doesn't understand and is easily manipulated.The movie is full of comedy genius and takes celebrity culture through the proverbial shredder. Will Ferrell's character, Mugatu is a particular highlight. I am stunned that it (at time of writing) only achieves a 6.4 on IMDb. It is consistently funnier and far more clever than the likes of Old School (7.1) or Tropic Thunder (7.0). That Night at the Museum gets a similar rating (6.3) is an absolute travesty.Zoolander is a Stiller classic, is ageing well, and will get watched again and again years into the future when most IMDb ""6"" rated movies will be long forgotten. I suspect that the ""6"" is a typo - 8.4 is more realistic.",Zoolander
203,deputydoofus,"Funny while watching it, even funnier while thinking about it",8,28 September 2001,"ZOOLANDER is one strange film.  Its sort of like a full on assault on the brain, spitting out so many weird ideas and creative jokes all at once that its impossible to catch them all.  The plot is so bizarre and haphazardly constructed that talking about the story almost seems irrelevant.  It is probably useful information to say that the plot has to do with assassinating the prime minister of Malaysia and involves a somewhat disturbingly funny funeral scene that overlooks the city of New York. These events would be disturbing enough if we hadn't all witnessed the WTC attacks a few weeks ago, but now they seem just so disturbing that the scenes seem appropriate.  This perhaps made the film much darker than it needed to be when released, but perhaps the way in which these events are presented, as being rather dark and still humorous, that this film seems awkwardly precient in a way.Still, as I said, the plot is irrelevant.  What makes ZOOLANDER important is that it is probably the funniest film of the year, at least for me.  Sure, its not as wholesome as BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY, and it perhaps didn't have the unexpected charm of RAT RACE, and it wasn't as much fun as RUSH HOUR 2, and it wasn't as good of a film experience as SHREK.  However, it is perhaps the most consistently funny film I have seen, and the biggest laughs are probably the most creative of the year.  Overall, the film is so packed with cleverly conceived and executed ideas that just thinking about each individual scene provides entertainment in itself.  My favorite scenes include what happens when Zoolander and his friends go out for Orange frappucinos, the orgy scene, Zoolander's film prepared for his nomination VH1 fashion awards, and the quite unexpected yet wholly appropriate 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY reference.  I'm laughing very, very hard just thinking about these scenes.  I wasn't quite certain how much I liked the film right after seeing it, but now I'm certain that it has provided quite enough entertaining memories to sift though.If you let your mind think about it too much, it is perhaps easy to find ZOOLANDER offensive, or find the plot ludicrous, or realize nothing makes sense, or realize that you can't explain why your laughing.  But I would advise you just let your inhibitions go.  The good laughs here are some of the most refreshingly original laughs in years.  The only thing keeping this film from achieving cult comedy status from the likes of films such as THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, WAYNE'S WORLD, or AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY is that it isn't quite well thought out enough to truly be as effective as a whole.  It all just sort of fizzles out at the end, when everyone realizes that there's no way you could possibly lead up to with that incomprehensible of a plot.If the trailer of Zoolander seemed incomprehensibly stupid to you as well as unfunny, don't go and see it.  However, if you laughed at Zoolander's trailer and are dying to see it, go on, as it is at least as funny as the film's trailer.  There's a lot of weird stuff here, but it all flashes by so quickly that it will all wash out of your brain very quickly.

205,ericventura,Satirically Stupid,8,15 June 2017,"It's stupid. So incredibly stupidly ridiculous. If there was a contest for stupidest stupidity, Derek Zoolander wouldn't be able to figure out how to accept the award. But it's also incredibly funny. And incredibly inappropriate. And it came out at the wrong time. Zoolander is a stupidly funny and inappropriate movie.The plot of the movie is abysmal and the concept is idiotic. The characters are cliché and static. The writing is awkward and Sandler-esque. Every other element of the film is completely unmemorable and done with average ability. Everything combines to create an extremely unrealistic film of the classic Hollywood comedy genre. So is Zoolander a good or bad movie? The film is actually an incredibly intelligent (but stupid) piece that both criticizes and satirizes multiple aspects of society at once, including the genre niche that this movie resides in. The screenplay is written so that Derek, played by Ben Stiller, can both be laughed at and sympathized with. The valleys and mountains that Derek Zoolander crosses are stupid, yet the viewer becomes attached to him. Standard filming forces the viewer to attach themselves to the main character's hopes and dreams. Thus, the parody and satire in the characters and events vigorously come across the screen.Zoolander is another Hairspray (1988) or Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964), a wonderful satire on the events and feelings of the time. Yet Zoolander is even funnier.",Zoolander
206,danthemovieman,Ben Stiller is laugh out loud hilarious,10,6 December 2002,"Ben Stiller is laugh out loud hilarious in ""Zoolander"". Its a story about a male model, when he fails to win the ""Male Model of the Year"" award for the forth straight time, he ventures out to find out who he is. The winner of the award, Hansel (Owen Wilson), starts to become extremely famous, while Derek Zoolander, is becoming a nothing. When Magatu (Will Ferrell), discovers how stupid Derek is, he brainwashes him to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia. There are many parts that make you laugh so hard your about to cry. One for example, when Derek's friends are fighting Derek yells ""Stop it!"" "" Don't you think there is more to life than being really, really, really ridicuolusly good looking. I mean, maybe we should do something more meaningful with our lives, like helping people"" His friend replies ""Uh, Derek, what people?"" Derek then throws up his hands in disguist saying, ""I don't know, people who need help!"" This is one of the many laugh out loud lines in this movie. Another one, when his friends die in a freak gasoline fight accident, Derek gives a speech at their funeral, his starting line is ""Brint, Meekus, and Prince were like brothers to me. And when I say brother, I don't mean like an actual brother, but I mean it in the way black people use it, it's just more meaningful I think"" The funniest scene in this movie is the ""Walkoff"" scene, when Hansel and Derek go head to head in a walkoff.
There are many star cameos in this movie, such as Wionna Ryder, David Duchovney, Natalie Portman, and Cuba Gooding Jr. The whole Stiller family is in this movie as well. Ben Stiller's dad, Jerry Stiller, plays his good friend and proud owner of ""Ball's Models"", Morrie Ballsteen. Also, you can spot Ben Stiller's mother as the woman throwing an egg at Magatu in the third scene.This movie is a must see. Each scene has atleast five laugh out loud laughs and the fun never stops. If you read Roger Ebert's review on this movie, don't trust him, he is definetely 100% wrong. I saw ""Mr. Deeds"" a week ago. I liked it, but Ben Stiller is ten times as funny as Adam Sandler could ever be. This movie is non-stop fun, you must see it. Now I usually don't give many movies, especially comedies, four stars but ""Zoolander"" deserves it. A blast!**** out of ****",Zoolander

So what does this mean?  It means that if you think EXTREME STUPIDITY is funny then go see it, otherwise stay away.  Also, the actor didn't look like a male model which made the movie even less believable (like if that is possible! LOL). Anyways, to me the movie wasn't funny at all and I don't understand how someone could find it funny.  But just like I said, my friend liked it so I guess it depends on the person.  I remember that I didn't find the trailer funny, so that could be a hint.  If you enjoyed the trailer go see it, if you didn't find the trailer interesting then stay away.

I was pleasantly surprised on how funny and mindless it is. Ben Stiller is a great comedic actor, and should keep up the good work. Here he scores some laughs as dim-witted male model Derek Zoolander, who loses his 4th straight Male Model of the Year award to up-and-coming model Hansel (Owen Wilson, Stiller's co-star in ""Starsky and Hutch""). Derek retires from the modeling business, but is brought back when haute couture king Mugatu (Will Ferrell), offers Derek a job modeling his new Derelicte line of clothes, and then brainwashes Derek into killing the prime minister of Malaysia. Derek doesn't see any harm, but Time Magazine reporter Matilda Jefferies (Christine Taylor) sees some suspicion and tries to pull Derek out of it before it's too late. You'll have to see the movie to find out if there's a happy ending! This movie is mindless fun, and I have been trying to track down a copy for myself, but I cannot find it anywhere. So I think I am going to go rent it tonight so I can have a little evening of mindless fun. **** out of *****.",Zoolander

216,LeslieLLKing,"Zoolander - Colorful, Creative, Original and Thoughtful.",10,8 September 2005,"By the exaggerated tagline, ""3% body fat, and 1% brain activity,"" I just knew that Zoolander was going to be smart and funny. And, it was. If you can rise above the literal visual interpretation to the gasoline pump fight, you'll find it too, has an underlying educational, or at least, helpful message. The characterizations of good guy versus bad guy are whimsical, creative, colorful, and funny. Derek Zoolander, (Ben Stiller) is Ben's wonderfully exaggerated version of the male model, one who is offering his best attempt to be ""Balls Models"" 4th year in a row, model of the year. Sadly, he loses to Hansel, (Owen Wilson) a sweet blue, green, star eyed, soft lined, model. At the loss, quirky, carefree and complex, Derek questions his reflection in a puddle of water, ""Who Am I?"" In search of an answer to his question, he returns home to the coal mines of New Jersey, where his generally reluctant father, Larry Zoolander ( John Voight) and what looks to be his two evidently, (one Judah Friedlander) inarticulate brothers, reside. But, it is Derek's agent, Maury Ballstein (Jerry Stiller) who encourages him to return to New York, so that Derek can take on the assignment, as model for Mugato's (Will Ferrell) ""Derelicte,"" campaign. Maury is passionate and sincerely wants for his models to succeed, at making a living, in modeling. Mugato is obsessed with having Derek assassinate Malaysia's prime minister, Hassan (Woodrow W. Asai), one with a fondness for fashion and vogue, and a desire to increase pay standards, in the production industry. Derek takes the job, but little does he know that Mugato's black leathered assistant, Katinka, (Milla Jovovich) will be leading him into a day spa, that is more like a torture chamber, one designed to brainwash him into assassinating Malaysia's leader. Matilada Jeffries, (Christine Taylor) a reporter for Time, assigned to reporting on fashion events, will soon find herself in the midst of discovering a personal life, originating from her professional one. And fortunately, Hansel, is more than a competitor to Derek, but a friend, who saves both Derek and the leader of Malaysia, from an untimely death.The entire script is so creatively and colorfully articulated and presented, that one cannot help but have just so much fun, or alternatively be filled with suspense, as to whether or not Mugato will have his way with Derek. David Duchovny's scene, (mystery man on the cell phone), as scruffy bearded, eye glassed, and glass encased hand, J.P. Prewitt, at the cemetery, is really well done. In an interestingly woven monologue, he begins by explaining buried models' pre-mature deaths, scenes that include butt cheeks and abs sculpted on gravestones. It's very Tim ""Robbinseque"" in mood and tone and very well performed.Zoolander was much more rich in plot, characterization, and development than I had expected, after hearing, that ""it didn't get great reviews."" And the story still results in a very happy ending. Good wins over evil, and good guy hero gets girl. So who is Derek Zoolander? Answer: A really sweet guy, who is cute, funny, sensitive, articulate (although can't say eulogy, and instead says ulogee, but just adds more to his cute and funny attributes), and one who, we gather, has a terrific girlfriend, and cool best friend, with whom he pursues one of his true life long passions, to open up a school for kids, ""to read really good.""

Unlike many silly comedies where the previews show you the only humorous parts of the film, this movie was funny the whole way through. The casting is just perfect. Ben Stiller is hilariously suited to the role, the way he speaks and moves and his facial expressions are just dynamite. Every time I see his face in the film I laugh. Owen Wilson is likewise perfect in his part, as are the rest of the cast. I like this movie because it is different, with an original plot and actors that support the plot rather than taking away from it. None of the characters are too large, the acting is just spot on for each person. I highly recommend this film for a good chuckle. It is so silly but so clever at the same time.

The runway showdown is priceless and Will Ferrell once again quietly steals the show with his over the top character Mugatu.

Derek Zoolander is a one-joke character.  And so its no surprise that the full length movie built around him falls flatter than a bad perm.I was amazed by how few laughs this movie had.  And the few jokes that were in `Zoolander,' have already been revealed in the trailer! Now `Zoolander' does have its moments, the celebrity cameos for example, are funny.

I liked all the great little cameo appearances by some recognizable faces, and many of the fashion gags were scathingly satirical.  Not really laugh-out-loud funny, but humorous in goofy way.  Stiller's stupid-male-model act can be a little grating after awhile, but the performances by Ben's father Jerry Stiller and comedian Will Ferrell really stood out over everything.  I must say, the more I see Will Ferrell, the more I fall in love with his glib, comedic style.  He is just a naturally funny guy.  This can be seen all the more if you watch the DVD version which has all the extended/deleted scenes and outtakes.

234,mgreene-2,"Falls short of a classic, still a worthwhile watch",6,30 May 2002,"Once the viewer can get over Ben Stiller's mildly irritating on-screen persona as Derek Zoolander, the film actually becomes a somewhat amusing show. The concept of Zoolander similarly mirrors the Farley Brothers (Kingpin, Shallow Hal) standard comedic formula where a spoofy, goofy, dim-witted martyr ends up becoming a hero. And in the end, our hero ends up saving the day while doing the right thing, and eventually is rewarded with love. However, the similarities between the films stop there. Zoolander's obvious strengths are its Austin Powers-like costume and set design where a lot of flamboyant colors, outfits, and hairdos help keep the movie visually interesting, while giving it an almost post modern feel. Unfortunately, this aspect of the film is somewhat exacerbated by the gimmicky post-production and editing techniques employed. As expected, the acting is reliable and sound, especially Owen Wilson, who has a natural on-screen presence and is humorous, yet believable in just about every movie he co-stars in.The script has both an upside and several drawbacks.  The male model concept of the film is quite original, yet as previously mentioned the movie is formulaic. Also, many of the one-liners and other jokes miss, so although the movie is entertaining it is not incredibly funny. Furthermore, Zoolander fails to succeed in delivering one of its primary social commentaries - the fact that there is more to life than just looks and image. While it does make the film more entertaining, every back-up in the movie is beautiful and the film is highly stylized thus adding to the hypocrisy of its message. (In its defense, the parallel message of sweat shop labor exploitation in 3rd world countries definitely hits the mark.) The best thing about Zoolander is the last 30 minutes where the majority of the comic relief appears. It comes primarily from the supporting cast, especially Wilson and Jerry Stiller and it really does make the movie a worthwhile viewing, at least for a weekday night. Overall, Zoolander is an attention-grabbing and unique film that has its moments, but its too frequent clichés and unfunny scenes make it a no-better than a slightly above average comedy. 6/10",Zoolander

In fact it comes in just above average because when it is funny, it is laugh out loud funny. Not surprisingly, when you have Ben Stiller turning in another great performance! He is a bit of a master at this type of role though and some may say that it gets tiring seeing the same kind of humour being churned out again and again. People were turning against Jim Carrey and Robin WIlliams for the same comedy showcases again and again before they defied expectations and went against the grain. It shows that they can do more than just comedy and gain a betetr critical reception for it!! Anyway back to the subject - Zoolander is a little reminiscent of the Austin POwers movies with its over the top set pieces and pantomimic villains however it works when the storyline is just as ridiculous!Stiller plays Derek Zoolander, a male model who's star is falling whilst OWen Wilson (Stiller's regular sidekick) rises to international fame as Hansel, the stealer of Zoolander's Male MOdel OF The Year crown. They are both portrayed as stupid himbos who have to rely on the brains of a female Time Magazine reporter when Zoolander is brainwashed to kill the Malaysian prime minister by a villainous fashion designer (Will Ferrell, deliciously camp). Part of the joy of this film is watching out for the cameo appearances..Jon Voight, Winona Ryder and Builly Zane have larger roles whilst you can also see Victoria BEckham, Paris HIlton on the down side!! The scene when Zoolanders mermaid advert is screened in a miners village with his dad and brothers [present is priceless and probably my favourite part of the film but also look out for the calendar and the MAgnum...You will be trying hard not to laugh..Give it a go.

By the way she is not Maureen McCormick, she is actually Ben Stiller's wife, his mom had a small role in the movie too, but the dad had a larger one. I liked the music they had in there too, especially the Relax song. Overall I think everyone should enjoy this movie, it's funny for just about every age.

240,niel,This might have made the 100 worst movies except for the wonderful cast,5,12 March 2002,I can understand Ben Stiller using his father in this. But if he didn't think this movie unworthy for him he should have considered his father's career. Ben Stiller is a fine actor but this makes me wonder about his directorial talent. He took a fine cast and made a movie without much of a script. There are very few yuks in this. How he can squander his father's great comedic talent is a mystery. Even more mysterious is his skill at wasting the talents of Milla Jovovich. One can go the entire movie and not realize that she's even there. What a waste. If they only had a script and a few jokes. I expect to see something of Owen Wilson in the not too distant future.,Zoolander

242,livealot,Funny but lacking...,6,1 June 2003,"A friend of mine called this the funniest movie that he has ever seen. I remained doubtful and after seeing it I concluded that my friend either hasn't seen many movies or has a rather odd taste.It was quite funny in bits but I found myself sitting for long periods of time with my arms crossed not laughing. I found some of the characters annoying - especially Mugatu and Katinka. Katinka more than anything.Ben Stiller however was at his best with Zoolander, he's highly talented at comedic acting, writing and directing. I look forward to whatever he can come up with next.Overall, the film lacked a general cohesiveness and while having some incredibly funny one-liners and being a good spoof of the fashion industry just didn't hit the right chord with me. 5/10",Zoolander
243,imdb-3362,A pleasure to watch,8,7 October 2004,"I really wonder what that 'six' rating is all about ...This is a movie I have watched several times, and every time the overall silliness gets to me. The wonderfully goofy mock-intellectual conversations among the models, the recurring misunderstandings caused by differences in a model's skewed grasp on things and the actual reality surrounding them, microscopic cell phones .. it's just funny as hell. Owen Wilson, whose life consists of a series of gadgets, fads, drugs and leisure time only, Ben Stiller taking a trophy he did not actually win (Michael Jackson should have been hosting that ceremony ..). It's all good enough for me.What I appreciate even more about this movie is the visual perfection. So much work has been invested into creating interesting sets and locations, great lighting and camera work, with the weird 'indoctrination sequence' in the day spa taking the cake. The great number of cameos adds to the mix - ""Put a cork in it, Zane!"".Anyway, always enjoyable and a pleasure to watch. You can delve for deeper layers, like Ben tries to do for a day with the equally spike-haired relatives (""I'm not a professional television or movie actor!"" - Jon Voight), but that's probably not what this movie was made for.For entertainment, comedy and production values, I will happily concede an 8/10.",Zoolander

And believe it or not, it's all rather good-natured humor. I'd say it's the best Ben Stiller movie I've seen so far, just edging out ""Meet the Parents"" and not a gross-out flick like ""Something About Mary."" OK, it's totally silly and frivolous, but it's silliness and frivolity at it's best. The best scenes are the brainwashing segment and the ""walkoff"" between Zoolander and Hansel with David Bowie as referee. And it's great to see Ben and his dad working together.",Zoolander

Previously liking the principal cast of this film, (including Owen Wilson and Will Ferrel), I was more than a little dissapointed after seeing what a clumsy mess Zoolander turned into. The concept wasn't great to begin with, but such terrible execution on the tried and true Dumb and Dumber formula turned this film into an example of what not to do in a comedy. There are a few moments that may cause tiny giggles, but these moments are also mind numbingly dumb. Proceed with caution... this movie sucks.",Zoolander
246,lowth2000,5 out of 10,5,12 December 2001,"I came out of the film declaring it to be worth no more than four out of 10. I can't fully explain why I have given it such a poor mark even after upping it to a 5.  It was not that bad, it contained funny moments, it contained some good ideas, and it had good actors in.  However, it was a big disappointment.It just wasn't funny enough.  Zoolander was over acted and poorly portrayed by Stiller.  The character smacked not of idiocy but of insincerity.  He was annoying, predictable and ill thought out.  It would have been so much better if Stiller had not affected that dumb accent.  The accent didn't really work for me and it would have been better to show Zoolander's stupidity entirely through his dialogue and actions.  It was stupid and ridiculous.  It did contain good ideas with a great deal of potential humour but... it just didn't work.  To me it seemed ill thought out, like the first draft of a film, nor really ready for publication.  It reminds me strongly of another Stiller vehicle, Mystery Men.  Bags of potential but ultimately disappointing.  It's like the whole thing was just the product of a bunch of mates having a laugh together.  It needed a lot more work put into it at the writing stage, and basically a lot more planning prior to production.The characters were weak.  The models were write offs as main characters almost immediately - they would have been excellent props and quite useful as sub characters.  The humour was generally one level humour and without any shade of subtlety.  There were far too few laughs and at the audience could be seen cringing on more than one occasion during the film.  That said, it was well produced and there were funny moments, such as David Bowie's cameo.  Still the funny moments were not developed enough and surely, with further work in pre production flaws such as these could have been reduced. This was not an unwatchable film.  It was entertaining but sadly not awfully funny, and surely, that is what a comedy is supposed to be?",Zoolander
247,biff39093,Just what we need,8,29 September 2001,"I went into Zoolander just wanting to laugh uncontrolably.  Guess what, that is exactly what I got.  The jokes on pop culture are right up my alley.  The one thing I can not stand about society today, is the use of cell phones, and how small they have become.  Ben thought of a nice joke, and the movie featured a cell phone the size of a half dollar.  That is one of the prize pieces of the film.  If you are somewhat aware of pop culture, and very cynical then you will find this picture hilarious.  While in the theater no one was really laughing that much.  People seemed to only laugh at the parts they had seen on television numerous times before.  I think that people did not really understand the jokes, and therefore could not laugh.  They assumed that it was a brainless comedy.  This was not the case.  The characters appear thoughtless, but the dialogue is rather witty.  If you want to escape from things that have been going on, especially in Manhatten, then go see Zoolander.  You will not regret you went, just make sure you do not turn your brain completely off, you will need part of it to understand some of the jokes.  Well, what are you waiting for, go see this movie NOW.",Zoolander

The real reason I loved this movie was for Will Farrel's hilarious performance as the villain.  I only remember laughing this hard seeing this as I did on ""My Cousin Vinny"".

251,Blou,Ha Ha Hilarious!,9,28 December 2001,"Okay, so it may not be winning too many professional nods from industry big-wigs (Oscars, Golden Globes, Cannes), but that is not ""Zoolanders"" objective. These sorts of comedy movie characters can usually be traced back to a comedy sketch routine done on a comedy show, so making a movie-lengthed sketch can't prove fatal. The plotline basically entails a plot to brainwash Derek to kill the president of Malaysia (something to do with child labor laws) but the film is so funny, who need a plot! Ben Stiller plays top male model Derek Zoolander, the most desired and popular male model in the world. With expertise and an ironic charm, Ben Stiller sucks in the cheeks and bungs on the accent to get that hilarious Derek Zoolander attitude that only he can pull off! ""Zoolander"" is an acidic look at the fashion world, employing many model stereotypes into the movie as humour (such as eating habits and tantrums)......and believe me, it does get the laughs! Without being overly cheesy and spoofish, ""Zoolander"" is able to cleverly poke fun at the little seen world of male modelling. Owen Wilson is fabulous as Derek's rival, Hansel, and Stillers real life wife Christine Taylor plays a reporter whose story on Derek gains some attention.
Don't expect a cinematic masterpiece here. What you'll get is a hilarious, funky and cameo filled to the brim flick which is a fun option when you can't be stuffed sitting through films like ""Traffic"".***/*****",Zoolander

Milla Jovovichs Betty Page hair, big red lips, dominatrix gear with a Natasha ( of Boris and Natasha stupid squirrel fame) is great. Jovovich is hilarious and plays her part to the hilt.

255,zelig77,"not for all tastes, but certainly for mine!",8,11 April 2002,"let me first say that i love almost everything ben stiller has ever done, so i'm a little biased. i don't think the movie warrants extensive analysis, but i watched it 3 times in the first week of it's release, and with many different people, with different tastes, and levels of humor/intelligence. i noticed something while watching this with my different groups of friends. now i love all my bestest pals, but not everyone of them is exactly what i'd call a supergenius. in fact some of my friends range from flakey, to downright morons! anyway, what i noticed is this: my friends which i would classify as more on the ""intelligent"" side were laughing their guts out through the duration of the film, while my ""dimmer"" friends were stone cold. hmmmmm...it was almost as though they didn't get the jokes! weird, huh? the jokes that they thought were ""stupid"" or ""gay"", as they would put it, were often the ones that had me, and some others in tears! i'm not sure exactly how i want to put it, but it's like many of the jokes were some new form of ""smart-stupid"". i don't know, they were just jokes of the broadest kind, the kind that almost stop the movie to say ""do you get who i'm making fun of right now""? you could make the criticism that the jokes were often forced, but i for one felt relieved that i wasn't the only person who feels surrounded by idiots now and then. that may sound snobbish, but i don't care. i'm sick of peolpe who are willing to accept anything the entertainment industry throws at them. to quote ben stillers pal, jeanenne garafolo, ""there's a part of me that's envious of people who don't care what's put in there eye hole, ear hole, mouth hole, nose hole, etc. acid washed jeans? sure. lion king? yes. lion king soundtrack? i'll take one."" well, i best not get too riled up, i'll go on like this for far too long. (i may have already) basically what i'm saying is , i think ben stiller has succeeded in making a damn funny film, that is , i think, a little more subversive than given credit for. he's not just picking at fashion, i think he's testing the audience a little too. i think the movie is more personal for him than most people would guess. i loved it.p.s--the dvd has a hilarious narration by ben stiller for each section of the menu! if anyone cares.p.s.s---i hated supertroopers by comparison, if it helps put this rant into perspective.",Zoolander

257,madmax007,Never Take This Film Seriously,6,8 June 2008,Ben Stiller is known for making mediocre comedies that try to attain big Box-Office numbers this is the best one out of all of them. In this film vehicle Stiller adds another mentally deluded character to his resume of already mentally deluded characters namely seen in Heavyweights and Dodgeball. Lucky for Ben Stiller he's able to have his own screen vehicles which is rare in Hollywood he was also able to choose the cast he wanted. This is all because at a young age his parents helped him gain ties to big name producers in Hollywood and New York and since has been able to direct his own screen vehicles and get his way in casting. This film itself is solely based on two television specials lampooning the fashion industry shown at the 1996 and 1997 MTV Fashion Awards. Its about a shallow vain below average model. The film starts of with the once king of all models falling into obscurity and becoming the laughing stock of the whole fashion industry overthrown by the Acid Tripping free-spirited Hansel. Zoolander completely alienated by the fact that after so long he's no longer the industries top model and because of this rude awakening he goes to find himself which is hard to do considering that hes a shallow narcissist. He first does this by trying to bond with his remaining family who disown him. Being both emotionally and mentally confused easily falls into a Brain Washing conspiracy to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia who has gotten rid of sweatshops to get rid of child labor which would eventually bankrupt the fashion outlets. This is schemed by Mugatu who tricks Zoolander into believing that he's reviving his career assisted by his also vain assistant Katinka.One could dub this film National Lampoon Goes To The Fashion Show but that title is not genuinely as could as Zoolander the last name attributing to Stiller's vainness and soft spoken approach of moral understanding. This film is never to be token seriously and since being a flop in theaters has become a cult film. However I'm not to attracted to cult films.,Zoolander
258,Dotacion,What's that smell?,1,13 April 2004,"Some moveez emit a foul odor and leave a strange residue behind.Zoolander for instance.Granted, like smelling your own vapours, it's not without it's earthy delights. De Sade and other great philosophers were wise enough to never become too detached to enjoy the groveling and filthy part of life, for it is not without it's humbling charms.It would be a great day for this country if our duly elected officials admit they occasionally like to be tied up and humiliated by dominatrix. East out of the bowl, little doggy. Arf!I was reminded of a movie from the 70's - Faye Dunaway was in it¹ and it had an awfully slow pace. It was (to the best of my recollection) about the vacuous life of a model... and like many movies that portray characters in some sort of banal state, end up becoming banal itself... in that most awful sort of indulgent way (e.g. Lost in Translation). Poor baby, you're pretty, that's all that matters. kissZoolander, and this unnamed Dunaway pic, were nothing alike, aside from the subject matter. Dunaway's was a dramatic treatment of a woman losing her grip on reality... Zoolander, well, lost it's grip on reality too, but not as the makers must have intended, I suppose. It's very threadbare idea unwound before your very eyes like a tennis ball, and the core with all of the bouncy bouncy energy fell to the floor and splat: was revealed as putty. Not the silly kind.Where Zoolander went wrong was told the same gag told time after bleeding time... the preening, the preening, the preening. Could it have been so difficult to come up with, oh let's make it easy, two more gags? Then you could, like a punk band fueled with naught but testosterone and a modicum of talent, varied them enough to mine some gold in that great honking nose?Zoolander's pathos was worn on it's sleeve; there was nothing subtle about it. The makers had some passing affection for their mentally challenged characters, but instead of the Dunaway movie, which went for the melodrama of the pretty woman coming unglued (with all the accompanying self-importance of that generation of film-making), they went for the yucks. Hey, I can't deny there were one or two chuckles. I want to let these guys clown around. We must encourage the Stillers and (the other guy)s of the world to have them make more laughs for us, the adoring audience.
But alas, it's wasted effort, and even this more than forgiving observer would have to recommend you give it a pass... ...unless your under 18 and have all the time in the world.1.

NOBODY is THAT dumb.The whole thing with 'Blue Steel' and the other four or five 'looks' that were ALL THE SAME was a bit much for me. It wasn't funny, just plain stupid. And the issue of the files being in the computer and their spending all that time trying to figure out how to PHYSICALLY REMOVE them...and then that guy dropping the computer to get them out? I mean COME ON!!! I'm not a stick-in-the-mud or anything, but I can't deal with such blatant stupidity. And the few things I chuckled at in this film were corny rather than funny; the only reason I did chuckle was that I'd never heard anything cornier.The best thing was the fact that so many celebrities had cameos in it, and then at the end their baby was really cute.

260,cunningpal,Also for People Who Read Good,7,9 August 2006,"This movie has a somewhat unlikely hero, a male supermodel named Derek Zoolander. He will eventually be programmed by evil-doers to assassinate the Prime Minister of Malaysia. He really isn't too bright, and his stunning beauty is apparent only to himself and a surprising number of admirers (""He's almost ... too good looking"", ""It's like there's a light around him"") who don't notice that his special facial expressions, his ""looks"", are all identical. He loses a model contest to a rival, Hansel, but doesn't notice, and accepts the prize anyway. By the time his faux pas reaches Time magazine's cover, he is becoming aware that all is not well. There's lots of wacky and grossly outrageous humor, situations, and action in the film, which only loses momentum a bit before the climactic wild and zany grunge fashion show scene, with Derek alternately hyper-athletically modeling, and trying to murder the Prime Minister. When shown a model of a school he proposes to establish for children who don't read too good, Derek hurls it to the floor; even he knows it has to be at least three times bigger for anyone to fit inside! If you get a laugh from that, you'll probably like the movie. Ben Stiller as Derek may be the chief actor whose personality and ability make this film watchable and enjoyable. The DVD has some funny outtakes, and an excellent short on modeling from the Derek Zoolander University of Modeling for Men.

This movie is not to be taken seriously, its for FUN, people. The movie's main characters did great jobs, and had good charisma between them, there were tons of other actors putting in small bits (some of which were amazingly funny, I laughed out loud in a few parts, and I almost never do that). There were some truly funny moments, moments I found much funnier than I thought the film would be. When I told friends and family I saw it they all said, `You did?' when I said I liked it they said with even more incredulity, `You did?!' because I don't like certain kinds of stupid humor. I liked the Three Amigos, but hated Austin Powers. Potty humor doesn't do it for me. But this movie was surprisingly witty and funny without thinking it had to be disgusting to be humorous.

266,srella,enjoyably inane,8,8 November 2001,"Last year's Meet the Parents already proved to the world that the combination of Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson was funny. Zoolander shows that the two of them can be downright hilarious.But be on the alert, schoolmarms: Zoolander is not a movie that wants to be taken seriously. There's nothing in the movie that even comes close to believability, let alone drama. However, this does not stop Zoolander from being incredibly enjoyable.Ben Stiller plays Derek Zoolander, a male model who is really, really, really, really good-looking (which is, given Stiller's cute doofiness, a funny gag all in itself). Unfortunately, like most male models, Derek is also a complete moron. For this reason, he is chosen by Mugatu, an evil fashion designer, to assassinate the newly elected prime minister of Malaysia. Why would the fashion industry care about third world politics? Well, once in power, the new prime minister will put an end to the practices of child labor in his country. Since the fashion industry thrives on cheap child labor, they need to stop the prime minister. And Zoolander, more beauty than brains, is just the man to do it.Sound ridiculous? That's because it is. But don't worry. Zoolander never focuses too much on the plot. Rather, it chooses to belittle and mock the modeling industry, and it does so with a combination of gusto and hilarity. Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller do a wonderful job of imitating the cocky arrogance of male models, while at the same time somehow making their characters likable.Wilson, who broke out into stardom with the Jackie Chan vehicle Shanghai Noon, is wonderful as Hansel, the male model who threatens to unseat Zoolander from the perch of male model superstar. Will Ferrell as Mugatu is as hysterical as ever -- especially in the ""brainwashing"" scene. And Christine Taylor, as TIME magazine reporter Matilda Jeffries, is also likable. The inclusion of Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara (Ben Stiller's parents) in small parts in the film, is the icing on the cake.Is it up for Oscar contention? Good god, I hope not. Zoolander is a ridiculous movie, with more material missing from it than from the latest designer's dress. It's not as much a movie as it is an hour and a half of silly sketch comedy. But for a hearty laugh -- as well as a good escape from the scary chaos of the world today -- Zoolander should walk down the runway the winner.

276,auslander11,The most idiotic premise ever.,1,28 May 2007,"While it is, of course, the job of an actor to act, there are certain things that just can't be done. Without straining the ability to suspend disbelief, for example, you could not have Oprah Winfrey play the biological mother of Haley Joel Osment. Having Bernie Mac play JFK would be another stretch that's pretty much unimaginable. And the idea of having Ben Stiller or Owen Wilson play male models is on the same level.Some people might say that that's the point - it's inherently funny to have a man who resembles a chimpanzee and a man with half a nose playing models. That might be true, were it not for the fact that Ben Stiller, Jerry Stiller and Owen Wilson have, between them all, the comedic talents of a stale animal cracker. The only plus to this movie was Will Ferrell - that's it.I have no idea what a person might find funny about Zoolander - clearly some people find it endlessly amusing, even some of my friends - but I can't, in good conscience, recommend it to anyone that I don't want to see commit suicide. If you really want to experience something that nearly emulates the amount of pain this movie will inflict without having to spend over an hour watching it, may I advise the following?Go duck hunting with Dick Cheney. Have an intimate encounter with a food processor. Dip your most sensitive bits in gravy and tease a rabid wolverine. Hug a wrecking ball (in use). Apply for a job brushing the teeth of great white sharks.Any of these will allow you to experience the sheer mental torture that ""Zoolander"" will inflict on you without actually having to invest the time in watching Ben Stiller 'act'.",Zoolander

281,zazoomovie,Nice directing and performance by Ben Stiller.,6,5 February 2002,"I became a fan of Ben Stiller only recently, after watching him as a guest in the program called `Inside The Actor's Studio' produced by James Lipton. He was so likeable and naturally funny. When asked if being funny was a skill or a gift, he replied that he didn't know how you could teach somebody to be funny. Before that, I had seen him in: There's Something About Mary and Meet The Parents. At that time, I was more interested in watching Cameron Diaz or Robert De Niro's performances.In his previous movies, Ben Stiller would portray a nice but unlucky guy, so incredibly unlucky that it was unnerving. With Zoolander, he remains a nice guy, but instead of being incredibly unlucky, he becomes a victim. He is no longer the hero - lacking super human powers though - who has to face adverse circumstances to achieve his goal (conquer the woman that he loves, or her family for that matter). In Zoolander, he is a kind of anti-hero who had no goal whatsoever (apart from having absolute FUN  even at the cost of human lives), until his fame shakes and he becomes a target of a dreadful manipulation...I'd say, if you are NOT a fan of Ben Stiller; or if you are a fan of the Ben Stiller of his previous movies; or if you expect the comedy genre to be witty and high-brow, stay home and wait until it's available on video to rent Zoolander. You'll have a good time if you keep your mind open and want to relax one evening.Derek Zoolander has only the look for him, and a big heart  but other than that, he is VERY stupid. In fact, he is a caricature, meaning that his character is based on real life traits. But those real traits are found in various persons. For the purpose of the caricature, they are mixed together in one character and distorted with great exaggeration. As a result, people are fooled: they think that someone like Derek Zoolander cannot be found out there in the real world, nor either of the other characters in the movie.I especially liked the opening scene in the warehouse, where they plan to kill the Malaysian Prime Minister and state the reasons why he is a threat to the industry. I also liked the shots for Derek Zoolander's first appearance, through the journalist Matilda Jeffries. There is a suspense that was nicely built up: what is he going to look like?! Another of my favorite scenes was the brainwashing scene, where he is made to believe that the children themselves claim for their rights to be able to work in the factories. And I found the new historical perspective on Lincoln and Kennedy assassinations very funny.Because the whole thing is a true FARCE  nobody feels threatened, very rare are the people who will gain a new insight, a fresh outlook on what our everyday world is made of, how we contribute to model it by the choices or non-choices that we make. So all is well, we are safe and we still have fun!I found the theme of the movie very enticing: the modeling/fashion industry, and featuring a male model in a ridiculous manner is a great idea. The directing by Ben Stiller was good. There was a good pace and the movie moved along smoothly. The only thing I missed was more `insights' on the modeling industry, such as the flashback Derek Zoolander had on pretending to be a monkey during a photo shoot. The David Bowie cameo appearance was very nicely done.Some people didn't like the fact that Zoolander appeared as a kind of `family movie', with Ben Stiller's Dad (Jerry Stiller as Maury Ballstein) and his wife (Christine Taylor as Matilda Jeffries) play supporting roles. Jerry Stiller was perfect for the role and great in this movie. Christine Taylor was OK, but to me, she failed to inspire a special feeling for this female journalist (good girl/bad girl?). Maybe the script was at fault, but as a talented actress, she should have been able to carve an unforgettable character for Matilda Jeffries. Think about Milla Jovovich's performance as Katinka. She was absolutely fantastic. We need more striking performances for female leads  which are unfortunately still too rare on the screen.I gave it 7 out of 10.",Zoolander

Ben is a comic genius (it's in his blood) and too many folks try to pick apart his movies because he is ""quirky"" and operates on a different mental level than most others in his comedic writing/directing style. I hope that Ben continues to make, star in and direct movies HIS way - because the talent is obvious to those who see beyond traditional ""comedic acting"" and understand his zany sense of humor. Duchovny's part was genius! Owen Wilson - hilarious! And as for slamming Will Farrel - get a life ! How silly and funny is he in this movie? Look at his hairdo!

The second time I out and out laughed.,7,29 January 2003,"Zoolander satisfies all the requirements of a complete story: A beginning, a middle, and a satisfying end... all presented in the regulation three-act format to which we have all become accustomed. Heck, there's even a good back-story, and that's more than can be said for much of what we're exposed to these days. When a director manages to get all of that onto the screen then he or she has accomplished something noteworthy.When a film touches its audience in exactly the way the director intended then that film is a success. There is no doubt that Ben Stiller intended Zoolander to be a farce... nothing more and nothing less... give the audience a good dose of the giggles and leave it at that. From where I sit Zoolander is an excellent example of the modern-day farce.Like most of us, I have a higher than warranted opinion of myself and I like to think that I'm predisposed to preferring *intellectual* comedy as opposed to slapstick. (Just when did society officially decide to demean slapstick?) So the first time I saw Zoolander I just sort of chuckled at all the right places. But afterwards I thought about the film a bit and realized that it was indeed a complete story and not just a collection of gags. So off to the rental house I went...I'm not sure how many times I've seen Zoolander to date, but I do know that in order for me to watch a film so often that there has got to be something to it. Whatever that something is, Zoolander has got it. And director Ben Stiller knew how to put it there.This film is worth seeing several times.",Zoolander

293,gregherk,Zoolander is stupid funny!,8,21 October 2001,"Derek Zoolander is stupid. So is his movie. But by no means, is Zoolander humorless. Directed by and starring Ben Stiller, Zoolander is a very funny movie, if you know what to expect. Based on a character that Stiller created for the 1996 VH1 Fashion Awards, Derek Zoolander was originally intended to satirize the fashion industry. The movie does no less and as a result, has received some very negative patron reviews. Audiences went into Zoolander expecting another Ben Stiller, Meet the Parents-type comedy, and when they got an offbeat movie about the fashion industry's plot to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia, they didn't know how to react. To enjoy Zoolander, one has to forget all expectations and see the movie for what it is supposed to be: ridiculous.Derek Zoolander (Stiller) is the fashion industry's number one male model, but his career is slouching and boy beauty Hansel (Owen Wilson) provides tough competition. Fashion designer Mugatu (Will Ferrell) takes advantage of this and Zoolander's stupidity, and brainwashes him to kill the Malaysian prime minister, after he put an end to vital fashion industry sweatshops. The talented cast and an excellent soundtrack add absurdity to the already farcical plot. Zoolander gives both Ferrell and Wilson the opportunity to do what they do best. For Saturday Night Live's Ferrell that is embracing and developing the demented, while for Meet the Parents' Wilson, it is the chance to play a comedic, confident, character role. Stiller's father and wife also appear in supporting roles, with Jerry Stiller as Maury Ballstein, Derek's agent, and Christine Taylor as Matilda Jeffries, a TIME magazine reporter. Jerry Stiller, like Wilson, always manages to find humor in every role he plays, and in Zoolander this remains especially true. Taylor, being a veteran of the Brady Bunch movies, is not stranger to satire either. Well-chosen and placed music adds laughs and heightens the tone and feel of the movie. With songs ranging from Wham!'s `Wake Me Up Before You Go Go' playing as cruising music for Derek and his male model friends, and Michael Jackson's `Beat It' as the background music for a face-off between Derek and Hansel, any remaining seriousness is diminished. And yet even more surprise and absurdity is added by the many unexpected cast members and cameo appearances. Others appearing in Zoolander include David Duchovny, Jon Voight, Vince Vaughn, Andy Dick, David Bowie, Cuba Gooding Jr., Winona Ryder, and even Ralph Lauren's own male model, Tyson Beckford. I can understand people disliking this movie; it is temperamental. This is the kind of movie that varies depending on the audience and a person's expectation. Generally though, if you keep an open mind and realize that it is not meant to be serious in any way, your view of the movie shouldn't go anywhere but up. Zoolander is absurd, ridiculous, and overall, an incredibly stupid movie. I suggest you see it.",Zoolander

Hansel a role written for Owen Wilson by Ben Stiller is a hippie like model whose career is rising. After losing the model of the year to Hansel he reconsider if there anything besides being really really good looking and retire. Looking for a model to assassinated the prime minister Magatu hires Derek Zoolander for a new fashion line and brainwashing to the song ""Relax"".Ben Stiller's movie about stereotypical male model with a ridiculous story makes an entertaining comedy making fun of the male model industry. A stupid plot with good supporting cast combine with good soundtrack.

But the whole movie is spoiled anyway with it's way too predictable plot international intrigue and silly facial contortions. Derek Zoolander is based on a character Stiller created for the VH1 fashion awards and perhaps that's where he should've stayed.  I like Stiller a lot better when he plays mild-mannered characters who get into hilarious trouble like in `Something About Mary' or `Meet the Parents.'

Ben Stiller plays Derek Zoolander, a legendary male model who made male modeling what it is today. He plays his part pretty convincing and is truly funny. Owen Wilson plays the part of Hansel, a young upcoming model and competitor of Derek. Christine Taylor plays Matilda Jeffries, a reporter for Time Magazine. Will Ferrell plays a great role as the bad guy of the movie, Mugatu, an evil fashion designer and former member of ""Frankie goes to Hollywood"" before the became famous with their huge hit ""Relax"" and then there's his female helper Milla Jovovich as Katinka Ingabogovinanana. All of these roles are played great by the actors. There are a lot of small roles who are played great as well. David Duchovny plays a former hand model :). Jon Voight plays Derek's mining father and Jerry Stiller plays Derek's Agent (or something like that). Lots of cameos are included too. Look for: Donald Trump, Christian Slater, Cuba Gooding Jr., Tommy Hilfiger, Natalie Portman, Fabio, Lenny Kravitz, Gwen Stefani, Heidi Klum, David Bowie, Fred Durst, Lil' Kim, Stephen Dorff, Claudia Schiffer, Billy Zane, Victoria Beckham, Emma Bunton, Winona Rider and probably lots of celebrities I didn't know.The music in the movie is great too. It has all those great eighties hits in it like the aforementioned relax, wake me up before you go-go etc. It has some nice sound effects in it too.Probably the best part of the movie is how it looks. The sets and environments look truly great. The clothing is absolutely brilliant and the hair of the actors and actresses is great too.The one, HUGE flaw the movie has is it's scenario. Although the male model idea is great it doesn't fulfill it's true potential. There are far to few (good) jokes in it as there should have been. I'm not saying it should be loaded with jokes as an over the top comedy but they could have put some more in it. The lack of jokes makes it an enjoyable movie but not merely funny enough. After the approximately 90 minutes you'll not be disappointed and think you've wasted your time but it's still not as good as it should have been.My score: 7/10",Zoolander

306,Splintercelldude,Funny if you are into it,8,4 January 2005,"Let me say first that this is probably my most favorite Ben Stiller movie to date. It of course has limited appeal due to its someone weird sense of humor, lots of stupid jokes, etc... etc...Basically, it is about Derek Zoolander, a male model, who has lost everything that he had (which is pretty much one award) and is then brainwashed to kill the Malaysian prime minister. In the end, he doesn't due to a odd twist of event, and if has VERY stupid ending. He pulls oh his ""super"" look called Magnum which magically stops a throwing star from kill the prime minister.Over all, the plot kinda... sucks, but the humor is good for those who like it.8/10",Zoolander
307,armandinjo,Not a comedy?,6,7 August 2021,"I love this movie, but I don't find it funny. Instead, I think Zoolander is an excellent (although quite satyrical) take on the modelling and fashion industry, which is what makes it entertaining. Of course what the movie shows isn't reality, but as someone who is heavily invested in the industry I appreciate Zoolander a lot. Although the industry creates and forms beautiful, creative art and artist, it's also very toxic. The character of Derek Zoolander brilliantly represents how mind-numbing modelling can be, and having Matilda be the way in for the audience is quite effective. The ending, whilst not ruining the movie, doesn't help it, its a bit too much and somewhat weighs down the quality of the film. Zoolander is not an excellent movie, its not very funny, the ending isn't good, but its still very much worth the watch.",Zoolander

To begin with, Stiller is probably the worst comediant that has ever lived, he truly, truly sucks big time, though, not all of his movies are horrible. I'm saying this to be clear about the fact that this is not a bad review because I have a personal problem with Stiller, aside from that, this particular movie lacks creativity, lacks humor, has absolutely no script what so ever, the acting is unbelievably bad and has one of the worst secuences in cinema history, which is the so called ""modeling duel"". I'm simply shocked and amazed about how little something can offer and still become a hit.",Zoolander

This was an interesting experience for me because I have no real interest in male modelling and know very little about the subject.Despite this, I enjoyed it. The plot goes somewhat like this. Derek Zoolander, famous male model, is humiliated when his enemy, Hansel, wins the award he was aiming for. When his friends try to cheer him up, they all die in an explosion. Meenwhile, evil fashion designer Mugatu, is plotting to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia for his new policy against sweatshops, and he needs, Derek Zoolaner, the single stupidest male model in existence, to do it for him.Zoolander, Hansel and Mugatu are two of the funniest characters I have ever seen. The other characters though, are a little bland. I don't hate them, I just think they're a little bit boring.All in all, a good movie with a funny main lead, original premise, but some slightly boring support characters.",Zoolander

It is a movie that makes me want to puke until I am dead.Seriously though this movie lacked a few things.  While having plenty of cameos and famous people it did not have any of the following:1.

Also the appearance of DavidBowie was cool, but this is by far the dumbest movie I have ever seen. It was full of offensive humor. The story line was dumb.

It's an excellent film for people with a bizarre and surreal sense of humour, but normal people would definitely get some sort of satisfaction out of it too.

Don't get scared by other reviewers saying this a mock of the fashion industry, that's just a small part of the movie (these people don't get it). Watch the movie at least three times before you decide if you like it, it's on TBS/TNT/USA all the time so you should have no problem seeing it almost on demand (there's a reason it's on TV so often, IT's FUNNY!)

I was hoping for a few laughs (which I honestly did get in the end), but I ended up having to sit through a giant lump of crap.I am a big Ben Stiller fan, and Will Ferrell fan, and Owen Wilson fan, but why the hell would they make a movie like this? This is the kind of crap that Sacha Baron Cohen would make, but when he does it I actually laugh throughout most of the movie.

328,tkjohns131,"Pretty Underwhelming (Warning, stream of consciousness)",4,23 June 2016,"So, Zoolander. I'm really unimpressed so far. There a couple of good moments, but I'm not liking the main point. To be fair, I could just be a bit of a prude or whatever, but I'm not really feeling it. It doesn't help that this movie has been hyped to all hell. I mean, I could definitely get into a movie like Anchorman, but it's pretty simplistic and whatnot. I mean, not a really fan of any of the characters. Derek has some good qualities, in his desire to help the children, but it just seems like an easy way to make him a somewhat relatable character, and abandon it early after it brings him back. The backstory with his family seems pretty predictable, though I'm sure they'll do something with it by the end. Hansel is kind of a cool guy I guess, but there's not much to him. Also, Derek and Hansel are so dumb, it kind of takes away from the plot. I mean, the whole computer joke was telegraphed to all hell, though it didn't help that it's part of the movie that I believe I've seen before. Matilda's there, for some reason. I mean, just to kind of give that one lady her ""lady comeuppance,"" and that is kind of stupid. I mean, also for some weird bulimia jokes, some no sex jokes, and for Derek. I mean, I don't want to get SJW on this, but not exactly gonna pass any Bechdel tests (or just the 1, I guess). With Maury running around, none of the women have a particularly nice time of it anyway, I guess. Will Ferrell is probably the best part, and he's only all right.If nothing else, the plot is kind of fun. I mean, it's interesting at least. And some of the jokes work pretty well; probably the best would be Will Ferrell's crazy dancing in the hypnotizing scene, and during the credits as well. The quotable ones were possibly the most disappointing, though. ""Crazy Pills,"" and ""a building for ants,"" were pretty telegraphed for those who knew it was coming, and if you didn't know about them from general internet culture, I feel as though they wouldn't be as significant or useful.As a last ditch effort, I'd like to try to gain some respect for it by putting myself in the shoes of the movie, and trying to see what the point/purpose/goal was, a la Movie Bob. To spitball, and see if I can find it, I could assume general entertainment, some satire, owed to the eating disorders, general vapid nature of the models, and corruption of the fashion industry. I don't know much about the time of this movie being out, but I can't really think of anything late 90s or early 00s. All in all, pretty underwhelming.",Zoolander
329,queviva,What a waste of my time.,3,9 September 2006,"To be honest, the main reason I rented this movie was that people quote it all the time, and I never understand what they're referring to (and usually, oft-quoted movies are very entertaining, such as Anchorman or Tommy Boy). Now having seen it, I still don't know why people quote this movie. I rented the movie knowing full well that I have never liked Ben Stiller in any movie I've seen him in. This movie was completely laugh-less for me, except for one part I can't quite recall (might've been the part where Zoolander and Hansel were trying to use the computer).The only bright point for this movie was the cast (except for Stiller and Wilson). I thought making Jerry Stiller Zoolander's agent was a great choice, and the tons of celebrity cameos I felt were wasted on such a bad movie (Paris Hilton, Natalie Portman, Fred Durst, Lance Bass, and ESPECIALLY David Bowie). In fact, 2 of the three stars I'm giving it are for all the cameos, because I love me some cameos.All in all, a terribly disappointing movie.",Zoolander
330,suresh_raj92,Zoolander: the film and the character are not so different,7,6 January 2015,"Ben Stiller directs and stars as Derek Zoolander, a supermodel failing to come to grips with a career in decline. He has only one pose, is unable to turn left and sports a pout throughout. Most importantly, he is completely stupid, just like the whole movie, but that does not limit either from being amusing at times and harmlessly fun. Zoolander's satire on the fashion industry is hardly subtle and as this tires, the wafer thin plot is barely able to keep proceedings together. Inevitably the laughs dry up but moviegoers are more likely to be kept on their toes by an amiable supporting cast that includes the likes of Owen Wilson and Will Ferrell as well as a very, very long list of celebrity cameos. This is not Stiller's strongest but look more closely and you can see the seeds of the brilliant Tropic Thunder being planted.",Zoolander

The collaboration with Owen Wilson and Will Ferrell, that we can find also in ""Starsky & Hutch"", is unbelievable! Comicity, irony, gags are the essence of this movie, based on the life of a model at the end of his career, Derek Zoolander, that has been recruit, after a brainwash, to kill the Prime Minister of Malaysia.

341,clwill76,"God, it makes me laugh!",10,3 February 2007,"Obviously it does not take much to make me laugh. This is actually the only movie DVD that I own, purchased for therapy reasons. Although Ben Stiller really puts it all out (esp. in the stretching and underwear scenes during the walk-off), I think Will Ferrell is the one that gets me the most. My newest, greatest favorite line is, ""I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!,"" considering that I do have a history of taking anti-depressant medication that really just worsened my life. His little run across the room to the ""Center for Kids. .."" model in high heels is the greatest. And the ""foamy latte"" scene is not only funny for the use of the words ""bloated"" and ""farty"" but because his assistant, Todd, is a real scream too. Christine Taylor has got to be the most non-egoistic actress I've ever seen on screen. She manages to basically just play herself, which I don't think I see very often in films (or maybe I don't know a lot of actors well enough). They do beautiful makeup jobs on her, too. In all, she is beautiful and clean and all-American. Some of her expressions/reactions to things that Derek says are really funny. Is Billy Zane the same guy who was in ""Titanic?"" He looks awesome with his head shaved- great physique. I love and respect movies that involve a tremendous amount of creative collaboration, and if you just look at the number of celebrities on the full cast list, it is quite impressive. Funny how Winona Ryder just got kind of stuck in there. Maybe this is also a feel-good movie for me because it was basically a family collaboration (Ben and Jerry Stiller, Christine Taylor)--I can't imagine my father-in-law telling me that I would have ""a nice rack of lamb"" if I used a push-up bra, on or off-screen.",Zoolander

343,noti_nu,How stupid does Ben Stiller think we are?,2,3 January 2002,"BEWARE! GREAT BIG SPOILER! (Especially for Stiller fans)Indeed. How stupid does Ben Stiller actually think his paying audience is? 'Zoolander' is THE worst film I have seen in a very long time. Considering that Mr. Stiller has done some really good comedy, one might like to think that the film could have been extremely funny, since the idea of using the fashion industry as a frame for a comedy does indeed have a lot of potential. However, what was a good concept turned into a film full of unoriginal slapstick, clichés, one-dimensional characters and dialogues bordering on cretinism. Who ever told Mr. Stiller that outright stupidity was funny? Isn't it the very essence of comedy to present us with more-or-less normal, everyday characters - people one can identify with - who find themselves in situations which, once again, one might be likely to experience onesself? In short, isn't it just about caring for the characters and feeling with them? Mr. Stiller, however, preferred to exaggerate a potentially lovable and dim yet good-hearted character, thereby turning him into a more- than-anything-else stupid, stupid, stupid character hardly anyone could care less about. And a character I couldn't care less about is just plain boring. And bored I was. I waited in vain for something resembling a catharsis at the end, just to make me feel the film hadn't been an utter waste of time and money, but any hint of character development obviously was not the prerogative of 'Zoolander'. (A comparison with 'Legally Blonde' might be appropriate at this point, as the main characters could be seen as being similar. However the ""dumb blonde"" played by Reese Witherspoon sets out to achieve something, learns and matures through the course of the film, and turns out to be not quite the dim-wit she seemed. Derek Zoolander on the other hand constantly confirms our hunch that he might possibly be a complete and utter moron.) So, add to all this a weak plot, lack of suspense, overacted and stereotypical characters and a kind of banal humour which can only be seen as an insult to any adult and you have 'Zoolander', a film I would not even bother watching on TV.  Not even if I were bed-ridden for a month, with 39° fever, no good books around and nothing better to do. Sorry, but not even in such a situation would I want to be taken for a fool.",Zoolander

At least for me.But beware - this movie may not satisfy most viewers. You'll need to know at least the fashion industry basics if you are to be amused by the wacky insane plot involving top models, sweatshops, lots of vanity and a global conspiracy to murder the prime minister of Malesia (or ""the Klamatian dude"", to quote one of the funniest lines in the script). If you've ever met models, read trendy fashion magazines or had the opportunity to attend fashion shows' after parties, you'll be screaming with hysterical laughter from the opening scene until the end. If you weren't that (un)lucky in your life, you might find the movie a wee bit silly and not entirely too amusing.I saw Zoolander for the first time with several friends. One of them worked as a fashion photographer, the other as his producer - they were absolutely delighted, and started using quotes from the movie in daily life.

Good quality humor is hard to come across these days (or D-E-A-Y-E-S as Derek Zoolander would put it) and films like this one are simply godsend.  Don't expect ""Meet the parents"" or ""There's someting about Mary"".  Zoolander goes waaay beyond those in stupidity and yet it manages to be every bit as funny.  If you haven't seen it yet, don't rent it expecting anything. Just watch it and enjoy it on its own terms.",Zoolander

I think people should go into this film with some respect for it and they'll enjoy it more. We own it on dvd and it's the funniest movie ever.
plot cohesiveness? meh. i think the plot is just fine. i guess my favourite movies have plots that dont really hold togther well, eg 'the emperor's new groove' (my other favourite comedy).Anyway this has got to be the most quotable movie ever. 'What is this? A center for ants?! How can we be expected to teach children to learn how to read if they can't even fit inside the building?'

If there was any industry tailor made (no pun intended) for spoofing, it's the fashion industry. This movie is hilariously quotable, and the cameos alone are reason enough to watch it.
Owen Wilson is always funny, and here is no exception. My favorite scenes (which change after every viewing) are the walk off (with hilarious cameos from david bowie, in a priceless freeze frame, and tyson beckford)and Mugatu's frustrated tirade at the end. It's kinda hard to not be funny when your frustrated to the point of yelling.",Zoolander
352,comftabiiil,More than meets the eye,10,5 March 2003,"The best advice I can give anyone is to anyone is give this movie a chance. Don't go into it expecting your run of the mill Jim Carrey slapstick routine, although if that is all you want you will not be disappointed. Much of this movie relies on how (un)smart the character dialogue is. In my opinion it is the small details that raises this movie above other slapstick comedy's. Pay special attention to facial expressions other than ""magnum"" etc. Stiller's face after he has stumbled through a sentence is priceless. The supporting cast is excellent as well. Ferrell as Mugatu and Wilson as Hansel are priceless. One warning it will be impossible to take Owen Wilson seriously in any other movie after seeing Zoolander. Great film for all ages, silly and smart at the same time and definitely underrated. And don't forget the DVD outakes, Mugatu especially.",Zoolander

I saw it a second time with some different friends and liked it much more, I caught a few more lines, and it really hit me how ridiculously outrageous the movie really is. I then saw it a third, fourth, fifteenth, etc time :) I will now have to say this is probably my favorite comedy of all time. I love Ben Stiller's humor, his expressions, and his reactions during the movie. I also love Owen Wilson's part as Hansel, I think the carelessness of both actor's in this movie make it a great movie to veg out to after a hard day's work.

354,magictalon,hit or miss depending on viewer,8,25 November 2002,"Hilarious movie with Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. The two together, like in Meet the Parents, fit very well with each other. The concept of the movie on the whole is entertaining. It kind of gives a glimpse into the seedy underworld of fashion, much like Death to Smoochy did for children's shows. So anyway, you really need to have an appreciation for subtleness and irony, otherwise you should not really watch it, because you most likely not enjoy it. Most characters in the movie are based on their previous acting careers, so you sort of need to be up on pop-culture or have watched a large amount of movies and TV. Some funny scenes are the gasoline fight and the walk-off. There are numerous gags within the movie, some recurring which are subtle: the small cellphone, the derelict(e) campaign, Zoolander's ""one look"", crazy hippie stylings of Owen Wilson, the inability for the models to understand the computer, and the breakdance fight. I rate it a 10 because I can understand it.",Zoolander

It's almost indescribable how ridiculous (ridiculous as in really really goofy/silly) Zoolander is. I'm not big on Ben Stiller's work. I disliked both ""Meet the"" films, and I didn't like ""Dodgeball"". But he was...amazing in this movie.This is what comedy should be all about. It's surely a movie that you could quote on forever. And what really makes it unique is that if you enjoy the jokes, and get a feel for the goofy atmosphere, you really don't care about the story. In fact, you SHOULDN'T care. Ben Stiller shows that through his eyes as a director. It's very hard to find a decent/creative comedy these days. This film is certainly underrated.

361,mcnulty-chris,A great film that delivers lots of laughs,8,6 September 2013,"Zoolander is definitely one of my favorite comedies. It is a feel-good, cleverly-written film that will leave a majority of viewers satisfied. The acting is great, and the story flows well--overall a very solid comedy. Ben Stiller plays Derek Zoolander, a male model who is far from the sharpest tool in the shed, which is showcased in the most hilarious of ways. Suddenly, Derek's world as THE top model is disrupted when Hansel, brilliantly played by Owen Wilson, arrives on the scene and disrupts Zoolander's throne with Hansel's seemingly effortless, avant garde approach to male modeling.This is my very first review, so I apologize for the lack of well-articulated perspective. What I can tell you is that this movie is hilarious and absolutely worth a viewing.This really should be in the 7 - 8 range on IMDb.This film is definitely worth a watch.Enjoy!",Zoolander
362,avengerscap,I don't care if they're married in real life: Stiller & Taylor have ZERO chemistry,2,27 September 2006,"One of the worst movies ever. The acting is actually worse than the substandard writing. Christine Taylor, who rolls her eyes and sneers throughout, amazingly has the power to ruin every single scene she's in. Will Ferrel's disturbingly homely face and corseted physique come in a close second. The real problem is that Stiller is about as far from model prettiness as you can get. There's only so much the willing suspension of disbelief can go: He's not a good-looking man, and his one exaggerated facial expression (pouting lips, wrinkled brow) has worn out any comic value is had five minutes into the movie. The rest of the film limps along to its ridiculous conclusion, in which Zoolander's ""new look"" saves the Prime Minister of Malaysia. Owen Wilson and Milla Jovovich are the movie's only saving graces. A slow-motion orgy late in the film seems misplaced and a valid embarrassment for everyone except Stiller and Tyler.",Zoolander
363,gahrjack,Hilarious! My favorite movie!,10,17 May 2014,"Zoolander makes no sense whatsoever. But the jokes are hilarious, and you will never forget this movie. Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller), an immensely famous yet immensely dumb male model at the end of his career, is brainwashed to kill the prime minister of Malaysia, by one of the only people who never hired him, Mugatu (Will Ferrell). So he needs the help of TIME reporter Matilda Jeffries (Christine Taylor), and rival model Hansel (Owen Wilson) to help keep him from destroying the prime minister. With great performances from all the actors, including Jerry Stiller as Maury Ballstein, Derek's mentor, this will be remembered as a classic (at least by me)!",Zoolander
364,herman-ellert,a life changing experience,8,14 January 2015,"What a bold, mad act of genius it was to make ""Zoolander"", or even think that it could be made. In a perfect world, ""Zoolander"" would exist solely as a depiction of darker days long since past, an American history lesson that concludes with reassurances that its horrors will no longer be perpetrated, tolerated nor celebrated. Alas, perfection eludes us on this mortal, earthly plane; ""Zoolander"" shows the evolution of change while beaming a spotlight on the stunted growth of that which has not changed. Its timeliness is a spine-chilling reminder that those who do not know their history are doomed to repeat it. Its story provides a blueprint not only of the past, but of the way forward. Derek Zoolander must be the strangest hero to ever stand at the center of an epic. To play him, Stiller cast one of the strangest actors in recent movie history, Ben Stiller, a lanky, almost clumsy man with a sculptured face and a speaking manner that hesitates between amusement and insolence. Stillers's assignment was a delicate one.I've noticed that when people remember ""Zoolander"" they don't talk about the plot. They get a certain look in their eye, as if they are remembering the whole experience and have never quite been able to put it into words.",Zoolander
365,jordan-156,I'm diggin' Zoolander!!,9,10 August 2005,"Zoolander is stupidly funny, with stars such as Ben Stiller, Will Ferell, Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, with numerous cameos by big celebrities. Before there was 'Old School', 'Dodgeball', 'Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy' and 'Wedding Crashers', there was Zoolander. I like to say it kick started the dumb-hilarious-pee your pants-comedies of the 21st century.Our hero, the misunderstood and um, lacking in brain cells, male model Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) is at the height of his career, when things suddenly start to go downhill. There's a hot new male model with a very different look, the hippie-chick Hansel (Owen Wilson) and a pretty, but stuck up journalist, Matilda(Christine Taylor) has just written and unflattering article about him. Then Hansel wins the 'Male Model of the Year' award. And his best friends die in a, um, tragic gasoline accident. Poor, Poor Derek.Little does he know, things are about to get worse. Evil Mugato (Will Ferell with a hilarious white fluffy wig and matching poodle), fashion god of the city, has an evil plan. He proceeds to hypnotise Derek and persuade him to- gasp- assassinate the Prime Minister of Malaysia!! By the time Matilda gets to the scene of the crime, it's too late. So here's the plot- she must STOP him from killing the poor old Malaysian dude at a big fashion event. Da-du-daaaaaw.Along the way, Derek pays an unwelcome visit to his (literally) golddiggin' hometown (featuring a cameo by Vince Vaughn), parties with celebs (Cameos by Paris Hilton, Billy Zane and David Bowie), befriends the enemy and even falls in love along the way.

I assumed it would be dumb - and it is - but it a way that's genuinely funny. Ben Stiller, his dad, and his mother in a cameo are all great.But it's Owen Wilson who caught my eye. This is a guy that has the same kind of good looks, intelligence and charm that some of the best comedic actors of years gone by had. His broken nose only adds to his persona. He writes, too. I hope he continues both his acting and writing career. I've read that he does a lot of improvising, and that some of his best lines are off the cuff. This is a hallmark of someone who is truly funny, with great timing.The scenes where he prances & struts (on his skateboard & off) are perfect. He plays the fool, who is actually not a fool, to perfection.The many cameos in this movies are fun. I recognized several of them, and so will you. I rated this movies a 7 instead of higher only because the theme gets pretty trivial and silly at times.",Zoolander

It has a cunning mix of both humour and satirical stupidity that merges into a well developed film that appeals to a wide ranged audience. Characters are brilliantly played by both Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson who go on personal journeys from being the worst of rivals to becoming the best of friends. Ben Stiller also hads to the film with his brilliant directing and writing skills to add his twist to humour that extends the films appeal.

It perfectly portrays socio-economic trends and, despite offering a wide variety of parody within the male model characteristic, breaks the stereotypical views of male modelling, by showing even they are imperfect by, for example, having the inability to turn left.

He has found the perfect balance between silly and smart. He satirizes male models that they are all stupid and need someone to tell them what to do. They pay out on models so much that some may take offense at the movie, but for everyone else it is absolutely hilarious. Lines like Derek's eulogy or ""elgoogly"" at Rufus, Meekus and Brint's funeral really is some great script writing. They use Binary opposition as well, in genders.

Zoolander was funny sometimes, but Ben's ""look"" got old pretty quick. The moral of the movie, which there is in every movie, was deep, yet had it been delivered in a different way, it would have been more convincing and, the lazy humor wouldn't have been so painful and disappointing, or wouldn't have SEEMED that way, had the producers ELABORATED upon that moral a little more.

The main weakness? The script could have been richer and, well, much funnier. In 'Derek Zoolander', Stiller creates a loveably dumb character, a top male model who is all beauty and no brains. But it works out as little more than a one-joke movie, and even that one joke (that models are dumb) is stretched too thin to be really funny. Mike Myers did the whole male vanity-cum-dumbness routine much more richly with Austin Powers. Having said all that, however, the movie is almost worth watching for the plot device in the climax alone. OK, so it's Stiller, and thus watchable, but with all that talent there (I mean, even Stiller's dad is played by Jon Voight), it could have been much better. Owen Wilson is good, though, as the blonde supermodel Hansel, and the movie is an amiable way to pass an evening. But it isn't Stiller's best work.",Zoolander
390,Jeremazing,Amazing,9,8 August 2007,"This movie is one of the best. Such simple and hilarious writing is amazing in this movie. Ben Stiller is the smartest actor around. He might not be the most serious, but when it comes to acting he knows exactly what to do. With support from Owen Wilson, this movie is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Anyone who doesn't like this movie hasn't really seen it. Male modeling isn't something anyone ever thinks about. I think it is amazing how they portray the male models in this movie. With gasoline fights and fighting over what hair gel to wear this movie tops them all. If you can remember anything from this movie remember this: ""Merman Pop, MER-MAN!"". Will Ferrel is also so great in this movie. ""Relax Don't Do It."". That song gets stuck in my head and I don't even know the words. If you are in a very silly mood and you want to laugh at something stupid, don't watch Borat or Jackass, watch the classic De-Rek Zoo-Lan-Derrr...Zoolander!",Zoolander

(Even though it isn't a comedy) This is one terribly awful flic that I would never recommend. I really don't care about mindless plots, but this one went a little over the lines. I couldn't even smile once during the movie.This is one movie that I would never recommend. Avoid at all costs. Don't even 'rent the DVD'. It's just not worth it.",Zoolander

The underlying slams to the industry are done so well that they take my breath away with laughter!! Ben Stiller is amazing. I think he's the best male comedian out there. Everyone in this film was really good. It's visually pleasing and the pacing is perfect. If you like to go on adventures and love to be entertained by out and out slamming humor, see this film!!",Zoolander

I quote it whenever possible, own 3 copies of the movie (so i can lend some out of course), and have gotten all of my friends hooked on Zoo.  This film belongs to Will Ferrell and Owen Wilson.  Ben Stiller is great as well, but without these 2 actors this film would not be nearly as funny as it is.  When people don't like this movie, i take personal offense.  It's comic genius!  Ben, Owen, Will, and the rest of the gang deserve medals for brightening up my life!  I LOVE THIS MOVIE. IF YOU'RE CONTEMPLATING SEEING IT...STOP!  JUST GO AND SEE IT!  if you live on Long Island i'll even lend you a copy :)",Zoolander
402,mosmib,Hilarious one-liners!,9,16 May 2003,"Zoolander is an absurd movie and for that reason alone I recommend it. The one-liners in the film are the best.    Mugatu (Will Ferrell's character) is one to keep an eye on throughout the film.  Everything he says will make you say ""What?""  Do yourself a favor, if you want to laugh check out this movie.",Zoolander

404,Dr_Proctor,Dire,2,20 July 2004,"This film had some promise, owing to the original premise of its plot. However, Ben has decided to ditch the idea of having a straight spoof of the fashion industry and fill the movie with 'off the wall' nonsense. Also, unfortunately Ben Stiller has decided to put himself in it which ultimately dooms any hope of greatness. He has also chosen to lace it with a banal script, tedious characters, and droning soulless techno music. I wont bother explaining the wacky plot, as it only - temporarily -distracts us from how badly produced the rest of the movie is. Basically though, Ben Stiller(Derek) is an Adam Sandler type character, but he fails to emulate even above the direness of 'Going Overboard', which is the worst movie I have ever seen next to this. Co-star Owen Wilson(Hansel), a rival model continues his trade mark one-dimension characters in this bout of shoddiness. Also, how could someone(Wilson) with a fractured nose get the position for a male model? Ben Stiller has to go back to Kindergarten and learn how to act, and develop funniness, although I am a little pessimistic about his chances.",Zoolander

I highly recommend it.",Zoolander
406,aaronjmurphy,Beyond the Comedy,10,28 November 2011,"It is undeniable that Zoolander (2001) was meant to act as a comedy and to portray numerous satirical views on life, however, there may be an underlying meaning hidden behind all of the foolishness. The director, writer, and star of the film, Ben Stiller, may have intended to teach everyone a lesson through the humor that he created. Although the reason that most people enjoy this film is simply because of its tendency to keep you laughing, there may in fact be a message being communicated. By taking a humanistic approach to the evaluation of this movie, we can find the statement that it is trying to make about society.The protagonist, Derek Zoolander, is a male-model and throughout the entire movie, there are satirical moments where his stupidity is made evident. Some may believe that Zoolander only speaks towards the actions of models, however, it is directed to all of those who let society tell them what they can and cannot do. Initially, Ben Stiller portrayed Derek as a hopeless person that merely followed conformity rather than actually using his own brain. A fashion designer named Jacobim Mugatu, realized that he could easily brainwash Derek into murdering the Prime Minister of Malaysia. This part of the movie clearly exposes the fact that he can be pushed around and told what to do, however, as the film nears its end, Derek becomes his own person. He becomes conscious of the fact that he has been brainwashed and he ultimately saves the Malaysian Prime Minister from his death.In creating this movie, Ben Stiller was trying to make a statement. He was trying to show that everyone should use their own mind, and should not try to live off of anybody else's; especially since Derek essentially performed a great deed after gaining his independence. By evaluating the film, a critic would notice that beyond the hilarity, there is a great moral significance which communicates a better understanding of life. Zoolander simply proves that anyone can make an impact on the world if they would legitimately use their head.",Zoolander
407,pslaz1,"Not brilliant, but very funny and stuff.",7,1 April 2004,"I can't say I finished watching this film thinking it was brilliant. My first reaction was that it was both funnier and more intelligent that I expected, but that's not giving it a huge amount of credit in either regard. Actually it was quite a bit funnier than I expected, with many moments that I couldn't help laugh out loud. Still, it does bring out many of the cliches in getting a laugh out of the audience, and while some of these were done very well it wasn't so consistently brilliant that I would want to watch it again and again.Slightly better than disposable this fun and funny movie was better than your average Hollywood comedy, much better, but it still left me feeling for a lack of depth that no great lines can redeem. 7 out of ten.",Zoolander
408,sanaaamar23,Greatest comedy ever,10,12 July 2004,"This movie is so funny. But it's not just stupid physical comedy. It's the smartest jokes ever. Eventually those of you slow people are not gonna get them all. Anybody doesn't think this movie is funny well well there isn't much to say to you. God bless you. That means you aren't very sharp person after all...I mean just listening to the accent, Ben Stiller developed for this movie is worth the admission.Jokes will come so fast and they are so stupid. So stupid is the hardest to create kind of humors. Because very very often ""supposed to be too stupid"" jokes become ""stupid jokes"" And we've seen that too many times.",Zoolander

However thirty minutes or so into the movie I contemplated actually leaving the theater. After the movie was done I contemplated pleading with the front counter for a refund. I sat through this movie hoping that eventually I would see the final credits and the hour and a half of suffering would be over...or maybe there would be some sort of character development or plot besides that of ""Zoolander"" trying to hone his modeling skills to outdo ""Hansel"" but it never happened...it went from bad to worse! I never would have expected to go to a Ben Stiller comedy and not laugh once...I would like to apologize to anyone who like me paid money to see this movie. Anyone who has been contemplating it...don't even rent it. Wait ten years when it is on Comedy Central and watch it then. It isn't worth the money or frankly the time it is an hour and a half of your life you will never get back!!!",Zoolander
410,pierre_brown17,"fantastically articulate, wonderfully conceived.",10,30 August 2004,"This film is quite simply the finest comedy to come out of the US this century. That's why it flopped there. Tut tut. Stiller and Wilson do the original buddy stuff, playing out their ridiculous male models to perfection, whilst the supporting cast are sensational. Jon Voight as Derek's New Jersey coal mining father (you're dead to me boy, more dead to me than your dead mother), Will Ferrel's bizarre but hilarious fashion designer Jacobin Mugatu, creator of the piano key neck tie (obey my dog!) and Jerry Stiller's track-suited, dwarfish agent lothario with serious renal problems (ah, my prostate's flared up like a honeydew) all combine to make a film with barely a laugh-free second. Oh, and David Bowie's in it. I think, in all fairness, it's a case of either getting it or not. Personally, I find a poodle in a wig, pointless celebrity cameos and the phrase orange-mocha-frappucino pant-wettingly funny. If you don't then please leave now and go watch Starsky and Hutch like all the other cool kids. But know this: you are a big fat faker. Put a cork in it Zane!",Zoolander

This is one of those movies that i can just watch over and over again without getting tired of it. I think one of the big highlights in this movie is the Characters and their stories, it really was a great job! If you like comedies and stupid humor this is a movie for you! One of a kind, See it!

This movie has many good memories to recall and when I watch it I think of all the good times my family and I had while watching it.I know that sounds dumb, but ohh well.This is one of my favorite movies.One of the parts that we find hilarious is when hansel and derek are doing the walk off, they make the same faces and everything.I think that owen Wilson and ben stiller work very well together.",Zoolander

If you like Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, and/or Will Ferrell; Dodgeball, Super Troopers, Austin Powers, Monty Python, The Royal Tenenbaums, Old School, or Napoleon Dynamite-then you should at least rent this movie.Personally, I love this movie. It is probably one of the funniest movies of all time. If you find the sheer stupidity of some people, this movie is for you. This movie is all about surprising you, the audience, with how incredibly stupid, vain, and far from reality these male models can be, and to back it up there are tons of cameo appearances by models and other celebrities.",Zoolander
414,jamesclayton333,The funniest movie I have ever watched.,10,5 November 2013,"Watched this many years ago when it first came out with some buddies. Never laughed so much and so hard, even more than at a really good comedy club with great comedians. It was painful to not be able to stop laughing, and the laughing was infectious and almost non stop. For months after my buddies and I would quote the movie to each other, strangers, and imitate the voices. Instant classic, and I have no idea how it could be rated this low, other than some people perhaps just didn't 'get it'.It isn't a serious movie to be taken seriously on any level, it is the silliest of silly comedies, but one of the best ones ever made in my opinion.

Some of you have obviously not payed enough attention to detail to some of the jokes. The main reason why i write is because this was the grandfather of brilliant funny films such as dodgeball, old school and so on which are all classics.The bit regarding the center for ants was priceless! so how dare you ppl not give this film a great review! How Dare You! So i conclude with advising the few people who disliked this film to watch it again and if you still don't get the humour then just pipe down and ""put a cork in it (Zane)""!!

Out of all the Stiller/Wilson collaborations this is definitely the funniest. There is so much going on in the film and I love the way all the celebs join in on the joke. Zoolander has a great soundtrack a very humorous plot and is light enough to enjoy whatever the mood.I would definitely recommend a few viewings before you make judgement. Will Ferrell is manic as Mugato and Wilsons Hansel is as laid back as all his all his characters. The scene in the coal mine is the best. Enjoy whilst partaking of an Orange Mocha Frappucino.

""Zoolander"" is a HOOT and one of my favorite Stiller's (of course, I have yet to see a Stiller that ISN'T a hoot).Derek Zoolander (Stiller) is the epitome of the stereotypical 80's male model  he's ""really really really good looking"" but just can't see past the end of his perfectly formed nose. Hansel (Wilson), like all the 90's up and coming male models, is known only by 1 name (because it is vain to have more than one name) and is so totally centered from navel gazing that his navel is ALL he can see. When the two worlds meet at the ""Male Model of the Year"" awards, Zoolander is left wondering if there is more to life than being ""really really really good looking"" and tells his manager he wants to start a ""school for kids who can't read.good"". The irony and satire are gorgeous, and so are Stiller and Wilson! How CAN it miss? Signed, Patiently Awaiting A New Stiller",Zoolander

We all enjoyed it and like to crack each other up with its hilarious one liners! It's basically the story of the fading career of a once super-hot model, Derek Zoolander. He is being knocked out of the modeling business by new, boyish Hansel (Owen Wilson). Derek is brainwashed to kill the prime minister of Malaysia. The story in between is the good part, however. Full of wittier humor than the very blunt lines of Dodgeball. Still stupid-funny enough for the shallowest of us to understand. I would definitely recommend this movie to teens and adults who want something that is easy to watch yet keeps you absorbed, and something that will take your mind off your own life for a while. Its humor will brighten your day a bit.",Zoolander
