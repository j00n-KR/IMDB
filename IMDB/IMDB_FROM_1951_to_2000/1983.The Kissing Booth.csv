0,SnoopyStyle,well that got melodramatic,5,9 August 2018,"In L.A., Elle Evans (Joey King) and Lee Flynn (Joel Courtney) have been best dancing friends since the day they were born at the same time to two best friends. Elle discovers that she has developed a crush on Lee's older hunky brother Noel (Jacob Elordi). The main problem is that Elle and Lee have set up these rules and dating the other's family is definitely one of them.I hope for nothing but good things for these adorable actors. This may not be one of those good things although it's not irredeemable. King is an adorable child actress trying to grow up on screen. Elordi is in full hunk mode. Courtney has limited character work in his role. Everybody is good. Even the mean girls are not complete ditches. This seems to be a simple cheery teen rom-com. There are a lot of referencing 80's and 90's especially the music. They're passing notes in class for heaven's sake. In the modern era, a kissing booth is impossible for a high school fundraiser. I don't think it would work for any fundraiser. This stuff hasn't been done since Revenge of the Nerds. Leaving that aside, their kiss makes no sense. He wouldn't be waiting around at the kissing booth. The plot is so simplistic that the movie refused to develop a love triangle. It threatens to try early on and quickly draws back. All of that is fine until it tries to be overly dramatic. There is no real drama to be had but the movie insists on injecting some big emotional conflicts. It could have done some smaller emotional arcs to maintain its poignancy. He's going to college and that's enough for emotional drama. As for Lee, the movie deliberately gives him a girlfriend before the reveal so that there is no chance for romance. The first half works somewhat as a light teen rom-com geared for girls. The second half struggles to make it dramatic when it doesn't need it.",The Kissing Booth
1,kosmasp,Teenage Girl Problems,4,9 October 2018,"You know I should have known, but then again I don't read anything about movies I am about to watch. And I try to watch as much as possible. In this case, this is most certainly aimed at a female audience and a very young one at that. So if that is true for you, ignore my rating and add some point to it (at least 2 maybe even 3 to 4).Having said all that, this is as cliche as it gets. It is convenient when it needs to be and far more complicated than it has any right to be, just to ""up the ante"", make it more dramatic. It tries to tell us it's not the usual cliche thing and sometimes throws in something edgy, but overall it is that romantic cliche movie you and you know where it is heading ...",The Kissing Booth
2,morrison-dylan-fan,The first Kissing Booth.,7,11 March 2019,"One of the most interesting developments which caught me by surprise of cinema in 2018 was all of the reports about the Rom-Com genre being fully revived. Taking part in an ICM poll for the best films of 2018,a family friend praised one of the Netflix Rom-Com flicks at around this time, which led to me stepping into the booth.View on the film:Directing for the first time since 2015's TV Movie Liar, Liar, Vampire, writer/director Vince Marcello & cinematographer Anastas N. Michos display an impressive ease over shaking the Rom-Com and YA Drama up together, via slick panning shots and criss-crossing sparkly montages dancing to Lee and ""Elle's"" friendship smoothly sitting side by side with circling panning shots and a Teen Drama soundtrack for the blossoming romance between Elle and Noah (who the makers don't try to hide is a foot taller than her.)Taking Beth Reekles's YA novel out of the booth, Marcello keeps the heightened romance that the genre is known for intact, but pins it down with a Rom-Com playfulness, from the initial dancing bond which leads to friends Elle and Lee making a list of rules to follow in life, to Noah and Elle having to find sly ways to hide their romance. Sharing almost every scene together, Joey King, Joel Courtney and Jacob Elordi each give bubbly turns as Elle, Lee and Noah Flynn, with King bringing out Elle's tenderness for the brothers, who Courtney and Elordi keep in a confrontational state,as the kissing booth opens.",The Kissing Booth
3,Hellmant,Way more of a cheesy kids' film than I was expecting!,4,18 May 2018,"'THE KISSING BOOTH': Two Stars (Out of Five)A teen romcom about a popular high school girl that's never been kissed, who ends up in a kissing booth with her secret crush. The film was written and directed by Vince Marcello, and it's based on the youth novel (of the same name) by Beth Reekles. It stars Joey King, Joel Courtney, Jacob Elordi, Meganne Young, Byron Langley and Molly Ringwald. The film was released by Netflix through it's streaming site. I found it to be really clichéd and forgettable. Elle Evans (King) and Lee Flynn (Courtney) have been best friends since childhood. Now Elle is a popular 16-year-old girl who's never had a boyfriend or ever been kissed. Lee is an unpopular nerd, but his older brother Noah (Elordi) is the most popular guy at their school. Elle secretly has feelings for Noah, but she knows it would break Noah's heart to do anything about it. Then Elle ends up in a kissing booth at school with Noah, and everything changes. The movie is a very kid friendly teen romance. It's definitely way more of a cheesy kids' film than I was expecting, and I never would have watched it if I had I known that prior to seeing it (I watched it because I've been watching almost every Netlix original film lately). So I definitely can't recommend it to most people, but if you're a teen girl (or a small child) you'll probably enjoy it. Everyone else should definitely avoid it.",The Kissing Booth
4,ops-52535,nice,8,11 May 2018,"Highschool movies are usually based on cheer leading,footballers and always angeled towards sex. that was my expectation when i flixed this on the net.
but i was very wrong. allthough there are sex, its a very varm and emotional story told in this netflix -piece.a long life friendship,with its secret rules are threatened from within.its a lot of fun,dancing to nice music,laughing,drinking,and not to forget , a lot of kissing.but also hate ,loss,crying and fear gives this movie a lot of sense and immersion
there are so much positive in here that should be reviewed,but that would spoil the fun,so take a view yourself.
this was a nice surprise for an old man, will i recommend this to my wife? definately.",The Kissing Booth
5,pennyelenabooks,Not Good Enough,1,27 September 2018,"For a teenager's rom com, the kissing booth is just okay. But it just felt like a tv movie that was rushly made.

12,masonfisk,HEED YOUR INSPIRATIONS...!,4,25 June 2019,"A recent Netflix teen dramedy starring Joey King wants to be the next coming of John Hughes but falls miserably short of that goal. Losing her mother at a young age, our lead has befriended a boy from a neighboring family but has the hots for his more jock, big man on campus brother who's known as quite the Lothario. When a school carnival approaches, the besties concoct a ruse to stage a blindfolded kissing booth (hence the title) in order to get her crush to participate & also win over the mean girls she wants to sidle up to. The expected happens & King makes out w/the man of her dreams which leads them to conduct a clandestine romance (keeping his brother & everyone else in the dark) before the secret comes out on the eve of prom. Never really buying into this film's conceit (her best friend already has a girlfriend & he never professes his love for her so his disapproval lacks motive) which wants to have it both ways where it wants to be a Disneyified romcom but the frequent F bombs (especially in the movie's last third) & King's predilection to appear in varying states of undress derails any good karma this film projects as having. Even having Hughes' main muse Molly Ringwald (playing the brothers' mother) is not enough to make this swill digestible. King is an undeniable talent but her predilection for picking bad material (Slender Man/Wish Upon anyone?) might catch up to her (the sequel to this film is coming out next year).",The Kissing Booth
13,AnnaPagrati,There's always a but...,7,29 September 2018,"Great movie, truly, and the lead actors really click together. Like, it's obvious they're a couple in real life...but...I think that the fact that everything that happened between Elle and Noah happened overnight is a bit, how can I put it, too much?The first kiss, the second kiss, the sex part and everything, it was just because of a kiss in the kissing booth. But nevertheless, I really loved the chemistry between them, and between Elle and Lee, I really think this whole concept was great.",The Kissing Booth
14,nancyldraper,A fail for me,2,12 December 2018,I just can't buy this as coming of age romance. It's more like a frantic race over a cliff. I miss the innocence of falling in love for the first time. The tentative progression of intimacy paced with maturity is now replaced by a mad rush past childhood before it's time. The appearance of romance without the maturity of intimacy. RANT ALERT: I'm so over shows about entitled rich kids with no boundaries or limits. I'm really tired of Hollywood norms setting the lowest possible moral bar for the rest of the teen world. Boredom laced with license! RANT COMPLETED. For all the above reasons this movie failed for me (and I know people will vehemently disagree with me - that is the right of free speech). My personal rating for this movie was a 2 (vacuous) out of 10. {Entitled Teen Artifice},The Kissing Booth

16,bettycjung,Teenage angst at its cutest,7,27 May 2018,"5/24/18. Amazingly I really enjoyed this teen rom-com, more than I expected to. This movie raises the question of, can you fall in love with a sibling of your best friend? Elle and Lee have been friends since they were in diapers. Then when the hormones kick in Elle falls for Lee's older brother, Noah, the player. After this, the movie keeps you guessing if it will ever work out for Elle and Noah, and can Elle and Lee's friendship survive this betrayal of their childhood pledge to never date a relative. And, all while in situations only teens can suffer angst over. Great movie to watch.",The Kissing Booth
17,eminkl,Just a awful typical teen movie,3,26 October 2019,"Acting in this movie isn't terrible, but everything else is just awful, the only decent thing about it. Every character is so bland and unlike any other character. Noah is nothing more than a bullying brute, and lee is just sad and dull, the main character goes back to her best friends. There's no bad chemistry between the two leads either, but the story is so bad that you can't just fall for it.

18,brookenichole-98054,Entertaining,5,23 July 2020,"The only thing I can give for this movie is how entertaining it was. The story was interesting and the characters were alright. The love story, however, was pretty bad. Noah was a terrible main love interest for Elle. The way he tried to control her and many other things that just sent red flags that she ultimately ignored. The relationship between Lee and Elle was nice. They weren't too bad except for their insane amount of rules they wrote when they were six.
Overall, it's not bad.",The Kissing Booth

This film is the most fake contrived 50 year old businessman written film I've seen since Bratz and at least Bratz wasn't insulting. I can honestly label this as one of the worst coming of age story films I have ever seen and ever will see.
It scares me to think ""sexual harassment"" could be glossed over so easily in this film. It scares me that people might think thats okay, even worse then the bad messages in Cyberbully.

The acting and chemistry was extremely believable. I loved Elle's extremely akward character and her relationship with Lee and Noah Flynn. Sure, at sometimes it was predictable and a bit cringy but I feel like that's part of what made the film so lovable. However I would have like to see her relationship with her family a bit more. I feel like that wasn't covered as well as other areas of the film because we had about 2 scenes with her dad, who's character I didn't really understand. But apart from that the film was an amazing awkward, romantic-comedy. Although, it did have a wonderful message at the end about individuality which I loved.",The Kissing Booth

It's about some best friends (man and woman) who make a list of agreements for the good coexistence but she falls in love with her friend's brother and breaks one of the rules of the list, unleashing the typical dramas.
Do you remember ""The no kiss list"" and ""my life at 17""? Movies that handle this same story of rules and fall in love with the brother of the best friend, in a better way.
A movie with all the teenage stereotypes.
Too sexualized, they use the Netflix formula to strip naked for no apparent reason.
With macho touches and a certain degree of sexual harassment.
The problem with being overly sexualized is that it is aimed at teenagers and can lead to misconceptions of what love is if it is not located on those topics.

The actors gelled and all had really good chemistry. While it was extremely predictable, the plot was good enough to keep my interest and it kept me wanting to see more. Some of the writing could have been better, but I think Netflix got this one right. I can't say that for some of the other movies they have put out.There are some parts that could be judged badly in terms of the ""me to"" movement, but these didn't make me not want to continue watching it or rubbish it afterwards.

33,LukeCustomer2,Scary,2,8 October 2018,"It is odd that Netflix seems so unable to produce movies for kids that are so toxic. This is another in a series of movies for teens that send the wrong message. Elle and Lee have been best friends since birth. Same with their moms. Elle's mom has passed away when the movie starts. Lee has an older brother Noah who is the popular jock Elle and Noah are attracted to each other. Sound good right? Nope. Noah is manipulative and creepy. Noah sleeps with anything in a skirt and is very controlling with Elle and he is even violent but not with Elle. The movie seems to think this is perfectly ok, but, it isn't. Lee is even more bizarre, though he apparently is heterosexual he doesn't want Elle, which makes no sense because Elle is attractive and his BFF. But he loses his mind at the idea that she would be with Noah. I mean really violent reaction. I could see him being annoyed by that but not the crazy reaction that he has.

35,Jared_Andrews,Littered with Cliches and Teenage Delusion,2,19 May 2018,"As I watched, I kept thinking that this movie had a very limited target audience. High school kids would likely relate to this, especially high school girls. Anyone older than that, would see the absurdity of everything going on and ask, ""WTF?"" 
 
 The Kissing Booth is the story of two high school best friends, Lee and Shelly (Joel Courtney and Joey King). They love to dance, according to the opening narration. This comes up later in the movie in a way that's supposed to be significant and touching, but it's actually lame and eyeroll-worthy.  The pals share an agreed upon list of friendship rules that come up sporadically throughout the story. Most of them are silly, the sort of rules you would expect from kids who are six, not 16. Rule number one is ""you tell each other your birthday wishes."" Really, that's rule number one? That's the first and most important rule of friendship? That's the level of ridiculousness this movie purports.  One day, Shelly and Lee need to create a fundraiser for a school club and decide to set up a kissing booth. All the girls want to kiss Lee's hunky older brother Noah (Jacob Elordi), all the girls including Shelly, who has developed a crush. As luck would have it, Noah also has feelings for Shelly, so he finagles his way into sharing a lip lock with her at the kissing booth. Their feelings for each other become clear, but, oh no, the friends have a rule against dating each other's family! Shelly and Noah must hook up in secret. Cue the predictable montages of the two lovebirds as they narrowly avoid getting caught by Lee and many others. It's hard to watch. Not only is it a painfully obvious and cliché storytelling tactic, it feels icky watching high school kids hook up over and over again. These aren't even the only moments that feel exploitative. Many scenes sexually exploit Shelly, as crowds of guys ogle her and cheer her on as she strips in the boys locker room and again later while drunk at a party. Like I said, icky. For some reason, there always seems to be a crowd cheering, oohing and awing at nearly every moment, which is clearly ridiculous. It's the sort of thing that only makes sense in a high school kid's fantasy. They're so self-conscious, even narcissistic, that they constantly feel that their every move is on display for the world. In this movie, that is depicted literally.Not so coincidentally, the movie is based on a book that was written by a girl at age 15. That explains so much. Now I understand why the movie suggests that kissing is the most important thing in the world. It implies that the kissing booth changed all their lives forever, which, again, is the sort of thing that only makes sense in a high school kid's fantasy. Of course, learning that the story was written by a 15-year-old, does not excuse all its flaws. The movie is still mostly awful, littered with plot holes and logical blunders. This movie could be perfect for a high school date night, but that's about it. It's not a good movie. I would advise anyone over the age of 18 to give this a hard pass.",The Kissing Booth

The characters just don't talk like real people. The things they say are so stupid but not even in a humorous way just in a way that confuses you. Like words like Lady Bump being used in a serious context. It is so strange.The acting is hit or miss at best.I don't know if they did or not but to me it felt like Nickelodeon studios produced this film, it has that fort of vibe to it like in the vain of like Fun-Size or Fred the movie or something.It just dragged on so much too I thought I'd been watching it nearly an hour but unfortunately I'd only watched 21 minutes.When I was thinking of the rating I thought it was a 1 star but then I thought that was kinda harsh so I tried to think of redeeming qualities and guess what, I couldn't think of one.So I would say skip it, I'm am going to watch the sequel when it come out just out of morbid curiosity but I don't hold out much hope.",The Kissing Booth

He also ends up apologising to her way too much even though he is only looking out for her, and she never acknowledges when she is in the wrong. Like most women. It is okay as far as teen rom com type films go. It is nice that the writer made a nice story for people to enjoy. I liked it more than I thought, I just would have wanted her to acknowledge her mistakes too, and I also would have preferred a slightly different ending.

44,heyimmyx,Immy's review : Too cringy and shallow for me,2,14 May 2020,"I really didn't like this.
Firstly, their romance and the whole plot was just so shallow. I know it's supposed to be a teen romance so you can't expect much depth, but I just felt absolutely nothing for their relationship. It was boring, dull and devoid of any real feelings or love. It was just built on desire and possessiveness more than anything. I usually don't mind a cute light hearted teen romance, but the difference is that those movies are actually self aware.
Secondly, I found the lead guy extremely unlikeable, and just down right patronising and controlling. He told all the boys in school not to go near her or date her? What? The movie makes it sound 'cute', but he just comes across as possessive. Therefore, I wasn't exactly rooting for him. Also he delivers the most cringeworthy lines ever. Elle : 'You're crazy -' Noah : 'I'm crazy about you'. Um no.
Third, I think it just tried too hard to be this iconic and classic teen romance movie thus becoming very full of itself. It was not very self aware of its own flaws. It ended up being a diluted more annoying version of something like pretty in pink.
I appreciate that the movie tried to be an uplifting fun movie for teen girls, and the camera was alright, but it just missed the mark with being a good teen movie. It's extremely cheesy, shallow and full of itself with no likeable characters. Plus the cliches are strong in this one. Sorry but not for me.",The Kissing Booth

📜 Plot: Best of Buddies Elle and Lee share certain rules of friendship. Things turn upside when Elle breaks Rule 9 and falls for Lee's elder brother Noah.
.
.
👨‍⚖️ Review : The Kissing Booth is a sweet and cute romantic flick which is strictly outdated. You a see a girl falling in love with a guy and she hides the fact from her best friend and things go crazy. This seems and is very accurately a stereotypical premise which defines american rom-coms since ages. This has very little to offer but is pleasant to watch.Joey King is adorable throughout. She as Elle is brilliant portraying herself as a girl who has never dated till senior year at school, and is always in awe when she comes across her crush. She is full of emotions and her eyes are damn expressive. Meanwhile Jacob Elordi as Noah, is simply average as the tall handsome crush of Elle . Joel Courtney is strictly ok as Elle's Best friend.The Kissing Booth is titled Elle's life changes when she organises a fundraiser for charity named Kissing Booth. The Movie is a cute, sweet movie with loads of happy and emotional moments for audience to enjoy but lacks originality .

👍Goods :
Joey King is Adorable and she is the heart of this one.

50,indiedavid,Horrible,2,28 July 2020,One of the worst films I have ever seen. Definitely the most annoying characters in the history of cinema. The screenwriter should be forced to dispose of his computer.,The Kissing Booth
51,shannen-l-c,"Not perfect, but everything you could ask for in a rom-com",7,1 July 2018,"First things first, I understand why some may disapprove of 'The Kissing Booth'. It plays into some of the common tropes and stereotypes that feature in any other American chick flick or rom-com - average girl hits puberty, gets a smokin' body and is suddenly the girl that every guy wants and then she hits it off with the hot, popular jock that's known for being a player. It's unoriginal and we all know it, but any movie of this type is going to feature cliche's of that type and if you don't like it, these kind of movies aren't for you. I also agree with other reviewers that it may send the wrong message to a younger audience particularly in regards to the way that Elle's sexuality is treated with her constantly undressing or showing off her body to get attention. There are also some problems with the way Noah (the love interest of the main character, Elle) behaves towards her, particularly at the beginning. However, it's important to point out that originally this story was written by a 15 year old girl on Wattpad, so obviously that has a huge impact on these issues. However, personally, none of this bothers me as I think that there is so much more to this movie than meets the eye and in comparison to other movies in this genre, it's not very problematic at all. Also, a lot of the issues (particularly regarding Noah's behaviour towards Elle) are realistic (come on, how many guys are jealous and possessive of the girl they like? It doesn't make it right, but it happens a lot) and get explained and resolved as the movie progresses. Putting a different spin on it, I think it's good that the movie shows those aspects of being a teenager because it's a time in your life when everything is heightened and you make lots of mistakes and bad judgements, just like the characters in 'The Kissing Booth'. Therefore, it's relatable for young people and shows other teenagers that might be experiencing the same thing that they're not alone. The acting is great, particularly from Joey King (Elle) and Joel Courtney (Lee), but all of the cast deliver good performances. All of the characters have great chemistry and mesh together well, and in comparison to other movies of this type the acting was very strong. What I love most about this movie is that it portrays a complex, well-developed friendship between a boy and a girl that doesn't turn into a romance. Elle and Lee's friendship is endearing and very meaningful, and reminds me a lot of the relationship I had with my own male best friend. It shows the ups and downs of friendship, what it's like to be betrayed by your best friend and how difficult it can be to be torn between the love and loyalty you have for your best friend, and the person you love. Elle's dilemma between the Flynn brothers is understandable and she handles it like I think most of us would. The romance between Elle and Noah was actually pretty well-developed for a teen romance. Although there was clearly an attraction between them, it wasn't based SOLELY on that (as it very often is in movies of this kind). They'd known each other since they were kids and clearly had a friendship and a connection. You could see that there was genuine love between them and something that extended beyond a shallow summer romance. It made the romance feel believable and more importantly, it made me root for them and feel optimistic about their future together. On a more general note, 'The Kissing Booth' has everything you could wish for a rom-com (as stated in the title) - it's fun, sweet, funny, emotional and romantic. It's something you can watch to switch your brain off and get that feel-good vibe. The characters are likeable (again, this is uncommon for movies of this kind), Elle is a great main character and very easy to empathise with and the romance is well-developed as is the main friendship between Elle and Lee. It also deals with the kind of issues that most teenagers go through at some point in regards to friendship and love, but it does it in a way that's not overly cliched or unrealistic. Overall, I enjoyed 'The Kissing Booth' and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of rom-coms or chick flicks, because it's probably one of the best new ones I've seen in years.",The Kissing Booth
52,Spidenus816,A Hollow Waste of Time,1,27 November 2020,"Incredibly shallow, this film is unfunny, unromantic, and uninteresting. It's a very ""un-movie"" in many ways I guess.",The Kissing Booth
53,mmevanille-53097,Not bad for its genre,8,20 June 2018,"Teen romance movies have been done to death so its surprising when one is done with different idea's and not just a replica of Mean girls or 10 things. Acting in this is decent, characters are pretty believable. Not everyone is a perfect person and I think this movie may also be a warning for younger girls to be more careful in selecting their partners; although sometimes it cannot be helped.Pace is good, not rushed nor does it drag. Its cute and funny at times. It is overtly American in its high school culture, but that's no different than the majority of films like this. Missed points were-1 Familiar themes, although a slightly different story than its peers it still wasn't unique enough to make it a classic. -1 Depth of Character. Acting was ok, and it represented teenage emotions very well, however there was not enough depth to truly connect with the characters and establish empathy with them.Therefore 8/10",The Kissing Booth

56,janerosslj,Got through 30mins of it and turned it off,1,13 May 2018,"I love Joey king. The trailer looked interesting so I decided to give it a try. It reminded me of The DUFF, which I ended up loving. Anyway, long story short, my first problem is, why would the whole introduction to the film be about Lee and Elle, when a large majority of the film isn't about that? Also, Noah Flynn, Lee's brother in all honesty, acts like such a jerk in the whole movie, kissing other girls, and failing to take responsibility for his actions. Maybe that changes later on, but the first 30 mins had no WOW factor whatsoever. Let's just say, if I saw this in the movies, I would have walked out.",The Kissing Booth

Was confusing and teaching young girls that it's okay to go on a date with a guy who slapped your ass??? Maybe I'm in the minority, but that is not okay with me! But she still went on the date, which I'm still confused about. I gave up, Turned it off. But than noticed on how many people were raving about it. So again, tonight, I attempted another try. Another 5 minutes and still nothing. This movie is so confusing, dosent add up and is teaching young girls so many things that shouldn't be happening.

59,audrablum,"Cute, fun, teeny bopper rom-com (Parents check for sexual themes)",8,25 June 2018,"This week I watched Kissing Booth (2018). It is a comedy romance with the logline ""A high school student is forced to confront her secret crush at a kissing booth."" Browsing through Netflix films I found myself watching this angsty teenage romance movie. It was really cute and had the typical teeny bopper feel with fun music, snarky dialogue, and bright intro graphics. It was easy to get into and pretty fun to watch. Of course the plot is driven by teenage sexual tension and easily exploited plot holes, but what teeny bopper rom com isn't? The content was surprisingly risque for its intended audience and the sexual themes were pushed a little hard for younger audiences, however, the story was still kinda cute. The actors pulled off some decent performances. The editing felt mostly standard for a romcom with a little creativity sprinkled around here and there. The pacing felt appropriate in all the right places. This is also one of the few movies I have watched that incorporates the rare dissolve overlay edit. Overall, I wouldn't say that the movie is the next teeny bopper sensation, but if you're looking for something light hearted to kick up your feet to and enjoy some popcorn then this might just be your thing.",The Kissing Booth
60,foxtrotmarie,Love this movie,9,7 April 2019,"The mix between rom com, comedy, and drama is perfect. The plot and character development is great. Really highly suggest this movie.The only part I really couldn't stand is half of Lee's character. The over possessive thing he had going on with Elle was a big ick factor.",The Kissing Booth
61,TheProteanGirl,Here's the thing,6,7 June 2018,"I liked this movie. For starters they chose a really good looking lead for the Noah guy, and the girl is funny and cute. I liked that actress. However, there are some concerning things about this movie which I'll say below:Firstly, yes they have a great chemistry but has anyone stopped to think that she's 14 years old and he's going to college so he has to be around legal age (18-19 according to a quick search)? If this is so this movie is advocating statutory rape, which is something super super creepy to think of while watching. With Hollywood having its share of these cases and rape allegations recently (in general), you'd think they wouldn't give any leeway for a ""benefit of a doubt"" about age. Either way, whether i'm right or wrong about the age, it is creepy because he's much bigger than her. In comparison she looks like a child to him when they kiss and are on the bed together. I found this aspect detached me from their chemistry a lot and I was rather disturbed by that in the back of my mind. I hope I'm not the only one who thought this as it's not something to handle lightly.The other criticism I have is the idea of the movie in general. She has this platonic relationship with the guy she grew up with (who is her best friend). But he seems more right for her than his brother (the brother is flat out aggressive and controlling of her before they are even an item). The best friend is more caring and obviously gets affected by this a lot. Yet she treats him like rubbish in the whole of the movie. She lies to him, tells him what to do and in the end says ""you don't like it deal with it or don't be my friend"" (not like he's the only true friend who has her back all along even protecting her from these players). She uses him and I don't find they are what you call true best friends. She literally pits 2 brothers against each other, and gets in their way. It's a very slutty thing, like she expects him to be her friend all the while she gets the attractive brother (and its win-win for her because she gets anythign she wants apparently). This isn't teaching good lessons to young girls. You shouldn't treat people that way, ever.Other than that, if these things were different, I'd say it was a great film. I liked it overall. I think it would've been cool if she ended up with her best friend since he was better for her and cared more about her. But obviously the good looking one always wins in these chic flick type movies...",The Kissing Booth
62,richard-fieldhouse,"You are sixteen, going on seventeen",7,28 May 2018,"A high school girl falls for her best friend's older brother. This is a teen romcom and as such it works well. Joey King in the lead role carries the story along injecting the energy and emotion to make things as believable as they need to be. She seems to be tiny, especially next to her love interest, but actually that's mainly because Jacob Elordi who plays the part of Noah, the older brother, is 6'3"".Many reviewers here seem upset by the gap in age between the actors - so much so that I've looked them up and they are, in fact, 18 and 20. So, a year or two older than the characters they are playing. What you'd expect, I guess. Maybe people have been fooled by the height thing and perhaps that was a little bit of a casting mistake, but some boys of 18 are that tall. Others also seem worried that Noah is a little prone to getting into fights and rather overprotective of his little brother's friend even before she becomes his girlfriend. But no one gets seriously hurt nor is anyone persistently bullied. In a politically correct ideal world teenage girls would not fall for the tall muscly football players, but that's kind of like expecting water to flow uphill isn't it? Maybe this film is a little more realistic than that, despite, or perhaps because, it comes from a story originally written by a fifteen-year-old girl.Maybe we shouldn't judge too much and just enjoy the movie for what it is.",The Kissing Booth

64,jadediamond,Don't Get the Hate for this movie,8,28 July 2020,"I only learnt about this movie after hearing about the negative reviews about it and with a title like Kissing Booth, it was skip for me.I decided to watch it for myself and I enjoyed it and have seen it multiple times. I liked this movie about two best friends for life named Lee and Elle who were born on the same day, their moms were best friends, and they do everything together even created a list of rules for one another. Trouble occurs when Elle matures and develops a crush on Lee's hot older brother Noah, which is breaking a rule of not dating a sibling. After Elle's body mature from tenth grade to an eleventh grade body, she's forced to wear an extremely short skirt which draws the guys' attention at school and causes Noah to get in a fight to defend her honor and stop his little brother from getting beat up.Yes, this movie has cringeworthy moments because private moments are acted out in front of a crowd like an 80s teen romcom like the Molly Ringwald played in when she was teen who is in this movie playing Lee and Noah's mom and a voice of reason. I hated the prom scene for this reason. I also agree with none of the cast obviously are not teens in real life. One guy looks thirty playing a seventeen year old.Yet, the criticism is Noah is what I find annoying. He's an alpha male character who loves Elle like a little sister, fights to defend her honor by other guys disrespecting her when he starts to develop feelings for her. He criticized for being protective over the woman he loves in a post feminist world where feminists prefer men to be emasculated Beta males like Lee who is borderlined gay, into crossdressing, and getting beat up by bullies at school. Noah is considered toxic masculinity because he acts like a red-blooded male. He's even treated like he's a horrible human being every time he defends Elle's honor against another guy disrespecting her. Even when his brother insults her, Elle sides with his little brother over her. It's ironic Lee is only disliked when he's possessive of Elle because she is the one thing he had his brother did not.The main question in this movie is voiced by her father. What does Elle want? Because she's more concerned about preserving her friendship with Lee until it becomes borderline unrealistic and Noah becomes sidelined to the approval of his brother.But despite this movie flaws, it had its fun moments and was enjoyable to watch. This is a movie you're going to either like or hate. There is no inbetween. I like alpha males who love, protect, and defend the honor of their woman, so I love the way Noah cares about Elle even though she though she behaves like the defiant female who ignores his good advice and has to be constantly saved from herself. So if you enjoy watching an alpha protecting his love minus a few cringeworthy scenes of guys cross dressing and private moments being acted out in front of an audience with 80s pop ballad blasting in the background which is forever linked to a better and an iconic 80s movie. It's a decent, imperfect teen romcom.",The Kissing Booth
65,FandomFanatic21,She can tell her best friend anything....Except this one thing,8,12 July 2018,"The Kissing Booth, tells the story of Elle and her best friend Lee and follows them through their unbreakable friendship. They have a long list of rules to maintain their friendship until Elle winds up falling into one of the big no, no rules which is no falling in love or liking your best friends sibling. Which in this case is Lee's older brother Noah whom Elle has had a long time crush on. The Kissing Booth is a cute rom-com with a very nice premise and great acting from rising stars.

66,Sweetigal85,Nostalgic and Delightful with a twist ending,9,19 May 2018,"I am seeing a lot of bad reviews for this movie and I am glad I didn't listen to them. I don't get where all the hate is coming from, were you people never teenagers?? This movie really brought me back to the realm of high school and I honestly feel like anyone age 14 and up could thoroughly enjoy this movie.First off, it was flat out hysterical. I had to keep rewinding and stopping because I was laughing so hard. Joey King is a wonderful actress and I hope to see much more from her. Throughout the movie I found myself laughing and crying with her. I do not think this movie is strictly for girls despite what the title may elude, I think guys could definitely enjoy this too. The plot of the movie is definitely not what I expected from the trailer. It seemed pretty cut and dry that Lee and Elle are best friends from birth who are clearly going to end up together. Even when Elle got into it deep with Lee's brother Noah, I still thought that Elle and Lee were ultimately going to end up together. It seemed only a matter of time that Lee was going to confess his love for Elle by the end. But apparently this movie was going for legit ""platonic love"" between the two main characters and they definitely successfully accomplished that. And Elle and Noah's chemistry was so epic that I honestly did not want her to end up with Lee despite what the trailer seemed to suggest.It was clear that Lee's utter despair upon finding out that Elle and Noah were together behind his back was simply feelings of betrayal, not any true romantic love he felt for Elle himself. He clearly had always had a rocky relationship with his ""superior"" brother and any jealousy he felt was that Noah had taken something else from him, not that he actually wanted Elle romantically for himself. The chemistry between Elle and Noah was AMAZING, particularly their enchanting scene at The Kissing Booth. I know every girl wishes their first kiss had gone that way! And especially with someone that handsome! The guy who played Noah is immensely attractive and looks a lot older than he is in real life. He is also Australian and over six feet tall which made every scene with the 5 foot four Joey King all the more adorable.It seemed needless to me to have Elle's mother die in the beginning or at all, and that is one of the reasons this movie does not get a perfect 10 for me. I guess they were trying to suggest that she not having a mother around made her situation all the more difficult, but I don't think your mother has to be dead for your teenage years to be full of angst and confusion. So I wish they hadn't done that.Another reason this movie does not get a perfect 10 is because of the ambiguous ending. I feel like we went through enough turbulence to finally see Elle and Noah together, we didn't need to leave off feeling like they might not make it. The whole Harvard thing was just bizarre to me as Noah seemed to be an angry young man with no flare for his studies. Was he going on some kind of sports scholarship? Or was he secretly very smart? I found that whole plot to be very needless.I am personally going to pretend that the batman car scene was the ending we were all hoping for and that he does not leave her at the airport in the end wondering if their relationship will last. I choose to believe it does!!!Lee getting over his feelings of resentment for Noah and breaking the ""rules"" to allow his best friend to be happy was all the loose ends we needed tied up neatly in a beautiful bow!",The Kissing Booth

68,LBarlane24,Criminally underrated,9,27 May 2020,"The Kissing Booth is a Netflix original that stars Joey King, Jacob Elordi, and Joel Courtney and revolves around Elle and her BFF Lee who were born in the exact same room at the exact same time and have been inseparable ever since. But they soon hit a curb as Elle begins falling for Lee's older brother, Noah, after her encounter with him in the titular kissing booth. As according to Elle and Lee's friendship pact, dating Noah is strictly off-limits. This puts Elle in an incredibly awkward position as she must choose to maintain her friendship with Lee or have a romantic relationship with Noah.Let me start by saying that I in fact have a Wattpad account. And if it hadn't been for this movie, I doubt that that would be the case as of now. With that said, I of course owe all my thanks to said movie.Now with that out of the way, I will be completely honest and say that this may be this best Netflix teen movie I've ever seen. The adorable Joey King gives one of the best performances that I've seen from her. Not only that, she and Joel Courtney have incredible chemistry with one-another. Jacob Elordi was also good, nothing great.Now if I have one gripe with the film, it would involve a certain scene or two. One of the scenes is of course the short-skirt at school one. Not that it was bad or anything, it was kind of the payoff that rubbed me off the wrong way. Specifically speaking, there is a guy at the school who flat-out sexually harasses Elle in front of Lee. And as soon as the two of them (that being Elle and the guy who did it) are given detention, Elle came off as way too forgiving of the ordeal.It really baffles me that this just so happens to have the exact same rating as Swiped does on Rotten Tomatoes. Not only that, it flat-out aggravates me that many people have favored To All The Boys I Loved Before over this. Yeah, I did not like that movie then and I certainly do not like it now.Overall, The Kissing Booth is a criminally underrated teen-flick and I rate it a solid 9/10 for the third time in a row.",The Kissing Booth

71,markj-02556,TYPICAL ROMCOM,5,29 May 2018,"The Kissing Booth is about a girl, trying not to fall in love with her best friends older brother after an experience at a kissing booth.This film is written and directed by Vince Marcello (Zombie Prom). It stars Joey King (Independence Day: Resurgence), Joel Courtney (Super 8) and Jacob Elordi (Swinging Safari).The story, even though clichéd in some places is still surprisingly dramatic. The one thing that makes this film watchable for me, is Joey Kings performance as the main character Elle. Her performance is too good for this film. Even thogh I defiantly do not think it is a good film, it is defiantly made for a certain age range, and if you are aged about 12 - 18. I really recommend this film as some light and breezy entertainment that will keep you entertained. It is the typical romcom.
 
But, the direction is sloppy and inconsistent in what style it wants to be some time, a John Hughes like romcom or a dream like teenage fantasy romcom, it just can't decide. Elordis performance stands out as a rough point for the film as well. This is only his second credited performance in a feature film, so you can't really blame him for being a bit stilted. But he often is acting along side King, whos performance is fantastic, so it makes his performance stand out like a sore thumb. Also, I must talk about the cringe worthy ending. Generally every muscle in body was tightening up by the end of this film because of how clichéd and cringe worthy it was.if you are in the mood for a cheesy romcom watch this, it will keep you entertained, but be prepared for the cringe inducing ending.5/10",The Kissing Booth

This sexist, abysmal, and oh so dumb movie is about as fun as having your eyes gouged out with a rusty nail. I could actually feel my will to live slowly decreasing at every mind-numbing line that is borderline offensive in its laziness. Take, for example, a scene in which male lead Lee is driving the star Elle to school, and bumps into the curb. She complains about his driving, only for him to ask her why she doesn't just get her own driving license. ""Well, why would I need a driver's license when I have my own personal chauffeur?"" She replies. An he just says ""True, true."" Apparently, I need to point out how you would need a driver's license to not have to deal with Lee's clumsy driving as you literally just pointed out. It's moments like these that make me wonder if the writers even read over their script. It's the kind of error that can usually only be found in a fourth-grader's self-insert fan fiction. And it cost me around 20% of my brain cells. Yay.That was only a small sampling of the stupidity on display in The Kissing Booth. I almost never take notes during movie, but within the first few minutes I knew that I had to document all the horror on full display. You know how many pages were filled with criticisms of this movie? EIGHT. Eight full pages outlining all my concerns for the sanity of the writers, comments on the utter lack of care anyone involved in making this had, and questions that I know will never, ever be answered.The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is because this movie features a rare platonic relationship between a male and a female, which I did appreciate. But other than that, it's hard to call The Kissing Booth a movie, as much as a fiasco of epic proportions. Please, please, I beg of you, watch a better rom-com, such as Florence Foster Jenkins, The Devil Wears Prada, or really anything but this.Final Score: 18/100.",The Kissing Booth
74,seveneleven-44269,Will be a 7/10 if...,5,26 August 2018,"Not bad,I may have given it a 7/10,if they haven't fudged up in the last 20 minutes of the movie.",The Kissing Booth
75,ravs05,Not Bad ... Not Bad At All,6,12 June 2018,"Considering this is direct Netflix release, it is surprisingly a good film. The production values are decent and the writers did put some serious thought into the script. I was expecting another cheesy teen girl-coming-out-of-age flick, but this is one of the better ones along side flicks like Mean Girls, Love Rosie. And talking about coming out of age, little Ramona has grown up and she makes sure that the world sees her in this new light. She exposes her rear through ripped pants, wears the shortest skirt ever, strips to her underwear and gets drunk in the first 15 minutes of the film. She eventually ends up having sex, not sure what kind of message it gives young teens as she is still in high school. But yes, little Ramona tries hard to break away from that sweet, innocent childhood and we might have another Miley, Kylie or Ariel brewing here!Besides this, the film does give a decent view of high school, friendship and teenage romance. The whole friendship angle along with their rules is quite fun to watch. So yes, this is one Netflix production which you should not miss. It's fun, sensible (at times) and one of the good ones out there.",The Kissing Booth
76,rdtaxes-1,Same old story,5,24 July 2018,"This story has been done time after time. Forced acting. Horrible attempt to match Elle (Joey King) with Noah (Jacob Elordi). There is NO chemistry between these two. Totally unrealistic. Prom scene is almost a rip off of Pretty in Pink. Maybe with a different lead actress this would have been a much better movie. Nothing new here to watch, keep on moving.",The Kissing Booth
77,lydiajp,Loved it! Great teenage movie!,8,7 January 2020,"I have to say this is exactly what I like to watch in a teenage movie. Don't want to spoil the outcome so that is all I will say. I am nowhere near my teens and this movie made the teenage girl in me very happy. She wanted to give it a Ten even. Well for my standards an eight is high but I couldn't help myself. It was very captivating and the brothers were way hot! Anyway, it's a fun movie. I would watch a sequel in a minute.",The Kissing Booth
78,trenmast,"Designed to be a classic, fails miserably",3,11 June 2018,"This movie was carefully designed to become a teen classic like Clueless or Mean Girls. It's not... The casting doesn't really work. The guy is like 6'5"" and 28 years old. The girl is a midget and looks 13. The plot is just a huge cliché. You can't figure out if her best friend is gay or is in love with her. Doesn't really make any sense. The cool kids aren't cool enough, the nerds aren't nerd enough. The kissing booth scenes are cringe worth. Best thing in the movie is Joey King in underwear. She was a kid few years ago and now a very beautiful and hot young girl. Sorry Netflix, maybe next time.",The Kissing Booth
79,loueysmith,Love this!!,10,12 June 2018,"I've watched this movie several times and could honestly watch it a few more! I'm not usually drawn to teen movies, I find them all to be much alike and cliched...but this was fun, funny, sweet, romantic, innocent and real! Sure there's a few cheesy lines in it, but I think it'd be hard to do a romcom without them.
The chemistry between Elle and Noah is really felt throughout the whole movie and even before they actually kiss as well. Which is not always the case in these kinds of storylines and it does make the romance less believable and a little more boring. 
I love some of the funny moments in it like Lee knocking on Elle's door and asking what the moaning was, Elle's response to that was impressively random and funny, I literally burst out laughing at that scene! 
I've read some comments on how Noah is toward Elle in the lead up to their first kiss, how he's overprotective and it's sending the wrong message out...I disagree with this totally, his behavior was that of a guy who was obviously having feelings for Elle, but didn't know what to do about them, not wanting a girl he clearly liked to get treated poorly by guys he knows as players and a little of wishing he was with her himself. A mixture of all those things. 
I really enjoyed watching it and will definitely enjoy more of it to come.
Just hope they do a sequel!",The Kissing Booth

84,courtneypedersen,Romantic Comedy or Cautionary Tale?,3,12 January 2019,"I gave this movie three stars for the friendship between Elle and Lee and for that alone. It would have been a very cute coming of age movie if it weren't for the relationship between Elle and Noah. I knew the book this movie was based on was written by a teenage girl so I wasn't expecting something thought provoking. It started off promising too until it got to the scene where Elle is wearing a very short skirt and a guy decides to grope her. Noah comes crashing in, pummels the guy and then while Noah and Elle are waiting in the principals office he tells her, and I quote, a ""girl is asking for it"" when she decides to wear a skirt that short. That instantly made me dislike the character of Noah and it did not get better. Later on in the movie, after throwing a guy to the ground for hitting on Elle, Noah realizes Elle has run away and follows her. He's pleading with her to get in his car so he can drive her home and like a switch has been flipped, he forcefully slams his fist into the hood of the car and screams at her, ""Get in the car, Elle!"" For a moment, the character Elle had a frightened expression on her face and then she got in the car. That was where the movie lost me. The character Noah is borderline abusive with Elle, has a horrible temper, treats women like they're disposable razors and even Lee, Noah's own brother, accused Noah of giving Elle a cut on her cheek which she got from falling in their garage. If Noah's own brother thinks he could physically abuse a girl, that doesn't say much for that character! Is this what we're trying to teach girls? That a guy must love you if he wants to control you and scare you into submission?? The last time I saw subject matter like this in a movie was in Fear with Reese Witherspoon and Mark Wahlberg and that didn't end well! And truth be told, that is not something that should be romanticized.
I think this movie would have been much better either without Noah all together or if they had turned it into a cautionary tale about abusive boyfriends. Maybe I missed the whole point of Elle and Noah's relationship, but from what I saw, I can't say that I'm sorry I missed it.",The Kissing Booth
85,laurasomia,"An awful, completely tone deaf movie",2,12 September 2019,"How on earth was this movie so successful? I get that the main actors are all very attractive but can we talk about the plot ? What's the deal with all the violence ? This movie isn't doing anybody a favor by portraying a girl who drops everybody in her life, as well as her values, to be with the hot, older and violent guy!

91,luciabcn86,Enjoyable movie but something's off,7,26 July 2018,"I liked this film, but I agree with the other reviews which say that the storyline doesn't totally make sense. The main character seemed to completely rush into sleeping with a guy, when at the beginning of the movie she hadn't even kissed anyone. Also, the guy she falls for spent the first half of the movie being completely off with her and hitting on other girls, not even wanting her at his party etc. Then they miraculously fell in love because they kissed one time at a kissing booth. Also, during the first half of the movie, it seems like any excuse there is for her to take her clothes off she just takes, purely innocently of course, without thinking anything of it, and her love interest just happens to be there at each of these moments and suddenly shows an interest in a long term relationship with her. I just didn't buy into the sudden change in his attitude towards her or her decision to take things so quickly with him. But despite all of that, it is cute and in a warped way it probably is how young girls probably dream of romances progressing, I just don't think it's that realistic.",The Kissing Booth

Her: ""But your brother."" 
Brother: ""I hate you."" 
Her: ""Don't hate me.""

96,Bello-4,Don't Listen To The Naysayers... A Fun Little Movie...,8,22 October 2018,"Don't listen to the naysayers about this movie... First, they're probably SJW's in how they're perceiving negative messages towards young girls. Politics invades everything I guess... Seems no one can just sit down and be entertained??? I saw a young female lead that was well written and holding her own against the young male talent. A character who's written to be athletic, intelligent, not afraid to stand up for herself and not wearing things that would be inappropriate for a girl of her age or a movie of this type. I saw both young males with whom she associates with protect her modesty, treat her right and stand up for her against that stereotypical dog of a guy. Secondly, have they read the source material? This movie is based upon a book of the same name. The movie is probably just as ""lite hearted"" or ""cheesy"" or ""cringy"" as the source material. I mean it's for teens, it's not some Oscar caliber movie after all.I might've toned down the scene where Noah strikes a vehicle and yells at Elle and also chosen a college closer to home for Noah rather than test a budding relationship with him going to college on the East Coast (they live on the West Coast) so you could imagine they get together on the weekends and school breaks. Lee and Elle being both born at the same time to different parents who themselves are friends function was siblings. As the movie winds down I thought that the Lee character seemed rather clueless as Elle despite rules made in conjunction with Lee that run their friendship still can't help but fall for Lee's older brother Noah. I can understand that Lee feels as if yet again big brother Noah gets whatever he wants, including Elle, but playing up the Rachel character which Lee seems smitten with (and her with him) could've helped assayed any awkwardness or cluelessness...This is the type of movie that should be made more often, it doesn't preach, it's a good way to spend a couple of hours...",The Kissing Booth

98,ana57709,WHAT HAPPEND TO MOLLY RINGWALD??,4,24 May 2018,"Okay, the first thing I have to address here is that I have noticed Molly Ringwald has starred in some of the cringiest teen movies and shows of the last year or so and I can't help but wonder what the hell happened to her career that was SO bad that she has to stoop to this level. Had to get that out.How The Kissing Booth got a 6.5 rating is beyond me. I admit I stopped watching half way through because I just couldn't take the cringy dialogue anymore. I felt shame for the characters where they should have felt it, maybe then the plot would have looked like something kind off worth watching instead of crap. It's not absolutely horrendous, like, you could finish watching it if you are cringe-immune, but it's still pretty bad if you are into quality. The teenagers have no depth and superficial things keep happening that glorify clichés and stereotypical behavior which should not be acceptable for young girls in 2018 anymore. This being said I don't want to be one of those people who gets annoyed at everything. The Kissing Booth is watchable as what I like to call an on-the-side movie. Something you turn on while you're doing your nails or scrolling through your Instagram feed.

It's easy to root for the main character Elle (Joey King), she's likable, witty, fun and smart. But love doesn't always make us think things through & we don't always say and do the right things. Noah (her love interest m) has that good looking, football player, jock, not so smart feel. But they both discover that there's much more to each other than what appears. They struggle keeping their relationship a secret from mostly her best friend (Noah's Brother) and those around them. Through the movie Elle has trust issues with dating someone like Noah.

The teen actors are superb - very genuine, if such a thing can exist in acting as all of it is an imitation of real life in the movie and theatre world. It was fun to watch, there were emotions but not cheese ones, there was truth and there was fantastic kissing (I had butterflies in my stomach when characters were doing it). Most of the scenes depicting romantic days of the protagonists, their making up etc. were very close to real life. Such light-hearted authenticity with a streak of magic is more assigned to French movies and I was happy to see that it can be done in an American movie too. I also loved how LA city was depicted/shot in this movie - a melange of Coney Island meets Cote D'azure and the oceanic beach culture with thrill of sunshine and blue sky.

120,KCFAM,It had potential...,3,15 April 2019,"I wasn't sure what to rate this. It had potential... but a few major issues. First, it encourages unrealistic expectations. Is it normal to have a crush on the cute popular boy? Yes. Is that boy likely to date you? No. Sorry. I feel like this premise sets girls up for disappointment (I had the same problem with Sierra Burgess).
Secondly, condoning teen sex. Are a lot of teens having sex? Yes. Are ALL teens having sex? No. Especially not at 15. Showing Elle jumping into bed with the first boy that pays attention to her sends a bad message to teens. You don't have to sleep with someone just because he's more experienced or because you think he expects it.

There's definitely a lot of very cheesy moments and lot of predictability and a few creepy scenes, but over all I think the movie is fairly good. While it can be cheesy and predictable, overall it somehow feels fresh for the typical teen romcom/coming of age story it is. The script, while flawed, is interesting and well paced. I think both of the Flynn brothers are very controlling and possessive of Elle, but I think she portrays a strength and pushes back against them enough to show the right kind of message. Overall I was very impressed with the acting, the slight break from complete cliches, and the fun and light tone the movie had.

I would like to add to this list the fact that no where on this planet is there such a rule as ""you don't date your best friend's relatives"". This whole movie centers around Lee's ""drama"" that he can't stand seeing his best friend dating his brother. There is no logic to this behavior, apart from Lee really being a selfish psychopath. I can't believe this movie states this problem as if it is something normal that people actually do. Sure, let go the love of your life because otherwise your snowflake friend would be upset. Right. And make a drama out of it. And then be thankful when snowflake finally allows you to be with the one you love. Wow.",The Kissing Booth

They never mention him being smart until they dropped that BOMB on you.

139,emilyjmalbon,Cute on the surface but a bad message for young girls,1,28 May 2018,"I'm 28 and went into this movie knowing full well it's aimed at teenagers. I enjoy fluffy teen romance though so have no problem with cheesy storylines and characters, and this film is full of them! What I did have a problem with is the way relationships between women and men are portrayed in this film. It seems to start out ok: the leading teenage girl (Elle) has a male best friend (Lee) and their relationship is pretty cute and I thought it was quite progressive to show a girl and a boy who really are just friends without all the usual sexual tension you get in movies like this. Lee has an older brother (Noah) who is unremarkable except he is very good looking. Things then start to go a bit wrong. It turns out Noah is pretty controlling of Elle, even telling all the other boys at school they can't date her or he'll hurt them. He frequently gets into fights with other boys when he sees them talking to her and beats people up. In one scene he's shouting at Elle to get in his car and even slams his fists down on the car bonnet aggressively whilst telling her, which made me feel really uncomfortable. There's even one scene where Elle has a minor accident and cuts her face, and Lee asks her if Noah hit her! That scene is then never followed up by any explanation - why would Lee immediately assume Noah beat up Elle?!Meanwhile, Lee, who is portrayed as Elle's loveable and affable best friend controls her in his own way, by freaking out when he finds out she's dating Noah, asking her if she's having sex with him (none of his business?) and only accepting her back as a friend when she is no longer seeing Noah, despite her being obviously devastated about breaking up with him. In one scene he insists to her that breaking up with him was the right decision (he didn't really leave her any choice though did he).There are also a couple of weird scenes where Elle strips off to the delight of crowds of boys, once when she was so drunk she had no idea what she was doing and everyone just stood there and allowed her to take her dress off. Another time in the boys locker room. Both scenes were odd and again, made me feel uncomfortable. Other strange elements of the film are Noah being portrayed as a bad boy who gets into fights all the time, yet the reasons for this are not even explored one tiny bit. And even weirder, despite him being a bad boy who is presumably troubled, it's revealed that he's really randomly got a place at Harvard. This was weird because at no point during the film was it suggested that he was academic or even remotely ambitious, yet you don't get into Harvard without trying! There's also a summer montage of Elle and Noah together which is basically them having sex anywhere and everywhere. It felt a little yucky because she's a high school teenager and I thought it was an irresponsible message to send teenage girls out there. A really funny part is when the kissing booth is immortalised at their prom as a memory that touched everybody's lives and Elle's all emotional because she was ""part of something"". REALLY? A kissing booth?! Then, after sitting through all of this, Noah goes off to Harvard at the end of the movie and you're very much left with the impression that's the end of their romance. So I didn't even get the feel-good happy ending I was after. So basically, this movie is really awful and if you have a daughter, I'd actually advise extreme caution allowing young girls to watch this movie because it really does send out the wrong messages about relationships and sex.",The Kissing Booth

On a shorter note, it's just your typical run of the mill high school ""comedy"" with an original story and a forced relationship between two high schoolers who don't have any real reason to be together beside their mutual attractiveness. I mean the guy literally is known for beating people up... he wasn't a romantic or likable character.

I had seen Joel Courtney in Super 8 as a kid and I found him a very promising actor, but in the Kissing Booth his acting looks forced and is not believable at all. The same is the case for Joey King and Jacob Elordi. Some of the scenes were really cringy because of their mediocre acting.The story is a typical teenage romance about a girl who falls in love with her best friend's brother: a huge cliché. Elle is the kind of girl whose world spins around one guy and it's just annoying to watch. The characters are extremely shallow. The romance between Elle and Noah is really unrealistic. They have nothing in common, but they just like each other's looks, they fall in love with each other after one Kiss and the list goes on.Anyway, you get my point. The Kissing Booth is another crappy high school drama were nobody was waiting for. There is really nothing positieve to say about this movie.",The Kissing Booth

157,Riles123,Cringe-worthy and Misguiding,4,15 June 2018,"I will have to agree with the users who are perturbed by the blatant lack of respect had by nearly every male figure in this movie for the main character, Elle. I will also have to disagree with those that claim the lightheartedness of this movie, or its ""fictitious"" nature as another put it, excuses the terrible messages it sends to its young audience. Elle only gets attention once she starts showing her body off, the young men constantly refer to her body--especially her breasts--when speaking about her (really? Not one boy in the film is interested in her mind, in getting to know her, beside the Flynn brothers? Not only does this film give young women the wrong message about how to be treated, it paints the men out to be utterly devoid of a value system...), and worse yet, Elle is too daft to stick up for herself for the majority of the film! I know this character is young, but I'd like to think most teenage girls in this day and age instinctually get a negative feeling (trauma aside) when treated like a commodity. She just goes along with it, incapable of seeing in light of her desire to be liked how she's just being played. I'd like to see a character that not only sticks up for herself around her best friend's older brother, but who knows how to be treated! Now that's a role model. And once again, the poor value system impressed upon the masses by Hollywood is not to be taken lightly. Young kids are watching more and more TV; if we're not going to rectify their connection to the television screen, we might as well feed them information that compels them to grow. All in all I was very disappointed with basically the entire plot--and while the acting was decent for the most part, I too (like another reviewer) kept face-palming!

I feel like they should've actually developed the relationship more instead of showing cheesy montages. It felt like they dated for five seconds before they were in love. Also, I'd just like to say that the notion that Noah could get into Harvard is downwright absured and just plain laughable. Harvard is extremely selective and don't just look at your grades, they look at everything. In the movie he is constantly getting into fights and he skips school. There is no freaking way he could have ever gotten into Harvard. I just couldn't get past how ridiculous that was, I know it was in the book, but it's just plain stupid.

Elle and Flynn try to stay under the radar because she doesn't want to upset or hurt her bestie Lee.

It gives young girls, who will watch this, the wrong message about how boys should be treating them. He is known on campus to get into fights with classmates, also warns guys off of Elle and tells her what to do. They are trying to give him the ""big brother"" vibe, but it comes off more like possessive and controlling. There is a scene where Elle insists that if they do start dating that she has rules Flynn must follow. No more fighting, no more telling her what she can do, and that they need to keep their relationship a secret-at least until she can figure out a way to tell his younger brother, Lee...

179,cameronsfx,Adorable and awkward romantic comedy about teen love and friendship,10,6 January 2019,"The main three actors have amazing chemistry. Joey King is absolutely adorable as Elle in every way and so is her friendship with Lee (Joel Courtney). They have these cute little rules they are not supposed to break. Rule 9 is not to date Lee's bad boy brother Noah (Jacob Elordi). Their rules are pretty cute. Lee is out to protect Elle, especially from his bad boy brother. But, girls like bad boys.Elle, who has never been kissed, really wants bad boy Noah to kiss her so she sets up a Kissing Booth at school, and he kisses her. Sparks fly between them and soon they are secretly dating. This is not a spoiler since this is the plot of the whole film. Is the love of a friend stronger than the love of a lover? Which do you ultimately choose? What are you willing to risk for love?I figured the movie would be simple, but it is rather complex emotionally and paints a rather good picture of romance between Elle and Noah, and a great friendship between Elle and Lee. But, can her breaking Rule 9 destroy that friendship?It definitely made me a fan of Joey King. The movie is really all about her and her choices in life, and she delivers a strong performance (and she's totally adorable). You find yourself torn over her choice to date Noah and all that ensues. She's a rather complicated character and has a lot of depth. So does Lee. Noah's character surprises with quite a bit of depth, as well.The only unbelievable part? How Elle and Lee didn't become more than just best friends. Many times I was like, the heck with Noah, date Lee. The best guy for you is right in front of you.The ending really left open a sequel many say, but, it really is more like European films that leave what happens next up to the viewer.It's cute film.",The Kissing Booth

181,jamesferguson-04874,"Don't listen to the astroturfers, this is hot garbage that seems like a 14 year old boy made it",4,20 July 2019,"Look there's probably a perfectly adequate, if stereotyped, teen romance in here. Something I'd happily watch. Some of the people making the movie may even have filmed all the pieces for that movie. There are even elements that are pretty unusual and refreshing in here: the female lead is adorkable but not sexless, it's almost always one or the other; they're two high schoolers, they have sex, but the movie isn't about that and there isn't a single conversation about virginity; there's a male/female bff friendship in a highschool movie (although the film never even addresses the idea of them going through puberty as best friends of opposite genders, which seems like a wasted opportunity and an elephant in the room the whole movie); the gimmick about the rules of their friendship is a reasonable ploy for this kind of movie.The biggest problem is the editing. I remember an actor in one (good) movie dishing on the antics that went on during production and apparently the producers were so unhappy with the serious period drama they got they tried to demand it be reshot or recut as a competely different movie, when the crew refused they got in the editing booth themselves - with no experience at editing - and reedited the whole film trying to turn it into an action movie or something. I'm guessing something similar happened here because the continuity is a joke. There's a whole subplot with her Dad being angry at her that multiple characters refer to, and an apology from her, but we never see her Dad ever be anything but quietly supportive. There are weird scenes like Lee's girlfriend following her out of the party and then just giving up that don't go anywhere but were left in.The tone is all over the place: it opens with a slapstick pants splitting scene (and all her clothes are at the drycleaners; seriously) like a Disney family holiday movie except it doesn't land and yet in another scene later in the movie someone she cares about is calling her a ""sl-t"" who ""f-ed X"". Those are both scenes that could work in a movie, but never in the same movie. This movie can't decide if it's a Disney family farce, a cutsie Amelie-style romance, straight-to-TV hallmark movie schmaltz, an 'American Pie' sex-and-cringe teen film, a family drama about sibling rivalry or a feelgood teen comedy. Maybe all those elements could've been used in the same movie if they were skillfully woven into a unified whole, but in this movie they came off as disjointed scenes from different movies, just weirdly played by the same set of actors.As for her Dad he was completely miscast. In fact while all the teens were either adorkable, gorgeous, or paper thin two dimensional high school stereotypes, weirdly all the adults (including Molly Ringwald) looked like grizzled, middle aged people who've been through a few things or at least were in a serious drama type movie.I'd complain about the many, many attrociously acted scenes, but for all I know there are scenes like that filmed for most movies, it's just that good editors choose the well acted takes but whatever producer's nephew edited this film slapped together scenes with takes that never should've seen the light of day. It didn't help the actors either that the script seemed only half finished, with a lot of lines sounding like placeholder copy that someone meant to come back and replace with something actually good.Oh, and keep an eye out for the just dumbfoundingly badly shot motorbiking-in-the-rain scene that looked like a parody of a bad movie it was so obviously fake.",The Kissing Booth

Also, the last half an hour had gaps left right and centre. All the emotions are flying high but nothing actually gets solved in any kind of proper way. She asks Noah to get lost when it's her fault it all blew apart? And then she recovers her BFF only by pretending she didn't have feelings which she clearly did - BFF suddenly gone blind? And I know the brother's have a strained relationship but so bad that the parents and nobody knows where he is and they only start talking after he's been gone for 3 weeks? ....

Everyone involved was either a horrible person or horrifically bland, except for the student council. The ""I'm British, you w@nker!"" line gets a chuckle outta me. But that is the only positive, it goes downhill from here. Strap in. Elle and Lee have a stupid list of rules that is one-sided and hardly fair, like no dating your friend's family members. Elle has a younger brother who's barely old enough to walk, and Lee has a popular, ""hot"" older brother called Noah. This film portrays Noah as a perfect man, when he is anything but. He is very controlling and verbally abusive, so it is jarring when Elle finds herself falling for him. At some point, Noah yells at Elle to get into the car and understandably frightens her. This is just one example of how controlling he is. He wants her full submission. This film and 50 Shades represent the bdsm community very poorly. 50 shades and The Kissing Booth both have abusive relationships, but at least the girl in fifty shades ends up leaving him. Yeah, I know, the sequels, but you get it. This film tries to say that only the love of a good woman can calm an angry man and just do away with his mental issues. That is not the message you want to portray to your young and impressionable audience. The characters are also repulsive. Elle is a pathological liar who takes pleasure in hiding her relationship from Lee, Lee is an obsessed, whiny brat; and Noah is a manipulative and controlling jerk. The OMG girls (Really? That's what you went with?) are just your stereotypical mean girls with nothing new to say. Saying it anyways, and making you wonder why you wasted your time.",The Kissing Booth

Oh, and they don't have any chemistry, which gives it even more Lolita vibes.
Other than that, cliché lines and cliché scenes, basically, all the unrealistic and unimaginative romance stuff you have already seen in a hundred other movies, delivered in a boring way. And all the alleged comedy consists in the girl repeatedly showing her underwear to the same bunch of guys. Because there wasn't enough of that in the world.

Watching this I noticed what a bad message the story has, especially for young girls. Some parts are so cringy I could only roll my eyes at the screen. Elle is incredibly naive for a 16/17 year-old, and is inconsequent most of the time. Firstly she flirts with a guy who harassed her when she wore an incredibly short miniskirt to school. That was not okay. Then she gets drunk because three or four drunk girls offered her shots; a few days later she shows herself off in the boys' bathroom just to prove a point to her 'crush'. More naivety follows throughout the movie. Also.. showing young girls they can have sex at 16 is an awful message, not to mention the somewhat abusive behavior of Noah. It's sickening. I also noticed an awful lot of misogynist innuendos throughout the movie and again, it's 2018. This should be not funny anymore. But anyway, at least I was glad the story didn't end up with Elle and Lee getting together - that's a good twist to the snappiness that The Kissing Booth was.

Teenagers need movies to relate to, and this is the movies target audience. I had this problem with 13 Reasons Why and To All The Boys I've Loved Before. All of these sources of media all have the same message: it's okay to be a weak, shallow, ignorant and low person. The Kissing Booth does this in a way that's not only insulting to the target audience, but also to the entire audience that spent 90 minutes watching this garbage. The movie all throughout has the main character narrating it. I know it's based on a book, but Jesus it's just unnecessary and falls flat in regard to comedy and trying to relate. Also, the main character is a selfish moron. I know teenagers make dumb decisions but she doesn't ever seem to learn anything throughout her experiences. That's the polar opposite of good story telling. A character is given a character ark and has to overcome it to become a compelling character. That doesn't happen with Joey King's character. She is a complete idiot and does not learn anything that benefits her well-being. She constantly talks about these rules in her friendship with her friend and she breaks nearly half of them. This could be a potential ark for her and her friend. But by the end, BOTH of them break the rules. So you don't feel satisfied with the ending at all. This is the black hole of bad teenage movies and I'm gonna give The Kissing Booth a 1/10. This is most certainly the worst Netflix Original I've seen in a while.

The dude is like 6'4 and the girl a good 5'3. Ugh that bothered me so much. To top it all off the movie was very mysgonistic and sexually exploitative. The girl Elle took off her clothes at least 100 times in the film to the pleasure of a crowd of googling teenage guys. She is encouraged by her best friend to go on a date with a guy who sexually assaulted her by slapping her on the butt. And her lover Noah isn't any better. He victim shames her by saying she asked to get assaulted when she wore such a short skirt. What?? He's also very manipulative and controlling and clearly has anger issues as he has to fight every single guy that gets ten feet within Elle. Not a good message for young girls at all! It was so icky.

A 10 is Inglorious Basterds - or any other movie that is made with finess, experience, beauty, great actors that understand their roles and a fantastic script.This movie contains nothing of such. I usually enjoy cheesy love stories. With that said, I love a love story that contains some kind of dept. It doesn't have to be Bridges of Madison County or The Notebook, but something more than the absolute blandness of a predictable teenage love story (and a teenage love story doesn't have to be bland, predictable or boring). With THAT said, love is quite predictable, but you can still make a cute, heartwarming teenage love story, even if it might be a predictable one.The chemistry between the leading actors is good, probably because they're a real life couple. That is the only positive thing I can say about this ridiculous movie. Looking beside the fact that I didn't enjoy the script, actors nor storyline, what bothered me the most with the movie is that it's extremely sexist. Example 1: a guy touches a girls ass just because she's wearing a short skirt, and she's just fine with that? I mean, seriously? What the hell are we teaching young boys and girls with that mentality, whom are the targeted group of audience for this movie? Example 2: the guy she loves more than anything, I mean.. come on. He's an (controlling) asshole. A good looking one perhaps, but still an asshole. And like any other movie: the hot guy is also quite stupid since guys can't be handsome and intelligent at the same time. Genius.I'm sorry for ranting. I shall stop now.

She was a pushover and an awful friend.
At the start of the movie we were filled in on the rules between Elle and her best friend Lee Flynn since forever, one of the rules was that's Elle can't go near Noah, Lee's older brother. Elle and Noah get into a serious and passionate relationship behind Lee's back. He soon found out and was furious and I felt like she expected him to forgive her like straight after but thank god he didn't because she needed to know that you never lie or go behind your best friends back.

231,jenniferannkoch,Great movie!,10,26 August 2018,"I never leave reviews. But felt I had to for this one due to all the negatively left here. I went into this movie with low expectations due to the review left. I actually blown away and enjoyed it very very much. I thought it was funny and pretty acurate of what I remember high school to be like in LA and how kids are. I thought the chemistry between Elle and Noah was off the charts!! I even rewound a few parts because I was like woah that was some amazing chemistry there! I don't think he was controlling at all to her. I think he was always looking out for her and wanting to protect her. The only part that made me take a step back was when he yelled at her to get in the car after holding back from really giving it to jay guy that insulted her on the beach. And I took that as he was holding it in and took it out on her for a second, he apologized very quickly for letting that happen too. Do we all forget what it's like to be upset and mad and to yell at someone?!

I think we are getting to caught up in ""political correctness"" that we can't enjoy anything anymore. It's a feel good romance film. I'm not a fan of chick flicks ect I'm more sci-fi and action kinda guy, however, this is the first romance film in a longtime that I want to watch over and over again. It has brilliant young actors that did a brilliant job. I think my favourite parts of this film are the ones where they are a lot like real life. I'm sick of film where at the end they tragically die or get there happy ending, sometimes it's good to leave you wanting more.",The Kissing Booth

1. That's how I need to act in order to get a guy
2. That's how a typical high school is for everyone (stereotypes and all)
3. Getting drunk and stripping has only good consequences
4. If a guy gets handsy, there will always be someone to save me
5. Sneaking around and lying about a relationship means that it's true love
6. Bad boy players who ride motorcycles make the perfect boyfriends
7. If I have sex with someone, we'll fall in love.It was a cute movie with okay acting and the main characters had good chemistry, but everything just conveniently kept falling into place and I felt like it was written by a 12 year old girl who fantasizes about what high school and dating is going to be like.",The Kissing Booth
234,girl_ranma,Guilty pleasure,7,27 May 2018,"I enjoyed the movie it was cliche however I did enjoy it. It was a bit quirky , cute and funny. There are a few concerns I had was the message this is sending to young girls. There is a scene where she goes to school and wears a skirt then a guy smacks her butt and then makes up for it in detention and the she goes on a date with him, uh... like what? What girl does this? . Then he stands her up and tells her why and she's so
Upset and goes on about how great her boobs are uh..? So like her personality isn't good enough but her boobs are? Just not a very good message or realistic one. I also wish the female character would of had more stronger traits then seeming like a girl who needs saving or the need of having someone watch over her. Like I feel like I saw her running away crying a lot. Part of me feels like there are some things missing like more about how Flynn developed feelings for El not because "" you don't crawl at my feet"". There's not enough substance or like why El has feelings for Flynn other than he is just good looking.",The Kissing Booth

Sit with your teen and make a game of it. Find all the references to 80s, 90s and 2000 teen movies and television shows. From Molly Ringwald to the Twilight series; it was a lot of fun.

Yes, Noah is a bit controlling to begin with BUT honestly he was defending her in most cases. I mean if some guy grabbed your crush/almost little sister's ass/pussy YOUD FIGHT A DUDE TOO. Or at least I hope you would. I feel like that is a message girls don't hear enough- it's always up to the girl to report sexual harassment- if other people see it they have a DUTY TO STOP IT TOO. Blissful ignorance is why it's taken this long to hear about Weinstein, Spacey, and everyone else involved in #metoo! For this point alone, I award the movie points- which I deduct for the principle giving the same punishment for dress code infractions and sexual assault. Like wtf?

239,alvesaricia,Hard to tell... Feel good and distracting but not much,4,21 July 2018,"I'm giving this title 4 stars because it does distract you, it's a great light romcom to watch on a sunday afternoon. Having said that, I agree with all the bad reviews I read here. It's a VERY cliché, teenage girls' fantasy (which is not something bad for itself, but it's a particularly bad fantasy for young girls to watch), it's exploitative of the main character, whose body is always showing up even though her personality is purposedly very childish. She acts, talks, behaves like a child and the movie does not hide it. She's also never even kissed anyone 'till halfway of the story. That much contradicts with all the sneak peeks and commentaries throughout the movie on how her body has changed and how much it appeals to the guys. Actually, my bad: it's no contradiction at all. Sighs.
We also have in this the good ol' naive-girl-falls-for-the-beautiful-but-problematic-guy-and-no-one-approves-them. It's even interesting to notice the casting choice. She's tiny and looks like 14,15 years old... He's noticeably TALL for her (to the point it stands out to you) and looks like early 20s. He's very controlling, keeps telling her what to do under the premiss of protection against other guys and once or twice engages on physical fights with other men to defend her. Why didn't they give him a horse and a sword? But the worse of it is that she does the whole ""oh you have to stop it I'm pretty grown up to take care of myself"" act, which I think was the movie saying to us ""hey look we know that men shouldn't be like that to women"", but her attitude and the way that situations are portrayed clearly mean for you to endorse the violent controlling guy who's in love with this silly virgin girl and wants her all to himself awnnnn",The Kissing Booth

It was an extremely adorable movie and after watching it I couldn't stop thinking about it all day. I am glad I took the time to watch it because the coupling is so cute and as well I love the actors they chose for the roles.

Elle is oversexualized, does strip shows like their her favorite hobby, goes on dates with people who sexually harass her, and hops into bed with the first guy who uses cheesy lines on her. Noah is a physcotic, violent, overprotective guy who is obsessive and creepy with his concern with Elle. Not only does he get in fights over her, and make sure no other guys get near her, he bosses her around like she's a two year old that still wears a tutu and a sparkly tiara. One of the worst parts of this movie is when Noah gets in a fight over what someone says about Elle, then proceeds to scream at her to get in his car while slamming the front of it. And what does Elle do about that? She gets in his car and then immediately has sex with him the first chance she gets.

252,thildaasander,Warning! This movie might give you cancer.,1,14 September 2018,"So I just wanna start with a simple sentence: HOW in the WORLD can even one person like this movie so much to even give it a 2 in ratings. There's only one movie on this earth that makes my blood boil like this and, you guessed it, it's this one. Every aspect of this movie sucks. The only thing good about it is the Mustang he gets, and that is the ONLY thing.All the characters are shallow like a kids pool at the water funland, they are thin as paper and nothing changes throughout the movie. They constantly make stupid decisions that doesn't make any sense whatsoever and affects everyone in a bad way. They break out of their personality traits multiple times and you can not say it's character development, because it's not, that is a phenomenon these characters are unfamiliar with. The story is bad, the acting is bad, it's WAY too predictable, the characters are annoying, it's so cheesy i almost threw up, it sexualizes young girls and even the music directing is bad. Also they are all stupid and don't realise THE most obvious things.One example of the characters themselves BREAKING OUT OF CHARACTER is when Elle is supposed to be this shy girl with really only one friend and she is super embarassed when she has to go to school in a skirt, and then, 20 minutes into the movie, she dances half naked in the boys locker room. That is not character development, it just doesn't make any sense.Also, the writing is really weird and awkward, I mean I was basically cringeing through the whole movie. I was convinced Lee was in love with Elle and that's why he disn't want her to date Noah, but no, it was just the awkward acting and the writing of this trainwreck.Also, I think you're supposed to be in Elles mind, hence the weird and awkward monologues that doesn't fit in anywhere, but because of the predictability you already know why Noah didn't tell her family about the embarassing incident, because it's so obvious.End rant/vent.Actual rating: 0/10",The Kissing Booth

Noah, the love interest, is abusive, screaming at Elle, banging on car doors, and demanding her to spend time away from her friends to be around him all of the time. How is that a good and healthy romance; I don't know. Elle isn't a saint either, going behind her best friend of 16 years's back and f###ing his brother, but you almost forget that with the negative connotations of Noah's behavior.
It isn't cute to manipulate people.
It isn't sexy when you demand someone to get into the car with them.

Elle and Noah are a classic girl and best friend's older brother deal, not unusual but not too cliched. ANd here is the real cool factor: Noah is an Alpha Male and knows what he wants in his girl and therefore Elle - before they're dating in order toa void future problems and provide clarity. He makes it clear to her and therefore makes their relationship loving and shock-free. He really cares and tells her not to go to parties so they be together and makes it clear this is not a loose so-called relationship, he is sweet and threatens boys who want to date her and gets into fights over her (yup hearts fluttering). There is one scene in particular where he fights someone over something they have said to Elle, and then puts his emotions on his sleeve.

Yes the relationship between Elle & Noah is alittle weird at first and controlling but you have to think for the majority of his life he looked at her as a sister type (which older brothers always try to tell their little sisters what to do) and then realizing she's not my sister the reason I don't want her with other guys is because he wanted her. His controlling & fighting gets better. I hate how everyone blames him obviously he can control it - see scene where Joel comes after him in jealous anger.

282,the_daria,"Tries to be an '80s teen movie, but not always in a good way",5,18 May 2018,"I can't decide if I like this movie. It certainly tries to be a 1980s rom-com like One Of The Guys or Sixteen Candles, but not always in a good way. The acting is pretty good. I was impressed with Joey King's (Elle) performance. I wasn't happy with Elle's choices in the story, but Joey's acting choices impressed me. I will keep an eye on her career. The writing and direction are concerning, especially in this #MeToo era. The main character Elle is half dressed or less in many, many scenes. Noah, the main love interest, is controlling to the point of sometimes threatening violence on Elle and physically fighting other characters. There's also underage drinking and sex. A lot of it. I think Elle should have suffered alcohol poisoning at one point. Another redeeming factor is Lee who completes an interesting character triangle. He's Noah's younger brother and Elle's best friend. He's also the one who insists on no romantic entanglements with family members so their friendship isn't threatened, which makes Noah a forbidden romantic interest to Elle. There is a very close bond between Elle and Lee. They have a healthy brother/sister-like friendship without the story threatening a cliche romance between them.

This was definitely a fun one. Typical coming of age story. A young girl falls for her bff's brother, who is also the most popular kid in school AND the biker boy your mom warned you about. Of course there are ups and downs. Molly Ringwald plays the boys' mom and a mother figure to our leading lady. A rom com for your daughters and anyone else that loves a good rom com.

How controlling Elle's crush Noah is makes me feel really uncomfortable. It reminds me of how some of my bad teenage boyfriends acted. The problem isn't showing controlling relationships, but this movie is trying to convey them as a sexy thing. I wouldn't let my daughter watch this... I'm not offended easily by any means, but this was very cringey. - other than that, the movie is an okay but cheesy rom com.

290,mlharrington18,Everything about this is gross,2,2 August 2018,"I could only get through half of the movie before I turned it off to spare myself. As a former teenage girl I can understand why parts of it would appeal to that demographic. But as a current adult who can identify abusive behavior and the sexualization of minors I cannot understand why the ideas shown in this movie are still being peddled to impressionable teenagers: romanticizing a guy who gets into fights, using one's underage body to get (male) attention, indulging and even rewarding manipulative behavior, agreeing to go out with someone who grabbed your butt in public without consent, caving to peer pressure when the popular girls tell you to drink... I thought we as a society were moving past all that.This movie contains every high school stereotype and cliché, but not even in an ironic or clever way, just a truly unoriginal and vapid way. All of the characters are one-dimensional and although Elle (Joey King) is cute and likable, the copious amounts of token awkwardness is too overwhelming. Her attempts to stand up for herself are admirable but half-hearted; she always ends up going back to whoever gave her crap at the first sign of an apology or ""good intention.""I would like to see more realness, as opposed to the ""OMG"" girls who are so fake it's actually sad. I wish the film had addressed the impact of Elle losing her mother more. Teenage girls don't move on like nothing's happened just because they have a best friend and some eye candy. I want to see less of a 16-year-old girl stripping in a locker room full of guys. The movie lacks any real emotional foundation that could make you overlook some of its flaws. For instance, Elle and Noah's relationship is basically only founded on physical attraction. That's it. One extra star for cinematography and scenery. Not feeling any more generous than that today.",The Kissing Booth

Not only is the acting bad, the script cringy and the overall photography of the film lacking, this is AN AWFUL MESSAGE FOR YOUNG GIRLS. Or girls/women of any and every age.
When a guy fights over a girl, scares away all other possible dates, tells her what to do and not do,... he doesn't do so because he loves her, he does so because he thinks she is his.
Enough is enough... let's have a romantic comedy where everyone envolved is respectful and respected. Let's romaticize that.

But about 20 minutes in, I honestly thought this was going to end with the older brother physically harming her and holding her captive. He literally had no redeeming qualities, and was super manipulative. The writing and storyline are terriblely underdeveloped! I don't know who wrote this but I can only imagine it was either a 15 year old girl, or some sick perverted older man. The moral of the story is appalling!! Everything that girl does is horrid, and everything that is done to her is horrid! But everybody acts like it's no big deal and that she is this amazing strong woman! 
 My biggest beef is the scene where he yells at her to get in the car, and then she does. If I were her I would have left and never looked back, because that is a a huge red flag for someone who is not a good person to be around. But instead she sleeps with him.

Everyone in the cast is just a skinny gorgeous looking flawless model superstar with beautiful hair and attractive body. And even then there are points where they actually have problems. The way I see it, they literally have nothing to complain about. Their lives are practically perfect! I can't feel sympathy for anyone, I can't connect with any of the characters, it feels strangely paced, the story is completely forgettable, I hardly remember what happened throughout the whole movie, I can barely tell anyone apart. None of the dialogue is convincing whatsoever; every 5 seconds someone shouts out a stupid slang term (OMG, Bruh, Gucci, etc, please kill me). Everyone is so fake, it's almost sickening.

312,evelynaesthetic,It's not good,3,9 June 2020,"The Kissing Booth never had the potential to be good, considering its source material is so flawed; it was a Wattpad story. Already going into the film, it felt like Wattpad to me.First of all, Noah Flynn is the embodiment of toxic masculinity. He hooks up with a bunch of girls, drives a motorcycle and gets in fights all the time? You're just asking for this review from tons of people, to be honest. We're not forgetting that his violence problems were so bad, his own brother thought he punched a girl.Continuing with Noah, he has absolutely no personality, kind of like Elle. They're both so vanilla and don't have anything going for them except they're kind of good looking. I don't see any reason they would be the main characters because they are the only ones who are absolutely not interesting. They could have put anyone else on the front cover, it would have made the movie at least a little bit tolerable.Second, we have to talk about the decision of making Elle's mother dead, for absolutely no reason. It does NOTHING in the plot, so why make it a part of it? I'm done with movies that kill parents just for fun, it's exhausting.Further more, Noah says that the only reason he likes Elle is because she doesn't fall to his feet immediately. The ONLY reason is because she's not a groupie. There is no other reason he states, it's just that.This movie tries so much to be something it's not by putting random dramatic moments into itself for absolutely no reason, just to freaking do it. It goes from being joyful and awesome to being a soap opera in like two seconds and for what?Finally, the movie is just pointless. I'm sorry, but there's an extremely long period of time where just nothing happens, it's just montage. And more and more into the movie, it just gets more and more cringe and dumb.I give it a three out of ten, and that's generous, because I do not see one reason why it would be good.",The Kissing Booth

323,SPcamert-1,Concerning due to a lack of consequence,4,23 May 2018,"So, I watched the second season of 13 Reasons Why and then I watched this movie.I thought that this seemed cute and might be a little more upbeat and positive to bring me back up from something so serious. The problem is that both of these titles relate to the same age group of kids. And while 13RW takes a very serious and dark line of thought given its story, I think this movie may be the more dangerous of the two. Let's take Elle and Noah's relationship. After a party where there is copious underage drinking, Noah is physically violent towards his classmate who is essentially trying to force himself on Elle. Rather than redress the boy with an explanation of the proper way to treat a woman, Noah proceeds instead to just beat the kid up. After this he commands Elle to get in his car (which she does because she is scared of him) and rather than take her home (as she requested) he takes her somewhere with the intent to have sex with her. I can see where the anger could be downplayed as a passionate response and the sex scene as spontaneous, but the danger lies within normalizing this response. You've got an older boy, pressuring a younger girl who is like a family member into getting in a car against her will and then taking her to a field instead of home and having sex with her without any discussion of STDs (Noah is a known 'player'), protection or birth control. Not to mention the implication that this boy was not only her first kiss but she lost her virginity to him. Keep in mind, this is just one scene. This movie seems to exist in a consequence-free universe all its own. I appreciate the writers trying to pull it back a bit with the eventual discovery by Lee with the consequence being that she's alone for the better part of two weeks. I also appreciated the implication that despite this being such a powerful love for her (it was her first after all) that the realism of the situation is that the boy is graduating to moving across the country and she'll probably never see him again. There are shades of a good lesson in here and the movie could have been just cute, but the movement into the more adults themes at the end without the adult consequences simply ruined it for me.",The Kissing Booth

So I guess it's now normal to have drunk photos of you in your underwear and not worry about it? And kissing strangers blindfolded for money? This seems a little too 50 Shades of Gray for the underage. And after all these bad decisions, she gets the guy of her dreams. Not likely. I need to add that if they were juniors/seniors in college it would be a much better movie for me. I actually liked the chemistry between the jock and the athletic girl - without giving her a makeover to make him fall in love with her.

331,delevator,All Round Cringey,3,13 May 2018,"I started watching with fairly low expectations. I was mostly nostalgic of my own teenage years (10-15 years ago; I am currently 28) when loads of similar high school romance/drama movies were being churned out. ""The Kissing Booth"" isn't missing any of the painfully worn out clichés: the high-school jock, the clique of mean arrogant bitches, the underdog of a main character, the high school prom as a climax moment, etc. However, this movie proved to set a new low. I could tell right away that the cast is mostly extremely mediocre (in some parts strikingly ill-fitting), and this didn't help to sell the very poor screenplay and practically non-existent story, which really felt like such an ineptly put together collection of predictable cheesiness, that I couldn't help but think of a certain high school drama novel I had once read, which was written by a 15-year-old girl. And what do you know! The book this movie is based on was written by a 15-year-old girl (she is 21 by now but was 15 when she wrote it). I couldn't believe the chances but at the same time wasn't surprised. It is very obvious to me that the author lacked the experience and the skill to build a solid story and to tell it believably (yes, even a ridiculous high school flick). The screenwriter didn't exactly make a masterpiece of it either. Why anyone would pick this book to turn into a movie is beyond me.
I am giving it 3 stars because of some acceptable cinematographic moments and because I *did* go in looking for a bit of corniness. And well, I guess for overall effort too.
It may be that I'm too old and bitter to buy it, and that the moments I would have found dreamy at 15 are the ones that made me roll my eyes at 28. Either way, these are my 2 cents.",The Kissing Booth

It was for sure entertaining to my surprise. But I had a few problems with it. Noah being very controlling to Elle is not a good example for young teens who will be watching this movie. Very predictable that the brother was going to find out accidentally and start a huge fight. I assume this is what you would expect from a teen rom-com. The one thing I thought was funny, was Noah stopped showing up for school and didn't seem into school, but yet went to Harvard? They atleast could of made him seem studious.

This is a movie that is a little heartbreaking and awkward at some point but mostly fun! Really enjoyed it. Love the story and the characters. The script is a bit poor sometimes but it doesn't make it bad. It's totally one of my favorite movies of all time and I have watched A LOT of movies. Trust me.

350,heartcartography,"If you can suspend reality and judgment, this is a tasty piece of fluff.",4,2 June 2018,"I am an aficionado of teen/coming of age movies. My Dad and I share a love for this genre even though I haven't been a teen for a while.This flick is like a ""13 year old girl's dreams"" come to life. Which is a good thing (adventurous, dreamy) and not (unrealistic plot points, unwise thinking etc).It is possible to portray something heart-breaking in minutes (see Pixar's ""UP"") but the opening to this film left me scratching my head. The tone is bizarrely jovial and dead-serious.Sex is portrayed very unrealistically and casually. A house party (at a mansion that is gargantuan in proportions) is raucous with no ill effects or consequences. The main love interest seems to have serious psychological issues that result in violence but everyone seems unconcerned. He is controlling of the younger girl, even when she asks him to stop telling her what to do. But hey, his abs are great, right??I was lying awake last night pondering how many things didn't make sense after completion of the film. How the cliches did not have cleverness behind them. And, how if I had a daughter I would want to discuss the messages with her after viewing.But, it is light-hearted and entertaining and has several cute nods to other coming of age movies.",The Kissing Booth
351,escapeeshana,Why is no one calling out this movie?,1,7 September 2018,"After all the backlash that Fifty Shades of Grey and Twilight have received for their overly controlling and stalker-like male love interests, I'm shocked that The Kissing Booth hasn't received nearly the same amount of criticism. Despite being released on Netflix, the most popular online streaming platform, people have not seemed to notice how unhealthy the relationship portrayed in this movie is. Aside from being a terrible movie (stuffed with clichés, awful jokes and wildly unrealistic high school tropes), the character of Noah is dangerously violent and manipulative. One scene shows him demanding that Elle get in his car, multiple times, while she walks away. He then bangs the car hood with such force that she stops, her expression shocked and scared. The film then shows her effectively succumbing to this shock/fear and entering the car, at which point he doesn't drive her home but, without any notice, drives her to a remote location instead where they share a ""romantic"" night together.To romanticise a relationship such as this is an awful precedent to set for impressionable teenage girls, who can learn from this movie that a boyfriend with a hot face and body is worth enduring any amount of emotional torture for.Their toxic relationship isn't even the only unacceptable part of this movie; one of the early scenes shows Elle having her butt slapped (underneath her skirt) by a random guy at her high school. She is effectively sexually assaulted on school grounds, yet the guy only gets detention (the same punishment as she receives for violating dress code), and then successfully asks her out on a date! She seems to view his actions against her as cheeky, maybe endearing - as if it's all justified by saying ""boys will be boys"".In the era of the #metoo and #Timesup campaign, I'm truly shocked at how this movie could be released on such a wide reaching platform, and still entertain a certain amount of positive reviews. I'm surprised that buzzfeed, which usually criticises the smallest of offences by anyone/thing in popular culture, managed to only write positive articles about this movie. All in all, if I could rate this movie 0 stars, I would.",The Kissing Booth
352,pearlyrain,Everything I Hate About a Romance Movie,4,22 July 2020,"To be honest, for anyone who liked romance, this movie isn't even half bad. I knew what I was getting into when I decided to watch a romance. I never liked romance, and even if I do end up liking a movie or series with the romance genre, the romance can't be the main focus of the story, or the story ends tragically. The Kissing Booth didn't technically end as well as anyone would've wanted it to be, but for once, I wasn't judging the ending, I was judging the journey.I heard a friend talk about how she enjoyed this movie once, and now, having seen it myself, I'd like to hear her opinion on it again.First of all, I'd like to compliment Joey King and Joel Courtney's acting, especially Joel. He nailed every scene, especially that one in the lawn. He was so hurt and even if I said I didn't like the movie that much, I definitely felt that one scene, his emotions. Between the three main characters in the movie, I really felt the most connected to Lee and how he was always the little brother, living in the shadow of his hotter, more popular older brother. His short dialogue on how Noah ""always gets everything he wants"" was one of my favorite lines in the movie.I also really liked the color scheme. It was bright, warm, summery. I've never been to LA but I have a few good ideas of what kind of vibes it gave, and the movie really did scream Los Angeles, with again, the color scheme, beaches, warm weather, not to mention the huge Hollywood sign anyone will notice.There was another thing that I really liked, and it was honestly a really small detail in the movie, could've been slipped in there to add life to it I guess, since everyone was so focused on the main characters' relationship. The prom memory lane scene, with Elle's short monologue of how she was glad to be able to make something that lasted. There, I really did believe the movie was going to start teach us lessons and give us morals, but haha guess not.Anyway, everything I didn't like or wasn't comfortable with.I don't know, I really find the story cliche. It was always a ""my best friend's brother"" or a ""my brother's best friend"" kind of thing, and I think I've seen enough of things with the same theme. I shouldn't be judging any of the characters because everyone should feel free to love anyone, and falling in love is never a mistake, and seeing it logically, to grow up alongside a childhood friend who grew up to be hot and popular, I'm not going to blame Elle for it, even if the theme was a bit overused.One character in particular (who's actor I liked the least, because their acting was so stiff and unnatural) was displaying some really unhealthy behaviors, and I really didn't like them, while I was watching and even now. I just don't see the purpose of liking such a character, who force toxic behavior in a relationship and pick fights to get what they want. They had anger management issues, and a character like that shouldn't receive one of the main spots, and for what? I don't think their issue with anger management and patience had anything to do with the story itself but for romance purposes.I wasn't sure why anything happened in the movie. Haters to lovers trope was always a theme I really enjoyed watching, and best friends to lovers came in second place with a short gap between the two. I really thought the movie was going to give me something of the sort. But one already got a partner in the first half of the movie and the other one's entire plot in the movie was of theirs with an entirely different person. The trope just couldn't work and I had to sit there commentating almost every scene that made me cringe.Being a more open-minded person, though, I heard plenty of people liked the movie. Some even repeatedly compared The Kissing Booth to To All The Boys I've Loved before. If we were comparing, I'd definitely prefer the latter. First of all, it had representation, and the love story wasn't as dumb as the one here, where the characters are driven by nothing but emotion, while the one in the other movie was driven by their own selfish wants until their motives shifted. And I think that's what a romance movie should do, make the characters realize that what they want isn't the answer. In To All The Boys I've Loved Before, Lara Jean and Peter were driven by their wants, so did Harper and Charlie in Set it Up, and the most distinguishable one I can point out was Margaret and Andrew from The Proposal.It wasn't the best romance movie I've seen, though a lot of people say it's good because it doesn't involve heavy themes and focus on these two's relationship. Watch it if you want something light and simple and smooth, but really, don't if you want something more stimulating.",The Kissing Booth

363,jennifertraini,Cute story but does it send the right message to young girls?,6,23 May 2018,"This is a classic romantic comedy based on the bff's hot brother and good girl dinamic. The plot is pretty standard but we don't really expect something outstanding and innovative from a romantic comedy aimed at teenagers, right? That being said, it really sends a bad messages about relationships. Noah (Jacob Elordi) is really manipulative even before his relationship with Elle starts. He gets into fights because other guys are interested in her, he's aggressive, he threatens guys interested in her and tells them not to ask her out... At one point she gets upset at his agressive behavior and leaves, he runs after her and starts shouting at her to get in his car, which she does eventually and they end up having sex for the first time that same night. I mean, why allow such a flow of events? To me it felt like he was being ""rewarded"" for being overprotective, it felt like being overprotective like that is a good thing. IT IS SO NOT. The whole situation made me cringe.Anyway the casting was good (Jacob Elardi is definitely a sight for sore eyese) and one can sense the chemistry among the three main characters: you can tell they are truly close to each other.

What I didn't expect was for me to have such a strong hope that young girls don't watch this movie. The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because the acting is actually pretty good for a movie of this genre!
**Spoiler Alert**
There are many reasons that this movie bothered me. First, I felt that the main character was portrayed as a piece of property by her best friend and her boyfriend (they end up fighting over her and basically giving her ultimatums.) The boyfriend is also very controlling of her -telling her what to do, where to go, keeping other boys from talking to her. She's pretty assertive and tells him she doesn't like it, but it still rubbed me the wrong way. It seems because he's the hott/bad boy/jock, for the most part, he can get away with this type of abuse. 
Another detail that killed me was that Noah is also the school player (of course -he's the hott/bad boy/jock)but somehow, she changes him and they fall in love. The second time they kiss, which is her second kiss EVER, is also the same night they declare that they are a couple and they have sex on the beach. It is not implied that they used protection, either, and with teen pregnancies on the rise, it needs to be apparent. Also, to me, their relationship developed way too fast and shows girls that in order to be in a ""real"" relationship with a boy, you have to have sex with him. 
Finally, at the end of the movie when he goes off to college on the other side of the country, she says that she finally feels like she has all this confidence and can do anything all because of falling in love with that boy. That was the nail in the coffin to me. The character was great all on her own, she didn't need a boy to show her that.",The Kissing Booth

Jock Noah demonstrated no intellect yet was on his way to Harvard. The general disapproval of Noah, you'd assume he had a dark side on par with animal cruelty. How can Lee maintain a pure platonic vision of Elle after she blossomed as a woman. I mean, sorry, but: hormones. That wasn't explored one bit.The casting of Elle and Noah. Noah is head and shoulders above Elle. He is hunched over like Quasimodo in all their intimate scenes. I don't know if this was deliberate, to create a visual clash in compatibility, but I was half expecting Elle to realise Lee was the one for her all along. That was until Lee landed himself a girlfriend.The ""Rules"" are arbitrarily shoehorned in to justify the conflict in Elle and Noah's romance, hence the dilemma of the whole movie.

You know the friendzone best friend the bad and hot guy but it's a good guy when it comes to Elle, sexist comments, the ""mean "" girls, the ugly guy, the parties and all that, half naked teenagers, the relationship montage, the whole love confession in front of the whole school and stuff...",The Kissing Booth

387,courtney_cairns-83876,Just terrible,1,23 May 2018,"One of the worst movies I have probably ever seen. I actually don't mind cringey, cheesey movies like this, it's something light to watch when you're down in the dumps, and it has a tone similar to the likes of Angus, Thongs, and Perfect Snogging. But there are so many problems. The love interest is so unlikeable, he's controlling and I would go as far to say abusive. He is so physically aggressive I would worry for Elle's wellbeing if the relationship continued. Like the scene where he slammed his hand onto his car and yelled at her to get in? Immediate dislike from thereon. Anyone who has been in an abusive relationship would see how not okay this interaction alone is, nevermind how controlling he is through the entire movie. Did anyone else notice that he only became flirty around the time she got naked on that pool table, whereas before he called her a little sister? Like, is this guy just written to be terrible? I really think he should have been out of the picture long before the ending of this film, every time he came onscreen my face dropped. I can't believe she still went after him after how he made her cry like every single day. I could talk for hours about how bad this guy is, but I think you get the picture (telling her he loved her infront of their entire class too, pressuring for an answer, is just being a jackass). What was up with that weird subplot of her mom being dead, too? Like, it served literally no purpose other than a poor attempt at pulling heartstrings, aside from being a stupid plot device for Lee's mom to tell her that a true friendship never dies or something. I think you see her family about five times during the movie. Even in the beginning of the movie, it just goes from 'I had to say goodbye to my mom... THEN DANCED MORE WITH LEE AND GAPED MORE AT NOAH' and it's like, what? Uh, okay? I guess we're swiftly moving on? Ugh. It's like a fifteen year old girl wrote this film - oh wait. No offence to the author, because, as stated, she was literally fifteen when she wrote it.",The Kissing Booth

Jacob Elordi is so HOT and Joey king is so pretty they were a good match. The only thing i didn't like was the fact that her friend hated his brother and bestfriend together. Sure it's weird but if that's really your bestfriend shouldn't you be happy for her anyway? he legit stopped talking to her for a while all because of a rule they made when they were 6. made no sense!! we def need a followup because i have to see if they're still together. my god is he tall and she is so tiny lol, in the movie she looks like she's 5'2 and him 6'5 or something lol.

Nostalgic throwback to John Hughes movies as I've read some to claim (including the NYT). But along with these things, Kissing Booth comes with some pretty blatant and unforgivable themes around emotional manipulation, partner abuse, and domestic violence. Controlling men are not romantic heroes anymore, y'all.For Netflix to release this in 2018 - with #MeToo being a topic every.single.day - feels tone deaf and patriarchical in the worst of ways.

And not only Noah, but also Lee was a bit controlling by adding that stupid rule. So she can't date your brother for your sake? screw this man. And when he finds out about their relationship he begins to act like a little child , ignoring his childhood friend?

409,idaannat,"Enjoyable and a good ""teaching"" movie",8,4 March 2020,"First off, comments about Joey Fisher (Elle) not being thin enough are ridiculous. No wonder girls get eating disorders!As an adult female and mother of a 15-year-old girl, I had no real problems with this movie. Anyone who believes rom coms are realistic is expecting too much. My daughter and I watch many movies like this together and we always talk about them afterwards. She understands that the actors in these movies are normally older than their characters. At least this time, not too much older. I believe the actors playing Elle and Noah were 18 and 20 in real life when this was filmed, so 1-2 years older than their characters. Heck, I remember when the movie GREASE came out. Most of those actors were in their late 20s/early 30s playing high schoolers! Same with the TV show GLEE.Some comments here really surprised me. Ideally, I would love for my daughter to not even be thinking about sex until she's 30 (ha), but folks who think kids are not fooling around in high school are deluding themselves. I have 3 brothers and I knew 2 of my brothers were having sex in high school (I did not). My daughter often hears our high school stories. She knows her uncles were not angels at that age, but she sees them now and what great adults they are.Back to the movie. Were there scenes that were unrealistic? Sure. A real person is not going to jump out of a window and land on a trampoline and then change trajectory to land in the adjacent pool; and wouldn't Elle have realized it was Noah in the car instead of Lee considering the huge difference in their body sizes? Yes. But again, when we watch these types of movies, we know many scenes aren't realistic.I understand about the #MeToo movement and it's great that unacceptable behavior is being called out. But expecting TV shows and movies to always show an ideal scenario is dumb. Stick to Hallmark if you are expecting perfect guys and gals and only a minor kiss at the end. Again, I mention the movie GREASE. Do folks not remember that Rizzo was sleeping around and even thought she was pregnant?After the scenes where Elle wears a way-too-short skirt and ends up in the principal's office - was Noah right to say that dressing like that might be asking for it? Maybe. Does dressing scantily mean a guy can grope you? No. Does dressing scantily invite unwanted attention? Absolutely. Just like our right to free speech. Yes, we have freedom of speech in that the government can't stop you from saying what you want, but the law does not protect you from the ramifications that result from your choice of speech. Same situation here. Also, would Elle go out with a guy that grabbed her back? Maybe. Folks often cross the line in the name of teasing. This guy did cross the line, and should rightly be called out, but does that make him totally unworthy? No. Plus, that was probably very believable from a high school perspective. Again, teaching moment.In some comments here, folks talked about how both Lee and Noah treated Elle like property. I didn't see it that way. Even though the movie did not go into detail, there is obvious friction between the two brothers. Noah is the ""golden boy"" and Lee has an inferiority complex when it comes to his brother. No wonder he sees his friendship with Elle as something he has that Noah doesn't. He cherishes it. As life-long BFFs he and Elle are beyond close. The last thing he wants is his brother (of all people) to have a special relationship (that he isn't a part of) with Elle. That is totally understandable. And let me just say that I can relate as one of my brothers dated my best friend for a while.The movie never really explains where Noah's anger comes from. After watching it, I asked my daughter why she thought Noah had anger issues. We came up with a lot of possibilities. Would getting into fights signal a deeper problem? It could, sure. It wouldn't necessarily mean that he would batter a girl, though. In fact, the movie makes it pretty clear that it's the opposite. He's almost too protective and gets in fights over that. Plus, in the fight between Noah and Lee, Noah is the one trying to calm his brother down. Also, Noah's anger could be a family dynamic playing out. Noah is the golden boy who is obviously very smart. Maybe he's acting out from family pressure to do well? Who knows? Anyway, the point is, my daughter and I discussed it. And besides, she knows to avoid folks who are mean to animals, etc. That's a bigger red flag to me than anything Noah did.The bottom line is Elle took control and decided what she wanted. My daughter liked that. Me too. She rightly told Lee that rules they came up with at age 6 don't work anymore. As they get older, their relationship will change. It has to. Is this movie perfect? No, but my daughter and I liked it and had great conversations because of it. Win-win, in my book. (And we're looking forward to the sequel).",The Kissing Booth

443,km-251-961730,Lousy screenwriting ruins what could have been an okay movie,2,18 May 2018,"This movie annoyed me because based on it's source material (basically a teen Harlequin romance) it could have been a halfway decent teen movie if the screenwriters hadn't so clearly phoned it in when good writers could have elevated the material. The first sign of lazy writing is the completely ridiculous timeline... It's the first day of school, it's the fall carnival, now we are making banners for Prom and you're leaving for college in a few weeks...Next, Noah's penchant for violence isn't dealt with as clearly as in the book (which could have done more) and when he does get into fights on screen it is to protect his little brother and Elle. The second fight that is a ""moment"" was for tackling a kid who called Elle ""sloppy seconds"" after he tried to force her to be alone with him. Noah didn't overreact-the guy deserved worse. Another example, in the book before the two main characters sleep together, Noah lets her know he's willing to wait because he just wants to be with her. This demonstrates how deeply he feels about her. The ""big"" moment when Lee finds out about the couple-the screenwriters lifted the scenes straight out of when Dawson finds out about Joey and Pacey on Dawson's Creek. Lastly, the ending doesn't fit the rest of the story. In the book Noah is torn about Harvard because he doesn't want to lose Elle-they are going to do all they can to make it work-this fits the story so far. It was like the writers decided they wanted the shot of Elle riding the motorcycle so they just wrote the scenes to get there with no regard for who the characters are. Also the way the story starts, it would have made sense for Lee to be there at the end-best friend always there for her.",The Kissing Booth

479,sweetpolly16-172-935058,This movie was great but had some issues,10,5 June 2018,"Now, don't get me wrong, I adored this movie and the characters made me melt! But there were a few issues I had throughout. 1) the way Lee treats Elle is absolutely ridiculous. In his little speach after he finds out about Noah and Elle he proceeds to talk about her as if she was his property! Something ""I had that Noah didn't"" ??? Not cool, dude. But it doesn't stop there. He treats her poorly as she tries to apologize and even when he forgives her it's still an unspoken date-him-and-i'll-never-be-your-friend-again sort of situation which pisses me off to no end! Would you want to stand in the way of your best friend being in love? No! Would you want to make your best friend tag along as the third wheel to your prom when she could be with her boyfriend? NOOOOO! 2) moving on before I really start to ramble about how much lee annoys me... They all seem to dislike Noah for some reason and I don't get it? Her dad is blatantly against her being with Noah, like, what did he do that we are unaware of???! 3) what was that ending?!!!! When I watch romantic movies of any sort (which is not often) I NEED to see a happy ending! I would have been fine if Noah had went off to college and she left it at ""maybe things would work out with Noah, I hoped they would."" But instead she ends it with ""or maybe they wouldn't."" ???! Are you basing all of this on him not waving? Because it seems like it and that's just not okay! I get that you were TOTALLY wanting him to turn back and wave, but maybe it was too hard for him! Maybe if he turned back he wouldn't be able to leave or he'd start crying etc etc... This last one isn't a complaint on my part, just something I feel like adding: I'm not really going to go into super-detail as to why Noah slamming his hand on the car and demanding Elle get into the car didn't bother me, but I will say in short that to me that was a very realistic part of the movie, it showed true emotion and he seemed more desperate than he did angry at all and even if he was a little angry, they both OBVIOUSLY have emotions overflowing because they're falling for each other when they know they shouldn't. People are going to let their emotions get the best of them at certain points.And of course, others say Noah was overprotective/controlling but I didn't really see it to the point that they did. Sure, I saw that he was telling other boys to not date her and was telling her not to go to parties, but to me that was just him trying to protect her while also trying to not seem like he wanted her. But that's just my opinion, others could and will see it in a totally different light.Maybe it's just because I've had overbearing relationships and he didn't seem like that guy to me, but whatever. Despite these flaws, this movie is genuinely one of my favorites. They made all of the characters loveable in there own way and Elle was all too relatable. In my opinion (I know some will disagree) movies aren't made to be absolutely realistic, otherwise we wouldn't really watch them, we'd just go live our lives. Movies are full of suspension of disbelief and I see no problem with that. Movie are supposed to make us feel things and this one did a good job of that.

Elle and Noah are a classic girl and best friend's older brother deal, not unusual but not too sappy. But here's the real problem: Noah is extremely controlling and manipulative of Elle- before they're even dating. He orders her around and expects her to do as he says, tells her not to go to parties, threatens boys who want to date her, and gets into fights over her. There is one scene in particular where he fights someone over something they have said to Elle, and then he screams at Elle to get into his car. Is this a good relationship for young girls to be idolizing? Do we want them to think that's okay for boys to control them?

491,kristofferloistantano-47909,IT'S REALLY BAD. Joel Courtney's acting was the only good thing to come out of this film.,1,25 June 2018,"*Spoilers ahead* I made an account just to share my insights. Also, I wonder a lot why there are many positive reviews on this film. To be honest, I watched this hoping the trailer would fool me. I was already rooting for the younger brother while watching just the trailer. After the movie, I ended up disappointed. Very disappointed.But that's not the reason why this movie is horrible.I am really angry with how the events played out. The message of this movie is something that would come out of a delusional and innocent person who thinks love is the answer for everything (if such person exists). While it's good that at some parts the main female character is aware that her love interest has some really negative points (and these negative points could clearly lead to a problematic relationship), it's frustrating how she ignores all that and washes it all away because she really thinks he's the one. The guy is controlling, even before they were even dating. He has anger management issues. He dismisses other guys from trying to get close with the MC and calls it ""protecting her"". He always gets in a fight. The violent, physical type of fight. He is bossy himself and calls it cute when the girl tries to boss him around (Okay this one honestly doesn't show anything bad, but I don't know why I find this very annoying). I don't really know how some could see their interactions as romantic. It's all really cringy. And do not even hit me up with the whole ""what's up with the negative reviews? This is fiction!"" kind of reasoning because works of fiction, especially teenage flicks like this, should bring about a good lesson for its viewers. And even more so when the target viewers are young girls. ""WHat's wrong with it? People fall in love with the wrong people. It happens in real life."" YES.IT.DOES. So why should we show it in films and not fix it on the film? Why romanticize the notion instead? Okay. And know what? The problematic love interest doesn't even show signs of fixing himself to be a better person. The least he did was apologize to the father of the girl, and apologize to the brother for hiding their relationship. That's it. Apologies are huge. But trying hard not to make the same mistakes again are better, specially when he's trying to build a serious relationship.Yes, the emotions got bottled up because the girl was in love with the brother for so long, yet she can't show it because she made some rules with her best friend (who is the love interest's brother) at six years old that relatives are off limits. Yeah that could be a huge factor for the girl being unable to control her emotions when she finally experienced being with the off-limits brother, but that doesn't change the fact that the their relationship could become problematic. And this possible problematic relationship in the future IS THE PROBLEM of the movie, and not the rules, yet the movie imposes that just because she loves and respects her best friend so much, he doesn't have the right to tell her who she's gonna be with. It seems as though the movie itself doesn't know what the bigger problem is.There are still more minor details that really threw me off with this film but I'll stop here. I don't remember when the last time a film has disappointed me so much.",The Kissing Booth
492,clm0510,I liked Lee better?,4,12 May 2018,"The premise of the movie follows Elle and Lee, best friends since birth. Literally. Their friendship as young adults is refreshingly honest and it had me rooting for them the entire time! But, if you're going to watch with the hopes they'll end up together you'll be very disappointed. Instead, Elle falls for the older, bad-boy brother of Lee named Noah (who is way taller making for some awkward frame shots) and keeps it a secret from Lee for the majority of the film. When Lee finds out it makes for major teenage drama which was alright. (Bravo to Joel Courtney for growing up to be such a stud!!)

However, I do think they could have done a lot better job with explaining the character of Noah, I mean everyone couldn't just hate him for nothing, or just because he got into fights a lot...I would have been really interested in something like Elle getting to know his ""dark side"", maybe some kind of depression or past trauma.

Noah might control Elle sometimes but Elle never lets it slide and she defends herself. Girls need to see that these days that you never have to do what your man tells you to do.

I did find it slightly problematic that Elle stripped in almost every social scene and that they had sex after sharing two make out sessions. It seems pretty unrealistic for a girl to go from never being kissed to losing her virginity with no problem. Also, they glossed over how a fight prone, school skipping, football player would just get into Harvard.

506,devnyannie,Imperfect actors make for more realistic movie,7,13 May 2018,"Ok, I've watched a lot of chick flicks and teen movies in my life. As a teen girl, I'm basically a connoisseur. Everyone is saying it was predictable, and some typical things were, as they pretty much inescapably are in any given teen movie. I was actually on my toes the whole movie. I had no idea what was going to happen, it was a lot less predictable than I expected! The best thing about it was that the star (Joey Kind, I think) isn't super hot. She's average, maybe even below average looks. And the hot main guy didn't have perfect teeth. Like, they're kind of normal looking people. It always annoys me in teen movies when they're all perfect, unrealistic people, with perfect matte skin, and glowing white, straight teeth. They defied that, and that left me extremely satisfied. If you like chick flicks, watch this movie!",The Kissing Booth
507,kellyblount,Adorable Romance!,10,12 May 2018,"TEN STARS!The Kissing Booth is pure perfection! It's a sweet, funny, and relatable heartwarming tale about the trials and tribulations of high school romance.This movie follows the life of high schooler, Elle Evans. She and her best friend, Lee Flynn are inseparable. The only problem? Elle has a crush on Lee's older brother, Noah, which is forbidden by a list of rules Elle and Lee agreed upon at the age of six. When Noah and Elle kiss, all of the rules go out the back window and they begin sneaking around. Will Lee find out his best friend has been seeing his hot older brother or will Elle uphold their friendship pact? Watch The Kissing Booth to find out!",The Kissing Booth
508,theajant,Not what I expected,2,12 May 2018,"Where do we start?... The whole movie was predictable and cliche' the script was terrible and not funny at all and the acting was mediocre. The trailer made it look decent and like it could be a fun ""chick flick"" love story but upon the first 5 minutes I knew it was going to be bad. 
The story was just bad... so sorry for the spoiler but what girl or woman would let a man slap her ass and then want to go on a date with them? I mean really? Can we say no self respect. And as the movie progressed it just got cringier and cringier. I gave it a couples stars for effort but was just disappointed in this terrible movie. I don't blame the actors just the writers for creating the most predictable, cliche' and unfunny attempt at a romance movie. Sorry not sorry.",The Kissing Booth

I don't exactly agree with the reviews that say she has to strip to get his attention because that isn't true. How the main character handles each situation is exactly how a teenager would.

Then she falls for a guy who tries to control her. This main character is so unlikeable because she has no guts.

I can handle cheesy dialogue but when she actually said I'm not gonna be one of your conquest after she kissed him, I was over the whole thing. They have her clumsily or stupidly showing off her underwear several times and that's the reason Noah notices her, like really. And after all that nonsense the movie ends with her basically saying that if they didn't last long distance it's cool - like can you have just let it end without the nonsense dialogue she added to it. Worst part is there playing the song from Breakfast Club but that movie was worth something, the ending worth the epic song , this was not.

530,kendallbrijohnson,Disappointing,2,19 May 2018,This movie was so over dramatic for what it was about. The acting was good if it was more of a serious situation but it's so dumb and stupid and completely over dramatic. The friendship between Elle and Lee had really good chemistry but Noah and Elle were completely awkward. The actress that plays Elle is really short and young looking so the whole movie felt like statutory rape with Noah looking 25. The timing throughout the movie was sometimes quick and awkward and the some scenes of partying and stuff seemed like try hard high school movie stuff. Also the other characters other than the main ones were really cringey and stupid and over the top theatrical. It was just disappointing to see someone like Joel Courtney going from absolute amazing movies like Super 8 to this really bad one.,The Kissing Booth

I used to be a snob in terms of what I should watch or not; but lately, I just don't care anymore. Also, I do enjoy 'bad' movies once in a while. These kind of films that you just know that are going to be, at least, a little bit problematic. So although I was pretty sure that 'The Kissing Booth' wasn't going to change my life; I decide to watch it to spend a few hours laughing and feeling warm inside. 'The DUFF' is a good example of what I was looking for:I didn't get it right with The Kissing Booth.All the 'bad-super-hot' boy who always get everything what he wants, was way too much. I mean, what the hell was happening in Ellen mind while she was super ok with an stranger touching her and then her love interest, saying was she asking for it for wearing a short skirt? And then, all this drama about Elle being perceived as a thing between the brothers. If Lee or whatever was his name, wasn't in love with Elle, what the hell did worry about his best friend just dating his older brother?Don't make me start about the script and the acting. 
And the catarsis, was way too...superficial even for a movie of this kind. I enjoyed 'The Kissing Booth' in some moments, yes. But it was too sexist really, and not well written at all. I didn't even care about the characters.",The Kissing Booth

Whenever I thought I would find a great movie like this one I kept getting let down and started losing hope for a bit. I almost didn't even watch this movie, but already 10 minutes into the film, I knew it would be great. It has a great combination of your favorite movies from the 80s and 90s and a modern day love story. The casting is great and the chemistry between the characters is great and very understandable as the main love interest is dating in real life. At times, some scenes were slightly cheesy, but overall the film was solid. I even felt that the cheesy scenes fit well with the movie and balanced out nicely. I believe this film was truly amazing and is one of the best, if not the best, coming of age/teenage films I have seen. I think that the people rating this film poorly have never liked this genre of film because they would love it if they did. I greatly enjoyed watching this film and highly recommend that you watch whenever possible because it will not let you down when you do.",The Kissing Booth
555,reaganelee,wow this is bad,2,14 May 2018,"I honestly made an account just to say wow. This movie is bad. The acting sucks and the plot has so many holes that it doesn't make sense to anyone with more that 3 brain cells. If you're looking for a ""girl's night in"" flick, please watch something a little more intelligent? For the sake of female pride? This movie makes girls look like idiots who go weak at the knees every time a relatively not ugly guy looks their way.

563,fionajhansen,Glorifies abusive relationships,1,16 May 2018,"As this was featured on Netflix I gave it a go. I was fine with it until the main character's love interest threatened other guys at her school (potentially for years) to keep them from expressing interest in her. Even after that I still kept on with it for a bit. Unfortunately, as mfbeif said, the scene where they argue was deeply problematic for me. He punches another guy in the stomach, then as she runs off, chases her into a dark parking lot and yells at her and hits the car until she gets scared and goes in. It gave me flashbacks of being in an abusive relationship and I immediately stopped watching. I understand this movie being made, my opinion isn't everything, but really disappointed in Netflix and in it being considered to be featured on the main page.",The Kissing Booth

566,clardanimonterroyo,Extremely predictable and unrealistic,4,16 May 2018,"First off, this movie is derived from a Wattpad story, so that pretty much tells you the depth it has. The portrayal of high school is very unrealistic and almost feels like a campy satire of traditional high school cliches from the early 2000s. Not only that, but the characters are far from complex - they have little to no personality or development, and it seems as if the message of the entire movie is based on outer appearance alone. The predictability of the film is also a factor, as you can literally guess the ending of the movie and how the whole plot pans out just from the trailer that Netflix plays before you click on the title. That's how vapid it is. However, I really enjoyed Joey King's performance, and I hope to see her in better works in the future. The Kissing Booth is fun to watch when there's nothing else to pick from, but that's about it.",The Kissing Booth
567,alexttaylor,Avoid like the plague,1,17 May 2018,"While watching The Kissing Booth, I was only met with immense confusion. Confused on why I was still watching a terribly acted, poorly written, with annoying/unlikable characters and an out-of-touch coming of age story and confused on whether this movie was a parody of itself due to how laughable it was. The movie lacks a clear understanding of its target audience of the average teenage girl, whereas I am confused whether the target audience is actually for extremely rich teenage girls who just so happen to act like a terrible actress all at the same time. Possibly? Who knows. Please avoid unless you want to waste your time on a very, very, very lazy movie.",The Kissing Booth
568,peebles-57621,It Could've Been Great,5,17 May 2018,"I've been seeing this movie around the internet for a while, and a lot of people said that it was great, so I gave it a try. I was expecting it to be a proper rom-com teenage movie, but instead it was a cringey movie which was romanticizing a possible problematic relationship. Noah, who was the love interest of the main character, was very controlling even before they were in a relationship. On the other hand, the main character was just as bossy. There were a lot of cringe-worthy moments in this movie, especially with a lot of lines and with the party scene. The actors were great, though it felt weird that the leading man looked like a 20+ old guy trying to get a 15 year-old girl through cheesy and cliche lines. All in all, this movie had potential, but not enough to become a sensational rom-com movie.",The Kissing Booth
569,fwhitthread,Amazing :),10,17 May 2018,"Really good , I definitely want a second one. Target audience is definitely teen girls and can be slightly cringy at some times but the characters are hilarious and make it less so. People saying hat it glorifies abusive relationships are sort of correct however, he never hurts Elle and he references to how he will never hurt her and even though he gets in a lot of fights in the film, it shows that fighting is a bad thing to do from the other characters expressions and views towards it. Also the people saying that it was too predictable and awful have to remember that a teen girl first wrote this on wattpad and need to take that into account .",The Kissing Booth

Its aimed at teenage girls yes but im a woman in my 30's and i just loved it! Its hilarious with some great one liners! A great little love story and good actors which were perfectly cast imo. Loved the soundtrack too!
The movie reminded me a bit of 10 things i hate about you and had a definite 80's / 90's vibe to it, we just dont get many movies like this anymore and its such a shame. 
In regards to promoting abusive relationships, pffft!! Noah is a teenager and Elle has been like a little sister to him all his life. He is over protective and doesnt want to see her date any of the guys interested in her because he knows they are players and he knows they wont treat her right. I think the story is beautiful and the friendship between Elle and Lee is amazing and so entertaining
Jacob Elordi (Noah) was great in his breakout role and very nice to look at and an Aussie! Joey King (Elle) was so entertaining and carried the movie well. I loved Joel Courtney (Lee) He cracked me up, such a great cast that had so much chemistry between them all. 
The fact that Elordi and King met eachother on set and fell for eachother and are now together IRL makes the movie even more special and has hands down become one of my favourite movies, a cult classic and a must see for its genre!",The Kissing Booth

582,willemsvictor,OKAY for its kind,6,24 May 2018,"I see a lot of extremely bad reviews on this movie and as usual, I don't blame them, they just review a movie different from how I like to do it. I like to put the movie in its context first, it makes a lot more sense to me and it refrains me from losing interest in potentially overlooking a very good movie in the same ""genre"". This ""genre"" of movies I tend to call ""High School"" movies will 90% of the time never do super great. There are some examples like The Breakfast Club, Project X,... etc. who did very well. But I couldn't count them on one hand. So that's something I like to keep in mind as well.I put these kind of movies all under the same umbrella but just to be specific this was clearly a more drama/romantic one of its kind. So.... All in all, I've seen way worse than this.The acting was good, during the more emotional scenes I didn't feel like there wasn't any unintentional weirdness or awkwardness or anything like that. The lead roles were well casted, I read some people found Elle annoying...? I disagree but oh well. People oversee that these actors are young in a very hard industry. They're not gonna win oscars straight from the bat. They all have to start somewhere.---- SPOILERS START HERE ---- ---- SPOILERS START HERE ----Now as for the story, as per usual in these kind of movies stated above. Same old, same old. Two very best friends, undividable. Along comes the most popular dude from the school.. Happens to be her best friends brother and there you have it. Which is FINE. You don't watch this movie and expect something else. At least.. I don't? But to be fair, there were quite some things that actually didn't make it that mainstream and made it tad bit different from those other movies which I liked.I agree with a lot of people about the potential message it could send to younger girls though. It's all meant well, love this that, blabla. But there were some moments I didn't like where I also thought, hmm... that's a bit aggresive or unusual for this kind of movie. I just hope younger girls who watch it don't realise it. So that makes me think they tried to aim a bit higher when it comes to age category. (Not that it's vulgar, lewd,...)Overall, an okay movie for THIS KIND. But will obviously never get an oscar, which probably isn't the makers their intention.. o/",The Kissing Booth

588,michiel-21443,Such a cliché,1,30 May 2018,"Every self-respecting human being, alive, shouldn't watch this movie, it's a waste of time. The acting is awful, even for a teenage romance movie. Almost every character is irritating and doesn't have any kind of personality. The storyline is such a cliché: a good girl (who tries way too hard to be cool) falls in love with a 'bad' guy, who turns out to be a good guy (wow, never have seen that before..). I can't even find the right words to explain how bad this movie is.
Just. Don't. Watch. It.Oh, and why the hell does Joey King have an acting career?",The Kissing Booth
589,pcbeta,"Stop romanticizing psychological issues (e.g jealous fit of rage, yelling coz scared of losing blah blah) and mental immaturity",4,31 May 2018,"First off, the only acting I was absolutely blown by was of Joel (Lee Flynn, best friend of Elle Evans). Everyone else's did not strike me as outstanding and awestruck-worthy. 
Anyways, so the story-i can't remember the chronological scenes but I'll try to recall each time I called out a disputable scene while watching it (I would love to review it as perfectly as I could but that would mean rewatching and I'm seriously etching this experience into my head atm so as to not stumble upon it 10 or 15 yrs later and mistake this as a watchable thing).
Okay so it did start that Lee and Elle were the perfect best friends who has these sets of rules including that any relative of said best friend would be off-limits, ridiculous but anyways, but the thing is Elle was harboring a massive crush on Noah, Lee's brother.
So about that time she wore a super short skirt, I'm like ""girl, u KNOW it was super short wth are you doing walking around without like cycling shorts atleast?!"" I was completely baffled by that, she just went out with just underwear???? What? Ridiculous in and of itself. And then she went to school and a guy (Tuppen?) slapped her behind. After that, said guy is in the same class with her and asked for her number, so ok neutral evil but stiiiill she laughed with him like they were so totally BFFs all of a sudden (???), then he did what she asked him to do just to get her number, *eyeroll* ""dude touched your lady bump. It was totally disrespectful, it's a pattern of behaviour not a 'mistake'"". That's not the worst yet 'cause she AGREED to go on date with the guy (GIRL???). Chaotic evil. But move one from that, she found out from the Tuppen(?) that Noah is barricading her from other guys (a little note to guys like him, LET HER FEEL SHE'S LOVED, MAN, SHE FREAKING DESERVE THAT, SHE DESERVES APPRECIATION ESP WHEN YOU OBV CANT SHOW ANY OF THOSE PROPERLY TO HER). Tada, manipulation and insecurity at it's finest, easy. Period.
Then there's the scene where she's too drunk she strips and, get this, her BEST FRIEND just watches her (??!!!!!) HE COULD'VE STOPPED THAT, doesn't have to happen. Buuut, move on.
Then there was that time at the cr where she accidentally entered a men's cr, Noah tried to drag her out, she resisted, 'mistaking' it for a manipulative motive and ended up stripping, again, inside the cr and dancing without a shirt on. First of all, it is impossible to not get sexually assaulted by that, poor behaviour right then and there. Second, that is not a good scene coz kids might think resistance ALWAYS stands for courage (I mean ok make mistakes, I mean that's where development blooms (which was not hinting that there was any in the movie) but at least explain that those kinds of poor behaviour are driven by a horrible character in itself. Again, not a good watch for teenagers, esp ones that look for ways to live through everything they see). Sometimes, courage means obedience, kiddozzz.
And then we go to that time where they kiss at a gazebo (the kissing booth scene was pretty perfect actually, if I watched that and only that I would be on my merry way) where he kissed her and said something that kind of hinted that he hoped that that kiss explained everything. A little note on that, IT DOESNT. Kissing will show her that you have sensual feelings for her but that's just about it. A little note for boys, sometimes kissing isn't the best thing you'll have to do, sometimes it's taking, like assuring them or explaining that you still haven't figured things out, atleast she'd know. Explain things! I don't care how much uncomfy you get by 'talking about stuff', we deserve it, we deserve clarifications, WE DESERVE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, not shallow waters that will suddenly go hundred feet below just 'coz you're 'afraid' of little 'talks', well then u do not deserve a real thing then, byyeee. Do not risk feelings when they're not yours, dummy, duh.
Then that time he shouted at her, personally I would be too scared, I would have cried. That is not a good thing (esp as it was dismissed as an ok kind of response, like how in the world???) to scream at women esp when it's not our fault. At the movie Elle was running away 'cause he was about to get into a fight and tackled a guy. He didn't even say sorry. But then well he explained later on that it was a psychological condition so let's not get on that 'cause movie is too emotion-based, or more like hook-up-based, to pay attention to ACTUAL details, like character development, selflessness, ACTUAL love, and many many many more.
And to cut it short, the airport scene, where he didn't look back bc she asked him not too, ofc being a girl, she thought he'd still do it but, again, her feelings are not the priority of this colossal asshole so he didn't do it. The she walked away from there saying ''that even if it did not work out with him, there's always going to be a part of me that will always belong to Noah...""*non-verbatim*. And just to clarify, it doesn't work like that, it never does. It will literally break your heart apart, again, writers, don't make ppl think that that's ok, that it's all 'worth it' just 'cause you got what you wanted at the moment that it's going to be fun and dandy in the future, and most ppl wish it never happened, it can be traumatizing when it doesn't work out. You gave your heart and virginity to that guy and some strong emotional attachment, it is 99-199% possible that it will wrench your heart if it never works out. Like what if Noah's not the right person and you meet the right person later in life, you can only wish that you waited cause most ppl have scars. It is never just a hook-up.And quick analyses:
The way Elle doesn't know how to protect herself (e.g cr scene, Tuppen incident) shows she is not readily capable of handling a relationship. She's bad at critical thinking. 
Noah is psychological not stable and is incapable of thinking of other ppl other than his own interests which reminds me that ""if he's nice to you but he's not nice to the waiter, then he's not a nice person"". He can't protect her properly but is willing to risk it all just to get her. Little, and actually unnecessary coz u should have known this, advice, fixing yourself first will lessen heartbreak esp for the other person. He's willing to do anything to protect his feelings to the point of preventing everyone to ask Elle out at the expense of her feelings.
Ok too much, but alsi it's just too much for me and nobody prolly won't ready half of this, sooo",The Kissing Booth

600,mir-26983,Decent Movie,6,18 June 2018,"The ""Kissing Booth"" was a really good movie with funny scenes. It was definitely done before with a cheesy storyline about the awkward girl falls in love with the jock, but the humour made up for it. I liked where it took place and how the characters were portrayed the main guy who was the popular one he wanted the awkward girl which was his brothers best friend and the girl all of a sudden catching feelings for the one guy she wasn't ""allowed"" to have which put her best friends relationship in jeopardy.It really just made the whole storyline more interesting since everything happened at once. The casting for the actors specifically the main was really good. Jacob Elordi did an amazing job he not only acted the part well , but definitely looked the part.The movie had some plot twists in the beginning , middle, and end. The unpredictable events made up for the stereotypical storyline making for a easy to watch movie. I personally don't enjoy watching movies because I get bored very easily , but the movie's plot seemed rush so I found it entertaining to watch it. The ""Kissing Booth"" was aesthetically pleasing to watch due to its setting. The colors, buildings, and scenery made for a good ""California"" theme.",The Kissing Booth

AND when noah is fixing her face scratch she says ""when did u become such a doctor"" BIH he just touched ur face w a wet towel !!! doctor??? where yo standards at hoe. and for the amount of times they showed that girl in a bra u would THINK they would at least get her a bra that didn't look like it came from the sale rack at aeropostale. btw if they invited a bunch of high schoolers to a costume party the best they would've gotten was a jock in a baseball jersey not a fully-dressed pirate from the actual pirates of the caribbean set. essentially this whole movie was a pile of hot garbage and i'm concerned for our generation if they sincerely enjoyed this movie and laughed with it instead of at it.",The Kissing Booth

632,jillyouldy,Good Message For Young Girls,7,28 January 2019,"SPOILER: Yes, at first glance the movie is just cute and light only. Elle and Noah are a classic girl and best friend's older brother couple, not unusual and not too sappy. But here's the real triumph: Noah is an alpha male and has a lot of love in him - before they're even official. He adores her and expects her to be protected by him. We already know he cares when he tells her not to go to parties, takes ownership and gets into fights over her. So romantic! There is one scene in particular where he fights someone over Elle's honor and then he is visibly upset. This is a good relationship for young girls and good to feel wanted and loved. How many men care enough like he does? We should carefully consider how our current media affects young minds in the formative stages where every film has too-cool-to-be-in-love-kids. Not here. I want more kisses!! number two please.",The Kissing Booth
633,maziarncr,I loved it,10,31 January 2019,"The kissing booth is an American romantic comedy movie which was directed by Vince Marcello. The film is based on a novel with the same name written by Beth Reekles. It was released on 11 May 2018. Although it is an American movie but it was filmed in South Africa and just some parts were shot in LA.
The movie is about 2 best friends (Elle and Lee) who were born in the same hospital in one day and now they have a really strong friendship and they even have some rules about their friendship that they promise to follow and shouldn't break. Lee has an elder brother named (Noah) and they all go to the same school. Noah has to protect Elle as a younger sister but actually Elle has a crush on him since she was a child. Noah is such a handsome man and all the girls literally die for him and he is always surrounded by girls and Elle is jealous of that. Elle and Lee create a kissing booth and all start from then. Elle and Noah finally fall in love with each other but they try to hide it from all people and their friends especially Lee. But unfortunately that doesn't work and Lee finally find out that they're in a relationship. He gets upset because Elle break one of their own rules. They don't talk to each other for a long time and Elle is also very sad about this situation because she doesn't want to lose her best friend so she decided to break up with Noah. A few days later in their birthday party Elle was very sad because she knew that Noah in gonna leave them for college so she wants to leave the party and find Noah, she tells Lee how she really feel about Noah. She says that she loves him but she also loves Noah so if he can't accept it then maybe they shouldn't be friend anymore.
Finally he accepted and decided to help her to find him. They got on a car and she started sharing her true feelings about Noah but suddenly she realized that it was Noah in Lee's costume.
During the next week they spend a lot of time together before he leaves for college. Elle goes with him to the airport and then they say goodbye to each other and he leaves. On the way of home she thinks about Noah a lot and says a part of my heart will always be with Noah and all of this just happen because of a kissing booth.
I really recommend this movie because it has learned me to take the things easy and then you understand that everything happens for a reason so don't worry about the hard things happen in your life because everything is gonna be ok.",The Kissing Booth

What is with women loving only beefcakes?Oh well, at least he is genuinely interested in her and really cares and checking out her wiles we know why.
A film to watch as a family one evening and forget about.",The Kissing Booth
