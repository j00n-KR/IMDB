0,Leofwine_draca,Passably enjoyable,6,6 January 2021,"PENINSULA is a slightly absurd and awkward TRAIN TO BUSAN sequel that forgets the action-horror premise of the original and instead becomes a post-apocalyptic chase flick and a riff on the likes of MAD MAX 2 and ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK. We're in a new world here, one filled with the usual Korean film quirkiness, oddball characterisation, overwhelming melodrama and lots and lots of action. The zombies, while regularly present, play second fiddle to the humans in the story, of whom there are plenty and in plentiful conflict. I'd heard a lot of bad things about this and it certainly is an unwieldy film at times, a far cry from the excellence of TRAIN TO BUSAN, but still passably enjoyable as a popcorn action flick.",Peninsula
1,SnoopyStyle,disappointing sequel,5,7 December 2020,"Korean soldier Captain Jung-Seok loses his sister and nephew on the boat to Hong Kong. It's four years later. The zombie infection is isolated on the quarantined Korean Peninsula. Jung-Seok and his brother-in-law Chul-Min are refugees. They and two other Korean refugees are recruited by the Chinese mob to go back to Korea and retrieve $20 million.Boat to Hong Kong would have been vastly superior. Obviously, the filmmaker wants to go bigger in the sequel. Only the bigger he gets it, the less compelling it becomes. The most compelling scenes are leaving that family behind at the start and the sister holding her son on the boat. That's it. The rest is a muddled mess. The thunder-dome is silly and only reduces the premise into B-sci fi territories. Then there is the zombie car chase. It's fun for awhile but ultimately, it's a videogame. The action reminds me of Ready Player One in a bad way. The last bits are where the movie falters in the pass/fail decision. The bad guys don't need to bring their big boat into the dock. Launch a couple of dinghies and land anywhere. As for the mother rescue, the movie runs on too long and it's too melodramatic. Let her have her heroic sacrifice moment and be done with it. I hate to say it but this is disappointing.",Peninsula
2,claudio_carvalho,Entertaining Sequel,7,2 July 2021,"After the zombie outbreak in South Korea, Captain Jung Seok (Dong-won Gang) heads with his sister, her husband and their daughter to a vessel that will transport survivors to Japan. While sailing, an infected man attacks a group of survivors, killing them including Jung Seok's sister and nephew and the ship changes her course to Hong-Kong. South Korea is quarantined by the other countries to contain the outbreak.Four years later Jung Seok and his brother-in-law Chul-min (Do-yoon Kim) are broken and outcast in Hong-Kong and South Korea is completely isolated. One day, they are contacted and invited to join a four-man team to retrieve a truck with US$ 20,000,000.00 in a place called Peninsula in the former North Korea. The mobster would transport the team to the Incheon Port during the night and they would bring the truck before the morning; in return, they would receive half of the money. However, they stumble upon a militia and the simple operation becomes a nightmare and only Jung Seok and Chul-min survive to an accident. How can they return to the ship that is waiting for them?""Bando "", a.k.a. ""Peninsula"", is not exactly a sequel of excellent and tense ""Train to Busan"". The idea of Korea quarantined by other countries to contain the outbreak of the first film is the only connection with the original movie. The plot is indeed an action post-apocalyptic film with zombies and highly entertaining. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Invasão Zumbi 2: Península"" (""Zombie Invasion 2: Peninsula"")",Peninsula
3,nogodnomasters,Zombies don't need gold or money,7,4 December 2020,"Four years after the zombie outbreak in Korea, a group of four survivors living in Hong Kong agree to go back and slip in at night time and recover a truck filled with money. They will drive the truck to Icheon Port where a boat will be waiting for them. What they discover is there are survivors in the peninsula and they all want off. There is a militia group that goes on raids and the film ends up as Fast and Furious with zombies. I enjoyed it even if no one else did and even got misty eyed at the ending.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.",Peninsula
4,kosmasp,Different beast,7,12 October 2020,"While it is marketed as Train to Busan 2 and generally the promotion, I reckon especially internationally, tries to enamour people to watch this, it does a bit of a disservice to the movie. Yes this is losely connected to Train to Busan, as it plays years after that event (mostly). But it is not the same movie and it does not pander and just rehashes what the first one was. This is more of an action adventure with zombies. And some pathos and (melo)drama thrown in for good (or bad) measure.Not everything is great here of course and if you'd ask me which of the two movies I liked better, I'd go with the first one. Still and even though this has its flaws, it is more than entertaining. If you let yourself enjoy it and don't compare it too much or let some drama ruin it. Especially the ending may really make some people at least annoyed. Predictable as it is, it looks and sounds good and is the zombie ride anyone who doesn't mind some explicit gun violence on their screens.",Peninsula
5,BA_Harrison,Train to Busan beyond Thunderdome.,6,2 June 2021,"Peninsula, the 2020 follow-up to the excellent Korean blockbuster Train to Busan, brings to mind Zack Snyder's more recent Netflix effort Army of the Dead, both films revolving around a mission to retrieve a vast sum of money from a city infested by zombies. Peninsula isn't anywhere as good as Train to Busan, but it's still superior to Snyder's bloated mess of a movie.Set four years after the first film, this sequel sees a team of desperate Korean refugees hired by Hong Kong criminals to recover $20m from a truck abandoned on the quarantined Korean peninsula. When they arrive, they discover that zombies are not the only threat: the city is also home to a rogue military unit who prey on other survivors, pitting their prisoners against the living dead for entertainment.The majority of Peninsula centres on the human threat, relegating the undead to a supporting role, the film feeling more like a Mad Max-style post-apocalyptic movie than a traditional zombie flick. This fact seems to have irked many fans of the first movie, but I quite enjoyed the new approach. However, I do agree with this film's detractors who complain that too much of the film relies on sub-standard CGI action that make parts of the film feel like a computer game: I'm sure a digitally rendered car chase is easier to produce than the real deal, and a CGI zombie horde is cheaper than hiring and making up extras, but it looks terrible and pulls the viewer out of the film.I also didn't like certain aspects of the final act: is it ever a good idea to lay down your guns when a villain holds someone hostage? And did we really have to have the happy happy joy joy wimp-out ending when the downbeat option would have been much more powerful?Still, even with the video-game action scenes and the Hollywood happy ending, this kicks Snyder's film to the ground and tears its throat out. 5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.",Peninsula
6,paul_haakonsen,"Adequate enough, but didn't live up to the expectations...",6,25 August 2020,"I really enjoyed the 2016 ""Train to Busan"" (aka ""Busanhaeng"") and so I was really excited when they announced that they were making a sequel, and I was anxiously awaiting to get to see it.Now came the time that I got to sit down and watch ""Peninsula"" (aka ""Train to Busan 2""). And I must admit that I am left here with a sensation of 'was that really it?'. This movie was lacking the intensity, excitement and entertainment value that the first movie had. Now, don't get me wrong, I am not saying that ""Peninsula"" is a bad movie. No. No. It just wasn't as good as the previous movie.The storyline in the movie was adequate, although it was bordering on being a bit too far stretched and out there. I mean, set four years after the events that took place in ""Train to Busan"", you'd think that writers Sang-ho Yeon and Ryu Yong-jae would come up with a more plausible storyline than what they. Sure, the movie was watchable, but the storyline was weak. And the movie also suffered from being very generic and predictable.The characters in the movie were adequate, and they definitely had a good ensemble of casted actors and actresses to perform in the movie. Just a shame that they were sort of held back by a lack of proper storyline and script.The special effects in the movie were good, but not great. I mean, four years after the epidemic outbreak, and the zombies milling about were still just dirtied up people in tattered and dirty clothes, with bloody mouths? Come on. The movie was lacking gore and mayhem. Where were the zombies with the traumas, the ghastly wounds, the missing limbs? They were simply nowhere to be seen, and that was something that took away a great deal of enjoyment from the movie. It just didn't come off as being what you would expect.""Peninsula"" is a bit too much focused on cars, driving and chases, where it started to feel like writers Sang-ho Yeon and Ryu Yong-jae were trying to mix the ""Fast and Furious"" movies into the zombie movies. I am sure that someone out there enjoys that. I found it fun at first, but the numerous car scenes quickly wore down and became too much.I must say that I was disappointed with what this 2020 sequel turns out to be. Sure, if you haven't seen the 2016 ""Train to Busan"" movie then you'll enjoy ""Peninsula"" a whole lot more. But if you, like me, have seen that predecessor and were looking forward to the sequel, then chances are that you will be sort of disappointed and disillusioned.My rating of ""Peninsula"" is a six out of ten stars. While it is a zombie movie, it just doesn't have that particular outstanding zombie movie atmosphere and feel to it.",Peninsula
7,searchanddestroy-1,Why offering a star to this crap?,1,16 July 2021,"Yes, why, why? I still wonder, but after all, I have no choice. But anyway, NEVER NEVER compare this pure junk to the original, the terrific LAST TRAIN TO BUSAN, the first movie which this garbage is supposed to be inspired from. Never. This one looks like an American Hollywood sh... for big silly and dumb audiences eating pop corn, always expecting f...happy endings and foreseeable schemes and characters. I was so bored during the watching of this crap, that I used the fast forward button, to shorten my torture and the end confirmed my worst fears. I lost my time. Yes, I lost my time. Run away from it, faster as it was a bunch of zombies on rampage after you.",Peninsula
8,bombersflyup,Generic sequel.,4,30 August 2020,"Peninsula is a disappointing sequel to the wonderful original.It's not intense or immersive, the zombies are hardly feared, yet it's not funny either. The girl's driving around like she's playing ""Burnout,"" with elements of ""I Am Legend"" in there. The original was non-stop peril, this has a story and downtime, none of which good. The ending's overly drawn out as well.",Peninsula
9,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Impressive and enjoyable sequel,9,13 September 2020,"With the virus still rampant in South Korea, a soldier who several years earlier escaped the country is asked to return with several others to look for a lost fortune, but when he finds a deadly group of survivors living in the area holding his team for participants in zombie games he races to save them.Overall, this one is every bit as enjoyable as the original. Most of the films' positives come from the stellar mixture of heart and action which was so prominent in the first film. The introduction to this early on with the soldier twice forced to make harsh decisions that seal the fate of various people that are deserving of help but the decision not to risk the health of the people he's around which forces him to leave them behind to die. Knowing that both situations involve a child during the apocalypse which is automatically triggering while the devastating emotional result of those scenes is quite familiar which allows them to resonate quite well. The setup we get with the family and their grandfather while he recuperates offers up some heartwarming moments as well with all the time we spend getting to know their dynamics and getting an idea about their future outcome. In addition to the heart and soul, the action here is incredibly fun. The zombie attacks are just as ferocious and vicious as before, bending and contorting themselves and running after their prey at high speeds. Leaping over barricades or other protective measures meant to keep them out, the athleticism and daring abilities they originally demonstrated is still employed here which is not only still terrifying but adds a nice bit of continuity to tie the films together. The group mentality they display by just overwhelming and swarming victims who tear them to pieces, as a result, offers plenty to like here as the scenes of the zombies attacking on the boat or overwhelming the rescue truck for survivors shows off their deadliness in fine form as well as letting some nice action-packed attacks come to the forefront. This one also manages to score nicely with other bits of high-energy stunt-work. After being rescued by the survivor and her daughter, the resulting series of car chases through the city causing plenty of vehicular stunts, crashes and impressive manners of crashing into the zombies to get by them. Even the tactics of using remote-controlled cars with lights and sound-makers attached for diversions make for some creative sequences as well, adding some variety to the scenes instead of just rushing into the swarm at high-speeds and sending them flying. There's also a nice bit involving the capture of one of his team members who's forced to participate in a fight-club of sorts against captured zombies with other prisoners in front of the gang as a form of amusement. The finale, featuring a slew of car-chases and gun-fights both on foot and inside the racing cars trying to escape the zombie-swarmed streets contains all sorts of high-energy action with all sorts of stunts and impressive action with the zombies getting taken out while the humans carry on their struggles. All that said, the film does have some minor problems. The CGI here is woeful and underwhelming, looking obvious whenever it occurs with the hilarity of the zombies flying through the screen after being wrecked by cars in their impact scenes, and it has a few minor subplots that don't need to be there as they just make the film longer than necessary. Otherwise, the film is quite enjoyable with a lot to like.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",Peninsula
10,phd_travel,"Good start, soso middle, satisfying ending",7,5 September 2020,"If you compare this movie to the original it will feel less unique and may seem more deja vu. Of course it's a a chase movie with zombies. In that sense it has a Terminator feel. Things start off with an interesting premise - go back to get the cash since Zombies don't want money. Some faults. One thing I didn't like was the game where they fed humans to the zombies. Unnecessary. Also making them fight other bad humans was irritating. A lot of the movie is at night.
The good points are the ending wasn't irritating. No one likes too much self sacrifice. Kang Dong Won looks quite suitable in this role surprisingly. In the past he seemed not quite hero looking for action but here he is good. Lee Jung Hyun is quite a good heroine too.
Okay for what it is. More conventional and less unique than the first movie. I prefer #Alive. But still an entertaining enough watch.",Peninsula
11,siderite,"Typical zombie flick, with some nice action scenes, but unrelated to Train to Busan",6,6 September 2020,"If this film would have been a standalone action movie, I would have rated it average, maybe above that. However it was marketed as the sequel to Train to Busan, which was very well done not only on the technical level, but also the personal one. Characters were complex, dialogues well written and the zombies, as in any good sci-fi story, were just the setting.Now here comes this production, which is more like a video game from the Resident Evil franchise, without the cool monsters and special effects. And while it has its good parts, a third of it should have been cut in editing and the money used on decent CGI. Compared to Train to Busan, it sucks! And that's kind of weird, as the same team did both movies.Bottom line: no matter how many enthusiasts want to play zombies in film, you need to have a better story for the movie to be good. This wasn't it.",Peninsula
12,FeastMode,mad max meets korean zombie flick?,4,17 July 2021,"The opening scene is great. I wasn't super into for the next hour-ish when it seems like a typical post-apocalyptic movie. Then it becomes super intense and fast-paced. Then it becomes super fake. Then it becomes super cringe-y.It sucks cause near the end of the movie, i was entertained and thought i might give it a positive score of 6 stars if it had a solid finish. But it took a quick nose-dive in the last 20-ish minutes.The car chase scenes look so fake. It's very noticeable. And not in the usual way with them looking cartoony. But the movements don't look natural at all. Turns, bumps, crashes, etc. It really took me out of the movie.And on top of that, they straight up copies stuff from mad max - fury road. A couple of shots are identical. All that does is remind me how much worse this action is than my 2nd favorite all-time movie.And man, the cheesiness. It was hard to take. There are so many parts i found really stupid, most of it in the last 20 minutes. Stuff that doesn't make sense, really dumb character decisions, and some bafflingly bad dialogue/line delivery (of course mostly by the english-speaking characters). Seriously, a couple of the lines would be on an all-time worst movie lines ranking, if that existed.I did like some of the creative ideas for this post-apocalypse. And it had some good action. But even if it finished strong and pulled off a 6-star rating, it would still be a throw-away entertaining movie. Not like the original which i thought was such a cool entry into the zombie genre (1 viewing, 7/16/2021)",Peninsula
13,851222,Has nothing to do with the original. And a bad movie overall,4,19 September 2021,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Train to Busan Presents: Peninsula"" (2020) just might be one of the worst sequels that i have ever seen. Thankfully, plot wise this movie had nothing in common with an excellent ""Train to Busan"" (2016). Actually, it had nothing in common in every possible way, because first film was amazing, and this was amazingly bad.The CGI of car chase sequences were among the worst ever made. Why did they even attempted to do it if they clearly lacked a needed budget or technology. Even on some rally games on PS4 car look 10 times more real than this movie have portrait them, i mean what??The other thing is that when you see some 13 years old girl driving car trough a collapsed cities ruins and smashing zombies better then Dominic Torreto in latest ""Fast and Furious"" series, you know there is something fundamentally wrong with a movie.This movie failed with characters - i couldn't care less about any of them, including main characters. Villains were also as generic and boring as they get. There were some references to ""Mad Max"" movies and ""Word War Z"", but they failed to rip even those.Overall, the first 15 min. Of ""Train to Busan Presents: Peninsula"" were kinda pretty OK, but the movie started collapsing very soon. The ending tried to be touching but instead all i could see were two young girls acting out as they can and crying more then human eyes could possibly produce tears - it was way over the top.To summarize, skip this movie even if you liked the first one - it has nothing to do with the first movie. And that is kinda a good thing that great original could not be damaged by this bad film.",Peninsula
14,westsideschl,Surprisingly Good,9,25 January 2021,"Surprisingly good even for the overcooked zombie genre. Zombies were numerous; nicely cosmetically zombized with well chosen stunt zombies for expressions & contortions. Additional fight scenes between boring humans added spice to zombie meal. Car chase & zombie mowing added a nice flavorful topping to this movie meal. A few plot twists to keep us guessing. All with some, perhaps humorously, unlikely characterizations. CGI not the best, but good enough unless you're a picky eater.",Peninsula

16,paulclaassen,Oh NO...!!,3,29 August 2020,"Although I'm generally not in favor of sequels, I was really looking forward to this 'Train to Busan' sequel. Unfortunately, 'Peninsula' is not what I was hoping for.Where do I even begin with how disappointed I am with this film? Firstly, the most obvious: the CGI. Oh, my goodness, the CGI is so bad, and its all over the place. It looked as if the entire film was shot in a studio, with everything else being added in post-production. Of the many car chase scenes in the film, not a single scene utilized practical effects. Instead, they opted for (terrible!) CGI. The film therefore lost every inch of realism, ultimately looking like a video game. (I do hope this is not the future of film making...)Secondly, the premise and the characters. Someone watched way too many American films and attempted to make a Korean film Hollywood style, with cliched annoying characters and situations. In fact, the characters were so uninteresting that I didn't care about any of them (no, not even the lead), and I actually found myself hitting the forward button when some of these annoying characters were on screen. There are also way too many comedic moments that completely ruins the suspense of the film. Come to think of it, there were no suspense whatsoever...Thirdly, the zombies. This is supposed to be a zombie film, yet the zombies are merely along for the ride - a sideshow, if you will. The film is slow moving with very little revolving around the zombies. 'Peninsula' is essentially a crime thriller, with zombies thrown in the mix. There's so little originality here (almost everything is copied from American crime films we've seen over the years). The film also lacks emotional depth, which was so prominent and effective in 'Train to Busan'. They did attempt emotion towards the end, but since I didn't care about the characters, it didn't matter and I was sitting there thinking ""oh, just get on with it..."".I tried enjoying this as a standalone film, but alas, there was little here I enjoyed. The CGI and lack of practical effects - when it easily could have been used - completely ruined the film, as if the premise itself wasn't enough cause to raise an eyebrow or two...",Peninsula
17,cruise01,Weak sequel but action packed.,6,25 November 2020,3 out of 5 stars.Peninsula is a fair action horror film that is weaker to the first film. Which packed on intense thrills for a zombie thriller. Peninsula fails to pack on the thrills. It has more action. About a survivor going back to the quarantined infected city. To find a truck that has loads of money in it. When there. They come across bad guys who are having gladiatorial games with zombies.Lacking in scares. Lots of shoot em up action that is somewhat entertaining. Decent characters. Fair plot. And cheesy cgi car chases. Every car chase cgi is terribly put together. The climax being like mad max with zombies. And being anticlimatic.,Peninsula

19,Fella_shibby,"They shud have focused more on the rat king zombies. Nevertheless, a fast paced action film.",7,25 August 2020,"Did i say action n not zombies?
So as a stand alone, it is a good action film but nowhere close to Train to Busan in terms of zombie stuff.
The story takes place four years after the events of part one. A guilt ridden Korean soldier now living as a refugee in Hongkong is sent along with four fellas to retrieve a truck full of money from the quarantined Korea now inhabited by zombies.
Comparison to Mad Max, Doomsday, Fast n Furious will crop up everywhere. But the point is, is it entertaining? O yeah! Tons of car chase n gun action sequences. Fans of Train to Busan like me will b disappointed.
The social commentary, the emotions, the characters n most importantly the zombie stuff is missing here.
The climax scene in slow mo with melodrama gets on ur nerves. Watch out for the UN's major Jane. Her dialogue delivery n the way she runs is hilarious.

We obviously loved the first one and looked forward to the sequel. The sequel is very much post the first movie and a completely new storyline of how the world has adjusted to life post zombie apocalypse. Obviously resources are scarce and hot zone and safe zones have been established and enforced by the United Nations. The story is about a group sent into a hot zone to retrieve a lost truck of money and everything, of course, goes haywire. There's a lot going on in this movie (1 hour and 52 minute runtime) for me to get deep into it, but my cliff notes is the zombies are like World War Z, the villains are like Mad Max's villains, and the heroes are kind of like fast and furious. If you could somehow combine those 3 things into a movie, you'd get Penninsula. Jaz and I really enjoyed this film. She gave it an 8/10 and felt it was as good as the first one. I'd say it's a 7/10.

22,stevendbeard,Action Packed Roller-Coaster Ride,8,12 September 2020,"I saw ""Train to Busan Presents:Peninsula"" starring Dong_Won Gang-Golden Slumber, The Secret Reunion; Jung_Hyun Lee-Alice in Earnestland, A Petal Girl; Min_Jae Kim-The Truth Beneath, A Girl at My Door and Re Lee-A Melody to Remember, How to Steal a Dog.
This is a sequel to the 2016 Train to Busan, with both being filmed in South Korea-with Korean actors-and both about a zombie apocalypse. And they are both in Korean with English sub titles-at least the ones I saw were. This one takes place about 4 years after the first movie and no, none of the survivors from the first movie are in this one. Dong plays a soldier that escaped to Hong Kong after the first infection hit. Some gangster type felons want him to go back into the zombie occupied area to retrieve a truck loaded with lots of cash that was left in the hasty evacuation-Dong has been there and knows his way around-and they promise him a hefty cut of the money. When he goes back in, he crosses paths with Jung, Min & Re, some of which are helpful and some are not-It seems that there are some survivors inside the area, both good and bad. It's an action packed rollercoaster ride of fast car chases-which reminded me of the Mad Max and Escape From New York movies-and zombie fighting, and these are the fast moving zombies, not the slow ones. Now, I must admit that some of the action is a little unbelievable-they must really make strong cars and trucks in Korea-but this isn't a documentary, it's a zombie movie. If you like zombie movies, you should enjoy this one-and if you haven't seen the first one, you should check it out.
It's not rated but it contains action, violence and some language and has a running time of 1 hour & 56 minutes.
I really liked it and would buy it on Blu_Ray.",Peninsula

24,kluseba,A breathtaking dystopian action epic that doesn't have much to do with its predecessor,8,9 December 2020,"Peninsula is the sequel to groundbreaking Korean horror movie Train to Busan that is one of my favourite genre movies of all time. It's important to understand that these two movies are quite different however. Train to Busan is a horror movie with action and drama elements that follows a group of sympathetic characters escaping their worst nightmare. This sequel is a dystopian action movie that shows a group of reckless survivors fighting for a better future.This movie starts on a rather low note but gets progressively better. The scenes showing Korean refugees living in Hongkong are rather stereotypical involving predictable themes such as racism and criminality. The plot is quite thin as well as a group of survivors is asked to return to Korea to find a truck filled with bags of money. The lead characters have an acceptable background story but are certainly lacking the charisma of the characters in the original film.This film however improves as soon as the events in Incheon unfold. The atmosphere is gloomy right from the start. The settings make think of dystopian science-fiction movies. The three factions in this movie are quite intriguing. You have the group of mercenaries who are trying to retrieve the money for a criminal syndicate. There is a family consisting of a delusional grandfather, a fierce mother, an ambitious teenage daughter and a quirky girl who are trying to find a way to call for help and get off the doomed peninsula. Finally, a group of former military personnel suffering from menacing rivalries is raiding the abandoned city and kidnapping survivors in order to let them fight against zombies in an underground arena while placing bets on the outcome. The movie shows how these three factions clash and try to survive. The characters are slowly becoming more likeable or dislikeable and especially the family members are quite intriguing. The highlight of the movie is a long car chase sequence in the final third that is so breathtaking that the exaggerated special effects actually manage to blend in very appropriately.In the end, Peninsula is an intense dystopian action movie that takes about half an hour to unfold but delivers the goods throughout the tense middle section and the breathtaking finale. Most people who wrote negative reviews were disappointed by the fact that this film didn't have much in common with the excellent predecessor other than the fact that the Korean peninsula has been overrun by zombies. Once you are willing to accept that you must expect two completely different movies, you should be able to appreciate Peninsula as gloomy science-fiction action spectacle that benefits from its massive budget.",Peninsula

27,s3276169,Train wreck......,5,26 August 2020,"I felt a genuine sense of dislocation between the first film and its sequel.The treatment is entirely different and not in a good way. The first film presented a gritty apocalyptic world, that in spite of the zombie like material, managed to sustain a sombre sense of realism.By contrast, the sequel feels more like a larger than life cyberpunk, action fantasy mash up. It clumsily mixes elements reminiscent of cheesy, chincy Hollywood blockbusters, with inexplicable fantasy action sequences, married up to a Mad Max styled, cyber punk post outbreak landscape.Replete with bizarre race car driver girls, a strange little kid character with remote controlled cars, feral gangs, un-dead hordes and zombie death arena's.Its jarring, discordant stuff, that hops around like a barefoot beach goer on hot summer sand. I had a hard time seeing this through to the end and wont be watching any further films if they are anything like this train wreck.I'm giving this one a 5/10 largely because the acting is mostly solid, action such as it is is polished as are cinematic's . That said, so much else is off, that's as much as I can offer.",Peninsula

29,Reviews_of_the_Dead,"Big Shoes to Fill, but Brings Interesting Commentary, Action, Zombies and Heart",8,8 September 2020,"Now this was a movie I wasn't entirely sure how it was going to work out. I really liked Train to Busan and didn't really know where you could take it for a sequel. Regardless, it was the second movie I've seen since the theaters have opened during the COVID pandemic that we're still experiencing at the time of writing this. The synopsis is a soldier and his team battle hordes of post-apocalyptic zombies in the wastelands of the Korean peninsula.We start this movie off right at the beginning of the infection. We're with Jung Seok (Dong-Won Gang) as he's with his family. They're trying to flee to a ship that will allow them to escape this nightmare. With him is his brother-in-law, his sister and their son. The route they're taken goes through a wooded area. They pass car wrecks and one that includes Min Jung (Jung-hyun Lee) and her family. They don't help them and just drive past.They boarded on to a large vessel for a sea voyage. Jung's sister is worried about how long they're on the water and that they should be to Japan by now. Jung goes to check and see the infection has made it on the ship. The Americans that are in charge do not want to reveal information, but tragedy strikes. Jung needs to make a tough decision that will not only affect his life, but his brother-in-law's as well.It then jumps 4 years into the future. The movie gives us an interesting way of progressing through reports on television and an interview. It is revealed that this infection started in a laboratory and got released. The movie speaks of a merging back to one Korea, but it happened before that which is suspect. The lower half of the peninsula is quarantined. Jung is struggling with what happened and those from South Korea are shunned by the people in Hong Kong. That is where they were relocated.An opportunity arises where a crime boss, Geoffrey Giuliano, wants 4 refugees from South Korea to go back and recover a large sum of money. There is a truck that has money in the back, but the driver stopped responding to messages. Jung has military training and he seems interested in going. The incentive is that they really have no rights here and the 2.5 million US dollars would allow them to make their own way. The plan is to recover the truck, call from a satellite phone and get out of there. They are given weapons and roughly where the truck was the last time they made contact.Things seem to without a hitch until we see they're not alone. We see there are two young girls watching them from a nearby building, but how are they surviving out here? There also seems to be a military unit as well and they're not so nice. There time isolated from the rest of society shows the breakdown of humanity. It becomes a fight for survival where the zombies might not be the worst things that are out here.That's where I want to leave my recap as I feel that gets everything up to speed for what you need to know where this story is going to take us. As I was stating in the opening paragraph for this, I really wondered where they were going to go for this sequel. I'm actually glad that it decided to put us with another group in the same world as that worked for me. On top of that, I like that since there's time between the original and now, they allowed the world to develop like it does and it really hits on some aspects of social commentary.Now as you all probably know, I'm from the United States, but this movie is really hitting on issues we see here. The first being that there's this conspiracy going around that COVID was developed in a lab and was released. I'm assuming this movie was made before all of that, but it is scary the parallel is drawing there, which this zombie virus was made in a lab. There is minority of conspiracy theory folks that also believe the Corona Virus was as well. Living in this pandemic is wild to see this movie as everyone has to quarantine from the infected to stay alive.The next point I wanted to hit is the fact that Jung, his brother-in-law and the other two survivors are refugees living in Hong Kong. They're looked down on because of what happened in South Korea, but again, living in the US there is a lot of talk about immigration. I had to unfriend people on social media as they were saying some extremely racist things about those from South, Central America and especially the Middle East. These people are struggling being displaced and it is much worse when those around you are alienating you as well.I don't really want to go to spoiler heavy for things that are happening back in South Korea for the characters, but this movie really hits a lot of points that you'd see in the original Dawn of the Dead. That's not to say they stole ideas as that is not the case. We are seeing the effects having power does to those that are stuck. Capt. Seo is pretty shady and he's working with Pvt. Kim (Gyo-hwan Koo). They have a sick game they're playing that reminded me of Land of the Dead, but better. This is used to placate the people and we're seeing corruption. There's also Sgt. Hwang (Min-Jae Kim) who is on the verge of a military coup and he has the power to pull it off. Just seeing what has happened as they've been isolated here for so long and the madness that comes with not only their situation, but power.Now if you've seen Train to Busan, something that movie did famously was tug at the heart strings of the audience. I won't spoil what happens there, but I was wondering if this movie was going to do that as well. It does a different take on it, this time with a mother and her children. I do appreciate that and I'm not going to lie, I was tearing up near the end again. I do think the impact is a little bit diminished, but I think it works with something we saw earlier in the movie for sure.Since this is a zombie movie, I really should talk about the effects next. They really do seem to go practical where ever they can. It seems like they got actors who were dancers or something to this effect as they have really good control over their body. I wouldn't be surprised if there was some use of wires as well. We do get the zombies being a bit superhuman at times, but not enough for me to gripe as I know this is something we see with martial arts films from Asia. There is also CGI, but to be honest, I think what they do with it is solid for the most part. I have some minor gripes, but I'm not going to nit-pick here. They also keep with the mythology of these zombies where they stop moving in the dark until they hear things. They also do run which goes along with how they move. The cinematography is well done also. There are some really good action sequences.I want to shift this over to the acting of this movie. I think that Gang does really well as our lead. When we first get introduced to him, he's a soldier and he's upholding his duty. He has a tough decision to make, choosing family over saving the lives of everyone on this ship. This eats away at him and I love seeing the effects it has. You can feel it and it works for where his character ends up. Lee is also solid in her role. I like her as she forces Jung to grow. Re Lee is Jooni. There's an interesting dynamic for her as well as her younger sister, Yu-Jin (Ye-Won Lee), where they've grown up in situation, so they don't know much aside from it. I would say that Kim along with the rest of the soldiers in this unit is solid as well. Seeing the effects of their world on them and how power can corrupt works. The rest of the cast including those playing zombies did well also.So now with that said, I didn't know what to expect coming in. I avoided the trailer and really learning anything about where they were going to take this. I would say that they did a really good job in keeping the feel of the first movie while giving us a new group of characters to follow. The acting really helps move this along with the effects of the movie. The social commentary we get really helped for me as well. Aside from that, the soundtrack fit for what was needed, but didn't necessarily stand out to me. I would rate this as a good movie. It falls short of the original, but that's a tough act to follow up. I will warn you, this is from South Korea. There is a bit of English in it, but it is mostly in Korean so there are subtitles. If that is a problem, avoid this. If not, I would say especially if you like running zombies, this is a good movie with its own mythology.",Peninsula
30,arungeorge13,"Nope, not a great sequel to Train To Busan! [+50%]",5,2 October 2020,"Expectations were pretty high when a sequel to the excellent Train To Busan was announced. The trailer promised a tonne of action - very Hollywood-like in its approach. I should have guessed; that wasn't a great sign of things to follow. Peninsula positions itself as a bigger yet messy straightforward action sequel. It lacks the emotional core that made the first film so endearing to viewers all over the globe. Peninsula boasts a larger set of characters, but none with a solid emotional payoff (yes, including the mother and the daughters). We also encounter a bunch of one-note psychopathic bad guys with little to no backstories.The set-pieces are a mixed bag. Most of it feels like a long cinematic sequence from a Need for Speed game with zombies in it. The excessive use of CGI is apparent and makes the action less credible and enjoyable. Some good work has gone into the production design - there's a stretch involving a vicious death match-styled battle between captured humans and zombies taking place in a shopping-mall-turned-arena. We also see abandoned vehicles on highways, a walkway filled with a zombie horde, disintegrating buildings, a wrecked port, and more that convey how the world has changed since the zombie outbreak.Director Yeon Sang-ho tries to recreate that teary climax from the original, but it feels cut from a totally different cloth (you'll know when you see it!). The English dialogues (and accents) felt out of place. Also, why all the exposition but no proper emotional arcs? For me, Peninsula was rather forgettable. As a big, nonsensical action movie, it's okay but as a sequel to Train To Busan, it's a letdown.",Peninsula
31,Abdulxoxo,Train to Busan presents: Trainwreck,5,11 October 2020,"As much as I feel the original Train to Busan is overrated, it is still far better this is standalone sequel. The big downfall of this movie is the over-reliance on CGi, the zombies, the car chase scenes, even the ghost city is CGi-based. This not only make it less enjoyable but also distracting. The post-apocalyptic setting is not bad but the problem is that, it's been done before and way better executed than in this movie. Even though we saw some backstory of our main characters, it's still hard to care about thema and it's obvious that they got plot armor which took out the suspense. The movie gets over-dramatic at sometimes eg The ending scene where the mother wants to kill herself, and then all of a sudden she decided not to, and then proceed to kill off the zombies. I mean, why didn't she do that in the beginning and save us the drama and that generic sad string score. This movie doesn't bother to be original, it just borrowed from other movies.",Peninsula
32,Prashast_Singh,Best action movie of the year. Hands down.,10,25 August 2020,"Before you watch this film, you must keep one thing in mind: Peninsula is not like Train to Busan in terms of plot. Both films had non-stop action and tension but Peninsula is done differently; the action involves guns and car chases while TTB featured raw hand-to-hand combat, baseball fights and foot chases. So while you might not find the tearjerker moments like TTB in Peninsula, the film's exciting action sequences and constant suspense make up for that and anything else missing. If you really want to watch it, forget it's even related to TTB in anyway.So let me tell you one more thing: this is more like a heist action movie than a zombie horror. For some reason, it feels like the film doesn't want to scare you, and it might not work for those willing to be scared. (FYI, the film in its native country has been described as an action-drama so I don't blame the makers for not focusing on the horror quotient enough) But, the film's tone is exciting with non-stop action from start to finish; I thought the car chase sequences were outstanding, and I wish I could get to see this in cinemas somehow. It's also good to see Gang Dong-won and Lee Jung-hyun in these intense action roles; I wish to see more of the two in future. Yeon Sang-ho has directed the film quite well and has handled the film's blockbuster elements nicely.I wish audience wasn't so critical; it's already hard to get a blockbuster scale action film in these harsh times and not everyone values that. So whether you like it or not is one thing, but that one thing can be affected if you decide what you want, before you begin to watch this film: an emotionally resonant action horror with some tearjerker moments or just a fun, explosive, blockbuster action thriller. If you want the second one, this is the right film to watch and you must wait no more.",Peninsula

From the trailer, I can already tell that this movie gonna be more bombastic with explosion and action than the last one yet I never thought that it gonna be this underwhelming. If you looking for an entertaining zombie movie then this movie is no doubt the best option right now when it features many well-shot action scenes with the best car chase scene I've ever seen in quite a long time but on the other hand, the human drama aspect that makes many people fall in love with the franchise in the first place was pretty weak. The main cast still likable for you to root for them but because the movie doesn't spend enough time to develop them as much as they can all the dramatic moments that meant to draw the audience's tears fall extremely flat.

39,kuarinofu,"Finally, a wacky kid-friendly zombie video-game cutscene comedy...thing we've all been waiting for",5,24 August 2020,"This film is like watching Home Alone with zombies while playing Dying Light and Zombie Driver HD. The first 50 and the last 20 minutes of the film even look like a video-game cutscene, since the sets are very distinguishable and it has that Star Wars prequels feel.
Thematically it is closer to Romero movies (people trying to outlive the zombie apocalypse) and probably to Shaun of the Dead, but the jokes are not funny and the fact that almost every actor in this tries to conjure Jared Leto's Joker is not helping out the situation. The visuals are just a mix of the I am Legend movie and Dying Light videogame scenery. The acting is super messed up and this is further made worse by the difference in the emotional acting of foreign films, like Korean and Japanese ones.
The film has nothing to do with the first one and all the connections were probably made afterward to boost marketing.
In terms of entertainment, after you get used to the weirder tones of the film, you will surely enjoy some of the action scenes (which are ok even with heavy CGI use) but not for long, since the ending consists mostly of Ready Player One race scenes with Colin McRae 16 y.o. girl doing physically impossible stunts.
The ending gets needlessly convoluted and surprisingly they don't even provide good tearjerker Korean drama moments which I kind of expected.
Overall, this is not a bad film, but it lacks the viewer's engagement due to the tone of the film, the predictability of the story, the disconnected acting, videogame CGI, and more. I liked Train to Busan a lot and I can safely say that I will be forgetting this film very fast.",Peninsula

41,msbreviews,PENINSULA is far from its predecessor's quality.,4,30 December 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Train to Busan is one of my favorite South Korean films ever, and I firmly defend that it's one of the best zombie apocalypse movies of all-time, maybe even the best. Therefore, I couldn't help but feel incredibly excited about another installment set in the same world. It's not a direct sequel to the original's story, but it seems to be placed just after the pandemic began. Unfortunately, it ends up being a huge disappointment.Despite the jaw-dropping stunt work and the extremely intense action sequences, the reason why Peninsula's predecessor works so well is due to its focus on the characters. By giving them a compelling development and a strong emotional bond, the zombie outbreak becomes instantly more effective because of our immense concern for everyone involved. Every technical element is dialed up to its maximum, transforming the film into an emotionally devastating, heart-wrenching story.Yeon Sang-ho tries to follow a shortcut to achieve that same emotion of his previous movie, dooming this ""sequel"" from the very beginning. Every relationship feels forced, and the supposedly heartbreaking decisions/events are a complete target miss. Even the action scenes fail to live up to the original's level due to excessive CGI in ridiculous car chases. Every fifteen minutes, a major logical issue arises, and some characters are either straight-up dumb or unbelievably smart for their age/experience. Peninsula takes the realistic environment established by Train to Busan and fictionalizes it way too much.Rating: C-",Peninsula
42,SoumikBanerjee25,Diminishes Its Predecessor's Reputation!,5,27 September 2020,"'Peninsula' turned into that very darned thing 'Train To Busan' averted at all costs.
A paradigmatic hollywood-ish execution that dwells heavily on its asthetics but forgot all the good its forebear has delivered in the past.Hollywood has successfully butchered its competition with this undesirable collaboration!
A clever move I must say.
What made 'Train To Busan' unrivaled was its different approach. Therefore, it propitiously generated immense popularity among people. So when the announcement about Peninsula came through; the excitement was evident. Albeit it's a pity what we get at the end.
A whopping setback.Forceful inclusion of painful English Accents, that were certainly unnecessary at the very first place. Lack of Emotional pull towards its half baked characters who failed to establish relevance. Too loud of a soundtrack that complimented only the high octane sequences; for the rest it didn't simply appeal. Performances are honest but an actor could only be as good as the writing they being given!Action pieces are impressive and on a bigger scale than before yet they appear oddly repetitive. This extravagant influence might woo some part of the audience, especially those who just wanna have some mindless fun! But for us who have seen & adored the previous film; this would be a rather forgetful event.In conclusion, I understand the director's intent of collabing with Hollywood.
He sort of grabbed this opportunity to spread his work on a global scale, ultimately reaching much more viewership and that's totally fine.
Due to a firm backing up, he managed to up his game in Visuals, the look & feel of the film. And that's truly commendable! I appreciate that. Had it been a standalone production; I would not have mind either.But the harsh reality is it's not. It could never stay away from its ever dominant prequel.

As a result, you get alot of throw away characters that are killed for ""entertainment"" juxtaposed with the notion that the real monsters are the greedy humans that have free choice & not in fact the zombies themselves that have one basic need that is to feed on the remaining humans.I deduced that the movie's name is chosen as a metaphor for the human race being slowly but surely corrupted & surrounded by a river of greed. Furthermore that human decency has eroded to the extent that is hard to find in this new world. This is a bleak movie that sensationalise the worst of humanity & shines the spotlight that decent people are becoming a dying breed in this dystopian world.

The director talked about this several times, probably to avoid comparisons. Peninsula is not as good as Train to Busan, yes, but it's also a totally different film that doesn't try to emulate the first. This is very common in zombies/infected genre but people look like are still surprised by that (Romero did totally different films each time; 28 Days and 28 Weeks Later are very different, and so on...). Train to Busan is pretty much a tense drama/horror film and this one is an action/horror film, a subgenre that some don't understand at all when associated with zombies, based on the reception for each one of those films.This is a clear homage to Mad Max saga and it would be great for that alone but it's also very interesting for his structure, with two separate stories/situations ending in the same place. Peninsula is packed with great action scenes and maybe has too many driving sequences (which removes the focus on the emotional side of the family drama), but in the end - with the support of a great job by most of the actors who can give us really good pieces of acting - is still a film much more about people and personal choices than zombies.",Peninsula

As for the specific storyline well it is the complete opposite to the originals, the protagonists are now armed to the teeth, which obviously gives way to explosions and bullets flying everywhere and subsequently no atmosphere to the film. The biggest disappointment is the SFX or whatever they are, I'm still not sure if they were SFX or actual animation, at best they were of video game quality.
On the whole it is better than most zombie tripe that appears but from the guy who brought us Train to Busan we want more, is it his fault solely? Well probably not. With the popularity of the original it is understanable for the studio to push for a sequel but this is clearly what happens when time constraints are pushed to keep the franchise within the audiences mind, you lose time to develop the actual story and why the original was so well made.",Peninsula

Sadly, everything in this movie, including characters, CGI and story, is inferior compared to the first film.

It was so unreal it was hard to believe. I loved how they did this movie and how it was miles away from the other one. They should have started off with this one first and then went to the other one, with a few changes. Again, with the bad guy getting away with a lot though I did not like how the director had my emotions all over the board. Oh and the mother is running to catch the plane at the end, but stops and has enough time to hug her children. Then somehow she is no longer being chased by zombies? Fake!

56,TwistedContent,"The Weak No-Personality Cousin of ""Train to Busan""",5,1 September 2020,"Quite a few disappointments have been welcomed lately, and reasonably much anticipated ""Peninsula"" joins the list, naturally. ""Train to Busan"" was a major hit back in the 2016, and remains in the top echelon of the modern zombie horror movies. Soon after out came news stating that a sequel is going to happen, so that's at least intriguing, based on the quality of the first film, and taking into account it's the same director. Well, it has arrived, and it is weak.""Peninsula"" takes place in the universe of ""Train to Busan"", 4 years after the events of the first movie. We follow Jung Seok, a soldier who made some mistakes in the past (intro), he now lives in Hong Kong, is broke, and gets involved in a money heist, which has them going to Korean Peninsula, where around wander zombies, ""Mad Max"" type fellas & those few other characters necessary for the resolution. After all that, ""Fast & Furious"" kicks into gear, and also every story cliché in the book. I mean, the entire plot of ""Peninsula"" actually amazes me, because, truly, it's entirely predictable, many times experienced, consists of overused characters/storylines/genre-tropes/gimmicks/etc., lacks any real character development, very visibly tries to play on sentimentalism and dramatism without much of anything behind it. It's hard to feel much for characters so paper thin. So story is, obviously, is not the main attraction. It's awful by comparison, how much better ""Train to Busan"" story was on an emotional level. ""Peninsula's"" main sell is action and violence, but sadly it wears on You, and not in a great way. Visually the movie looks more or less nice, cinematography and colors are pleasant enough. However, all of that is continuously ""disturbed"" by a multitude of action sequences, very plausibly consisting majorly from cgi. Crazy car chases that defy physics, logic, electronics and make me think how very little actual cars might've been used in the production of this movie. The problem is that everything looks unrealistic, too playful, and simply gives the impression of cutscenes in AAA games. Having said that, some of the action, like the kind that doesn't necessarily involve cars, entertains. Entertains and eventually fluctuates as well. So what's good-good? Not that it gives much, but acting, like always, is decent. But there is maybe one character that I could try to say I liked. Liked-liked. One character, that's very little. My point is, the actors did as much as their couple script pages allowed them.I see ""Peninsula"" as one of the 'painfully average' movies, built from a blueprint that hasn't felt like it has any depth for a long, long time. It's all just an honest bummer, especially once you try to compare it to its predecessor. A Korean zombie movie that entertains on the most basic of levels, really tries to look like an A, and feel-wise, would disappoint even in the B movie category. My rating: 5/10.",Peninsula

When I approached Peninsula, I thought that this was going to be a proper sequel, explaining what happens after the virus hit the world, instead I saw a group of random guys going back to the contaminated area for a suicide mission. A trivial plot.The movie has no soul, creators tried to copy Hollywood, by creating a really average movie that cannot stand out. All characters are very cliché and unmemorable, nothing to do with Seok-Woo or Sang-Hwa. CGI is kinda okay, but I cannot say that is good, it is clear that all car chasing are made with VFX and they look and feel fake. There is too much useless drama that leads nowhere, the ending is pointless.Is pretty clear to me that they used the success of Train to Busan, and marked this movie as sequel, just to attract people, as nobody would even consider to watch this garbage.

It is well acted. A fairly decent story.
My main gripe was the CGI car chases. They looked so fake and it was a regular thing throughout the film. The movement of the vehicles was bad and cheapened the whole feel. The cars didnt have the correct movements.
The set pieces and cityscapes in ruins looked great.
The zombies continue to impress in their creative and original jerking movements especially as they first 'turn'. Loved that.A few totally cheese parts, the grandad & the Jane character!? Oh dear.

It is a sequel to the Train to Busan movie epidemic, and is set 4 years later, where most of Korea has been deserted and flooded by zombies. The story and the protagonists are independent of the first film and the style of the film is completely different from the first. It focuses more on action and effects and less on emotion, clearly influenced by American cinema. In some cases, with the car-fights, it even looks like Mad Max movie. Despite the increased action and effects, however, in some places it becomes boring and overall has less suspense than the first film.

Train to Busan was amazing and I thoroughly enjoyed the fact it was very well done. The sequel on the other hand was not. I thought for sure they must have different directors, but again disappointing to see it was the same person. I imagine there was a budget increase for the sequel, but instead of bolstering the effects it did the opposite. The car scenes... don't even get me started, unbelievably over the top. Ridiculous CGI, I thought I was watching an anime, just so unnecessary.The main actor was fine, and I actually enjoyed some of the gun fights. But I couldn't stand the theatrics. The ending scene was so over dramatic it was excruciating to watch.On a positive note, apocalyptic Korea looked good, but frankly that's about it.

As they land on Korea, they realize that they are not alone. There are other surviving groups on the abandoned peninsula.

77,bastille-852-731547,"Entertaining, action-packed Korean zombie movie",7,24 August 2020,"I loved ""Train to Busan,"" which showed that it was possible to make a suspenseful and action-packed zombie movie that also had well-developed characters, gripping dramatic tension, and a uniquely clever plot. This sequel, ""Peninsula,"" is set in the same universe but centers around different characters. The film mainly centers around a soldier and his comrades in post-apocalpytic South Korea that are trying to stop a militia group called Unit 631 while simultaneously battling zombies suffering from a deadly virus that turns humans into the undead. That feels eerily relevant in today's era, unfortunately.The film is tight and cohesive, blending well-developed characters with gripping action. The film contains many types of action scenes--from fight scenes to martial arts to ""survival-house"" style chases to an incredibly gripping, ""Mad Max: Fury Road""-style multi-vehicle chase that is bonkers in the best way possible. It is very ambitious to swing for the fences trying so many different types of action scenes, but Yeon Sang-ho pulls it off incredibly well. He's able to honor some of the best techniques of many recent action films, such as ""John Wick 3: Parabellum,"" while creating a unique fusion with its own tone. The characters are well-developed and a cut above characters in a typical action film in terms of uniqueness, although none of them end up getting that much screen time by the time all is said and done. The score and cinematography are very good, although they don't match, say, the tense tempo of the score in ""Train to Busan"" or that film's outstanding color grading. The reason that this film ends up falling a bit short in comparison to its predecessor is that it's not nearly as suspenseful or sharp. Sure, it's tight, but it doesn't feel quite as sophisticated or clever. Still, this is a well-made genre film that fans of the original will certainly enjoy. 7.5/10",Peninsula

81,chevolek,Fast and Furious meets Mad Max (Bad sequel),3,26 August 2020,"""Train to Busan"" (South Korea) (2016) is probably THE best zombie movie I´ve ever seen. Way even better than The Walking Dead (which I liked only the first couple of Seasons because after that it was more about hate between humans instead of zombie stories).
This sequel ""Peninsula"" (South Korea) (2020) is exactly the opposite. It begins very good but then it turns into Fast and Furious meets Mad Max with a bad storyline. A teenage girl driving like FF´s Toretto and a tween girl as her copilot helping her to get rid of zombies (children saving the day like Transformers, Godzilla,etc) just doesn´t do it for me. it kicks you out from the story. Characters out of a Mad Max beyond Thunderdome made the movie worse. Very bad sequel from the same director. instead watch Train to Busan again instead.",Peninsula
82,Paynebyname,Unfair criticisms,7,28 March 2021,"I'd rate this film a 6.7 but it doesn't give me that option but it certainly isn't a 6.Okay, I'll agree that it isn't in the same league as the original film but it has an interesting concept (that of the Korean Peninsula just being left alone), some interesting ideas, some applaudable character actions and a bevy of exciting set pieces and hence it really doesn't deserve to be lumped together with those cheap awful horrors that you'd find that you'd find at this kind of rating.Yes, I agree that some of the driving scenes aren't the best looking CGI but the characters are likeable, you can see what is happening and it's very entertaining.Does it have a flavour of Mad Max: Fury Road - yes it does and while that film had amazing sequences and music, it also had a ridiculous story and a tiresomely woke agenda rammed down your throat.Does it have a flavour of Fast n Furious - yes it does because it has cars driven as weapons but those films had cars parachuted onto roads, driven between three skyscrapers (yes that was three) and a huge safe dragged through a Brazilian city. Ridiculous maybe but certainly entertaining.So whilst, it doesn't have the depth of Train to Busan and doesn't come close to the perfection of Kingdom, it is certainly just as entertaining, if not more so, than the empty fluff that is World War Z.If you like a zombie film, want to be entertained, appreciate a little creative thought and can overlook that it hasn't had millions thrown at it to swap out the CGI for live action, then jump onboard and try to ignore the pretensious chin rubbers who can't move beyond this being a different film than it's namesake.",Peninsula

There are some things I can criticise however. I didn't appreciate the sped up driving scenes. That seemed amateur and took away some realism. The action scenes were somewhat drawn out.
As with the first movie the characters were built up well and children played major roles to add that extra empathy from the audience.

Absolutely loved that, the story was action packed but still manages to put many heart warming scene.Moving on to Peninsula, it used it's same successful formula to create another fantastic movie with an equally amazing plot. However, this movie does have some points I do not like. For one, this movie puts too much focus on car chase scenes. Yes, car chase is cool and all but for a zombie movie, it just seems a little much. Moreover, with the many characters introduced in the movie, I feel that it leaves some of the characters underdeveloped and I did not feel anything when any characters died, more like an Okay noted let's move on kind of feeling. I do however, like that they are able add details in the movie that help in the plot later in the movie.Overall, I'd say, this is yet another interesting film to watch which I enjoyed.

94,Joejoesan,"Not as good or original as Busan, but still an entertaining zombie action film!",8,10 August 2020,"The rumours are true: Peninsula can not be compared to its brilliant predecessor, Train to Busan. Subtleties make way for non-stop action and the movie also has a big Fast & Furious vibe. But especially on the big screen it's also a very exciting and entertaining film. I'd give it an 8 out of 10.
.
The story is similar to the upcoming Army of the Dead by Zack Snyder: a group of people must go back to zombieland to retrieve some bags containing lots of money. It looks like an easy mission at first (those zombies are harmless in the dark!), but of course it all goes wrong very soon. Welcome to hell!
.
Some things that struck me while watching the film:
.
Peninsula looks amazing on the big screen (the destroyed city). However there is a lot of CGI and because of that it sometimes feels like watching a videogameThe story begins during Train to Busan and makes a timejump of four years.There are some English spoken scenes in the movie and frankly they're terrible. I can accept that Asians speak English with an accent, but there are also ""English"" or ""American"" characters in it and they act very badly. The interview scene in the beginning - telling us what happened in the last four years - is embarrassingSome emotional scenes are really over the top, but I guess that's the Korean way of dramaThere are no actors of Train to Busan in the sequelThe film only costed about 16 million dollars to make. That's low budget in the States. World War Z had a budget of 190 million.
No, unlike Train to Busan Peninsula doesn't add anything new to the zombie genre. It is however a fun and entertaining ride and the first 20 minutes are awesome. I also liked the ending.Can't wait to watch it again.8/10",Peninsula
95,DaegT,Mediocre as a zombie film,7,15 February 2021,"It's not THAT bad at all. Reminds me of Leon Kennedy in Resident Evil series. Yeap if you consider it as a Korean/Asian version of RE, then I think 7/10 is fair. A mediocre zombie action movie with typical tear-jerking attempts at the end (which is, however, not quite successful).My advice: just consider it as a typical zombie action movie in Asia. Worth a shot. Don't expect Keanu Reeves, Milla Jojovich etc in it. Def not any Hollywood superstars.",Peninsula

👨‍⚖️ Review : If you love zombie flicks, there are hugh chances you have seen the highly rated Train to Busan released in 2016. It was a blockbuster back then. The makers decide to create a sequel to it and explore options to make it a well known franchise.But Unfortunately the , experiment doesn't live up to the standards set by its predecessor. Peninsula is mediocre to say the least, credits the car chasing sequences which look as if you are playing the zombie version of a Need for Speed Game. It all terms it doesn't look realistic which differentiates itself negatively compared to Train to Busan. The Situation is forced and premise is stereotypical. With the Expectations set high for a much awaited sequel , this movie will disappoint you if you loved the first part.Overall, Peninsula has some good moments to cherish, The actors have done a great job, especially Dong-Won Gang and Jung-Hyun Lee have expressed desperation to survive brilliantly. With key emotional elements and some good horror scenes by virtue of the fast moving and terrifying zombies Peninsula is definitely worth a watch.

97,jsaleem-89705,Movie was good but those comparing with first will never been satisfied,8,21 July 2020,"I liked this movie,was good & entertaining but those people not liked this movie reason comparing this movie with first part( first part was masterpiece,Authentic,Fresh story,korean style touch,potray human emotions in depth ) but this movie seems liked watch hollywood typical action movie,i hoped this movie story will be unique with authentic korean touch ,its was better if director follow korean orignality rather then hollywood style",Peninsula
98,MovieWarfare,Completely different from the first movie,4,8 October 2020,"AKA ""Train to Busan Presents: Peninsula"" is a standalone sequel to one of the best zombie movies in decades ""Train to Busan"". When I first heard they were making a sequel and that director ""Yeon Sang-ho"" will return to direct the sequel I was thrilled. The film synopsis is that ""It's been four long years since the catastrophic events of Train to Busan (2016), and a virulent zombie outbreak sweeps South Korea from end to end. Now, on the carcass of the levelled city of Incheon, the guilt-ridden former Marine Captain, Jung-seok, embarks on a suicide mission to locate a truck carrying bags crammed with $20 million in cash, along with a trio of equally reckless fortune seekers"". The trailer for this movie is completely different from the first movie and the director calls it a ""standalone sequel"" so i'm going to try and avoid any comparison to the first movie.Usually, I start with the praises but this time I'm going to start with the negatives because this movie has a lot of flaws. The characters in this movie are just not that interesting. Jung-seok (Gang Dong-won), who is the main lead, is the most interesting as he is grieving the loss of his sister and is quite suicidal in this movie as he always puts himself at risk for the sake of others. However, he doesn't go through any dramatic character arc until right at the end and it isn't even that huge of a change. He is a cool-headed, badass shooting dude throughout the whole movie and even by the end is still that. The supporting characters are just the most over the top cartooney characters who are really lacking in any depth. I don't want to blame the actors but every single actor portrays their character in a really outlandish way that makes me cringe. The villains are especially outlandish and it just feel like they are right out of Mad Max (which might be the director's intention). There is one grounded support character Min-jung (Lee Jung-hyun) who has a connection with the main lead but she is a very one note character unfortunately.A gripe I have is the so-called ""emotional moments"". They are just not emotional whatsoever and if anything really feels like they force it upon the viewers. The movie wants us to feel sad when a character dies but when the character themselves are uninteresting then it just doesn't work. On that note, the deaths and twist are very predictable. You can probably guess a majority of them so even the story isn't going to surprise you or anything.A majority of this movie contains a lot of car chases which are all entirely CGI including the zombies and they are not very good either. These scenes make it seem like you're watching a PS2 cutscene. The zombies are also not scary and they just get powered through with ease. Also, a problem that is also in the first movie is that characters make dumb decisions. It range from not killing someone or just not checking the back of a truck. They're usually done because the plot demands it but that can really pull you out of the movie because it feels really silly.If I have any praise for the movie its the John Wick style of shooting in this movie which is pretty cool to be fair. There are some shootout scenes with zombies or humans that are visually pleasing to watch. While I do bash the PS2 CGI car chase, it is so ridiculous that it is kind of entertaining to watch. Additionally, the last act of the movie is predictable but still watching it was a nice moment. The movie also delves into some interesting aspects in terms of world-building. For example, there is racism against South Korean because of the infection and even the rest of the world's reaction to South Korea zombie plague.Overall, the movie is nothing compared to ""Train to Busan"". It does nothing new with the zombie genre and has none of the charms from the first movie. However, if you think of it as just Mad Max with zombies then there is some fun to be had here. It does feel like a B movie but it's a pretty entertaining B movie. Just don't think of it as a sequel to the legendary ""Train to Busan"" and you can probably avoid the disappointment.",Peninsula
99,fibreoptic,Fun but inferior sequel,6,27 August 2020,"I really loved Train To Busan which was an unexpected surprise. I immediately bought it on blu-ray. One of the best aspects about it was the characters and how the movie made me care about them in such a confined and hazardous space.Unfortunately Peninsula doesn't really have any characters I could warm up to or care about. It felt like a thoughtless rushed shallow sequel to pander to more of a wider audience.It started off well enough. They got on a ship and if only the film had stayed on the ship (not sure if there has been a zombie film on a ship) but nope, it quickly jumped to four years later in Hong Kong where we follow the survivors of the South Korean outbreak trying unsuccessfully to blend into society but they get the offer by some criminals to go back to South Korea and recover millions of US dollars from a truck. From then on it turns into an action movie with zombies.This isn't a terrible film if you watch it at face value but if you were hoping for the same outstanding quality as the first movie then you will probably feel disappointed. There were some fun scenes and watching zombies getting blasted is always satisfying. I watched this with my Fiancee and near the end she mentioned that it had turned into Mad Max which I can't disagree with. The ending seemed a bit forced and cheesy too.Worth a watch if you seen the first one or even just like zombie movies but you may just file it under 'just another zombie movie'.Oh and after four years I thought the zombies would have looked a bit more decayed!",Peninsula
100,Chrimle,"""Drifting to Busan 2""",4,18 October 2020,"Great acting, especially for the emotional scenes. The characters were rather bland except for the main protagonist. The CGI was ridiculously bad throughout. The comedic undertone which began quite early on did not fit the movie well and frankly ruined the following serious scenes. The action sequences were not only over-the-top but also very drawn-out. These were often right after one another, so there was very little breathing room, thus it is easy to zone out from the action for a quick breather. The movie oddly enough did not include a train, but focuses most of the movie on driving and running over zombies. Some sort of mix of a Korean ""Mad Max"" and ""Tokyo Drift"".This clearly had another philosophy behind it compared to the prequel. This was not a suspenseful and realistic horror movie, but just a plain predictable action movie.",Peninsula
101,c-kelsall,Mad Max meets Zombieland,6,14 November 2021,"On the face of it, this seems like an odd choice for a sequel, and in some circles its known as Train to Busan 2, even though there isn't a train and no one goes to or from Busan. However, it is definitely a sequel to Train to Busan, as it starts more or less where the first film left off. The narrative quickly segues forward 4 years, which gives it the opportunity to be its own thing.I described it as Mad Max meets Zombieland, but tonally it is very much like the film that spawned it. The protagonists have been rescued from South Korea, but are living as second class citizens in Hong Kong. They are persuaded by a Hong Kong crime syndicate to undertake a dangerous heist back in South Korea.Being a zombie film, there are of course plenty of zombies, and very good zombies they are too. This outing, however, also involves a lot of highway action requiring copious effects; it would be impossible to do much of it as live action because of the post-apocalyptic cityscape backdrops and crazy stunts. Unfortunately, there are several scenes which look like scenes from a driving game (like Need For Speed or Carmageddon); the effects just aren't real enough, and it stops you from suspending your disbelief.The climax was a little annoying because the survivors stood about hugging each other instead of damn well getting on the chopper and making good their escape! By rights they should have been drowned by a sea of frenzied zombies, but those were conveniently set aside while the heroes had a sentimental moment together.To cap it off, I enjoyed this latest slice of zombie mayhem, but there are some fairly serious flaws which it is hard to overlook at times. It was perhaps just a trifle too ambitious for its budget.",Peninsula
102,Luv2Spooge,One Heck of a Masterpiece,10,6 March 2021,"It is a beautifully made film and unfortunately most Westerners would not understand. Unlike Hollywood, which only focuses on actions and CGI, Korean films are often written indepth with a heart wrenching theme. Most people would compare this to World War Z, which is a bad comparison in my opinion. WWZ was just a cool action flick, don't expect much out of this.The theme of this movie is not about gore and zombies, but about the protagonist overcoming a very deep emotional personal failure that puts him in a state of depression for 4 years. This is more than simply from the death of his sister and nephew, but his failure to do the right thing when a stranded couple with a child needed their help. This is why he remembered them when he saw them again, as most people won't remember something from 4 years ago if it meant nothing to him.Throughout the film, the main protagonist struggled in survival, not against the zombie but against his own depression. He refuses to go on the mission because he just wanted to wallow in his misery. He refuses to go steal the truck back because he lost all hope watching his team gets killed and against such surmounting odds. And this culminates into the final scene where the words of his dead brother in law hits him back, ""he is tormented"" by his past failures and that is why he gave up on trying.This is a story of redemption, trial and tribulation, about overcoming the odds, past failures, and revival of the personal spirit. Just when all things come crashing down and seems like everything is wrong and the game is over, it challenges you to believe, having impossible hope, and never give up.Along with the story, the action sequence is non-stop and gives you a combination of The Last of Us, WWZ, Mad Max Fury Road, and Fast and the Furious. Many people may not understand the direction of choice for the CGI, they went with a more ""video game"" look rather than realistic. This is not ""cheap CGI,"" as if it is you would see many CGI errors and bad blending. The whole fast ending sequence was meticulously edited and mixed with real actors with the CGI that it was seamless. The reason is you have to understand South Korea is a very game focused nation, where they held actual sports broadcast over Starcraft tournaments on major cable channels.The more video game like CGI look also gave it a very beautiful and clear view of a night chase that would otherwise be too dark and hard to see. And of course that was the point, to ""draw beauty"" in what would otherwise be a disgusting run down place. Compare it to The Walking Dead, where an abandoned town or city would look like the trash heap of a typical American city today, you would not want to be there. Yet the style of art chosen for this film gives you a ""peaceful and serene"" feeling even in the absolutely torn down and abandoned Seoul. That was the aim and they hit it hard.This is one amazing film when you watch it with the right context. If you're just watching for zombie gore, it offers plenty, but you'll miss out on all the rest of what makes this a masterpiece.",Peninsula
103,ryan_sy,Didn't Live Up to the First Movie,5,26 August 2020,"I went into this movie with hope that it would continue the momentum from it's predecessor- and I was let down.I think the plot of the movie was OK, that did not let me down. The over-use of cheap CGI and fast-paced action scenes were over-blown and took away from the movie. Also, the zombies were almost just a background feature and really could have been used better.Also, the acting and dialogue could have been better. It was OK- nothing special. I felt more for the characters in the first movie.I don't regret watching the sequel, but unfortunately in an over-saturated genre, this is just a run-of-the-mill action/zombie movie[5/10]",Peninsula
104,natashialw,Just stick with the first movie.,4,11 April 2021,"This was slow and not going anywhere's, the first one is way better.",Peninsula
105,orionhi,For what it's worth,9,4 January 2021,"If you're looking for a Tom Cruise type $100 million dollar budget movie this is not it. That being said this was a good movie. Put it in perspective. Considering most movies on Prime are 2-3 stars out of 10 this one is relatively really good. There are some cheesy stupid parts but this movie is far better than most movies on prime. It's worth watching. A lot of action, zombies and a few laughs. A great movie, for Prime. And a great movie as far as Korean movies go.",Peninsula
106,FixedYourEnding,Another dissapointing sequel,5,18 October 2020,"I couldn't believe there are the same writers / directors of Train To Busan.
This is nothing like the first movie, first of there is no train, second, characters are shallow and grotesque; third it uses a lot of bad CGI for no reason at all.I would describe this movie as a bad mix of ""Mad Max"" and ""Zombieland"". The protagonist is sent to salvage and old load of cash left in the zombie-infested peninsula, where he meets some people that are stuck living there (doing things that make no sense but that's another point) very little from the 1st movie is here, even the swarming zombies are not done well here. What a disappointment! The only thing good about this movie is that it made me go back and watch the 2016 one.Exact score: 52 / 100",Peninsula
107,baehr_adam,Wrong Turn.,5,12 August 2020,"I'll start off by saying that I'm a huge fan of the series and a horror aficionado. Train to Busan was a masterpiece; especially given nobody thought zombie films could be reinvigorated when it released. Seoul Station was even legit. Peninsula was lost in translation for what made the original film the gold standard. Shallow characters, too much reliance on guns. No soul. The movie basically became what the F&F franchise became sad to say. I don't need to go over the story since it's in the description. The action was ok if not way over-the-top. The cinematography was alright. I don't know if they changed production teams or not, but didn't feel like the same budgeting went into that facet. I know the director was the same for all three films which is what surprised me that he signed off on this film. Regardless I suppose it's worth a weekend rental when it drops. My recommendation though is don't get your hopes high.",Peninsula
108,scottsideasare,"Bad, just plain bad",3,29 November 2020,"Basically no story, endless CGI. It's a very pathetic follow up to Train to Busan. Not even a sequel in any real sense.
It's like they rolled John Wick, mad max and the fast and furious into one CGI fest at the level of a PlayStation 2.
There's really annoying characters that never seem to get killed off, and the amount of over acting grates on your nerves. Yes, it's that bad.",Peninsula
109,diescobarmdq,Mad Max meets Zombies,8,26 August 2020,"Just like Train to Busan, this one had me crying more than once! Absolutely awesome ride! The main story is kind of dull, I mean the mission they go on, but everything else is just great fun!
It's basically one long car chase after another with zombies in the middle.
I hated the villains and loved the good ones! The two girls have great performances!
Just go watch it and get ready for two hours of nonstop action, and get some tissues just in case!",Peninsula
110,PaxD75,Set your expectations and enjoy an above average zombie flick,7,13 January 2021,"As far as zombie flicks are concerned, this was a fairly good one. Set your expectations and you'll find an enjoyable zombie flick with strong, memorable characters.This sequel continues the tradition of fast-running zombies (much unlike The Walking Dead...) but fails to personalize the danger. The problem: the massive army of fast-running zombies are used as a plot device - only popping up conveniently to create some minor tension. This was a major letdown and the film's biggest fail.While the original (and films like '28 Days Later') had a strong character-driven drama, this sequel had more charismatic (memorable) characters within a basic action plot. It's like comparing 'The Walking Dead' (especially the first several years) to 'Z-Nation'.I understand the negative reaction as the first film gave us more of a 'Walking Dead' theme while this second segued into 'Z-Nation' story-telling. Not only was realism lost but the franchise did not remain true to itself (attempting to cash in on the success of the first).If the first film was never done, this wouldn't be a bad standalone zombie film. I embraced the lighter, campier aspects of the film early on and took a great liking to some of the characters.Without spoilers: The two girls are among the more interesting characters to come out of the zombie genre in a long while (they would fit quite well in 'Z Nation'). The bad guys (with a kind of 'Mad Max' vibe) were also engaging (sometimes in an almost cardboard, comedic way).While the original deserved a 9, this one is easily a 7 (when compared to the 100s of other zombie films produced).",Peninsula
111,ray115,Mad Max,8,13 August 2020,"Mad Max in South Korea, a lot of infected and a lot of fast action; and the movie has its own a bit strange style.
The ending is so over the top that it is good, haven't seen such final in zombie movies.
Not sure which audio versions exists but I have preferred multiple times that some characters speak Korean and not try to speak English between themselves.",Peninsula
112,rosecalifornia,The writers were influenced by someone clearly...,2,10 September 2020,"Like everyone has pointed out this movie is a letdown.Something changed and not for the better.Train to bus an was an ultimate breakthrough SK zombie flick, it is great.. and it is clearly SK, which makes it unique in every way, storyline, cinematography, sets, SUPERIOR acting, and so on.This movie - I cant pinpoint it - but it is way too Americanized it's as if the writers or production company were pressured or influenced by american companies and/or writers.If you are a super movie buff - then you know the days of great American made movies are long gone and now the shining starts are international films and/or independent films where they can do whatever they like without bowing to string pullers.Now this movie...just lost what it had from the first one...no idea what or who changed it...but, not good.",Peninsula
113,kokomo123,wrong title,6,2 December 2020,"There is no train or busan. this is basic zombie trash. decent cgi though, atmospheric. strangely enough there is a lot of stuff for kids and comedy. ""dramatic"" ending is very asian.",Peninsula
114,Athanatos173,Train to Nowhere,4,25 August 2020,"The unfortunate truth of this sequel is that it has absolutely nothing of what the original movie had. There is no real emotional connection with the main characters.They rely on horrible CGI way too much which really takes you out of the scenes when all the car scenes and most of the zombies just look so fake.And as for the car scenes, for a moment I thought I was watching the wrong movie and was actually watching a Fast & Furious zombie sequel.To sum up, the plot is simplistic and ridiculous, the action scenes are for the most part lacklustre, there is no real connection from us the audience for the characters, though they heavy handedly try their best, unsuccessfully I may add, and the CGI is horrid.Not Recommended.",Peninsula
115,redtiago,"Continue the zombie saga, i'm glad",6,19 September 2020,"After the animated film, ""Seoul Station"" and the excellent and worldwide successful ""Train to Busan"", ""Peninsula"" premiered this year.
It doesn't have the same quality as the first ones, but it's still quite good although technically weak on the computerized effects. compensates with an interesting and well-written script. Maintains the same tone, spirit and atmosphere.
I recommend it, especially to fans of predecessors, who didn't see them, I recommend starting at least with Train to Busan, being ideal, doing like I didn't and start with Seoul Station very cool animation and makes the bridge with TtoB.",Peninsula
116,donkrishna-dk,I just Love It,8,4 February 2021,Well it is only like a zombie video game but I love the action scenes but if the CGI could be built better the movie will be more entertaining.

124,jadediamond,A Great Sequel,8,28 July 2020,"Okay, I will admit I do know all that is going on because this is a foreign film but it seems like it takes place several years after the original and it's a post apocalyptic South Korea where the survivors have adjusted to life with zombies. I'm assuming the mother and her daughters are the survivors from the original movie. It seems like they are stealing a truck full of money and satellite phone to pay for safe passage off the pensicula. It's action pack and not only does the cast have to battle the zombies, they have to fight something worse, other humans.I enjoyed the core cast. I dislike the bad guys like in the first movie where that businessman made things worse than the zombies. I was happy when they faced their punishment. I enjoyed the ending which was emotional with the background music like most South Korean media does. I'm glad it went another way and it's nice to have a little hope in a depressing world. The older daughter was awesome along with the cute little sister being a kid born in a crazy world.I like this movie. It's a South Korean action movie with zombies and guns. The only weak plot was the English actors weren't really that necessary and kind of took away from the movie. I guess they represented the United Nations or life outside of South Korea. So it was a good movie I enjoyed watching.It lacks the creativity of the first movie because the first movie was a more contained story and forced to be creative. This movie is a continuation of that story. So it's not going to be the same as the original. And the key characters of the original sacrificed themselves so the pregnant wife and little girl could live. This is the good conclusion to the first movie for those who cares about what happened to the pregnant wife and little girl once they reached Busan. I liked it and will watch again.",Peninsula
125,gabriel-80,I am baffled...,3,30 July 2020,"How can this piece of crap be by the same director that gave us Train to Busan, which is a genre masterpiece?In the first move I really cared for the characters. It was both exiting, inventive and touching. Peninsula is anything but.The whole post apocalyptic society is so kliché ridden it is embarrasing. The action scenes are ruined by crappy CGI, and the antagonists (with bad teeth) are so annoying and over the top - in that crazy, Mad Max kind of way - that they almost single handedly ruin the entire movie. As for the protagonists (with beautiful, white teeth), they manage to make them likeable, but just not enough, which makes the movies touching moments fall completely flat, and the action scenes feel utterly boring. You just don't care about them at all. All the sobbing is just cringeworthy.A waste of time. A big dissapointment.",Peninsula

Their arcs move too quickly it's hard to get attached to them. The effects weren't good either. Too much use of bad CGI; the proportions were off, and some scenes had their speed increased which looked rather jerky and not smooth. There was also so much focus on the bad guys, who were so annoying. Worst villains ever. I cannot take this film seriously.

I advise to watch ""Train to Busan"" if you are not, it is something new about Zombie Plague and very well acted and written.This second movie is not good at all. It is a bad mad max mixed with gangsters and Tokyo drift. The movie it self has no taste, no ideas, the acting is not good and the story is stupid and botched.6 examples:1 : what the hell a truck full of cash do in the first place into infected zone on Korea ? (we never know) this is the main act who push our ""heroes"" there. But you will never know why mobsters in honk kong get a truck full of cash into the worst place on earth.2 : the amount of money is 20 Millions and the mobsters offer to the 4 ""heroes"" 10 millions to do the job (2.5 each) that is totally ridiculous. Mobsters will not even know the location of their own truck ! GPS R.I.P. ?3 : Why into any apocalyptic movies bad guys organize survival game to watch people get bitten and shred to pieces ? They are nothing else to do ? Missing television so much ?4 : If the infected are grouped into the same spot why the army do not sanitize the place long time ago ? With many bombs strong enough to wipe out anything living? Problem solved.
The contamination start in South Korea, and of course North Korea do not jump on this opportunity to ""save"" the south Korea. And the rest of the world accept South Korea staying in ruin with millions of infected zombies and do nothing. And chicken can fly high high on the sky too.5 : Of course, it is totally normal to cross Hong Kong/ South Korea borders by boat like you are going to buy milk to the local grocery when a end of the world pandemic who turn people into zombie occur. Yes sure, no guard, no helicopters, no planes, no satellites, no fences, no barbwire, no coastguards, no marines, ... they justified this by using a bribe! YEAH SURE THEY BRIBE THE ENTIRE WORLD to take back 20 millions.And it is well know NO ONE watch the border of North Korea.
Even after a super plague. Nope, they all have swimming pool that day.6 : The ending of this movie is just terrible. An helicopter just pop from nowhere and save them. SURE ! Why ? how ? (we never know)And now the Oscar of the best line EVER ""jane"" !
""she made the very best decision, for everyone""
A woman is locked into a cabin truck surrounded by zombie and put a m16 on his head to end his life. ... ok ... but his daughter is in the arms of ""jane"" i am sure this is the best line to say by any rescuer to a 6 years old girl who will be never traumatize at all watching his mother like that.
Surely the little girl will look at Jane and say : ""you are right, can i have a lolly pop ?""Do not waste time on this movie. Super bad.",Peninsula

It's just bad. Compared to it's prequel, this film is definitely not upto the mark but that doesn't mean that it wasn't interesting.The film takes time to unravel, until then, all we watch is disposable characters making stupid decisions and dying a horrible death but once we are into the story, as it takes pace, there are some intense action that you can watch.Unlike last time, there's nothing you can held onto in this film. There are no important characters that you feel for, so the filmmakers brought an entire family into this film (with absurd explanation) and we shall be holding onto them.The climax was satisfying, proving us that this film is not an entire disaster. It's just an average one time watch film that's boring in the first half and takes us to the edge of the seat in the second half for brief moments. It deserves 6 out of 10.Signing off, daretoreadme.",Peninsula
131,ggcarbone,PENIS-ULA,3,2 March 2021,"This movie is not even close compared to Train To Busan. The plot was really poor, the virtua-city, virtua-zombies and virtua-car races are pretty unreal, like a PS 5 game instead of a movie. The zombies are just decoration on the entire movie, you could easily forget about the zombies and the plot won't change. More than half of the movie are just refilling of car's pursuits hitting zombies on the streets, it looks that the writers weren't too inspired. The end of the movie wanted to touch me ""again"" as Train To Busan but it didn't work and looked too cliché. I hope there is no Train to Busan 3.",Peninsula
132,matt_zxy,Very poorly Executed,3,21 February 2021,"This film should have been much better than this, because it has a good story but very poorly crafted. It's seem like a movie that was made only for money because the 1st film was successful. This film was completely garbage if compare to the 1st film, look like a different director eventhough the director was a same person.Many illogical moments, the zombies was funny and not scary at all, very different from the 1st film. The most terrible thing in this movie was the CGI, like watching a film from 1980 something. I mean, why bother use CGI in car scenes? We have tons of high performance drivers in the entire world. Why trying so hard to ruin the 1st film by making this sequel crap.",Peninsula
133,rdoanderson,I really enjoyed it,8,4 April 2021,Read the other reviews and you get the idea madmax/fast and furious with zombies.What's not to like?Ok the CGI was a bit off-putting at times but how else are you honesty going to manage it.Anyway it's a decent exciting film with some quite nice ideas thrown in.I also thought the acting was pretty good all in all (westerners excluded),Peninsula
134,neoclone07,The way asian do cinema,5,31 August 2020,"Just finished watching Train to Busan: Peninsula. I also watched the first one, years ago.
If you know anything about korean cinema, you know it's not like ocidental cinema. You have to watch it open minded, because it's a totally different culture, thus a totally diferent way to do most things.
All in all, it's a good movie, not as good as the first one. Peninsula is packed with action (the korean way), solid acting, a bit way too dark in most scenes, but ok. And it's not a horror movie. Don't expect that. If you want some scary moments go look somewhare else.
The car chase sequences are clearly all computer generated FX. Ocidental viewers not used to korean cinema would think of it as cheap FX but after so many years watching asian movies I understand it's kinda how they like to do. Special effects are notably fake on purpose. Take a look on The Wandering Earth. Cool, but fake written on its face.
Towards the end it gets more and more drama centered, as a korean movie must be. And the final sequence is the epicenter! Everyone is crying, screaming... guess the zombies stoped to understand what all that racketiring is about. BUT that's not bad, not at all... it's just the way they do cinema, which is different from ocident. And I like it. It's a step out my confort zone.
So, get out of your confort zone and watch something different.",Peninsula

Still, was excited when the opening credits began and we were off on another adventure. The film does a great job of keeping the action and excitement coming, but everything is watered down compared to the first film. The character development is weaker, as is the plot. You're not able to fully connect with the characters the way you were in Train to Busan. Don't get me wrong. There are a few moments in Peninsula that will tug at your heartstrings, but they feel formulaic and forced here, where they just seemed a natural part of the original's story.

There is no train in this movie at all just a lot of cars..its not a sequel to the first movie just using the same pandemic that's started in Korea...This movie has a very different vibe from the first movie... it is not really a survival zombie movie like the first one..no really thrilling zombie scenes compared to the first one.. more to war between humans with car racing and guns..There are some questionable facts in this movie such as a mother who let her kids riding cars like that ..and a really young girl who can drive like that is too good to be true.. a group of people survived that long but did not in anyway try to contact the outside world? But instead capture people and have fun watching them being killed by zombies..Did not really feel anything when some of the characters died..

145,myignisrules,What the hell went wrong?,4,31 August 2020,"Damn. How the might have fallen.Train to Busan was a breath of fresh air to the zombie genre. A movie that managed to do what no other zombie movie ever did for me before, deliver adrenaline fuel action while connecting on a deep emotional level the likes of which I've never seen or felt watching these type of films. So like most other people, when I heard there was going to be a sequel, brought to me by the same Director and co-writer of the original screenplay Sang-ho Yeon, well to call me excited would be an understatement.Sadly, PENINSULA turned out to be a hollow shell of its predecessor. A movie that had all the right ingredients, yet none of the heart, energy or sophistication of the first.Taking place four years after Train to Busan, the story focuses on Jung Seok, played by Dong-Won Gang , a soldier who during the initial outbreak made some questionable decisions in his pursuit to protect his family, only to see everything fall apart in the worst way. He's then asked to return to the Peninsula with a group of misfits, to retrieve a huge sum of cash that was lost and in doing so, is given a second chance to finally do the right thing.It's a solid premise for a sequel that should've been as fun, heartfelt and engaging as the first movie. Instead our lead hero feels like he's sleepwalking through his role. I never got a sense of who he truly was as his performance lacks any substance or nuance. Honestly, he's more of a zombie than the actual zombies on screen. And speaking of the undead, this time around they went for a lot, and I mean A LOT more CGI than the first film, so most of the action sequences play like you're watching video game footage than an actual movie. World War Z had more believable looking hordes and that's saying something!The rest of the cast (with the exception of three people I'll get to) is just as bad. Our villains are cookie-cutter bad guys with no sense of how they got to be the way they are. We get a Neegan knot-off named Sergeant Hwang and a bunch of other disposable types not even worth mentioning.Truthfully, Train to Busan didn't have villains in the true sense of the word, it had scared people making decisions based on fear, which made them relatable and in a word, human. The human element and the relationships formed during that crisis is a large part of what made the story work.This movie instead chooses to focus on action set pieces that felt like a mash up of The Walking Dead meets Mad Max meets Left 4 Dead. That last one being a video game folks.The only light in this bleak tunnel of a film is shined by the ladies of this world. Specifically a mother and her two daughters. Min-Jung played by actress Jung-hyun Lee is outstanding in her role and if you asked me, the whole movie plot line should've centered around her and her fight to survive and protect her young precocious daughters. They were the best things about this film and they were relegated to sub plot for much of the movie's runtime.Long story short, Peninsula was the biggest disappointment fo me (movie-wise) this year. What should've been a strong sequel and a fun movie ended up being just another generic zombie movie to add to the pile of them that are out there.I never thought I would be saying this about the sequel to Train to Busan, but skip it and go watch a much better Korean zombie flick that dropped this year, #ALIVE instead.",Peninsula

The only part which felt a bit silly was the ending with the Van and the awful CGI. But I'm guessing this movies budget wasn't huge.I personally feel the 5.9 rating is a little harsh, but I never watched the first and can understand the hype that was around this film.If you are on the fence, definitely worth a watch.

Only Train to Busan and 28 Days later go on my list of best 100 movies of all time. So while I had high hopes my expectations where not high. But director Sang-ho Yeon has delivered a suspenseful emotion filled action packed thriller. It delivers on all levels. I was on the edge of my seat and cared aboutall the main characters.

152,ReaLMoisan,"It's not Good, but it does One Thing Alright.",5,13 November 2020,"If you loved Train to Busan (2016), and expect more of the same in Peninsula (2020), you're going to be disappointed. The over the top CGI car chase scenes are poorly rendered, far too numerous, and go on for far too long. There are many other issues with the movie too, but that's not really the intent behind this review.I really want to touch on one thing this movie does fairly well. This is the only reason I gave this movie a score of 5 out of 10, and not a 3 or 4. This is something that The Walking Dead franchise absolutely fails at doing. Despite The Walking Dead airing for 11 seasons, and Fear the Walking Dead airing for 6 seasons there's something neither of those shows has ever done correctly. That's put effort into taking the setting and characters seriously when it comes to a humans ingenuity and resourcefulness to survive. This movie takes the treat of zombies seriously, and imagines what people would do to survive such monstrosities.The fact TWD has slow zombies, yet often has characters dying by ridiculous and contrived ways to their neutered zombies only magnifies the discrepancies. Peninsula takes zombies seriously, and write characters that think the same. The writers and director actually have characters that utilize their wits and intelligence to their advantage. After all, it's how humans climbed to the top of the food chain in the first place.TWD has always tried to say it's the humans who are the real danger to mask their lazy writing. If that was true, then why do so many characters die to zombies in TWD and FTWD then? Imagine the characters from Peninsula existing in TWD universe, forcing writers to actually have to devise creative and interesting ways to believably get characters in compromising situations. It would show respect to the audience and their intelligence, and that they actually take pride in their craft.I don't consider this movie a successful spiritual successor to Train to Busan, it's an action movie with little of the emotional gravitas of the original. But it does do something fairly well, something the more popular TWD franchise has never done correctly. They try to take a zombie apocalypse seriously by writing characters that take their situation seriously. Deaths by zombies feel earned, and narrow escapes feel rewarding. Having characters behave like they actually want to survive adds to the tension and atmosphere. It's unfortunate that many other aspects of the movie are so disappointing, and not taken as seriously. They didn't have enough respect for the original and it's fans to make a genuine sequel, worthy of being it's successor. Which is an all too common trend in entertainment recently.",Peninsula

The first theme is about survival, fighting between people and zombies, while the second one is reduced to a melee between gangs. The screenwriter wants to learn the American TV drama TWD. Unfortunately, the movie can't make the American drama Negan's ruthlessness. A group of third-rate gangsters occupy the mountain as king.2. The first flight basically relied on legs. This one basically popularized off-road vehicles. Basically everyone must have a talent for drift racing. Your death can only show that your car skills are not good enough. This greatly weakens the atmosphere of terror. I thought I was watching Fast and Furious 9! It's a bit like Mad Max 4.3. The reason for the success of the first film is that the love between father and son runs through the whole story. The second one can be regarded as the role of a separate stove.

Let's be honest, it is a zombie film after all, but they spent a decent amount of time developing the characters. Just enough that we begin to feel a little bad when one of them gets eaten. The scenery in this film is magnificent. You really feel like you are immersed in a post apocalyptic city. The costuming was spot on as well.

182,TheSmallDeth,A great follow up to Train To Busan,7,10 August 2020,"Don't believe all the extremely low reviews about Train To Busan 2: Peninsula. Even though the movie might be laking on a few points, it's a great and exciting movie.The action and zombie scenes are great, there is a perfect balance between tense situations and moments of character development. I read some reviews on here claiming that there was no character development at all, I bet they didn't even see the ending... You may feel more for certain characters then others but I guess thats also just the charm of the zombie-genre (take the walking dead for example), you'd probably feel te same in a real life zombie apocalypse :-)I was just enjoying the hell out of this movie and I was on the edge of my seat throughout the whole thing. Just don't expect a Train To Busan copy, because then indeed you'll be disappointed. Before you go, realize that this movie is 4 years later. In most of the zombie series/movies I've seen, thats enough time for the humans to get grip on the world and start to take over; resulting in them becoming more of a threat/monster than the zombies do at that point. Just as in those other movies/series, zombies are more used as a weapon/distraction or tool than a weapon in itself. Train To Busan 2 is no exception.Furthermore; soundtrack is great and adds a lot, i've seen complaints about the cgi; cgi is fine, characters are interesting enough (perhaps lack a bit of backstory but it's ok), acting is great, story is good.Can't wait to see where they'll take it from here. I highly suggest every zombie genre fan to check this out ASAP, it's worth it. And also for people who've seen Train To Busan, just go in open minded and you won't be disappointed!",Peninsula

184,taxifree,The disappointment in Busan,4,29 August 2020,"Let's start with the original, Train to Busan, which was fantastic.
That movie had it all, good action, interesting story, fantastic zombies with their speed and rage and it was giving me the same wow-feeling as Dawn of the dead did in 2004.After the fantastic first movie the word got out that they were gonna make Train to Busan 2(Peninsula), and I started to look forward to it. During the wait for Peninsula the Koreans came with another fantastic movie, Parasite(2019), and expectations became even higher. Two of the most interesting movies the last few years were suddenly Korean.Then finally Peninsula was released. And WHAT a disappointment it was... Seriously, what went wrong? I mean, the movie is ok I guess, but that's all..
Instead of giving us another great story they just made a worse version of mad max mixed with zombies and som fast&furious elements. No good story, poor acting from many of the actors, and just another pointless action movie with no chance against other good action movies.
This movie is a huge disappointment because Train to Busan was so great.
If you liked Train to Busan and are considering this, O recommend that you either watch the first movie another time or watch Parasite instead of you haven't already seen it",Peninsula

This movie is an absolute popcorn nacho cheese with salsa joy, from the beginning untill the end!Is it because of the current state of our world that this virus- themed flick had me laughing and crying? Hell yes!! That's what movies supposed to do!! And this one just nails it!!The minus 2 is for some overdramatic scenes and occasional peak at what clearly is a CG car.

195,MrNeurosis,Tried too hard to copy Hollywood,2,20 July 2020,"The reason first movie worked was because it had a heart. It's almost cruel how much the film tugged at your heartstrings.Train to Busan wastes no time getting to the point, the build up only takes a few brief scenes, then the madness captivates the rest. We see the outbreak from beginning, middle and end within the narrative's run time. You have time to develop empathy for each character, their backstories, and connections to one another fleshed out in small bursts throughout the film. While the human condition is in question, the narrative also explores societal themes, which are all perfectly juxtaposed with gory yet skillfully crafted action sequences.This movie on the other hand may as well be directed by Michael Bay with pointless action and explosions. It tries too hard to be like Hollywood action movies and it shows. I will pretend this movie never happened.",Peninsula
196,aovannor,Bit of a rollar coaster,7,26 August 2020,"This movie will mess with you a bit, especially if you've seen Train to Busan.At first, it seems a strong start but it doesn't take long for it to become something akin to Mad Max: Zombie Edition. This feels out of place considering how serious the first movie was. The action during this part is good and the Korean wasteland looks excellent. If you've played The Last of Us video game then you'll probably think they took inspiration from it, like I did, in terms of the visual style. But, the horror and emotion is kind of missing during this section of the movie and, as a typical Zombie movie trope, humans become the real enemy for a while. That's so cliche that I'm fed up of seeing it now. This part of the movie isn't 'bad', it's just probably not what you signed up for. It's still entertaining but in a different kind of way.The ending is the real star of the whole movie though. They seem to throw all the emotion that the movie was lacking at you all at once. There's some very satisfying conclusions. It makes the whole thing worthwhile because without what came before, the ending wouldn't have been as impactful.",Peninsula

* the film's setting is too obvious that it is a studio in all its worst-engineering; it's better to just make it in animation, rather than this very bad set.
* you want real zombie battle? you want real zombie fight? then you should get back to the first Train To Busan, not this one.

Instead, this film is about human greed, desperation, and lotsa car racing. The zombies are there, but they're merely obstacles in the road. Sad. There was one (brief) scene with zombies against the glass that instilled the fear and suspense a zombie movie should have, where your very fate may be decided by a sudden noise or shift in movement, and survival depends upon speed, quick-thinking and holding your breath as something gruesome slithers by. What we got instead was World War Z meets Mad Max - boom and bang - with a plot, yes, but nothing of import. What's at stake? The world? Nope. A cure? Nope. The Korean people?! Nah. Guilt. Mmm Maybe.

205,mlwcsc,Well this train derailed...,3,31 July 2021,"So I am not going to compare it to the first one. The first movie was one of the best zombie movies of the modern era and measuring against that will almost always leave a movie wanting. Instead I am going to just look at this movie in a vacuum.So overall, this is not a zombie movie. This is an action movie that just happens to have zombies in it. I would argue that you could basically take the zombies out of this movie without having to change the plot all that much.The main conflict is humans vs. Humans. The main threat is humans. The zombies are for a large part basically reduced to an environmental hazard.Many of the characters are shallow and their motivations and backgrounds are left unexplored.Now lets look at the action, because there is a lot of it, and I mean A LOT. There is so much action that the movie pretty much drown in it. It is not well paced going from action piece to action piece with little to no character or plot development in between.A large part of the action consists of driving sequences and lets be honest that market is pretty saturated with movies that did it better than this one. To put it bluntly, it gets kinda tedious.In conclusion, if you just want a dumb action movie where you won't need to use your brain, then this movie might be for you. Otherwise I would give it a pass.",Peninsula

210,confrank,Decently fun first two acts profoundly crippled by terrible finale and ugly effects,4,11 September 2020,"Ugh, was this really the follow-up to Train to Busan?Here's what I LIKED: Some great zombie action sequences, the way the John Wick-adjacent main character brings some serious edge every time he has to fight, a Mad Max Thunderdome style game that is quite exciting, and a Korean girl that drives better than every cast member from the Fast and Furious films.What did I DISLIKE...The CGI. It's ass-ugly, very cheap, and constantly relied on. The worst I've seen all year.The lighting. I swear when it's nighttime and there's no natural lighting around, you can tell there are studio lights illuminating everything and it looks fake. What happens when there are lights present outside? It's a blinding bombardment of lens flares.The moronic little villain character who by the end he's incredibly annoying.And finally, the entire final 30 minutes, which takes all of these weaknesses, along with an extremely cheesy ending including constant crying, predictable plot beats and slow motion, that combines all of these poor elements like a Mighty Morphin Power Ranger and utterly cripples what was before that a reasonably enjoyable zombie film.

Plot wise the story contunues to highlight family, in this instance a captain and the brother in law he is estranged from, and a second anchored by an aging grandfather who could easily been dismissed as senile, his very strong daughter and her two girls.
Throw in HK gangsters and a dishounored former military unit doing its best to survive in Inchon.
Shake and stir.
The action is non stop, which actually distracts from the adversaries' character development and any actual suspense or mystery.
Everyone is too well armed, quite the contrary to TRAIN TO BUSAN which was pared down to just the necessary.
Its characters served a purpose that propellled the story along, and those characters were of interest, so their demise was felt.
I did not know the lead actor, though I have seen enough Korean films. I would not place to much blame on his shoulders.

230,acinemalens,Peninsula: An entertaining yet Disappointing of a Smart Sequel,5,15 July 2020,"When Train to Busan hit theaters, it became a sensational hit for the right reasons. It manages to become an enjoyable blockbuster yet with smart social commentary and emotional moments that (I need to admit) made me cry. 4 years later, Peninsula - the sequel - hit the theaters with high ambition but fail to reach the height of its predecessor as it falls into the ordinary sequel trap.4 years after the events of Train to Busan, a former marine, Jung-Seok (Gang Dong-won) must return and retrieve something at now-abandoned Korea in order to be accepted by the society outside their homeland. I really appreciate how they took a new approach to the zombie sequels with a new setting. However, bigger doesn't always mean better as the world-building lacked in the concept details of that never reach the tension felt in its predecessor.Perhaps the above reason can't be blame due to its small yet important component: characters. A large number of characters also resulted in less screen-time, making it hard to have in-depth sympathy with the characters. The characters also felt flat with its two-dimensional personality, making it hard for the characters to be likable even when the actors have given their best to portray them. As a result, it lacks emotional attachment and even scares to deliver.Still, I can't deny on how much entertaining Peninsula has to offer. Yeon Sang-ho's use of camerawork and how he directs the action sequence make the film watchable. I preferably like the first chase scene with zombies and the survival game. The survival game especially, really showcases his direction with his one-take. The visual style could be deemed as unique as well, showing abandoned Korea as dirty and chaotic yet beautifully eye-catching. Although I need to say that the CG in its car scene is extremely rough that you somehow looking more of a video game than a live-action film.Overall, Peninsula is could never reach its predecessor quality as a smart blockbuster with a high emotional level. However, its entertainment value, if almost, could still reach what it had left 4 years ago. Just don't expect too much to use your brain and have fun as you visit Peninsula.",Peninsula

The thing that made the first one excellent was the relationship between the father and daughter. Here we have two brother in-laws which would have been a great focus however the film adds too many characters earlier on for you to not care about anyone. The film also relies very heavily on cgi which takes you out of the experience . Peninsula has action, more then the first which a lot of people will love but that does not make it particularly better as the film struggles to find its identity as a result of the many subplots.

241,DrVankman,Definitely Best Movie of 2020,10,30 August 2020,"In 2020, when almost all movie projects have been canceled due to the pandemic, we unexpectedly receive the long-awaited sequel of the Train to Busan (2016) movie.
Stylistically, the sequel is not very similar to the first part. Unlike the Train to Busan, where all the action was tied to the train, in the second the filmmakers went further and expanded the universe. Now the viewer plunges into a city numb from dead silence, where zombies rule the town during the day, and groups of survivors are come out on the streets at night. The movie changes direction a little, leaning more into a driving horror action movie with a huge amount of action.
In some places it may seem that something in the film has already been seen somewhere, everything can be reduced to a cliché. However, the pace of the narration without unnecessary scenes does not get tired until the finale - this is a kind of dynamics inherited from the previous film. Every detail in the film is in place and completely unique filmed. The Train to Busan described a meeting with horror and its gradual realization. Peninsula shows a world that has come to terms with the consequences of a terrible epidemic.
Definitely the best movie of 2020. Hope to see the third part of this zombie franchise in the future.",Peninsula

246,fatherofchicks,An incontinence family adult movie?,3,21 December 2020,"A sequel to the horror hit blockbuster Train to Busan. This movie shares the same title with an additional Peninsula. Which means an abandoned city now called Peninsula or Seoul. No trains are involved unlike the first.The first movie was definitely an horror movie with much suspense. The second was just a mix of genres involved.This movie tries a lot of stuff or tried to make the movie different but failed miserably because it made it inconsistent!GOOD
Fleshing out the zombies.
The movie shows how the zombies react to food. Zombies are attracted to bright lights and loud sounds, which made sense to why they chase living victims.New take on a sequel.
First movie was about train, second about abandoned city. Though at the start, the outbreak happened on a survivor ship, which was nice and then it immediately moved to the city.
It felt like post-apocalyptic movie, much like Mad Max.Nice action.
The main hero was fast in gun reaction, and sharp shooting.Light mood.
Even though the movie is meant to be dark and scary, it had some light moment that might reduce the suspense or tone the horror down, which is a good thing. Basically I am talking about joking scenes, not many in the movie but the way they were used in the right mood and moment were good and fair.
BAD
Too much CG.
The movie was cluttered with CG, especially with the driving scene, it was unrealistic and too exaggerated, even for a 16yr old to be driving with much skills.
This was the first flaw in the movie, the overexaggerated driving by a 16yr old, really made the movie unrealistic and a stupid joke.Lack of Suspense moments.
The first had a lot of suspense and edge of the seat moving moments. This movie had few or was not compelling and shocking enough.Family movie or adult movie?
I can understand a child can be used as a hero or main character in an adult movie, such as the Shining or A Quiet Place.
Even though a child is used as a main character, the childishness of a child or cuteness should not get in the way of the horror or suspense of the movie.
The highlights for the child in the movie just felt like I was watching Spy Kids movie.Unrealistic.
Someone gets shot and later on is alive, wtf!?
Driving with crazy skills as a 16yr old with exaggerated CG.
Someone wanted to commit suicide at the end and all of a sudden decided to change the mind and be with loved ones.No connection.
The movie does not have character development therefore you don't connect with them, even though they die.
Such as a character who died at the end and everyone crying, how can you connect with that emotional moment when that character had less screen time?
I wanted to give this a 4/10 but the cringe at the end made me stopped watching the movie.What happened!? Seriously what happened to this movie? Was it a lot of money given to production and director? Was it the director trying to be too creative and publisher not limiting him? Was it just bad director they hired for the sequel?Very very disappointing movie, shame! Shameful!",Peninsula

248,dyonisus,"Peninsula, not Train to Busan 2",5,7 October 2020,"First off, this is basically a stand-alone film marketed as a sequel, trying to imitate the sucess of the first film. The story is set in the same universe, four years later. No other characters from the original, stunning and emotional Train to Busan remain.
Song-Ho Yeon could have just invented another reason for the outbreak, slap a four-years later on and at least not lie about this film being a sequel, which was clearly done for monetary purposes.Now onto the actual film. Where TtB builds amazing characters, (flawed) heroes and villains alike, this film doesn't. While the main character again battles his inner demon and recognizes his flaw, just like the father in TtB, the other characters had little to no impact.
The film is trying hard to be badass, cool and filled with action, but it forgets to build character - which is a shame considering TtB was excellent at it. The deaths don't feel impactful, and unlike the first film it has a happy ending which felt suprisingly unsatisfying.
The big takeaway is that Song-Ho Yeon may have been a master of emotions in TtB, but has forgotten his true power in favor of action, mediocre CGI and a bunch of unrealistic car stunts in Peninsula.
In the future, I would love to see him tackle new, stand-alone horror movies which have a heavy emphasis on characters and emotions and aren't blinded by CGI and useless action.If anything, I can truly appreciate the greatness of Train to Busan even more after this: a film that rounds everything up so beautifully, it does not need a sequel.",Peninsula

Both have zombies.
Both have Koreans in Korea speaking....Korean.
Both have blood.
Sorry folks, that's about all I've got.
I don't think I even saw a train.Perhaps that explains some the disappointment people have while I'm not particularly bothered by it. I didn't go into it expecting Train To Busan 1 part 2 and to be quite honest, I'm happy this wasn't just another train ride.I guess I'll address ""too much action, not enough zombie"". I'll stick with ""a zombie movie with action"" or "" an action movie with zombies"" lest I find myself on a subjective spectrum trying to define ""too much"" and ""not enough"" in a way meaningful enough for other people to understand what I'm even talking about.Guns factor into the action aspect too I suppose.I have to say the poster art was a bit of a spoiler.If that magically sailed right by me, an opening scene with a dude in military garb would have been a pretty good clue.I wasn't shocked and amazed that this had more shooting than Train to Busan.Cars.....yep,there were cars and people drove them.I would categorize it as The Road Warrior/Mad Max with zombies. It just seems more accurate than Not Slow And More Than A Little Angry with zombies.
...And for the love of God NO!!! The car sequences in this are nowhere near as spectacular as The Road Warrior/Mad Max.Now for the fun part...Was it as good as Train to Busan concerning plot and character development??
Big NOPE!Can you see the further adventures of Yoo Gong and Su-an Kim as they roam the zombified hellscape of South Korea searching for kimchi and a new train to ride in this....""sequel""?

If I listened to critics I would have missed out on a lot of really great movies..but also avoided a few absolutely horrible ones that they thought were just the best films anybody could ever hope to see.I gave a few brief examples of some complaints I have read or heard that were in no way deal breakers for me while avoiding spoilers.It's about 2 hours long.

Minimal dialogue to connect characters, but enough to give meaning and weight to their journeys. The action scenes were well-planned to give a different setting and mood for each one.The daughters were the stand out characters for me.The soundtrack was diverse and well-matched to the different shifts in tone. A key part of the whole experience.The cinematography, pacing and editing took us on a wild ride. Excellent use of lighting, not only for setting and space, but also for plot points in some instances.The CG treatment for some parts of the vehicle chase scenes were not seamless, but went by fast enough that I could just accept them as part of the extreme physics being pushed. So, I wasn't troubled by those few seconds here and there.Some side characters were a bit caricatured, but still had satisfying moments.It reminded me of a gritty, more realistic Mad Max: Fury Road - plus zombies.The zombie movement designs are wonderfully bizarre and unsettling.It's not necessary to see the first film (Train to Busan). The zombies in this one are an aspect of the story but not the main focus. So people seeking the same thrill as the tension and terror of the first one might be disappointed.

I found some scenes so cliche.. so Hollywood like.

291,louissecypil,Entirely separate from the first movie,6,20 June 2021,"I had no expectations, whatsover, for this movie. I understand that it's an installation to that awesome Train to Busan movie, but I didn't really force myself to think that they were directly related. Saw this after seeing Zack Snyder's Army of the Dead and this had more sensible scenes, story and likeable characters. Since the majority of the film took place 4 years after the zombie outbreak, I think it's only common that the zombies do not instill that much fear anymore. The people living in the Peninsula are more accustomed to how zombies act. The real villains here are the people. The Captain Seo character was pretty laughable, I thought he'd have a redeeming character arc but he turned out to be just another villain to spike up the tension in the movie. I like how this is watchable even with kids. It did try to pull heart strings but it fell flat. The male lead also had scenes where he looked like a blank paper. Overall, this is still a watchable movie. Entirely separate from Train to Busan though.",Peninsula
292,samplefreeze,Definitely Recommended (Don't trust the bad reviews),10,16 August 2021,"Great characters, great action, good emotional depth. A great and accurate depiction of how people would become in a lawless land. Despite having a common enemy (the zombies), humans some how end up turning on each other or rather a few of the strong ones end up bullying the ones desperate to survive. It also shows the incompetence of government in truly life threatening situations. I know train to busan is a much different movie than peninsula but I ended up liking the ""sequel"" more than the first movie. There are some very, in my opinion, inaccurate reviews that are dragging down the IMDb score of this movie. It might not actually be a 10 but I definitely recommend it to any zombie, action or dystopian movie fan and to movie fans in general.",Peninsula

They throw in way to much Hollywood wannabe actioncrap, try way to hard to include every genre into one, to pretend this is something else then it should be.I really loved Train to Busan, it was an awesome and unique Zombie flick with high quality. Emotional ride with fear, stress and good story. Was glued on the monitor whole movie through, it was that good. Korea really made a classic with that one.This is the complete opposite. Its plain stupid. Zombies seems pretty harmless cgi placeholders only meant to fly in the air and get hit by cars. U never feel any kind of fear och horror in this movie, its just dumb action with stupid lines. Story is crap, writing is crap, very low character development, plotholes, timejumps, stupid characters, actors who overact and make a fool out of themself.If you take Transformers, mix it with Zombieland on drugs, add Fast and the furious... ehm... and then add World War Z cgi zombies on a budget then u get this. But worse then all those movies ofcourse.The carchases are computer generated, and it looks like a PC-game. Also most of the Zombies are just cgi, ragdolls flying all over...and it really shows its fake. Its World War Z style, but cheaper ripoff. When the end comes closer, they even try to switch the pace from rollercoaster action to emotional cry drama and it just falls flat like a pancake... u end up laughing cause its so silly.Plus, the plot armour on the soldier is of epic proportions, he cant miss, hits only headshots, zombies throw themself on him, but he got his anti-bite armor on so they cant touch him, he got time to think a few seconds now and then, even if he is surrounded by soldiers or zombies on every direction... cause they wont do anything to him while he feels sad.... boohoo....Stay away from this at cinema, its not worth the money.

The first and second film are two completely different films you shouldn't really compare the two because that's when you become disappointed with the second film. One it's own this film is entertaining however I thought it was a bit silly during some parts mostly because of how much CGI they used, it eventually just becomes unreal and very much like a video game. Don't get me wrong it looks great the technology they used makes it look sort of life like but there was just something that didn't sit right with me while watching. It's probably because of the amount of jumping and speeding the cars did yet the CGI cars are completely fine without a single dent.... it all just became really unrealistic especially when the CGI zombies and city came in. It's not exactly a strong film on its own and obviously compared to its first film (which you shouldn't really compare but still)... Train to Busan is much better overall.A reason out of many of why I gave this film 4 stars is because near the end it also becomes really dramatic and kind of painful to watch. You sit there thinking why couldn't she have done that 5 minutes ago instead of sitting there? Also wouldn't you be dead by now? Lots of slow motion dramatic scenes near the end too which made things really cheesy for me.It's a entertaining film on its own if you watch it without expecting anything as good as Train to Busan, but there are many let down parts for me that could have been way better :(",Peninsula
308,TheFinalGirl13,Everything at once,6,24 July 2020,"Peninsula is an extremely fun movie to watch. It packs virtually all genres possible, the movie is way too much but very entertaining. You have zombies (although they are not really threatening and felt more like a tool used to advance the plot), you have Mad Max-like car chases, you have wild insane people enjoying the Purge, you have a hint of a comedy and a whole lot of soap opera drama. At one point I was convinced the characters would start dancing Bollywood-style!
While Train to Busan was character-driven and emotional film, Peninsula is a wild, action-packed movie which has almost nothing to do with the former. It would fit perfectly into Zombieland universe and the reviews here would be much better then. In other words, it is a bad movie if you expect Train to Busan continuation but a good Zombieland 3.
Plot-wise, Peninsula leaves even more question unanswered, if you think about characters' background or some story details you'll notice a lot of inconsistencies, plot holes and unclarities. But this movie is not made to think, so don't take it seriously, don't expect much and just enjoy whatever nonsense is going on on-screen.",Peninsula
309,darren_stretch,A better sequel that I was expecting,8,10 December 2020,Really enjoyed this film. The plot takes Train to Busan in a different direction but if you liked the first film you should watch this. The action sequences and the car chase finale is really gripping. The latter in particular is reminiscent of Mad Max. I can't believe how people can be so down against this film. I think it's good that they moved the story in a different direction.,Peninsula

It hits the marks where it's supposed to, except in the final stretch where the human drama gets in the way of a satisfying wrap-up.

311,emoboyz-92605,A CLISE AND DISAPPOINTING ZOMBIE SEQUEL,6,7 September 2020,"Why do I really like Train to Busan? It is a film that takes on a genre that has appeared very often in other films but manages to turn it into a unique and clever film, utilizing its closed environment to present adrenaline-pumping moments, and also it is a scary film.And what about his sequel, Peninsula? With a very heavy heart, I have to say I am disappointed. With great anticipation I am waiting for it to be released, especially since the news about a sequel for Train to Busan has been circulating, I am curious about what more creepy worlds director Yeon Sang-ho and writer Park Joo-Suk are ready to present.The result is a film that is full of cliché moments from horror films and zombies and has no tense or creepy moments like the previous films. And when I have encountered a scene that should have touched my heart, I instead found a scene that was dragged too long and instead of being touched I felt cringe.You must drink this! So that 120/80 tension and clean blood vessels
Soldiers Jung-seok (Gang Dong-won) decide to leave South Korea which is currently being attacked by a zombie outbreak. Together with his brother and family, he got into a car and went to a large ship that would take them to leave Korea. On their way, they run into a family who got into an accident and ask for a ride, but Jung-seok doesn't want to take the risk. He still drove away and left the family.Jung-seok's decision to leave the family is indeed a moral choice that is increasingly happening in zombie films, where someone is given the choice to help others at high risk or not help him not to increase unnecessary risk.While on the ship, Jung-seok again finds himself in a dilemma where his brother has to stay silent in a room full of zombies for accompanying his infected child. Couldn't do anything, she just looked at her and restrained her sister's husband from entering the room. Before we know how the situation will work, we are immediately thrown out four years after the tragedy.Even at that scene I was annoyed. As I know, in the world of Peninsula, if someone gets bitten it doesn't take long to turn them into zombies. But how can a person be bitten long before entering a ship that is very crowded and crowded and only changes when he is sitting on the ship?But maybe it doesn't matter because now we are in Hong Kong four years later, somehow or story. Jung-seok has become one of the underlings for a gang with Chul-min (Kim Do-yoon), Jung-seok's brother's husband. And they, along with two Koreans one of whom is a mother (again, somehow) were assigned by their boss to retrieve a truck filled with money from a peninsula in South Korea.Now they are back in South Korea, with a world that already looks like an apocalypse with cars scattered on the streets and destroyed buildings around them. Now his fourth task is to find the truck, call their friend who is waiting on the ship at a port, and return to Hong Kong. Sounds easy right?Now Peninsula feels different from Train to Busan, and that's something I can praise for his decision to try to come up with something new in terms of storytelling. Another thing that I can praise is how this film adds characteristics to their zombies so that it is unique from other zombie films. Like how they are very sensitive to light and sound, but can't see anything in the dark and therefore the majority of the film is different at night.Peninsula also feels smart in utilizing some of the characteristics of these zombies to produce some pretty exciting and interesting moments, such as how people in the city take advantage of car lights and also shoot flares to attract the attention of a bunch of zombies.And that's all I can appreciate in this film which has almost run for two hours. The characters in the film feel very mute and are only one-dimensional, don't have a unique personality and feel cliché. Peninsula does not have very strong dynamics and chemistry like the previous film. In Train to Busan, even the supporting characters also have roles that are quite deep and are able to offer enough emotions (especially the character Sang-hwa, played by Ma Dong-seok).In terms of the action itself, it is actually not inferior to Peninsula, even more so than before. However, my adrenaline is not so pumped to watch all the hamtam fights and shootouts in this film. Especially in the last 30 minutes, where the film turns into something like Fast and Furious or Mad Max. Yes, the last 30 minutes are filled with chase scenes between the main character who gets on a truck with a horde of wild soldiers who call themselves ""Unit 631"".I had a problem in that scene and the biggest obstacle that bothered me was: the CGI in this film was really bad and really bad. Every time we see a car moving, it is the result of a CGI. That's what results in every time we see a car moving, that car is going really unnaturally and moving impossible. The scene also feels accelerated, where the car can suddenly go quickly from a stopped position.Yes, I have a problem with that scene because with that scene Peninsula looks really want to be different from Train to Busan or other zombie films, he is willing to sacrifice his story for a bunch of CGI cars that move like it was made for a 3D animated film and the result is a splashy action but not. stressful.The final act, in which I didn't want to talk about it for fear of spoilers, also felt too forced to go on too long. Whether they want to evoke feelings of sadness, tension or new hope in us, their efforts fail because when the scene ends I just say to myself ""Finally"" and so when the film is over, I can only say ""Finally this film is over. """,Peninsula

It's a completely different type of movie. Really the only thing they have in common are the zombies, other than that it's completely different. Peninsula is more action, it's less intense and way less emotional. You aren't really attached to the characters and the zombies only play a supporting role, there isn't much emphasis to them.

Now that's a big problem for directors, people love the movie for a reason, and this movie was a sequel, so basically, the director should give that something that people have loved about the film. Peninsula though it was a sequel, I can't feel any vibe of the Train to Busan film. It seems it was a completely different movie.From my viewpoint, I think the movie would get higher ratings if they just pursue the story of the intro scene.What I also hate about part twos was the story was being forced, like in Peninsula, where people form some sort of systematic community, I know that was logical, but I don't want the story to have most of that, especially in zombie movies, that makes the narrative mediocre.The car chase was sick but still doesn't benefit the story.Some visuals also sucked, especially when they are trying to form a big crowd of zombies, but most of the visuals together with the cinematography's totality was pretty amazing.",Peninsula

319,billboykins,Refrain From Busan,7,7 September 2020,"Peninsula is not a direct sequel to Train To Busan. It doesn't connect to the original movie in any way and that includes character, pacing, style and story. I think Sang Ho-Yeon made a conscious decision to offer something different. Did it work? Well...yes and no. The opening 15 minutes are excellent and, had they kept that setting, Boat To Busan might have been a far more intriguing film. But the writer/director had other ideas and we get a Korean mob movie filled with characters that are never given enough on-screen time to be truly interesting.The relationship with the lead and his brother in law had the makings of something really poignant and this director does that incredibly well. But their collective trauma is never fully investigated and the events of the opening 15 minutes are lost under layers of bad CGI and unnecessary action sequences. I don't have a difficulty with the plot. 'Loot for grabs' would work just as well as 'Zombies on a train' if everything around it gelled but the movie is too fast and furious to allow for that.The final 15-20 minutes almost redeem Peninsula and, once again, Sang Ho-Yeon introduces themes of nobility, self sacrifice and there's a beautiful poignancy that we may have seen before but never as well done. So...a brilliant first 15 minutes, a suitably powerful ending but the filling in the sandwich lacked spice....and zombies. The biggest failing in Peninsula is the lack of dread. We could almost accept the lack of character development if the undead held center stage but, for much of the movie, they are reduced to the level of background noise and the director missed a trick on this one.I gave the film 7 stars as it was an entirely watchable and often engaging film but, regardless of not living up to its predecessor, Peninsula never lives up to its own potential. Boat To Busan would have been the better option unfortunately.",Peninsula

Movie relied too much on a LOT of CGI, there weren't enough zombies, most characters were unrelatable or barely acknowledged prior to their 'deaths' so I was confused whether I should be sad having no emotional attatchment to these guys. The end is ridiculous. They made english-speaking people really dumb and their lines were cheesy. The whole 'importance' of the movie is to get a van full of money. Literally. We also get a character who equals to a literal baby driver (reference to the hollywood movie). This movie felt incomplete and it felt like I was watching more of a ""World war Z"" spin-off. Originally, ""Train to busan"" captured so much positive attention because of their terrifying zombie threat, awesome character development and barely any slap of CGI so the movie felt more realistic and scary, tricking the mind how it could happen in real life. Whilst watching the second one (this) felt like watching a fantasy, action packed movie that wasn't too scary and failed to completely draw me in. I can't get sold on a CGI packed movie so easily. I didn't feel scared about the main threat which are and should be the zombies. I felt like the production was shooting this as an unrelated movie then slapped on the ""train to busan"" title for that extra money value. The script and plot could have been a LOT better. The actors themselves were actually amazing, it's literally more of a writing issue. I think it would have been better if this was sold as a standalone rather than a sequel to something magnificent and beautiful as ""Train to busan"". This sequel and the first one felt completely unrelated. Other than that, if you're not too picky about your movies and don't mind watching something that is nowhere near its first brilliant production, then this is the movie for you.",Peninsula

The first movie was an emotional roller coaster that got you invested in the characters. Every single close call felt meaningful because we actually wanted these people to survive.Peninsula almost manages to make the viewers feel the opposite because it commits some of the most flagrant horror/thriller movie cliches at the worst times: Our heroine leaves a person who she apparently KNOWS is a scumbag, on the floor to come full circle and become the final antagonist in the end. Our hero apparently has perfect accuracy to shoot out a spotlight on a moving vehicle but frequently forgets he has a gun in his hands when there are enemy vehicles driving perfectly alongside them.Don't even get me started on the final scene when the little girl and old man apparently have to be standing out in the open to distract the Captain with the remote control car. You really couldn't do that from behind cover?I always consider a horror movie to be garbage whenever the characters start to behave irrationally just to push the plot forward and this movie is as guilty as they come.

Simple story, the pacing is great and the ending is good.This year, they released a sequel to Train to Busan, which is took place after 4 years, but none of the characters from the first film return. Which is completely different character but same universe.Sadly, Peninsula is not as great as Train to Busan because the story is so much like you see in Hollywood. The story is about a crime boss used Koreans as mercenary to take a large sum of money in Korea, but they failed horribly when they got ambushed by a group of survivor where they got abandoned during the outbreak.The movie slowly became Mad Max during the third act, where all the survivors are chasing the main character.Like I said, the movie lost its touch because I believe most audience come here to watch human vs zombies, not human vs human, we got tired with this storyline, man.And again, I just it 6/10 because the action sequence was good, some of the characters was great especially the main lead.Ps: the character Jane was so cringeworthy.

I visited the theater with no expectations but with merely a curiosity. However, I came back surprised by the even better perfection and the message that I had expected. If anyone plans to go out to the theater after being long-term stayed in the house due to pandemic, I would like to recommend it with confidence. I think it will be the first 5 million, or seven million-viewer Korean movies this year. The reason that I feel seems that the theme of this is quite in line with the situation of the corona pandemic.
Basically, I had little interest in, and no affection for Soup-opera drama, which we Korean have called it ""Shinppa: appealing for the excessive emotion) movie,"" which means overly focused on sad emotion for popularity. After the Corona crisis epidemic, I am once again thinking about the fundamental reasons and causes of this kind of Film. The distinct but essential setting of zombie movies usually focuses on the main character's choice when his/her loved ones, family friends, and relatives turn into zombies or are on the verge of change. If they're all dead, the movie becomes apocalypse movie, and if they're in the early stages, the movie's main atmosphere would be horror. As we already know, all zombie movies have already used up every setting that can come out. What are they going to do now?
2.
Director Yeon Sang-ho, however, comes up with this ""Shinppa"" in a genius-like manner. The theme of his previous movie ""Road to Busan"" was also used this 'excessive Emotion"" in his primary way to deal with zombies. It seems to be shouting to the viewers like this. ""Don't give up and bring your family back from hell!"" ""If your lover and your family member die, you're also already dead."" The foundation of the ""Shinppa"" is family love. It should be distinguished from family-oriented selfishness and nepotism. What is the power that supports society? Is it a reason or emotion? Isn't it based on love that goes beyond reason to save someone in danger?
It is not a crucial factor to make people cry or not while watching the movie. But the movie seems to convey the message that the reason we live is neither money and honor but to protect and embrace people who live close to us. If we are the person always think and decide logically when we are plunged into the situation of survival games, the way to survive would be not so difficult and complicated. Just sacrificing your colleges quickly. And cutting off the limbs one by one is the best choice no matter what. We've seen enough of the situation through the pandemics of Covid-19. Why do we live? How to cope with it. Director Yeon has made a fascinating zombie movie. It will be a worldwide hit.
Peninsula, I strongly recommend the movie.

Not as emotional as the previous Train to Busan, in fact it just gives me a totally different vibe.I'm not saying it's bad, but I'm a fan of the Train to Busan that's why I was having high expectations on this one, sadly it wasn't as good as what I was expecting.",Peninsula
400,ttj-26038,"Definitely not as good as the first, but we can see some effort to make them related.",8,18 July 2020,"Train to Busan 1 was about poverty, and the spread of the vicious result of it (you can think of the zombie infection as communism, revolution, rioting or just unemployability).The idea of a father sacrificing himself for the future and safety of his daughter is not only see at the ending, but mentioned by the muscular side character Dong Seok Ma while in the washroom with the main character. Most parents have that mentality of ""I may not have had the opportunity to succeed, but I want to provide a chance for my children to do so"", even parents who were once rich but suffered financial crisis. (Such as after economic crashes like in COVID-19)TTB1's main zombie-related concept that let it stand out is 1. Claustrophobia and 2. Innovative unarmed combat (no guns).Now, about TTB2, I can see the metaphor is brought to the next level... ""If you were to get out of your poor country, would you be willing to use crime to profiteer of the chaos?"" The mother character said, all it took was some change to finally get someone to come over.Then there's the sacrifice for the future generation metaphor. It's shown again by the grandfather figure (commander) who wishes to ""get his family out of this hell"" . The difference in this scene is the daughter figure says ""but I was happy here (together)"" which reminds me of the movie Parasite, where there is a difference between having your family together but poor, and having your family separated but you're able to get out of it. (Spoiler... Although in parasite, they don't even get out of it, which is even sadder)Then there's another twist from TTB1 in that it was necessary for a parent to completely to sacrifice oneself, but in TTB2 the mother thought it was necessary but it may not actually be that way. So in the metaphor, that would mean parents in poverty think they have to sacrifice everything for their children, but it might be possible to leave poverty together.Next, let's look at the zombie related concepts in TTB2.
1. Claustrophobia. There are multiple scenes that depict this feeling in this movie, for example in the ship, in the 2 minute survival arena, in the villain's car when he is surrounded and in the Hong Kong gangster's ship.
(The survival arena is also a recurring theme, as the same song is sang by the Captain when the soldiers are being overrun)What about the 2nd concept, being unarmed?
I think the guns were quite unnecessary in this movie, and the action was too 'clean', such as the main character's perfect aim and plot armor.However, they do show a lot of unique ways to fight the zombies, such as diversions, driving a car, concealing vision with smoke grenades and blocking the path with doors. Many people talk about the excessive use of guns, but there are actually plentiful examples of using other means to handle zombies, such as sound, fireworks, flares, car lights, neon-lighted advertisement vans and humans wearing lights.So, the core concepts of the Train to Busan franchise weren't forgotten, just developed... And onto my next point is why I wouldn't give the movie 10 stars, but only 8.

404,liangjeremy,Spoilers Ahead!!!,7,21 July 2020,"A typical yet enjoyable action movie. Peninsula, a standalone movie that is set in the same world as Train To Busan makes you feel disappointed yet amazed (at least for me). It's a fun movie overall but when compared to the first , it does not live up to Train to Busan and the hype. There were many flaws in the movie like for example, the time it took for the infected to turn into zombies in the intro and more. The side characters lacked development and so when they died , it wasn't very emotional . The CGI in the action scenes had visible mistakes which took the intense feelings away. However, I do have to credit Yeon's idea of the wasteland of Seoul. It's quite beautiful and yet familiar for the locals. The movie showcases some beautiful scenes of the city which could be made into posters. I was looking forward to the antagonists but was disappointed by how silly they were, I found it surprising that it was easier for me to hate the antagonist from Train To Busan than Peninsula. I don't know if Yeon was purposely hiring actors with terrible English, but some of the actors' English (except Kang Dong Won and the Americans) were so bad that you couldn't even comprehend what they said if you didn't have subtitles on. The movie really had potential with those apocalyptic looking buildings and places but the main story wasn't executed perfectly. Though, I was still satisfied with a bit of realism Yeon added like, the Hong Kongers discriminating Koreans which gives them reason to return to the peninsula. I just wished Yeon focused on story and not the action. Overall, I think this movie will alright if you haven't watched Train to Busan or didn't compare it to Peninsula. It's a movie a family can enjoy together. But if you are comparing with Train to Busan, it does not live up to it but keeps the emotion and action flowing.",Peninsula

406,jesuisbanan,Forget the First Movie and Watch It.,9,21 July 2020,"Why on earth would I tell you to forget the first movie to watch a sequel?
Because it's irrelevant... just like the pre-sequel (that not many know about.)It truly is, this movie will have nothing to do with any of the original cast members and you will not find out what happens to the young girl (Su-an) after they get to Busan. At best you can assume they were shipped out among the refugees.In the beginning of this movie they cover what happens in the first and give you the setting of the world so you will not be required to watch the first one to understand the second. With that in mind if you don't think about the first movie or expect the same aspects then all and all it was a very exciting and well done action movie.
It has its flaws:The car scenes- A lot of reviews had an issue with the car scenes and I can understand that it felt like an apocalyptic fast n furious. That bothered me as well but I get what they were trying to do there. Because with those kinds of zombies you would need some sort of means for transportation and you would have to be very skilled about it, it's not like the train system would be running anymore for your convenience. Still I would have liked the graphics to have been toned down a bit but it wasn't like they were going to have zombie fighting scenes in their cars like the on the train so they were trying to bring excitement to the movie where they would be obviously lacking.The timeline- I didn't see many people mentioning this complaint so I'll point it out. The concept of being four years later is highly unlikely not when the zombies themselves had a major design flaw at night. The entire world wouldn't rest at ease with an entire country infested with zombies, blocked off or not. There would have been drones dropping bombs or some means of dropping the infected in numbers. I could have easily been convinced with a year difference, having those with connections trying to get their money out before the government executes it's plan. But four years without the entire world being infected and absolutely nothing being done about the zombies, it's just too large of a gap.The lack in zombie action- Here's the thing I like a good zombie movie with zombie's being the main issue like anybody else. However, the fighting between the zombies being little to none is not unreasonable. If you were hoping for the action of the first movie it's just not going to happen. We're talking four years later, at this point if you are still alive you know how to stay alive. The zombie threat isn't as present as the threat of those who also know how to stay alive because they are either thieves or trying to seize power in a lawless land. (As pointed out in the walking dead multiple times)The lack of day light scenes- Again this refers back to my comment, that after four years, you know it is only safe at night. Still, I like zombie movies that can be brought in the daylight hours. I love when a horror movie can still make an impact even without cover of darkness. Setting it four years later with hide outs and safe places to stay in the daylight hours it just couldn't be accomplished in this movie and that was disappointing.^That's just a few of my main issues with the movie but that doesn't stop me from easily adding this movie in the top list of my favored zombie movies. I like how Korean films betray zombies like these rabid animals instead of walking corpses. If they make another I would love to see it as well.Also if you haven't watched Seoul Station, it's an animated movie that I would suggest you watch at your own discretion. The characters in the movie are not very pleasant and it's hard to attach to any of them. There are no heart warming moments and no touching sacrifices made (Something which at least the second movie did try to accomplish.)
It's nothing like the Train to Busan and honestly I think that watching Seoul Station before this movie, gave me a better understanding that these movies are only sharing the same zombie apocalypse, nothing more.",Peninsula

If you are into action this movie definitely will have you on edge although the English voice acting sucked, It still left me with the same feelings as the first one. A masterpiece. I was satisfied with it. This film also shows how money can lead people to do the worst and be completely selfish even in a time where everyone should be looking out for each other.

And not to mention, the plot is also half-baked, and lost the charm of the original.i'm sorry, but considering that its predecessor was a hit, i really had big expectations for this, but all i got was an irrelevant story line. i was even excited when they announced a second part; but who am i kidding, what can you expect from sequels of big films...?",Peninsula
413,sarahalwayswitty,I loved it,8,8 August 2020,"Lots of reviews talk about how it sucks in comparison to the first one and that it's too much Mad Max or Fast and Furious. But I'm here to say that I enjoyed it. Yes, there were car races that were insanely awesome, even if the CGI was noticeable at some parts, and yes some parts of the movie were predictable, but does that make it a bad movie? To critics yes, but who ever trusts the critics? I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and I personally saw nothing wrong with the acting of anyone on screen. It's true that there weren't many zombies and they weren't super threatening like they were in the first movie. It's true that there was more Human on Human conflict rather than Human on Zombie, but I still enjoyed the movie.My favourite part would have to be at the end when he actually went back to get the woman and didn't die. That might sound a bit odd, but when you compare it to the first one where the father died at the end, I was gutted. This time I was so relieved that he got onto the Helicopter that I almost cried.But all in all, I think I would recommend this movie to those who haven't seen the first one so that they have nothing to compare it with, and to those who haven't really seen many Korean movies or movies in other languages, because like others have commented, it's got a very Hollywood Blockbuster feel to it.",Peninsula

This film unfortunately doesn't live up to its predecessors at all. At a push, the first 30 minutes are acceptable - nothing great, but they do provide some of the claustrophobic zombie elements of TTB. We are introduced to the 2 child characters, which I didn't actually mind, as it felt as though the film was self-aware and not taking itself overly seriously. After the first 30 minutes however, the film plummets to rock bottom. Other reviews have compared it to a knock-off Fast & Furious and that's exactly what it feels like, but with Playstation 2 level CGI graphics. These CGI monstrosities go on for WAY too long with mindless car chases (and ooooh look, those two cars flipped over, wow!). The final fifteen minutes of the film honestly felt like a joke, as we went from Fast & Furious to the most over-emotional K-Drama of all time (complete with awful acting and randomly sped-up scenes set to an overly dramatic music score).

So Dong Won character fought to the zombies for the last time to save the eomma of the two kids. I love the ending. It's more powerful than the opening and middle part. Those parts were all dark and bored to watch. At least the ending part is great. But I think it is a 7/10 for me.

It does not fit at all. Its so odd and cringe. I don't know if they were sloppy/just pushed this out the door perhaps they did not understand how it would be perceived by an western audience.Character exposition was horrible. The kids drive a car like its a toy and its so cheezy. The movie is all in your face about it too. With 0 character or t in cheek. The movie takes itself way to serious for what it is.A bad direct to video c-grade action flick, void of any humour.There's like way to few zombie scenes. The focus are on these military renegades. Like whooo cares. The plot is so basic and interesting character dialog is 0.The cgi is crazy bad. Feels like an 2004 eastern European home brew cgi movie. It's for tik tok brains and kids. The cars handle in a way that's totally unnecessary and looks void of physics. It's so over the top.

460,samgonzalez92,Better? I can't say but it is different,8,31 October 2020,"I gave the first film an eight the same as this. The first film was a fairly generic zombie film but with compelling characters. This film does not have the compelling characters and really sacrifices the character development for a fresh fast paced story. This film feels in no way generic and it kept me guessing. It was tense and unpredictable. The action was top notch. My only critique was the lack of character development. In the first film I felt really connected to the characters and cared a lot about their outcomes, unfortunately I did not feel the same way about this film. I did get lost in the overall story tho. If there's one thing TV series have over films, it's the time to develop every aspect of the story. This film sacrificed character development for story and unpredictability. Its wild and unpredictable, the tense moments when you don't know what's next more than compensate for the underdeveloped characters. You will be guessing til the end. It's a must watch if you enjoyed the first film but don't want to see the first film over again. The two films combined make a well balanced overall experience.",Peninsula

I can understand the bad CGI or weird acting, but why is this movie thinks it's telling a good (or consistent) story? Things are ridiculous from start to finish, and it feels like a bad copy of a Fast & Furious movie. And at the end, they try to create some drama, but you will not be able to hold your laugh.

463,jiajinpin,A beautiful genre film,9,15 July 2020,"""Peninsula"" is the spiritual sequel to 2016 smash hit ""Train to Busan"", and it's a surprising official selection for 2020 Cannes Film Festival.The film is an entertaining vehicle that never stops. I was at the edge of my seat from the beginning till the end. It's a beautiful genre film.
There're car chases, gunfire, explosions, and hand-to-hand combats. The cinematography and sound design are very well crafted.It's thrilling and exciting, making me think of some greatest action films in history, ""True Lies"", ""Die Hard"", and ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" especially.Just when you think 2019 ""Parasite"" is the highest achievement of Korean cinema, ""Peninsula"" pushes the boundary further.",Peninsula
464,The_Gothik_,Very disappointed,5,2 September 2020,"As an avid viewer of Korean movies, I can say this movie was very disappointing... This a classical case of non Hollywood movies trying to please the wider crowd. A forced non emotional movie...The first scenes set the mood for the movie. From the bad acting of the non Korean actors to those lame lines.. oh goodness.
I have to confess I just finished the movie cause deep down I had some hope... It's a Korean movie after all... But it is actually not.As many others reviews have pointed out this is just like a fast and furious movie... Has no soul, a lot of plot holes, no character development. It got boring and made me sleepy.Is short they should had tryed to make a Korean movie for the Korean viewers and maybe, they would just win us over like in Train to Busan.",Peninsula
465,Orgasmo-Erectus,Absolute Garbage *AVOID THIS MOVIE*,1,17 July 2020,"Allowing this movie to air on the big screen, is an outright insult to the viewers. This is a half-assed, textbook case of milking a successful movie (Train to Busan) into a poor ""sequel"".I can write a book about the plot holes, inconsistensies and the movies being impossible for the viewers to suspend their disbelief to take it seriously.There are extended segments of painfuly edgy teen/toddler duo. Where they exchange one liners and run over infected in a ""stylish"" way. All the while they slam into other cars while drifting and grind against building/cars anime style. All the while, without sustaining as much as a scratch to the car's paint, and not even a splash of blood...Even better, nearly 1/4th of the movie is composed of these EXTREMELY poorly made CGI sections and car chases (yay?). For some reason these scenes dominate the majority of the movie.This is all so (masterfully ?) Integrated with an overwhelming amount of EXTENDED ""sad"" slow motion shots of ""dramatic"" situation about underdeveloped characters that you couldn't care less about, dying or ""almost"" dying but being saved at the last second. Rambo-style by the invincible main protagonist.This movie is utter trash, unbelievably so. I can't recall the last time where i had such an overwhelming urge, to storm out of the theater, and demand a refund.Do your a huge favour and dodge this bullet that i took for you. AVOID THIS MOVIE. Don't worry, the name aside, this movie has NOTHING to do with Train to Busan. So you are not missing out.",Peninsula

If you believe low imdb ratings and bad reviews then it's an uninspired pandering to Hollywood action and drama. Don't take those at face value! It totally is but it's hilarious. I had a real good time watching it. Weird mix of Fast and Furious, World War Z, Escape From NY, Mad Max Fury Road, and typical modern age fast and cgi laden zombie and car chasing stuff. It's the WAY it's done that shines, not the ingredients per se. The drama when certain pivotal people die is ludicrous cringe I give the critics that. But everything else which is also over the top really is fun to watch! Some scenes are fast paced and well choreographed and remind of Mad Max Fury Road. Other scenes are really funny and adorable, like the first time we meet the two kids during the car chase. The scenes in the survivor camp and the zombie arena remind a bit of Escape From NY, humor included. Overall the movie is entertaining on so many levels and never just drags along.",Peninsula

478,noractaa,Am I stupid?,10,25 November 2020,"I love Train to Busan! I can't watch it without feeling sadness, joy, hate, and fear. Is it wrong to say I loved this one just as much. Is it really the Last of Us Part 2 for people? In fact, I love TLOUP2 just much as the first game. People hold great movies in such high regard. I'm the same way (Don't you touch Back to the Future!), but what I think we have here is a Jurassic Park situation. Now I'm not Korean nor do I speak their language, but isn't putting out sequal to a new story up to the vision of the writer or director if not sometimes both. Steven Spielberg wanted to make Jurassic Park The Lost World feel different than the first movie. Does that make it a bad sequal or an idea that might take time to sink in. After seeing Jack and Jill (You know the one) and then going to watch God Father, I can say that I've seen my fair share of great and bad films, and some in-between. Yes there's bad cgi, some wacky moments and not much character development, but that doesn't mean there isn't anything under the surface. I do not hate this movie. I love this movie! It probably helps too that I avoided all trailers or other Hollywood type stuff. I guess I'm trying to say...is it really the worst movie to you.

I feel like the rating would be higher if this was just another zombie movies. and not the follow up to a masterpiece.we can feel the lack of budget in some scene (the light during nightime is one of the worst, it is obvious that the movie was shot during daytime and color corected to make it look like nightime)
But the action scene are really fun to watch and the story, even if the scenario will not change your life, flows nicely without too many pause which let you enjoy the ride.Not movie of the year but the movie does not deserve all the 1/10 rating that I saw on IMDB.",Peninsula

This was a fun enough zombie flick, a couple of ropey bits of cgi but all in all pretty fun.
I found the acting from the two young girls to be excellent, the lead was good and the villains were a bit on the side of pantomime.
Overall not too shabby but it's real downfall is that it had to follow in the footsteps of Last Train to Busan. Sadly it's tough to follow a stone wall classic and without the claustrophobic premise of being trapped on a train it was always going to struggle to live up to its predecessor. At times I loved this, but it does seem a little hindered by the Hollywood trope of sequels trying to make everything bigger which is not always better.",Peninsula

If you want less CGI you need a much bigger budget which I doubt they had.Anyway I thought it was a solid movie, ok, not the sequel I wanted, but if you treat it as a standalone movie it was really good.

This movie still got the K-Drama vibe but lacked the thriller and shock value of the first one - even for a tiny bit. Nada. It's like they tried too hard to appeal to western viewers and ended up producing a film that the Hollywood fanatics themselves would stomp on. It was just horrible. But I expected too much because you know, 4 years from Train to Busan!I suggest that if you don't want anything to do with the first movie and want some human to human plot with zombies on the side then you can probably sit through this movie. I just lingered on hoping something interesting will happen but the whole miserable 2 hours just failed me. Really disappointed and sad that they weren't able to live up to the first movie. I hope we can all just pretend this movie never happened and wish they will make a part 3 which is more connected or has the feels of the first one.
