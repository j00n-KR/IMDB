0,MartinHafer,Mind-blowing CGI and stunts....and okay story.,7,14 July 2018,"I remember seeing the previews for ""Zatura: A Space Adventure"" back in 2005 and thinking that the premise for this one is pretty much ""Jumanji""....which it is. While not a sequel, the game clearly is a reworking of the original story. So, if you like one, you'll likely enjoy the other.When the story begins, a divorced dad (Tim Robbins) is trying to work as his bratty kids are being...well...brats. Eventually, after Dad leaves, the youngest finds a game called ""Zathura"" and when he starts playing it, the game becomes real. Suddenly the house is transported to outer space and the only conceivable way to get back is to, apparently, complete the game with his annoying and occasionally hateful brother. In the process, they meet an astronaut, a murderous robot and meat-eating lizard creatures.The visuals in this film are mind-blowing...particularly for 2005. So much CGI was used...and it looks real. In fact, the CGI and stunts are second to none. As for the story, it's decent but has two minor problems--you really hate the three siblings and the story will be less interesting to adults and is too violent and scary for younger kids. Worth seeing with your kids.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
1,TheLittleSongbird,Simply great family entertainment,9,23 May 2011,"I have often seen this compared to Jumanji, just for the record I love them both equally. About Zathura:A Space Adventure, as a family movie it is truly excellent. True, the role of the sister is rather clichéd, but a lot makes you not worry so much about it. Jon Favreau's direction is excellent, and the sense of childlike wonder featured so prominently here is delightful. There is a witty script, a highly imaginative story and a great fix of fun, scares and poignancy, it was wonderful to hear Frank Oz as the voice of the robot, Jonah Boo and Josh Hutcherson make a great duo and Dax Sheppard's astronaut provides the touching moment of the film, that of the revelation of his true identity. What made Zathura:A Space Adventure so good especially were the fantastic production values, a soundtrack that fitted perfectly with the film's tone and the gripping action. Overall, just great. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Zathura - A Space Adventure
2,bkoganbing,"Not Over The Rainbow, But Out In The Galaxy",9,5 July 2010,"Bearing no small resemblance to The Wizard Of Oz, Zathura is a really imaginative kid's film that can be enjoyed by adults also. There's also a nice moral lesson in there about family and the value of cherishing one's blood relations.I'm sure that every kid in the audience identified with Josh Hutcherson and Jonah Bobo the eternally quarreling brothers. Even a year at that age makes a lot of difference in outlook and how fast one is growing up. That's what's happened to these two as they fight just as me and my siblings did back in the day. They drive divorced father Tim Robbins a bit bonkers. They also don't do any good for their older sister Kristen Stewart still years away from her encounters with the undead.The younger one, Jonah Bobo, finds an old board game called Zathura: A Space Adventure. Once they start playing the house they live in becomes a space vehicle. It doesn't just go over the border, but out into the galaxy where the boys encounter all kinds of adventure and discover they need and love each other more than they realize. Young Ms. Stewart who was catching a few winks waiting for her date to pick her up also is caught in the madness and quite frankly she's of little help to her siblings.Zathura contains some nice imaginative special effects not the least of which are a robot that needs reprogramming and some hideous creatures called Zorgons who eat all kinds of flesh all over the galaxy.But first and foremost Zathura is a nice family film that I can't recommend highly enough for young audiences.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
3,Leofwine_draca,Space junk,3,13 January 2016,"ZATHURA: A SPACE ADVENTURE is nothing more than an outer space version of JUMANJI, with aliens and space stuff replacing jungle creatures. It's a film singularly devoid of imagination, despite the outlandish premise, and I can honestly said I had more fun with an ultra-low budget film like THE DAY TIME ENDED (in which a family's home is attacked by stop motion aliens) than this mega budget offering.The director behind this fare is Jon Favreau, who makes a typically soulless production that focuses on special effects over decent scripting or performances (anyone who's seen the first two IRON MAN films will be familiar with his work). A couple of annoying kids (including the eminently hateable Josh Hutcherson) play a board game that makes their house travel into the depths of outer space, where they embark on the usual CGI augmented adventures, i.e. lots of stuff is destroyed or blown up.Kristen Stewart (TWILIGHT) is cast as the older sister and, somewhat bizarrely, as the film's eye candy, parading around in skimpy underwear throughout, even though she would have only been 14 when this was filmed. Say what you will about the sexualisation of young actresses in Hollywood...A tired Tim Robbins takes the role of 'token Hollywood actor', but the emphasis is on the CGI throughout. Most of it isn't bad at all, but the structure of the narrative is such that the film's action is severely limited in scope and much of the running time has to rest on the shoulders of the two young actors, who just don't cut the mustard.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
4,SnoopyStyle,"Fun, lots of Fun",7,13 September 2013,"Director Jon Favreau uses the same concept as Jumanji. A board game comes alive when it gets played. Danny (Jonah Bobo) and Walter (Josh Hutcherson) are two battling brothers who find an old mechanical board game called Zathura, and they start to play it. Only every move they make sends something crazy to happen. Their entire house gets launched into outer space. They, along with their sister Lisa (Kristen Stewart), must finish the game and return home.Sure it's derivative of the original Jumanji. However I think I like this one a little slightly bit better. Having kids play the game just seems more compelling, and more dangerous, and more fun. Oh did I say it's fun. It's a lot of fun.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
5,boblipton,A Good Kid's Movie,6,22 November 2020,"Two brothers, one ten, one six, fight all the time because that's what brothers do. One of them finds a game in the basement, a science-fiction version of Candyland with event cards, and soon they find themselves and their house in deepest space.After the success of 1995's JUMANJI, author/artist Chris van Allsburg's follow-up book was turned into a follow-up movie. While it lacked the wild comedy that Robin Williams brought to the earlier movie, it's visually a much better movie; director Jon Favreau avoided CGI when practical effects could be made to work, and Stan Winston supervised the props and monsters. I think the script is much better put together, and the supporting characters include Tim Robbins as their father, Kristen Stewart as their sister, and Dax Roberts as the Astronaut. It's a very watchable science-fantasy movie.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
6,Prismark10,The Space Game,6,2 March 2014,"This is a charming family adventure of two young squabbling brothers causing chaos whilst staying with their father (Tim Robbins.)When they are left alone the younger one finds a board game called Zathura and ends up in a real life space adventure with meteor showers, heat attracted lizards, a rampaging robot and a rescued astronaut whilst their house floats in space and their sister is frozen.The film is about co-operation. The siblings do better when they work together and the rescued astronaut is key in bringing them together. A young Kristen Stewart plays the older sister whose part is largely redundant and seems more livelier when she is actually frozen!Director Jon Favreau brings a Spielberg like charm to the story and gets the best out of the two young actors and the special effects are very good. Co-writer David Koepp, famous for the Jurassic Park films, brings a familiar beat to his plotting. He really should trademark the predictability of his scripting with only the astronaut's unveiling at the end being a mild surprise.Despite similarities to Jumanji, it is still a good film to watch as a family and younger children will find this enthralling.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
7,lee_eisenberg,"Jumanji, help!",2,15 January 2014,"OK, so ""Zathura: A Space Adventure"" is based on a book that was a sequel to ""Jumanji"". I've read ""Jumanji"" but not the sequel. Anyone who's read ""Jumanji"" knows that the part about Robin Williams's character was not in the book; had the movie followed the book exactly, it would've only been a few minutes long.So about this movie. Like the former movie, it depicts a board game that brings about danger every time that someone takes a turn. More accurately, the movie seems like a retread of the former movie. One can see a correlation between some of the characters in each movie. But that's where the similarity ends. You see, ""Jumanji"" is a fun movie no matter what age you are, while ""Zathura"" is aimed at elementary-age children. I wish that they'd looked at where the game originally came from, as ""Jumanji"" did.In conclusion, this movie is only worth seeing for the early appearances of Kristen Stewart and Josh Hutcherson (Peeta Mellark in the ""Hunger Games"" franchise).",Zathura - A Space Adventure
8,jboothmillard,Zathura: A Space Adventure,8,19 May 2011,"From director Jon Favreau (Elf, Iron Man), I remember hearing the title from somewhere, and I found out it was a family film with a similar sounding concept to Jumanji, but in space, I was certainly willing to give it a go. Basically Danny (Jonah Bobo) and Walter (Josh Hutcherson) are two brothers who hardly get on with each other or their sister Lisa (Twilight's Kristen Stewart), they haven't been living in their house for very long but their Dad (Tim Robbins) leaves them by themselves. When he is put in the basement Danny explores it and under the stair case finds an old mechanical two player board game called Zathura: A Space Adventure, and thinking it looks like good fun starts playing it. It works by turning a winder and getting a certain amount of spaces to move, and then receiving a card giving a clue for what is going to happen, whether moving their rocket backwards or forwards, or in the common case something happening. When the first move causes the house to crumble and be shot into deep space Walter joins in as well to play, and every move they play seems to create more space based trouble for them to get out of. This includes cryogenically freezing their sister, having a Robot (John Alexander, voiced by Frank Oz) try to attack them, have aliens known as Zorgans abduct them and much more, but the brothers slowly cooperate to complete the game and end it all. In the middle of playing, they receive a card which brings in an Astronaut (Without a Paddle's Dax Shepard) to join them in their journey, he agrees to help them complete the game which he himself played too, and a bemused Lisa joins as well. After going through a lot with deadly aliens and explosive incidents, they get nearer to the end, and the big revelation is that the Astronaut is an older Walter, and he gets his wish to have his brother, Danny, back. In the end, Danny wins the game, reaching the end of Zathura, all the space based things disappear and everything goes back to normal, and Walter, Danny and Lisa agree to forget it ever happened. Also starring Derek Mears as Lead Zorgon. The two young stars make a great duo, Shepard does well as their new friend from the cosmos, Stewart and Robbins do alright with their time, but of course the real star of the film is the gripping action and the amazing special effects, a fantastic fantasy adventure to be enjoyed by kids and adults. Very good!",Zathura - A Space Adventure

10,BA_Harrison,Zathanji.,6,18 October 2008,"When bickering brothers Danny (Jonah Bobo) and Walter (Josh Hutcherson) begin to play Zathura, a mysterious, clockwork board game discovered in the basement of their father's house, they are transported to outer space and cannot return to Earth until one of them wins. With each roll of the dice (well, the clockwork equivalent of a dice, anyway), the boys face new and terrible dangers, including meteor showers, a malevolent robot, and attacks from flesh-eating alien lizards.First things first: Zathura is not a sequel to Jumanji. It has none of that film's stars, none of the same characters, and does not feature the Jumanji board game. It is, however, 'from the world of Jumanji'; in other words, made by producers who obviously felt that there was more mileage to be had from the magical board game concept, and who decided to recycle the idea.Unfortunately, despite featuring more advanced special effects and a sci-fi angle that offers plenty of scope for more imaginative hazards, this film is a far less successful venture than its jungle themed predecessor. Suffering from annoying characters played by less talented actors, a poorly thought out plot (that, although set in the endless expanse of space, still sees the boys confined to their house), and a confusing 'time twist' ending that requires further explanation to fully understand (either via the DVD commentary, or by searching the internet), Zathura is lacking in too many ways to be a wholly enjoyable adventure.Next time the producers want to bring us another story 'from the world of Jumanji', couldn't we just have Jumanji 2? (preferably with Dunst, Williams, and the return of those mischievous monkeys!).5.5 out of 10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
11,studioAT,Good enough without being spectacular,4,16 March 2020,"A film that's included by some on the 'Jumanji' series, and not by others.It's essentially Jumanji in space, but actually ends up being a decent film, with some nice special effects and performances.I don't personally consider it to be part of the 'Jumanji' series, but that's just my opinion.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
12,dbborroughs,"Good enough to see, but also to make you wish it were some how better.",7,20 November 2005,"Based on a book by Chris Van Allsburg, Zathura tells the story of two brothers who start playing the game Zathura and soon find themselves trapped in space. Yes, boys and girls this is more Jumanji like adventures, but in space instead of in the wilds of darkest Africa. I'm a fan of the mad cap romp of the first film which continuously bent reality in very silly ways. Granted the earlier film had a plot that was a bit of a mess, but it was still fun to watch the actors go through their paces. I'm not sure what to make of this sequel.While I can admire the the film for being tightly plotted and for being more together than Jumanji, and while I think the set pieces (and the monsters) are wonderful, I think the film suffers from two problems, first the film doesn't have the absolute sense of danger and anything can happen that made Jumanji work despite its flaws. We know (AND THIS IS A SPOILER IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN JUMANJI) that in the end all will be right with the world and it will be as if nothing happened.(END SPOILER) This lack of tension works against the film since we can't be too frightened that something awful is going to happen, because we know the ending. There is no edge to things because we're just waiting for the inevitable. The other problem with this movie, is that despite the violence and destruction, this is a family movie. There is nothing wrong with that, except that the film feels like its trying to be all ages friendly, which unfortunately means that its trying to do something more than just tell a story, its trying to tell the story in a certain way, which is to make it acceptable to everyone. I dislike that. Film makers should just try to tell the story and not try to gear the film to everyone in the audience since you end up losing some one by trying to reach everyone (and in a case like this there really isn't anything offensive that could get anyone in trouble) The best movies are movies and not movies for a group, or all groups.Still this is a good movie, that looks great on the big screen. It has wonderful set pieces, cool monsters, and a sense of fun thats worth seeing. Definitely better in pieces than as a whole, Zathura is worth a bargain matinée, or a rental on cable. 7 out of 10 for the pieces, 6 out of 10 as a whole.",Zathura - A Space Adventure

14,view_and_review,Jumanji pt. 2,6,21 December 2006,"""Zathura"" could have easily been titled Jumanji 2, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. ""Zathura"", a movie about a game in which you actually experience what the cards read, had ""Jumanji"" written all over it. There were some subtle differences: the setting was in space and the incidents that occurred to the children was based upon the card they pulled. Personally, I tend to dislike movies with bratty kids and this one had three of them. But, the adventures they went through were interesting and I thought Dax Shepard (from ""Without a Paddle"") really livened up the movie. I don't think this movie could have held its own with just the two little boys and an older yet absent sister the entire time.It was a fun, adventurous movie; nothing too spectacular, but it was good.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
15,view_and_review,Jumanji In Space,6,18 December 2017,"It is impossible to watch Zathura without drawing comparisons to Jumanji. A game in which the players experience what the game card reads. Although Zathura is very much like Jumanji, Jumanji was much better. The only real advantage Zathura had over Jumanji was the CGI.Two feuding siblings with divorced parents discover the game Zathura. One of the two opens it and takes a turn when the other refused to play. Well, once the game begins it must be played until completion so the older brother was forced to play the game.They are faced with one death defying situation after another if they don't kill each other first. The two brothers were constantly bickering and fighting so much that it became headache inducing. When they weren't at each other's throats it was a fun movie.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
16,neil-476,Another winner!,8,28 April 2013,"Two young brothers have to put their poor relationship to one side when the game Zathura turns out to have unexpected consequences.Zathura is a sequel to Jumanji in that both films - based on novels by Chris van Allsburg - concern board games which involve the players in fantastic real-life consequences, teach them something about themselves and, when finished, reset everything to where it was before (except for the life lessons, which remain).Where the game in Jumanji was African in nature, Zathura, as per the film's sub-title, is a space adventure (don't expect the physics to make sense, the adventure works via magic rather than science). The hazards encountered are well executed, the story is exciting, the house in which the adventure takes place is full of character, and the film is as good as family entertainment as its predecessor.I didn't care for Jonah Bobo as the younger brother, but Josh Hutcherson was excellent as older brother Walter, over-competitive, jealous and resentful towards his younger brother. Kristen Stewart puts in a decent mid-teen performance as the older sister: the sulks were only partly required.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
17,siderite,Jumanji 2 this is NOT,6,29 January 2006,"This felt like a low budget filmed play. An entire movie that happens in a house with 6 actors (one of them being the robot) and some CGI. The story is planned as being a child story, therefore all the characters are ridiculously clichés that make irrational and absurd choices.The father (played by Tim Robbins) is, of course, the best played character. It has a few scenes at the start and the end of the movie. Why Tim Robbins would play such a meaningless part is beyond me.The little male brother is a business manager in becoming. Obnoxious, spoiled, refusing to take responsibilities for his egotistic and stupid actions.The big brother acts in a way at the start and in a completely different way in the end of the movie, thus invalidating the effect that the whole experience should have had on him.The bitchy big sister plays a part almost as big (and intelligent) as the robot. Even the zorgons are really dumb.In the end you feel like you've been watching a cheap remake of Jumanji and you've been ripped off. This is not even a bad movie, as bad movies get plenty of ridicule and talk. This doesn't even deserve mentioning.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
18,Smells_Like_Cheese,"A fun and newer introduction for ""Jumanaji""",7,22 February 2006,"After so many years, I think some classic films loose their touches and need to be remembered. ""Zathura"" is a new ""Jumanji"" for this generation that the whole family can enjoy together once again. I know that if I were a child, I could fall in love with this film. Because I did enjoy this as an adult. It has very cool effects, some fun jokes, and a very touching lesson on how to appreciate the things you have. It did disturb me a little though how the kids have a couple mild dirty words in here, because I think that's how kids act today. Oh, well, we can only hope for a Leave it to Beaver future. :) Just kidding! It's a fun family adventure film that anyone can enjoy. I highly recommend.7/10",Zathura - A Space Adventure

20,cherold,Terrifically entertaining,8,12 April 2020,"This semi-sequel to Jumanji flopped at the box office, and I am at a loss to understand why. It's a terrific movie in which two kids play a magical board game that sends them on an outer-space adventure of killer robots, killer aliens, a disintegrating suburban home, and sibling rivalry. The cast is appealing, the movie is well-paced, and I can't see why this was a flop and Jumanji was a hit, since they seem about equally fun (perhaps it was just the lack of a big name like Robin Williams; probably).This movie is clearly targeted at kids, but I'm 61 and I really liked it. Highly recommended.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
21,dromasca,they still do teen action movies,6,11 March 2006,"'Zathura' was repeatedly described as a space-located 'Jumanji'. This is quite accurate, as in both movies the pretext is a board game that opens the gate to a fantastic world invading the reality where the child and teen characters live. Asnd while the physical world seems to be destroyed without traces on screen, there is no doubt for the whole duration of the movie that the child characters are as safe as the viewers of the movie are in their armchairs.Still 'Zathura' works at least up to a certain point, because we as spectators are fascinated by the game-reality parallel, and because pulp fiction culture has became lately kind of a innocence seal that applied to what otherwise horror stories and movies allows for the detachment and separation of spectators in the safety zone.With good acting and a willingly cartoonish but still stylish scenography 'Zathura' succeeds to be generally good taste and not too boring. Missing is however the pitch of quality provided by RObin Williams in 'Jumanji'. Tim Robbins has a much lesser role here, and is far from being such a fine actor as Williams. Still, 'Zathira' is good children and teens action entertainment, something not to be missed by concerned parents in our age.",Zathura - A Space Adventure

Technically, this should be a sequel to Jumanji but it is actually not. But that did not stop me from overall enjoying the film.This is about two bickering brothers who play a board game called Zathura and everything that happens in the game happens for real.The acting is pretty good. The constant bickering between Hutcherson and Bobo got tiring after awhile. Dax Shepard and the little screen time Tim Robbins had actually helped out the film.Overall, this is a fun family adventure.

24,lesleyharris30,"A Very Fun Family Adventure,",7,1 July 2017,"Zathura: A Space Adventure is a good movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a talented cast. It's a very fun film that takes the basic concept of Jumangi by having a board game that causes disastrous effects when being played, and is entirely unlike it in any way other than that. Instead of taking place in the real world, the characters in this movie remain at home, that is transported to space. A lot of fun characters and chaos ensues as the kids try to get their home back to earth. It is a little slow for a kids film, it tends to drag on with certain sequences a lot more than we would have expected from a Jumangi movie. It is certainly less adventure filled, being a lot more grounded, very character based. I thought the characters in this movie were developed really well, and the young actors suited the personalities perfectly. I found myself really caring for Walter, Danny and Lisa, far more than I did for the main characters in Jumangi. I thought Dax Shepard was terrific as the unnamed Astronaut, his character had an excellent arch that stretches far beyond what any of us would have expected. He serves as this movies Robin Williams, being the one who has already experienced the board game, and helping the kids win by avoiding the mistakes he made. I was very intrigued by Shepard's performance. Harmless fun from start to finish. Funny and heartwarming, Zathura: A Space Adventure is far better than I had anticipated, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film, genuinely enjoyable for all ages. Two young boys are transported in to space, along with their older sister, as a result of a board game that they must win in order to return home.

25,A_Different_Drummer,Bookends Jumanji... a rare sub-genre. Brilliant,9,31 December 2013,"Elsewhere in the database, I rated Jumanji a 10 and reviewed it. In the review I emphasized that it embodied a rare sub-genre of fantasy where the narrative overpowered all the other elements of the film and dragged the viewer, kicking and screaming, down the rabbit hole, whether he wanted to go, or not. What better way to turbo-charge the narrative, I asked, than base the movie on a kid's game with ""turns"" and ""dice""? It was a brilliant gimmick but frankly, like the Fearless Freep character in Bugs Bunny who hi-dives into a pail of water, it seemed like it could only be done once. I was wrong. Ten years later, and just after the brilliant Elf, director Favreau (before he became a Hollywood action-movie god) does it again. This film bookends Jumanji. Jumanji was perfect; and this one is almost perfect. A few moments here and there where the attention lags, but nothing serious. Should become an enduring classic. Also, for trivia buffs, a chance to catch Kristen Stewart before her career goes supernova.",Zathura - A Space Adventure

Father is gone and big sister Lisa considers her brothers royal pains. Once the two boys start playing, however, they find that Zathura is an ultimate reality game. All at once, the house is flying through space and robots, lizard aliens, and stranded astronauts arrive at their doorstep. The boys keep playing the game, guessing that it is their only chance of returning home. But, will they make it back alive? This sequel to Jumanji is fine entertainment for families. The actors are appealing (Tim Robbins has a very small role), the script is adequate, and the special effects are very worthwhile. The best thing that one can say about Zathura, however, is that it makes science fun. This viewer is betting that children who watch the film will be running to the library or Internet to investigate outer space, the planets, the stars and more. With that in mind, do find a way to show the film to your smaller loved ones. Doses of learning go down well when they are presented in this appealing format.",Zathura - A Space Adventure

There is a simple message by the end of the movie, one that offers a clean and clear emotional punch with the twist at the end too. The bantering between brothers is wonderfully presented in this movie and the conflict of divorce and the emotional turmoil it can cause is well on display, much more so than most movies of this genre. The action is sometimes pretty intense and the children's response not always connecting with the audience, but the pacing and fascinating events are entertaining. The daughter's role seems neglected. And some of the scenes aren't completely believable in terms of fantasy and the situation as if sometimes the boys don't have anything much to do except move about without explanation.

28,The-Sarkologist,Jumanji in Space,6,4 July 2017,"I do remember watching this, though it must have been back in the time when I wasn't reviewing all the films that I have watched, which meant that this was one of the films that fell into the cracks. I vaguely remember my brother hiring it from the video shop and me watching it with half an eye, and then thinking that maybe this film wasn't all that bad so deciding to actually go and watch it again from the beginning. Well, I did just that, and I did it again quite recently so that I can now add this to the one thousand odd reviews of films that I have written and posted to date.To put it simply, and quite a few other people have mentioned this as well, this film is basically Jumanji in space. In a sense the spectacle isn't as great as what I remember from Jumanji, and the main characters are basically a couple of young brothers, though the sister does make an appearance near the end. The film is about two brothers who are always getting on each other's nerves, and unfortunately their father has to disappear off the work. However, while trapped in the cellar, one of the brothers finds a game and starts playing and this catapulting them into a science-fiction universe full of heat seeking, and human eating, Zorgons.What annoyed me a bit about the film was how nasty the brother's were to each other, and how the younger brother seemed to be getting the rough end of the stick. It felt as if the older brother was the favourite (and behaved like it), and it was the younger one who kept on getting told off. In fact the older one could be incredibly vicious and nasty at times. As such, I felt that the fate that he suffered in the alternate reality was actually quite fitting (which you eventually work out in the end).The film itself is okay, however not incredibly exhilarating. It is basically a kid's film, and like Jumanji, to escape the game they have to go through right to the end. However, what is noticeable is that there aren't actually any major adults in the film, with the exception of the astronaut (whose identity becomes apparent as the film comes to a close). Oh, and all of the action takes place in the house, it is just that the game lifts the house out of suburbia and throws it into the middle of an inhabited universe. It's a fun movie, but one not to take too seriously, and they could have eased off on the kids a bit as well.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
29,briancham1994,Jumanji in space,7,5 August 2020,"This film is essentially ""Jumanji in space"". It features some children playing another board game that comes to life. This one is more interesting, I feel, but that's probably because I just like science fiction and going to space sounds more interesting than having an elephant rampage through your home. There is a cast of funny and dynamic child characters and a lot of wacky scenarios with some cool twists and turns.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
30,filipemanuelneto,"Excellent, but unoriginal.",8,21 November 2017,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this movie when I first started watching it. I just knew it was a fantasy film with familiar content, and I was pleasantly surprised by it's quality. It's a kind of space ""Jumanji"" in which two brothers, with unresolved household disputes, will play a game that will prove to be a huge space adventure where anything can happen. I liked the way the film seeks to convey a moral of the story, focusing on the importance of brotherly love and the family. Jonah Bobo and Josh Hutcherson were very good at leading roles but the building of their characters was essential, allowing the public, especially the younger ones, to identify with one or the other. Kristen Stewart wasn't as effective as the self-centered, egocentric older sister, but she did provide a few moments of humor. Dax Sheppard was excellent and his performance gave this film its most emotional moments. Last but not least, the very good special effects that the film used, convincing yet discreet enough not to dominate the screen. Still a word to praise the good soundtrack, very competent in her role.In short: this film is excellent, although not very original and recycle the formula already used in another film. It will please easily at any age and is perfect for a family serenade with everyone in the room together watching and spending quality time together.

32,BaronBl00d,Beware of Dust-laden Games Hiding About Old Houses!,5,11 March 2006,"Yes, this is definitely a familiar film to me. It is basically Jumanjii set in space rather than the jungle. No Robin Williams here either, but we do have two siblings, fighting a lot about their lives, when one starts playing a space game called Zathura and then the meteorites start to hit the fan. The house is catapulted into space, alien lizards abound, and a robot malfunctions as just some of the various scenarios enacted by cards(just like in Jumanjii). Well, I liked Jumanjii more for several reasons: Robin Williams, a better, more cohesive story, more humour, and, did I say, Robin Williams. Nonethless, Zathura is an entertaining picture in its own right. The two child leads, Jonah Bobo and Josh Hutcherson, do serviceable jobs. Director Jon Favreau is very able at creating some wonderfully shot scenes of the house in space. The special effects are dazzling(for CGI). Tim Robbins has a nice small part as Dad and Dax Sheperd gives a fine performance as the astronaut. Kristin Stweart as the teen sister is a waste, but the overall story has some nice points and a good theme about the difficulty that can exist between two brothers in a divorce situation. Zathura is not grand in any way, but it is definitely solid, entertaining diversion for the entire family.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
33,digitalbeachbum,Good fun for the family,7,10 May 2021,"This movie came out after Jumanji and it was still a better movie. I found this far more entertaining and more fantasy believable. They didn't have an all star cast like they did in Jumanji but they did really good with what they had on staff.The story is easy to follow, the special effects are ok, the script is easy to follow, the casting is good and the direction is too.The entire family should like this movie. Great family fun.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
34,Anonymous_Maxine,Jumanji 2000,7,29 March 2009,"The similarities between Zathura and its 1995 counterpart, Jumanji, are so extensive that you will probably end up having exactly the same opinion of the new one as you did of the original. But Zathura is not really a sequel to Jumanji, it's more of a remake. Strange that a remake would come along so soon after the first movie, but there area some definite leaps forward in terms of special effects, although not in terms of the plot, which is pretty much identical to Jumanji.An important difference is that the characters in Zathura are three-dimensional and realistic. The performances of the two boys in the movie, as well as the dialogue written for them, approach a level of flawlessness that I would never have expected to see from such young actors. Clearly, it's not exactly much of a stretch for them to get in character, since they are essentially playing themselves, but these are a couple of the best young performances I've ever seen in a movie. Kristen Stewart, who has appeared more more than 20 movies in her less than 20 years, also nails her lines as their disgusted older sister Lisa.There is a scene mid-way through the movie where, for reasons that should give you an idea of what kind of adventure this is, the family sofa slowly rolls end over end and on fire into the depths of outer space. My immediate reaction was to think 'Hey, fire doesn't burn in space' and then I remembered that the burning sofa was emerging from a charming two- story home which was orbiting Saturn with two young boys standing on the porch. The application of logic will do nothing but aggravate you and totally ruin the experience.Tim Robbins has a limited role of a divorced father of two young boys, Walter and Danny, who are just at that age where they fight over everything imaginable. Frustrations are growing as dad needs time to himself for work, Danny wants to play with his older brother, and Walter wants nothing to do with him. Dad has to leave them alone for a while to go to the office, and Danny finds a game buried in the basement called Zathura. He tries to get Walter to play, but Walter wants to watch ESPN. As is the case in the first movie, the game is started accidentally and then All Hell Breaks Loose.What begins with a harmless indoor meteor shower that completely destroys nothing but the living room soon evolves to the point where the house has been uprooted and put into orbit around Saturn and an armada of space ships piloted by vicious Zorgons are attacking with all manner of alien firepower. Similarities to the first movie get a little too close for comfort when it's revealed that the boys have to finish the game successfully in order to get back to the real world, but it doesn't stop the movie from being a lot of fun.My only real gripe with the movie is that I think they overshot a little bit with the message about the importance of siblings. It's clear that the movie is aimed for a bit of a younger audience due to the heavy reliance on action and special effects and the thinness of the plot, but when the truth is revealed about the astronaut that fulfills the role of Robin Williams' character in Jumanji it's pretty hard not to roll the eyes at least a little bit. It is, however, an important message, although a little less ham-handedness in the delivery wouldn't have hurt. As a science fiction film the movie works great, especially as a more family-oriented story. The special effects are impressive (particularly the killer robot, which is probably the most consistently outstanding effect in the entire movie) and the dangers of space travel and alien encounters are mixed brilliantly with the storybook adventure of two young boys trapped in a dangerous situation and simply trying to, ah, get home. If nothing else, Zathura must surely be the biggest adventure that two young boys have ever had in trying to get home without ever leaving their house.Director Jon Favreau first came to my attention in Swingers in 1996 but has lately been making big waves in the directing department. His previous directing features had been Elf and the hilarious 2001 crime comedy Made, and lately he's been keeping himself busy with the first two Iron Man movies. Zathura seems like a perfect midway point between the amusing comedies of his early directing career and the big-time science fiction that he's working on now. Zathura is not his best work, but it's definitely some of the better family- oriented science fiction to come along recently.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
35,lisafordeay,Think of Jumanji in Space and you get this adventure romp,5,29 May 2014,"Zathura: A Space Adventure is a 2005 action packed fantasy adventure about two brothers who don't see eye to eye.

So when Walter's younger brother comes across a mysterious board game called Zathura: A Space Adventure he decides to play it. But when he does play it things get out of hand,between a meteor shower,a robot,a bunch of Zortagans(basically lizards from outer space) and a stranded astronaut(who is really Walter from the future,which is a twist in the movie). Stars The Shawshank Redemption's Tim Robbins as Walter and his younger brother(Jonah Bobo)'s father,Twlight's Kristen Stewart as Lisa,Jonah Bobo(who I think is in Diary Of A Whimpey Kid with Zachary Gordan)and Josh Hutcherson from Hunger Games and Epic.

36,FiendishDramaturgy,In a word? Boring!,4,14 March 2007,"Jumanji was fun and zany. It wasn't a fantastic movie, but it entertained the kiddies. This installment is nothing more than a rehash of the same story, set in space, with a pair of brothers. It was supposed to be uplifting, and adventurous; instructional in the ways of brothers.It failed, utterly.I can't say good things about this sequel. No Robin Williams, no zany antics, no fun. Just typical fare, and not even good enough to entertain. The kids might like it, but if you're over 10, I doubt seriously this will be enjoyable for you.It rates a 3.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
37,Polaris_DiB,Suspense-filled Sci-Fi Adventure,8,17 February 2006,"Well it's been a good couple of weeks for family and family-rated films out on DVD these past couple of weeks. We've gotten the amazing and utterly joyful Wallace and Gromit in the Curse of the Wererabbit, we've gotten the magical and rich world of MirrorMask, and we've gotten the science fiction bonanza of Zathura.The latter film and the focus of this little review is a story about a breaking home, two brothers in a divorced family that argue all of the time and can't seem to be comfortable with each other and who, eventually, must work out their differences in a pretty magnificent and original way: tearing apart the home pane-by-pane as they shoot through outer-space playing a board game.Which is interesting, if you think about it, the whole theme of broken home/horrors of nature that the characters experience in this film and in Jumanji, it's counterpart. It's not a big theme, it's just something that's there, but both groups of children have relatively unhappy homelifes and they both play a board game that realizes their fears and causes them to grow up, in a sense.In terms of any realness to this picture, some people might feel stuff a bit lacking. You know, they can breathe in space, the couch keeps burning after it leaves the atmosphere of the living room, so on and so forth. Actual physics has next to nothing of importance in this film, but what it does have is pretty amazing special effects... as in, really, I couldn't see through any of them. Huh, weird, since much bigger and more appreciated films with much bigger budgets tend to have very obvious special effects and an entire lack of a plot, too! State of contemporary film, people.The only thing really a problem with this film, if one considers it a problem, is that the character of Lisa is pretty underdeveloped and actually helps undermine a lot of what the boys discover about trust and growing up. However, she becomes such a minor character that it's mostly incidental, so if she bothers you she's easier to ignore. Then, of course, it's kind of hard to imagine any house taking that much abuse and still stand, right to the very end, even taking into account the lack of care for physics and reality in it. So if those are issues that really bother you, I guess you'll just have to be bothered.--PolarisDiB",Zathura - A Space Adventure
38,GiraffeDoor,I was happy to play along till the end.,7,21 June 2021,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie that even child me thought looked kind of dumb.I guess, don't judge a movie by its trailer... Admittedly it doesn't begin strongly. I get that they're establishing a thematic foundation and a relationship between the brothers but watching these children squabble for the first 15 minutes (it felt that long) of the movie is not going to enchant anyone and gets pretty schmaltzy.It's quite bizarre when they start playing the game and everything kicks off since the movie up until that point gives you no clue it's coming but I guess everyone who saw this saw the trailer (well I guess the title does have ""space adventure"" right there...) and the rest of the movie is quite a ride.The numerous dangers feel very real, not just by a prudent judgement of CGI and practical efforts (with a particularly formidable robot) but in a competent approach to visualizing the set pieces.The story that follows on the theme of brotherhood is not too heavy handed and touched the emotional nerves it meant to with at least one neat surprise.My girl Kristen doesn't get the screen time she deserves but she is, as always, a delight to watch.As for the antagonists, the Zorgons: I was so impressed with how they were handled. A quite place just blew its load in the first scene but they kept them unseen menace for a long time and the way they feed us glimpses is absolutely tense. Nothing about this movie's concept makes you think that it would have any impressive command of suspense but they manage it.So a lot better than it had a right to be.",Zathura - A Space Adventure

The movie starts by introducing the troubled family  2 feuding and competitive brothers, an overworked divorced father, and a teenage daughter. The older brother traps the younger one in the basement of their house and he find the Zathura game. Once they begin playing the game, the chaos begins. Everything from meteorites to robots to aliens are introduced as they go thru the game as the house floats in space until they can complete the game and go home. They encounter an older version of one of the brothers as a space astronaut who helps them a little while and also reveals some things about the character to help him deal with his younger brother in a better way.

40,noralee,Rollicking Family Entertainment,9,21 November 2005,"""Zathura"" is rollicking family entertainment. I haven't read, either by myself or to my kids, any books by Chris Van Allsburg or seen other adaptations of his work, so I came with an open mind and laughed heartily at the humor and got caught up in the adventure.The opening set up is near pitch perfect in capturing family interactions. It's nice to see Tim Robbins get to play closer to his self than usual as a gray-haired dad. Though the discussion about the impact of divorce is a bit heavy-handed, it's still believable. As the mother of sons who fought up to junior high I can testify that the brother battles are impeccably portrayed, both in the dialog by writers David Koepp and John Kamps and as easily and naturally enlivened by Jonah Bobo (kid brother ""Danny"") and Josh Hutcherson (older brother ""Walter""), who was also wonderful in ""Little Manhattan."" This naturalism turned out to be important for the key element of the theme and plot that I hadn't anticipated as it continued to avoid mawkishness.The set-up to the game-playing is very well-done. I like that the game is old and beat-up and each card is worn with age. Up until the theme kicks in, I was thoroughly enjoying the film as a sci fi take on ""The Cat in the Hat."" Jon Favreau segues marvelously from the daily reality to well-integrated special effects and keeps excellent pacing balance between family relationships and the action. There's only a brief shot here and there where it's obvious that blue-screen acting reactions are going on. The trailer managed not to give away all the visual and plot twists.Half way through the game, Dax Shepard shows up as the Astronaut and he's an entertaining cross between Harrison Ford and Zach Braff. His blend of seriousness and charm adds to the credibility of the continuing story.The teen sister's portrayal is a bit thin script-wise, but she doesn't have a lot to do, except for a frisson of an amusing ""Star Wars""-referenced plot point. At least she's not just a damsel in distress. There are affectionate tributes to other sci fi icons as well, such as an ""E.T.""-like bicycle floating around and a robot very like the one in ""Lost in Space,"" and some silly jokes like planet Tsouris-3, but those are consistent with the old-fashionedness of the board game.For once, John Debney's busy and non-stop music fits the action.The film does not pander to children and enthrallingly keeps adult attention in its twists and resolution, and it is as much a warm-hearted comedy as well as a jolly good tale. Too bad I probably won't be able to get my now 20something sons, who are now good friends, to see it as they would appreciate the movie's lesson.",Zathura - A Space Adventure

42,aharmas,Jumanji in Space,9,15 November 2005,"There is a lot going for this film, and it all begins with the children who have the leading roles. Their solid chemistry carries the film, taking you in for the ride, and almost making you forget you have seen this many times before. It is that sense of familiarity with ""Jumanji"", a work by the same author, that either sinks or saves the film. It a relief to say that the film works because the setting and the pacing are appropriate, energetic, accessible, and quite enjoyable. There is depth and pathos in the storyline, depicting the relationship between two brothers, at its best and at its worst.Not having a solid evil counterforce is about the only aspect of the film that is weak. Its episodic nature is padded with mini-cliffhangers, and with our sympathy for the protagonists, we stick around because in a minimal way, we care.There are some spectacular visuals, with the aid of computer generated imagery, we are transported to the middle of outer space, and we witness the arrival of technology that mostly threatens our heroes for most of the film. However, the dynamics of their relationship is never neglected. That gives the film a very solid center.""Zathura"" is worth the price of admission.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
43,Sherazade,Silly fun!,8,21 April 2006,"I appreciated the fact that with a film that required such great imagination, they didn't overwhelm it with CGI stuff. They thankfully shot it the traditional way which made it more nostalgic and easier to believe. Zathura is the story of two young brothers who don't get along with each other, very much like any average sibling to sibling relationship you can think of. One day, while rummaging through the basement, the younger brother finds an old game called Zathura and brings it to his brother and they begin to play it. Before either one knows it, they are thrown into a space world where they have to battle to keep control of the game in order to survive scary aliens amongst other things that want to inhabit their home and eat them along the way. This film reminded me of Jumanji, only that it's darker and more scary. I didn't like the fact that the kids were allowed to use bad language and the part where the older sister chick accidentally had a crush on her brother was quite disturbing.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
44,aimless-46,Kindergarten to Fifth Grade Unless You are a Kristen Stewart Fan,6,4 August 2006,"Those who criticize ""Zathura"" for being a copycat ""Jumanji"" are apparently clueless about the Van Allsburg's books. ""Zathura"" is a sequel to ""Jumanji"", it is about what happened when the Budwing brothers opened the game box that Peter and Judy discarded at the end of ""Jumanji"". Early board games were often designed with two-sided boards so that the game pieces could be used to play two different games-usually of the same type. ""Zathura"" was the flip side of the ""Jumanji"" game board and the ones the brothers chose to play (because Walter did not like jungle games). So it is ""supposed"" to be like another ""Jumanji"".Having grown up with this same sibling age dynamic (six and ten) I was not surprised at the amount of yelling, anger, and resentment that goes on between the two brothers. I was however surprised that anyone would find this sort of thing entertaining. While their divorced father (Tim Robbins playing the only sympathetic character in the film) is away at a meeting, the younger brother (Danny) finds an old Zathura game in the basement. Based on those old 1950's tin toys it involves two tin spaceships on a track racing around space. Each spin of the dial determines the distance the ship will move on that turn and a card is ejected detailing what happens to the ship at that point of space. As Danny and Walter face the challenges of space they discover that they can work as a team and they even develop some affection for each other (a more unrealistic idea than anything they actually encounter in space). Like the source book, the movie adaptation of ""Zathura"" targets kindergarten to Grade 5 children. Like ""Sharkboy and Lavagirl"", older viewers will find very little of interest other than a fun production design and nice effects. Unfortunately ""Zathura"" it is not as pure as ""Sharkboy and Lavagirl"", which uniquely refused to compromise its ""for kids only"" story. ""Zathura"" does compromise, as the producers attempt to expand their audience by creating an older sister (Lisa played by Kristen Stewart) who was not a character in the book. While Stewart is fine in this role and even provides some comic relief, it is rather disturbing that the producers chose to turn her into a pubescent sex object, blustering around the house in her underwear for most of the film. Van Allsburg's illustrations are the best part of his books but a ""hot teenage sister"" is not an image he has ever published. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",Zathura - A Space Adventure

46,Rob_Taylor,"Zathura....it means ""clone alert!"" in Zorgonese.",5,27 January 2006,"OK. So let me get this straight. Zathura and Jumanji were penned by the same author, right? So naturally, one could assume similar style and content. Fair enough. But good God! This is almost a clone of Jumanji! What did the author do? Just cross out the word ""Jumanji"" at the top of the old manuscript, write ""Zathura"" in its place and re-submit it? Seriously, if you've seen Jumanji, you've seen Zathura. And trust me, without Robin Williams to liven it up, Zathura is simply an exercise in CGI, with added screaming kids for good measure.The similarities are just glaringly obvious. Talk about a cash-cow bandwagon! Even what happens in the two game's are almost (allowing for the change of venue) the same.Jumanji has a natural disaster (earthquake). Zathura has a natural disaster (meteor shower).Jumanji has a character that emerges from the game (hunter). Zathura has a character that emerges from the game (astronaut).Jumanji incapacitates a character (spider-bite). Zathura incapacitates a character (cryogenically frozen).Jumanji has a menacing monster (the lion). Zathura has a menacing monster (the robot).I was too stunned by the blatant similarity to notice if they occurred in the same order in the two movies, but Great Scot! Have they no shame? Take my advice, watch Jumanji and do not give this blatant clone a single penny of your money. I hope the author is proud of this.

Also, we are in the middle of an unfinished game which launches the house into outer space where it is ""threatened"" by hungry alien lizards, meteors, and black holes. Again, the house is turned into a ""shambles"" and everything returns back to normal once the game is finally finished. I do not know what character I like better; the ""frozen"" older sister or the goofy-wacky robot ""monster"". The aliens like to melt down and salvage everything for fuel, as well as eat delicious humans. A great ""twist"" is that the ""Astronaut"" is the young boy's older brother who was suspended and trapped inside the game and therefore forgotten in real time. It is missing a charismatic character actor like a Robin Williams type, but still most enjoyable to watch. Again, the game is buried at the end but will be re-discovered in the future, no doubt.

I appreciated Jumanji for many reasons. But, I, on the otherhand, did not appreciate Zathura, which is pretty much the same film. But eliminate the creativity and the fun that Jumanji was. How could somebody disagree with me... Zathura is a ripoff. Like Jumanji, the film has two kids who play a magical board game. Like Jumanji, the film has a great cast. But unlike Jumanji, Zathura is a tad less enjoyable and deserves less credit than it got.It's not that Zathura was overrated. It's just that some people hated Jumanji but liked Zathura. I am one of the rare few who prefers Jumanji over Zathura. I just think that Zathura is weird and doesn't make all that much sense. I think the surprise in the end was... well, surprising. For people to say that Zathura is better than Jumanji is just ridiculous. They are both pretty much the same film, besides the space thing. I was more into the jungle theme more anyways. The plot to Zathura is recycled. Chris Van Allsberg must've made this book more recently because the guy is creative, but there's not much creativity in this. I give Zathura a mild thumbs down. It's not that it's a bad film, it's just that it doesn't have what Jumanji has. Creativity and good special effects.

It has the literary quality of a modern fable and even expresses a few nice moral points about families, patience, and responsibility.Two little guys - Danny and Walt - are stuck home alone with their disinterested teenage sister. Walt, the younger, desperately wants Danny to play with him, but Danny thinks his younger brother is annoying and ignores him. Exploring the basement, Walt finds a gorgeous old mechanical rocket ship race game called Zathura. On each turn, the game spits out a card and whatever the card says, happens..... IN REAL LIFE.Danny can't help but get drawn into the game, and eventually, the boys figure out that the only way they are going to escape the Zorgons, get their sister out of cryogenic suspension, and get their house back to earth will be to finish the game. But at what cost? Zathura keeps up a brisk, entertaining pace, and is scripted intelligently enough to engage most young intellects. I especially enjoyed the fact that the kids each had their own personalities and were anything but stereotypes. Although the film is appropriate for all ages, there are some concepts which might disturb or frighten young kids - so look before you leap.Great script, very nicely directed and edited, and with a very clever, wild story. Most of the acting was very good - especially Jona Bobo and Josh Hutcherson (Danny and Walter). Dax Shepard occasionally ran into some trouble, but did fine in one of the film's more challenging roles.Recommended for sci-fi adventure fans, and adventurous family viewing.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
54,blott2319-1,A vast improvement on the Jumanji formula,6,3 August 2020,"It's kind of interesting how Zathura did so much to duplicate everything that happened in Jumanji, and yet managed to do it all better. This isn't a great film, but it is a vast improvement on the mess that is Jumanji. So, rather than a straight review of Zathura, I'd like to do a comparative analysis of why this movie works where Jumanji fails:1. Delay of game - I appreciate that they give some reasons for all the delays between the kids taking turns in Zathura. In Jumanji, I kept asking ""Why don't they just roll the dice right as fast as possible?!"" and the only answer the script gave was ""Because we need the movie to happen."" Here we have bickering brothers, we have the board blown away or stolen, and we have a slightly more complex way of taking turns than just rolling a pair of dice.2. Family drama - There are some interesting things done in Zathura with the relationship between the two brothers which Jumanji lacked. I was emotionally invested in the dispute between these siblings because it feels so authentic. Boys do fight amongst themselves, and I could see this kind of animosity developing between two brothers particularly when they are dealing with a divorce. Robin WIlliams' frustration with his father felt hollow and without proper justification.3. Practical magic - There are so many things in Zathura that are handled with practical effects. We get reptilian aliens, and giant robots that look spectacular (thanks to Stan Winston Studios.) Because they establish so much with practical effects, it becomes easy to buy in when they have CGI added to the mix. Jumanji on the other hand includes only a handful of clumsy practical effects that look like something I could throw together without much effort, and then they include boatloads of CGI that is laughably bad.4. Kids these days - This is one area where the two films are probably on par with each other. It's so hard to find good child actors and both of these movies didn't manage that feat. Just like I found the whining kids in Jumanji annoying, the bickering and whining of Josh Hutcherson and Jonah Bobo was also obnoxious. I do think these characters are fleshed out a bit more, and their established personalities actually affect how they play the game, but I can't help being somewhat bothered by them.5. Hardened adults - One of the flaws in Jumanji is that they hired Robin Williams, who is a comedic genius, to play the serious role of a traumatized guy who has spent decades separated from the world. Here they bring in Dax Shepard, and it works better. I wouldn't say Dax is exactly a brilliant actor, but at least no one went to this family film hoping that he would start cracking jokes or doing impressions.6. Lesson learned - Because these movies are ostensibly kids movies, or at least targeted towards a younger demographic, it's nice when there's actually something a child could come to understand better after watching the film. Zathura pulls that off to some degree, as we see the brothers learning to love one another and get past some of their issues. Jumanji struggles to even convince me that there should be any apologies from the kid, or anything learned by him, as his father is the antagonist in their relationship.I don't want to give the impression that Zathura is a masterpiece. This is still not my favorite story because it involves a lot of random stuff happening to our protagonists rather than them actively doing things to further the plot. As I said, the kids still were a bit obnoxious in this movie, and that took away some of my enjoyment as well. In fact, even though I think Zathura is much better than Jumanji, both of them pale in comparison to the modern sequels that have completely reinvented the franchise. However, if I'm going to watch one of the first two films, it's going to be this one every single time.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
55,hnt_dnl,"Hilarious, heartwarming family friendly movie!",9,2 June 2011,"Some of my favorite movies end up being ones that I come upon by total accident and this film ZATHURA (2005) fits both categories! I stumbled upon it on TV years ago not long after it came out, not knowing what to expect and by the end of it, I realized I had just seen a well done project.Directed by actor Jon Favreau, ZATHURA is a rarity in that it is a ""kids"" movie, but never comes across as cheesy, annoying, or boring, mainly due to good writing, acting, and directing. And I think many adults can enjoy this movie, too! Also, a big part of the movie's charm is entirely set in one location, an old-style multi-level house filled with antiques and antiquated contraptions, such as a basement lift, which is used to great effect several times in the movie.The family dynamic is the heart of the movie and a huge reason why it feels so authentic and is very re-watchable. The great Tim Robbins ironically plays only a small role as he bookends the movie as the middle-aged, hard-working, divorced Dad, but I like how the movie early on establishes a real relationship and chemistry between Robbins and the young actors playing his kids, then turns the movie over to them. The real stars are Jonah Bobo (as 6-year old Danny), Josh Hutcherson (as 10-year old Walter), and none other than superstar ingenue Kristen Stewart (as 15-year old Lisa).Special kudos must go to Bobo and Hutcherson as these boys do a tremendous job of carrying the movie from start to finish. I was totally engaged with and enthralled with the Walter-Danny sibling rivalry and camaraderie throughout the movie. And, for my money, as the boys' mean-spirited older sister Lisa, Kristen Stewart literally steals every one of her scenes. I personally think this is her true best film performance to date. These 3 actors really capture the essence of just being a KID! None of that emo, odd, angsty stuff that too many movies try to portray nowadays. The main thing is that all these kids are FUNNY! The movie's plot involves little Danny, who is bored and mad that his older bro Walter won't play with him, finding in his Dad's basement an old space adventure game called ""Zathura"". Danny starts the game and it literally comes to life with attacking robots, space monsters, meteor showers et cetera! Walter is forced to play with Danny in order to restore order. During one of their turns, an astronaut (Dax Shepard in a terrific performance) shows up to help the boys win the game, but also to urge them that the most important thing is not the goal, but in getting there, they must work together and act like brothers! A family friendly sci-fi movie with a moral message and a lot of heart, I highly recommend ZATHURA!",Zathura - A Space Adventure
56,Victor Field,"Everyone's a winner, baby, that's the truth.",8,18 January 2006,"As far as movies based on Chris Van Alsburg books go, ""Zathura: A Space Adventure"" is superior to both ""Jumanji"" and ""The Polar Express."" (Which means it'll probably make less money than either.) Jon Favreau may not rank with Robert Zemeckis, but he certainly kicks Joe Johnston's butt.The plot may well be ""Jumanji In Space,"" but whereas the previous movie was little more than an extended look at the various ways to destroy a house (and those overly cartoonish monkeys didn't help), this one has more of a plot to go with the shenanigans - the relationship between our young protagonists (played without going for easy sentiment by Josh Hutcherson and Jonah Bobo) has as much screen time as the work from Sony Pictures Imageworks and Stan Winston, and rightly so; it's also great to see a family movie about divorced parents where it's accepted as a fact of life and no attempts to reconcile mum and dad are made - mum never even appears here.Screenwriters David Koepp and John Kamps also deserve credit for adapting a (reportedly) slim book in a manner that never seems bloated, the way ""The Polar Express"" did; few characters (apart from the two boys and their father, the only other people in the movie are their sister (Kristen Stewart) and an astronaut they pick up after one turn (Dax Shepard)... who, it must be said, is part of one of the movie's few questionable plot points. Since this isn't a ""This comment may contain spoilers"" review I can't really elaborate, but you'll probably understand what I mean if you see the movie.""Zathura: A Space Adventure"" doesn't stretch the limits of film-making, and I could do without the Paul Simon song at the end, but it - like the under-appreciated ""Sky High"" - shows it is possible to make effects-filled comedies that genuinely do work for the whole family, with some amusingly edgy dialogue (""We never should've rented 'Thirteen'!"") and a built-in spin off premise for the cartoon that would surely have resulted had this been a bigger hit at the North American box office (two kids caught in a game and having to finish it to get back home). Ironically, it would probably not have been as good as the movie... the way the ""Jumanji"" cartoon is far superior to the source.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
57,ProjectAnomaly,Zathura: A Space Adventure,2,1 October 2019,"Oooouuch. This film is really out of this world, and not in a good way. The book wasn't even that good in the first place.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
58,Beta_Gallinger,"Inferior to ""Jumanji"", as I expected, but still a praiseworthy family adventure",7,7 October 2010,"""Jumanji"", an adaptation of the book of the same name by Chris Van Allsburg, is a family fantasy movie I remember seeing more than once back in 1996, the year after it was released. That was late in my childhood, but about four years ago, I finally saw it for the first time in many years, and again just last year. With these two viewings, I was still very impressed with the film. Released ten years after that 1995 blockbuster, ""Zathura: A Space Adventure"" is another adaptation of a Chris Van Allsburg book, and has a similar plot. Discovering that I still liked ""Jumanji"" over a decade later was what led me to this 2005 film. I wasn't expecting this to match its predecessor, but still expected it to be pretty good, which I think it is.Danny and Walter are two brothers who don't tend to get along. Danny is six years and three quarters old, and Walter is ten. Their parents are divorced, and the boys are currently at their father's house. After their father leaves for work one day, and their teenage sister, Lisa is still in bed, their sibling rivalry continues, and Danny ends up alone in the basement. Down there, he finds a board game called Zathura, which he takes upstairs and starts playing. Unfortunately, he doesn't know what happens when one starts playing this game. The two brothers soon discover that the house is now floating in outer space with them inside! Lisa wakes up but doesn't realize she's in outer space before being cryogenically frozen by one of the game's cards! Danny and Walter will only be able to get back to Earth if they finish the game, but the brothers find that each time one of them takes their turn, something very bad happens! The starring roles of Danny and Walter are played by Jonah Bobo and Josh Hutcherson respectively, and these certainly aren't the greatest performances I've ever seen from child actors, but they're okay. Sometimes, the sibling rivalry is a little too much, but this isn't a constant problem. There were times when I thought the movie was maybe a bit bland early on, but this didn't last, as the suspense increases, and many exciting things happen as the boys play the dangerous game! Occasionally, there are also some fairly funny moments. At one point, the game brings the brothers a human astronaut, played by Dax Shepard. While Shepard's performance isn't particularly impressive, the character he plays contributes a lot to the story, including some surprising elements. He may not seem like a very significant character at first, but this soon proves not to be the case. Since ""Zathura: A Space Adventure"" is a sci-fi movie, mostly set in space, it's not surprising that it's also a visual treat, with great special effects.Unlike the ""Jumanji"" movie, this later release doesn't feature the talent of Robin Williams, and none of the cast performances in this 2005 sci-fi fantasy adventure stand out the way Williams and perhaps certain other performers do in its 1995 predecessor. It also may take a little longer for the suspense to really pick up in this film. However, both movies contain an entertaining story with a lot of excitement and excellent visuals. This film is like a sci-fi version of ""Jumanji"", but it's not EXACTLY the same, and even if you're familiar with the first movie of the two, you could find some surprises here. Some people who have seen ""Zathura: A Space Adventure"" might say it's strictly for kids, but I don't completely agree with that. It probably is more appealing to kids than adults, but for me, it sure beat watching the two Power Rangers movies after growing up. If you don't like the film adaptation of ""Jumanji"", you probably wouldn't like this adaptation of ""Zathura"" either. If you do like that movie, you would probably find that this follow-up is inferior, but it could still be worth a look.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
59,vip_ebriega,Bolding going where no board game has gone before.,7,2 August 2008,"My Take: A fun ride, even if the JUMANJI-like elements are pretty familiar and the kids get a tad bit annoying. If you thought the whole concept of JUMANJI was good, take that film into space, lessen the blah dramatic moments and pump up the mild-mannered excitement and you get ZATHURA: A SPACE ADVENTURE. Actually slightly better than the adaptation of Chris Van Allsburg's JUMANJI, ZATHURA is actually a terrific adaptation of Allsburg's other children's book and terrifically satisfies as pure family entertainment. Fast-paced and often clever, ZATHURA is pure take-your-whole-family-and-see-it entertainment that won't disappoint with the reputations before it.Josh Hutcherson and Jonah Bobo play two quarrelsome brothers Walter and Danny, who spend an afternoon alone together, which isn't exactly a treat. Walter is older, and likes MTV, The Sports Channel and being boss, while Danny, the younger, just wanted to spend time with his big brother, who isn't exactly returning the favor. Everything changes (sort of) when Danny gets his hands on an old rusty board game he found in the bowels of their basement. All they needed to do was turn the key, read the small card with the message and hold on for dear life. Turns out, they've been transported into the outer universe of flesh-eating space lizards, a malfunctioned robot, supernovas, and meteor showers. To get back home, they've got to play the game from head to toe, accepting every reward or consequence. Dax Shepard plays the hilarious marooned astronaut who gives them a helping hand and Kristen Stewart (PANIC ROOM) play the brothers' annoyed big sister.One thing you have to admire about ZATHURA is the energy and the sense of fun tapped into every frame by director Jon Favreau. Favreau keeps everything energetic and delightful, with special effects aplenty that looks as if it were imagined by an energetic 8 year-old. Tapping in morality in the film, about brotherly love, is where the film gets its flaws. Walter is too-tough big brother while Danny is a bit too annoying. Trying to tell us that they shouldn't yell at each other during some scenes are trying to push morality too far off. Still, the movie has too many a good thing to overlook the few flaws. Besides, the younger audiences wouldn't give a damn about them anyway. So just sit back, and turn that key.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
60,johno-21,Fun family fantasy flick,9,21 April 2010,"I recently saw this on late night TV. This is destined to be a classic fantasy film that the whole family can watch and enjoy. Based on the book by noted children's author Chris Van Allburg who also wrote 'Polar Express' and 'Jumanji' this was adapted for the screen by David Koepp who wrote screenplays for 'Jurasic Park' I and II, 'Mission Impossible' and 'Spiderman' among his many hits. John Kamps joins Koepp on this screenplay. Danny (Jonah Bobo) and his older brother Walter (Josh Hutcherson) are two fighting siblings of about 7 and 10 years old. Their older teen aged sister Lisa (Kristen Stewart) is a lot older and typically annoyed and distant from them. Their father (Tim Robbins) has to leave for a couple of days and Walter takes out his frustration with Danny by locking him in a dumbwaiter and sending it to the basement. Under the stairs Danny finds an old board space adventure game from the 1950's called Zathura. He brings it upstairs to an indifferent Walter and they began to play it and suddenly they are trapped in the grips of the games world and it transports their house and them into outer space where they circle a giant Saturn-like planet trapped in it's asteroid belt. The games sends a threatening robot and terrorizing space creatures to them and ultimately an astronaut (Dox Shepard) to help them. Oscar award winning cinematographer for 'Pan's Labyrinth' Guillermo Navarro photographs. Jon Faureau, in his third feature as a director, directs. J. Michael Riva heads up the production design and the art direction team of David F. Klassen and Richard F. Mays with set decoration by Lauri Gaffin and a huge special and visual effects department. It's fantasy.

61,Stampsfightclub,"Slight entertainment but end of day, its space Jumanji",5,15 October 2008,"Brothers Danny (Bobo) and Walter (Hutcherson) don't get along and when Danny finds a mysterious looking game in the basement, the pair are thrust into outer space.To many who have seen Jumanji, you are not suffering from déjà vu, this Jon Favreau Sci-Fi adventure resolves around a board game which comes to life in exactly the same way Jumanji did; only this takes place in outer space.Jumanji was one of those rare classics, a fantasy which everyone had thought about long before a film was made about it. Robin Williams led the way in a thrilling and imaginative adventure and created the ultimate enjoyment ride, and sadly a shadow has been cast as sheer visuals take over on a spin of that classic.One thing Jumanji didn't achieve was a true hatred between family members, which to its credit Zathura does. Bobo and Hutcherson are great in their respective roles as brothers who really struggle to get along, and are easy to see why through some real hard dialogue. The pair achieves a strong hatred for each other on screen and carries it all the way through, which creates a realistic issue.Though similar to Jumanji, there are differences and are fairly exciting. The tense and dramatic start with the rivalry between the brothers established it was an unexpected surprise and then when the game is introduced does the film dive into a different dimension and take off properly.The build up to the game was good but once underway, was disappointing as a poorly directed meteor shower didn't prove anything and when trying to prove to sister Kristen Stewart is pure embarrassment and predictable at best.There is slight excitement with every turn that is played. We see plenty of space elements including shooting stars, aliens (Zorgons they're called, that's original) and astronauts.There is no realism in the context of any situation with poor just in time scenarios and one of the most predictable twists imaginable, which at the end seemed very far-fetched.The plot tries to entertain through the action and the environment but is never properly cemented and revolves around the urgency to hate each other and get home.The graphics are good, but if you don't have that killer plot then the graphics do not achieve anything.Zathura is basically Jumanji in space, a Sci-fi which ruins the concept of the Williams 1995 classic, with its poor script, unrealistic action and some poor direction",Zathura - A Space Adventure
62,fwomp,Jumanji Critics ...Go Take A Nap,8,16 February 2006,"Open up your imagination to the world of Zathura. Kids and adults alike will revel in this great story about two young brothers who find an old board-style game called Zathura that literally launches them and their home into outer-space. Danny and Walter are the brothers and when their father leaves them alone with their teenage sister for a few minutes, worlds collide and their home becomes a space-bound asteroid, but not because of any interstellar cataclysm. It's all related to the game Zathura that the younger Danny finds and begins playing.Their father's beautiful arts and crafts style home is magically transported to the nether reaches of space and as the boys play the game  in an attempt to get back to Earth  more and more bizarre occurrences happen. A meteor shower pummels the house. A defective robot tries to kill the elder brother, Walter. Zorgons, weird, space-faring lizard-men, track their home because of the warmth radiating off it. A stranded spaceman joins the duo and has much more vested in the game than we could ever imagine. Walter and Danny's sister goes into cryogenic sleep for ""five turns"" only to awaken in the midst of this spaceflight odyssey.Can the boys make it home? Will they be able to finish the game? Can they put aside their sibling rivalries and become loving brothers? Why is the stranded astronaut helping them? What will Dad say when he gets home and finds out there is no home?There's been a lot of controversial talk amongst film-o-philes about this movie and JUMANJI. There's no doubt that there's an incredibly strong similarity between the two (a house being overrun by animals versus space creatures; a family in crisis that's forced to come together; a board game that recreates a fantasy; a happy ending that gets fixed-up before adults arrive back in the picture; and so on).Regardless of those striking comparisons, Zathura is a really fun film to watch. The two brothers are believable, and when they fight it reminded me of the great arguments I had with my brothers when I was growing up.The amazingly beautiful arts and crafts home. It was painful watching it get destroyed piece by piece. Sitting on a gimbal, too, it was surprising (watching the special features on the DVD) to learn that director Jon Favreau used minimal digital special effects and built miniatures, etc. in order to get the desired effects for the film.The ridiculous nature of the story allowed me to suspend disbelief and just go with it. We all know that fire doesn't burn in outer-space (they light a sofa on fire and kick it out the door), and that a person could never survive fifteen years floating around in space in a spacesuit (the astronaut), but so what.I was also a tad surprised about the astronaut. I'd surmised quite a bit about the movie as it continued (being able to guess pretty easily what was going to happen next and why) but when the true nature of the stranded astronaut came to light, I felt a bit choked-up (yeah, yeah, I know).So sit back and enjoy the film, and try not to get overly critical about its obvious relation to JUMANJI.",Zathura - A Space Adventure

Part of the problem may lie in the movie's attempts to resolve the rivalry between the two brothers. This involves a rather bizarre plot twist.

So our first question is why didn't mum get custody? Oh, and in case you were wondering, we never get to see mum anyway.The kids wreck one of his drawings that he needs for a meeting (why his study isn't locked and why he has a drink that can spill anywhere near his work are never addressed.Dad pops out to work (can you say Home Alone? Quick call Social Services, he abandoned his kids!) and the kids start playing and are very quickly pulled into the world of Zathura where you know they are going to learn moral lessons about getting on with each other and learning tolerance (A film from America is trying to teach the world these things? Get Real! That's like China trying to teach me about freedom!) Big Sister is left in charge and doesn't care about either brother. Again you know by the end she'll be as thick as thieves with both of them. When they run through the house this an obvious set-up to show us how the house is laid out for later in the film so we know how each room interacts with the rest of the house.The only problem is the dumb waiter, someone ""Forgets"" how many levels the house has later in the film. Visually the film looks stunning, the Astronauts costume, the Zargon ships and ""Goats"", the actual game itself looks very 1950's.The Zargons were a bit 1970's Doctor Who type looking.Generally other than that the film is OK. It's a bit slow towards the end and they forget to go right back to the sister after the 5 moves she is frozen for (they go back after the 7th move, I counted) The kids were really annoying, especially the younger one.

Perhaps Tim Robbins could have been in more of the story, even if he played a different character like the father in Jumanji.Sometimes the action seemed to slow way down, but thankfully it was never for too long.Not too bad for a family film.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
74,DavidSim240183,Zathura is stratospheric fun!,9,9 September 2006,"I've always had a certain affection for Jumanji. Granted the plot is on the slight side and it's carried by a barrage of special effects, but it still entertains, and its a lively romp. 10 years have passed, and we now have an almost unofficial sequel, with the same basic premise, but more fleshed out characters, and the action taking place this time in outer space. That film is Zathura.Danny and Walter are two bickering brothers who have been left at home while their Dad has had to run out to work for an hour. In the meantime, Danny discovers a retro-styled board game in the dumb-waiter. A game called ZATHURA. A very old-fashioned game with wind-up figures and cards that slot out, when Danny starts playing, the house is suddenly blasted off into outer space.Unaware of ZATHURA'S incredible powers, Danny and Walter now have to put their differences aside and work together to finish the game if they ever hope to return home. But that's easier said than done with some of the obstacles the game throws at them. Meteor showers, runaway robots, lethal aliens and black holes.Anyone who's seen Jumanji will recognise the similarities between that film and Zathura, but in some ways Zathura is a transmogrified version of the same idea. There is more characterisation evident here. Danny and Walter are two very realistic brothers, who argue over the slightest things, but the able playing by the actors ensures precocity is kept at bay.The film adds a level of realism to their relationship through the inclusion of a dysfunctional family unit. Their parents are separated, and there are times when they blame each other for that, even though they know deep down that it isn't true. It's not surprising the writing is so sharp with David Koepp handling the screenplay.Also Zathura is a very exciting film with a lot of great special effects undercut by a sly, infectious humour. Such as their sister Lisa who is also in the house, and accidentally gets caught up in the game when ZATHURA freezes her for a number of turns. There is some great slapstick humour to be had when the two boys have to move her frozen body and it goes sliding down the stairs.The effects are top notch, better than Jumanji's. One moment that springs to mind is when they first realise they're in outer space. There is a dazzling image of considerable beauty when they open the front door and the vastness of space is out there. A lot of the spatial phenomena is handled well, especially the wormhole at the end. A scene that quite takes one's breath away.But there is also a retro look to some of the things that emerge. Like the robot coming out with slogans that wouldn't have been out of place in Lost in Space or Forbidden Planet. Or rocket ships that have none of the sleek, streamlined finish they have nowadays. I'm sure this would elicit fond memories of nostalgia from older members of the audience.Zathura is not strictly a kids film. It manages to generate real moments of suspense, such as the sound of the robot coming, or the meteor shower destroying everything. Some of the science-fiction doesn't quite hold water though. They're in space, but there's gravity inside the house, oxygen, and nobody gets sucked out into space when the doors and windows are open. Unless it's some form of protection afforded by the game, but since it seems so insistent on placing them in danger, you wonder why it would bother with aliens and robots to do the job when all it would have to do is let the vacuum of space in.But I suppose it's easy to ignore plot holes in light of Zathura's entertainment value. There is some fine ensemble playing from the cast, including an astronaut in the game who helps fight off the dangers of ZATHURA. He has a rugged Captains Courageous characteristic to him, and the truth of his identity brings a shocking twist to the exciting climax.Zathura is first class entertainment. An under-appreciated gem with lots to enjoy, and a fine example of how one film with an identical plot line can be adapted into something quite different.",Zathura - A Space Adventure

The idea of a house floating in space is cool. The Zorgon alien monsters is very cool. Just like Jumanji, Zathura has cool effects and creature designs. It's full of warmth, humor and cool monsters. What you expect from the people that brought you Jumanji. You all know what I feel about that, nothing but good things if you don't know. On the negative side, like Jumanji I think it would have been fun to find out who made Zathura and how it came to be under the stairs and the bickering brothers got annoying at times.

Unless you are watching this to have something to watch with a 10 year old, you really wont achieve the full potential of this movie.This is basically a rehash of jumanji- a game that once you start, you have to keep playing till the end and you don't know what hell will break loose when you take your turn, but you have to take your turn to make progress towards finishing the game.

The younger brother is very cute and lovely. It has the thrill of jumanji but not fun maybe because of Robin Williams absence. Only drawback was its predictable.

78,stormhawk2021,Jumanji meets Star Wars,5,14 January 2018,"Following the storyline of the fast-paced ""Jumanji"" (1995), ten years after, we get this ""Zathura, a Space Adventure"". And it is impossible to not make comparisons. Two movies A very real game. And some characters forced to play to survive. If in the Robin Williams' film a whole jungle came out of the board, in this adaptation of the story of the same author who inspired ""Jumanji"", mixing with ""The Goonies"" (1985), we go to outer space, with all the meteorites, cryogenic cameras, lost astronauts and alien bugs that this entails.But unlike his older sister, successive runs are happening without much noise, without getting in almost no time to hook the viewer or make him feel some empathy towards the characters. Another weak point of this new incursion in too real games, the characters. While in ""Jumanji"" we had two adults who put some adventure and seriousness to the game, here the two young protagonists are limited to running, shouting, fighting, and in certain final moments to give us a moralistic mania about the relationship between two brothers.The right special effects to be a movie for children. The vision of space following the trail of any science fiction movie, achieved without further ado. The intervention of Tim Robbins, wasted, but of course, that could be expected. It seems that he is there to do a favor for the director, or for his children to see him in a film intended for all audiences.In short, this new version that we wanted to sell taking advantage of the charm that had ""Jumanji"" in its time, is a failed attempt to resuscitate the myth that this was, a simple entertainment only suitable for children. They will enjoy it.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
79,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,"too similar to Jumanji to be regarded on its own....otherwise, it's a fun family film that the kids will love",6,1 April 2006,"'Zathura' is basically 1995's smash hit 'Jumanji' in space. You will notice striking similarities between the films that I will go into in a moment. First off, Zathura is a great family film, possessing every element that makes a good family film: minimal violence, minimal language, funny one liners, cool visual effects, and a cool turn at the end. There are a few bad words that some ears shouldn't hear, including d*ck, a*s, and in a stretched out way, b**ch (I'm saying this as a precaution for you parents who dislike the language for your kids). I was a little shocked to hear it, but coming from Jon Favreau, I shouldn't have been surprised. Favreau's direction is good, as he makes the chemistry between the film's two main characters, Danny and Walter.The plot goes as follows: after having a brotherly dispute, Walter sends his little brother, Danny, into the basement. While down there, Danny finds an old board game called Zathura: A Space Adventure. Danny takes the game to his brother, who rudely says he doesn't want to play, and plays by himself. After moving some spaces, a meteor shower erupts in the house. I will repeat that. A METEOR shower erupts in the HOUSE. After this, the kids realize that they are in outer space, and that they must finish the horrific game if they want to get home. After that, the game ensues to freeze their teenage sister, and send a vicious robot on them, not to mention send a mysterious astronaut (the very funny Dax Shepard) to them, one whom has been in space for 15 years....The bad things about how similar it is to Jumanji. I mean, yes, three or four things are okay, but there are so many similarities, it's a bit ridiculous. For example, on the third turn in Jumanji, a lion comes out of the game, and Robin Williams manages to lock it in a room. In Zathura, the robot comes out on the third turn, and the boys manage to lock it in a room. Also, as with Jumanji, a character will attempt to cheat. Another significant parallel is that the game is stolen, and that they must retrieve it from a conveyor belt type object before it reaches the end. In Jumanji, it's a waterfall, and in this, it's an actual conveyor belt with fire at the end. Now, I'm done nearly spoiling the movie (laugh).Jon Favreau has given a fun film that the whole family will like, but has unfortunately strayed way too close in terms of the script and dialog (one or two lines are the same as well) of the 1995 action/thriller Jumanji. I enjoyed it, but I just can't think of Zathura without thinking of Jumanji, and sadly, you probably will too.6/10 --spy",Zathura - A Space Adventure
80,Jay_Exiomo,Good but not out-of-this-world good,7,25 January 2006,"Danny (Jonah Bobo) and Walter (Josh Hutcherson) are two brothers who never can seem to be at peace with each other. Left alone one afternoon in the house with their older sister (Kristen Stewart) while their father (Tim Robbins in a small role) goes to a meeting, Danny hits Walter with a baseball on the head and a mad chase ensues. This leads to Danny stumbling upon Zathura - a magical game board set in space just as Jumanji was set in the jungle.Based on the book by Chris Van Allsburg (""Jumanji"", ""The Polar Express""), ""Zathura"" is obviously aimed more towards the younger members of the audience. After all, the entire film is about a board game. But with director Jon Favreau having a good hand at telling the story and some nice help from the special effects department, the viewer is effectively thrust into a child's imagination.While by no means a great film, ""Zathura"" is still enjoyable despite running for almost two hours as it is fast-paced, and the two boys in the lead characters are good. Bobo does well as Danny, while Hutcherson (who previously appeared as the lovestruck 10-year old in ""Little Manhattan"") is good as Walter. What's more is that both actors act with such maturity and chemistry with each other that further strengthen their roles.Although I could have done without much of the first part of the movie that attempts to put a footnote on the ongoing rivalry between the two brothers, once the game starts the film moves at a fast pace with the ominous meteor shower commencing the proceedings and a sequence with the carnivorous Zorgons capping it. The film though does slow down again going into the end to inject some message.Overall this is a worthy entry to the genre. While it may not have been the best film to have come out of Allsburg's imagination, it certainly does a good enough job of translating it.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
81,robert-710-767167,"Interesting concept, put together nicely",8,15 March 2011,"A story about two boys who are brothers, who just can't get along. One of them is 10, the other 6 3/4. They have a sister who I'm guessing is around 15-16. The father is divorced and has the three kids. The father needs to leave and go to a meeting. The boys cannot get along, and they fight. The sister is a stereotypical teenager girl who's perfect and refuses to acknowledge her brothers because it's not cool.The story goes that the youngest boy finds a board game in their old basement, and takes it out. This board game is not like other board games. It spits out a card per each player's turn (after they move) and the card gives typical instructions for the game play. However, here's where it's unique. The board game's events occur in real life. Example being meteor shower, take cover. A real meteor shower hits the house.It goes on for two or so hours with the boys having to cooperate, they meet a friendly astronaut, a few nasty aliens, a robot, and of course their sister gets involved near the end. I really liked the unique plot this story brought. The way they pulled it off (teamwork, and the surprise near the end where the astronaut is really from the future, being one of the brothers as an older guy) was quite well done.I rate this 8/10 because of it's message, the way it pulled me in, etc. There were a few swears, but it wasn't nasty. 1/10 is removed because it's the type of movie that makes you jump.

82,ScottDMenzel,"""Zathura"" is a very exciting, fun film with terrific special effects that is much better than the trailer leads you believe.",7,12 November 2005,"Two Brothers, Danny (Jonah Bobo) and Walter (Josh Hutcherson) are left alone in the house while their dad (Tim Robbins) goes to work. Walter and Danny get into a fight and Walter puts Danny in the basement. This is where Danny finds a board game called Zathura, which is a space adventure board game. It isn't long before Danny's curiosity takes over and insists that Danny should try to play Zathura. But one push of the button starts the game and this is no ordinary board game but an actual space adventure game that cannot be stopped until either Danny or Walter win the game! A very fun and exciting adventure lies ahead""Zathura"" is one of those hidden gems that you would never think was good from reading about it and seeing the commercials and trailers for it. When I first saw the trailer, I said ""oh gees give me a break!"" and had no desire to see the film what so ever probably because I really didn't care for ""Jumanji"" and ""Zathura"" seemed similar and was written by the same writer. But luckily I did go see it and in fact, really enjoyed the film.Now first things first, this is a big budget Hollywood family flick so don't expect any amazing dialogue or acting! But what ""Zathura"" does offer is great special effects, a pretty exciting and interesting story and decent acting. The movie actually blew me away with the special effects because I actually never heard about this film until a month or so ago so I was amazed the movie looked as good as it did because I figured this was a pretty low budget family flick. The whole space settings and the creatures and robots in outer space were very cool and looked just as good as say ""Jurassic Park."" ""Zathura"" is basically a two men show, and by two men I mean the two brothers Danny and Walter played by Jonah Bobo and Josh Hutcherson who both do very well in their roles.. Jonah Bobo was actually better than Josh in my opinion but maybe it's because his character was more likable then Josh's. In minor supporting roles we have Dax Shepard who does a decent job, Kristen Stewart who was decent as well but after seeing her in ""Speak"" I believe she needs to keep to the independent roles because she's one of hell of an actress and lastly we have Tim Robbins who like usual does a great job. Not much to complain about with the acting, it's a little cheesy sometimes but hey it's a family film and a Hollywood one at that so it's bound to be a little cheesy.Jon Favreau was the director of this film and I must say the man has a knack for directing films. Jon's first hit film was ""Elf"" which came out in 2003. Again ""Elf"" was a huge surprise to me which I also really enjoyed. What I like about Favreau's direction is that he tends to make films that can appeal to both kids and adults. He's kind of like the live version of Pixar. He picks good scripts and does one hell of a job bringing them to life. I also like how ""Zathura"" was a lot different from ""Elf"" and the fact that he nailed the film on the head. Sometimes directors tend to be one hit wonders or have problems changing the story or the cast, not with Favreau he knows what he is doing and he will be around for a long time as a director.So to sum it up, ""Zathura"" is a good family film that both children and adults alike can enjoy. The movie is definitely not for really little kids I would say this movie is more suitable for kids ages 7 and up. The movie contains amazing special effects and very interesting and exciting story which is sure to amuse most who watch the film. Also this film is a lot better then its predecessor ""Jumanji"" and really is better than the trailers make you believe. I had a fun time when I saw the film; it's a pretty unique family film that still has a good moral lesson at the end. I recommend this film and will purchase the DVD when it hits stores.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Zathura"" is an 8/10. It's a brainless but fun big budget family flick!",Zathura - A Space Adventure

I didn't expect anything from the child actors but they were not bad.I don't recommend it ever. It may be good to those who haven't seen Jumanji but overall it isn't good.

84,pinkarray,Entertaining movie but has negative things,7,3 January 2017,"Walter is a know-it-all ten-year-old to his brother and it bothers me how badly he mistreats his brother. The two brothers fighting can get irritating.Danny is 6 years old, using a curse word and acts way more mature than a 6 year old. He constantly whines and refuses to play the game so that he can go home, which makes the story more boring and forgettable.There is also curse words used from 14-year-old Kristen Stewart, who also wears skimpy clothes, lazes about, and doesn't care about anything but her date. There are also hints of sexuality between her and the astronaut, (who turns out to actually be her brother).These three main characters are stupid and selfish. I know, there are some kids out there who act like these characters but that doesn't excuse my opinion that they are stereotypical. The writer is in control of the screenplay, they can succeed in making the characters more unique and likable. Though, there is some cleverness to this movie, the characters still make the movie a bit harder to watch.I don't really mind something like Jumanji, but this is way too much like Jumanji but in space with aliens and robots. At least create a plot twist.There is not a whole lot of suspense or destruction to it. It's kind of written like a bad fanfic by some 11-year-old kid. The kids set things right and make it back home where everything is somehow back to normal?The kids did an OK job at portraying fearful faces, Kristen Stewart is OK as the girl with a crush on the astronaut, the other characters perform natural performances. However, it may have been the directors' fault that the three kids had fake performances.There are some positives to it, there is quite a lot of action to it, breathtaking music and some slapstick humor. I still like the movie even though there's nothing new to be found here. It was fun and I might like to re-watch it again.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
85,cshep,Highly Imaginative and Entertaining !!!,9,16 November 2005,"Jon Favreau directs this Highly Imaginative and Entertaining tale of two Brothers as they unwittingly become trapped in the game of Zathura .Favreau taps into the psyche of pre-teens as he takes the viewer on a space ride of enormous proportion !Danny (Jonah Bobo) the younger brother and Walter(Josh Hutcherson) are dysfunctional siblings, who have rival issues due to the split of their parents. Constantly arguing and battling over territorial rights , Danny finds a game in the basement, Zathura , When Danny starts playing Zathura in the living room, a card appears from the game, warning of a meteor shower, and then it starts raining fireballs in the house, and the game is on. Danny and Walter explore the house ,and they find that they are floating in the rings of Saturn .The children deduce that the only solution is to play the game and win , to return their home to earth ,Unfortunately , it isn't that easy, for each time they press the button and advance, another card comes up and a different scenario ensues. There is even a Robot , is he good or bad ?????Even though you know that winning the game has to happen for a complete resolution, the movie takes many twists and turns , and the boys start to bond, to defeat the many situations that they face .Some harsh language and contrived scenes but still evenly paced .I thoroughly enjoyed this film , but I would not recommend it for children under 10 , for there are many tense and emotional moments, that center around the vastness of space and the villains that they encounter, Zorgons.A terrific film that will make you forget Jumanji(which is forgettable), the plot device is the same but the movies are not comparable .Interesting Twist at the End , kids will ""GET"" it ! So take the afternoon off, get the kids, and have a great time exploring the Universe, with ""Zathura"" , a GREAT adventure with the ""E"" ticket ride .I gave it a 9 for originality, imagination,art direction, and a fine directing by Favreau , he must have been a kid once .",Zathura - A Space Adventure

87,RhapsodyReviews,A Fun Adventure.,7,27 December 2019,"Review:
'Zathura: A Space Adventure' is a science fiction-adventure film directed by Jon Favreau. It is an adaptation of the children's book 'Zathura' by Chris Van Allsburg, author of 'Jumanji' and is considered the second installment of the 'Jumanji' franchise
Jumanji was a board game that once you started playing it would transport a savage jungle along with all its beasts and perils right into your living room. With Zathura we get the same basic idea, only this time around the adventure transports us into space. And all the alien creatures, spaceships, meteor showers and malfunctioning robots that come along with it.
After their father is called into work, two young boys, Walter (Josh Hutcherson) and Danny (Jonah Bobo), are left in the care of their teenage sister, Lisa (Kristen Stewart), and told they must stay inside. Walter and Danny, who anticipate a boring day, are shocked when they begin playing Zathura, a space-themed board game, which they realize has mystical powers when their house is shot into space. With the help of an astronaut, the boys attempt to return home.
The acting in good enough to bring this film together. It's nothing award worthy, but for a fun adventure comedy is exactly what is needed. What elevates this film is the believable interactions of the two young players. Jonah Bobo plays the six-year-old Danny, who is always getting in the way of his older brother, ten-year-old Walter, played by Josh Hutcherson. Danny is looking for friendship and attention from his brother, who in turn considers Danny to be a pest and a nuisance, competing for the attention of their recently divorced father, played by Tim Robbins. Dax Sheppard is great as the rescued Astronaut and delivers the comedic relief this film needs perfectly.
The movie does a great job of not relying too heavily on CGI; very thoughtful design and effects. The convincing use of miniatures, real sets and chaos/destruction really brought the story to life.
Overall, this movie is funny and exciting, but it's never preachy. It has a motive that it brings forward with the story telling. 'Zathura: A Space Adventure' is intelligently written and directed, this is a great family film.

90,spacemonkey_fg,Way better then Jumanji,10,22 February 2006,"Title: Zathura (2005) Director: Jon Favreau Review: You know the type of movie that you watch when you are a little kid and you never forget that film and hold it close to your heart for all your life? For me it was all about The Goonies and Explorers. Zathura is going to end up being one of those movies for a whole new generation of kids growing up right now.Zathura is just a variation of what we saw earlier in Jumanji. Jumanji was a board game that once you started playing it would transport a savage jungle along with all its beasts and perils right into your living room. With Zathura we get the same basic idea, only this time around the adventure transports us into space. And all the alien creatures, spaceships, meteor showers and malfunctioning robots that come along with it.There's a couple of things I liked better about this film then Jumanji. For example with Jumanji you got all these special effects and all these creatures and things happening, but to me personally the film always seemed a little empty. It didn't show anything to kids. It just felt like this empty shell of a movie with lots of razzle dazzle effects. And heres where Zathura improved on the whole idea: this movie had a whole lot more to say then Jumanji ever did.With Zathura you get these two little brothers. One is six and one is ten. So naturally they are always fighting for attention and are in a constant competition to see who is best, who is first and who their dad loves the most. Once they get going on their space adventure they will learn to value and care for each other. And their bond as brothers grow. So yeah, Zathura has a lot more to teach to kids and has an actual message as opposed to Jumanjis empty effects.But on top of that you get some kick ass action and adventure. And this is the part where I said, man some little kid somewhere is LOVING this movie. There was a lot of care taken to make this movie not just a preachy movie about loving your family and brothers..but an entertaining film as well. With some cool special effects too boot. You gotta love the giant malfunctioning robot, you gotta love those lizard like aliens called the Zorgons. I liked the fact that Hollywood didn't say, ah, its a kid movie, they wont notice. The effects here are top of the line cool stuff.The performances by the two kids were great. I loved the fact that they seemed real. Kids fight like this, they talk to each other in this way. And the kids at the same time weren't annoying in the least. They acted very naturally and non of their acting felt forced or fake. Tim Robbins makes a cameo as the dad of the kids.So in conclusion, if you have kids rent this movie and watch it with them. Theyll learn something in the process and you'll go back to being that ten year old kid saying cool every five minutes. Its a win win situation.Rating: 5 out of 5",Zathura - A Space Adventure

Their parents are divorced for, reasons, and they have an older sister for, reasons. The two kids are left to themselves. older kid ignores younger kid. younger kid finds a game and starts to play. The game is a space type game, and starting the game turns the house they are in into a spaceship. As they take turns playing the game, a card spits out and then it starts to play out in real life. For example, ""meteor shower"" turns into a bunch of meteors crashing through the house.Each turn becomes an issue they have to deal with. There's a robot that malfunctions and think they are alien life forms that need to be killed. There's a ship of lizard aliens trying to burn down the home. There's an astronaut that helps the kids further the plot. The ultimate goal is to finish the game, at which point, the game would reset.The older sister plays a bit of comic relief. For the first half-ish of the movie, she's either sleeping or frozen (an outcome of one of the turns). I thought they'd find increasingly crazy ways to keep her out of the main plot, but she eventually enters the game (haha).The twist: Turns out the astronaut was the older version of the older kid. He got stuck in the game because he wished his younger brother didn't exist. This being a two player game, that meant he couldn't continue.Anyway, after they complete the game, everything goes back to normal and the two boys are now BFFs. Everyone lives happily ever after and big sis says to ""never speak of this again"".Bottom line, it's probably a fun movie if you're a kid, and absolutely nothing wrong with fun movies for kids. For me though, it felt a bit sluggish at points, and more than a few times, I was thinking to myself, ""just take your turn!"". 6/10, maybe 8/10 if I were a younger kid.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
95,jaredd,Generally slow and boring,5,17 January 2021,"I'm here because of John Favreau's work on The Mandalorian. I wanted to see what he's done in the past. Well, I don't consider this film to be that good. Is it all the director's fault? I don't think so, but he must carry some of the blame.The primary issue that jumped out at me was that the actors in general just weren't up to the task, especially the kids. Now I know it's going to be a challenge for them, but your job as director is to be able to tell when things are coming across correctly for viewers. The believability about what was going on around them just didn't fly. Probably what needed to happen was a recasting with slightly older kids or get better child actors. No offense to the kids because what the film asks of them is a tall order.Ultimately at some point in the film I just didn't care any more about what was happening because the actors weren't conveying anything realistic and the film didn't bother to explain what was going on.Some other gripes:
The ""drama"" between the kids was completely overdone and dragged out far too long.
Kristen Stewart was the only interesting character and she's AWOL most of the film.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
96,gpeltz,Wonderful adventure,8,19 November 2005,"It is rare when a movie transports me back to my childhood memories, reminding me of the time when playing games use to be fun. Adventures were limited by imagination, and Summer days were transformed into magic. ""Zathura"", directed by Jon Favreau, based on a book by Chris Van Allsburg, came knocking on my door and invited me to come out and play.Author/Artist, Van Allsburg has a wonderful gift. His vision is firmly planted in a realm of childhood experiences. More illustration than words, his books evoke worlds of wonder. The last movie based on one of his stories was, ""The Polar Express"" directed by Zemeckis. It is making it's re appearance as a seasonal movie. It is well worth seeing, and if you can find it in IMAX 3-D, it is phenomenal.Van Allsburg's book, ""Jumanji"" was filmed less successfully back in 1995. It failed because it could not find the right tone. Zathura nails it. Both books share the same plot device; Children find a board game that transports them into the game. Cards are drawn that effect their fate and their surroundings. The only way to escape the perils of the game, is to play it through. Jumanji was a jungle game and Zathura is a space adventure.What elevates this film is the believable interactions of the two young players. Jonah Bobo plays the six year old Danny, who is always getting in the way of his older brother, ten year old Walter, played by Josh Hutcherson. Danny is looking for friendship and attention from his brother, who in turn considers Danny to be a pest and a nuisance, competing for the attention of their recently divorced father, played by Tim Robbins.The boys have an older sister Lisa, played by Kristen Stewart. She is living in a world of her own, between her preening and dating, the boys hardly see her. Although she does join the game late in the film, for most of the film she is cryogenically indisposed.The Game itself is a marvel of brightly painted tin and wind up gears. To play is simple, wind it up, push a button and watch a number come up, this determines the number of spaces your playing piece will take. Two rockets chase each other around the twisting path. After your piece moves, a card pops up. The card describes the action to follow. Danny draws the first card that says, ""Meteor Shower, Take Evasive Action"" and the game is on.The movie is visually stunning. The discovery by the children, that their house has been transported to a location in outer space, hovering above a ring of meteors that encircle a large planet, is jaw dropping. The effects are real enough to imply danger, but logic is not a function of children's games, so it does not matter that oxygen, gravity and warmth still exist in the house, even as it is blasted apart by various forces.Along the way the boys encounter a young astronaut played by Dax Shepard, who helps them out of perilous situations like battling engulfing black holes, and evading Fierce carnivorous lizards called Zorgons. Along the way the Astronaut teaches them lessons in brotherly cooperation, and even beguiles Lisa into sharing the adventure. While funny and exciting, it is never preachy, Zathura is intelligently written and directed, this is a great family film. I give it **** out of five stars.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
97,leilapostgrad,Austin Movie Show review - funny and believable,7,12 November 2005,"""Would you like to swing on a star, carry moonbeams home in a jar, and be better off than you are, or would you rather go to Earth?"" Remember that song? It was from an 80s sitcom about a girl who would talk with her alien father through that crystal thing? I think it was called Out of This World. Anyhoo, I thought of that song while I watched Zathura at Fantastic Fest last month at the Alamo Drafthouse. I'm sure my slight intoxication added to my enjoyment of this film, but I did enjoy Zathura nonetheless (and I'm sure I would enjoy it sober, too). It's a sweet, funny, and exciting family movie that kids will totally relate to and parents will even get a chuckle out of.In Zathura, two young brothers, Danny (Jonah Bobo) and Walter (Josh Hutcherson) start playing a board game that sends them and their entire house into space. That may sound goofy, but this movie is so well done that you can't help but believe it. Ultimately, it's a lot of fun, and it might even make some kids think twice about how they treat their little brothers or sisters. As a youngest child myself, I can totally relate to the youngest brother, Danny, who just wants his older brother, Walter, to play with him. Is that really asking so much? Hopefully other kids will watch Zathura and learn to get along with their siblings before being hurdled into space. But even if they don't learn that lesson, at least they'll have fun at the theater.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
98,Movieguy_blogs_com,I though the visuals in this movie were first rate and there was a good moral to the story.,6,8 November 2005,"In 'Zathura' Jonah Bobo plays Danny, a kid who is being ignored. He just wants some attention but his older brother (Josh Hutcherson) does not want to play with him, his dad (Tim Robbins) is too busy, and his sister (Kristen Stewart) has other things to do. But once he finds a board game called 'Zathura' down in the basement, his family starts to take notice.In this movie, Danny and his brother and sister (and the house) get drawn into a sci-fi adventure that takes them across the galaxy. With the help of a stranded astronaut (Dax Shepard) the family are able to make it to Zathura before dad gets home.I was not a big fan of 'Jumanji' (another book by Chris Van Allsburg) and 'Zathura' did not impress me much either. I though the visuals in this movie were first rate and there was a good moral to the story. However, it really dragged on in parts and took to long to get its point across. Plus, I did not think the aliens were very believable.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
99,paulo20,Oxygen in Space,3,30 May 2010,"Wow, this film just wasn't very good. Nothing wrong with the visual aspect, that I noticed, and the basic premise seems to be a sound one, but its execution and just about everything else about this movie stunk. You probably know the premise (JUMANJI in space), so no need for me to go over it. But I bet you didn't know that there's oxygen in space. Or so this movie would have you believe. Aliens and a robot move around and about the house and liberally smash great big holes into the house but the inhabitants, two boys and their elder sister can breath just fine. One might chalk this up to this being a fantasy or some such, if not for the fact that the characters themselves make a point about the concern about air. Also, at one point, a couch is set on fire, set loose into deep space and continues burning, blithely unaware of the laws of physics.As for the acting, the two boys and teenage girl are grating and their acting is not very good but I blame this on a terrible script. The actors do the best they can with the lines given.As for the plot, it's just an exercise in random events. Let me cite a few examples. At one point, the game produces a gold card, granting the player a wish. What does the kid wish for, while they're flying around, lost in space, with a murderous robot in the basement, and aliens blowing firing laser cannons at their house, and they're constantly screaming at each other at the top of their lungs? He wishes for a football, signed by Brett Favre. No, really.But the stupidity doesn't stop there. The sister quickly develops a crush on the Astronaut, a man who got rescued from space as a result of the boys playing the game. This Astronaut reveals to the older brother that he too played the game, got a gold card and wished his brother were never born. Thus he strongly cautions the the boy about what he wishes for (before he wishes for a football). This is significant because, later in the game, the same kid gets another gold card. This time he wishes for the Astronaut's brother to come back...And then, we have a ""twist."" The vanished brother is none other than the younger brother. The Astronaut is none other than the older brother aged about 20 years and trapped in space from playing Zathura. The movie does nothing to explain this odd paradox (or anything else for that matter); you're just meant to accept it.Of course, we're also either asked to accept or expected to forget that the Astronaut wasn't able to recognize his younger brother, nor his younger self, nor the sister who had a crush on him (btw, we're meant to find this particular development humorous). The only twist here is in the movie's logic.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
100,GTeixeira,'Jumanji' in space,5,6 July 2014,"'Zathura' is based on another of Chris Van Allsburg's books, from the same series as 'Jumanji'. However, this film is not meant to be connected with 1995's 'Jumanji'... despite being pretty much the same thing, only the game now has a space motif rather than a jungle one.Maybe it's a fault of Van Allsburg's novel, or just laziness from the director/screenwriters. Nearly everything, from the sibling dynamic, a man lost in time in the game, a being within the game chasing the lost man, the whole thing being a kind of morality play... It feels just too similar for me.Of course, there is no Robin Williams this time. It has, however, a not-yet-famous Kristen Stewart: her character has little to no importance plot-wise, and from what I get it wasn't even in the book. She is meant to be little more than a minor comic relief, and doesn't do much really.'Zathura' has very good visuals and a fantasy-like quality that might really enchant younger children, that's sure; maybe even provide for some fun for older audiences as well. On the other hand, while the sibling relationship is done quite realistically and their fighting is consistent with children their age, watching such childish yelling and arguing gets irritating after a certain point.Some points of the film are a bit too childish, even for a fantasy film; like the children's wishes when prompted by the game. Most of the situations seem like any other child adventure film, in a tried-and-true format that tries to invoke some charm. The actors aren't really great, mostly doing just enough for their roles to work but nothing more.In the end, 'Zathura' is mostly a film for younger audiences. For me, it did little to nothing: not really a waste of time, but not great either. However, 'Jumanji' did leave a strong impression in my childhood and retains some nostalgia power to this day: maybe 'Zathura' can repeat that aspect with younger audiences, as well?",Zathura - A Space Adventure
101,TEAQUIEMORO,A Cool Space Adventure,9,3 November 2006,"This was a very nice but a fun movie to see, it brought back Jumanje into our future. This space adventure will literally blow your mind out, a simple plot that they take it and make it beyond unusual.

And such great working actors to the movie, they all did a good job, even the wee kids.I would recommend that you should see this movie to a Video Store near you, this movie is two thumbs way up, so go see it and I'm sure you will not be disappointed when seeing it.9/10",Zathura - A Space Adventure
102,eichelbergersports,Basically a warmed-over 'Jumanji',5,1 November 2005,"""Zathura,"" directed by Jon Favreau (""Elf""), is basically a sequel to the 1995 Robin Williams' hit, ""Jumanji,"" in which two children begin playing a simple board game with unintended and often disastrous consequences.Without Williams and co-star Bonnie Hunt, ""Jumanji"" would have been nothing but a series of mediocre special effects. Without ANY well-known lead to hold ""Zathura"" together, that's just what this feature becomes - some pretty good FX and CGI, but little in the story department for viewers to connect with or get excited about. Of course, the inevitable comparison of the two pictures is unavoidable.The 1995 film had (along with two strong leads, and two very good supporting children), a compelling plot to carry us along with the frantic effects. There is little in that department to guide us in this current release, which takes place in space as opposed to the dense African jungle.Little Danny (Jonah Bobo) is either picked on or neglected by his big brother, Walter (Josh Hutcherson, ""Kicking & Screaming""), all the while trying to get the attention of his well-meaning father (Tim Robbins), a graphic designer of some sort. Danny is a dreamer, but no one else in the family seems to get his allusions, so he's often discarded forced to play by himself.With his dad heading off to an important meeting one afternoon, and the boys left in the care of their bored and careless older sister, Lisa (Kristen Stewart, ""Cold Creek Manor""), you know trouble cannot be far off. Especially when Danny digs up an old board game, Zathura, from his cellar (after being sent down there in a dumb waiter by Walter).Like the Jumangi game, this tin contraption takes on a life of its own after the player winds a key and pushes the ""start"" button. Danny does this, and his toy ship moves to a designated space, at which time a card pops out.These cards give clues to what's coming up next. Some are pretty obvious (""Your robot is defective"" or ""Rescue the stranded astronaut""), while others are cryptic (""Reprogram""). Rest assured, however, that when the first card is revealed, the entire reality of the situation changes. Soon the whole house (and a large chunk of property upon which it sits) is catapulted into the cold black void of unforgiving space, there forced to do battle, not only with the elements, but with hostile aliens, as well.Of course it isn't really THAT unforgiving, considering.You'll have to suspend your disbelief long enough to ignore the fact that the kids can breathe normally and that zero gravity is no problem to them as they walk about normally, but that's okay, I can deal with that. I can also accept that the building gets almost totally destroyed by the end of the picture, but we know if the two boys can just finish the game, everything will return to normal - just like ""Jumanji."" In their travels through this frightening scenario, Danny, Walter and Lisa meet a handsome astronaut (Dax Shepard, ""Without A Paddle""), who helps the kids fight the evil, lizard-like Zorgon terror, and then disappears with a startling revelation. The boys are forced to use their own wits and resources most of the time, as well as receiving valuable aid from a large robot that reminds one of those toys manufactured in the 1950s.The movie will probably make a lot of young boys happy, what with all of the special effects and space stuff flying about (the scene when the boys first discover they are amidst the rings of Saturn is pretty spectacular), and the two young boy leads are competent and attractive, but the bottom line is this is still pretty much a warmed-over ""Jumanji."" And, as long as that film is still available, why choose this lesser version?",Zathura - A Space Adventure
103,xsophietaylorx,really enjoyable,8,14 October 2014,I remember watching this film and really enjoying it I was only around seven or eight and I really liked it. All my life I have been fond of Dax Sheppard & Josh Hutcherson and they both have roles in this movie. The plot of the whole film is good and entertaining it's an intense adventure and you don't want to take your eyes off the movie for a minute just in case you miss something. The story is different a lot like Jumanji but different. All though it will never ever be as good as Jumanji it has earned it's own rank up there in good adventure movies it's great for kids and adults both. It has humour and some emotional scenes in it. The film is just over all great fun for everyone it's enjoyable and not a waste of your time in the end it has a weird twist and does teach some lessons.,Zathura - A Space Adventure

The two are struggling to find brotherly peace, when a mysterious board game discovered in the creepy basement launches the pair, their sister, and the house itself, into deep alien-infested space. Walter and Danny must win the game to reset their lives and with the help of a stranded astronaut (who has a not so secret, for anyone with a keen eye and a plethora of films under their belt) and their grumpy teenage sister. The staging of this film is clean and simple, and keeps to the inside of the house, maintaining a nice enclosed environment for the adventure to play out. As such, the sets are simple and leave room for the fun special effects of outer space and the aliens that eventually infiltrate the house.

105,LadyLiberty,"Zathura is Unreal, but Really Fun",6,13 November 2005,"There were a couple of movies I really wanted to see this weekend, and surprisingly, one of them was Zathura. While the trailers were intriguing, the early buzz about the film was even better. Obviously aimed at a very youthful market  the kind of thing I don't typically care for, frequented by audiences I care even less for  my one concession was to go to a very late night showing in the hopes there would be few if any small children in the theatre. The movie (and, frankly, the showtime) turned out to be a good choice.In the opening scenes of Zathura, we meet Danny (Jonah Bobo) and Walter (Josh Hutcherson), two brothers who can't  not even for a few minutes  get along. The pair fight incessantly, and vie non-stop for the attention of their harried father (Tim Robbins). Even when Dad tries to intervene, Walter can't hide his contempt for his little brother, and Danny can't stop antagonizing him.It's a Saturday afternoon, and although their father doesn't want to work, he's got no choice but to go to his office for a brief while. Knowing better than to leave the boys to their own devices, he leaves them in the charge of their teen-aged sister, Lisa (Kristen Stewart). Lisa, of course, would just as soon sleep as so much as acknowledge her younger brothers' presence.While Lisa naps, yet another fight erupts. With Walter's limited patience well over its limit, Danny knows he'd better hide! Alone in the basement, he sees a colorful box hidden under the stairs. In large and inviting letters, the box says ""Zathura."" Forgetting how angry Walter probably still is, Danny grabs the box and runs off to show his brother. In the hopes that Walter might play with him, Danny opens the game and takes the first turn. A card pops out of a slot in the game. ""Meteor shower,"" the card says. ""Take evasive action."" Walter reluctantly helps Danny read the card. No sooner has he done so than a meteor shower begins. In their living room. And with all of the accompanying destruction you might expect from such an event. Taking evasive action seems like good advice, and so the boys hide in the fireplace until the storm is over. It's then that they discover something even more astounding: their house is floating in space around some unnamed ringed planet. And the only way they can get back home is to keep playing Zathura until somebody wins.Jonah Bobo is good; Josh Hutcherson is even better. It's a good thing that's the case because the two largely carry this movie on their small shoulders alone! Tim Robbins is there at the beginning and again at the end; Kristen Stewart contributes ably now and then. But Zathura almost exclusively focuses on the boys and their struggle to get along and to get back home. At one point, the pair are aided in their quest by the mysterious rescued astronaut (Dax Shepard) who proves an excellent foil for the melodramatic kids, but his role, too, is secondary to that of the boys.Director Jon Favreau probably remains better known in front of the camera than behind it (he's played various supporting roles in a number of films), but don't be fooled: this is the man with the wonderful Elf on his directing résumé. With Zathura, he's taken an entirely different twist on the fantasy genre, but again, he's done it very well. The special effects are good; the sets are excellent. The script is deceptively simple while conveying warmth, humor, and the very real relationship between two brothers.Yes, Zathura is complete and unrealistic fantasy. No, it doesn't obey even the most rudimentary of the laws of physics. As science fiction goes, it's all fiction and no science. But you know, in the middle of a Zorgon attack or a lost astronaut rescue, it doesn't really matter. Whatever its lack of realism, Zathura is fun and exciting to watch. I don't necessarily go to the movies to learn something. I go to be entertained. And watching Zathura, I most thoroughly was.FAMILY SUITABILITY: Zathura is rated PG for ""fantasy action and peril, and some language."" Although I don't really see much of a problem with the language, I do believe that some of the peril is going to prove too much for little ones. I found myself getting nervous a few times, and for a movie as implausible as Zathura is, that's saying something! As a whole, I'd say Zathura would be great for kids about age 7 or 8 and up. And if you go with them, I strongly suspect you won't regret having bought a ticket for yourself.",Zathura - A Space Adventure

107,sullibrandon,A Great Family Flick,8,13 February 2006,"I saw this movie only because I had a free ticket to it from purchasing the Jumanji special edition. I wasn't planning on seeing it at all - honestly, to me it looked kind of dumb. However I'm glad I did see it, because it was better than I expected.The movie is basically about two brothers finding a magical board game called Zathura....it's like Jumanji only in space. At first this may sound kind of dumb (I know to me it did), but the storyline is actually quite captivating. Both child actors pull of their role as brothers quite well....having a younger brother myself I found I could identify with much of the sibling rivalry shown in the movie. Of course, they are both kids, and as such, they are not too spectacular of actors, but for their age and the role they play, they are actually quite good. This is the main reason that this movie is good - the relationship between these two brothers. Without that the movie would have failed miserably.I also thoroughly enjoyed the special effects, which were very spectacular. Several times I was actually afraid that the kids would not make it through the adventure in one piece. The aliens in the movie were very well done, too - very creepy but not too creepy for the young ones who might want to go see this movie.Now for some faults in the movie. Several times it seemed like their lines or the situations they were in bordered on cheesiness. However, considering the material they are dealing they manage to avoid most cheese quite well. I also thought the movie dragged on a bit too much sometimes - I wanted to yell at them, ""Play the game!!"" so they could just finish the game and be out of the dangerous situation. But they had ten to fifteen minute intervals where it was just expounding on the dangerousness of their situation or a refusal by one of the kids (mainly the younger one) to continue playing.All in all Zathura is a great family flick, and though it may seem a little immature for adults at times, on the whole it can be a very satisfying (and thrilling) experience.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
108,thomasmitilis1995,"I'M NOT MEAN DANNY. I'M IN FOURTH GRADE, I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND...",5,13 May 2020,"PROS:
~The film underlines a message about appreciating your siblings, no matter how they get on your nerves. Even if you have a argument with them, you will turn to them for your problems in the end. Furthermore, the movie is very realistic of how can a older sibling can be careless or how the younger one can be annoying. Josh Hutcherson and Jonah Bobo give strong performances as the two brothers.
~The visual effects hold up well even for today standards and the use of practical effects is a wise choice. One of the most memorable moments is when the children realize they are in outer space. The images in this case are macigally beautiful and the vastness of space is intimidating. Also, the design of Zorgons and the robot is decent enough.
~The utilization of the house as a spaceship is a creative way for a fantastic adventure. Besides this, the design of the board game is brilliant.CONS:
~The argument between the brothers feels repetitive in the second act. There is a moment where the two children scream at each other for a couple of minutes, something that is very irritating.
~Kristen Stewart's character is bland. She spends half the movie being asleep or frozen. Dealing with the relationship between the siblings for the most part, it would be better if she was included more in the main storyline. Moreover, what is the purpose of creating a awkward moment between her and Shepard's character considering that he is eventually her brother?
~The film abandons its storyline on the altar of giving us a message. As a result the plot is too straightforward and the paradox that is created with Dax Shephard's character makes no sense.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
109,eXtreme23,Great thrill ride of an adventure,7,2 April 2006,"Based on the best-selling book by the acclaimed children's writer Chris Van Allsburg (""The Polar Express,"" ""Jumanji""), Zathura is a heart-racing sci-fi adventure about two bickering brothers who are propelled into deepest, darkest space while playing a mysterious game they discovered in the basement of their old house. Zathura is the long awaited sequel of ""Jumanji"". One of my favorite movies of all time. I remember when there was an announcement that there will be a JUMANJI 2, years and years passed by and then I saw the trailer for this movie. There was quite a comparison between these two movies, but I knew that Jumanji will be better. I'm not really going to compare this to Jumanji, because this is a whole new adventure.Zathura is a great thrill ride of an adventure and it has plenty of surprises. There aren't really any parts to bore you, this is a fun movie. But there is a question that I want to know. Who exactly made the game of Zathura? The two young boys found it in their basement, but we don't quite know who made it, or where it exactly came from and how did it even get in the basement in the first place. Thats not really going to bother me because overall I enjoyed this film. 7.5/10",Zathura - A Space Adventure
110,neiljones1981,Quite Enjoyable,8,8 July 2018,"Caught the film entirely by accident on TV one day and discovered it to be a good fun adventurous yarn similar in style to Jumanji.Effectively described as Jumanji in space, the basic premise is an all powerful all knowing board game that one has to play to the end in order to undo everything it does damage wise. In Zathura the game is discovered in the basement with no back story as to how it ended up there, whereas Jumanji had a back story and suggested its chain of events had been going on for well over a hundred years. However the books suggest Zathura was found in a park and it carries on from Jumanji, though the film presents this as an entirely standalone story.The two lead boys, here a young Josh Hutcherson and Jonah Bobo, carry the film between them easily, naturally and effortlessly. Character wise, Hutcherson and Bobo appear to both bond and wind each other up as brothers do but this relationship and their bickering and arguing becomes a key focal point later in the movie.Effects wise, much of it works pretty well, though your suspension of disbelief will get shattered if you think too hard about what's going on in the plausibility stakes, especially once the kids open the front door while they're in space, but it's fair to say there is probably more to the powers of Zathura than is let on - possibly a forcefield of some sort that allows them to breathe and for gravity to apply? Wouldn't be unusual in the context of the film, after all Zathura can't be played to completion if its players can't breathe!Is it better than Jumanji? In some ways, yes. In others, no. Jumanji was financially successful at the box office (and later rebooted) but received crap reviews, whereas Zathura flopped at the box office but received better reviews and will probably not get rebooted.In summary, I liked this. More than I was probably expecting if truth be told. Very watchable, stands up to repeat viewing and has a genuinely likeable cast to tell its story. Very well recommended.",Zathura - A Space Adventure

Director Favreau (severly underrated) brings Van Allsburg's tale to the big screen with help from David Koepp penning a generally solid but routine script. The problem with Zathura is that we have seen this story a million times from different movies and the characters movements is rather restricted to a crumbling house, and not beyond to what seems like an entire universe.

113,k844140,A possible way to spend an evening,7,3 August 2021,"Yes, this movie is not a masterpiece, but wake up, it's a family film for the little ones to enjoy. Of course adults wouldn't be bored if they are not too stuffy, but don't expect Zathura to be one of the best films of 2005. It is a light adventure which tells about how it's important to love your family and your siblings in particular. It's not slow or boring, has some interesting moments and surprises. Nobody does a magnificent performance, but Dax Shepard, Tim Robbins and Kristen Stewart look fine. The two leading kids (especially Jonah Bobo) are obviously unexperienced and don't play good enough, but it doesn't ruin the film. Zorgons look fine, and for its budget Zathura looks quite decent. Nevertheless, apart from two kids' acting there are some flaws. First of all, these kids yell and brawl quite frequently. Also Kristen Stewart's character looks odd in this story. It is a stereotypical high-school sister who thinks only about boys and dates, and she does nothing significant. You could drop her out of this story and hardly anything would change. But still Zathura is quite all right for parents to watch with their children. If you want to entertain your children or you like this kind of movies, you can spend your evening watching it.",Zathura - A Space Adventure

115,Maedhros35,Certainly not as good as Jumanji,5,12 June 2007,"I started watching this movie with the high hopes of this being a Jumanji follow-up with some great space adventure add-ons, but I ended up being a bit disappointed.In fact the movie is not half as much about a space adventure as it is about family and family relations - mainly about the two kid brothers who can't stand each other. Now that might make for a nice background for the story, but in order to make a nice space adventure movie that picture should be painted in the first fifteen minutes at maximum; at which moment it is time for the big bonding moment and the movie can get started.Not in this movie, oh no! The kids scream at each other and yell simultaneously for the first 75 minutes, and that for a movie with approx. 90 minutes running time. In the mean time the usual amount of wanton destruction happens, but we knew that from Jumanji.To sum up, the story could have been better, the special effects could have been better, the lead roles could have been better - Nay, it is certainly not as good as Jumanji.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
116,GrimmBrother,A fun trip through space thanks to a board game,6,24 December 2006,"If you're interested in films about magical board games, flying houses, sibling rivalry, mysterious astronauts and ugly Aliens, then Zathura will interest you.I'm sure you remember that movie many years ago called ""Jumanji"". It starred Robin Williams and was about a magical board game called Jumanji that brought the jungle into the home of this family.Zathura is quite similar to Jumanji, seeing as it was written by Jumanji's writer. It started off as a Jumanji sequel but soon it began to take on a life of its own.The adventure in this board game takes place in space. It starts off with two brothers aged 10 and 6, who are continually at each other's throats and competing with each other for their father's attention. They alternate between their mother's home and their father's ever since their divorce.They have a sister named Lisa who is your typical teenage girl, going out with boys and worrying about her appearance, although she is more of what Avril Lavigne used to be like than what Hilary Duff is now.However, one day when their father is out, one of the boys finds a mysterious board game called Zathura in the basement of his father's house. He takes it up to his brother and begs him to play it. While playing, a meteor shower hits their house and their house somehow lands up in space. The two brothers embark on a dangerous space adventure one turn at a time, meeting various obstacles along the way including a defective murderous robot, despicably ugly aliens called Zorgons, the sun, a mysterious astronaut and a search for a vitally important object gone missing.Despite its rather predictive conclusion, Zathura is quite an enjoyable film. You may find yourself questioning the fact that when in space a human cannot breathe as well as when in space, you should be floating and not flat on the ground.What makes it even more bizarre is that water and electrical appliances work. After all it is just a movie and I'd say it should be classified as a fantasy and in a fantasy anything can happen.The Zorgons might frighten children under ten but otherwise the whole family will enjoy.",Zathura - A Space Adventure

The kids are realistic, and there are effectively no adults guiding or lecturing them. (OK, possibly one young adult; you'll have to see the movie to get it.) A nice evening home with the kids, or just a trip back to childhood. Special mention to Dax Shepard, whose performance as The Astronaut is delicately nuanced between competent and capable, and sensitive and approachable.

118,baconballs1969,Interesting And Good Entertainment.,7,5 August 2006,"I saw this movie a few nights ago and thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish.The movie is aimed at a young audience, but as an adult there was plenty of detail and content to keep me watching through to the end and I am very pleased that I did.There is also a lovely little ""twist"" towards the end which would bring a tear to the eye of many a person - young or old.I thought the cinematography was excellent, as were the special effects. It's just like Jumanji, but this time set in outer space and without the annoying, rubber-faced Robin Williams.** SPOILER ** One thing did bug me though. When the kids and the astronaut hurled the burning sofa out into space to deter the attack from those lizard aliens, where did the flames get the oxygen from in outer space to keep the sofa burning? << END OF SPOILER >>However, this is just a minor quibble that I have in what is mostly a very entertaining film - one which both kids and adults should equally enjoy.I highly recommend it.

119,astro_92,One very awesome motion picture!,10,20 November 2005,"I went to go see this movie the other day, and I must say that I was blown away. Zathura is an incredible fantasy film for families everywhere. This picture has vast intensity! There are also a lot of heartfelt moments here as well. Zathura is absolutely guaranteed to captivate anyone who views it.From the way that I look at this movie, Zathura is a cross between Jumanji and Explorers. The story contained here follows the elements of a fictional vintage board game and the realm of outer space. Two prepubescent brothers, Walter and Danny, are consistently having arguments about anything and everything. They have an older sister named Lisa, who is very sweet but also lazy. Their parents are split apart in the story. The Zathura board game is discovered by Danny (the youngest child) while he is down in the basement of the house in which they are staying. He starts off the game and he and Walter are soon forced to finish it up so that they can return to Earth again where they will be safe. While playing the vintage game, all three children encounter a wide variety of surprises that come as a result of the words that are printed on the game's cards. In the end, they make it back to their rightful place on Earth and their lives are changed forever.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
120,elfflame,A fun follow-up to a great film,7,23 June 2007,"I avoided this in the theatre because I was sure it wold be bad in comparison to Jumanji, but I was quite pleasantly surprised. If you liked Jumanji, I highly recommend it.-- spoilers past here -- Absolutely favorite part? The very first turn, the younger brother gets ""Meteor Shower,"" and the two boys are sitting in the living room at the time, watching TV. Once the meteor shower seems to end, the boys come out from their hiding place, then a huge meteor comes and smashes the TV to smithereens. Love it.The boys' relationship to each other is the centre of the movie, and it does an excellent job of exploring it. The sister seems rather unnecessary in the story, really, and is mostly there for a one-shot joke that seems a bit off for a Family movie.I definitely think it's fun for a watch if you liked Jumanji and if you're a fan of soft sci-fi.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
121,Travis_Moran,"Not original, but still nice!",7,22 April 2006,"by Travis & Annette...Well, we finally agreed on the rating for a movie...woo hoo!. We both give this one a 7.Most everyone will agree that this movie is almost an exact clone of Jumanji, except for the setting. This doesn't make it bad though.ANNETTE: Actually I enjoyed this movie just a small bit more than Jumanji. The kids were better actors is the main reason. My favourite character had to be Danny. He was so cute and played his role admirably...a very believable 6-year-old boy.TRAVIS: Walter was my favourite. I've known some 10yo kids who acted almost exactly like that. Walter was a very realistic character. But both boys were actually quite good. Generally I have issues with kid actors, but these are an exception. The other actors (other than the Astronaut) were relatively minor. And I really didn't care much for the Astronaut although his acting was fine.ANNETTE: The dialogue between the boys is much improved over Jumanji. It's very typical of what arguing young boys would say to each other. For instance, Walter bragging about his having a robot and Danny being jealous of that fact. And I thought Walter's ending line to the effect of ""so you like my eyes..."" when his sister is leaving was perfect.TRAVIS: Strangely this movie reminded me of titles like ""Romeo & Juliet"" with DiCapprio or maybe ""Titus"" where it's the same story but set in a different era. In this case of course it's Jumanji set in space. One cute thing that amused me was the deal with the bike. It's in almost every scene...orbiting the house, bumped by the Zorgon ship, and then at the end falling just where Walter was standing.We both agree effects were mediocre to weak. But that didn't seem to detract from the movie. If you are an effects person it might be an issue.And we feel this movie is pretty much suitable for anyone to watch. Maybe parents with wee ones should note the very mild language. The words ""biatch"" & ""you suck"" are used. Otherwise it's clean.This is a pleasant little family movie with a decent story most kids can relate to.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
122,predator_silver77,Space style in the sense of Jumanji adventure,6,16 December 2008,"The Plot: In this heart-racing science fiction adventure, ZATHURA, two squabbling brothers are propelled into deepest, darkest space while playing a mysterious game discovered in the basement of their old house, On their fantastic journey, they are joined by a stranded astronaut and must survive meteor showers, hostile lizard-like aliens, a rocket-propelled robot who runs amok and an intergalactic spaceship battle. Unless the finish the game and reach the planet Zathura, they could be trapped in outer space forever.My Spiel: I have to say I actually enjoyed this movie, going into I was expecting much. Just thought it would be a rip off of Jumanji but set in space (which it very well is Jumanji 2: in space). But this movie had elements that weren't in the Jumanji movie. I enjoyed the nice visual takes on the Zathura adventures. I have to say the bickering between the brothers was funny. I guess because I have a older brother and I can relate. The comedy in this movie sets the mood and raises the level of the movie, something enjoyable for the whole family to enjoy this movie.End Result: From the creator of Iron Man.

If it tickles you to watch really annoying brats in odd situations then this is a dream movie for you. As I watched the movie on CD I was so uncomfortable that I figured it must have bombed like crazy in the theaters, and that based on how much it must have cost to make I also figured the director never got a big budget movie to screw with again. I was right about the bomb! I was right about the budget! And...the director goes on to make mega budget, mega successful Iron Man. Only in Hollywood. What ever success there is in the future for director Favreau, this frustratingly annoying, whiny, nonsensical mess is an unfortunate stain on his resume.",Zathura - A Space Adventure

126,Notraxxs,"If you saw Jumanji, you saw the better version.",4,13 November 2005,"Whoever wrote this thing really did a disservice to kids. Do they act in this sort of illogical and ludicrous fashion? Granted this movie puts these children in a ludicrous situation, but their actions and their dialogue never had me, not even for a second. With meteorites falling, a house flying through space, and monsters attacking, are children going to launch into dialogue about respect and love? And this is my major beef with this movie. It had a pretty cool concept going, but the dialogue rings hollow and there just isn't enough substance between these two kids to carry it. The writers don't give the Zach Braff lookalike anything to work with and everyone else is throwaway. 4/10 for cool CGI and a little twist at the end.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
127,WadeVC-1,Fantastic space adventure for all ages.,7,12 October 2008,"Zathura is a great space adventure movie that can be enjoyed by those of all ages, and is equally impressive in its FX, acting and storyline.The story of two siblings that are constantly fighting and trying to out-do each other as brothers will, find themselves and their house adrift in space after they engage in a old game found in the basement of their fathers house. The game (called Zathura), is a space adventure game that, as each player takes their turn, comes to life.What ensues is a great science fiction/fantasy movie that will keep you engaged and enthralled as the two brothers now come to rely upon one another to finish the game and return to earth.Excellent cast, acting and storytelling.

128,dianawannabe1129,A great family flick,9,15 November 2005,"I saw this movie on Sunday. I thought it was so much better than Jumanji. Jumanji was cool, but this was way cooler. I'm almost 16, and I have a younger sister, but she would be scared to death. Josh Hutcherson and Jonah Bobo make great leads as Walter and Danny. Kristen Stewart handles the role of Lisa well. They did change some things out of the book (for example, the character of Lisa wasn't in the book, but she was in the movie), but that's okay. The movie was still awesome. I give this movie a nine out of ten, for the great acting, great special effects, and happy ending, but it was a tad predictable. There were a few surprises, but you could predict what was going to happen from those surprises. Take a kid 10 or older to Zathura, and enjoy the ride!",Zathura - A Space Adventure
129,FlickMan,"Marvelous production, weak story line",6,12 July 2006,"I enjoyed ""Zathura"" despite its many flaws. The production is first-rate, and the retro look of the board game and the things it generates (robot, monsters, space ships) is wonderful. I especially enjoyed the robot - a malevolent Robbie on steroids - and the scimitar-wielding Zorgons. Unfortunately, the story line is thin, verging on nonsensical. The kids are exposed to various perils AND GIVEN NO WAY TO COMBAT THEM. Occasionally, they are given a ""way out"" but fail to take it. The kids' acting is adequate, but no more. The teenage sister seems to be in the movie only to look cute. And the ""message"" -- brothers should stick together -- is pretty simpleminded. Still, ""Zathura"" is reasonably entertaining. After a slow start it moves right along, and it offers kid-friendly adventure without being mind-numbingly dull for parents.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
130,TashC,Get into Outer Space without leaving the house.,7,19 June 2006,"Things can get quite tough at home when your parents have just divorced, your older sister doesn't know you exist and your older brother wishes you didn't. But no matter how bad it gets, Zathura confirms that things are much, much worse in outer space.Left alone on a Saturday afternoon, two highly competitive brothers ricochet towards trouble when the younger one, Danny, is tormented into the basement and unearths an old space adventure game called Zathura. By the time Danny realizes that they ""shouldn't play that game"", a meteor shower has decimated the living room and the house is uprooted and floating above the rings of Saturn. Though with every turn they take bad things happen, there is no going back and the boys must play on.Zathura is unashamedly nostalgic  the game is reminiscent of 1950's comics and faded tin toys, Dad's house is from a similar era, with a dumb waiter just waiting to lower a small boy into danger, and even the story is comfortably familiar. By the same author as Jumanji, where the game took us into the perilous jungle, now Zathura transports us off this planet. And though this is science fiction, whether it is the skittling, malfunctioning robot, the floating astronaut or the circling Zorgon battleships, it still all seems vintage.But most impressively, the way this movie was made is old school. There is some CGI to create the vastness of the galaxy, but otherwise all the explosions, monster lizards, robots and even the frozen sister are there for real.And in the midst of the unceasing explosions and imminent ingestion by carnivorous inter-galactic lizard pirates, Zathura has some important messages - about family responsibility, how to be a good brother, wishing on a star and the error of making decisions when angry.Parents may find the constant bickering between the boys a bit nerve-wracking and the stress of Dad juggling work and his sons' rivaling demands for his attention uncomfortably realistic. Not to mention the horror of watching a home being systematically obliterated. But we are sure the kids will love it.DVD Extras: It was so much fun watching the house being destroyed and now you can see how they built it, rocked it and ripped through it. From the meteors, to the Zorgon missiles and the jettisoned couch, all those flames are real. Stacks of extras that cover the making of just about everything in the movie.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
131,roythedog,The most cliche and predictable movie I have ever seen.,3,10 September 2020,"Now I loved this movie as a kid. It came on Netflix recently so I decided to watch it again and man was I disappointed. Now I have not read the books this and the movie Jumanji are based on. However, watching this didn't feel like Jumanji, it felt like an annoying cliche predictable mess. I love Tim Robbins, he was the only tolerable character in this movie. I enjoyed seeing Tim Robbins in a less serious and more silly role and some of the scenes with him reminded me of trying to get my own dad to do stuff with me while he was working. However, the two main characters are insufferable. Literally more then half the movie is just them arguing and a good chunk of their arguing is nothing more then filler. I will admit I found myself laughing at all the scenes of frozen Krysten Stewart. Although she was more comic relief when she was frozen, after she gets unfrozen, she is just annoying. The astronaut is pretty unlike able at many points especially as he rudely eats all the food, but I did enjoy his attempts to try to help and keep the 2 main characters from arguing as much. However, the biggest problem is how predictable and cliche this movie is. You already know what's going to happen in most of the scenes even if you haven't seen Jumanji and so it kills any opportunity for suspense. Jumanji was good because it wasn't meant to be that child friendly or even that suspenseful and scary. It was supposed to be a fantastical tale about a board game coming to life. Robin Williams gave one of his greatest performances ever both at his most stillest and serious. Zathura doesn't have a good anchor character like that who carries the film and is there to advance the plot with explanations of what's going to happen. The astronaut is supposed to do that but he appears too late in the movie to have any character development beyond eating all the food and trying to help fend off aliens. This movie is nothing more than a standard predictable kids ripoff flick. It's meant for kids and uses the admittedly very good special effects. As an adult though this movie just ends up annoying especially after you have to sit through all the filler of the 2 main boys screaming at each other.",Zathura - A Space Adventure

Based on the children's book ""Zathura"" written by Chris Van Allsberg, the same author as the children's book ""Jumanji"", this movie has the same premise as the movie ""Jumanji"" in which children begin playing a board game, where the actions called upon by the game occur in real life. The main difference is that in this movie the game lands the children in outer space. This movie additionally focuses strongly on the theme of sibling rivalries and brotherhood. A simple movie, but fun nonetheless.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
134,Ithorianjedimaster2,Zathura: Jumanji In Space (A Good Thing),7,5 October 2009,"I wonder how many people remember the movie ""Jumanji"" as a good movie. I wonder how many remember the scores of animals rampaging through the streets. I wonder how many people remember the movie just because Robin Williams was in it. Probably the last one. You see, ""Jumanji"" introduced the idea of a 'cursed' board game that when you play it, you become an actual part of the game. Unfortunately, that is all the movie had going for it...and Robin Williams.This generation's ""Jumanji"" takes the stage as ""Zathura"", which is basically Jumanji in space, but has much better production value. The movie centers around two brothers, Danny (Jonah Bobo) and Walter (Josh Hutcherson), who are obviously at odds. Danny wants nothing more than to hang out with his father (Tim Robbins) and his big brother while Walter wishes Danny never existed. Well, this brotherly separation is tested when suddenly, Danny finds a board game called Zathura. You can probably guess the rest. He starts to play it and in an instant, their house is in space. ""Zathura"" can be given plenty of credit because it has much more character and imagination behind it. It is a neat little piece that Danny can't read and so has to rely on Walter to read the cards that foretell doom or salvation.However, there are a few plot points taken from Jumanji that can easily be pointed out, but it's not like deja vu. In both movies, there is the summoning of a trapped previous player who helps the heroes get to their goal, Jumanji had Alan, the jungle man, and Zathura has Dax Shepard playing the role of a stranded astronaut. Also, in both movies, cheating is heavily punished, but Zathura doesn't go as obscene as making a kid into a monkey. It literally ejects Walter from the house! And then how Zathura sucks all the game's dangers back as a black hole like in Jumanji, though it looks a lot more awesome in Zathura.The hazards in Zathura are also much more life-threatening. Jumanji had its animal stampedes and harassing monkeys, but during the long haul, they didn't really threaten the lives of the characters after they are summoned. A lion for example attacks the characters, but is locked in the bedroom where it stays for the rest of the movie. Zathura's dangers are very extreme and eye-pleasing. While the idea of evil aliens and robots is nothing new, at least they are continuous threats. The flesh-eating Zorgons, who are attracted to light, return later in the film after Kristen Stewart's character ignites the furnace pilot light after Walter has previously lowered its flame and how the robot is always that silent danger that you know is there but is taking its time to strike.The movie isn't without its flaws. Kristen Stewart's character, Lisa, feels unneeded. Hell, she spends most of the movie in cyrogenic sleep! And when she isn't, she just stands in the background, wide-eyed and screaming. The character of Danny is just awful. He's the movie's flat tire, which is a shame since he is one of the protagonists. Danny is constantly chickening out during the game, refusing to play on several occasions, despite the fact that completing the game will end the nightmarish events. Jonah Bobo may be young, but he just doesn't make Danny likable. His horrified little face is permanently plastered in every scene.The script can also be to blame since it doesn't really do Danny any favors. Danny's constant shouting the obvious like ""Meteors!"" and ""Zorgons!"", as well as his ridiculous requoting of ""Zorgons eat meat! We're meat!"" will make your groan. The only actors who can be given props for their performances are Josh Hutcherson and Dax Shepard. Josh, who has appeared in several movies following Zathura, is very believable for his age and even when he is being a jerk, you still like him. Dax Shepard, another developing actor, is easily the best in the film.Still, it is fun to point out references to other scifi movies. When Lisa, Walter's sister, becomes infatuated with the astronaut, only to realize he is actually an adult Walter is a funny nod to Star Wars, with their whole ""Luke and Leia"" situation and Star Trek references are abound, especially the reptilian Zorgons, which were clearly inspired by Star Trek's multitude of alien species.Though Jumanji had its plot issues, Zathura does too. The movie's climax and falling action has some pretty strange writing. Like how Danny is able to sneak into the Zorgon ship, grab the game, sneak out through a herd of four-eyed goats (I'm not kidding), and escape without so much of a scratch. It makes the evil, terrifying Zorgons look like a bunch of chums. Then how the best card in the game, the gold card, allows Walter to make a wish through a shooting star. Of course, this can be let go on account of the movie IS for kids rather than criticizing guys like me.All in all, Zathura is a very good movie. Few movies are flawless and it's not like Zathura's iffy script will completely ruin the experience. If you want to watch this film, sit down with your kids, pop some popcorn and enjoy an adventure that is literally out of this world.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
135,MitchellXL5,Waste of Time,1,27 November 2005,"It was a weak book to begin with and the screenplay does little to add anything to it - it smelled like the first book Chris Van Allsburg wrote specifically to be turned into a movie. I prefer the cartoon series of Jumanji to this.As for the family values, the film is really about the bonding of males rather than the bonding of family - the parents are divorced and the mother goes unseen and the sister is a waste of space, mostly there to be bitchy and self-centered (even at the end, she hasn't changed - is she a stand-in for the mother? Did the screenwriter get divorced recently?) and for the camera to have an unseemly preoccupation with body. Everyone I saw it with was pretty weirded out by the way the camera leered at her. It's a shame, because Elf was a good movie, but Van Allsburg's quiet books don't seem to translate to the screen very well.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
136,lonicelee,For kids only,2,12 October 2008,"Unlike Jumanji, this is NOT for anyone smarter than a 5th grader. They use typical kid shortcomings instead of writing a clever script. Much of the story didn't make sense or was simply unbelievable. They seem to just make stuff up to fit what they wanted - some things floated in space including the sputum and the astronaut, but the kids were totally unaffected by 0 gravity. The guy stuck in the game, the Zorgons we never see, the robot repairing itself forever, all seemed like lazy writing and directing. The youngest kid screws up constantly and says I'm sorry at least 40 times. I was so sick of this needy, whiny child that I didn't care if they made it home or not. I'm sure there are parents who don't know how to discipline their kids so some will find this believable.

However, based on positive advanced word of mouth and my faith in Jon Favreau, I decided to go to a sneak preview. This was such a pleasant surprise. This avoids every mistake that was made in ""Jumanji"". The kids act like real kids. The humor grows out of the characters as does the suspense. The story is the point of this movie, not the (impressive) special effects. The acting is strong, the score is appropriately old-fashioned and every time you think you know exactly where the story is headed, something pops up to surprise you. Funny, suspenseful and just plain fun, this movie deserves to be seen in the theater. Don't think of it as a spin-off of Jumanji.

Do you want to know what it is? Oh, believe me, I'll give you the answer.The astronaut they meet in space is Walter grown up. Now, I don't know about you, but for me that's very wrong. How can someone exist as a child and as a grown man at the same time? It's impossible.Up until that part, I found it quite convenient for children. Fun, really, and the kids are quite cute.I don't suggest anyone to watch this and enjoy it. You can enjoy it, sure, but don't watch the last ten or fifteen minutes of the movie.I give it a five for the cute kids and aliens. The other five flew out the window along with my mind the last fifteen minutes of the movie--and when Lisa thought that the grown-up Walter had ""gorgeous eyes."" The Walter Thing really killed me.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
139,abahb1,Good.....but could have been much better,6,14 November 2005,"From an overall message standpoint, this film gets a 10 out of 10. I really enjoyed the the two actors who play the brothers (Jonah Bobo and Josh Hutchenson). I think in the end, the film is hurt by being too much like Jumanji (the other Chris Van Allsburg). I have never read either book, so they may be very similar, but still, no attempt to separate this film from Jumanji was made.Dax Shepard is surprisingly good as the astronaut, playing basically a straight role. Tim Robbins makes what essentially is a cameo as the dad. It would have been interesting to perhaps utilize his talent and had him more involved in the film, but again, not knowing the source material, don't know how that would have worked out.The special effects and adventure which made Jumanji fun falls totally flat here. Were it not for the great performances of the kids playing the brothers, this film would have earned a far less rating than 6 from me.A good film overall, but one that definitely is a DVD rental, if you really enjoyed it, a DVD purchase. But I would save your cinema money for other films this season.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
140,Ronald_Mexico,"Superior casting helps ""Zathura"" eclipse ""Jumanji""",9,7 March 2006,"Let's face it: ""Zathura"" is basically a carbon copy of ""Jumanji"", with the former based in space and the latter based in the jungle. Both involve children playing a seemingly innocuous board game that shockingly comes to life, with the players needing to finish the game in order to survive.With two such similar premises, how is that ""Zathura"" ended up as a completely superior film to ""Jumanji""? In my view, the reason begins and ends with the casting. Tim Robbins, kind enough to take time out from his busy politicking schedule in order to actually do some acting work, was perfectly cast as the father and added a sense of legitimacy to the film. The boys themselves were excellent young actors. Jonah Bobo as 'Danny' in particular was very impressive; it's easy to recognize his talent and emotional range as he goes from contrite younger brother to jealous sibling to frightened school kid within the span of a few frames. Josh Hutcherson's understated performance grows on you as you realize that his role is to play the sullen, long-suffering older brother.In contrast, ""Jumanji"" had the overly exuberant (synonyms for ""incredibly annoying""?) Robin Williams hamming it up yet again in one of his most unlikable roles, a cameo by Frasier Crane's wife (Bebe Neuwirth) and two nondescript kids. 'Nuff said.I could go into plot points, but the basic premise of a game that comes to life about sums it up. The difference is that the audience actually cares about the fate of the kids in ""Zathura"", whereas the average viewer is probably rooting for Robin Williams to be eaten by a wayward lion in ""Jumaji"". If you're in the video store and are trying to choose between the two films' (and if you can get past some questionable language by Jonah Bobo's character in the beginning of the film), go with ""Zathura"".",Zathura - A Space Adventure
141,simmon4-1,Outta This World!,8,18 September 2007,"I always loved Jumanji as a child and wished fervently for so many years that there would be a sequel/spin-off to it. Just when I had about given up hope, this movie comes along in a blaze of extraterrestrial glory! At first, I doubted that Zathura would be as good as Jumanji, and I even waited until it came out on DVD to see it. However, I am proud to say that my doubts were completely unfounded. While I can't exactly say that Zathura was better than Jumanji, it was certainly every bit as great as it. I loved the whole shift from jungle mayhem to galactic fury. The ""events"" that the game caused to happen where enjoyable and surprisingly unpredictable. There was even a major twist at the end that I honestly did not see coming. I love it when a movie can surprise me, and this movie certainly has its fair share of surprises! In addition to that, the characters and relationships in this movie are extremely real and you feel as though you are viewing a genuine, everyday American family. If ""board game"" movies continue to be this entertaining, then I adamantly look forward to the next installment!",Zathura - A Space Adventure

The actors are excellent, there are plot twists, and it's just good old fashioned fun as well. I was pleasantly surprised when watching this movie and at the end I wished it had been longer. Jonah Bobo and Josh Hutcherson work extremely well together as the two lead characters and with special effects that are realistic (as realistic as a fantasy film can get anyway) the end result is an excellent movie for all ages. Jumanji was good but Zathura is great and I can highly recommend it to everybody. Take your kids to see it, take your parents to see it - take everyone to see it.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
143,JimmyG100,You really don't have to be a kid to enjoy this Space Adventure,7,27 December 2006,"Zathura entertains everyone. Jon Favreau is a great director for taking what is essentially a Jumanji rip off and turning it into a film that surpasses its predecessors and then some. It never gets cheesy and doesn't rely on dumb jokes just to keep the kids laughing. No, this film is the kind of movie you can watch as a kid, and then ten years later pull it out again and still enjoy it just as much as you did the first time.It is fun, and not in a flashy eye candy and a few cheap laughs way like Fantastic Four. No, this film takes itself seriously while it gives you the wild ride you're looking for. The kid actors go great together, working off each other, bringing you back to the days when you used to fight with your brother over the littlest things. Kristen Stewart's performance is a comedic delight, and Dax Shepard goes above and beyond in his role as the rugged hero Astronaut. And to top it all off is Tim Robbins, a fine icing on this talent cake.This is a movie that just works. It's nothing epic or mind blowing, but it's not a bunch of flash with no substance either. It is exactly what a fun family movie should be, not too dumb for adults and not too complicated for kids, it's something everyone can watch and enjoy. This movie works.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
144,DrunkenMasterIV,Father And Son Bonding Movie,9,14 December 2006,"I grabbed this movie at the library, and really didn't know much about it before watching it. I remembered the movie being compared to Jumanji, and figured it might be a good film to watch with my twelve-year-old son. I would like to thank everyone responsible for making this movie for giving me one of the most enjoyable movie watching experiences I've ever had!It turns out my son is at the perfect age to watch this movie. He and I were on the edge of our seats, and he had a smile on his face the entire time. This film will hold the attention of your ""tweens"" even those with the touch of ADD that is all too common in our video game, microwave meal society. I know I'm not saying much about what happens in the movie, and that's because the movie needs to be seen to be appreciated. It is part science fiction, part morality play with just the right amount of humor and a few twists and turns. The suspense level in some of the scenes is breathtaking, and other than one relatively minor expletive early in the film (nothing my son hasn't heard,) it's very family friendly.Zathura is a DVD I'll definitely be buying. My son actually thanked me for getting this ""awesome"" DVD for us to watch. Dads (and Moms) put Zthura on your ""must see"" list.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
145,pgruendler-1,"A Half Hour ""Twilight Zone"" Episode ....",4,3 November 2005,"....would have made a better show. Even in Black and White. Scrpter David Koepp may well have been brought aboard to pad this piece, which i saw in a theater in Atlanta, GA last night - for free! (An ARMED guy hired by Sony informed us that anyone caught copying the flick would be 'escorted from the premises'.... but WHO would want to copy this?) . . . . the audience was really well mixed and received the movie warmly. I thought the movie played too hard to the ten-year-old 'cussy-boy' crowd, who seemed after wards to be a bit embarrassed by it all, as were many of the parents whose eye I caught exiting the theater while the end credits rolled. Not a soul screamed at the reptilian, rubber monster that terrorized the six-year old (precocious, as usual); some of the sight gags were not fully developed (why was the bike falling out of the sky so pertinent? We never found out whose it was!); the teen girl feature was posed for the daddies in the theater. The LANGUAGE was a problem for me and will be for Evangelical Christians on out to your huge crowd small-town moralists; ""Dick""; ""Ass""; ""God"" and ""O God...."". Which begs the question: ""Who is this movie for?"" Take another look at Joe Johnston's work to see how a director creates for a wider audience. Hids ""Jumanji"" doesn't feel padded as ""Zathura"" does. The filmmakers could have gone for the PG-13 while they were at it, for the Fox ""Malcom in the Middle"" crowd. But I think that crowd is too small; look at your TV viewing demographic.... yes, this movie just misses being family fare. I hope I am right....",Zathura - A Space Adventure
146,douglasdidier,Your Kids will like this. You? Not so much......,6,28 November 2005,"I guess it's not fair to call this a rip off, since Jumanji is a Van Alsburg book, but the similarities are so much that Zathura has that against it from the get go. The effects, substance and acting are adequate but that isn't what's wrong here. It's that the concept was already done, and this movie really doesn't add anything to it. The ending is terribly predictable if you've seen or read jumanji, and the ""twist"" is fairly obvious given Jumanji as well.Kids, seeing as though they don't care about fresh plots, will like this film. It's not slow, it's got plenty of eye candy. It's not dull, it's easy to identify with, and there isn't much complexity.Adults, well, it's not as bad as many alternatives, but you won't be enthused. There is nothing to interest you, save maybe the very beginning when we begin to establish the sibling rivalry.6/10, see Chicken Little first",Zathura - A Space Adventure
147,jodilyn,More fun than Jumanji!,8,10 April 2006,"This movie was delightful with both fun and nerve tingling action scenes. There was also plenty of humor in parts. One of the funniest is when Lisa, the sister, is frozen and slides down the stairs to land at the head of her younger brother. It was also a giggler to have her fall for the older astronaut only to have a quirky end to the adoration. Kristen Stewart as Lisa is a gorgeous young woman. Jonah Bobo and Josh Hutcherson are so realistic as brothers who are at each other's throats until each has to help the other win the game in order to go home again. This movie will keep you on the edge of your seats, make you grin and then make you feel good at the end. It also goes to show that even the youngest of brothers can be a hero and save the day!

148,RipTheJacker,Zathura is random and boring...,4,5 November 2005,"Yup... that just about describes Zathura... random... and usually boring. It starts off with two brothers who are constantly fighting, and their older sister who hates everyone and doesn't want to do anything but sleep during the day. Then things get crazy when the younger brother finds an old board game, Zathura, and starts to play it.Then random/pointless events happen in no particular order. Spin the key, press the button, grab a card, something weird happens, repeat. Everything happens then, from a meteor shower, to a giant killer robot, to a bunch of lizard people who want to eat the children... out of nowhere. It just goes on and on... throughout the entire movie I was sitting there waiting for them to finish to darn game already...So a series of random events happen, and then it's all followed by a big ""twist,"" which is also pretty lame. Then someone wins the game, everything goes back to normal, and yeah... you've just watched Zathura...",Zathura - A Space Adventure

I admit, I thought it would be pretty bad, with the bad writing, average acting, and the fact that it totally rips-off Jumanji, but it was still fun.Basically, these two young brothers who don't like each other much play this board game that shoots them off into space where they must play the game to the end while enduring the countless challenges it throws at them.It's not very dependant on CGI, either. I was pleased to see that. The Brothers Grim was almost ruined by it's depandancy on CGI, among other problems. Zathura didn't suffer this fate. It uses practical effects for the occasional monster that pops up. This made me happy.Overall, Zathura was fun. Go see it soon. I'm serious.",Zathura - A Space Adventure

151,QuintHooper,A Pleasant Surprise,6,4 November 2005,"ZATHURA was a pleasant surprise.I admit, I thought the ads looked a little cheesy, so my expectations at the screening were a little low. But I was immediately drawn in by the relationship of the two brothers.It's nice when a film doesn't place all bets on action sequences, creature affects and space battles. ZATHURA starts with a realistic glimpse of post 2000 youth culture, sibling rivalry, and family relationships. Then it throws these individuals into a fantasy/science fiction adventure.The kids were real. It's obvious that Favreau has his thumb on the pulse of today's youth. The teenage daughter was dead on this generation of young people. And the whole theater identified with the two brothers fighting like we all did as kids: the older brother tries to ignore the younger, the younger persists, eventually the younger sets the older one off and they chase each other around the kitchen in socks, slipping and wiping out into the cabinets.And the film captured the typical ""split home"" struggles. ""Dad, why are you leaving? I thought we weren't going to Mom's until tomorrow?"" ""No, this is a '3 day dad week' and a '4 day mom week.'"" ""I thought it was a '4 day dad week' and a '3 day mom week!'"" Or when one of the kids complains about the dad's house. ""I like mom's house better."" Dad quickly agrees. ""So did she and now it's hers!"" The film includes some great one-liners very relevant to today's youth culture. (Parents in the audience will be laughing at lines that go right over the heads of young kids). The dad requests for his teenage daughter to not use the term ""hooking up"" when referring to her boyfriend (a term that does often pack sexual connotations). She dismisses her father, burying her face in a pillow, ""I knew we should have never rented 'Thirteen.'"" ZATHURA won't win any awards, and it won't break any box office records. But it's a film that balances funny real life moments with some fantasy action. It's not THE INCREDIBLES, and it's not SPIDERMAN II... but it's a family film that kids and parents will actually enjoy.I'll be taking my family to see it when it comes out.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
152,RandomailProductions,Probably one of my favorite movies of all time.,10,5 July 2011,"I clicked ""Hated it"" on the reviews section, and it is way overlooked. People say its not a kids film because of some minor stuff, some people hate it because its a ""Ripoff of Jumanji"" (Even though its a sequel, smart one...) I personally love this movie, mainly because there is no other movie like it! (Except Jumanji, I already established that) but I think Zathura is a little bit better than Jumanji. Normally I wouldn't say that about a sequel, but Zathura is just more interesting. For one thing, in Jumanji they are still home, there is just a bunch of crazy things happening, but in Zathura, THEY ARE TRAPPED IN SPACE WITH A BUNCH OF ALIENS DESTROYING THEIR HOUSE. Making it more intense. But I always wondered what would happen if they were playing the game outside (Not in their house) because you see, we assume they just get shot up into space, but how would that work outside? would the ground that surrounds them just descend from the ground and take them into space? Anyways, They also meet an astronaut which *Spoiler* In the end, it turns out to be Walter (One of the main characters) but older! Which was a great twist. Reminds me of the time Darth Vader admitted that he was Luke's father. This movie is an A+ movie that I Recommend A lot. Check it out.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
153,orizano,better than Chiken Little,8,6 November 2005,"It's better than Chicken Little, which was a cute little family movie. This is by no means cute, but it a family movie, with action and comedy and it is entertaining. I wouldn't bring an average seven year-old, but kids older than that should be able to handle the more relatively intense scenes. Teens with imagination and a willingness to enjoy life should find it acceptable fair. Those I-know-everything, see-my-picture-in-the-dictionary-under-angst kids in their teens and twenties will of course see another opportunity to vent spleen, call people names and attempt to rain on other's parades (and unless something drastic happens to improve their personality, they're going to be bitter people all their lives), so ignore them. I read Zathura several years ago to my kid, and it is written by the author of Jumanji . There is a similarity of theme, but the stories are different. And if my memory is correct, at the end of the Zathura book, the brother go to bury the game, come across the Jumanji game and wisely leave it alone. So the two stories take place in the same universe, but Zathura is NOT technically a sequel to Jumanji.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
154,GundersonRocks,Yuck,5,6 November 2006,"I disliked this movie very much. Jumanji was great, and when I heard of a ""modern version"" being made, I was a little excited. This was horrible. People who like this are usually parents who think it teaches children valuable lessons about not fighting. I disagree. The two children in the film waste about thirty minutes of the movie doing nothing but yelling at each other. I got bored of that really quickly. When the boy Walter wishes for the football on the star, the whole ""intensity"" was very corny and not realistic. If you want to see a good film, go watch Jumanji. If you want to see a rip off of Jumanji, see this. If you want to see an even worse rip off of Jumanji, watch Stay Alive.My Rating: 5 out of 10 stars",Zathura - A Space Adventure

I don't understand some of the negative comments here. I guess that Some people just live to put things down. Anyway, this movie has become one of my favorites. The effects were good, and integrated well, the casting and acting was solid. The twists and turns were well thought out. The 1950's vintage toy look of the game is superb. Being a science fiction fan, the space adventure theme appealed more to me than Jumanji. If you are a special features junkie, like me, then the DVD has plenty of good extras. The making-of features discuss safety on the set which I thing is a great lesson for starting filmmakers.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
156,JustJudy,Should be PG-13,6,12 November 2005,"Zathura is a very exciting, visually stimulating, and often times entertaining movie -- but it is not for all ages. This movie, IMHO, pushes the envelope with a PG rating and is a perfect example of how cartoons, movies, and media in general are ""upping the ante"" as far as terror and excitement because kids today are much more jaded than they used to be. My suggestion for Zathura's audience would be ages 7-8 and over. My 9 year old son loved Zathura, but:My 5 1/2 year old, who is a huge Star Wars fan (we finally relented and let him watch RotS when it came out on DVD) was terrified for a few minutes of Zathura and even asked to ""go home"" when the Zorgons (sp?) were in Danny & Walter's house. (He didn't bat an eye during RotS, by the way.) There is also a frightening (and thankfully brief) scene at the beginning when the older brother puts his young sibling in a dumbwaiter and drops him into the basement in pitch darkness.There are a few instances of rough language, too: the 6-year-old calls the 10-year-old a ""di*k,"" the older sister says ""A*s,"" and the 10-year-old commands his robot, ""get me a juice box, bee-atch.""If you look past this sad family's bickering relationships (except for the last five minutes of the movie, when everyone enjoys the magical movie reconciliation) you'll find fun, edge-of-your-seat excitement, and even a few moments of brotherly love.",Zathura - A Space Adventure

The same basic concept (the magical board game) with an entirely different twist. I was excited when I saw the previews and after hearing that the movie didn't rely entirely on CG, as is the case with many films nowadays.Unfortunately, it proved to be an utter let-down. The first twenty minutes or so had potential. Yet it quickly turned into a mess of old ideas, mediocre (at best) acting, and a movie that just didn't have the feel to hold my attention. If I had to describe the entire thing in a single word, I would say it was just plain boring. Within the last half hour, which should have been the best time to grab at my attention, I just wanted to leave the theater. The only thing that kept me there was the fact I had paid money to see this and didn't want it totally wasted.

I am pleased to say, it is a lovely kids' movie, with a lot of action and some suspense. I LOVE fantasy movies and fairy tales, and this movie reminds me of just that. A modern fairy tale, with creative imagery for children, and a few good moral parts thrown in there.

162,dsilverman,Enjoyable sci-fi flick if you don't question the logic too much,6,7 November 2005,"I have to admit that I did not see Jumanji, so I am probably missing a crucial yardstick by which to measure this film since the book was written by the same author and the themes (I understand) are quite similar. However, it's an enjoyable film if you don't look too deeply beyond the lack of logic....like how they still have electricity and other utilities in outer space, why they aren't afraid of falling off the stairs into space, why they don't ask the astronaut his name, why Lisa does not freak out more when she discovers her circumstances, why the game only sees what we see so far as cheating is concerned, etc., etc. This may not make much sense to those who haven't seen the film, but not much in the film makes sense.

I feel like, however, that the quality of jumanji was better. you don't have to be clairvoyant to predict how the movie goes. Predictable and unoriginal.This movie was geared to a younger audience so it cannot be critiqued as heavily. For a kids movie it has surprisingly good special effects and acting as far as I am concerned.

Zathura is a rare film in that it's demographic isn't global in scope. I'm not sure how it would go over with young girls but I saw it with my brother and his kids (my nephew's) and we all were entertained. The special effects are not over the top and are well done.

This movie will have you laughing all the way home. Jumanji is nothing compared to this one. The only thing they have in common is they both contain a board game. I am 16 years old and went to see it, I have no younger sibling and I loved it. I would recommend this movie to everyone, of all ages.",Zathura - A Space Adventure

Started off good (first 40 minutes) then it was ""let's throw anything in just to spin it out."" So glad I borrowed the DVD and didn't waste my money! The kids were annoying, the setting became monotonous, the plot was transparent, the effects were good but the tension (if you can call it that) was handled terribly. In all honesty, the only thing that really interested me (and I'm being serious here) was the design of the game. I paid more attention to the workings of the chain drive that pulled the little rockets around than I did to what was taking place elsewhere. Towards the end, I remembered thinking ""I don't care any more what happens to any of them, just get to the end of the film!"" Miss it if you can!

171,mvincent-12339,Absolutely dreadful,1,22 August 2020,"Where to begin?
The acting is atrocious, the characters are unlovable and not at all relatable. The ""message"" of brotherly love is facile and weakly portrayed. The ""twists"" are either nonsensical or blatantly obvious. There is nothing to enjoy about this film. Even my 8 year old son thought it was puerile, (OK not his exact word).
Some of the effects were OK, but seriously, there was nothing enjoyable about this watered down rip-off of Jumanji.
As previously mentioned, there has to be an element of reality in a film and this fails in so many ways:
A house as a space craft? no walls and still able to breath? Astronaut that was floating around in a spacesuit for 15 years, and then flies to the rescue without his space suit? These are not the only (or worst examples)",Zathura - A Space Adventure

What I got was two foul mouthed kids and the feeling that someone was trying to provide a cheap therapy session for adults whose parents divorced when they were children. I think divorce is terrible and certainly at an alarming rate in this country, but this movie is not marketed as that and the subject matter seemed to come way out of left field.I deduced that this must be the intention of the production staff because the children in attendance at my showing didn't laugh or seem to enjoy the film at all.

It's for KIDS. i never watched the show as a critical adult trying to find flaws in it or worrying about suspension-of-belief. i watched it as i used to when i was a kid, going to a Saturday afternoon matinée. Excited, thrilled at being in the theater... popcorn and pop in hand. Fidgeting in the seat until the lights dimmed. Then the anticipation... ready to enter into the story. i wasn't disappointed. The movie captured my imagination from start to finish. My advice; this is for kids only. If you're a grown-up, leave your adulthood at the door. If you enter into it as a kid you'll experience the wonder, the suspense, the thrills, the chills. This movie will stay with me forever.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
176,kaystro,Good (but SCARY) film for the whole family,7,2 November 2005,"My daughter and I saw the sneak, and we both loved it. The story was very true to the Chris Van Allsberg book on which it is based (a sequel to his earlier book, Jumanji). Best of all, we liked the realistic bickering, teasing, and cold shoulder treatment between the siblings in the story. It may have been magnified a bit for the screen, but the sibling rivalries really rang true. A lot of kids will see themselves and friends in the petty jealousies and sibling torments that are pictured here, and when the whole story is done, they will see a conclusion that has a gentle moral. There were several young children in the screening audience, and I noticed that they were nervous, clingy, and questioning in a few scary scenes. Nevertheless, the film is generally palatable, even for the young. I would target the film for kids age seven and up. The elementary age and middle school age kids will get the most out of the message of the film, but even younger kids of five and six will enjoy the movie (although they may need a parent's shoulder to hold on to in a couple of places.)",Zathura - A Space Adventure
177,mvickors,Amazing movie!,10,14 January 2012,"I can honestly say that this is my favourite movie of all time. The characters of Danny (Jonah Bobo) and Walter (Josh Hutcherson) are cast really well and are both very good young actors. It is funny right from the first minute and has some cute and heartwarming moments between the brothers. The storyline is very creative and different, and it is better than any other space film I have ever watched. The special effects are really good and the twist that comes about halfway through the movie is unexpected. The story of the two brothers is very believable and you can to relate to it, and the character of the older sister Lisa ( Kirsten Stewart) is a good edition to the story. It has you on the edge of your seat the entire time, and the various adventures the boys have bring comedy and excitement. Although this movie is mainly aimed at children, I believe that people of all ages will enjoy its thrill and originality. I have watched zathura so many times that I have lost count, and I think that the boys are much better actors than a lot of adults I have watched, especially Jonah bobo as he was so young. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone that likes good entertainment!",Zathura - A Space Adventure
178,peroinc5,The movie seemed to be a bit violent for a PG film,3,29 December 2005,"I did not feel that the movie was suitable for young children. It was disturbing to me the amount of violence and destruction that took place in Zathura. Usually with a PG movie the plot is pretty easy to figure out and understand it. I really don't believe that there was one in this film. I don't believe that the young children in the theater had any idea of what was happening in the movie. I think it would be better to tone down the violence so that the children might actually remember something like the importance of getting along with siblings, instead of a burning house flying through outer space. The older characters should have played more of a part in this movie to add balance to it. I felt as though one of the character's in the story actually took away from the theme of Zathura because the person really didn't fit into the storyline.",Zathura - A Space Adventure

The premise of two kids siblings fighting is not new, but at least make one of them sympathetic. The younger kid is a disaster at all levels. That character was not made for the actor who plays it. 
The astronaut is overplayed, and lacks charm or chemistry with any of the other players.

I'm not going to compare it to Jumanji, it's already a known fact that it's similar, even the previews used the reference. Both books, Jumanji and Zathura were written by the same person, Chris Van Allsburg. So, as a Mom of kids, and a sibling myself, it's great to see kids portrayed on film that act like real kids. It's exciting, well acted, and well made. With only five actors in the entire film, Director Favreau keeps the plot moving and the characters growing. The visuals are fun, and the game twists keep you on your toes. It may be scary for younger kids, I recommend parents view it before showing to children under 8. Nothing wrong with a little imagination and fun, and since there are so few family films out there to watch, in my honest opinion, this would be a good one to watch together.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
181,tippy-9,Zathura lives up to the hype.,10,8 November 2005,"I had read and heard a lot of good things about this film. I was confused by the comparisons to Jumanji and then the commercials boasting it as ""original."" How can a sequel be original? Isn't the definition of a sequel, in fact, a story that is a continuation of an earlier chapter?In the case of Zathura, the term ""original"" applies. Zathura is not a sequel at all. It does however share a common type of plot motivation. Here, like Jumanji, the game is the thing from which all emanates. They both have a spooky mis en scene. They both offer lessons of life. Zathura just does it a bit better than the first.The kids are great, though they do tend to get a bit too real at times for a family movie. I liked the sister quite a bit. The music is also very inspired. I was surprised to see that it was not Williams. I was sure it had been.All in all the film was quite good. I don't know that I would put it in the same league as ET, but it's certainly better than anything I've seen for families in a long time. I predict a sleeper hit.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
182,Bixie23,Warning to parents of young kids,8,19 February 2006,"Some posters have written about the worry that young kids might be scared, which is a distinct possibility. My daughter is eight years old and definitely needed some next-to-mom-on-the-couch time during the movie. More disturbing to me, however, was a four-letter word uttered by the six-year-old in the first scene. The movie does have a PG for a couple reasons, one of which being some language. I was not prepared for the language to come from one of the kids, however. The older brother also uses a version of a demeaning word later, which I do not find acceptable (although it seems to get more and more use lately). In the movie's defence, Tim Robbins' character scolds the younger brother for his use of the word, particularly because he used it towards his brother, which gives parents a quick teachable moment. All together, though, an enjoyable movie which I believe most kids will really get into, and most parents won't mind watching with them.",Zathura - A Space Adventure

There was no fun or excitement, just kids running around screaming and things being blown up. Big Whoop! This was a very boring movie. It wasn't even cute. The gags were just that, obvious gags. In the movie description, ""...as the siblings find themselves learning to cooperate in ways they never expected as they realize what they mean to each other."" should have warned me. The thing about the astronaut's brother was very cliché and pat. I'm sticking to Jumanji. Perhaps it was Robin Williams that made the movie and nothing else.

185,vravina,I liked it,6,13 November 2005,"Zathura is about two boys who are brothers and do not get along. The younger of the two finds a game and presses the button on it. Then there's a meteor shower and from there on it, the house is slowly destroyed over the course of a few hours. Also, there's a sister who gets frozen in a cryonic chamber near the beginning and an astronaut who helps the kids, kinda like Robin Williams' character, but not as important or interesting.This movie was entertaining, funny (sometimes) and mildly exciting. I think it's on a par with Jumanji, except Jumanji had more of an emotional core, while this film is mostly about noises and special effects and AWESOME.So, yeah. Mostly OK. It's no Fight Club or Eternal Sunshine or Pulp Fiction or Donnie Darko or Matrix, but it's reasonably good.However, why would they get Frank Oz to do the voice of the robot?

186,Beatleboy-3,Funny and Entertaining for the Whole Family,7,25 November 2005,"Let's get the bad out of the way...Perhaps it may be the fault of the theater or projectionist, but for the entire first reel, I was distracted because I was able to see the boom microphones at the top of the image. Just about every scene was done this way. I lost count of the number of times it happened. It could be that the projector was not set properly. The image did bleed both above and below the screen. I didn't really miss too much in reel one. Fortunately the meat of the film began with reel two. Another minor fault was with continuity. In one scene, the younger brother hurts his elbow and it is bleeding. The next scene shows two bandages there. A few minutes later, there were no bandages. He was back to a bloody elbow.And now on to the good stuff...Once I got past reel one, I was able to concentrate on the story itself. There are a number of twists and turns throughout the film. Every turn on the Zathura game, brought another adventure for the two brothers. Throughout the film they had to learn how to work together as a team. The brothers get a little help from an astronaut (arriving as part of the game). They had an older sister, but her character was pretty useless to the story except for being used as another game gag.All in all, the film is well worth seeing for the whole family. I tend to be a clock watcher during films and I must say that I did not once look at my watch. There is enough action and humor written into the script to keep anyone entertained throughout the film.",Zathura - A Space Adventure

So no surprise that I kept on watching at my watch to see what the time was, hoping that the movie would soon end. To me, it's more of a 'kid movie'; perhaps kids would love it best. For instance, my sister (who's still in her teenage years) said that she enjoyed this movie very much, because she loved to see the continuous arguments between the two brothers which were sometimes hilarious and jokey. She loved the role played by these two kids, and said that they really did a good job in making the story to look more alive. But, for me, only a 3-out-of-10 stars.

189,mlee-29,2000's version of Saturday Matinée fare,6,30 November 2005,"OK, let's can the comparisons to Jumanji. You've all read about that in other reviews. Having said that, the movie can be summed up as a modern version of those Saturday afternoon matinees in years gone by. It's a popcorn movie that would have been made by Disney in the 1960's with Fred MacMurray as the dad and Don Knott's as the astronaut.Set your expectations correctly. This movie is targeted to 10 year-olds and that's what it is. Your life won't change after seeing it and you won't be talking about it with other adults at the book club meeting. It's a fast-moving, enjoyable film with a nice story and some typical characters. The style is particularly cool with a decidedly retro slant; especially the design of the game.Acting is OK. Tim Robbins is wooden and the kids are smarmy (especially the younger one with the patented ""look sad and confused"" face). 15-year old Kristen Stewart as sister, Lisa, is beautiful and I can see her career growing into one of heavier roles in a few years. She has the eyes, cheek bones and appeal of an actress like, say, Kiera Knightly without the pretension. Though her role in this film is disposable, keep an eye on her in the future.Thankfully, the movie's effects are not ALL CGI and it doesn't get lost in effects-for-effects-sake land. They even use puppets! Where have you gone, Ray Harryhausen?Film makers seem to feel the need for hammering a morality lesson into kid movies and this is no exception. In this case the moral lesson is, ""be kind to your siblings because they may not always be around."" Yeah, OK. thanks. That is a lame 1990's-and-beyond technique that is annoying and plain dumb. Hollywood shouldn't teach us morality, they should entertain us. Just make the movie, dammit.All in all an enjoyable, family-oriented movie that you will watch again on DVD or on TV and enjoy it even more the second time.

Also, for a note, this is a kids movie, so any 15 or older people, stay home and save your money. But what I didn't like about this movie was that the house got so many beatings that you've wondered when the house would collapse on them.

A totally different story after the movie was over I am happy to say.****MAJOR SPOILER ALERT**** The 2 boys in this movie remind me of my brother and myself. Fight! Fight! Fight! was our motto and it is no different here. While the space scenes were a bit far fetched, no space suits, fires burning in space, and of course objects making sound, this is very forgivable. Visuals were stunning, and the lizard aliens were scary enough to have my daughter cover her eyes and peek. The boys acting was superb. They really look like they are fighting on the screen. It gets so bad, when 1 of the boys, Walter, gets a wish card from the game, wishes his brother away and regrets it. Fortuantly for him, he gets a 2nd chance to redeem himself later. I thought it was hilarious that the sister thought the ""brother"" had nice eyes (see the movie for this one) All in all, despite the space flaws, I loved this movie and highly recommend it.

The plot is so slow I worked out who the ""astronaut"" was after five minutes of him arriving, The plot continues to drag on for another nearly 2 hours with lots of unfunny jokes, unoriginal and stupid, doing exactly the same thing as jumanji did but guess what ITS IN SPACE, It really was making a film for the sake of making a film.

I'm a big fan of Chris Van Allsburg's books. I enjoyed Polar Express a lot, but I loved Zathura. Definitely the best movie from his books to date.

197,pepperfluffball,A Very Good Action/Adventure/Sci Fi Family Movie,8,15 December 2005,"When I first heard of this movie, I thought it would just be Jumanji in Space, and worse then Jumanji. I really liked Jumanji when I was a kid, but being nineteen years old, I really don't like it nearly as much now. I see the many flaws, some major and serious, and just dislike it a lot now.When I saw Zathura, I was very impressed and pleasantly surprised. It was very entertaining, funny, and thrilling. It fixed all the flaws of Jumaji and was better in every way. It had some good character development, a small amount of CGI was used, great directing, impressive special effects, it had a nice twist, it had some wonderful one-liners, the acting from the entire cast was really good, there was some great chemistry between the two boys, there were some morals to the story, the Zorgons were actually frightening, etc.I was very impressed with the two leads as well. Jonah Bobo was great as the younger brother. He acted very realistically, wanting to play with his older brother Walter. Josh Hutcherson was also great as Walter, the older brother. He acted like any older brother would, ignoring and being mean to his younger brother. The whole brother hating each other theme was both amusing and extremely realistic.I also liked how the story focused more on the brothers and how they interacted with each other, instead of mainly on the magical board game.I really liked that the movie makes you feel the danger that the kids are going through instead of just looking and pretending to be frightened of CGI creations (like Jumanji). The Zorgons and Robot were real, not fake. The Zorgons were really men in costumes and the robot was a real person in a robot costume. It was realistic in a sense that the danger felt real, not to mention looked real.Kristen Stewart who plays the older teenage sister was also good. She acted like a real teenager who just wants to be left alone and go to sleep. She was underused, but that was the point. The movie is supposed to be centered around the brothers.Dax Shepard was very good in the role of the Astronaut. He was very funny and played the role very well.Tim Robbins was also good in a very small part.I am a nineteen year old female and I enjoyed Zathura immensely.It is enjoyable for any age group. It is not a kid's movie, but a family movie. I guarantee that even adults will enjoy Zathura.Overall, this is a very good film that everyone should see. It is a lot of fun.I would give it an 8 out of 10.",Zathura - A Space Adventure

Hopefully, my girls got the message it was sending and learned something from it. There were some really funny lines in the movie, my favorite being when Walter told the Robot to ""get me a juice box bi-otch""...just a really fun movie for kids of all ages! I hope to see more of those 2 young actors in future movies - they were just great! The little one, Danny, was very cute and funny. I think that kid has a big future in acting. Hope so, anyway. That guy, Dax, who plays the stranded Astronaut looks exactly like Zack Braff from Scrubs and I swore that was who it was.

That said, I find it necessary to mention that I did enjoy Jumanji, so I am probably a bit biased in favor of Zathura.Jumanji in outer space. Of course, you could probably tell that from the trailers...Zathura has its moments, but most had already been portrayed in Jumanji. Every occurrence in the game paralleled those of Jumanji. The vines (robot) the hunter (Zorgons) and the tsunami/stampede (gravitational pull/meteor shower). So much was taken from Jumanji, it was distracting. I could not help but draw comparisons between the two movies while sitting in the theatre. However, in its own right, this movie is awesome. Special effects won me over, the meteor shower especially. These are some of the best special effects I have seen in a while, and that is the reason for my high rating.What you can expect:1. If you liked Jumanji, or if you really love special effects, you will like Zathura (even though David Alan Grier isn't in it).2.

When he learned ""Zathura"" would be the next Van Allsburg book to come to the screen, he made me promise we'd see it.We nearly missed our chance (it was at the second-run theater) but I am glad we made it. ""Zathura"" was excellent- we were riveted the entire time and my son THEN made me promise we'd buy the DVD when it was released! Since one of the main characters was a 10-year old boy like him, naturally I knew he'd like it. But I really liked it too and thought that every actor's performance was exactly right. Not cutesy in that ""movie kid"" kind of way, but very real. I flinched at some of the older brother's dialogue- it was so mean and angry toward the little brother. But that's how it is!! Kids are so mean. This movie did not shy away from it (OK, that set up the ending, but still).Even the teen sister was great. Tim Robbins, as the harried dad (little screen time) was spot-on. Families of divorce have a whole separate set of behavioral rules to learn and live by, and this movie nailed it.Thumbs-up from all of us!",Zathura - A Space Adventure
202,makarovmm,Too intense for young viewers. Should be PG-13,6,28 November 2005,"This movie although similar to Jumanji in plot is much more intense and dark. Should really be rated PG-13. So, if you have a child under say age 9 or so I would not take them to it. Overall, the movie is a series of action scenes as they play the game. Not much plot to speak of. My main concern is that the previews did not give any indication as to how scary the movie might be and the rating of PG is not accurate in my opinion. Adults seeing this movie are likely to be disappointed. The plot as I mentioned before is weak. The action is not enough to sustain the movie. As other reviewers have mentioned it is very similar to Jumanji in that it is based on a boardgame that the kids find and begin to play. At which point various bad things happen. The one plot ""twist"" if you will is predictable ( I won't spoil it.) If you are looking for a good movie to take your kids to, save your money. Older kids and adults will probably find the lack of storyline to be a problem. Go see the next Harry Potter instead.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
203,f-zuch,Good effects but....the screenplay is wretched,3,4 March 2006,"This movie will appeal to the six year olds...and hopefully not to much older.... It was simply a terrible piece of work that went downhill from the opening. If you liked Jimunji, then just watch it again rather than ruin your self with this dreadful film. There is no decent exchange between characters...the set is BORING! Some of the writing for this was so trite and contrived that I thought I would gag!! I was very glad to have it end and even happier to return it ...the same day! The two young actors were poorly directed as well. Tim Robbins is in this for the first five minutes and about the last five minutes....I'm sure he got a decent paycheck but his acting looked flat and as ridiculous as the rest of this thing.

OK, mystery, space kinda thing, two ten year old... Guess what that add ups to? Well boys and girls, 0 + 0 + 0 = ? I'll tell you what it equals...Buttkiss! The movie wasn't great and I didn't think it was from the minute I saw the previews! Disney, take this advice... Stop making retarded movies!!! This isn't the 1990's anymore!

206,noxton-failed,Take care of Zorgons,6,5 May 2006,"I find this movie kind of ridiculous. No one really wants to learn from TV! And even as a naive Child you don't want to. Do not tread your little brother like Walter did, you listen? And never ever wish that your bro would not even have been born! Maybe you gonna end up as an astronaut lost in space. The movie shows how not to do it, how not to tread your brother or father and how you should never ever eat.Maybe I'm a little too sarcastic and it's a real good family movie with heart and a lot to learn from. But I got bad nightmares about the Zorgons. They are really scary! Okay honestly I liked the movie. I think it has great and beautiful pictures, and if you watch it with your kids, they probably will be excited. But one should not try to learn from TV but just enjoy and laugh. I actually had a lot of fun with the film but watched just one single time.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
207,ednashley,Good movie but inappropriate language used,7,7 May 2006,"This was an entertaining and exciting movie. However it seems that lately in movies geared towards children the writers seem to overlook some of the very offensive dialog and language used. Several times in this movie I was shocked and offended by some of the language allowed to slip through unnoticed. I wish that the writers would pause to ask themselves ""would I want my seven year old saying that"" chances are they would answer no, and possibly take some of it out. Call me old fashioned but I am sure they could have found some similar non-offensive alternatives.Otherwise I thought this movie was fun and exciting.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
208,cinemaniacowally,The space odyssey.,8,2 July 2006,"What makes Zathura so great, beyond the incredible visual designs, tense challenges, and a great director, is the fact that it was adapted from a Chris Van Allburg book. The Polar Express was a visionary adventure, and Jumanji, family fun. Zathura doesn't get to be as thrilling and masterful as the animated film by Robert Zemeckis, but innovates ingredients from Jumanji, while at the same time creating new ones. It is a movie of great adventure, infinite inventiveness, and a screenplay that will please anyone in the whole family. Jon Fraveau has an unlimited supply of audacity and he applies every bit of that to Zathura. Then there's the cast, which features a great Josh Hutchersson and one more good Tim Robbins.",Zathura - A Space Adventure

I'll even spot them a point because someone who had never seen Jumanji would find much of Zathura new and exciting.OK, those are my 3 points in my rating.The bickering interaction between the siblings was realistic enough I got to use it as an example to my kids, afterward. I'm not giving it a point because it was irritating enough to get really old.How in the ***** *********!!! can the makers have varied SO incomprehensibly little from Jumanji? Even a sequel needs SOME variety! The Robot (which, by the way, looked pretty cool - I want one) was a dead rip off of Van Pelt. The meteor shower was a dead ripoff of the monsoon. Etc.I'm glad I found it on TV instead of renting it... I certainly would have been finding a way to drop another point off my rating.Never seen Jumanji? Sure... watch this. Have?

211,istein321,Bad Lesson,1,27 December 2009,"I think this movie is OK, with one awful exception. Is it just me or is everyone extremely annoyed by the younger brother? It seems that the writers are saying its OK to do stupid things over and over as long as you keep saying you're sorry. I don't think that is the lesson we want to impart to kids his age. After the tenth time that word looses its meaning. I wish instead that either the sister or the brother would have told him ""Next time you're about to do something that you think you might have to say you're sorry for later, just think of me braking one of your toys, and saying I'm sorry and then another and another... Every time saying Im sorry. The point of being sorry is not doing it again. So very frustrating, especially since I've met both kids and adults like that.",Zathura - A Space Adventure

It mimics Jumanji in every aspect pretty much, but replaces the jungle scene with a more futuristic outer space family adventure.Only complaint about this movie (as a parent) is that it should have been rated PG-13 with the language used. One example,.. 5 minutes in the movie you have a 6 year calling his older brother a ""dick."" Seems a little overboard language wise for a family movie. Would recommend this for kiddos (and adults) 7+.For parents: No death, no over the top violence, few too many curse words for a PG film.",Zathura - A Space Adventure

I just do not think this movie is worth my money to see it. I downloaded it for free, and IT SUCKED.It started off pretty decent, and it got worse and worse until the non-child actor shows up to save the day.

Overall, the movie was a good family movie. It had adventure, suspense, decent story and good humor. The effects were great. Adults and children will have a good time at this movie.My criticism with the movie has to do with the language and the intensity. A few minutes into the movie, the 6 year old brother calls the 8 year old brother a ""DICK"" in front of his dad. Having my 6 year old son and 4 year old daughter next to me made me cringe at this use of the word. While I'm all for appropriately placed language to ""keep it real,"" I didn't see any value in having this word used. It would have been just as effective to have him say ""you are an idiot"" or something else commonly heard on Nick Jr. THe word ""biatch"" was used as well.Finally, there were a couple intense moments in the movie that will remind you of Jurassic Park. My 4 year old daughter had to leave the theater 30 minutes into it. Thankfully, Chicken Run was playing next door. If your child is sensitive to these things skip the movie for another year or two. Otherwise, have a good time but watch the ears...",Zathura - A Space Adventure
218,Baryonyx5,One of the best films I've seen in a long time...,10,1 December 2005,"Even though Harry Potter and Chicken Little seem to have pushed Zathura into a black hole, I think Zathura is a great movie full of heart. Fun to watch. Great visuals spawned by great art direction. The Neo/50's-ish feel of the sci-fi aspect is very refreshing. I was also quite pleased at how the effects weren't always just CG when they could have easily made their visual effect shot list many times longer with on-set neglection. The aliens in the movie bring me back to the days of rubber suited creatures. The look of a puppet/suit for a monster in a movie these days may seem painfully noticeable, But it's done quite well (unlike some cg) and they are always artistically lit (I know...darkness hides your horrible prop, but the aliens look good here and in this movie it's quite appropriate.) If you haven't seen this film, I suggest you do. For a change, it's a movie well worth your ticket price.",Zathura - A Space Adventure

The rating is ""PG""(which I suppose I misunderstood to mean, harmless except for the slightly scary parts)I have seen many a PG movie, and thought they should be rated ""G"", so I felt we were safe in seeing this. My main complaint is I thought the foul language in the movie was unnecessary to the plot, and in my opinion, tainted an otherwise good movie. In the first two minutes, you are assaulted by cursing. We didn't know how much more bad language to expect, and almost walked out. There were two more instances of swearing, that were again, not vital to the plot. It was otherwise a pretty good movie to watch in the theater, but because of the language, we won't be buying it when it comes out on video.",Zathura - A Space Adventure

It was like watching them in action. For the first time they could see themselves in living color. They could see how horrible they treat each other. This film taught my boys a lesson they will not soon forget.If you have children (boys or girls) who just treat each other like crap, then take them to see this movie. It has a moral all wrapped up in action, adventure, intrigue, and edge of your seat excitement. I really loved how the movie inspires kids to be adventurous.

We also liked the Zorgons because they were cool and mean looking. The special effects for the shooting star were neat, and when Danny told his sister that they were meat for the Zorgon's dinner we all laughed. Another thing we found funny was when Lisa wanted to go out on a date with her own brother, not knowing the astronaut was the future Walter.We didn't really like the black hole because it came out of nowhere and didn't really make sense. Finally, we thought that the father character was boring and lame.Overall, we enjoyed it and thought it was a good and fun movie to watch.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
222,lindzm819,"Cute Kid's movie, but unnecessary language.",7,10 February 2009,"Overall, the film was cute, the lead characters were engaging, and the story was entertaining. I was bothered, however, by the unnecessary use of rude language/swearwords. Zathura is marketed as a children's movie, but for some reason the writers decided to allow the words ""dick"", ""hell"", ""ass"", and ""bi-otch"" into the script when there are several perfectly innocent alternatives to get the point across. It was jarring, and would make me hesitant to allow a child prone to parroting movie lines to view it.The word choice jolted me out of the movie's story and instead made me focus on every inappropriate word in the script. Generally, I have no problem with strong language to get an important point across, or in a movie for adults where it is appropriate (loved Superbad, for instance), but here there was no reason for it. Danny could just have easily called Walter a ""jerk"" instead of a ""dick"", and Lisa could just have easily complained that she was freezing her ""butt"" off than her ""ass"". So, if you have an older child who will not repeat everything they hear in movies, or if you don't mind a child using these words, then you should show them Zathura, because it is a cute movie. Otherwise, I would advise that you find a movie with cleaner language, or, better yet, get the book Zathura!",Zathura - A Space Adventure

I found out that Zathura was another movie that would be themed like Jumanji. Zathera... after watching Jumanji, feels like you have seen it before (only back then it had some quality). It is a decent attempt at making another movie for the whole family. When watching you will notice that small children will be very attracted to the plot, but you as adult will be looking at all the mistakes that were made.If you are willing to pass all the obvious mistakes made in this movie.. and just have a laugh every now and then, watch Zathura!",Zathura - A Space Adventure

The special effects in the movie were spectacular. It was still the basic 'jumanji' style story line, but it was a fun film with lots of visuals. The whole theater seemed to enjoy it, and there were actually a few darker scarier scenes that youngsters may find very frightening. My ten year old sister loved it, scared at a few parts too.I would think twice before bringing a child younger than 7 to see it.Over all, good fun film, enjoyable even for a maturer audience. The story, acting, and music was typical, but the sound and visuals effects could arguably fit in with a Star Wars film.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
225,lambrose3,Entertaining Family Fun,7,27 October 2005,"While not for the youngest of kids Zathura was much more entertaining than I anticipated. The fast-paced fun and action kept it moving (for its length, any longer and it might have gotten repetitive), with enough action to hold adult interest.For those looking for movies that virtually the whole family can see (of which there are too few) this one works. With no foul language (the one ""bad word"" is followed by an admonishment not to speak that way), no sexual situations, no blood and all the action exciting (yet fantasy based) it is suitable for those in upper elementary and up. The bad guys and several explosions might be too much for early elementary and younger.The vast majority of the movie is acted by 2 boys (their characters 6 & 10 years old). Their performances were more than adequate to carry the roles. The few other complimentary roles were acceptable. (Ironically, the least successfully acted role in my opinion was the dad, played by the most accomplished actor of the bunch, Tim Robbins. He was o.k., but not his usual self.) All in all Zathura is an entertaining movie of family fun.",Zathura - A Space Adventure

The good: Some genuinely funny parts at the beginning, like the meteor shower scene where Danny yells, ""Grandma,"" as an urn breaks on the fireplace, and when Walter states his maturity by saying, ""I'm in fourth grade. I have a girlfriend."" The bad: obviously anything to do with Dax Sheppard and the whole astronaut bit, especially the ridiculous circumstances regarding his disappearance. Overall, this is a movie for children, but has a couple of amusing moments. Also, any connection with Jumanji is not evident in the least bit. The similarities could have been played up for comedic effect, but were left alone, leading the viewers to assume this is a Jumanji rip-off, and not a movie sequel derived from a book sequel (which it is).",Zathura - A Space Adventure

As an adult, I found that there were no surprises and therefore not much tension.The main problem with this film is the small cast. Having only four main characters, all of whom are extremely two-dimensional, makes it very hard to care what happens to them - jealous little kid, older kid who blames his brother for his parents' divorce, vain older sister, to say nothing of the astronaut who's so wooden he doesn't need an air supply to go into space at one point.... and what on earth was Tim Robbins doing, taking the bit role as the father? Special effects were very good, but nothing we haven't seen before, except for the Zorgons, who looked like they came out of Doctor Who circa. 1976.This would probably have been better if it had been made straight after Jumanji; however it is fortunate that the same writer is responsible for both scripts, as otherwise he would have found it very hard to avoid a charge of plagiarism.Jumanji is back on the television in the next week - I shall watch the original with great enjoyment after seeing its much paler ""sequel"".",Zathura - A Space Adventure
230,juliemedina,thinly disguised lesson in brotherly love,5,10 November 2005,"After a long day of listening to my boys fighting, I decided we all needed to get out of the house and see a movie. I corralled my husband, my daughter and both of my sons into the car. I painstakingly made sure that my daughter sat between the two boys so that they could not kill each other on the drive to the theater. Sure enough, the drive consisted of them reaching across their sister's lap to pinch and poke each other. By the time we reached the theater, all I could think about was how great it was going to be to quietly watch a movie for two hours Little did I know that Zathura is a thinly disguised lesson in brotherly love. Throughout the first half to two-thirds of the movie, the audience is subjected to fight after fight between the two brothers, Danny (played by Jonah Bobo) and Walter (played by Josh Hutcherson). The resemblance to my two sons is uncanny. I believe I even heard the same words and pitch on the screen that I had been subjected to earlier in the daythis was certainly not the relaxing experience I had hoped for when deciding to go to a movie. By the end of the movie, the brothers learn that in order to survive and return home, they must learn to work together. The final scene shows the brothers playing ball together and acting like best friendsyeah right.Zathura, directed by Jon Favreau, is almost an exact replication of Jumanji, released in 1995. The only difference is the age and gender of the participants and the location of the adventure. In Zathura, Danny and Walter decide to play a board game that Danny finds hidden under the stairs. When Danny hits the button to begin the game, meteors bombard the living room, the house breaks away from earth and floats through space. If I hadn't seen Jumanji first, this would have been a good movie. But after seeing Jumanji, this was just way too predictable.As sappy and nauseating as the hour-and-a-half long sermon about getting along with your brother was for me to watch, it seemed to have the desired effect on my sons. As we drove home, my nine-year-old son fell asleep with his head on his older brother's lap.My older son's response as he shrugged his shoulders for emphasis was, ""He was hurting me with his head digging into my shoulder so I moved him."" I might have believed that response if his hand was not protectively wrapped over his younger brothers shoulders. Even though I know that bonding will be short-lived, it is a moment that will go down in history for our family.",Zathura - A Space Adventure

I especially hate how every time he does something wrong, he simply runs away and keeps saying i am sorry, like that suppose to make everything he does fine?

I grew up on Jumanji, and though I am now an 18 year old girl and certainly not the target audience for Zathura, it entertained me completely from start to finish. The script was well written, tight, and surprisingly funny, the film was great looking -- not too gimmicky, unlike most ""special effects movies"" these days -- and most importantly the acting was flawless. Not only are children actors usually pretty unbearable, but I am an active Tim Robbins dissenter, and nevertheless I didn't think that anyone ever made a wrong turn. It is rare to see a movie that I truly think anyone could enjoy, but Zathura is one of them -- and much better than Jumanji (and remember I was 8 when I saw Jumanji and 18 now).

(This is not imperative to the storyline what-so-ever.) Okay. So, maybe it was just us, but did anyone honestly correlate how the 2 time-lines came together? There was a very unnecessary element to the movie, that could have easily been left out. Once you have seen the movie and really thought about it, you will understand what I mean, and that it makes no sense. The movie was amazing till this point, but picked soon after. The director didn't fully think through this one point which inadvertently causes the rest of the movie to lose its magic.However, this movie was still great!

I loved it though it was very scary. I thought it was going to be very bad but it changed and cracked me up as my friends and I watched it. We even started yelling at the TV we were watching it on. Though that might be the fact that they had a really nice TV......hmmmmmmm. It will be stuck in your head forever but you won't want it to go away! It worked it's way into my heart and it will do the same for yours. Just watch out for the Zorgons!!",Zathura - A Space Adventure
237,rabbit19810615,"""Jumanji"" copy cat with out real acting",1,13 December 2005,"Usually I don't write opinions, but after reading the first one IMDb offered (which gave the movie an amazing 10 out of 10) I had to say something.To sum it up : an almost complete copy of jumanji (minus the actors, turns or acting) with out any introduction or real plot which in the end made me glad it was over. Besides the special effects (which today don't mean as much as they did in terms of dedicated work) the movie is as hollow as possible.The idea of a game that takes two children in outer space is very well played (NOT !!!) by the amazingly 4 (beginer ?) actors. The conflicts are very poorly described and the reactions exaggerated and hilarious (in a bad way).So to sum it up, you get a lot more if you go and rent / buy 'Jumanji' - you'll change losing one hour and a half for a great movie.PS Considering the amazing high score it has until now, this movie is either heavily promoted by the staff (meaning they directly voted here :D) or children really recognize themselves in the two parodies of main characters, which may be a lot worse.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
238,bhall1-1,"""Zathura"" is a wondrous adventure, sparking the imagination and stimulating the minds of young children.",8,18 December 2005,"""Zathura"" is a wondrous adventure, sparking the imagination and stimulating the minds of young children. The film begins with two warring brothers spending the weekend with their overstressed and overworked father (Tim Robbins). Six-year-old Danny (Jonah Bobo) is constantly seeking acceptance and attention from his older ten-year-old brother Walter (Josh Hutcherson) whom views Danny as a nuisance. When left in the care of their self-absorbed teenage sister Lisa (Kristen Stewart), Danny finds an ancient tin game named ""Zathura"" in the basement of their father's new home. Though reluctant, Walter plays the game along with Danny. ""Zathura"" quickly reveals it's supernatural powers sending the two boys and their older sister on a thrilling adventure. Trapped in outer space, battling wicked aliens and an evil robot, an astronaut (Dax Shepard) appears. While giving them assistance throughout their race to finish the game, the astronaut teaches them a valuable lesson along the way.The writing, direction, special effects and acting are all excellent in this film. ""Zathura"" is an extraordinary picture with first-rate visual effects and superb acting. Jonah, Josh, and Kristen all give a wonderful performance portraying feuding siblings under great distress as their home magically hovers through an intergalactic setting. ""Zathura"" was created in the mind of the Caldecott Medal-winning author Chris Van Allsburg whom is known for attracting both children and adults to his surrealist illustrated fantasies (""Jumanji"" and ""The Polar Express""). The film was directed by Jon Favreau (""Elf"") and released by Columbia Pictures. This movie is rated ""PG"" for fantasy action, peril and language.""Zathura"" is a unique family film that provides strong moral lessons on the value and importance of family. It also demonstrates the advantages of working together to solve problems. I believe children are going to love this movie and adults will enjoy it just as much for the way it brings back feelings of juvenile fantasy.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
239,lynda66,i'm watching this movie right now,10,29 June 2007,"as a member of blockbuster.com, i am currently in the situation where i feel like i've seen EVERYTHING! I was starting to get burnt out on movies, finding nothing lately that was unique, riveting or unpredictable. This movie is charming & refreshing! It's a great movie!I've seen Josh Hutcherson before, in LITTLE MANHATTAN, which is another favorite of mine. Dax Shepard is actually becoming one of my favorite actors, also. The little boy, Jonah Bobo, is adorable & Jon Favreau will always be one of my all time favorite people in the industry! (MADE is one of my top 3 movies of all time!) I wouldn't hesitate to strongly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
240,pianist_93,Great,10,6 April 2006,"I loved it!!! That was a good movie. Josh Hutcherson is really good. I think that if my sister and I were characters, I would be most like Walter and my sister would be more like Danny. My mom was like that killer robot!!!!!!!!!!!!!! People should totally see this movie because it rocks. My mom even asked me if I had learned the lesson in the Zathura, and I said ""movies are there to entertain you (which Zathura did a great job of doing), NOT to teach you a lesson. And even if there WAS a lesson in there, I was too busy looking at Josh Hutcherson's face!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He's been really busy lately, eh? I'd love to make movies and travel the world, that kind of thing... Later",Zathura - A Space Adventure
241,Nednehsa,Surprisingly nice. If I was a kid I'd have loved it........,8,6 August 2006,"There are quite a few nice things about this film. In particular, Zathura is an aesthetically intelligent film. The makers did a great job of not relying too heavily on CGI; very thoughtful design and effects. The convincing use of miniatures, real sets and chaos/destruction really brought the story to life. True, its a kids movie. But not so much that it annoys, there's a timeless and attractive notion of adventure. Really hearkens back to the glory of 80's kids adventure movies. The film's gadgets and knick-knacks were great. The house and Zathura game-board were both characters in and of themselves, every bit as important as the actors (who did a fine job). Throughout I felt like I was watching a little of ""Time Bandits"" mixed with some ""Goonies"" and maybe some ""Hitchikers Guide..."" or ""House"".Some folks seem ambivalent to the film. That's unfortunate. Up against a lot of the uninspired sh*t that is released these days, Zathura is very successful in creating a fun and visually convincing escape. Half way through the movie I realized that I was waiting/anticipating the film's failure, that it was going to let me down. Never did. I appreciated the film.",Zathura - A Space Adventure
