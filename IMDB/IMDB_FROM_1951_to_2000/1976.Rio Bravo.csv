0,MartinHafer,It only gets better each time I see it.,9,9 July 2009,"I noticed that a few reviewers gave RIO BRAVO scores of 10. Well, I certainly can understand this, as it is one of the better Westerns you can see, but I also am very hesitant to toss out 10s--as not many movies are perfect enough to merit this score. And, while I loved RIO BRAVO, I also must admit that there are a few films of the genre that are better...though not many.One thing I noticed as I saw this film again today is that it is so much better than I'd remembered. Some of this might be because there are a lot of details about films and film making I notice now that I have a bazillion film reviews behind me--I couldn't help but learn a little bit after seeing so many films. Some of it might also be that despite me knowing the plot and knowing exactly what would happen, it just didn't get old--it was that well made.Now the plot itself is amazingly simple and is not 100% new (hence, my giving the film a 9). The idea of a lawman or group of lawmen refusing to give up a murderer to a rich and powerful boss and steadfastly enforcing the law is such a classic plot line. However, this film is a great example of taking a standard plot yet making it come alive due to such incredibly deft direction. Howard Hawks was a master director with a ton of wonderful films to his credit. You can really tell he knew his craft, as he brought so much out of the actors and situation. In some ways, I even preferred it over the John Ford style, as Ford is usually very, very heavy on the sentimentality. Here, while there is a tiny bit, the emphasis seems to be more on character development, redemption and the individual's interactions with each other. Somewhat similar to Ford--just with less of the lovely schmaltz that Ford did so well. I love both style--and it's amazing that Hawks really only made a few Westerns.In some ways, this film seems a bit surprising for a John Wayne film. While Wayne is naturally known for his extreme manliness in his movies, here he is more complex and vulnerable. First, his romantic pairing with a much younger Angie Dickenson is odd but somehow they make it work and bring out a bit more complexity to his character. Second, there is a lot of wonderful male bonding in the film--and a lot of tenderness. This is not a homophobic film, as the men truly seem to love and care for each other in a way you often don't see in Westerns. It's not all toughness but the vulnerability of the characters (especially Dean Martin) was endearing. Also, while it was very, very atypical of Wayne, I loved the scene where he kissed Walter Brennan on top of the head--it was wonderful and made me laugh. It's funny, because as it was about to happen I said to myself that if Wayne should kiss Brennan, it would be the perfect scene...and then he did! One thing that worried me about the film was that in several Wayne films of the late 50s and into the early 70s, Wayne had young pop singers play important roles. While this sometimes worked, sometimes the acting and characters didn't really pan out well (such as Bobby Vinton playing Wayne's son in BIG JAKE). Here, fortunately, Ricky Nelson actually was a positive addition. Not only did his acting seem polished (after years of playing on ""Ozzie and Harriet"") but his singing actually worked well--even if the style was anachronistic to the Old West. I particularly liked his little duet with Dean Martin. As for Martin, he showed that despite the Matt Helm films and his laid back attitude towards acting in the 70s, he was a terrific actor.As for everyone else, they were in top form. Wayne was a gentler and more believable guy--but still the John Wayne everyone wanted to see. Walter Brennan was downright hilarious as the cantankerous old cuss he grew into in his later years (though he was actually a bit younger than he looked and acted). Angie Dickenson also had more depth and appeal than usual. Interestingly, Hawks and the script put so much emphasis on the good guys that the bad guys were almost an after-thought. This isn't a bad thing, as the film chose instead to deal with the way the good guys got along and worked together as friends.Exceptional direction, great acting and a top-notch script, this is a fine film and one any fan of Westerns or John Wayne simply has to watch. I liked the trivia section of IMDb and its entry that says ""Quentin Tarantino has said that before he enters into a relationship with a girl, he always shows her 'Rio Bravo' and if she doesn't like it, there is no relationship."" I would agree. Anyone who doesn't like this film after seeing it isn't to be trusted! By the way, although I love this film, I am less in love with EL DORADO. A decade later, Hawks basically redid RIO BRAVO (again, with Wayne) and it offers no improvements at all over the original. Hawks denied that it was a remake and if you believe that, I'll sell you some oceanfront property in Colorado! It's watchable, but you see the two side-by-side, there's simply no comparison.",Rio Bravo
1,TheLittleSongbird,It is a good movie but it is overlong and too slow,7,23 June 2010,"I am not the biggest fan of westerns, but I have liked a lot of what I've seen. Rio Bravo I accept has been acclaimed, but when I saw it myself, I liked it but I wouldn't go to say it is the best western ever. Starting with its problems, it is much too long, it could have done with being 8-10 minutes shorter. Also I have seen reviews not on here that say it is majestically paced but I cannot say I agree, I for one found it too slow. While there was some good acting, Angie Dickinson does overdo her part and it doesn't help her character and situation are both underdeveloped. So what were the good things? Well the scenery and cinematography are magnificent, the score rousing, haunting and bombastic, the story intriguing, the dialogue excellent and the direction superb. And John Wayne, while he has been better, does give a good and charismatic performance in the lead, while Dean Martin is likable enough and Walter Brennan is wonderful. Overall, it is good but not as good as I'd heard it was. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Rio Bravo
2,bkoganbing,"""You Can Do Just About Anything You Want To, Chance.""",9,1 August 2006,"Howard Hawks initially wanted to reunite John Wayne and Montgomery Clift who had worked so well together in Red River in his second film with Wayne. Clift however was at the beginning of the slide that would ultimately destroy him in seven years and said no. It was then that Dean Martin was cast as John Wayne's alcoholic deputy. By the way if Clift had done the part it would have reunited him with Walter Brennan also who is playing a very similar part to the one he did in Red River in relation to Wayne.In the wordless beginning of Rio Bravo, Wayne while going into the town saloon to fetch Dino, witnesses a cold blooded killing perpetrated by Claude Akins. Akins is the no good brother of rich rancher John Russell who keeps trying to spring Akins from Wayne's jail. He also brings in some hired guns who bottle the town up.Both Howard Hawks and John Wayne absolutely hated High Noon and made Rio Bravo as their answer to it. This sheriff doesn't go around begging for help from the townspeople he's sworn to protect. He's supposed to be good enough to handle the job himself with some help from only a few good men.Dean Martin said that the Rio Bravo role for him was one of the most difficult. At that time he was playing a drunk on stage and was not yet into the substance abuse problems that beset him later on. But turns in a stellar performance.This film marked the farewell feature film performance of Ward Bond who took some time from his Wagon Train TV series to play the small role of a Wayne friend who offers to help and gets killed for his trouble. Fitting it should be in the starring film of his best friend John Wayne.The only bad note in Rio Bravo is that of Ricky Nelson who is too much the nice kid from Ozzie and Harriet to suggest being a young gun. But Rio Bravo marked the first of many films Wayne used a current teenage idol to insure box office. Later on Frankie Avalon, Fabian, Bobby Vinton all the way down to Ron Howard in The Shootist brought a younger audience in for the Duke. James Caan who played the Ricky Nelson part in El Dorado was much superior to Nelson. Then again, Caan is an actor. But I will say that Dean and Ricky sung real pretty.When you hear Dean singing My Rifle, Pony, and Me in the jailhouse, you might recognize the same melody from Red River as Settle Down. Dimitri Tiomkin wrote it and Dean recorded it as well as the title song for Capitol records. At Capitol Dino did mostly ersatz Italian ballads, it was what he was identified with. When he switched to Reprise, Dino started doing far more country and western and it really starts with the songs he did in Rio Bravo.Rio Bravo is a leisurely paced western, probably one of the slowest John Wayne ever did. But Howard Hawks created some characters and a story that hold the interest through out.",Rio Bravo
3,Leofwine_draca,Flawed western with some great action set-pieces,6,29 September 2016,"I'm no big fan of John Wayne and truth be told I haven't watched very many of his films at all. My main interest in seeing RIO BRAVO is that it served as a big inspiration on John Carpenter's ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, and as a massive fan of Carpenter I knew I had to watch it. Having just watched it, I can report that it's an involved and engaging western, one with flaws but which overcomes these by offering strong action scenes and good characterisation. The similarities to the Carpenter film are fewer than expected, as this doesn't have any of the siege action I was expecting.The plot sees Wayne and his buddies holding a notorious criminal in their town jail while the guy's gang members and brother attempt to free him. There's little more to it than that, and it's a decent template for thrills and action. The shoot-outs in this film are well directed and exciting, and the large scale climax approaches brilliance. However, the film does drag in places with the overlong running time. Angie Dickinson is an arresting presence for sure, but her romance scenes with Wayne feel unnecessary (not to mention unbelievable). Dean Martin lends solid support as the drunken aide, but that whole sub-plot of him getting drunk and taken advantage of feels a bit redundant too. Still, it's a fine-looking film, and western fans will lap it up.",Rio Bravo
4,SnoopyStyle,Classic John Wayne Western,8,24 December 2013,"Sheriff John T. Chance (John Wayne) is holding Joe Burdette (Claude Akins) for killing an unarmed man. Only Joe's brother Nathan (John Russell) wants Joe freed, and he'll use everything in his powers. The only hope Chance has is a drunk (Dean Martin), a kid (Ricky Nelson), and ol' Stumpy (Walter Brennan).This is classic John Wayne at his finest. He is the great gunslinger facing insurmountable odds who takes on the bad guys with his brains, his determination, and his skills. Directed by Howard Hawks, this is just a great old fashion western. They even have Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson sing-along. Angie Dickinson plays the romantic lead. Sure, it is cliché. The good guys always win in the end. But there's nothing wrong with that.",Rio Bravo
5,Prismark10,Firing too slowly,6,6 October 2013,"Rio Bravo is a sprawling, over long western hindered with messy pacing.Essentially it is a town under siege story which was better remade as an unpretentious B movie in 1976 called 'Assault on Precinct 13.'John Wayne plays Sheriff Chance who takes in one of the Burdette brothers for murder and has to wait a week for the US Marshall to arrive.In the meantime the other brother along with hired thugs are out to spring him from jail.The only help Chance gets is from a former deputy but now a drunk played by Dean Martin, an old timer deputy played by Walter Brennan and a young hot shot gunslinger played by Ricky Nelson.The film has time to throw in a love interest in the shape of Angie Dickinson for John Wayne which looks peculiar given the age gap. It would had made more sense for her to pair up with Dean Martin.Although the film is regarded as a Howard Hawks classic. It is slow. The languid pacing takes a lot of getting used to.In fact it makes the film dull as you have to wait ages for a decent shoot out.",Rio Bravo
6,classicsoncall,"""If I'm going to get shot at, I might as well get paid for it. How do I get a badge?""",8,5 June 2008,"Not only is ""Rio Bravo"" one of the greatest Westerns ever, but it's about the most fun you'll have watching one too. For that, you'll have to credit an eclectic casting decision matching Dean Martin as a drunken deputy with the Duke himself, and nineteen year old teenage heartthrob Ricky Nelson as a sharp shooting gunslinger who throws in with the good guys. Round it out with Walter Brennan's finely tuned stereotypical turn as a real McCoy deputy sheriff and you've got the ingredients for an entertaining Western. And oh yes, I don't want to forget Angie Dickinson as the romantic interest for Sheriff John T. Chance (John Wayne), but at twenty eight, she didn't look like the kind of girl who'd go for the fifty two year old Duke, looking more like ten years older. I think if you play the picture in your head without her, you'd still have a decent outcome, even if someone else had to throw the flowerpot.Say, could you have picked two better Western character actors than Claude Akins and Myron Healey to challenge the Dude (Dean Martin) with the old coin in the spittoon trick? You know, they weren't on screen very long, but if you follow the genre as a fan, it's always a kick to pick out the players in even the most minor roles. Then there's John Russell, someone I'll always remember first as the ""Lawman"", but for some weird reason, I think I like him better as a villain. Trouble is, his screen time here wasn't nearly long enough to establish a sinister presence like the role of regulator Stockburn in Clint Eastwood's ""Pale Rider"" a couple of decades later. Still, I'll take him in a heartbeat if it means facing down the guys in white hats.The only thing that really catches you off guard in the story is when the good guys are holed up at the jail, and Dino breaks into song accompanied by Rick Nelson on guitar. Roy Rogers used to do that a lot too, even when he was behind bars! It's a nice diversion even if not very believable, especially when Stumpy (Brennan) knows the words to the song too! I guess what makes the picture work above all is the way Chance stays behind his guys through thick and thin, even when it looks like he's throwing them over. Especially effective are the scenes with Stumpy, played for comic effect, but always with some introspection and wise advice laid in between the lines. On the surface, it's not the kind of team you'd select if you were choosing sides for a pick up game, but when the dust settles, it's the one you'll have the most fun with and still win the contest.",Rio Bravo
7,gavin6942,One of the All-Time Classic Westerns,8,19 May 2013,"A small-town sheriff (John Wayne) in the American West enlists the help of a cripple (Walter Brennan), a drunk (Dean Martin), and a young gunfighter (Ricky Nelson) in his efforts to hold in jail the brother of the local bad guy.First of all, let us just say this is one of the all-time great westerns and Howard Hawks does the job right. I am not going to critique it because the film speaks for itself and has built up a reputation of excellence.What I will say is how interesting the influence of this film is. Apparently, it was made in response to ""High Noon"", which would make it a conservative answer to a liberal film. What makes this most interesting is who it has influenced: Quentin Tarantino and John Carpenter, both of whom are probably quite liberal (Carpenter certainly is).Carpenter's admiration of Hawks is a story all in itself, both with this film (which he remade as ""Assault on Precinct 13"") and with Hawks in general.",Rio Bravo
8,jboothmillard,Rio Bravo,7,16 June 2008,"From director Howard Hawks (Scarface - 1932, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes), this is a western might not have the biggest amount of plot and be a tiny bit lengthy, and yet it is a good classic. Basically Sheriff John T. Chance (John Wayne) in a small town of Southwest Texas must keep custody of murderer Joe Burdette (Claude Akins) whose brother, powerful rancher Nathan Burdette (John Russell) is trying to help him escape. After a friend is killed, Chance gets new deputies, a disgraced drunk, Dude (singer Dean Martin), a young gunslinger, Colorado Ryan (singer Ricky Nelson) and an old cripple, Stumpy (Walter Brennan), and they must hold out against Burdette's hired guns till the marshal arrives. Meanwhile, the only subplot worth mentioning is Chance and his relationship with mysterious beauty Feathers (Angie Dickinson). Also starring Ward Bond as Pat Wheeler, Pedro Gonzalez Gonzalez as Carlos Robante and Estelita Rodriguez as Consuela Robante. Wayne is very good, Brennan is fantastic with that accent, and when the story actually sees some action it is very fun to watch. It may not be the most sophisticated and high action western (in my opinion), it may be quite simple, but it is a good western all the same. John Wayne was number 56 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 13 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men. Very good!",Rio Bravo
9,rmax304823,"""We don't like tin horns around here, Mister.""",8,28 January 2007,"A thoroughly enjoyable Western, directed by Howard Hawks and featuring John Wayne, Dean Martin, Walter Brennan, and Ricky Nelson. Hawks was at his best here. Everything in the film is strictly utilitarian. The camera shoots only from eye level. The set design, props, and wardrobe are perfunctory, sort of generically ""western."" Hawks doesn't reach for anything beyond the immediate pleasure of watching what's on the screen. No messages, except maybe that friends have to stick together and that pride doesn't goeth before a fall but rather is an intrinsically admirable quality.Hawks takes a boyish delight in having his characters display a kind of boy-scout level ingenuity. You want to knock Sheriff John Wayne out? You simply string a line across the bottom of the staircase, have a woman scream, and when Wayne comes rushing down the stairs he trips over the line and is knocked conveniently out. Maybe you want to have two people communicate with one another without revealing their presence. You have them creep around and whistle to one another like bird imitators. This device is used not only out of doors (at night) but inside a big hotel. It might be argued that big hotels don't have birds in their hallways but who cares? The film rarely deals seriously with any of its elements. Yes, Dean Martin is a recovering alcoholic (barely) and there is occasional genuine friction between him and Wayne, and of course there is the question of seeing justice done, but it's all handled rather lightly. The problems are all overwhelmed by the humor that Hawks and screenwriter Furthman have laid on. Gonzales-Gonzales contributes mightily to the amusement quotient. When Wayne learns that Angie Dickinson, who has the hots for him, has stayed up all night to protect him, he tells Gonzales-Gonzales, ""Well, you can . . . tell her for me that . . . the fool."" Gonzales-Gonzales: ""Jew want me to tell her that sheece a fool?"" Wayne: ""What? No! I'll tell her myself."" Gonzalez-Gonzalez: ""Jew are going to tell her that sheece a fool?"" It isn't that funny in print but the way the two actors play this scene is exquisite.Props are there mainly to provide little details of interest, some important and some not, but they wouldn't be there in the first place if they weren't going to be used. A black hat. A set of six shooters. A potted plant.The inevitable climactic shoot out dissolves into outright mischief. The good guys have the bad guys penned up in a warehouse and practically squealing with joy they bombard the building with sticks of dynamite, seeing who can throw farthest or most accurately. Everybody joins in the fun and a good time is had by all, including the viewer.Hawks decided to make ""Rio Bravo"" after watching ""High Noon,"" a story about a sheriff who goes around town asking for help and gets none. ""High Noon"" is sometimes interpreted as a metaphor for the McCarthy witch hunts. Anyone accused of having been a communist was automatically alienated from the community and deserted by his friends. Hawks was disgusted by the message, as undoubtedly John Wayne and, especially, Ward Bond were. ""Rio Bravo"" was designed to serve as a riposte to the earlier film, but none of that shows on the screen. What we see on the screen are a crew and cast that seem to be having enormous fun.",Rio Bravo
10,ma-cortes,Involving and fascinating Western masterfully directed by Howard Hawks,8,5 January 2010,"John Chance (John Wayne) is the marshal of a Texas border little town who imprisons gunslinger Joe (Claude Atkins) into jail for being brought to justice. But the Joe's brother is a corrupt baron land named Nathan(John Russell) . Then Chance takes on a blockade of gunfighters . He along with a cripple old(Walter Brennan ) are besieged and only helped by a drunk (Dean Martin) and a cocky youngster (Ricky Nelson)as hired hand . Meanwhile the tough Wayne falls in love with an enigmatic young (Angie Dickinson).Action western, an agreeable love story, shoot-outs at regular intervals, and humor abounds in this magnificent film whose characters are splendidly portrayed. It packs larger-than-life characters, uproarious events and lively happenings. The Duke carries strong acting on his brawny shoulders and perfectly does. The picture is mainly lifted out by veteran Brennan's wonderfully acting as a half-crazed sympathetic old man , whose finger itches demoniacally on the trigger every time he gets a nasty guy in his sights. And of course, top-drawer Dean Martin with an unexpected excellent playing as alcoholic . Colorful Technicolor cinematography by Russell Harlan who adds much to the setting of this unique Western. Marvelous musical score by Dimitri Tiomkin including the Mexican ¨Degueyo¨, music played during ¨El Alamo¨ siege. This overlong, too much-acclaimed and very gripping Western will appeal to John Wayne fans. Rating : Above average, essential and indispensable Western , a masterpiece horse opera whose reputation has improved over the years.It's followed by ¨El Dorado¨in similar style with a hot-headed James Caan as Mississipi who is a virtual retreat of the previous young sidekick named Colorado-Ricky Nelson. Howard Hawks also displays a number of similarities to the posterior ¨Rio Lobo¨ staring Wayne, Victor French, Jorge Rivero and again with an old short-tempered person played by Jack Elam. Furthermore, a semi-remake on modern times by John Carpenter was called ¨Assault on Precinct 13¨.",Rio Bravo
11,moonspinner55,"Long but cheerful, colorful Howard Hawks western...",8,9 February 2008,"A marvelous, rather witty oater in old Hollywood's best style. Dean Martin plays a drunken Texas sheriff saddled with a volatile situation: he's got custody of a killer who's in league with his strong arm brother, a well-known rancher who promises to set him free; the sheriff enlists the aid of a drifting cowboy, a cantankerous old coot, and a guitar-pickin' kid to outwit them. Howard Hawks directed western-lite is underpopulated, but is nevertheless full of wily good cheer, shootin', spittin' and singin'. John Wayne's cowboy is matched up quite nicely with ex-shady lady Angie Dickinson, while scene-stealing Walter Brennan gets most of the funny lines. Hawks later tried to duplicate this film's success with the lookalikes ""El Dorado"" in 1966 and ""Rio Lobo"" in 1970, both starring Wayne, but this is the one you want. Handsomely produced and shot; a whole lotta fun. ***1/2 from ****",Rio Bravo
12,Quinoa1984,a damn entertaining *classic* western,9,30 July 2005,"There's almost a kind of bridge between the westerns of old and the sort of last legs of the western in this film- it has the good ol' sensibilities of the classics (loyalty, honor, the power of the sheriff, the quirkiness and durability of the ones around him, shoot-outs), while also giving some room for some more modern ones (Dean Martin as 'Dude', Angie Dickinson as 'feathers', and the overall excitement). It has a song at one point (obviously for one its stars, the late Ricky Nelson, a popular singer at the time). It has the crotchety, funny old man (Walter Brennan as Stumpy, one of his best roles). And, of course, the 'Duke' John Wayne, who has his usual swagger and qualities that make him a prime figure of the 'male' in films. This time though, he does have some of his tough exterior shed away a little, maybe.Howard Hawks, if nothing else, is most powerful as a storyteller, doing almost nothing with the style of his camera to be creative except to shoot these people, going through the motions. The story, which later was used as a basis for John Carpeneter's Assault on Precinct 13, has Wayne as the Sheriff and Dean Martin as his on and off again drunken deputy 'Dude', who have to look after a criminal in their jail, as he has a brother with a gang who are plotting to break him out. As the Sheriff, or Chance as he's called, has to deal with this, he also has the woman, and the old man, and Dude (Martin is great in the film, maybe the best male performance of the lot), not to mention the hot-to-trot young gunslinger played by Nelson.In all, it's the kind of genre film that should be taken seriously on one hand, but on the other, its meant to be a rollicking good time through the less tense and exciting parts (and there are quite a few from a director who once said that 'there's no action without danger). It lacks a kind of urgency that some of Hawks' other films have, and occasionally Wayne is a little too much ""The Duke"" to see if he's really giving a well-rounded performance as the sheriff. But besides that, it makes for some very memorable moments, a slick ending, and some endearing performances. It's also a film that takes its characters to heart as much as its story; a credit to screenwriters Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett (the later one of my favorites of the period). Not quite a masterpiece, but its definitely worth watching at least once if you're getting into the genre.",Rio Bravo
13,wes-connors,"John Wayne, Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson Draw a Crowd for Howard Hawks",8,29 December 2010,"""On one side is an army of gunmen dead-set on springing a murderous cohort from jail. On the other is Sheriff John T. Chance (John Wayne) and his two deputies: one a recovering drunkard (Dean Martin), the other a crippled codger (Walter Brennan). Also in their ragtag ranks are an unseasoned, trigger-happy youth (Ricky Nelson) and a woman with a past (Angie Dickinson) - and her eye on Chance. Director Howard Hawks lifted the Western to new heights with 'Red River'. Capturing the legendary West with a stellar cast in peak form, he does it again here,"" according to the Special Edition DVD description.Mr. Hawks' ""Red River"" is in a class of its own, and though ""Rio Bravo"" does not approach the heights promised by the above comparison, it's still an excellent film. Hawks goes off on some tangents, but they're worth watching; it's not really that ""Rio Bravo"" is too long, but that some of its length seems not to add much. Interesting, too, is how Mr. Wayne further develops his persona under Hawks' direction. Perhaps unexpectedly, Mr. Martin excels in a dramatic role which seems written for him. Mr. Nelson exudes youthful sex appeal like few other teen idols. There is certainly a lot of charisma on screen.Martin and Nelson were both very successful in another field, and you'll hear a sample. Johnny Cash wrote a superb song for Rick to sing in this film, which appeared on his ""Ricky Sings Again"" LP and was the lead track of a hit EP. A listen to the song ""Restless Kid"" will reveal why it wasn't included. It couldn't be a title song since it is about Nelson's ""Colorado"" character exclusively. And if inserted where Nelson and Martin sing a couple of folksy tunes, ""Restless Kid"" would have stopped the show. Come to think about it, that might not have been a bad idea. Still, see ""Rio Bravo"" for some iconic performances.******** Rio Bravo (3/18/59) Howard Hawks ~ John Wayne, Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, Angie Dickinson",Rio Bravo
14,sunwarrior13,A Great Western,10,26 October 2012,"When it comes down to naming the best Western of all time, the list usually narrows to three completely different pictures: John Ford's The Searchers, Howard Hawks's Red River, and Hawks's Rio Bravo. About the only thing they all have in common is that they all star John Wayne. But while The Searchers is an epic quest for revenge and Red River is a sweeping cattle-drive drama, Rio Bravo is on a much more modest scale.This Western film directed by Howard Hawks and starring John Wayne, Dean Martin, and Ricky Nelson. The supporting cast includes Angie Dickinson, Walter Brennan, and Ward Bond. The script was written by Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett, based on a short story by B.H. McCampbell.Presidio County Sheriff John T. Chance is holding Joe Burdette, a worthless, drunken thug, for the murder of an unarmed man in a fight in a saloon where the problem is that Joe is the brother of wealthy land baron Nathan Burdette, who owns a big chunk of the county and can buy all the hired guns he doesn't already have working for him. Burdette's men cut the town off to prevent Chance from getting Joe into more secure surroundings, and then the hired guns come in, waiting around for their chance to break him out of jail. Chance has to wait for the United States marshal to show up, in six days, his only help from Stumpy, a toothless, cantankerous old deputy with a bad leg who guards the jail, and Dude, his former deputy, who's spent the last two years stumbling around in a drunken stupor over a woman that left him. Chance's friend, trail boss Pat Wheeler, arrives at the outset of the siege and tries to help, offering the services of himself and his drovers as deputies, which Chance turns down, saying they're not professionals and would be too worried about their families to be good at anything except being targets for Burdette's men; but Chance does try to enlist the services of Wheeler's newest employee, a callow-looking young gunman named Colorado Ryan, who politely turns him down, saying he prefers to mind his own business. In the midst of all of this tension, Feathers, a dance hall entertainer, arrives in town and nearly gets locked up by Chance for cheating at cards, until he finds out that he was wrong and that she's not guilty this starts a verbal duel between the two of them that grows more sexually intense as the movie progresses and she finds herself in the middle of Chance's fight. Wheeler is murdered by one of Burgette's hired guns who is, in turn, killed by Dude in an intense confrontation in a saloon. Colorado throws in with Chance after his boss is killed and picks up some of the slack left by Dude, who isn't quite over his need for a drink or the shakes that come with trying to stop. Chance and Burdette keep raising the ante on each other, Chance, Dude, and Colorado killing enough of the rancher's men that he's got to double what he's paying to make it worth the risk, and the undertaker gets plenty of business from Burdette before the two sides arrive at a stalemate Burdette is holding Dude and will release him in exchange for Joe. This leads to the final, bloody confrontation between Chance and Burdette, where the wagons brought to town by the murdered Wheeler play an unexpected and essential role in tipping the balance.This most entertaining of movies also achieved some notoriety in the '90s when Quentin Tarantino revealed that he uses it as a litmus test for prospective girlfriends. Oh, and if the configuration of characters sounds familiar, it should: Hawks remade Rio Bravo two more times. Added to that,a comic western that ambles through its two hours and 21 minutes, it always has time to pause for a joke, a song or banter among the characters.Despite its slickness, virility, occasional humor and, if it may be repeated, authentic professional approach, it is well-made but awfully familiar fare.But nevertheless,it happens to be one of the best Westerns ever made.",Rio Bravo
15,searchanddestroy-1,An indoor western masterpiece,10,5 April 2021,"That's the main reason why some are western authentic lovers may not prefer this one compared to for instance THE SEARCHERS, another masterpiece, directed by John Ford, and set in superb settings, as a real western would suppose to be. But RIO BRAVO remains an outstanding character study and symphony, a terrific atmosphere, and a very good Dimitri Tiomkin score, but unfortunately with a unsurprising scheme, that could easily be written on a subway ticket, and of course a more than expected ending. Yes, most scenes of this Howard Hawks feature take place indoors, except some street sequences. That may disturb western lovers, because most of westerns give breathtaking settings. This one, not. But that remains a must see for every movie buff. And that's not Quentin Tarantino who will tell the contrary. Nor John Carpenter. The most performance of Hawks was to make a so captivating film, with such a simple topic, and fill the two hours and twenty minutes without any boredom for the audiences, simply with the characters presence.

16,hitchcockthelegend,The good outweighs the bad in Hawks macho movie.,7,4 March 2008,"Filmed by Howard Hawks as a response to what he saw as none macho cinema in Gary Cooper's acclaimed High Noon, Rio Bravo has moments of brilliance that are sadly coupled with failings that are not Hawksian peccadilloes. The macho plot is simple but wholly effective as our heavily out numbered heroes (John Wayne, Dean Martin, Walter Brennan & Ricky Nelson) defend a jail house against a marauding mob trying to release an incarcerated friend. This alone sounds grand but the truth is, is that it takes the film nigh on close to 100 minutes to get to the adrenalin rush of the siege and even allowing for fine character development, the film is ponderous and even at times dangerously close to being self indulgent.The casting of Ricky Nelson was (as is widely regarded now) one of the worst of its kind in the history of cinema, he was there purely as a marketing ploy to garner the teen audience who were bopping to his pop tunes way back then. In fairness to Hawks, though, he saw straight away that this was out of Nelson's league and promptly (and cutely) gave him few lines of note to speak of. Also a big negative in the film is Angie Dickinson as the Female interest, she is raw and fresh out of water, and it shows, just like sushi on your plate.The bonuses with the film however keep the film talked about for ever more, Wayne is magnetic and believable, whilst Martin comes into his own as the drunk trying to do right, a superlative performance from him and one would think that is really down to Hawks' direction. The action sequences are of a high standard, while the tight intimate feel of the town is precious - and who can resist an ending that makes you want to go fire yer guns in the air?A very good film, but not a Western masterpiece by a long shot. 7/10",Rio Bravo

Hawks elicits two really good performances from John Wayne and Dean Martin; Walter Brennan is superb as the cranky old deputy and Ricky Nelson puts in a creditable performance as the eye-candy gun-for-hire. Unusually, the leading lady - Angie Dikckenson - gets a bit more to get her teeth into; and as such this makes for a more rounded adventure. Sure, it's still all formulaic stuff - there is rarely any jeopardy; but it's a great watch. We even get a duet between Martin & Nelson!",Rio Bravo

Chance must hold off the brother and his hired guns until the federal marshal arrives. Helping him is a cantankerous old man named Stumpy (Walter Brennan), a deputy with a drinking problem named Dude (Dean Martin), and Colorado, a young man new in town but good with a gun (Ricky Nelson).Duke is excellent. Contrary to some of the negative reviews here, he's not ""just playing John Wayne."" But he always was an under-appreciated actor, especially among certain types. As for his love interest Angie Dickinson, despite the age difference he has great chemistry with her. Dino has probably his best acting role here. Walter Brennan is always fun. The most surprising part of the cast is Ricky Nelson and how good he was alongside these more experienced actors. The cast works well together and there's a real sense that these people like each other that comes through in their performances, making it all the more believable.The plot is deceptively simple but it just goes to show that stories don't have to be complex to be interesting. It's a great character western, slow but well-paced. Howard Hawks shows why he is one of the all-time greats with how well he handles these characters and their actors, the flaws and strengths of each, and tells a simple but powerful story. The Furthman and Brackett script is great. I read some of the negative reviews here and all I can say is that I feel sorry for those people. Most of them seem to either have an ax to grind with Wayne and Hawks or they just don't like westerns to begin with. The good reputation of this film has lasted decades.

21,zardoz-13,"Not Quite As Legendary As It's Cracked Up To Be, But Definitely Worth Watching for Western Fans",9,17 December 2008,"""Red River"" director Howard Hawks and his leading man John Wayne made ""Rio Bravo"" (1959) as a rebuttal to ""From Here to Eternity"" director Fred Zinnemann's ""High Noon"" (1952) with Gary Cooper. Hawks and Wayne hated ""High Noon"" because veteran town marshal Will Kane (Gary Cooper) lost his nerve in a crisis when a quartet of hardcase gunslingers arrived in town to kill him. Kane's regular deputy quit on him and Kane resorted in desperation to citizen deputies to help him stop a revenge-driven villain that Kane had sent to prison. Hawks and Wayne contended that the professional ""High Noon"" lawman should have stood his ground alone. At the last minute, Will Kane's Quaker wife came to his rescue. Wayne didn't like the ending where Kane tossed his badge in the dust. Quoting the Wayne biography by Randy Roberts and James Olson, the Duke said, ""It's the most un-American thing I've ever seen in my whole life. The last thing in the picture is old Coop putting the United States marshal's badge under his foot and stepping on it."" Hawks puts his ""Rio Bravo"" protagonists in a similar crisis. Town sheriff John T. Chance (John Wayne) must confront an angry rancher and his army of trigger-happy gunmen after he arrests the rancher's younger brother for murdering an unarmed man during a saloon brawl. The primary theme of professionals versus amateurs pervaded Howard Hawks' movies and the highest tribute that any Hawksian hero or villain could pay to each another is that they were 'good' at their job. Unlike the weak-kneed ""High Noon"" hero, the heroic ""Rio Bravo"" lawman maintains his poise under pressure despite insuperable odds.After the disastrous box-office reception of his 1956 Biblical epic ""Land of the Pharaohs,"" Howard Hawks went into a self-imposed, four-year exile in Europe. Hawks made his comeback with ""Rio Bravo"" and assembled a stellar cast including Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, Walter Brennan and Angie Dickinson in a thoroughly ordinary but often suspenseful oater about a fearless lawman who has to hold a killer, Joe Burdette (Claude Atkins of ""Return of the Seven""), in jail until the deputy marshal shows up in six days to take him. Predictably, Nathan Burdette (John Russell of ""Unforgiven"") isn't about to let Chance turn his brother over to the sheriff. A recovering alcoholic deputy, Dude (Dean Martin in his first dramatic role), and an old, crippled jailer, Stumpy (Walter Brennan of ""Sergeant York""), stand alongside Chance. When one of Chance's loud-mouthed friends, Pat Wheeler (Ward Bond of ""The Searchers""), tries to convince citizens to help Chance, Burdette's men ambush him in the street. Dude wounds the killer in the foot and Chance and he track him into a saloon where the patrons say they saw nobody enter. Meanwhile, the Wheeler's killer stands in the rafter dripping blood into a whiskey glass and Dude spots the blood and guns the felon down. Wheeler's ex-bodyguard Colorado (teen singing sensation Ricky Nelson of ""The Ozzie & Harriet Show"") joins them after rescuing Chance in a street shoot-out. A lady gambler, Feathers (Angie Dickinson of ""China Gate""), complicates matters in a romantic subplot. Eventually, Burdette's gang abducts Dude and arranges an exchange for Joe. The resourceful heroes thwart Burdette's plans to free Joe and kill Dude in an explosive finale. The entire picture looks like a metaphor for the Cold War and specifically the eve of the Berlin airlift about the Soviets ""bottled up"" the Allies and let nothing get into the city.The critics and the public hailed ""Rio Bravo"" as a superlative western, and Hawks was back on top again. Later, Hawks recycled material from the Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett garrulous screenplay and made ""El Dorado"" (1966) and ""Rio Lobo"" (1970) with Wayne who finds himself in a similar predicament facing long odds. Despite its popular and critical reception at the time of its release, ""Rio Bravo"" is far from being a classic western. Hawks himself has said in interviews that he detested dull pictures where the heroes stood around and palavered. Essentially, for most of its indulgent 140 minutes, the sympathetic ""Rio Bravo"" heroes stand around a jabber with several comic interludes involving a Hispanic innkeeper Carlos (Pedro Gonzalez-Gonzalez) over peripheral matters. The subplot about Feathers is clearly material that Hawks used in his first Humphrey Bogart & Lauren Bacall thriller ""To Have and Have Not,"" but Wayne and Dickinson don't generate the same chemistry. The ""Rio Bravo"" heroes never seem like they are in jeopardy. They have time to argue and sing songs. Meanwhile, Burdette's bad guys lurk on the fringes. Aside from a miscast Ricky Nelson, who resembles Mickey Mouse with a pair of pistols, the cast qualifies as first-rate.""Rio Bravo"" boasts many entertaining scenes and the Furthman & Brackett screenplay does an admirable job of setting up situations at the outset that they pay off at the showdown. Apart from its title credits scene, ""Rio Bravo"" emerges as a claustrophobic western that confines itself to the environs of the town with no wide open spaces. Academy Award winning ""High Noon"" actor Gary Cooper wasn't impressed and called ""Rio Bravo"" phony. Nevertheless, this memorable Hawks movie has acquired a reputation among many genre aficionados as one of the top ten westerns. Ironically, although its title refers to the famous river the separates Texas from Mexico, none of the ""Rio Bravo"" action takes place anywhere near it. Incidentally, there are three close-ups in ""Rio Bravo."" The first one is Joe pulling his six-gun and firing it. The second is the blood dripping into the whiskey glass on the bar. The third is Dude's fingers trying to shape a cigarette out of tobacco and papers. ""Rio Bravo"" is a good western, but John Sturges' ""Last Train from Gun Hill"" with Kirk Douglas and Anthony Quinn tops it for drama, suspense, and action.",Rio Bravo
22,grantss,A Howard Hawks/John Wayne classic,8,22 March 2014,"A classic Howard Hawks/John Wayne western. Good plot, good action, solid performances. Better plot than most westerns. Some little things don't always make sense or gel, but there are no glaring plot holes. Don't just a shoot-em-up western, there is character development too, especially in the case of Dean Martin's character, and even some romance, though this is dealt with a touch superficially.Good action scenes, as you would expect from Howard Hawks and John Wayne.John Wayne is his usual cool, swaggering, albeit one-dimensional self. Probably the best performance comes from Dean Martin, as his character has the most depth, and demons.As if one singer in the cast wasn't enough, we have Ricky Nelson too. Wasn't expecting much from him, but he is fine in his role as the Colorado kid.Having Martin and Nelson in the movie means the producers are obliged to have a musical interlude. It is fairly gratuitous, but I didn't mind it. Good music, well played and sung.Angie Dickinson provides the love interest, and does so very well.Only blemishes are two of the supporting cast: Pedro Gonzalez-Gonzalez as Carlos and Walter Brennan as Stumpy. You'd swear Gonzalez-Gonzalez's performance inspired the character of Manuel in Fawlty Towers. So clumsy and stereotypical it is irritating. At least Manuel was funny.Walter Brennan's Stumpy talks far too much and complains far too much, about nothing. Very irritating. Hawks should have dialed him down a bit.

23,Boba_Fett1138,Well made but far from my favorite.,7,12 August 2011,"Perhaps it is because westerns aren't really my thing but I just never really could get into this movie. It's long, mostly consists out of just talking back and forth and is lacking in adventure, action, true excitement and than some more.Guess you could still say that the movie is good, just not great. Even though it was lacking a lot, it wasn't a movie that I hated watching, simply because it's a far too well made one for that. Howard Hawks and John Wayne are obviously at ease within the genre, I just wished that the story had more to offer.It takes literally almost 90 minutes into this movie for the 'conflict' to finally develop but that doesn't mean that the movie takes off after that point. It's one that more puts its focus on its characters, rather than its story. That's fine of course, as long as the characters are interesting enough and the actors that play them are good in their roles. But no, John Wayne wasn't exactly the best actor that ever lived, which also shows in this movie and Ricky Nelson was also distractingly poor in his role. What the movie is further more lacking, when it comes down to its characters, is a good strong villain. Of course they still found room for a love-story to get thrown in, which just isn't something I'm waiting for when I'm going to see a western. It still is good and fun to see a young Angie Dickinson in this, as Wayne's, almost 30 years younger, love interest.Because the characters aren't really that compelling, the dialog of the movie also falls sort of flat. And the dialog is really something the movie its script had put its emphasis on. This is the foremost reason why the movie tends to feel a bit overlong and slow. I kept waiting for a good stand off or the moment that they got on their horses and ride off but it just wasn't that kind of western. So yes, maybe I was expecting a different movie but I was also certainly expecting a better one.Sorry to say but this movie just never surpassed the level of 'just good' for me.7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Rio Bravo
24,oscaralbert,No matter how many Bogart\Bacall lines are recycled here . . .,6,30 December 2015,". . . this three-hour snooze-fest (or chick flick) is no HIGH NOON. Which is not a surprise, since nearly all the cast and crew involved here in RIO BRAVO were REAL CRAVO witch-hunting bullies or their cowardly craven enablers, and NOT right-thinking Americans such as Gary Cooper's U.S. Constitution-loving really brave sheriff in HIGH NOON. John Wayne's RIO BRAVO character is once again named ""John,"" probably because ""Il Duce"" had a few too many grid-iron concussions at Southern Cal. This gave him more trouble remembering to answer to a third name (layered on top of his childhood handle ""Marion"" and his studio flunky tag ""John"") than any other actor in cinema history. Why else are there nearly 100 movie credits in Mr. Wayne's IMDb filmography where his characters are named either ""John"" or ""Hey, you!""? Though ""Feathers"" (teenager Angie Dickinson) parrots teen Lauren Bacall after kissing John a second time on-screen here (""It's better when TWO people do it""), RIO BRAVO cannot even rise to the level of second-rate Bogart, such as the lame TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT flick in which director Howard Hawks goes on his scavenger's hunt. (And Ms. Dickinson was too sharp to follow Ms. Bacall's Real Life lead in breaking up a Real Life marriage and saddling herself with a geezer for the rest of his Real Life, despite Mr. Hawks attempts to play a Real Life Cupid again.) John, as ""John,"" references THE ALAMO here, a mendacious vanity project then in the planning stages that would temporarily bankrupt Il Duce a few years after RIO BRAVO was released. When talking about RIO BRAVO composer Dimitri Tiomkin's fake version of the Mexican Army's ""No quarter"" Deguello dirge foreshadowing the eventual fate of Texas Race War Terrorists Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie, William Travis, and their ilk, the RIO BRAVO characters never explain that the reason for the heroic Mexican Freedom Fighters taking such an understandable dislike to the self-proclaimed ""Texicans"" was that the latter bunch of lazy racists were Hell-bent upon Re-enslaving all of the Free Black People of Mexico's Texas Province!",Rio Bravo
25,Wuchakk,Town-confined Western focuses on the likable main characters,6,12 March 2014,"One professional critic referred to Howard Hawks' ""Rio Bravo"" as a ""super Western."" Released in 1959, John Wayne plays Sheriff John T. Chance of Rio Bravo with three deputies: Dude (Dean Martin), who struggles with alcoholism the whole story, the cackling Stumpy (Walter Brennan) and, later, the youthful Colorado (Ricky Nelson). They try to stave off a rich rancher (John Russell) and his hired heavies who are intent on freeing the rancher's murderous brother from jail (Claude Akins). Angie Dickinson plays Feathers, a gambling saloon girl who develops a things for the Sheriff.""Rio Bravo"" was Hawks & Wayne's response to ""High Noon"", the popular Western released 7 years earlier. They rejected the cowardly depiction of a town of Westerners toward 4 outlaws out to kill the ex-Sheriff. It's hard to believe that any townspeople in the real Old West would have turned yella when faced with just 4 gunmen. These were tough folks, after all, who had faced Indians, wild animals, bad weather etc. to get to the West and were as familiar with guns as we are with cell phones. Many were Civil War veterans.A good example is the James-Younger gang, who were shot to ribbons in Northfield, Minnesota, when the townspeople got word that their bank was being robbed. Same thing happened to the Dalton Gang in Coffeyville Kansas. Both of these gangs were far larger than the 4 gunmen of ""High Noon."" Since banks were not insured by the FDIC in those days, depositors were very nervous about unauthorized ""withdrawals"" by outlaw scum.Is ""Rio Bravo"" really a ""Super-Western,"" as that aforementioned critic called it? No. A classic perhaps, but certainly not a ""Super-Western."" It struck me as a Western soap opera more than anything else, which isn't a bad thing, as I enjoy dramas now and then, but this is hardly an action-packed Western. There are four confrontations/gunfights in the first two hours before the final showdown; other than that it's all soap operatics. Which, again, isn't necessarily a bad thing; I just think it's important for potential viewers to realize that ""Rio Bravo"" is not an action film. It's a dialogue-driven drama with a few gunfights.""Rio Bravo"" was shot in Old Tuscon, Arizona, and the studios of Burbank. Despite the former this is a fairly studio-bound Western, but it does successfully create the world of Rio Bravo where the viewer spends 2 hours and 21 minutes. ""Rio Bravo"" has a unique vibe. It's almost weird, like you're entering into this surreal Old West world, which I guess explains its cult status. Since the film has a strange ambiance it helps if you mentally prepare to watch it. It also helps to use the subtitles so you can keep track of the interminable discourses since this is such a dialogue-driven picture. For instance, the first time I watched ""Rio Bravo"" (in the early 2000s) I failed to fully appreciate it because I missed a lot of the talk. Using the subtitles really helped me appreciate the movie more.Hawks made two other Westerns with Wayne that bear similarities to ""Rio Bravo"" -- ""El Dorado"" in 1967 and ""Rio Lobo"" in 1970 -- but these are far from remakes, as some claim, especially the latter (only the second half of ""El Dorado"" takes the ""Rio Bravo"" route). They're all of about the same quality so, whether you prefer one or the other depends on what you want. I like ""El Dorado"" best, followed by maybe ""Rio Lobo,"" perhaps because they're less dated and far less soap opera-ee. Yet I've come to appreciate ""Rio Bravo.""Angie Dickinson is a highlight. She was 28 during filming and beautiful, particularly in her stunning closing scenes, but you have to wait well over two hours to get there. One critic panned the romantic subplot between Feathers and Chance, but I found it compelling in a low-key, heartwarming way. If anything was going to be cut to shorten the runtime it should be the song sequence at the Sheriff's office with Martin and Nelson, but it has its old-fashioned charm, so I'm glad it's there. Speaking of music, the ""El Degüello"" piece by Dimitri Tiomkin is outstanding. FINAL WORD: If you brace yourself for entering the unique world of ""Rio Bravo"" this is a solid character-driven 50's Western characterized by the camaraderie of the protagonists and grace under pressure. It's largely an Old West drama limited to the confines of the town of Rio Bravo, i.e. Old Tucson (I guess that's why they called it ""Rio Bravo"", huh?).GRADE: B-",Rio Bravo

Helping out our hero is a sobering-up deputy (Dean Martin), an old cripple (Walter Brennan) and an eager young gunfighter (Rick Nelson). Angie Dickinson is also hanging around to get under Wayne's skin and look gorgeous for the camera.It's an epic revenge oater with lenty of buildup and a legendary shootout to cap things off.

I do not agree with many who reckon that Ricky Nelson does not pull his weight. As far as I am concerned, he plays the young and talented gunslinger who aspires to achieve what the seniors around him have, exactly right, partially because he is young and talented and learning from his fellow actors. Angie Dickinson is another who comes in for criticism but although her performance is not a particularly confident one, again it fits the role she has to play in competing with the guys and flirting with the big man. John Wayne brings a legendary back story all his own and if he seems at times to be coasting, why should he not? Completely in control, he is ably assisted by a fantastic performance from Dean Martin and a very likable one from Walter Brennan.

30,JamesHitchcock,"Howard Hawks could perhaps have learned something from ""High Noon""",7,16 October 2007,"""Rio Bravo"" is sometimes described as a right-wing riposte to Fred Zinnemann's ""High Noon"". I am not sure why ""High Noon"" needed a right-wing riposte, because it has never seemed to me to be particularly left-wing. On a literal level it deals with a subject- the need for a strong stance on law and order- which has always been dear to the hearts of conservatives, and on a metaphorical level it would be just as easy to read a right-wing meaning into it as it would a left-wing one. (Given that the film was made during the Korean War, it would be easy to see Sheriff Kane as a symbol of America as the world's policeman, Frank Miller and his gang as Stalin, Mao and the other Communist leaders and the cowardly townspeople as the anti-war movement in the West). The received idea that the film is an allegory for McCarthyism has always struck me as a strained interpretation.It would appear, however, that what angered Howard Hawks and John Wayne about ""High Noon"" was not so much Zinnemann's views on McCarthyism but rather his implication that the citizens of Hadleyville are cowards for refusing to help Kane. This seems to have inspired the most direct reference to the earlier film in ""Rio Bravo"". When it is suggested to John Wayne's Sheriff John T. Chance that he should round up a posse, he replies that asking amateurs to help him fight hardened professional gunmen would only give the villains more targets to shoot at. The inference is that Gary Cooper's character was wrong to ask the townsfolk to risk their lives on his behalf.The two films are, in fact, broadly similar in plot. Both concern a courageous and incorruptible Sheriff taking on a gang of dangerous villains who are threatening the peace of a whole community. (This basic plot was used in numerous other Westerns, such as ""Dodge City"" and ""Gunfight at the OK Corral""). In ""Rio Bravo"" Chance has arrested a local hoodlum named Joe Burdette on suspicion of murder. Burdette's brother Nathan, a wealthy rancher, organises a gang of gunfighters to try and free him from the jail. Chance has to try and hold off the thugs for several days until the US Marshal arrives to take Joe to stand trial.His chances of doing so, however, seem slim, because his only assistance comes from his deputies, one of whom, Dude, is an alcoholic and the other, Stumpy, is a one-legged old man. (Was Dude the inspiration for Gene Wilder's character in ""Blazing Saddles""?) Dude and Stumpy, however, find reserves of courage within themselves, and Chance recruits another volunteer, a young gunman named Colorado who has seen his boss murdered by the villains. ""Rio Bravo"", in fact, is not simply an action film, but also a character study. One of its themes is the way in which the characters battle to overcome their problems- Stumpy's disability, Dude's alcoholism and, in Colorado's case, his initial moral cowardice and reluctance to assist.Colorado is played by Ricky Nelson, a teenage pop star of the period, who was brought in to try and attract a younger audience. He was, however, only seventeen when filming started, and seems far too young and callow for the role. If Chance was so concerned about avoiding innocent casualties, he would no doubt have sent such an inexperienced greenhorn back home to mother before the shooting started. Walter Brennan's Stumpy can seem a bit irritating, but with those exceptions the acting is mostly good. I am of the generation which always thinks of Angie Dickinson as the sexy older woman in ""Police Woman"", so this film gave me the opportunity to see what she looked like as a sexy younger woman. (Very nice too). Chance is the sort of role which John Wayne excelled in portraying, but the best performance came from Dean Martin as Dude, a man who finds redemption for his past misdeeds. There is also a good cameo from John Wayne's close friend Ward Bond as Pat Wheeler, Colorado's murdered boss.The main difference between this film and ""High Noon"" is not one of politics but of style. ""High Noon"" is shot in real time and conveys an urgent sense of time rushing towards the final showdown; it also observes the Classical unity of action as well as that of time, with no digressions from the main plot. ""Rio Bravo is much more leisurely and spacious, running to nearly 2½ hours. Besides the main action there is also a subplot detailing Chance's burgeoning romance with Dickinson's character, a female card-sharp and good-time girl named Feathers, and plenty of comic relief involving Carlos the Mexican barman (who closely resembles Manuel in ""Fawlty Towers"") and even Stumpy, who for all his bravery is often treated as a comic character. Of the two films, my preference is definitely for ""High Noon"". ""Rio Bravo"" never drags, as there is always something going on to hold one's interest, but it lacks the gripping pacing which makes ""High Noon"" one of the most thrilling films ever made. (In my view it is perhaps the greatest Western ever). Hawks may have disagreed with Zinnemann over politics, but he could perhaps have learned something from him about film-making. 7/10",Rio Bravo

Robert Mitchum has Dean Martins role & James Caan in the Ricky Nelson role. The pleasure of seeing this is in the fact that a very good cast & very good director make a good solid film. Hawks directed the remake too.",Rio Bravo

35,Lejink,Bravo Bravo!,8,15 August 2011,"One of the best westerns I've seen, directed by the great Howard Hawks on his return to Hollywood after a four year gap. I frankly didn't fancy the cast-list here as I'm no great admirer of John Wayne and didn't think Dean Martin capable of acting straight, but they unquestionably gell, with the glue of old-timer Walter Huston binding them together. I read with interest the IMDb trivia section for this movie and noted that it was posited by Hawks and Wayne as an alternative take on the plot of ""High Noon"", as ageing sheriff Wayne marshals his sparse and motley crew of drunkard Martin, invalid Huston and bright-eyed kid, then current pop-star Ricky Nelson (I wonder how first preference Elvis would have worked) in trying to detain the murderous brother of the corrupting Mr Big of the town, Burdette, who it seems can buy everyone else in the town to his side, bar Wayne's team, the latter assisted by visiting show-girl-cum-gambler Angie Dickinson, and a husband and wife Spanish hotelier. The film grips from the start as we're introduced to Martin's desperate drunk and soon after Wayne's archetypal commanding, incorruptible authority figure. The story unfolds naturally, always involving the viewer until it reaches its literally explosive climax, but takes in along the way an unlikely-seeming romance between the young and spirited Dickinson and the old curmudgeon Wayne and Martin's own battle against the bottle and for his own self-respect. Old Huston delivers most of the humour with his bickering and prattling but Ricky Nelson is completely out of his depth here as young gunslinger Colorado, at times seeming positively star-struck between Wayne and Martin. No matter, even his wooden acting, plus Dickinson's over-accented playing, can't detract from the excellence of the other three. I could also have done without the musical interlude, obviously a sop to Nelson's teenage followers and perhaps the baddies could have been painted a bit blacker, but this was still an enthralling yarn, masterfully helmed by one of the greatest of all directors.",Rio Bravo
36,secondtake,"A Western that defines its type, one of the best, a match to El Dorado",9,30 January 2013,"Rio Bravo (1959)I saw this again because I just saw (and loved) the similar Howard Hawks movie, ""El Dorado."" This earlier one is more famous and revered, and I can see why at first. ""Rio Bravo"" is archetypal. It's more serious and a little more gritty and violent than the later one. It's also extremely well done, a kind of paradigm for the good guy/bad guy Western. There are some humanizing factors here for this type of movie. John Wayne is his usual likable stern self but with a sense of humor. Dean Martin plays a (dirty) drunk in a way you can empathize with. And Ricky Nelson is mild and cute (and sort of dispensable). And then there is Angie Dickinson who has a kind of sculptural presence and comes off with pretty good ease as a young actress (she was a television actress all along, and later was a t.v. icon in ""Police Woman,"" a middling cop show in the 1970s). This movie is partly about relationships--friendships, budding romance, rivalries. And the overriding theme is one of sticking together against evil. The town is ""good"" and all of Sheriff John Wayne's friends are ""good."" I put it in quotes because they represent good, as opposed to evil. Or at least to indifference, which is a deliberate counterpoint to Zinnemann's famous ""High Noon"" where the town will not help the sheriff. (John Wayne was angry about High Noon and wanted to do Rio Bravo partly to set the record straight about how decent people really will rise to help their sheriff in dire times.)The result is a surprisingly feel-good experience. The movie has its dark moments, but you learn quickly that our gang of good people (including, by the way, a cackling Walter Brennan) will prevail. So encounters might lose their chill and sinister edge, but they gain the power of winning. Maybe this is like Bruce Willis in the Die Hard movies, where you know, in his joking way, he'll succeed. So these jokers, who really like each other and who even take time to sing a couple songs as a group (John Wayne just watches), succeed.So is this a great movie? Yes, pretty much living up to its reputation. It is almost a final punctuation mark on two decades of Westerns (if we look at 1939 as the start, when four major A-list Westerns hit the screens after a terrible decade of trashy B-list versions). It sets the stage for the arch exaggerations like ""Fistful of Dollars"" and other Italian productions. And it sets the stage of Hawks's own ""remake"" of sorts, ""El Dorado."" And for my money, I like the way El Dorado pushes the ideas a little harder--both into a kind of campy humor and into a true buddy relationship between the leads in that film. Here Dean Martin is always marginalized, even as he pulls of some life-saving feats.See them both. Check out the idea. Throw in High Noon and you'll have an idea of how the American Western was winding up some very prolific and profitable years.",Rio Bravo
37,vincentlynch-moonoi,Outstanding Western in so many ways,9,19 January 2016,"The number of Westerns that Hollywood has made is mind boggling. I hate to think how many there have been. And, Westerns have suffered because of that. Just about everything you could do in a Western has been done over and over again, of course with variations, but I guess you could say that there's nothing new under the desert sun.So, to be considered one of the very best Westerns ever made is quite a compliment. But what is it that makes this Western truly special. There's nothing new here. Just about every thing in this film had been done in some other Western. But here, all those various elements come together in one film. The sheriff in trouble; nothing new. A boozy cowboy; nothing new. A hot shot young gunfighter' nothing new. A Gabby Hayes like sidekick; certainly nothing new. A seemingly floozy woman gambler; nothing new. A bully who thinks he can control everything and everyone; nothing new. A bully; nothing new. A shootout; nothing new. Ac crusader; nothing new there. And, most importantly, the camaraderie; nothing new there, either. Most Westerns are lucky to have a few such elements, but in ""Rio Bravo"", all those elements and many others come together perfectly.The opening scenes of the film are considered by many to be brilliant. NO DIALOG as the drunk (Dean Martin) walks into a saloon, and is seemingly offered a drink by the bully (Claude Akins), who throws a coin into a spittoon. The drunk is beginning to reach into the spittoon when it is kicked away by a towering man (John Wayne). The drunk reacts by clobbering the sheriff with a piece of firewood. The bully laughs, and is in turn attacked by the drunk. The drunk is beaten. A bystander steps in and is hot to death. The bleeding sheriff follows the bully to another saloon. Nearly 4 minutes later, finally some dialog. But that opening sequence sets the stage (so to speak) for all that is to come.A second brilliant set of scenes takes place again in a saloon after Ward Bond's character is shot to death. The assassin apparently runs into the saloon, but then disappears. Dude (Dean) wants to go in the front door for a change, so Change (Wayne) goes in the back. But no bad guy. Dude orders a drink, and then just a few drops of blood drips down from the loft above into a mug of beer. Absolutely fantastic scene.When it comes right down to it, the pivotal character in this film is Dude, played by Dean Martin. Almost everything in the film revolves around the drunk's redemption. Even Wayne once noted it. Dean's character here, however, isn't just a drunk. He coming off of a drunk and having withdrawal symptoms. A commendable performance, and an indication of what Dean was capable of...when he summoned up his ambition to really act.Another strength here is a strong supporting cast. Ricky Nelson does quite well in a very laid-back role as a sharpshooter. Angie Dickinson -- never one of my favorites -- does nicely here as slightly disreputable woman who ends up with...well, you know. And, by the way, John Wayne was often rather clumsy in romantic scenes, but here he plays well off of Angie Dickinson. And of course, special commendation to Walter Brennan -- always great -- for one of his very best film performances. And there's also Ward Bond, a character actor that I have always felt was highly underrated. For comic relief there's Pedro Gonzalez-Gonzalez as the hotel keeper. Gonzalez-Gonzalez made an interesting splash in show business about this time -- first noticed for a visit to Groucho Marx's ""You Bet Your Life"".Some have made much about the ""singing segment"". As illogical as it is, it works. Dean's performance of ""My Rifle, My Pony, And Me"" is one of Dean's finest vocal performances. And, it advances the story.Of course, there's got to be real shootout, and the shoot out in ""Rio Bravo"" is a humdinger and rather unique. Dude is kidnapped after a foiled jailbreak, add in dynamite at an old warehouse, mix in Wayne, Deal, and Nelson, and you've the recipe for an explosive...yet fun...conclusion. And then there's the concluding scene..,implying that Wayne and Feathers are having sex...but it's done in a clever and humorous way.A perfect picture? Well, no, but then again how many films are...probably none. I can't find anything here to criticize, but lots to praise.Well, actually I do have one criticism, but it's not about the film. It's about the Blu-Ray disc from Warner Brothers. It's not up to what we have come to expect from Blu-Ray. That's not to say it's a bad print, but it's also not top-notch.",Rio Bravo
38,redryan64,"RIO BRAVO, The Horse Opera with Something for Just About Ever'body!!",8,30 July 2007,"This is a good example of viewing a film 'then' and 'now'. RIO BRAVO was a big movie with the Saturday Matinée crowd in its original release, in 1959. Every kid in the neighborhood saw it. We loved it. But what about years later, being 60 rather than 13. How does it hold up? Just what went into creating a picture with such wide appeal? Take the grizzled,old veteran Westerner, the 'Duke', himself. Cast him as the solo Lawman, facing a tough battle in a Town that's a veritable Powder Keg, just ready to 'splode real good! Now, we add a Big Time, Big Ranch Owner and Wealthy No Goodnik, Nathan Burdette(John Russell). Let Burdette's less 'urbane', but just as nasty brother, Joe Burdette.Let's have everybody's favourtie TV Grandfather, old Amos McCoy*, himself, Walter Brennan as that lovable, old coot of a Deputy/Comic Relief, ""Stumpy"". After all, a town needs a deputy to stay in the office and be the ""Offical Town Jailer."" Being the Old West, an awful lot of the action would have to take place in a Saloon. A Saloon means Beer, Whiskey and drunken hands. It also nurtures a steady succession of Poker, even more than we have on Cable TV nowadays. The Gambling draws a lot of professional gamblers, and a steady supply of those Ladies with bad reputations. You know, the type you date, but never marry. So, along comes lovely, leggy ""Feathers""(Angie Dickinson). She has a bad reputation that is undeserved. She has to live it down.Now RIO BRAVO, unlike most Westerns, has not just one,but two (2) singers. We have Crooner Dean Martin as 'Dude', a has been Deputy trying to get back his confidence and respect. Teen Idol, Rick Nelson is young gunslinger/cattle drover, turned Deputy, 'Colorado' Ryan.Ward Bond (Major Adams on WAGON TRAIN) plays a trail boss, just passing through town, but he is not afraid to help old friend,Sherioff John T. Chance (the Duke), no matter what. Pedro Gonzalez-Gonzalez gives a serio-comic performance as the Mexican Hotel Keeper.** All levity aside, the film involves a killing by Joe Burdette (Claude Aikins)and the job of maintaining the safety of the town against the seemingly endless number of hired guns that brother Nathan (John Russell) would keep running at them.The Fim has some spectacular action scenes. The Logistical Problems of staging Pitched Gun Battles and the accompanying Equinne Choreography involved are well executed and even fresh.There are some very comical scenes as well as some highly dramatic ones. One very touching scene near the beginning of the film involves Dean Martin, Claude Aikins and a 'Cartwheel'(Silver Dollar). It really helped to both give a background as well as to set the serious, sympathetic tone of the main story line.At 141 minutes, it seems to go on and on and on. After all, we had been conditioned to the hour and half-hour TV series format, complete with commercial time, for trips to the kybo and the refrigerator.When viewed recently, we found it to be a little long, yes. But the extra time is used to amplify and strengthen the story.It was not just padding for padding's sake.It seems that a lot of film critics and writers seem to agree. For you see, this RIO BRAVO is now seen as a prime example of the Western Film at its best.. * Walter Brenman was Grandpappy Amos McCoy on the ABC Sitcom, ""THE REAL McCOYS""(1957-59). He starred in 2 other series, THE TYCOON(1964-65) and THER GUNS OF WILL SONNETT(1967-69). ** Having done some local radio work in Texas, Pedro Gonzalez-Gonzalez was discovered as a contestant on Groucho Marx's NBC TV YOU BET YOUR LIFE.

Brief Review -John Wayne and Western, a deadly Combo which never failed. Here's Another Classic! John Wayne Fan Clubs might have put a bio in their social media profiles if available in those days saying, ""John Wayne in Western, Nobody does it better"". Rio Bravo is a solid proof that how simple yet excellent a western drama could be with no further intentional implications and efforts. It's just so fine without any mess, twist and thrill. A small-town sheriff in the American West enlists the help of a cripple, a drunk, and a young gunfighter in his efforts to hold in jail the brother of the local bad guy. An ordinary looking script on paper is built by extraordinary vision of director Howard Hawks. Not to forget he's the same man who had several classics in Comedy, Thriller, Noir genres and yet he grabbed the core of western genre much before we saw universal classics in the same genre. Rio Bravo has engaging screenplay and tight orders of all sequences that can be enjoyed in repeat viewing too. It has good comedy too, such a rare thing in dark Western genre. The background score is designed perfectly to help the scenes look more impactful. I kind of like so many things about this film that i even forget to mention some, nevertheless, i would go on with the mandatory ones. John Wayne delivers yet another remarkable performance as Sheriff. Like i said, nobody does it better than him when it comes to perfection in the characters for Western dramas. Rio Bravo is yet another feather on his hat that will shine with Colours forever. Angie Dickinson looks hot, Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson were good too but a real surprise was Walter Brennan. What an amazing act it was. What a great dialogue delivery and accent he had, Terrific. Overall, an evergreen Classic Western Drama by Wayne-Hawks pair.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",Rio Bravo

46,funkyfry,One of the all-time great Westerns,10,22 January 2007,"For me this movie glistens with the reflected magic of movies. It might not be a Western to everyone's liking because it isn't strictly speaking ""realistic"" in every aspect, but it presents basically a complete package of entertainment with action, comedy, characterization, and even singing.The story is a pretty simple affair, with John T. Chance (John Wayne) arresting a murderer (Claude Akins) whose brother (John Russell) happens to be a big wheel in this frontier town. As he sits and waits for the Federal Marshall to appear to take the murderer away, everyone in town offers their help but he doesn't want any (""we'd just be giving them more targets to shoot at""), in a reversal of ""High Noon"". His only companions early on are an ""old cripple"" (Walter Brennan) and his recovering alcoholic friend ""Dude"" (Dean Martin). After Chance's friend Pat (Ward Bond) is killed by the brother's hired killers, they are joined by Pat's friend who they name ""Colorado"" (Ricky Nelson). Then he begins to fall for a lady of somewhat questionable repute, a possible criminal gambler who he names ""Feathers"" (Angie Dickinson). The nicknames are typical of the movie's excellent style of characterization and also its macho aesthetic -- which interestingly is extended to the very aggressive woman Feathers.One of the film's better aspects is the way in which it avoids overt symbolism, allegory, and is generally speaking anti-epic in its style and goals. The movie isn't about ""how the West was won"" or ""how the West was lost"" or any other such topic.... it's really more of a war/combat story about how men are able to rise above their problems by staying true to each others' friendship and by respecting each other even to the point where you would hurt your friend in order to tell him the truth.The film's style of characterization is not subtle, but it is effective. The very first scene is a good example -- Dude walks into the bar where Burdette (Akins) and his friends are carousing and the camera lingers on the liquor bottle while we see Dude smacking his lips. Burdette laughs and tosses a coin into the spittoon, and Dude begins to fish the coin out of the filthy tobacco receptacle but is interrupted by Chance, who the camera did not observe entering the room. This scene lets us know that Dude is an alcoholic and that Chance cares about him, while others mock him. All of these elements are important throughout the film.I'm very impressed with the way the romance between Chance and Feathers was worked out. It bears comparison to another Brackett/Furthman screenplay, ""To Have and Have Not"". But it's even more amped up here, with Feathers for instance insisting on a strip search while the embarrassed Sheriff Chance hems and haws. This is really the only film I've seen where Wayne was used convincingly as a lover. The screenwriters and Hawks deserve only part of the credit -- I would credit Wayne for being willing to underplay and let Angie steal a lot of scenes, and certainly Dickinson shows the kind of fire that makes you wonder why she didn't become a huge star. This is one of the best aspects of the film.All the supporting cast is excellent as well. Martin really surprises for anyone who is only acquainted with his comedy work -- he does a good job of showing both his torture and self-loathing and the gradual path to self-respect. Brennan, always a delight, is here especially fun as a sort of Gabby Hayes-esquire malcontent coot. Nelson is perhaps the weakest of the 3 principals but he doesn't look completely bad, just a bit too smooth and casual compared to the amped up performances given by the others.Not to be missed by fans of classic movies.",Rio Bravo
47,jzappa,"Fighting, Shooting, Singing, Talking, Sitting",8,18 March 2009,"This highly lauded 1959 western contains an intimate clique of haywire individuals who secure their reparation through group effort and brushing off exclusive self-sufficiency. The nixing of real names and the clannish custom of nicknames like Chance, Dude, Colorado and Stumpy by this humble troupe of losers and odd men out epitomizes a formation of cumulative self-coinage, which is imperative for them, into an able and firmly self-reliant regiment of heroism, a demonstration of the men's longing to embody gingerly makeshift mock-mythic whimsical story lines for their lives.Supposedly, this gunslinger ballad was made as a comeback against High Noon, which is often seen to be an parable aimed at the Hollywood blacklist, a criticism of McCarthyism. Wayne approached director Howard Hawks to tell the story his way. Wayne was a conservative and an unyielding partisan of blacklisting. He felt insulted by Fred Zinnemann's classic western. So in Rio Bravo, his character is encircled by allies such as deputy Dean Martin recovering from alcoholism, young gunfighter Ricky Nelson, ranting and raving old man Walter Brennan, Mexican innkeeper Pedro Gonzalez Gonzalez, and Angie Dickinson, and again and again rejects help from anyone he doesn't think is fit to help him, yet in the climactic showdown they come to help him anyhow. All this supposed subtext I find extremely annoying, but all the same, I feel comfortable enough watching a John Wayne film like Rio Bravo, because unlike John Ford, who was so vain he might've taken his own hand in marriage, notoriously clever Howard Hawks avoids the era's often extreme religious ardor, schmaltz, flag-waving populism and maudlin mushiness. Fortunately, I don't feel that Wayne's intentions resonate.The opening scene, with positively no dialogue, is a testament to flexibility of the prolific director, famous for his gabby, street-survivalist classics like His Girl Friday, To Have and Have Not and The Big Sleep for instance. Rio Bravo is nevertheless more talk than action, which is part of its charm, but Hawks fashions a cliquish succession of compositions and dismisses all but two close-ups. In the opening, Dino's town drunk, enters a saloon wanting a drink. Joe Burdette, seeing Dude eying his glass, throws a silver dollar into a spittoon to mock him. Just as Dude goes for the spittoon, John Wayne's Tough Interceder protagonist Sheriff John T. Chance kicks the spittoon away, judgmentally looking at Dude with dejection and repugnance. As Chance turns to face Joe Burdette, Dude snatches up a piece of wood and clubs Chance on the head, knocking him out. Dude then starts toward Burdette, but two of his hired cowboys seize Dude and Burdette starts to beat him up. An onlooker grasps Burdette's arm so he can't swing on Dude again. Burdette draws his gun and shoots the bystander. The close-up of Joe's revolver firing is the first of the two close-ups. Burdette then leaves the saloon and sets out for another one seeming to have already forgotten about the ugly scenario.Rio Bravo is the kind of film that wants the audience to relax for its pleasantries. It's a male bonding picture with comic reliefs, heartthrobs, tough guys and even cool cats. It's about the things that we don't normally see in westerns, which are usually bone-dry parables, for better or worse, with a very impersonal edge. The music here is a big part of the film's lounging effect. Because it starred a crooner, Martin, and a teen idol, Nelson, Hawks includes three performances by them. Martin sings My Rifle, My Pony, and Me accompanied by Nelson, after which Nelson sings a brief version of Get Along Home, Cindy, accompanied by Martin and Brennan. God forbid Wayne sing, what with his masculinity complex and all. As a foil to these quasi musical numbers, the musical score itself by Dimitri Tiomkin includes El Degüello, a nostalgic air which is played several times to layer suspense. Nelson recognizes the melody and tells the song's history.The Texas town in which the film is set is hardly anything but a soundstage as our band of brothers fortifies themselves. It is in the jailhouse and the Mexican-run inn that the movie plunges, where Sheriff Chance determines that he nurture a family of friends, a small network on whom he can rely for both affection (exclusively Dickinson) and support (everybody else except Dickinson). We begin to enjoy seeing such moments as when Dino and Brennan share a laugh that when they encounter Joe Burdette and his minions again, the tension is already perceived by us, the audience, because the camaraderie of the good guys makes us abhor the idea of any of them getting shot. There are long intervals, but nonetheless Hawks manifests his urge for consistent inspiration at the hub of excitement, whether it be fighting, shooting, singing, talking or sitting.",Rio Bravo

The whole story takes place within the town, which I believe was unnamed and involves yet another variation of the ""High Noon"" theme of one man against the villains.John T. Chance (Wayne) is the sheriff of a small town. He has as his deputy a cantankerous, toothless and partially crippled old timer named Stumpy (Walter Brennan). His former deputy Dude, has become the town drunk following a failed love affair.The town and surrounding area is controlled by a powerful rancher named Nathan Burdette (John Russell). One day his brother Joe (Claude Atkins) guns down an unarmed man and is arrested by Chance. Chance plans on keeping Joe in jail until a federal marshal arrives some days later.Meanwhile Chance's friend, Pat Wheeler (Ward Bond) arrives in town with his wagon train and offers his assistance. Burdette learns of this and has Wheeler murdered. Dude joins in the hunt for Wheeler's killer. When the killer is taken, Dude decides to re-join Chance as his deputy.Meanwhile, a lady gambler known only as ""Feathers"" (Angie Dickenson) arrives in town and a relationship gradually develops between her and Chance. An attempt is made by Burdette's men to goad Chance into a gunfight but they are thwarted through the efforts of Wheeler's friend ""Colorado"" (Ricky Nelson) and Feathers, who come to the aid of the beleaguered sheriff.With Dude and Colorado now helping out, Chance awaits the final showdown with Burdette until.......The early scenes between Wayne and Dickenson are reminiscent of the May/September romance of Bogey and Bacall in Hawks' ""To Have and To Have Not"" (1944). Hawks was not above re-using old material. In fact ""Eldorado"" (1966) is a virtual re-make of ""Rio Bravo"" again with Wayne as the sheriff, Robert Mitchum in the Dean Martin role and James Caan in the Ricky Nelson part.Also in the cast are Pedro Gonzolez-Gonzolez and Estelita Rodriguez as Carlos and Consuela the hotel proprietors and western veterans Bob Steele, Myron Healey, Yakima Canutt, Riley Hill, Chuck Roberson (who was also Wayne's stunt double) and Eugene Iglesias play a variety of small roles. Harry Carey Jr. is listed in the cast but his scenes were evidently cut.A great western.",Rio Bravo

Everything about Rio Bravo was tired-tired-tired, including the 52 year-old John Wayne, who looked like he was about ready to nod off at any minute in this one.At 140 l-o-n-g minutes, I must say that Rio Bravo definitely pushed the limits when testing one's overall patience and tolerance. I believe that at least 30 minutes could've easily been cut from Rio Bravo's running time and no one would've noticed the diff, one way, or the other.Considering the so-called ""star-power"" that was jam-packed into Rio Bravo, you'd honestly think that this film would've just snapped, crackled, and popped with pure ""Western""-style vitality and vibrancy. But, no, sadly enough, Rio Bravo was so tired and slow-paced that, at times, it got mighty close to falling flat on its face.The unusual thing about Rio Bravo was that (since 95% of its action took place indoors) it lacked an authentic, Western-type, outdoor adventure to hold the viewer's interest. This struck me as very odd and this was the main factor that contributed to Rio Bravo's tired and somewhat claustrophobic atmosphere.Naturally with Rio Bravo being the tired Western production that it was, it could only be expected to feature a tired romance, as well. Right? This tediously tiresome love affair took place between 2 people who were, quite obviously, 30 years apart in age. And because there was no on-screen chemistry, whatsoever, happening between these 2 actors (Wayne & Dickinson), the whole affair was just plain tired to the 10th power, going, pretty much, nowhere, fast.Rio Bravo's highlight (if you really wanna call it that) was the duet of sorts that was sung between Pop Idol, Ricky Nelson and Swooner-Crooner, Dean Martin. Needless to say, this particular rendition of the ballad ""My Rifle, My Bow and Me"", which was effortlessly sung by these 2 singers was very much like the rest of Rio Bravo - T-I-R-E-D!Zzzzzzzzzzzzz.... What more can I say!?",Rio Bravo

Though the DVD bonus feature I'm actually reviewing (and rating 9 of 10 here)--THE JOHN WAYNE STOCK COMPANY: WARD BOND--actually appears on the 2005 Paramount HONDO release (another of the 23 movies, like RIO BRAVO, featuring BOTH Wayne and Bond), it makes more sense to talk about it on the RIO BRAVO page (since neither Paramount, IMDb, or the Wayne and Bond families cared enough about Ward Bond fans to acknowledge the existence of this 10 minute documentary short). Bond was in 250 movies (a number his drinking buddy Wayne often conflated as his OWN filmography, in his later CTE-racked years), including 26 of director John Ford's and 6 of director Frank Capra's (who can forget his Bert-the-Cop in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE?). Bond and Wayne played chess, dominoes, and poker together, also serving as ""Best Man"" at each other's weddings. They both played football for the University of Southern California, though Bond was three years ahead of Wayne. Bond was about the same size as John Wayne--6' 3"", 220 pounds--but did NOT wear elevator shoes in his later years, as did Wayne. This short mentions 30 of Bond's films by name, and states that 1935 was his biggest year, when he appeared in 30 flicks! This ""bonus feature"" also notes that he (unlike Wayne) had a doctor's note to avoid fighting in WWII--Bond was 4F because of epilepsy.",Rio Bravo
51,Nazi_Fighter_David,A beautifully controlled Western with a great score,9,30 July 2001,"For many, Hawks' 'Rio Bravo' is the perfect Western... For me it is the antithesis of 'High Noon,' and the clearest exposition of Hawks' philosophy of professionalism... His tough lawman solves his own problem without going out looking for help... So he welcomes volunteers and in fact depends on them... What is more, he wins by displaying superior skills and quicker wits...The survivors in Hawks' philosophy are the ones who conduct themselves with the greatest degree of coolness and discipline... It is not difficult to appreciate why Hawks has used substantially the 'Rio Bravo' plot, with only minor variations in both his subsequent Westerns, 'El Dorado' and 'Rio Lobo.'In Fred Zinneman's 'High Noon,' Gary Cooper struggles to round up a posse that might help him deal with four desperadoes arriving on a noon train to kill him... In ""Rio Bravo,"" John Wayne is faced with a similar situation but takes on the forces of evil in the shape of a gang of local tyrants... Wayne always makes us feel that somehow he'll cope... So when the wagon master Ward Bond asks him if he wants to use any of his men as deputies in fighting Burdette's men, he turns down the offer... Wayne, holding a brutish prisoner Joe Burdette (Claude Akins) on a murder charge, waits for the U.S. marshal to take charge of him... But the prisoner's powerful brother Nathan (John Russell) wants him free and is determined to release him by any method possible...The obvious method is the traditional onehired gunmenand, in effect, the sheriff becomes a prisoner himself, in his own town But in this instance the lawman is not absolutely without help... The two deputies are a semi-crippled veteran (Walter Brennan) and a pretty hopeless drunk with a past 'fast' reputation (Dean Martin). But the whole point about this cleverly conceived movie is that this unlikely trio do in fact have something to offer when the cards are dealt... Like the sheriff, they're professional people, and what Hawks seems to be saying is that whatever the odds, such people will always have the courage, and the deeds... This is demonstrated in one inspired sequence which has become a classic: Dean Martin  drying out and eager to win back his self-respect  tells Chance that he wants to be the one who chase the killer into a saloon, and that Chance should assume the less dangerous role of backing him up from the back door...'Rio Bravo' is a beautifully controlled film... John Wayne, who re-created and heightened the mythology of the West, is at his best...John Ford imitates Howard Hawks' tendency for having his male characters never back down from a fight even when it means they are initiating the fight themselves... In Rio Bravo's famous wordless opening, villain Claude Akins throws a silver dollar into a spittoon, daring Dude, so desperate for a drink, to humiliate himself, and get the coin... Hawks' clever camera emphasizes how far beneath the standards Dude has fallen... Now Wayne is ready to confront Akins...The same scene in Ford's 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance.' Lee Marvin trips unarmed James Stewart as he carries a steak dinner to Wayne in the restaurant where he works... He stumbles and the steak falls to the ground... Stewart has been obviously humiliated... Suddenly Wayne enters the frame, and orders Valance to peak up 'his' steak, revealing his gun belt as he faces him... He is ready for the showdown...In 'Rio Bravo,' Hawks' men win out primarily because they fight together... But Hawks helps them by having the outlaws mistakenly play a Mexican tune called 'cutthroat,' a song which Santa Anna tried to intimidate the Texans under siege in the Alamo... As the music plays, we see Dude putting down his glass untouched... He observes that his hands no longer shake...In Hawks' 'Rio Bravo' there is tenderness, and humor... In Hawks' film, a man is defined by how well he relates to women, how well he handles pressure and how he reacts to danger... Angie Dickinson playing the gambling gal, enriches the mixture with a nicely judged performance... 'Rio Bravo' is an action Western, which captures a legendary West that fits the legendary talents of Wayne and Hawks... But what makes the film so special is the relationship between the individual characters... It is a traditional, straightforward Western, good-humored and exciting, rich in original touches...The best moment of the film when Martin and Nelson join each other for some singing and guitar picking, and Walter Brennan joins in with his harmonica and his scratchy voice... The film has a terrific score by one of the great film composers Dimitri Tiomkin...",Rio Bravo

I never seen this movie until now, although i heard of Hawks. I never seen his films before. I did see ""The Thing from Another World"". Which he co-directed but he's uncredited. The picture still looks great, since it's been nearly 50 years ago it came out. This is very well filmed by cinematographer Russell Harlan, which he's makes this feature looks stylish for its time. There's many good sequences... especially when it's character-driven dialogue scenes, moments of romance or action.The two-disc set from ""Rio Bravo"". DVD is been digitally remastered for clean picture-quality and sound. Disc 1 has an fine anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 1.0 Mono Sound.

Disc 2 includes an documentary about Howard Hawks' film-making career, featurette on ""Rio Bravo"" with interviews from cast member Dickenson, film critics & fans of this movie and a small featurette about the film's location and the other classic Westerns were filmed there. ""Rio Bravo"" is a movie that still looks good after 50 years, it shows how strong that this feature could such an impact over all these years. Some viewers might find this silly at times, especially when the Characters start bonding and singing in the sheriff's station. But it's all in good fun, probably the only complaint in this movie. It's goes on a bit too long than it should. But still, don't miss this excellent movie. Screenplay by Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett (The Empire Strikes Back, The Big Sleep, The Long Goodbye).

54,slokes,With A Little Help From His Friends,8,7 December 2006,"The ultimate John Wayne movie for people who like John Wayne movies, ""Rio Bravo"" features the Duke playing not against type, like ""The Searchers,"" ""True Grit,"" or ""Red River,"" but to type, as the strong, good-natured champion of law and order battling bad guys in the Old West.Wayne is Sheriff John T. Chance, who faces trouble when he jails the brother of nasty rancher Nathan Burdette for murder. Burdette sends some desperados to break his brother out. It's up to Chance to make sure they don't, with the help of ""gimp-legged old man"" Stumpy (Walter Brennan) and a drunk called Dude (Dean Martin).""Is that all you got?"" Chance is asked.""That's what I got,"" he replies.""Rio Bravo"" is a marvelously quotable film, in part because it has so much dialogue in it. Instead of shooting, the main characters spend much of the time talking about the battle to come, passing the time by getting on each other's nerves. Dude is a bit of a walking nerve on account of his trying to quit drinking, and though Chance finds himself a girl in the form of the captivating ""Feathers"" (Angie Dickinson, looking like a young Renee Zellweger), it's his relationship with Dude that's central to the film.Dude figures out early that Chance is leaning on him in part because he figures Dude needs the impetus to get in shape. ""Be nice to him, and he'll fall apart in small pieces,"" Chance confides in Stumpy. Noticing Dude suffering from the shakes, Chance suggests a walk around the town. Dude tells him he knows what's up, sounding hurt. ""Don't set yourself up as bein' so special,"" Chance snarls back.The chemistry between Wayne and Martin goes a long way toward making ""Rio Bravo"" so special, aided by Dickinson, Brennan, Ricky Nelson as a young fence-sitter handy with a gun named Colorado (easy to ignore because he doesn't crowd anyone, but still good in his understated way), and especially director Howard Hawks, who shows here as he did with ""Only Angels Have Wings"" and ""Hatari!"" that action scenes work better when you have more invested in the characters experiencing them.I never understood the notion, advanced apparently by Hawks and Wayne, that this is an answer film to ""High Noon,"" because Will Kane in the latter film asks around town for help and thus shows himself somehow less manly a lawman. It just doesn't wash. Kane takes on the Millers pretty much alone, whereas Chance has deputies from the start. Perhaps it was the tone of ""High Noon"" that bothered them, the sparse, apathetic nature of the town and its people. While ""High Noon"" literally ticks its way to an efficient resolution, ""Rio Bravo"" demands you slow down and take stock of things.Yes, ""Rio Bravo"" is slow, and far-fetched in parts, like when Dude and Chance ignite dynamite without fuses or matches. But it's hard to whine about the two-hour 20-minute running time when you get such a comfortable feeling watching it. If you regard ""The Searchers"" as the ultimate journey film, ""Rio Bravo"" is like the destination, a place worth fighting for because it grants you the company of such vividly etched, fun-filled characters.",Rio Bravo
55,Steffi_P,"""Time for a cowboy to dream""",9,25 December 2010,"Rio Bravo was famously conceived as a red-blooded riposte to the controversial 1952 Western High Noon. Now, whether this was the primary reason for its being made, or whether it was always intended simply as a decent example of the Western genre is not entirely clear. Director Howard Hawks was a man who liked to add a little story to the creation of each of his classics. But however significant the link between the two pictures, the similarity in plots and differences on almost every other level does invite comparisons. One of the few flaws of High Noon (a good picture in itself, but not a Western classic) is that it does not really throw itself into the Western genre with all its rugged atmosphere and time-honoured cliché. Rio Bravo on the other hand is a Western of the purest and most whole-hearted kind.Howard Hawks only directed five proper Westerns, most of them towards the end of his career, but he is often remembered as one of the most important Western directors alongside Ford, Peckinpah, Leone and Eastwood. Why? I think it is because he really captured the spirit of the Old West, perhaps even better than those other directors just mentioned. In all his pictures he showed a knack for atmosphere, and he's really good at just creating a certain look of dusty plains, windswept homesteads and mean-looking saloons, all under careful control too. Take that opening scene. We first see Dean Martin in amongst all this typical saloon business, then all of a sudden he's framed in mid-shot against a bare wall, and the busy establishing shot has turned into a close look at individuals. Hawks was also a master at pacing, and really creates some classics of the tense standoff. A great example is the scene where a gunman is hiding in the saloon loft. The tension is closed down by the carefully measured performances – the gaps the characters leave between their lines, the leisurely walks, punctuating sounds like John Wayne slamming the door. Gradually the pace speeds up, with lines delivered a little quicker, and a little more nervous movement around the room, right up until the point where Martin fires. The effect High Noon achieves through rapid editing Hawks can achieve simply through well-choreographed long takes.Star John Wayne is of course a key ingredient in an archetypal Western such as this, and it is in Hawks' careful pacing of shootouts that you can see one of the major reasons why. The Duke was a very rhythmic actor – delivering lines in dribs and drabs, walking like he was never in a hurry to go anywhere but aiming to do something pretty big once he got there – and this really made him ideal for those iconic and tension-filled standoffs. Rio Bravo sees another steady and commanding performance from him. His co-star Dean Martin also gives one of his finest turns. Considering he is playing an alcoholic, the script never actually demands he play drunk, which is a good thing since it wouldn't do to have the audience laughing at him as well as the villains (this was a mistake made in the loose 1966 remake El Dorado). Instead, he gives a tortured and poignant portrayal of a man torn between getting his next drink and salvaging his dignity, and in so doing places himself squarely at the heart of the movie.Although Rio Bravo is very much a town Western, set entirely among the homesteads without ever venturing out into the really wild west, we are nevertheless continually reminded that the open plain with all its romance and danger is not far away. Gunmen ride into town with the dust flying off them, the far-off hills and cactus plants are always to be glimpsed between the ramshackle buildings, and the Dmitri Tiomkin song ""My Rifle, my pony, and me"" (a great second-act pick-me-up) tells us just where any man of the west would rather be. This again is something High Noon failed to conjure up – that sentimental allure of the unspoiled wilderness. Rio Bravo does not present a historically accurate account of the West, but it is completely faithful to the classic vision of the Western, a land where young cowboys look like rock 'n' roll stars and old cowboys look like they were chiselled out of the mountains themselves. This is one of the giants of a genre that once was.",Rio Bravo
56,ShootingShark,Unmissable Classic John Wayne Siege Western,7,21 May 2006,"John Chance is a small town Texas sheriff holding a murderer in his jail. Unfortunately, the killer's brother is a rich man with dozens of hired guns, and Chance's only friends are Dude, a drunken hasbeen deputy, Stumpy, a gimpy old man, Colorado, a greenhorn kid, and Feathers, a big-hearted card sharp. The siege is on ...In terms of excitement, drama, interesting characters and classical film-making, this may well be the best western ever made. Why is it so good ? Because the three key elements of any movie - the direction, the writing and the acting, are all top notch. The script, by Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett, is a terrific yarn but more importantly a great drama with five intriguing characters, any of whom are interesting enough to have a movie all of their own. Chance is the leader everyone looks up to, Dude is a broken wreck of a man tortured by grief and self-loathing, Stumpy a stubborn motormouth coot, Colorado a laid-back cowboy whose chief allegiance is to himself, and Feathers a good-time grifter looking for something more substantial than the high life. These five performances are exceptional, particularly Wayne, who underplays his hero as a grumpy pragmatist, and Martin, who proves in this movie what a truly fine actor he was capable of being. This cast has a terrific easy rapport, typified by the quiet moment when Martin and Nelson duet together. The direction is a textbook example of how to construct a good movie; the physical landscape of the town and the relationships between the characters are painted with simple clarity, scenes flow together seamlessly, the photography and editing are dynamic but unhurried, atmosphere and subtext are subtle yet effective - the work of a brilliant director. This film exemplifies the richest themes of the western - the importance of courage, friendship, loyalty, honour, dignity, love and trust in a lawless age - but it's also cracking good fun all the way, full of humour, badinage, suspense, action and romance. Although its traditional heroic sensibilities were largely usurped in the sixties by the equally brilliant films of Sergio Leone and Sam Peckinpah, its influence on the western genre and many aspiring filmmakers (check out John Carpenter's semi-remake Assault On Precinct 13) is inestimable. A great American movie. 7/10",Rio Bravo
57,adamjohns-42575,Put yer hands up yer bum!,5,9 February 2021,"I will admit from the start that Western films are not generally my thing, but I watched this one as it features on the British Film Institute's (BFI) top 100 of all time.I have to say that, as westerns go, this one wasn't too bad at all. It's not all tobacco chewing, gun slinging, cattle rustling and burlesque ladies. There is a story to it and while it is a bit long, at no point did I feel that it had paused anywhere too long to make it drag out deliberately or for ""Artistic Effect"". I think a large part of that was building the tension for the eventual and obvious shoot-out that had to finish the film. It certainly had a good pace.The characters are all well rounded and well played and actually I think Dean Martin gave one of his best and most natural performances.
I also loved Walter Brennan who, although it was often quite hard to understand him, did provide some comic relief.
It could perhaps have done without Angie Dickinson, as a love interest really wasn't crucial and she was a tad over the top in places.
As for ""The Duke"", I cannot watch any of his films without seeing and thinking of my Grandad who would get so invested in these films that my Nan always said that it was like he was riding the horses with them. Having also read a few bits of the IMDB trivia it seems like he was a very interesting character in real life too, just like Gramps Mont.Although it is a rough and tough and old skool masculine film, it's soft and gentle in its presentation, so that you could almost watch with most generations, mostly because the younger ones would be on their iPads, but more because it isn't in your face with blood and death and unnecessary cussing.It may have scored higher if it was from a genre I had more of an interest in.",Rio Bravo
58,Spondonman,Art!,8,12 June 2011,"This is one of my comfort films – it's so jolly and amiable that I've welcomed it as an old friend onto my TV more times than I can remember now. Full of recognisable people playing to an easily recognisable plot it's certainly not too taxing on the mind and a thoroughly enjoyable classic Western, made by past masters of the genre. And artists who thoroughly knew how to create something clever and entertaining as routine.It starts as a balletic silent, culminating with a good natured bystander getting shot dead point blank and the guilty baddie eventually dragged off to jail by Sheriff John Wayne and Deputy Dean Martin. For the next 2 hours there's plenty of scheming to spring him out by the baddies' brother and gang, romance, comedy and soap from the cast, all in the best Howard Hawks tradition. With the sheer length it can get a bit confusing whether Martin is succeeding beating the bottle and whether Wayne believes him, whether Angie Dickinson is succeeding winning Wayne's heart, whether smart kid Ricky Nelson is succeeding in minding his own business, whether cantankerous Walter Brennan is going to succeed shooting anyone by accident - but I would've loved a 4 hour version! And there was probably enough possibilities in here for a 26 part condensed soap series, so maybe Hawks did well to squeeze it all in. Sergio Leone must have seen this and learnt all he needed to do was tell similar stories similarly but turn up the sex and violence.It's not perfect (eg Wayne conking out so quickly after he tripped on the string at the bottom of the hotel stairs) but still beautiful to behold, and over and over again. A lesson for film makers indeed.",Rio Bravo
59,davidmvining,Hang Out,10,5 July 2021,"Howard Hawks, smarting from the failure of Land of the Pharaohs, left for Europe for a few years to lick his wounds and consider his next moves as a film director. While in Europe, he discovered that television westerns with emphasis on character rather than plot were fairly popular, so he returned home to America. There he found John Wayne ready and willing to work on a counterargument to Fred Zinnemann's High Noon, the story of Gary Cooper's lone sheriff in a small western town who can't get anyone to help him get ready for the arrival of a known felon out for his blood. Wayne and Hawks were of the opinion that High Noon was simply wrong in its portrayal of the West and the hero, so they made the best counterargument possible, they made another movie.John T. Chance (Wayne) is the sheriff of a small Western town. His deputy, Dean Martin's Dude, is at the tail end of a two-year bender in response to a girl leaving him. In a great, silent opening scene, Dude is so desperate for a drink that when the notorious Joe Burdette, younger brother to the most powerful man in the area Nathan Burdette, throws a dollar piece into a spittoon Dude is reticent but willing to reach in for that dollar to get him his next drink. Chance saves him from the degradation in the final second, and Joe ends up attacking Chance and shooting another man dead. Chance and Dude get Joe into custody, and the standoff begins.What's markedly different about Rio Bravo is its almost lackadaisical pace. The plot gets sidelined for long stretches as Wayne, Martin, Angie Dickenson, and Walter Brennan play off of each other with the other assorted members of the town. Quentin Tarantino apparently showed this film to every woman he ever dated, and if they didn't like it then he ended the relationship. Looking at his filmography through the lens of Rio Bravo, it suddenly all makes sense. He's been making his own version of Rio Bravo in some capacity until Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood where it almost feels like a complete homage. This isn't a movie about its plot. This is a movie about its characters in the middle of a situation. This feels like a movie made from the moments cut out of most movies. Where most movies have their characters endlessly discuss the plot, these characters discuss it occasionally and then simply try to live their lives otherwise within the confines of the situation at hand.All of that rests on a handful of things. The first is the script. Hawks was well known for allowing his actors to improvise freely on set, but in order for that to really work you need to start with a strong script that provides a great guide on who these characters are. The second is the actors themselves. They have to fit their roles almost like archetypes, understanding what the script has created in their individual characters, allowing them that space to improvise but also the boundaries on how far they can go in any particular direction. The third is the world around them. This has to feel complete, populated, and real so that it never feels like the characters have been transported from the place of the plot to somewhere else where they can talk. They still need to inhabit the world completely and at all times.Rio Bravo does all three extremely well.The script and actors use the world to full effect. They feel alive as Chance and Dude interact with Walter Brennan's Stumpy, guarding Joe in the jail with an ever-present shotgun, ready to shoot Joe should anything start up. An old friend of Chance's, Pat Wheeler (Ward Bond) rides into a town with his wagon and men including the young Colorado (Ricky Nelson), a great gunman. Pat is immediately on Chance's side, offering whatever services he can to help, but Chance refuses it all. He doesn't want to endanger the lives of those not involved of their own choosing, including Colorado even though he could use the help for sure. Into the scene walks Angie Dickenson's Feathers. Arriving in Rio Bravo on the stage, she's stuck while the stage gets fixed. She takes up at the local card game, but Chance ends up suspecting her of being noted on a handbill, and when he discovers that three cards are missing from the deck, decides to take action. It ends up she isn't the one sleeving cards (her dress won't allow it), but she was married to a noted card cheat who died a few months back. It was another guy at the table, helped caught by Colorado, who was cheating.So sets in motion the string of character vignettes that come to make up Rio Bravo. We see how Chance and Stumpy are friends with constant bickering, almost like a married couple. We see Feathers steadily fall for the manly and brave Chance. We see Dude steadily find his sobriety in the face of danger, allowed his badge once again. We see Nathan show up to start showdown with Chance, but the situation Chance has created, waiting for the US Marshalls to arrive for Joe while holding Joe under guard, is too well maintained for any sort of rash action, allowing the whole character based story to play out comfortably but believably at the same time. Colorado becomes more and more useful until he gets too involved to deny official involvement anymore, Chance finally offering him a badge.The finale centers around Dude, and I just have to take a moment to talk about Dean Martin. Martin was a lounge singer who started as the second half of a duo with Jerry Lewis, breaking off to follow his own career. He sang in Vegas alongside his buddies in the Rat Pack, even starring in the original Ocean's 11 as pretty much himself. Here he plays the drunk, self-doubting Dude really well. In fact, there's so much of him that if Hawks had been forced to cut down the running time from two hours and twenty minutes to a hundred minutes, he would have had the choice of two main characters, Chance and Dude, to center the proposed shortened movie around.Dude ends up getting captured by Nathan with the intention of trading the deputy for Joe. This leads to a shootout with Stumpy throwing dynamite that Colorado, Chance, and Dude shoot at. It's a good, explosive ending, finding a way to provide genre thrills at the tail end of a movie that's largely more concerned with character interaction.I suppose if there's a problem I have with the movie, it's that John Wayne is so obviously so much older than Angie Dickenson that it ends up coloring their interactions in a weird way that reminded me of my reaction to John McTiernan's Medicine Man. I mean, I can believe that a young woman would fall for John T. Chance, especially in the face of the danger he's up against. He's a very manly example of the sex, and I could see the appeal. But the age difference is just so obvious that it becomes a small barrier for me.Anyway, this is Hawks returning from a failure (maybe not a complete artistic failure, but definitely a commercial and critical one) in grand form. He makes a statement about heroism from one of cinema's most defining heroic personalities, countering a film he considered unbelievable (Cooper walked out of Rio Bravo apparently thinking the same thing of Hawks' film), and making a great film overall. This is just good old-fashioned movie making.",Rio Bravo
60,ctomvelu1,Jailed,7,3 July 2010,"For those used to seeing Big John Wayne galloping all over the wide open spaces of the Old West, RIO BRAVO will come as something of a shock, as most of the movie takes place on two interior sets, a jailhouse and a saloon/hotel. Wayne plays a small town sheriff who locks up a killer (Claude Akins), and the killer's brother and gang come to bust him out any way they can. The sheriff only has an old galoot named Stumpy (Walter Brennan) and a drunken deputy (Dean Martin) to help him. Most of the action is saved for the big showdown at the end. Much of the rest of the movie is a character study. Hardly Howard Hawks' best work, but worth a look. Martin disappears from a sizable segment of the story, supposedly because he runs off for a time. Once he returns, the movie seems oddly disjointed, and I have no idea what might have happened. A virtually unrecognizable Angie Dickinson is on hand as a troubled woman who falls for Big John, and a teenaged Ricky Nelson plays a Billy the Kid type who eventually sides with the good guys. . The movie has been remade four times, twice as a western and twice as an urban crime thriller.",Rio Bravo
61,alexanderdavies-99382,A sparkling Western and one of Wayne's greatest.,8,6 October 2017,"""Rio Bravo"" is a Western that's typical of John Wayne. He plays a squeaky-clean, upstanding law enforcer, someone who is quite easy-going until provoked and always believes in doing the right thing. That was the image John Wayne stuck with for most of his career and it works in ""Rio Bravo."" There is plenty of fun in this film, thanks to some good dialogue, being quite lighthearted in places, the story being pretty good and also for featuring some great action near the end. Dean Martin gives a better than average performance as the former sheriff who deals with his own demons via the bottle. He eventually finds his courage and regains some of his former glory. Old hands like Walter Brennan and Ward Bond give their usual sterling support, they were veterans of the Western genre. The running time is a bit long at 130 minutes but I personally don't find that a problem. In a town not far from the Mexican border, an outlaw is being held in the town jail. For John Wayne, that means the entire gang of which the outlaw is a member, shall be riding into town with the intention of springing their comrade. Wayne only has a drunken former sheriff, a deputy with a crippled leg and a young and inexperienced gunfighter for support. The direction from Howard Hawks keeps the film ticking along at a good pace. Wayne's movies with Hawks are equally as good as the ones he made with John Ford.",Rio Bravo
62,bkrauser-81-311064,A Western About Community with Redemption in Mind,8,20 March 2016,"The name John Wayne immediately conjures up images of the wild west much like the name Alfred Hitchcock conjures notions of suspense. Starting on the silver screen at nineteen, John Wayne still holds the American record for the most lead roles (142) in a career spanning into the seventies. Plainspoken, strong-willed and more than willing to take a tumble or two, John Wayne's name still stands the test of time; a name ubiquitous even today.Rio Bravo begins in near total silence. Local sheriff and former gunslinger the Dude (Martin) tries to pay for a drink at the local watering hole. Already drunk and out of money, local miscreant Joe Burdette tries to roughs him up. In the chaos Marshall John T. Chance (Wayne) tries to intervene but is punched in the jaw by the Dude who's trying to save face. A man is killed and Joe is arrested by the sore Chance and the still drunk Dude. In order to bring Joe to justice, Chance must team up with the Dude, Colorado Ryan (Nelson), a young gunslinger; local codger Stumpy (Brennan), and a travelling gambler named Feathers (Dickinson). In the shadows lurks Joe's older brother Nathan (Russell) who comes to town with a posse set on freeing his brother and killing anyone who tries to stop them.Much like Arthur Miller's ""The Crucible"" and On the Waterfront (1954), The story of Rio Bravo was written as a response to High Noon (1952). Famed for being the western for people who hate westerns, High Noon is regarded as an allegory to Hollywood's reaction to the House Un-American Activities Committee's red- baiting. Wayne at the time, was president of the Motion Picture Alliance and set out to make a counterpoint to Gary Cooper's Marshal Kane. Sheriff Chance doesn't ask for help from the townsfolk despite overwhelming odds. In-fact at several points he refuses help from anyone he doesn't feel would be useful in a fight. He's practical and duty-bound as opposed to wry and moralistic.Each important player, comes into the film with something to prove to the world. Dean Martin's career as a nightclub crooner was on the wane and while his third billing in The Young Lions (1958) was well received, nothing thus far compared to his partnership with Jerry Lewis. Looking to become a ""serious"" actor, Martin ended the partnership tumultuously in 1956. Meanwhile the eighteen-year-old Ricky Nelson was hot off the billboard charts and was given the role of Colorado only after Elvis Presley dropped out. Ricky symbolized the coming era of rock & roll to some of the old timers; an attitude that was not lost on him when Wayne and Martin threw him in a pile of steer manure on-set as a ""right of passage"". Then there was The Duke, who had not had a surefire hit since Hondo (1953). He dabbled in a few war films since then as well as a few historically misguided films, The Conqueror (1956) being the most loathsome. He also made what's widely considered his greatest accomplishment The Searchers (1956), a film not well received during its time but has since been ranked as one of the best westerns ever.Director Howard Hawks was also trying to get out of a downward spiral since his sword-and-sandal epic Land of the Pharaohs (1955) epically tanked at the box office. The famed studio director, dubbed The Silver Fox for managing to ferret his way into every Hollywood genre met his Waterloo. After a few years living in Europe, Hawks was ready to return to the director's chair and decided on Rio Bravo's beautiful script as his comeback. To hedge his bets Hawk's had his sets built 7/8ths to scale to make the actors and characters appear larger than life; not that the 6'3'' Wayne ever needed help with that.At two hours and twenty one minutes, Rio Bravo feels much more episodic than El Dorado (1966) or Rio Lobo (1970) (two films with identical conceits, said to be indirect remakes). The story also feels stronger, grittier and more universal. Those not intimidated by the film's near-mythic status and are itching to see multiple talents reaching for redemption, you'd do well to watch Rio Bravo.",Rio Bravo
63,Sergeant_Tibbs,An absolute joy to watch.,9,10 July 2013,"Rio Bravo has always been one of those classics I've never been too excited for. By the first scene, I was hooked. This is only my third John Wayne film which I'm surprised by because I feel like I'm more familiar with him. The other two are The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance which I really like and The Searchers which is good but has its flaws. Its charms comes from its colourful and warm network of great characters. It has a lot of heart and I come to care from them all greatly and genuinely wish them no harm during inevitable danger. In particular, the tragic and heart-breaking-or-making Dean Martin, who's a pleasure to watch in every single scene he's in, especially in one in which he sings with Ricky Nelson.The witty script has a great dry sense of humour with every joke hitting the mark and making it an even more relaxed affair than it already is. There isn't much urgency in the plot, with a simple story stretching for 2 hours and 15 minutes, but it never feels too slow or rushed (despite this jarring with the ever-present possibility of death). It effortlessly weaves the compelling character drama within the narrative and it's a genuine pleasure to watch. The great cinematography and sets are the best pre-Sergio Leone era I've seen in a Western with a fantastic sepia colour theme but not completely saturated. Rio Bravo is pure cinematic bliss. A very pleasant and welcome surprise. As a sidenote, this is the third new favourite from 1959 I've seen so far this year. Good year.9/10",Rio Bravo
64,valadas,Old-fashioned but good,7,16 July 2018,"Yes westerns are old-fashioned now but some of the old ones like this one are still good and pleasant to watch. This movie combines in a very realistic way suspense, action, sentiment and humour.
Howard Hawks has done very good movies between 1926 and 1970 not all of them westerns. This movie has great actors like John Wayne (one of Hawks' favourites) and Dean Martin who perform great roles here.
This is the simple story of a small town in Texas where a sheriff (John Wayne) has two assistants, one a drunkard (Dean Martin) and the other an old crippled man. He's got to face a powerful gang that is trying to free one of its members who was arrested for murder by the sheriff. The action develops itself in several episodes many of them violent but acceptable in terms of psychological and visual reality. A good film of its kind.",Rio Bravo

It is a fine mixture of light comedy and male camaraderie and dignity under duresse and threat. It is also a grand example of its genre, an apogee of the classic Western. The casting is excellent with brilliant performances from Wayne, Martin, Dickinson and Brennan. It has a slick finish with superb Technicolor photography and a superb score which provides some poignant relief from the tension. As an aside, the film was remade as El Dorado (1966), and again as Rio Lobo (1970) and both starred John Wayne.",Rio Bravo
66,MartianOctocretr5,Character driven western with great cast and plenty of action,8,17 May 2006,"Enjoyable and fun character-driven ""shoot 'em up"" style western, featuring an appealing ensemble cast.John Wayne is town marshal ""John T."", and he has none other than the likes of Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, and Walter Brennan as his battery of dead-eye-shootin' deputies. Considering they played characters named, respectively, ""Dude,"" ""Colorado,"" and ""Stumpy, you know these guys had a blast making this movie. Angie Dickinson is terrific to look at as usual, and plays Wayne's romantic interest.They're holed up in the town jail, guarding a prisoner (Claude Akins), whose powerful brother is trying to bust him out. The action is typical John Wayne/Howard Hawks (director) fare: frequent gun play and action, mixed with humorous, snappy dialog, as the film good-naturedly pokes fun at itself. (Who would expect a singing collaboration of Martin, Nelson, and Brennan?) Martin's character is a drunk trying to dry out--that sounds like an ""insert joke here"" setup, not to mention an old western cliché. But Martin's acting is strong and effective--Dude is a character that is developed well and is integral to the storyline. Brennan perfected his ""old geezer sidekick"" routine (frequently imitated by others), and Nelson obviously got a kick out of his ""young gunfighter"" role. Wayne is, of course, patriarchal, and predictably good at shooting bad guys.A cleverly done final confrontation between the two camps does not disappoint after the build-up throughout the movie. Definitely recommended for western fans, and Wayne fans, but even other viewers should find this movie a good watch.",Rio Bravo
67,frankde-jong,A more heroic Western,8,12 October 2020,"""Rio Bravo"" has much in common with ""High Noon"" (1952, Fred Zinnemann). In both films a little town is awaiting the vengeance of a dreaded rogue. In ""High Noon"" because the rogue was trapped by the Marshal of the town and was recently released. In ""Rio Bravo"" the Sheriff has put his brother in prison.""Rio Bravo"" not only has much in common with ""High Noon"", in fact it is a reaction on this film. In ""High Noon"" the Marshal is looking for help in vain and is on his own in his struggle against the criminal. ""High Noon"" is in essence a very pessimistic film. Too pessimistic in the opinion of the makers of ""Rio Bravo"", especially lead actor John Wayne, and they made a more heroic Western in which the Sheriff does get help from different people.In my opinion ""High Noon"" is the better film, but ""Rio Bravo"" is not bad either. It was the come back film of Howard Hawks, after (the failure of) ""Land of the Pharaos"" (1955), and he proved that he had not forget his trade. The emphasis on the film is not on the battle with the criminals (although the shootout is spectacular ebough) , but on the dynamics in the inner circle of the Sheriff.The centre of the inner circle is of course Sheriff John T. Chance hilmself, a subdued and remarkable ""un-tough"" role of John Wayne. Dean Martin plays his assistent who has problems with the bottle. Walter Brennan (winning in his career three Oscars for best supporting actor) plays old Stumpy. He is the comic relief of the movie and his humour is well dosed. Ricky Nelson, at that time a rival of Elvis Presley, plays the overconfident boy. Of course he gets his own song in the movie to promote himself. Most striking in this inner circle is the young Angie Dickinson as ""Feathers"", the love interest of John T. Chance. Despite the quite large age difference (27 vs 51) the chemistry between the two is undeniably one of the gems of the movie.",Rio Bravo
68,BrandtSponseller,Western Tai Chi,10,6 February 2005,"When Joe Burdette (Claude Akins) murders a man on a whim, Sheriff John T. Chance (John Wayne) arrests him and puts him in small Texas town's jail. The problem is that the U.S. Marshall is a week away from taking Burdette off his hands, and Burdette's brother, Nathan (John Russell), won't see his brother put away. Complicating the situation even further, Burdette is rich enough to hire a score of thugs, and the only support that Chance has is from a drunk, Dude (Dean Martin), and an elderly crippled man, Stumpy (Walter Brennan).Rio Bravo is a sprawling pressure cooker. For anyone not used to the pacing of older films, this is not the best place to begin. Uninitiated audiences are likely to find it boring--the plot is relatively simple, and they would likely have a difficult time remaining with Rio Bravo for its 2 hour and 21 minute running time. It's best to wait until one is acclimated to this kind of pacing, so as not to spoil the experience. The film is well worth it.John Wayne was an enthralling paradox, and maybe no film better demonstrates why than Rio Bravo. He had almost delicate ""pretty boy"" looks and a graceful gait that were an odd contrast to his hulking height and status as the ""action hero"" of his day. He speaks little, and doesn't need to, although he is the star and thus the center of attention. He tends to have an odd smirk on his face. Wayne's performance here interestingly parallels the pacing and tenor of the film--that's not something that one sees very often, or at least it's not something that's very easy to make conspicuous.And he's not the only charismatic cast member. Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, Walter Brennan and Angie Dickinson are equally captivating. Even when the full blow-out action sequence begins (and that's not until about two hours into the film, although there are a few great shorter action scenes before that), the focus here is still on the interrelationships between these characters, with Brennan the continually funny comic foil, Nelson the suave, skilled youngster, Martin the complex and troubled but likable complement to Wayne, and Dickinson as the sexy, forward and clever love interest.Director Howard Hawks seems to do everything right. He guides cinematographer Russell Harlan in capturing subtly beautiful scenery--like the mountains in the distance over the tops of some buildings, and a great sunrise shot--and asks for an atmospheric score (such as the repeated playing of Malaguena by a band in the background) that shows that plot points weren't the only element of the film that influenced John Carpenter (who partially based his Assault on Precinct 13 (1976) on this film). But most intriguing is probably Hawks' staging/blocking. You could easily make a study of just that aspect of the film. The characters are always placed in interesting places in the frame, and they're constantly moving in interesting ways throughout the small collection of buildings and streets that make up the town. There is almost a kind of performance art aspect to it. Wayne, for instance, repeatedly touches base at the jail, then picks up his rifle, circles around to the hotel and back, almost as if he's doing some kind of western Tai Chi.Rio Bravo is nothing if not understated, and as such, it may take some adjustments from modern, especially younger, viewers. But it's a gem of a film, and worth watching and studying.",Rio Bravo
69,bobsgrock,A fine wrap-up to Hawks' career.,8,3 July 2009,"Although this wasn't Howard Hawks final film, it almost certainly was his last great film, one that transcended the usual standards of the genre and used character study and dialog to overshadow action sequences. Supposedly the conservative response to High Noon, Hawks and star John Wayne have created a glorious tribute to the Old West, as well as gathering a great supporting cast to help along the way.Wayne is perfect here is John T. Chance, with his slow drawl delivery and gimpy walk, he resembles a man who has witnessed plenty of evil in this small town and just wished it would go away. He has to try and keep a man from being sprung from jail and his only help is an old cripple named Stumpy (Walter Brennan in a scene-stealing role), a recovering drunk named Dude (Dean Martin in the best role of the film), and a quick, young sharpshooter named Colorado Ryan (Ricky Nelson in a very fine performance). All the elements come together here along with the strong writing which allows for the characters to embrace their own situations and work to resolve the one they are all in. The first hour or so simply sets up the background: Chance is the longtime sheriff, Dude is struggling to stay off the sauce, and a woman gets off the coach and immediately starts up a relationship with Chance.In another director's hands, this would be all action leading up to one final explosive scene. Here, action is minimal and used sparingly, so when the final action scene does come it is not only expected but exciting and satisfying. As I mentioned before, I though Dean Martin's performance was Oscar-worthy as a former drunk with plenty of problems, but realizes he needs to fix this one. It is such a great work of sympathy and desperation, you just feel for this guy and hope that he gets it all worked out. Certainly not the best Western I've ever seen, but this one works in Hawks' famous definition of a good movie: three great scenes, no bad ones. It was never more evident here.",Rio Bravo
70,MiketheWhistle,"Yep lots of negative can be said, but still an awesome western",10,4 December 2019,"There are lots of westerns, and John Wayne certainly was one of the best. In this you get Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, Angie Dickinson who is very attractive, Claude Atkins, and more.
It's interesting to read all the negative stuff, but I really enjoy this pic. I particularly like old movies with people who later became big stars like Ms. Dickinson. Add the singing by two great performers truly makes it worth while.",Rio Bravo
71,FightingWesterner,Great Movie,9,5 October 2009,"I'll leave the over-analysis and political talk (Rio Bravo vs. High Noon Blah, Blah, Blah...etc.) to other reviewers and state simply that this is a superb picture with great action sequences, quick gun play, and tough characterizations by sheriff John Wayne, cantankerous Walter Brennon, and Dean Martin as a drunken deputy (real stretch, huh?), not to mention an excellent musical interlude with Martin, Ricky Nelson, and Walter Brennon.I love the cinematography and especially the old-fashioned Technicolor. As I've said before in other reviews, I think the decline in the western film is in part due to advances in color photography. Once the exaggerated hues of Technicolor dimmed, the west just didn't seem as bright.The one flaw of Rio Bravo (and a lot of films at the time) is how badly integrated the romantic subplot between Wayne and Angie Dickenson was with the rest of the script. Almost as if it were added later as an after thought, it contributed significantly to the over-length of the film - Sorry Angie.",Rio Bravo
72,hnt_dnl,A sublime masterful Western,10,26 July 2008,"RIO BRAVO is one of the most entertaining films ever! It's one of those films that I can watch repeatedly without ever getting bored. If you're a fan of John Wayne, then THIS is the perfect film for you. Wayne is effortless in his portrayal of the movie's hero Sheriff John T. Chance. He was so natural in Westerns, born to play in them. No matter how challenging or different the role, Wayne always thrived in Westerns. And he rarely played the same character, which is ironic since many thought he was typecast as the Western hero. You're telling me that the heroic everyman John T. Chance is the same as the disturbed, racist Ethan Edwards (THE SEARCHERS) or the stubborn pioneer John Dunston (RED RIVER)? I don't think so. And Mr. Wayne played all these challenging roles with amazing accuracy and aplomb. The man could act! I've seen some say that this role for Wayne was 'easy' for him b/c he just got to play himself. One thing is for sure: Wayne completely carries this long film from start to finish! The characters are what drive RIO BRAVO. The plot isn't so much important. But Chance is holding local thug and killer Joe Burdett (effectively played by Claude Akins) in jail while waiting for the territory marshal to pick him up. All the help Chance has are his 2 deputies Dude (brilliantly played by Dean Martin) and Stumpy (the funny Walter Brennan). Special mention should go to Martin, who has to have given the best performance of his career in this film. He realistically relays the role of the alcoholic who is truly trying to change. It's actually amazing that they put such a powerful topic in a film like this, but it completely works. Also, Martin is NOT a supporting character in this film. He is essentially the second lead next to Wayne.Brennan is as usual a card as Wayne's sidekick. Also in supporting roles are Angie Dickinson and Ricky Nelson, who are both a little immature for their roles, but still both do a fine job with what they are given to work with. Main kudos go to Wayne and Martin in the acting department. The director Howard Hawks creates a special, isolated world in this tiny Texas burg. The dialogue is especially simple, but yet situations and characters are so well-defined, you almost feel like you are spying in on this world, rather than watching a 'movie'.",Rio Bravo
73,sharky_55,I said I'd arrest you.,9,14 September 2019,"Angie Dickinson may get all the best lines in Rio Bravo, but John Wayne is the one that she surrenders to in the end. She is the prototypical Hawksian woman; witty, sharp as a knife, wielding her sexuality with provocation. Her drawl is the antithesis of Hawks' earlier screwballs and their mile-a-minute dialogue, overlapping and building to a comedic climax. When Feathers sashays and suggests a strip-search, and when she dangles her arms around his neck and pulls him in for a second kiss after a lacklustre first effort, you'll see a rare glimpse of a John Wayne character flustered.By slowing it all down, Hawks was able to build his scenes from the ground up, filling them to the brim with tension. See the iconic opening, a wordless 5 minute sequence that renders a simple bar scuffle into an operatic showdown. Dude enters from the back door a sweaty outsider, lurking in the shadows and pacing back and forth, eyes darting towards the drink. The camera doesn't rush him; you can see why Kurosawa drew inspiration from the American western, where Mifune got his steady, measured shuffle from. Dean Martin, the disgraced star, crawls to the ground for a coin, only to usher in the entrance of the town sheriff, Wayne towering over his failed protégé. No more than a minute later, they are holding a murderer at gunpoint together.It was filmed at the Old Tucson studio backlot, so there are no expansive vistas of the west ala John Ford. The daytime exterior shots do little to hide the appearance of a set, reflecting a campy western aesthetic (see the bickering over dynamite throwing in the climax), but the interiors of the homesteads and taverns, particularly at night, come alive. Russell Harlan's lighting is sparse, throwing long, hard shadows across the rooms; one striking shot captures the standoff between Dude and a group of tight-lipped men on Burdette's payroll from an overhead view, the stare-down framed by the shadowy recesses of the ceiling, and a bloodied man waiting behind a pillar with a gun. Patrolling after sundown, the pair find danger and menace lurking around every corner, with sudden noises (a neighing horse, or a gunshot) punctuating the nervous energy in the air.On the surface, Rio Bravo is a pure, red-blooded American western, a full-bodied tonic for the patriot in the wake of High Noon. While Billy Wilder's Some Like It Hot pushed against the boundaries of the Hays Code in the same year, Hawks' film represented a return to normalcy. The rules of the game are clear cut and simple. Shoot a man and it's murder, unless he has a gun, in which case it's upholding the law. A man's worth is determined by how quick he is on the draw, and his life, mere gold pieces. Women? Window dressing, unless you're Feathers and as stubborn as a mule, in which case you become an honourary member of the posse. But even she yields to Wayne eventually.Chance, unlike Gary Cooper's Will Kane, does not ever admit he needs help, nor does he make an overt show of asking for it. Wayne, at the height of his career, was enough; strutting around with a glare and rifle, he was the living embodiment of the dutiful sheriff, the heroic figure, reaffirming his moral authority with every growl. But look who answers the call anyway. A old timing cripple, a kid gunslinger, the local drunk, a Mexican innkeeper, and a gambler; an endearing band of misfits if there ever was one. They sing and smoke together (whether it be cigarettes or villains), and have each other's backs. Wayne's tough exterior never truly cracks, but he comforts and protects in his own way. Look at his sneer of disapproval at Dude quitting and running back to the bottle; it's almost enough to force the whiskey back in. And during the film's most tender moment, the narrative pauses while three cowboys sing along to the soft strumming of a guitar. In an era of tough men and political divide, as Mark Cousins puts it, this might be the closest thing to a family the western frontier had. Chance is there, too. He does not sing, but he just might be humming along.",Rio Bravo
74,gftbiloxi,Enjoyable Wayne Western,7,6 May 2005,"Director Howard Hawks and actor John Wayne must have thought the story effective, for they essentially remade RIO BRAVO twice more, first as EL DORADO in 1967 and then as RIO LOBO in 1970. In this particular version, Dean Martin is a run-down sheriff who has lost all self-respect and is busy drinking his way to the bottom of the barrel--but old friend John Wayne drifts into town and soon sets about whipping him into shape. With old-timer Walter Brennan and youngster Ricky Nelson at their sides, and with a little support from Angie Dickinson, they clean up the town.As the first of the three versions, RIO BRAVO generally receives the most approval--but although enjoyable, I have always felt it compares unfavorably with EL DORADO. Both films have a relaxed tone, neatly mixing the western-style action with healthy doses of enjoyable comedy, but of the two RIO BRAVO seems much looser in both script and execution and somewhat less well cast. Then pop-star Ricky Nelson is cast in an effort to appeal to teenagers, and believe it or not the film comes to a grinding halt that he might perform the obligatory song; in the meantime, the usually expert Angie Dickinson is broadsided by some of the worst dialogue this side of the Pecos.Even so, Wayne and Martin play very well and have considerable chemistry--certainly more than enough to hold your interest right through to the end--and although the film sometimes feels slow, when the action kicks in it kicks in hard and with plenty of excitement.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Rio Bravo
75,SanteeFats,Another JW classic,9,2 May 2013,"This movie is an excellent western. John Wayne is John Wayne and that is almost always a good thing. Ricky Nelson does a good job as the gun fighter and doesn't over act the part. Walter Brennan is hilarious as Stumpy, the cantankerous deputy. The main plot is a lot like the one from El Dorado with the drunken, broken down, friend who is also the sheriff getting straightened out and brought back to being the tough lawman that runs the town again. Ward Bond has what is almost a cameo but does his usual fine job. I have never really cared for Angie Dickenson and her role here is no exception. I found her acting to be very flat and uninspired, almost like she was just going through the motions. Except for her though I think this another very good one by the Duke.",Rio Bravo
76,dglink,How the West Was Not,8,18 February 2008,"Amiable and largely entertaining, ""Rio Bravo"" is all that Hollywood westerns strive to be and about as far from the actual west as films likely get. With such western stalwarts as John Wayne, Walter Brennan, and Ward Bond working under the direction of Howard Hawks, what more could a western aficionado ask for? The bad guys, headed by John Russell and Claude Aikens, snarl, wear black hats, and act like unrequited villains to the end. The good guys smile, always hit their targets, and bond despite differences in age, sobriety, and vocal skills. Why, the good guys even loll around the sheriff's office strumming guitars and crooning songs. Did Wyatt Earp really strike up duets with Doc Holliday? Never mind, ""Rio Bravo"" does not strive for authenticity, just rousing fun.The three western veterans that head the cast, Wayne, Brennan, and Bond, have performed in so many horse operas that the dust of the open plains is lodged in their lungs. Although Dean Martin's slick image initially works against him, he tries hard and eventually convinces the audience that, even if he does not fit the image of a gunslinger, he is a fine sensitive actor, when given the chance. Unfortunately, one singer was not enough for Hawks, and he evidently hired Ricky Nelson to attract teenage girls to the film. Whatever Ricky Nelson was, a sharp shooting gunman he was not. His acting skills were honed on ""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet,"" and they do not carry him here against heavyweights such as Wayne and Brennan. His voice and American Bandstand haircut are 1950's New Jersey, not 1880's frontier. Although Angie Dickinson is also coiffed out of period, she does well as the leading lady, who inexplicably pursues Wayne. Why the leggy twenty-something would overlook the dark good looks of Martin or the baby face of Nelson for craggy middle-aged Wayne is one of the plot's deeper mysteries.At 141 minutes, ""Rio Bravo"" runs long, and the aforementioned crooning scene could have been judiciously trimmed, although the teenyboppers would have likely protested. Tightening the scenes between Wayne and Dickinson would not have hurt either. Her coy come-ons to the fatherly Wayne are not convincing in any case. However, despite the quibbles, ""Rio Bravo"" will satisfy most with its humor, genial performances, classic good-guys-versus-bad-guys storyline, gunfights, fistfights, and male bonding. And, yes, even Martin's mellow voice and Nelson's guitar plucking are pleasant diversions. However, ""Rio Bravo"" does not depict how the west was really won. Gunshots are bloodless, hotel rooms are freshly painted, and women play poker with the guys. Perhaps, ""Rio Bravo"" shows how the west should have been.",Rio Bravo
77,bob998,Great Western,9,6 October 2016,"The Western is not my favourite genre, but when I run across one made with the skill and genius of Howard Hawks, I just sit back and let the story unfold. Two and one-half hours may be excessive for some, but the story really needs to be told without time constraints (Budd Boetticher would have done it in little more than an hour, and it would have been poorer for that). I liked the way Hawks kept the story within the confines of the town, not bothering to soak up the magnificent scenery so beloved of Ford and Mann.Russell Harlan's fine camera-work serves to increase the tension throughout (Harlan did To Kill a Mockingbird, Witness for the Prosecution and many more fine pictures). The performances are excellent. Many have said Dean Martin has never been better--he outdoes himself here, makes me reflect on how good he was in Some Came Running. Angie Dickinson gives a tremendous performance as Feathers; she seems assured for much of the time, yet there is an underlying insecurity. We keep waiting for her to get on the stagecoach and she never does. Walter Brennan gives a lovely impression of Dogberry from Much Ado About Nothing--endearing confusion. John Wayne is still handsome at 52, and carries himself with that assurance we knew so well. His acting skills were never the point. If Ricky Nelson is hardly a great actor, he is a capable one. I liked the way he says ""I speak English, sheriff"" as a form of introduction to Chance.",Rio Bravo
78,bankofmarquis,The Quntessential Western,9,30 December 2014,"If I were to put one Western of this era in a time capsule as an example of this genre, RIO BRAVO would be the one I would put in there.This is the quintessential Western of the 40's & 50's with all the elements working wonderfully together to bring a very entertaining film to the screen.As with most of these Westerns, the place to start is JOHN WAYNE. He embodies this genre. Tough but fair. Hard but gentle. Willing to kill, but not liking it. Rio Bravo has Wayne at the top of his game. He is ably aided by a strong supporting cast - Dean Martin as the drunken deputy (he can act!), Ricky Nelson as the young kid learning life lessons from Wayne. Angie Dickinson, though about half Wayne's age at the time of filming, as the love interest and good ol' Walter Brennan as the sidekick, Stumpy.Throw in Howard Hawks strong direction and this movie is what it is.

Just good versus bad.And darn entertaining.9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",Rio Bravo
79,elvircorhodzic,"""A game-legged old man and a drunk. That's all you got?""",9,24 February 2017,"RIO BRAVO is a strange, but very good combination between western and a comical melodrama. A local sheriff, in a small Texas town, has arrested a mean bully for a murder. The killer's brother, a wealthy rancher, has hired a small army of professional mercenaries, with the intent to rescue him from prison. The sheriff has resisted against bandits with the help of unusual friends...Mr. Hawks has, above all, drew attention of the audience to the protagonists in this film. Characterization is not ideal, but this is a very bold move. Gunfights in a tense atmosphere are certainly part of this film. However, melodrama with comic and somewhat ironic reflections is primary in the story. Dialogues are simple and witty. The final calculation is very fast and exciting, but it does not represent a classic confrontation between good and bad guys in the Wild West.John Wayne as Sheriff John T. Chance is one sturdy and charming character. He has offered a confident performance. Mr. Wayne is a real macho with an ironic attitude and a clear objective in this film. Angie Dickinson as Feathers is a traveling entertainer. She is a chatty lady and sheriff's support. Two of them created a special story. Unfortunately, the chemistry between the two of them, was not good. Romance, except for some comic and sexy interruptions, was unconvincing.Dean Martin as Dude is a former sheriff's deputy and a local drunk. He leads the battle with self-esteem. His character is serious and credible. He is the element of surprise and healing in this film. Ricky Nelson as Colorado Ryan just did not get the right opportunity. A young gunman, who has swaggered with his guns and a guitar. Walter Brennan (Stumpy) as a crippled and garrulous deputy is truly funny.Perhaps, this is only a conservative response to ""High Noon"", but I think that this film is an enjoyable western fun with pretty unusual protagonists, who are resisting violence in the background of the story.",Rio Bravo
80,bigverybadtom,Great Interaction Between The Three Leads,9,30 September 2016,"This Western movie works in large part because of the interaction of the main three characters: John Chance the town sheriff, Dude as an alcoholic cowboy trying to get clean, and Stumpy as an elderly cripple who serves in the sheriff's office. They argue and spar throughout the movie, adding much comic relief to an otherwise conventional story.Joe Burnett is a powerful local rancher who kills an innocent bystander during a fight he provoked, and is arrested and taken to the town jail for it, where the sheriff and the deputized Dude and Stumpy hold him in wait for the marshal. They hold off the rancher's brother and his hired hands, while in the meantime an old friend of Chance comes to town with his group, as well as a woman named Feathers who is a card player and possible cheater. The questions are whether Chance and company can hold off the hired hands, and whether Dude can stay clean and competent as he withdraws from his alcoholism, and how good is Stumpy with his health problems anyway. Also what is the story with Colorado, the young man who came with the supply train, and will he get involved? Not until after watching the movie did I learn about this movie being a deliberate answer to ""High Noon"", where that sheriff kept going to the townspeople begging them for help, only they were too cowardly. Chance is different; he refuses outside help but gets it anyway. A more convincing scenario when you think about it.",Rio Bravo
81,joachimokeefe,The Silver Dollars Are In The Spittoon.,1,1 December 2018,"Impossible to spoil, even if I wanted to. It's a comic book, a child's tale of goodies and baddies. Tom Mix in VistaVision.Deemed a 'classic' because it's (very) solidly made, got some nice tunes and is utterly, utterly formulaic; the template for a few thousand mediocre TV and cinema westerns over the next thirty or so years.See the stereotypes: The overage, creaky patriarch (Wayne), the cute young hotshot kid (Nelson), the fragile-but-feisty female (Dickinson) who finds the aged patriarch irresistible, the crusty light-relief old manservant (Brennan), the slightly halfwitted Hispanic family (Manuel from Fawlty Towers?), while Dean Martin as 'Dude', or 'Borrachon', provides the sole dramatic plot turn as a dead-shot drunk fighting the bottle. Which he KOs in round three. Elvis Presley's throat problem in Jailhouse Rock was slightly more intense - it certainly mattered to the plot, while Deano is just there to make up the numbers - oh, and give Ricky Nelson some musical credibility with the senior folks.Whether or not it's actually intended as a response to the HUAC-relevant, character-driven High Noon, Rio Bravo is nothing more than a turgid, glossy children's melodrama. It certainly doesn't feature any relatable human beings or dilemmas from the planet Earth. If you like fantasy westerns, Rio Bravo will float your silver dollar for a couple of hours.",Rio Bravo

Otherwise it was a good movie, and what a decent cast for a western movie which includes some of his Red River stars John Wayne and Walter Brennan, who end up teaming with Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson and the man who ends up in most of Wayne's films Ward Bond. The movie goes on a par with western movie greats such as High Noon, Unforgiven, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, The Big Country, Pale Rider, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, Winchester 73, The Naked Spur, The Cowboys, The Sons of Katie Elder, True Grit, The Shootist, and as I mentioned earlier Red River.

The sheriff has a man in jail, and the man's brother and their ""associates"" want him out. It's an old west standoff! Complete with ""El Degüello"" playing in the background! Walter Brennan is hilarious as Stumpy, and his chemistry with John Wayne is dang near perfect! Angie Dickinson is gorgeous, but her love story was pretty weak, though no fault of hers. The only other weakness in the film is Ricky Nelson, and he is pretty bad. But the film overcomes him, and it is a nice, slow trip through the wild ol' west. With just ""my rifle, my pony, and me""!",Rio Bravo
84,manuel-pestalozzi,Shoot-first-think-later classic,4,20 February 2006,"So this was supposed to be the real"" spirit of the West as opposed to the one shown in High Noon? A fashion conscious sheriff who wears a red shirt on one day and a blue one the next (who does his laundry?). A drunkard and an old geezer as his helpers. A funny"" stereotype Mexican couple who run a hotel. A dance hall girl who has sort of a crush on the sheriff. A saloon keeper. And lots and lots of firearms and ammo. In the beginning there are quite a few people on the streets, later the town seems to be deserted except for the afore mentioned persons plus an unspecified amount of hired gunmen out to free an imprisoned murderer.Where did all the people of the little town go? They just disappear without any trace. My guess is that there was much more gun action than shown on screen and that many a good citizen succumbed under the friendly fire"" of the forces of the law. John Wayne and his companions are nervous and extremely trigger happy, the sheriff's plan to hold out alone and wait for the Marshall to pass through the town does not seem to be dictated by common sense (there would have been alternatives) but by personal pride. There is no interaction whatsoever between him and the community he is supposed to serve. Frankly, the sheriff seems to be a pretty irresponsible guy with the mind of an adolescent  and responsibility was the main theme of High Noon, a film, it must be said, of a different league.On the whole I find Rio Bravo an unconvincing movie. The main protagonists have to deliver long, winding, unnatural monologues as to their motives and feelings, which makes the movie also slow at times. This surplus of talk unfortunately does not give it or its message more substance but harms it suspensewise. Amidst the general mediocrity, the brilliant performance of Dean Martin as the alcoholic who wants to regain his standing among men stands out. The same can be said for the use of music which is beautiful and fitting.I am a great admirer of John Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13, a low budget movie reportedly based on Rio Bravo. I count it to my all time favorites. Amazingly, Carpenter's version of the story works far better, is more convincing (also in a moral sense), more gripping and on the whole more intelligent than the original"".",Rio Bravo

The Mexicans are stereotyped, but the film was made in 1958 when this was normal movie fare. There are no Indians in the film. John Wayne can only play John Wayne, and he does so successfully here. Ricky Nelson is a bit overmatched by his role. Dean Martin displays more acting range than I expected. Walter Brennan plays Walter Brennan with a cranky old man's accent.It's decent entertainment.",Rio Bravo

Dean Martin shines as does Duke, but Mr.Gonzalez-Gonzalez steals the show. Don't take this movie too seriously and it is very entertaining.",Rio Bravo
87,adrianovasconcelos,Great Western made greater by self-deprecating humor,9,19 April 2020,"John Wayne famously said that the events depicted in HIGH NOON (US 1952) could never have happened in a US town, and in 1959 he jumped at the chance to do a Western with Howard Hawks showing how the people of a town under siege do not abandon their lawman.I happen to believe that the events in HIGH NOON could have happened anywhere in the world. In addition, I have never rated John Wayne a good actor, but in this film he fares better than usual. He's still the ever dominant macho, he gets the beautful girl in the end, but this time he has some respect for the three souls helping him out of a tough situation: Dean Martin, Walter Brennan and Ricky Nelson.Dean Martin, also a limited actor, posts his best performance ever in this film. He plays a drunkard, and a has-been pistol wizard on the comeback trail by containing his booze intake, and taking on the role of deputy sheriff.Ricky Nelson embodies the growing importance of youth in the movies in the 1950s - he actually has the temerity to stand up to Wayne and earns the latter's respect in the process!Angie Dickinson, then in the middle of affairs with the Kennedy brothers, is beautiful beyond words. I don't think any man could ignore such beauty, especially when she is in her undergarments at the end of the movie.But it is the wonderful Walter Brennan who steals the show as Stumpy, a cripple with a squeaky voice, and a spirited hoot of a laugh. Brennan is, of course, the only actor to have won three supporting actor Oscars so far (Daniel Day-Lewis won three Best Actor Oscars, Jack Nicholson two Best Actor and one Supporting Actor Oscars).Hawks' direction is fantastic, as is the photography.The reason I do not give RIO BRAVO 10/10 is the script. It is impossible to believe that Wayne, Nelson and Martin can walk around so carelessly in a town supposedly under siege from Burdette, a criminal seeking to remove his brother from jail, together with his band of henchmen. And that finale with Wayne and Martin shooting sticks of dynamite in the air really made me suspend all my disbelief, fun as it was to watch...In the final analysis, RIO BRAVO is good fun, and its self-deprecating humor is its loftiest quality, along with a terrific soundtrack, the cherry of which is the duet by Martin and Nelson - both great singers, then at the top of their considerable crooning powers.Definitely must-see if you like Westerns.",Rio Bravo

The scene where he and Ricky Nelson go at it with the guitar and harmonica accompaniment is amazing. It made every hair on my arm stand up.""Rio Bravo"" is a happy, funny, feel-good Hollywood western. I liked it more than I liked ""Red River"" because it makes no bones about being 'Hollywood.' It takes pride in the colorful costumes, the cheeseball comedy and the light-hearted dialog. There is no great violence here. I'd say a kid could watch this one no problem.Normally, I don't like these kind of westerns, but this one left a good taste in my mouth.

89,ozthegreatat42330,"Always Bigger than life, John Wayne at his finest here.",10,27 May 2007,"Director Howard Hawks was one of those directors that worked well with John Wayne, and was far better than Hollywood ever gave him credit for. By Hawks' own feeling, he did a better job with ""El Dorado,"" a later remake of this film, but this was very much quintessential Hawks and Wayne at their best. It also began to set the habit of John Wayne using popular young entertainers in their early acting roles, as well as beginning to build the second tier of his stable of screen regulars. Dean Martin is excellent as the recovering drunk ""Dude."" You really feel his struggle to get over his alcoholism in the course of this film. And Walter Brennan as ""Stumpy"" was as always great. Another excellent actor in this film, aside from Ward Bond, a regular in 22 of John Wayne's films (this was their final parring) was John Russell as Nathan Burdette. Russell would later be seen in Clint Eastwood's film ""Pale Rider"" in 1984. And finally is Claude Akins, who just makes you hate him in this picture. As westerns go, this is often cited as one of the very best. Also a good beginning for the career of Angie Dickinson.",Rio Bravo
90,jackasstrange,500th film watched: Rio Bravo,9,15 November 2013,"Rio Bravo is perhaps the finest work of director Howard Hawks, and also one of Wayne's very best films. It was made as a response to High Noon, which is sometimes thought to be an allegory for blacklisting in Hollywood, as well as a critique of McCarthyism. Wayne would later call High Noon ""un-American"" and say he did not regret helping run the writer, Carl Foreman, out of the country. Wayne teamed up with director Howard Hawks to tell the story his way. In Rio Bravo, Chance is surrounded by allies - allegorical representations of countries.But over all the deep content that it has, that may be worth of various re-watches, it is an excellent film telling a somewhat entertaining story about a sheriff keeping in jail a bandit, brother of the bandit leader. Although, the allegorical part really plays big in this film.The cinematography is as well very good. Exteriors for the film were shot at Old Tucson Studios, just outside Tucson, Arizona. Filming took place in the summer of 1958, and the movie's credits give 1958 as the year of production, although the film would not be released until 1959.A curious fact about the film is the addition of two singers(Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson) for the important supporting roles in the film. They later do music just a few moments before the great climax of the film.So, yeah. Rio Bravo is really a very good film, and it's somewhat better than it's remake El Dorado.

91,januszlvii,Angie,10,15 June 2020,"I have read a number of reviews of Rio Bravo, but one thing that has not been evaluated is the performance of Angie Dickinson ( Feathers)., who reminds me of Lauren Bacall ( even the voice) in this movie. I think she ( along with Walter Brennan as Stumpy) steals the picture. Here is something;':. It is a fact about John Wayne, that after he became a star, very few women got the best of him: They were Claudette Colbert, Gail Russell, Jean Arthur, Capucine, Elsa Martinelli and Angie. Feathers wins over John T. Chance ( Wayne) by proving him wrong when he thinks she is a card cheat, and by doing what is necessary for him. How: Sleeping in a chair outside his door so he can sleep and she was going to take on gunmen holding him hostage until Colorado ( Ricky Nelson) had her throw out a flower pot to distract them. It was her willingness to go save Chance that inspired Colorado. Spoilers ahead: The final scene with her in tights was classic, with Chance saying ""He will arrest her"" if she goes out in public and finally admits that he will be the only one to see her in the tights. Her response was about making him talk as she said ""You will have to."" She knew then they were getting married. It is interesting that of all the women on that list the only one who changed him more was Russell in 'Angel And The Bad Man' I know everyone in Rio Bravo is great ( especially Brennan), and it is an easy 10/10 classic but watch the scenes with Feathers they are the best in the movie.",Rio Bravo
92,disinterested_spectator,A Movie That Invites Many Comparisons,7,4 January 2015,"It is almost impossible to talk about this movie without talking about other movies as well. First, there are the comparisons to other movies previously directed or produced by Howard Hawks, such as ""To Have and Have Not"" (1944) and ""The Thing from Another World"" (1951); as well as two of his subsequent Westerns, ""El Dorado"" (1966) and ""Rio Lobo"" (1970), each of which also stars John Wayne.Then there is ""High Noon"" (1952), which Hawks disliked so much on account of the way Marshall Kane (Gary Cooper) goes around asking ordinary citizens for help and finally has to be saved by his Quaker wife that he made ""Rio Bravo"" in response, in which Sheriff Chance only wants professionals to help him. But whereas ""High Noon"" is grim, ""Rio Bravo"" is lighthearted, with many scenes played for laughs, and with a scene in which the good guys sing a couple of cute songs. Had Hawks not explicitly made the comparison of his movie to ""High Noon,"" I would never have noticed, for the plot is quite different as well.Then there is ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence"" (1962), directed by John Ford, who apparently did not approve of what happened in ""Rio Bravo."" In ""Rio Bravo,"" the humiliating spittoon scene in the beginning leads to someone getting shot; in ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence,"" when Valence (Lee Marvin) trips Stoddard (James Stewart), which leads to a confrontation with Doniphon (John Wayne), Stoddard defuses the situation and nothing bad happens.Then there is ""Assault on Precinct 13"" (1976), which has a similar story, although it is not a western.Then there is ""A Fistful of Dollars"" (1964). Director Sergio Leone told composer Ennio Morricone that he wanted the music in his movie to be like the ""Deguello"" played in ""Rio Bravo.""That much I learned from reading reviews of film critics. But one comparison that occurs to me is ""North to Alaska"" (1960), also starring John Wayne, but, more importantly, starring Fabian. Fabian is a rock 'n' roll singer like Ricky Nelson, but a much better actor. I would have preferred to have him cast as Colorado in ""Rio Bravo,"" and he could have sung along with Dean Martin.Another performance in the movie that I did not care for was that of Angie Dickenson as Feathers. If ""Rio Bravo"" were the only movie I had ever seen her in, I would think she was a bad actress. But her acting in other movies is fine, so the fault must be with the role that was handed to her. It comes across as forced and artificial. In fact, now that I think about it, maybe Ricky Nelson was not to blame for his performance as Colorado either.Despite these weak performances, and despite a weak plot that does not always make sense, it nevertheless all adds up to a pretty good movie. It's not as good as ""High Noon"" though.",Rio Bravo
93,renegadeviking-271-528568,The film was made as a response to High Noon,8,12 January 2020,"Rio Bravo is a 1959 American Western film directed by Howard Hawks and starring John Wayne, Dean Martin, and Ricky Nelson. The supporting cast includes Angie Dickinson, Walter Brennan, and Ward Bond. The script was written by Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett, based on a short story by B.H. McCampbell.In short, the film is about a small-town sheriff (John Wayne) in the American West enlisting the help of a cripple (Walter Brennan), a drunk (Dean Martin), and a young gunfighter (Ricky Nelson) in his efforts to hold in jail the brother (Claude Akins) of the local bad guy (John Russell).The film was made as a response to High Noon, which is sometimes thought to be an allegory for blacklisting in Hollywood, as well as a critique of McCarthyism. Wayne would later call High Noon ""un-American"" and say he did not regret helping run the writer, Carl Foreman, out of the country. Wayne teamed up with director Howard Hawks to tell the story his way. In Rio Bravo, Chance is surrounded by allies - a deputy recovering from alcoholism (Dude), a young untried gunfighter (Colorado), a limping ""crippled"" old man (Stumpy), a Mexican innkeeper (Carlos), his wife (Consuela), and an attractive young woman (Feathers) - and repeatedly turns down aid from anyone he doesn't think is capable of helping him, though in the final shootout they come to help him anyway. ""Who'll turn up next?"" Wayne asks amid the gunfire, to which Colorado replies: ""Maybe the girl with another flower pot.""No matter where you stand on the political aspects of the film, it is a great example of both Hawks and Wayne doing what they do best. Hawks made some of the most entertaining films of the 1930s and 40s, including Only Angels Have Wings, Bringing Up Baby, and To Have And Have Not, and he had a style of his own that is often unappreciated for its simplicity. Never a fan of the close-up, he preferred shots where the relationships between the characters and the locations were highlighted. Rio Bravo shows us actors framed in windows or doorways, so we see them in a wider setting and build up our own sense of the geography of the small town - the saloon, the jailhouse, the long dark street that connects them. These shots establish the action so well; we know that there is nowhere to run when the showdown starts.""Sorry don't get it done, Dude. That's the second time you hit me. Don't ever do it again.""The characters are also a great strength of the film. John Wayne never looked particularly sexy, but Angie Dickinson works so hard as Feathers, the smitten love-interest, that you buy it. Wayne's character, John T Chance, looks poleaxed by her attentions, which gives him a charm that sometimes eluded him. There are other great performances, particularly from Dean Martin as Dude, the drunk who has to sober up, and Ricky Nelson as Colorado, the young gunslinger.StyleHawks was versatile as a director, filming comedies, dramas, gangster films, science fiction, film noir, and Westerns. Hawks's own functional definition of what constitutes a ""good movie"" is revealing of his no-nonsense style: ""Three great scenes, no bad ones."" Hawks also defined a good director as ""someone who doesn't annoy you"".While Hawks was not sympathetic to feminism, he popularized the Hawksian woman archetype, which has been cited as a prototype of the post-feminist movement.Orson Welles in an interview with Peter Bogdanovich said of Howard Hawks in comparison to John Ford ""Hawks is great prose; Ford is poetry"".Despite Hawks work in a variety of Hollywood genres he still retained an independent sensibility. Film critic David Thomson wrote of Hawks in The New Biographical Dictionary of Film ""Far from being the meek purveyor of Hollywood forms, he always chose to turn them upside down, To Have and Have Not and The Big Sleep, ostensibly an adventure and a thriller, are really love stories. Rio Bravo, apparently a Western - everyone wears a cowboy hat - is a comedy conversation piece. The ostensible comedies are shot through with exposed emotions, with the subtlest views of the sex war, and with a wry acknowledgment of the incompatibility of men and women."" As David Boxwell states ""It's a body of work that has been accused of ahistorical and adolescent escapism, but Hawks' fans rejoice in his oeuvre's remarkable avoidance of Hollywood's religiosity, bathos, flag-waving, and sentimentality.His directorial style and the use of natural, conversational dialogue in his films were cited a major influence on many noted filmmakers, including Robert Altman, John Carpenter, and Quentin Tarantino. His work is admired by many notable directors including Peter Bogdanovich, Martin Scorsese, François Truffaut, Michael Mann and Jacques Rivette.Although his work was not initially taken seriously by British critics of the Sight and Sound circle, he was venerated by French critics associated with Cahiers du cinéma, who intellectualized his work in a way Hawks himself was moderately amused by, and he was also admired by more independent British writers such as Robin Wood. Wood named the Hawks-directed Rio Bravo as his top film of all time.",Rio Bravo

95,ragosaal,Against Most opinions,4,2 September 2006,"I have read the user's comments about Rio Bravo. Frankly I can't understand how is it possible that most of them say this is a ""Masterpiece"" or ""Hawk's Best"" or ""Great Movie"" or ""Still One of the Best"" and a lot of similar opinions.The story is rather interesting and could have done a great movie, but it has so many terrible flaws that turns into a B western (and that being generous). Lets see:1) John Wayne is always John Wayne. He doesn't really act (except perhaps in his two best westerns ""Stagecoach"" and ""The Shootist"") both really good. 2) Sheriff John T. Chance looks always as if he knew the script is on his side and he'll come out well no matter what. 3) Ricky Nelson looks exactly like a comic magazine cowboy, totally out of place and surely someone told him about the happy ending too. And we also are forced to listen to his singing! 4) The movie is too long and with plenty of hard to believe sequences. 5) Most of all the final shooting that is really incredible and impossible. Wayne, Martin and Nelson engage in a shooting contest hitting small dynamite bars not only when static on the floor but moving rapidly through the air far from them. Wayne does it with a rifle (difficult enough) but Martin hits them with a six shooter without even aiming!! I can assure you also that dynamite bars don't blow off when hit by a bullet, a spark is always needed. The whole sequence is absolutely ridiculous, more proper of a ""spaghetti"" western and definitely sinks the film to the bottom.My 4 points rank for Rio Bravo comes out of acceptable setting and good performances by Angie Dickinson, Walter Brennan and Dean Martin (shortly after breaking his comedy partnership with Jerry Lewis). Fine music too. But that aside, nothing at all to match the great westerns of the 50's we enjoyed through the decade (High Noon, Shane, 3:10 to Yuma, Gunfight at OK Corral, The Gunfighter and so many others). In fact, I think Hawks himself realized the movie was really poor and spoiled, so he made ""El Dorado"" within a short period of time; though almost a remake of Rio Bravo and not a top western either El Dorado has not the terrible flaws and ridiculous sequences we saw in Rio Bravo and is a far better movie.Don't you agree?",Rio Bravo

I should have known better........except for the always entertaining Walter Brennan (""Stumpy""), this movie had nothing working for it. Dean Martin (""Dude"", in those days ?) did a very good job as the alcoholic-wreck-going-clean - but, many folk didn't know that Martin could act. Although others have praised his singing with guitar-playing Ricky Martin (""Colorado""), can't say much more than it was a break from the tedious 2-hour-20-minute drag.Characters were well developed - Angie Dickinson (""Feathers"") was completely miscast. ""Rio Bravo"" was a repudiation for ""High Noon""? I'm not familiar with that movie, but I'm wondering why. John Wayne (""Sheriff Chance"") truly played John Wayne, which was never hard to do. All of his later movies - as other people have noted - were profitable because of his large fan-base and choosing popular artists to draw-in their fans, too. Under-whelming.....I'm glad this type of movie was made for people who like to watch them. Although I do like western movies, this didn't do it for me....no story........sorry.....I hope Walter Brennan made good money and collected huge residuals for saving SO MANY westerns......",Rio Bravo
97,frank4122,"""It's hard to make a good western without John Wayne""",10,1 February 2020,"Rio Bravo is one the Duke's numerous great achievements. He showed a range of emotions, friendhship, love, rage, and great loyalty toward the friends he loved. With that said Howard Hawks masterfully directed a great cast of stars and stars in the making. Dean Martin was brilliant playing 'Dude', the lovelorn alchoholic haunted by his demons. Gonzales Gonzales' timing was impeccable with much needed comic relief. Angie Dickenson played well as the woman who just can't get John T. out of her head. Teen heartthrob Ricky Nelson provided just the right amount of tension as the cocky gunslinger out to avenge his boss, Ward Bond. I can't forget to add the best man to play hard-nose cops or sneering villains, Claude Akins. With all this, I would have to say Walter Brennen put on an acting clinic as Stumpy, as the cantankerous curmudgeon. This was one of the most endearing roles in movie history. I've seen Rio Bravo many times since my youth and it only gets better with age. Thank you Howard Hawks and John Wayne for a cinematic materpiece.",Rio Bravo
98,alfiefamily,Dean Martin steals this picture.,7,8 November 2003,"I must admit, before seeing Rio Bravo I could never understand how Dean Martin had a film career without Jerry Lewis. It seemed like he was sleep-walking through most of them (Matt Helm, 5 Card Stud, Ocean's Eleven). But I must say I was really impressed with his performance in this picture. I couldn't get enough of his character, ""Dude"". Troubled, drunken,down and almost out, Martin gives a wonderful multi-layered performance, without overplaying it. I feel that he gives the best performance of this movie.That's not to say that John Wayne and Walter Brennan don't measure up, because they do. It's just that by the time Rio Bravo was made, they both had already accumulated many superb performances in other pictures.Angie Dickinson and Ricky Nelson are also good in roles that are not quite as interesting. And of course it's always good to see Ward Bond.Not one of my favorite westerns (I still prefer ""The Searchers"") but I like what Hawks does in contrasting his film from ""High Noon"". It is said that Hawks hated that film because he did not believe that a law man would desperately try to find people to back him up. He believed that a real lawman would behave the way John T. Chance did. I also liked how much of the film takes place in the jail. You really get the feeling that their ability to move about the town were limited.A good, solid western drama. I give it 8 out of 10.",Rio Bravo
99,coop-16,Hawks' last masterpiece,10,16 April 1999,"Disregarded at the time of its release, and still underrated by many critics, Rio Bavo is finally coming into its own as a masterpiece. One reason that it has been underrated is that,it does not seem a typical western for the fifties. Most of the great westerns of the period were darker and moodier. Witness for example, the great films of Boetticher and Anthony Mann, or-the supreme example-The Searchers.Others were 'revisionist' and often sought to convey a socially conscious ""teaching'- High Noon is the paradigm here. In contrast, Rio Bravo is unashamedly reactionary. Hawks actually claimed to have made the film as a reply to High Noon..In addition, there are very few pyschological or moral ambiguities here. Instead, we get a classic Hawksian scenario, also found in Only Angels Have Wings and To Have and Have Not. . in which a groups of misfits and outsiders bands together to defeat  evil. Here we have John Wayne- offering a performance of considerable subtlety and self knowledge- as the valiant, yet limited, patriarchal hero, John T. Chance. To save the day, he calls on a cast of standard Western characters:The old-timer( Brennan), the reformed drunk( Martin), The ""kid'( Nelson), and the ""hooker with a heart of gold( Dickinson).Thanks to Hawks' assured, efficient, direction,All of these actors transcend the stereotypes usually associated with such characters to deliver fine performances which are simultaneously ""realistic' and archtypal. Particularly worthy of notice is Dean Martin. John Carpenter once claimed that the scene of Martin's ""redemption"" was the greatest moment in all of cinema. That may be an exaggeration, but Carpenter has a point. It is both moving and unforgettable.In short, Rio Bravo is a triumph for Howard Hawks and his seemingly artless art.",Rio Bravo
100,rhinocerosfive-1,"not since ""Johnny Guitar"" has the west felt so surreal",6,18 December 2007,"One of John Wayne's ""I'm gonna wear this red shirt again"" Westerns, a weird mixture of brutal, adult-oriented realism and Broadway sentiment.Dean Martin's drunken tough guy has a genuine friendship with John Wayne's John Wayne impression, and their relationship, as conveyed by the one of them who can act, is complex and rooted in true emotion. The bad guys are really awful killers. The town is appropriately dangerous and shabby. Certainly the violence is portrayed as shocking and terrible. But every once in a while Ricky and Dean start strummin', sometimes strollin' and singin' down the streets they've littered with corpses. It's strange.Hawks, though not young, could still direct, and he was old enough and in comfortable enough company to just sort of meander around and create some fun scenes without concerning himself overmuch with the big picture. As a result, we have Walter Brennan over the top as a bizarre and ancient incarnation of the gimp in ""Red River"", delivering himself of the corniest monologues of a long and corny career, juxtaposed with a grinning and sadistic Wayne knocking out a man's teeth with a rifle barrel.",Rio Bravo
101,Larry41OnEbay-2,The working title of the film was A BULL BY THE TAIL.,8,31 December 2009,"RIO BRAVO was both produced and directed by Howard Hawks. The working title of the film was A BULL BY THE TAIL. The screenplay was written by Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett and loosely based on a short story by B.H. McCampbell. Which is an inside joke B.H. McCampbell was Hawks' daughter Barbara. But according to Hawks, she only came up with the ending. Most of the story is by Leigh Brackett (THE BIG SLEEP & THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK) & what Hawks came up with while shooting. John Wayne had worked once before with Hawks, back in 1948 (RED RIVER.) Hawks wanted to make RIO BRAVO as a reaction to - HIGH NOON a complete inversion in every detail. Both movies unfold chronologically, but where HIGH NOON takes place in real time, RIO BRAVO sets a surprisingly leisurely pace telling a story spread across three days. Hawks said the only thing he did like about HIGH NOON was the music by Dimitri Tiomkin; but in contrast to HIGH NOON's ballad that only the audience could hear, RIO BRAVO's score included a trumpet dirge that weighs on the characters minds. The Hollywood Reporter review described composer Dimitri Tiomkin's scoring of a ""bullfight trumpet"" playing ""El Deguelo"" as ""one of the film's most vital elements of suspense."" Notice the great care with which the screenplay lays out its material -- in what is essentially a cinematic chess game. Every key character and plot element is introduced early along with the relationships that drive them, leading move after move to the violent end. The simple storyline has a sheriff take on, not 4 like in HIGH NOON, but 40 bad guys with some unexpected backup from the least likely characters - an alcoholic drifter, a crippled, elderly man, a naive young gunslinger, a dance-hall girl, and a hotel clerk. John Wayne was at the peak of his career in 1958 and Howard Hawks could not think of a better actor to play this lawman who embodied duty, decency, and integrity. It contains one of Wayne's best performances as Sheriff John T. Chance, playing what he himself called ""the John Wayne role."" He even wears the same hat, now battered and torn, that he had worn in Westerns ever since John Ford's ""STAGECOACH"" (1939). Much of the strength of the character comes from the way he holds himself in reserve, not feeling the need to comment on everything. When Dean Martin and Walter Brennan get in a loud argument, Hawks holds Wayne's character in the background, observing, not interfering. Wayne is always the unspoken source of authority, he is the audience the other characters hope to impress. Yet here he calls upon the role and his own history to bring nuance and depth to the character. Even grumpy old John Ford upon seeing John Wayne back in Howard Hawks' earlier western film ""RED RIVER,"" said of Wayne ""I never knew the big son of a bitch could act.""It has surprisingly warm romantic chemistry between Wayne and Angie Dickinson in her first major film role (she turned 78 on Sept. 30, 2009.) He never sweet-talks Dickinson's character and indeed tends to be gruff toward her, but his eyes and body language speak for him as he (and we too) fall for her. Actress Angie Dickinson's role was compared in several reviews to the role played by Lauren Bacall in another film directed by Hawks, TO HAVE AND HAVE NOT. Dickinson absolutely holds the screen against the big man. She's not a saloon floozy but a competent professional gambler accustomed to sparring with men. The film opens on Ward Bond, a wonderful character actor (his 22nd film with John Wayne) and his last major film role. Peter Bogdanovich praises the long opening sequence in ""Rio Bravo,"" which runs, nearly, five minutes without dialogue. Hawks said he wanted to get back to his silent film roots, where the tools of story telling with out dialogue pulled the audiences in much better than the pabulum of the masses called television which in the 1950s was killing the movies. Dean Martin was trying to prove he could make it on his own. Old Walter Brennan, as the peg-legged deputy, provides comic support. And, people forget he is one of only 3 actors to win three Oscars. In a lull in the action, the men relax inside the barricaded sheriff's office, and Martin, resting on his back with his hat shielding his eyes, begins to sing about a cowboy's loneliness. Nelson picks up his guitar and accompanies him. Then Ricky sings an uptempo song of his own, with Martin and even Brennan in harmony. Martin and Nelson were two of the most popular singers of the time, and the interlude functions well as an affectionate reprise for the men before the final showdown. RIO BRAVO was one of Wayne and Hawks's most successful and satisfying vehicles, which may help explain why they liked it so much and were so impressed with its potential for further exploration, that they remade it twice, once as EL DORADO and once as RIO LOBO.",Rio Bravo

That doesn't mean that all of the many Western movies starring Wayne are good (many of them are not good at all, sadly), but this is a true classic that I guess forever will be remembered as a great picture. It's good versus bad and no other crap to mess things up, and in a macho-like Western environment with Wayne in the lead things are just perfect. They managed to come up with a great plot and a solid selection of characters here, placing this movie in a spot above most other westerns. The rating from my hands is a solid 8 out of 10.",Rio Bravo
103,fredschaefer-406-623204,"The Essential John Wayne. and Howard Hawks, and Dean Martin.",9,5 September 2014,"John Wayne detested HIGH NOON and Howard Hawks thought even less of it, the sight of Sheriff Gary Cooper humbling himself by asking cowardly townspeople for help against a vicious outlaw seems to have deeply offended their concept of who and what constituted a hero in a Hollywood western. So like good Americans, they didn't just bitch and complain, they made their own movie and told the story their way, the result being RIO BRAVO, and the big winners were us movie buffs and western fanatics.The plot of RIO BRAVO is simplicity itself: Sheriff John T. Chance locks up brutal outlaw Joe Burdette (Claude Akins) on a murder charge and awaits the arrival of the Marshall in a few days. Nathan Burdette (John Russell), Joe' wealthy rancher brother, hires a gang of killers with the intention of freeing his brother, at the same time making sure the good citizens of Rio Bravo get the message that if they try to come to Chance's aid, it won't be pretty. Wayne's John T. Chance is a true professional, who does not bemoan his fate or beg for help, he stands for the rule of law and won't be intimidated, going about his job calmly and without without any outward fear. But the script (co-authored by Leigh Brackett) makes it very clear that as good as John T Chance. is, he does need help in this tight spot and gets from a most unlikely group: Walter Brennan's crippled old deputy, Stumpy; Ricky Nelson's young gunfighter, Colorado; Angie Dickinson's dance hall girl, Feathers; Pedro Gonzales Gonzales's hotel operator, Carlos; and most significantly, from Chance's alcoholic deputy, Dude, played by Dean Martin in what is surely his finest hour. This typical rag tag band of misfits come together for a common good, and prevail over the villains by being loyal to each other and exhibiting competence in a crisis, thus earning the respect of Chance and the esteem of the others. Courage is defined not as the absence of fear, but as the willingness to confront danger in spite of it. All of these are some of Hawks's favorite themes, thus making RIO BRAVO intensely personal while at the same time, deliberately commercial. There are great touches of humor and lots of great dialog, while each scene appears to be laid out with great care, especially the famous wordless opening in a saloon; the positioning of the actors, the laying out of the sets (mostly the dusty streets, the town's hotel and the jail) appear to have been done with an eye that knew how to tell a story visually. Few reviewers note how well the night time scenes are done.John T. Chance is probably the finest realization of a John Wayne hero in any film, a compliment from Chance is the highest honor a man could receive, and I think Wayne smiles more in this movie than any other, often at the antics of Brennan, in the kind of role he played better than any other. Martin's performance as Dude, a role originally offered to Montgomery Clift (who worked with Wayne, Brennan, and Hawks in RED RIVER), is a revelation; nothing much tops the scene where he pours the whiskey back in the bottle when the band starts to play the ""cutthroat"" song, which Santa Anna used in an attempt to frighten the defenders of the Alamo. Angie Dickinson's Feathers (with her stunning legs on display) has to give the sexiest performance of any of Wayne's leading ladies, we even get inside her bedroom, a rarity for westerns at the time. Many think Ricky Nelson was out of his depth in this movie and was cast only for box office appeal, but I think he more than holds his own. RIO BRAVO is the last pairing of old pals and frequent co-stars Wayne and Ward Bond.At two and a half hours, RIO BRAVO moves along very leisurely by modern standards; maybe Hawks should have copied HIGH NOON's tight pacing.In the end, I think HIGH NOON told us much about contemporary America and the degradation and corruption of civilization; while in RIO BRAVO, Wayne and Hawks give us the heroic myth of the Old West at its finest. Both films are equally valid in what they say and are enduring classics in their own right. Want to see how relevant RIO BRAVO is, go see GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY.",Rio Bravo
104,csm-78119,A western classic,10,29 January 2019,"Dean Martin steals the show as the drunken Deputy trying to regain his dignity and supported by Sheriff Wayne as the two men face impossible odds in trying to ensure that a killer is brought to justice. Gunslinger Nelson, old Deputy Brennan and showgirl Dickenson make up the team. Perfect performances all around with Brennan running Deano a close second with a magical turn as the old timer - a role imitated but never bettered in many films that followed. Tense, suspenseful and full of action but also laced with humour and the odd song from Deano and Ricky. What more could you ask for in a Western?",Rio Bravo
105,MichaelMRamey,A Gritty Take On Classic Westerns,8,1 November 2018,"Rio Bravo is simply about a small-town sheriff who arrests local bad guy's brother and only had the help of a drunk, a cripple and young gunfighter. John Wayne plays the sheriff in one of my favorite films of his. In fact Wayne had taken a break from the western genre for ten years before returning alongside two talented musicians in Dean Martin and Rickey Nelson. What do you do when you have two famous singers in a film together? You come up with one of my favorite scenes of the two singing together - guitar in hand - in the jail house.Putting their musical talents out of the question, the two hold their own with Dean Martin's portrayal of Dude; an alcoholic we join on his first day of sobriety. The once accurate two gun man is constantly questioning his ability to shoot with his shaky hands, but proves time and time again he is capable of getting the job done. We're introduced to Dude as he attempts to fish out a silver dollar from the spittoon on his hands and knees; only to be standing tall by films end. While Ricky Nelson's Colorado adds a much needed young gun to the aging dynamic of the group which apparently was role meant for Elvis Presley.I absolutely love this film and would put it as one of my favorite westerns of all time - probably just one notch below The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. It has the classic western tropes with a more gritty approach. The only thing that threw me off a bit was the romance between John T. Chance and the stunningly beautiful Angie Dickinson's Feathers. She is introduced as twenty-two years old while we're meant to assume Chance is in his late 40s, early 50s. I automatically assumed Feathers would end up with Colorado and when she started in on Chance I cringed a bit. I guess we can just chalk it up as; those were the times of the old west.This film is widely considered director Howard Hawks' final masterpiece after a long career. He is able to place you in the character's shoes while watching; feeling the edge the town is on throughout. The character's are meant to feel larger than life on the smaller built set; a creative choice by Hawks that worked. If you haven't seen this film I'd highly recommend it because just for the actors alone it is a time capsule of the 1950s and a classic western that is sure to entertain.",Rio Bravo
106,g-89622,A Western classic,8,5 October 2021,"A Western classic, the structure is complete, especially the last gun battle scene of the exchange of hostages is realistic and exciting, and the characters are thick and thin.

107,theognis-80821,"Cowardly, intellectually vapid weakness",2,8 May 2021,"This movie was made for the weakest reason for making a movie imaginable: lingering, bitter, skulking resentment towards a much better, more powerful movie. In 1952, ""High Noon,"" one of the greatest--if not the greatest--westerns ever made was a smash hit. A brilliant story, told in real time, of a man of uncommon integrity and valor, ""High Noon"" is, by any measure, a classic, made by several people who were blacklisted by cowards of the John Wayne ilk. So, instead of a story of a man of high principles, called by circumstance, to stand on them, we're given a tale of a lawman, surrounded and assisted by buddies. Especially awful is the not very subtle misogyny which mars Howard Hawks' version: ""High Noon"" presents several strong-minded, mature women; Rio Bravo offers a quivering, quaking mess, who calls herself an ""idiot,"" mysteriously falling in love with the aging, hulking Duke. In ""High Noon,"" the May-December romance is explained by having been preceded by lengthy correspondence and they do have their troubles. But Angie Dickinson simply melts merely at the first sight of John Wayne. Hollywood powerhouses from Harry Cohn to Harvey Weinstein have needed to feel that they are irresistible to young women: indeed, Howard Hawks married Dee Hartford, when he was 56 and she was 24. In ""Rio Bravo,"" Angie Dickinson--a Dee Hartford look-alike--at 27, swoons at the first sight of John Wayne, aged 51. This must be a popular yarn for the moguls of Hollywood, but it's not so plausible for most moviegoers. Most of the actors are very professional, but tepid ""teen idol"" Ricky Nelson sticks out like a sore thumb. Walter Brennan is cast as the obligatory cantankerous codger ""sidekick,"" a role which Gabby Hayes pioneered so well. There's no shortage of corn in a Howard Hawks western, but the cowboy crooning is greatly inferior to veteran cowboy singer/actor Tex Ritter in ""High Noon."" When you have nothing to say, it's easy to say nothing: the flat staging and setups are nothing compared to Fred Zinnemann's and Floyd Crosby's excellent craftsmanship. Ironically, Hawks' and Wayne's opinion that Will Kane in ""High Noon"" would not have been betrayed by the good folks of Hadleyville is challenged by history: according to Jeff Guinn's fine book, ""The Last Gunfight,"" Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday stood trial for murder following the gunfight at the OK Corral. So ""High Noon"" makes more sense than Howard Hawks' schmaltz. Sadly, this picture is pivotal in film history and criticism.",Rio Bravo
108,joelgodinho,"""You want that gun, pick it up, I wish you would""",9,31 May 2020,"Rio Bravo is a 1959 Western directed by Howard Hawks and starring John Wayne, Dean Martin and Angie Dickinson. Overall I'm not a big fan of the Western genre itself but some of my favourite films of all time are Westerns and my favourite Western (and one of my favourite films ever) is Rio Bravo, the main reason is without a doubt the performances, they are phenomenal and so likeable and the chemistry of the group is so great that after the movie ends I just want to spend more time with Dude, Stumpy, Colorado and the Sheriff. The story is interesting and while the moments of action are fewer then in most Westerns I really like each one of them, but even without much action the film is still very entertaing and funny because of the interactions of these great characters, in fact my favourite scene might be when the group is just relaxing and singing.
Overall, the film is probably not quite the greatest Western of all time but it's surely a runner-up for that spot and the most entertaining movie of the genre that I've watched.

110,gcrokus,Duke Doing What H Does Best,7,6 May 2009,"Of all the westerns John Wayne made, some of his later work was pretty high on the entertainment scale, but not necessarily having much substance. ""Rio Bravo"" may be the best example of the Duke standing vigourously, surrounded by a group of likable cronies, against the odds. I say standing because that is all that was required of him by this point in his career, and that is almost exactly what we see.As to the story, Sheriff John Chance (Wayne) has the task of seeing a murder suspect – well, not really much of a suspect, we see him do it – is held until a trial can be held. His accomplices are Dude (Dean Martin), a souse that was once a solid citizen and handy with a gun; a rookie called Colorado (Ricky Nelson) who is quick on the draw and coolly capable; an old-timer going by the name of Stumpy (Walter Brennan) and what seems an afterthought, the stage passenger that stayed in town – Feathers (Angie Dickinson).The trials and tribulations this ensemble sallies against is formidable. The prisoner is the brother of a powerful local rancher, so there is every possibility of an abetted escape attempt. To that end hired guns begin to cause mayhem in town, so there is never a peaceful moment.This is all western fun at its best. No one would expect high art here, but there is plenty of action (not compared to the latest chase movies, honest) but there is a story that one want to see through.I have heard and read that this movie was Howard Hawks' answer to ""High Noon"". There is much documentation to the effect that Wayne hated ""High Noon"" as well. Well, I like this movie much better than the overrated ""High Noon"" - there's are an awful lot of uneventful moments with only some pretty good action at the end. At least in ""Rio Bravo"" situations occur with some regularity.At this point in his career Wayne was commanding big salaries and darned if he didn't deserve it. His mere presence was box office gold, and the studios knew it. The Duke worked quite hard to preserve his image and this is another example of how he carefully nurtured ""the brand"" – he may even have been king of the G-rated movies.Three Stars.",Rio Bravo

Apart from an excellent, well told story, great action sequences, and great cinematography, it also has a human story with some character development, with Dean Martin playing a drunk struggling to put himself back together, and John Wayne playing a sheriff forced to honorably do his duty, a la Gary Cooper in ""High Noon"", although this movie is intended to be the opposite of ""High Noon"" in almost every respect.  At over two hours long, it is slow paced, but that allows the characters and the story to unfold well.  One of the finest westerns ever made, and one of Hawks' best films.",Rio Bravo

113,doug-balch,"Good John Wayne Western, a bit overrated",6,22 September 2010,"Rio Bravo is a movie that has been gushed over by numerous critics (Roger Ebert's review is particularly unctuous). Frankly, I don't really get it. I thought it was a really good movie and gave it 6 out of 10 in IMDb, which is a good score for me. It also scored well in my ranking system with 14 points, but for my money it doesn't belong in the conversation of ""best Western of all time"". Here's what I liked: Obviously, Hawks is a great director. He's at his best here at the interplay between the characters, especially Chance and Dude. Stumpy and his relationship to everyone is well drawn also, as are Feathers and Colorado. You've got to like the names of all the characters too, right? Chance, Dude, Stumpy, Feathers, Colorado. Great stuff. Really cool use of the haunting trumpet in the Mexican ""Cutthroat Song"", which Burdette orders the band to play in order to harass Chance. One of Wayne's better roles, which is saying a lot. Dean Martin is fantastic in this. There's an interesting story about how Hawks cast Martin, if you can dig it up. Scored well in my Mexico/Indian/Civil War category with the well characterized Mexican hotel owners who come to Chance's aid. Also, town was well populated with Mexican characters, which was historically accurate. Good use of comic relief. Claude Akins was an effective heavy, although his brother, played by John Russell, could have been characterized a little better. Look for Russell as the henchman Stockburn in ""Pale Rider"" 25 years later. Nothing about his movie was really bad, I just have some minor complaints: I found Ricky Nelson very awkward in this. Too bad they couldn't get Elvis. That would have been really interesting. Once again the stunning age difference between Wayne and Dickinson undermined the romantic subplot. Nice effort by Dickinson, though. Could they have left that town set for just one minute? I guess claustrophobia was part of the theme. I hate claustrophobia Songs by Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson were horrible Does a stick of dynamite automatically explode when hit with a bullet? Not the best shootout at the end and the body count seemed a little on the high side.",Rio Bravo
114,daviddaphneredding,"pretty scenery, good acting, good lovin'",7,17 October 2012,"Though this typical a la John Wayne western classic was a bit too long, it wasn't at all boring. John Wayne is his characteristically rough self, caring but rough-hewn as always in this movie who story line is simple: A spoiled outlaw (even at circa thirty years of age) is arrested for murder, and his older rich brother comes to the small Texas town of Rio Bravo to get him out: naturally, he brings his own hired guns to help him accomplish his purpose. Nothing but chaos ensues: there are a few gunfights and a dynamite explosion. The cast was somewhat stellar: again, Wayne was his rough self, Dean Martin (as Robert Mitchum did in El Dorado) posed well as a pathetic drunk who did sober himself up, Angie Dickinson was a very pretty unhappy lady, Rick Nelson was a baby-faced yet very brave deputy, Ward Bond too was his typical rough, boisterous self. Claude Akins performed very well a spoiled,mean outlaw, John Russell acted well in his role as the cold, crooked brother of Claude Akins. The town was pretty though very rough-looking; though Rio Bravo was actually a Texas town, the movie was actually filmed in Arizona at the Old Tuscon movie sight, as were many other classic westerns. Though, again it was long, the movie was not a sleeper. The well-known Howard Hawks was his same excellent director self, and Dimitri Tiomkin, who practically set a standard for directing music, was still very capable in this movie.

115,zolaaar,A Study of Men,10,24 May 2007,"A simple case: The good have arrested a bad and entrench themselves in the prison. The to and from is unimportant - what counts is this very moment where the time seems to stand still: four men in a room who are sitting together and sleek their wounds. And they act as if there's nothing more important than their mankind. And then they sing a song which is called ""My Pony, My Rifle and Me"" all right, but - of course - tells from the desire to spend some quiet minutes with a ""sweet girl companion"". In a certain way, this is the natural distance which Hollywood has put between men and women. First, there are the men, then there's the desire - and finally the women take their place who actually and undoubtedly hold the reins. This is the story that always swirls through the minds of men - and sometimes has to be cryptically sung out loud - about the better, invisible half of the story of Rio Bravo. Here, we see Dude (Dean Martin) who had an unpleasant experience with a woman; Chance (John Wayne) who is close to have one in the future; Stumpy (Walter Brennan) who is too old for such things and Colorado (Ricky Nelson) who is still too young. Those are four good reasons for limiting the contact with women to a song which circles around horses and rifles, but actually means That.So, the second, visible half of the story tells from four men in a room - and it would have been only half as beautiful without the short screen offs between the cuts. It is about friendship, responsibility, alcohol and all the things that men just have to worry with. Dude started drinking - they say, because of a woman - and therefor is not the old one anymore. His old friend Chance watched this for too long now, and decided at one point that this man is beyond help. That's why he puts his trust into the young newbie Colorado and wants him to be his next deputy. From now on, Chance finds, Dude can drink as much as he wants - he doesn't care anymore. But exactly this wins Dude over to stop and to pour the whisky in the glass back into the bottle - without spilling one drop. He says that a Mexican tune has brought him back to life, but it was, of course, Chance who said that the boy is at least as good as Dude. Anyway, the old Stumpy becomes so deranged from this whirl that he indulges in taking a big slug.Screen off.The four men are still surrounded by the bad guys, but no situation is as serious when a song at the right time can provide some comfort. Dude lies on a slapstick with the hat moved deep down his face and a cigarette in his mouth when he starts singing while Colorado sets in the guitar to ""My Pony, My Rifle and Me"". Stumpy obviously has his fun and Chance grins pleasantly. Now, Colorado sings his part and Dude whistles to it. And afterwards, they throw in ""Get Along Home, Cindy, Cindy"" which Stumpy knows as well and lilts with them. And Chance, drinking his coffee out of a dented metal cup, puts on his most fatherly face. Before, the world was in pieces, but now, everything is put together again. From now on, you know that nothing can go wrong anymore. One song is enough, nothing else needed. There is no fairer solution cinema has to offer.",Rio Bravo
116,Mike_Yike,"A Solid ""Wayne"" Western",7,9 November 2021,"I've seen Rio Bravo two or three times. It is a well above average western. It is more ""adult"" than the typical western of the period. The dialogue makes it a cut above the routine. Wayne is good in the lead. Radiant Angie Dickenson makes for a good love interest in one of her earlier films. Dean Martin is well-cast as the recovering drunk/deputy. And Walter Brennan is perfect as the old coot/deputy. The bit of casting that mystifies me every time I watch Rio Bravo is Ricky Nelson as Colorado Ryan, the young, honest gun hand. Why in the world Ricky Nelson? I could think of four or five better even if there is some insistence that the character must be young. I realize this is the epitome of hindsight but how about Clint Eastwood in the part? Paul Newman maybe. Were Vic Morrow or Ben Gazzara considered? Okay, I'll stop.The only other problem some might have is Angie Dickenson's romantic chase of John Wayne. There is nearly 30 year age gap between the two. I am now ""older"" so that is not so I much a complaint as an observation. Anyway, if you are a fan of 1950s westerns, Rio Bravo is pretty solid.

The only time they even go outside the jail is to take a quick patrol and then its back to talking. Another complaint is the decision to stick 2 popular musicians in a western and expect us to take it seriously. I have a feeling Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson were chosen just for their duet we get to hear them sing. So why watch it? Well it's one of the most beloved and popular John Wayne westerns all time.

And we need to make sure that it takes up a lot of time in the bloated 140 minute production. Because nothing screams 'great western' like an unnecessary, unconvincing romance! Heck yeah we need that!""""Let's see, what else....we should get some young musician who can't act very well and stick him in the film. And have him sing a song or two, songs that don't sound very vintage to the 19th century old west. This is a MUST to make a great western!""""Hmm...and let's have some comic relief. Let's have this old guy walk around and complain and gripe about everything under the sun, because that's funny, right? And let's make his voice so annoying that it grates on your nerves, to the point where you're hoping somebody, anybody, kills this character off. Gotta have that or it's not a great western.""""The plot has to be inanely stupid. The bad guys are all around town but they don't do very much. They just watch you. They are willing to kill the good guys sometimes, but other times they just stand around and watch. Until the end of the film, then they are willing to kill the good guys again. We need to drag this out for a long time because our film is going to be really long and really slow and have as little action as possible until the last 20 minutes. This will make a great western.""I could go on, but the point is made. A film with this many negatives simply cannot be great, despite what others might say. Rio Bravo is pretty weak all things considered. When I am in the mood for a western, I will never, EVER think of watching this again.6/10. Extremely slow-burn of an 'action' film that is little more than mediocre or average.

121,latsblaster,Rio Bravo: Nothing can tear 'em apart!,9,29 April 2003,"'Rio Bravo' is directed and produced by one of the best Hollywood-directors ever - Howard Hawks. After an opening scene that feels a bit dated, 'Rio Bravo' feels modern even if Hawks at times uses Dimitri Tiompkins music too much. Dean Martin and very young Ricky Nielsen are brutal with two revolvers each! Walter Brennan is the loyal and brave man, good and charming as usual. John Wayne is the natural leader and very trustworthy as sheriff.'Rio Bravo' is hardly slow, it is filled with action-packed and timeless gunfights. There are said that there are no close-ups in this film, but still some of it's style is inspiration for Sergio Leone's Westerns. And it is one of the most entertaining Westerns ever, with the rare ability to be booth funny, tough and exciting.The loyalty between the sheriff and the deputies are stronger than everything and in the end all four (Wayne, Nielsen, Martin and Brennan) wants, more than anything else, to be a part of the fellowship and then nothing can tear 'em apart!Rating: 9 of 10.",Rio Bravo
122,Laitue_Gonflable,Simple. Entertaining. Fun.,8,1 December 2003,"Here I go again, reviewing a generic western in my generic, western-reviewing way.Rio Bravo is another example of solid John Wayne western entertainment. It's basically good clean fun, with the badguys on one side wanting to spring one of their own from jail, and the Duke and a couple of sidekicks trying to stop them.What makes this film stand out as memorable is essentially the characters. Dean Martin is great as the main deputy recovering from a drunken spell and finding his knack for firing a gun again. Ricky Nelson has a smaller role as a determined young kid, and Walter Brennan is simply wonderful as the crotchety old man. The Duke is naturally a powerful presence on screen.These characters provide the entertainment, and there's plenty of action to help the film along the way as well. However, at two and a quarter hours, it is a little too long. There is a scene in the jail where Martin and Nelson show off their fine singing voices which is unnecessary to the plot. Similarly, the romance subplot between the Duke and Angie Dickenson doesn't exactly help the story along either. But then what kind of a western would this be without romance? A shorter one, sure, but also a lesser one. So basically it's as good as it can be, but with that quality also comes length. It seems to me as though that's the way it has to be.It's a good romp, definitely worth seeing once and enjoyed. Don't expect a masterpiece and you'll leave with a smile on your face. **** / *****",Rio Bravo
123,mts43,Not Nearly As Good As Its Reputation,7,15 August 2020,"Ricky Nelson couldn't act and was obviously too young for his role. The inclusion of music simply so he could sing and please teenagers in the audience was out of place and laughable. The romance between John Wayne and Angie Dickinson was unbelievable because of the obvious huge age difference. It was made even worse by Dickinson's poor acting. Then there is Walter Brennan's carried-away irritating performance that made me wish the bad guys would just shoot him and shut him up! Dean Martin, fairly early in his film career after years in films with Jerry Lewis where all he had to do was sing once in awhile while Lewis made a fool of himself, was surprisingly effective in his role. Howard Hawks basically remade the same plot two more times in ""El Dorado"" and ""Rio Lobo"". El Dorado, primarily because of Robert Mitchum's great performance, is the best of the three.",Rio Bravo
124,Tresix,HIGH NOON vs. RIO BRAVO; Round 2,8,28 September 2005,"They say that the best way to make a comment about a movie is to make a film of your own as a form of rebuttal. Both actor John Wayne and director Howard Hawks were not fans of the classic HIGH NOON: Wayne (who had been offered the part of Will Kane) felt that the movie was an un-American portrayal of the Old West while Hawks simply felt that Kane was a wimp for asking for help from the very people he was assigned to protect. That dislike led to the making of RIO BRAVO. Is it better than HIGH NOON? I don't think so, but it's still a good movie.RIO BRAVO stars Wayne as sheriff John T. Chance, who always totes his trusty Winchester rifle (because he doesn't feel as confident with a six-shooter). At the opening of the movie, Chance and his drunken deputy, Dude (Dean Martin), are bringing in outlaw Joe Burdette (Claude Akins). After Burdette's arrest, his brother, Nathan (John Russell), brings in his gang to bust him out by any means necessary. Meanwhile, cattleman Pat Wheeler (Ward Bond) comes into town and hears about Chance's problems. He offers his men as help, Chance refuses, feeling that they'd be no match for the professional guns hired by Burdette. However, when Wheeler is killed, one of his men, Colorado (Ricky Nelson), decides to help out Chance. It ends up being Chance, Dude (nicknamed ""Borachon"", Spanish for ""the drunken one), the gimpy Stumpy (the irrepressible Walter Brennan) and Colorado against the killers of the Burdette gang.Also thrown into this mix Feathers (Angie Dickinson), the woman who just may have sent Dude on a drinking spree. She's not a femme fatale but she is also no damsel-in-distress neither as she makes romantic overtures towards Chance. This leads Dude into getting captured by Burdette and sets things up for a big showdown that ends with a bang in more ways than one.The best performance in the movie, hands down, goes to Martin, who sort of dirty ups his ""lovable drunk"" image here. Nelson does well too as a fast draw. However, as comparisons to HIGH NOON come up, I find this film lacking: in the former film, the hero asks for help, doesn't get it and ends up standing alone. Here, the hero is offered help, refuses, but gets help nonetheless. The villains here aren't exactly given much screen time and what they have isn't utilized well. I had no idea why the Burdettes were supposed to be such bad men. The shootouts in both films are good for different reasons; HN's is more suspenseful while RB's is pure action. The women in both films are good, again, both for different reasons. I still like HIGH NOON more, but RIO BRAVO isn't a bad way to spend a night if you're in the mood for a good Western.",Rio Bravo
125,jcohen1,High Noon it's Not,7,1 March 2006,"Well I finally got to see this flick after having seen the remake (El Dorado) many times and having reviewed it previously. I like this movie for what it is, but those who call it a classic western or put it in the same league as High Noon are sorely mistaken. Rio Bravo is essentially the Rat Pack out west but with the Duke filling in for Frank. The Duke is never really in danger or seriously hurt. Okay, he trips down the stairs. The movie lacks a compelling villain since Claude Akins (pre- Movin On) is in jail most of the time. Ed Asner & Chris George were a great pair in ElD. Rickie Nelson as the youngest Rat gets to sing a few tunes and keep his hair puffed. He looks about old enough to shave. Dean Martin isn't bad but can't touch Robert Mitchum's performance in El Dorado. I love Walter Brennan and he's great moanin & groanin and rantin & ravin. Put him and Arthur Hunicutt (Bull from El Dorado) in a cell together and that would be something. There is lot's of sexual tension here provided by Angie Dickinson, but I'm sorry I don't believe she'd radiate it for a guy that old. The Maudie character played by Charline Holt was a more credible and still sensual mate for the Duke. I give the nod to James Caan as Mississippi over the younger Rickie Nelson - Colorado.If this was Hawks'/Waynes answer to High Noon than it's a weak reply. High Noon is a serious black & white look at a town's abandonment of it's sheriff who is in mortal danger. He's saddled with a wife and torn between staying and leaving. There's not a second of comedy in High Noon. John T Chance (Wayne) is a Lucky Chance with everybody he meets offering to help. This is not Western reality its Hollywood. Note that Sheb Wooley (High Noon) scenes in Rio Bravo were cut out.",Rio Bravo
126,NewInMunich,Perfect Counter to High Noon,9,13 August 2005,"It has often been said, that H. Hawks designed this movie to be the counter design to High Noon, featuring a retired Lawman desperately looking for help against an arriving group of gang men who have put an oath to go after him and going thru desperation and frustration, as the community he has fought for turns their backs on him and even his newly wed wife seems to turn her back on him. And all this stoically played down by Gary Cooper In Rio Bravo we see a sheriff relaxedly played by the Duke, even refusing help that is offered to him (also he often puts himself in dire need of it) and going against a strong number of hired thugs with only a cripple and a drunkard. And we see a sexy love interest in Angie Dickinson who relentless provides help by throwing flower pots and not by pretending to be a quaker and then shooting people from behind. All this played out over more then 150 minutes without a really dull moment. And without denouncing ""normal people"" as cowards refusing solidarity, much more as people having their hearts and minds right, even to the expense of their life, as we experience the first one looking for organized help being killed by a paid hand. All in all, certainly one of the Top 10 movies in the universe of Howard Hawks, 9 out of 10.",Rio Bravo
127,andrew-huggett,"Entertaining, standard western story",8,27 November 2012,The Duke and Dean Martin (who plays a hung-over drunkard) have to wait six days for the US Federal Marshal to arrive to collect a murderer while the baddies (led by the murderer's brother) essentially lay siege to the town  The character of Stumpy is great fun  as is Carlos (a sort of Mexican version of Manuel from Fawlty Towers!). Things move quite slowly and gunshots often happen off screen and reactions seem slow compared with later spaghetti westerns  however the film starts off well and includes a cold-blooded murder in the first few minutes (which was quite unexpected and brutal) – this then forms the basis of the whole film. There's a great scene where the sheriff and his deputy enter a saloon of baddies ... The ending is preceded by a couple of songs which fit reasonably well into the film – then there's quite a tense 'exchange' scene before the ending when the Duke gets the girl. All clean wholesome fun – and none of the good guys get killed ... Very good enjoyable standard big screen western – ideal for a rainy Sunday matinée.,Rio Bravo
128,philip-davies31,The persuasiveness of dynamite.,9,6 April 2020,"There are some on here - IMDB - determined to rubbish what they see as nothing but brainless Fascist propaganda. They're just desperate to boost the ideologically contrived Leftist western 'High Noon' (which is nevertheless a very fine film, of course, from it's own particular perspective). One reviewer here is even determined to puncture the grandeur of the final shoot-out in 'Rio Bravo', by asserting in authoritative tones that 'I can assure you also that dynamite bars don't blow off when hit by a bullet.'Well, sorry , but dynamite sticks - they're not bars - are in actual fact extremely unstable. This is a characteristic of dynamite that Hawks and his writers efficiently indicate when Chance yells at Stumpy to get away quickly from the wagon he has chosen as a firing position, as the old man hasn't realised what lurks under the tarpaulin covering: a load of dynamite. One stray bullet could send the old-timer sky-high! He makes a hasty hobble to vamoose, but suddenly runs back and staggers away with a large case of useful extra armaments.This of itself provides sufficient dramatic logic for the 'explosive-skeet-shooting' scene that finally disposes of the villains, and plausibility is helped along by means of the clear indication in close-ups that no fuses have yet been fitted to these sticks, so that Stumpy must be fully aware of an alternative method of detonation, And indeed he is, and the others quickly catch on. We are enabled to rapidly gather during this fast-developing but clearly motivated scene that an unusual and decisive turn of events is unfolding. From that structural perspective alone the 'dynamite can't be detonated by a bullet' view is exposed as not only irrelevant but just plain ignorant.Such a view is also ignorant of the laws of chemistry and physics which have for long forbidden the use of dynamite for military purposes, having regard to the fact of it's extreme instability in such an environment rendering it more dangerous to your side than to the enemy. Even the professional demolition and mining uses of dynamite are subject to the most demanding controls, for that reason.In any case, an action-man like Hawks would be extremely unlikely not to have direct experience, with his second-unit, of the management and cinematic possibilities of explosives!Really the only question the scene raises is regarding the prowess of the shooters present; but of course all of these characters are already introduced to us as men who are long experienced in trusting their lives to the hair-trigger speed and pin-point accuracy demanded to survive as a gunfighter in an often lawless West.Well you can call that prowess myth or legend or history, but being an incredible crack-shot remains as essential to the Western genre as levitating chinese fighters in kung-fu movies; and anyway Hawks has a sufficient eye for pleasingly humanising detail to show the ageing Chance needing a second shot before successfully detonating one of the sticks Stumpy throws towards the baddies' by now burning redoubt.In fact this terrific scene usefully encapsulates precisely why this film is so satisfying, and so admired: style, and superb technique. The final shoot-out is resolved like a celebratory firework display, a clever contrivance true to the artifice of the Western genre and providing a glorious resolution for the long-suffering characters.Hawks clinches his magnificent film with the persuasiveness of dynamite.",Rio Bravo
129,The_Other_Snowman,"The Rollin' Rio Bravo Rolls Along, and Along, and Along...",7,4 December 2011,"The Wikipedia entry for this film declares it a masterpiece. It's certainly a classic: Howard Hawks directed, John Wayne starred, Dmitri Tiomkin wrote the music, and Leigh Brackett (The Big Sleep) wrote the script. It delivers a classic Western scenario: a sheriff and his sidekicks facing down a town full of villainous henchmen while they await the arrival of a federal marshal. Quentin Tarrantino claims it's his favorite movie; John Carpenter likes it too, and his ""Assault on Precinct 13"" is just one of the films influenced by ""Rio Bravo"".John Wayne stars as the sheriff, John T. Chance, and his trusty Winchester costars. There's not much that can rile Chance, perhaps because Wayne had reached a point in his career when he wasn't expected to act. Dean Martin plays Dude (not THE Dude), a recovering drunkard, crooner, and former deputy. Ricky Nelson, who takes his emotive cues from Wayne, plays a young gunslinger (perhaps descended from Cherry Valance of ""Red River"") along for the ride. Walter Brennan plays himself, and Angie Dickenson plays a neurotic young woman who falls for Chance.There are occasional gunfights, and an explosive climax, most of which are incidental to the plot. The movie is so relaxed in its pacing, and the lead performances are so restrained, that there is hardly any real suspense or tension. The bad guys who pop up now and then fail to threaten our heroes, and they are quickly despatched. The main villain doesn't make much of an impact. On its surface, ""Rio Bravo"" is hardly comparable to other Western Classics like ""The Gunfighter"" or ""High Noon"". What makes the movie stand out, and perhaps what gives it classic status, is the easy rapport of its characters and the bantering dialogue that was Hawks' trademark. It was apparently a political response to ""High Noon"" -- a similar story told the ""right"" way -- but the movie is so chilled out that it's almost impossible to read any sort of political subtext into it. It's just a fun movie.",Rio Bravo
130,tomquick,Old Tucson Studios,7,18 January 2008,"Over all my years of watching movies, I'd never seen this. After visiting Old Tucson Studios I decided to watch a trilogy of movies made there: The Three Amigos, Tombstone and Rio Bravo. The preserved movie sets have more of the flavor of the first (and more recent) two, but the surrounding mountains, the blue sky and the forlorn desert are the same for all. If you're a movie fan and visiting Tucson, I'd recommend seeing this.I have some reservations about recommending Rio Bravo, though. As Americana, as a campy experience, OK, but not as a great movie. Who wrote this thing? It seemed for a while like it could have been the Grateful Dead, but they didn't come into existence for several years after it was made. Dean Martin and Walter Brennan (aka Stumpy) are great, in a substance-abused sort of way - particularly WB's incoherent cackling and babbling. But the rest of the cast appears to be sleepwalking their way through what measures out at a little over 2-1/2 hours length. With some cutting - let's just say this could have been a lot better. But Angie Dickinson is a bit too random, and John Wayne a bit too wooden to make this great.",Rio Bravo
131,Whythorne,"Heavy handed, predictable western from the Hawks mold",1,5 April 2010,"A lot of people revere this western and that's fine. It's just another one of those that I throw into my ""I don't get it"" file, especially given the high rating here at IMDb. Director Hawks was a master of the obvious. His films rarely have any surprises and this is no exception. You know as soon as you see ""Directed by Howard Hawks"" during the credits that every good guy will survive the story. You know John Wayne's character is in about as much danger of not making it as, say, James Bond in a 007 flick.Because of the lack of surprises, the story lacks any punch and is just another tepid bit of fluffy entertainment from the Howard Hawks mold...and he sure did like that mold. It's hard to keep this Western separate in my mind from ""El Dorado"" and ""Rio Lobo,"" as they all follow the same formulaic character ensemble story. Heck, it's hard to separate this in my mind from ""Hatari.""A couple of ""Dont's"" and ""Dos"": DON'T expect: anything subtle or nuanced, nice cinematography, in-depth character development or absorbing storyline. DO expect: hammy, over-the-top wooden acting, a complete lack of clever dialog, obvious plot lines, typical stage lighting and studio back lot sets.It's occurs to me that ""Rio Bravo"" is to Westerns what ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad Mad World"" is to comedies, and if that kind of broad and obvious treatment is your cup of sarsaparilla then you will no doubt savor this one.",Rio Bravo
132,kindtxgal,Not Exactly a Gallop in Pace...More Like a Pony Trot,7,20 June 2016,"Good film but way too long. I started getting really bored with the romance part of the movie -- it was an annoying interruption of great scenes & the plot and really didn't add much to it other than that --- annoyance. Subtract a couple of the parrying between Wayne & Dickinson's characters and the movie would have flowed better and not dragged on so much! Any viewer can see where the argumentative stuff between the two will lead to. Yawn. Ricky Nelson & Dean Martin clearly cast to show off their warbling capabilities...Martin was great, but missing some of his fire & panache from previous films. Nelson -- well, he's just sorta pretty to look at of course. Walter Brennan returns in a familiar casting role -- cantankerous, backtalking, usual role -- so I found that regrettably boring as well, since Brennan's range of acting far outreaches that particular typecasting. So, yeah. A typical Western that is quite dim in comparison to High Noon's plot.",Rio Bravo
133,clotblaster,Extremely well-made film with disparate characters and actors,9,6 May 2009,"Hawks, as has been pointed out by many viewers and professional critics, mixed an unlikely quintet of characters (other than Wayne and Brennan) into a very good movie, with strong character interactions and very strong screen performances by Martin, Wayne and Brennan. I also think Nelson was fine and think negative reviews of his performance don't match Hawks's expectations for this character and the actor who portrayed him. Meaning, Nelson isn't supposed to be a polished,powerful actor. Dickinson is also quite good and unfair comparisons to other actresses by a couple of critics are irrelevant, if not just plain wrong. (The movie is a conservative rejoinder to the left-wing, spineless High Noon. Cooper acted well, but the story made him seem weak and lacking in common sense, not to mention virility. Kelly had a thankless role which she made the best of. Only the community matters to Zinneman and the movie grossly overplays its hand by building suspense out of amateurs, naturally, not wanting to be involved in fighting outlaws.) Anyway, Rio Bravo has good plot, generally very good dialogue and great direction by Hawks.",Rio Bravo

The other two where good silver piece attempts but this one is the solid gold dollar piece;)141 minutes but the film is so enjoyable the time just fly's by it has the lot:
A small claustrophobic mini siege drama in a jail while also being an epic war of nerves with the army of gunmen that keep riding into town for 50$ gold piece.A great bunch of characters each with their moment especially a recovering drunk Dean Martin and a gloriously cantankerous Walter Brennan, the best parts I've seen either play.A gorgeous 20 something Angie Dickinson supply the Hawks leading lady who aint taking no crap from the tall man.And a John Wayne who seems so at ease in this part he doesn't seem to be acting, he just is the Sheriff John T.Admittedly It isn't perfect the comic relief Mexicans are painful to watch (neither believable nor funny) in their parts and the antagonist is barely in the film at all.But as the sparks fly between the main cast anyway (as Hawks intended) that doesn't detract any.Even the songs are okay as they sung then back to the fun.Don't worry there's plenty of action and an explosive final act.It's a toss-up, Rio Bravo or The Good the Bad and the Ugly as to my fav western.",Rio Bravo

Occasionally it rises to Hawks greatness. About ten minutes worth. The rest is just a waste of time, the actors going through some kind of horrible amateur motions. Nothing like a bunch of people from the actors studio throwing on some costumes and being themselves, I guess. However, the person here who spotted just how good Martin is in this is right: it is a wonderful performance. As for the rest of the bunch, well, right its New York, actors studio. This is not a western folks. For that try Red River. The greatest western ever made.

136,zacdawac,So Dean Martin actually could seriously method act!,6,29 September 2021,"Instead of the suave, easy going partier with a drink in his hand that pretty much defined Dean Martin, we see a serious alcoholic, complete with the shakes of withdrawal and the look of despondence. For Dean's performance, and for Walter Brennan at his most outrageous, Angie Dickinson at her most alluring and Rick Nelson in a rare film role, I give six stars. The dialogue is fun and entertaining so my rating also goes for that. As far as everything else---.The only thing that could differentiate one John Wayne character from another is his age at the time of the production. The later the film, the slower moving and the more crotchety the creature. This one was sometime between True Grit and his early thirties Grade B westerns, closer to the former. He was slightly aged and admittedly tired, but still able to rise for the cause when a beautiful woman, half his age, essentially threw herself at him. He's watchable but if you know anything about my politics, you have to assume that I'm not a huge fan. Every few years, I give one or two of John Wayne's reputed classics a chance. While I'm rarely repulsed, I'm not enthralled that often, either.A semi-crotchety aging sheriff, with limited and barely reliable assistance from a recovering drunk, an old man and a starry eyed young guitarist, decides to take on a gang of roughly forty armed, skilled, cold and ruthless professionals for the purpose of keeping one man in prison. It makes sense to me. Get yourself and your three best friends killed, or if you rely on the fact that you're the indestructible John Wayne, kill forty other people, for the sake of one prisoner. And who was the prisoner? Was he a notorious bank robber and mass murderer who was wanted in fifteen states? Actually, he was the brother of an affluent businessman, who killed one man in an old school western bar fight. Maybe it could have been called murder since the victim was said to be unarmed but was his prosecution worth the many lives it might ultimately cost? The shooter was a rich, well connected white man in Texas in the nineteenth century. Even in twenty first century Texas, a wealthy Caucasian in the same situation would likely be able to claim he was standing his ground and avoid prison. If he just shot someone in a bar, and no one had an abortion, I'd say his chances of walking free would be rather good.The film also takes far too long to get where it's going. The chase should have come ten minutes after the capture. The afore mentioned actors, John Wayne aside, keep us entertained through the lengthy ride, though.Recommended for Dean, Angie, Walter, Rick and the creative, interesting dialogue. And of course, I try to see everything that's considered a classic, even if it takes fifty years. If you expect anything but average John Wayne, then I'd say re-think your standards and enjoy.And did people really have guitars like that in the old west? If the film wasn't made in 1959, I'd have guessed that Rick's instrument came from the Woodstock era.",Rio Bravo
137,aakash-karkare,They don't make 'em like they used to,8,15 November 2010,"I know its a cliché to say that but sometimes it is all you can say. You watch movies like Rio Bravo and Casablanca and you just thing how the movies were made in a different era. They were filled with such joy and innocence and were so heartwarming, uplifting and enjoyable that you long for the era that has gone by.Rio Bravo stars John Wayne as John T. Chance a town sheriff who is trying to take on the big shot in town who has all the money. He has two deputies in the form of the Dude who was a drunkard but is now trying to become sober again and Stumpy played brilliantly by Walter Brennan. He played the character very well and I guess in the 148 minute runtime it was he who stood out the most. He was given a very endearing character to play and he made him even more endearing. Angie Dickinson is very beautiful and in every scene that she occupies you find yourself just lost in her face and she gives a good performance as the Sheriff's love interest.The movie begins with the Sheriff arresting the big shots brother and that sets off a series of events. The Sheriff refuses to release the brother and he has to keep fighting for. At first he refuses help and decides to go at it alone but slowly he realizes that everyone needs help and the town bands together at the end in a final shootout.Rio Bravo isn't like most westerns. It isn't the contemplative western and nor is the extremely violent western like The Wild Bunch. It is the 'Perfect Hangout Movie' as Tarantino calls it. Its about a bunch of guys hanging out and trying be happy and chilling out. Maybe it served as an inspiration for all those other movies. But somehow it retains a lot of enjoyment from watching the characters do their daily tasks and their interactions with each other.Rio Bravo was Directed expertly by an old master Howard Hawkes. The directors of America's golden age knew how to tell a story really well. They could keep you engaged in every aspect of the story and you wouldn't feel bored barring a few. Howard Hawkes is at the top of that list of directors.Rio Bravo is for a great afternoon's enjoyment.

Dean Martin gives the performance of a lifetime as Dude, an alcoholic whose struggle against his own demons forms the heart of the film.  Angie Dickinson is radiant and razor-sharp as Feathers, a cunning but warmhearted lady drifter (Wayne & Dickinson's scenes are absolutely priceless).  Ricky Nelson is instantly likable as the fresh-faced but streetwise Colorado (I LOVE that name!).  And, of course, Walter Brennan steals the show in a film made up of show-stealing performances as the infinitely cantankerous and chatty Stumpy.There's lots of great action and comedy here, but the part that had the deepest impact on me was the singing scene.  For some reason, it just really hit home for me--Martin and Nelson's soulful crooning, Stumpy's harmonica, and the Duke hanging back with a small, genuine smile on his face; all of them realizing that they may not live out the night, but thinking to themselves that life will have been worth it nonetheless.  It was that rare gem of a cinematic scene that feels completely real--where the emotions of the characters and the audience become one.  After watching it, you feel as if you were actually in that cramped, stuffy little jailhouse, whiling away the hours with these unlikely friends.

One of my favorite Duke flicks. And what I'm about to state will undoubtedly rub some folks the wrong way.. so be it. The only reason Dickinson made it in Hollywood was Frank Sinatra.. and a few other very close and personal acquaintances. Her acting was sub-par at best in any appearance.

142,tim777ca,Tired Hawks!,7,30 August 2002,"Hawks' anti-HIGH NOON western has interesting intention, but is terribly dated for its slow-moving tempo.We see lots of Wayne entering the hotel, walking up the stairs, marching in the hallway, knocking on the door, finally going into Angie's room to have little quarrels, not to mention how Hawks shows us how Wayne exits the hotel. It's easy to cut off 20 minutes footage and tighten the whole structure. What happened to the Hawks that made fast-moving comedy HIS GIRL FRIDAY (1940)? Apparently he was getting old and tired when making this movie.Wayne is in his usual bossy style; Martin good as alcoholic deputy sheriff; Brennan terrific as Wayne's side-kick; Ricky Nelson seems out of place as experienced gunslinger; Dickinson's role didn't help her career too much.",Rio Bravo
143,mr composer,One of the best John Wayne movies ever,10,25 August 2001,"Along with ""Stagecoach"" and ""The Quiet Man"", I rank this as the best motion picture to star John Wayne. There are plenty of other worthy westerns from the Duke, such as ""The Searchers"" and ""Red River"", but this one is seemingly the most electric of all his westerns. The acting from everyone is wonderful. The synopsis is simple - try to keep the bad guy with dangerous connections in jail until the marshal can get there. He has just a small handful of highly varied characters to help out. But this makes for a very captivating two hours plus some. Besides fun tension and great wit, this has some of the most enjoyable multiple-character developments of any film I can think of. I can highly recommend this, as you can hate westerns and still probably enjoy this movie.",Rio Bravo
144,iftikharkhokher,Rio Bravo(1959),9,2 September 2007,"Probably one of the best western of all times.The essence of the west,it nomenclature and very existence is extremely well produced here.John Wayne in his mettle,ageing but still the hero.Martin and Rick Nelson surprisingly give competent performances.Walter Brennen excellent.The film is so well acted the main characters seem like a close knitted family.The same can be said for the Burdette clan.The sets are convincing and well chosen.The weak point is the casting of Angie Dickinson,although she acted well.She is simply too young for Wayne.The long feminine vanities slow down the film and are out of place with a harsh environment.An older woman would have added more realism.The climax is tremendous with Wayne again in the apex.I rate this alongside 'Red River' as Wayne's most memorable film.Worth seeing again and again.",Rio Bravo
145,dan_pap,it's time for a cowboy to dream,7,7 July 2019,"""Every man should have a little taste of power before he's through.""Rio Bravo boasts a stellar cast in John Wayne, Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, and Angie Dickinson. It's a classic Western film that strays from themes related to the genre. Instead of the stereotypical outlaw vs. sheriff theme, Rio Bravo forces the audience to analyze each character and how their unique backstories explain their actions.One of Rio Bravo's defining features is that, unlike other Westerns, there isn't an overwhelming protagonist. Instead, each of the characters are seen grappling with their own issues and finding their place in the story.All four of our main characters are deputies in the town. John Wayne plays the sheriff and acts as the calm and steady voice of reason in the story. Dean Martin plays Dude, a has-been who delved into alcoholism after he was left by a woman. There's Stumpy, the crippled grandpa and a young, talented new guy. The interactions between all the other characters is quite interesting, especially the chemistry between Chance and Dude.Methodically speaking, this is a really good movie whether you like Westerns or not. The writing is really good, and the direction especially is remarkable. Each scene is intricately set up. I want to bring special attention to the opening scene. There's no dialogue, and we don't fully find out what transpired until later. The opening scene really pulled me in, and set this up to be a really solid film.Unfortunately, the run-time is a bit long. As the movie progresses, Feathers and Stumpy started really annoying me. There's a shootout scene that's really good, but the closing scene is anticlimactic and I wish the movie had ended better for the sake of the story.Despite all the praise I can offer Rio Bravo, I just don't think it warrants over a 7 rating. The scenes with Feathers are too drawn out, and I think we'd have a better story if her character was removed completely. Nonetheless, this is definitely a good Western to see if you appreciate character development, dramas, and John Wayne.",Rio Bravo
146,Slim-4,Leisurely paced Western classic with a great cast and excellent direction by Howard Hawks.,9,17 October 1999,"""Rio Bravo"" is Director Howard Hawks' reaction to ""High Noon"".  In the 1953 Academy Award winner Gary Cooper spends the first half of the movie trying to recruit help to fight four baddies.  Ultimately, he faces them alone.Hawks believed that Cooper's Marshal should never have expected help.  His Marshal (played by John Wayne) makes it clear from the beginning that he doesn't need help from ""well-meaning amateurs"".  He does get some help from a young gunman named Colorado (played by Rickie Nelson), but Colorado is a professional.The cast does a good job with the excellent script.  Angie Dickinson has a particularly strong part as John Wayne's romantic interest.  She plays her role with understated humor.  ""Whoever heard of a stagecoach with a bathtub?"", she asks in response to Wayne's question about why she isn't on the stage.  In another scene she helps Wayne by throwing a flower pot through a window.There is a strong supporting cast.  Wayne's helpers include Dean Martin and Walter Brennan.  Ward Bond is on board briefly in the early scenes of the movie.  John Russell does an adequate job as bad guy Nathan Burdett.Ricky Nelson's performance as Colorado is a disappointment.  This is one of the strongest parts in the movie and he blows it.  His performance is wooden and stands out as one of this film's few weaknesses.The pace of this film is leisurely. The tense buildup paced by Dimitri Tiomkin's music and the clock in ""High Noon"" is not there. Instead, the increase in tension is interspersed with light moments.  In one scene Martin takes a bath while Wayne and Dickinson chat outside.  Music plays an important part in pacing this film.  Dimitri Tiomkin scored this film, too. His ""Deguello"" underlines the increasing tension.  Colorado describes the tune as a ""Mexican song I heard further south.  The Mexicans played it for those boys at the Alamo"", he says.  The implication is clear.  There will be no quarter for Wayne and his companions.  In another scene the music helps define one of the film's lighter moments as Martin and Nelson sing.  The tune is familiar.  It is the title theme from ""Red River"" with lyrics.This Western worked so well that Director Hawks felt compelled to do it twice more.  ""El Dorado"" is a not very subtle copy of this film, and ""Rio Lobo"" borrows from it as well.""Rio Bravo"" is a pleasure to watch because of its good cast, script and pacing.  This is an outstanding production and Howard Hawks has seldom been better.  There is real chemistry at work here.  ""Rio Bravo"" is a landmark in Western films.",Rio Bravo
147,slothropgr,Yakkity Yak!,7,15 March 2014,"When I was teaching screen writing in Santa Fe I passed out copies of this gabfest's screenplay at the beginning of the ""Dialogue"" segment. Then at the end the test was to go through and edit out all the useless, superfluous or repetitive dialog. The most generous editing cut it down to about 120 minutes even, the most severe to 107 minutes. Soooo much gab, so much useless verbiage, especially from Angie Dickinson, who plays a typical Hawksian woman--a BLLAABBBERRMOUTHHH(to quote the great Ralph Kramden). Not that she was the only guilty party. Scene after scene that could be dealt with effectively in a couple of lines and a look or two (if you have the actors, and Hawks did) went on and on and ON! Even the Duke couldn't shut up! Sometimes he'd go on for 10 or even 15 words in a breath! No wonder Quentin Tarantino loves this movie so much! As a follow-up, I asked my students to justify Angie's presence in the picture, and they all agreed (even the girls) it was because of her legs, and (the more perceptive noted) she was replaying Lauren Bacall from ""To Have and Have Not"" who Hawks wanted but Bogie got. Wonder if he got Angie. I won't even go into the typical 50's Mann Act romance with Wayne. Angie was playing older than her 19 years, she could've been at least half the Duke's age. This was Hawks' answer to TV?",Rio Bravo
148,dnwalker,This movie has all the elements of the quintessential Western.,10,9 December 1999,"The story itself is a composite of all the elements needed to make a great Western:  good guys in white hats, bad guys in black hats, townspeople content to stand aside and to let the battle be fought between the outlaws and the man with the tin star, a beautiful woman to distract the hero and finally help him when the chips are down.The main stars, John Wayne, Dean Martin, and Angie Dickinson all turn in the top-notch performances one would expect from them, and Rick Nelson is a very pleasant surprise as Colorado.  It's two others that separate this movie from other Westerns, though.Pedro Gonzales-Gonzales, as Carlos the hotel-keeper, is a breath of fresh air.  His interplay with John Wayne's John T. Chance adds a touch of human reality to the movie that sets it apart.Walter Brennan in his role as Stumpy, however, is the glue that holds the whole thing together and makes it work.  His constant griping under his breath, his goading of Wayne, his dialogue with the prisoner and his general comic relief set Rio Bravo apart from any other Western and put it in a class of its own.  Keenan Wynn in Eldorado doesn't even come close.",Rio Bravo
149,matchettja,What am I missing?,7,8 July 2006,"Despite its classic status, this is not one of my favorite Westerns. I have my reasons. First of all, it's not really a Western. It can be and has been transposed to just about any era, anywhere in the world. Next, the story is absurdly simple. You have a small group standing off a much larger group trying to get their comrade out of captivity. That's about it. There isn't a whole lot more. Finally, the actors camp it up something terrible. Now I don't hold with those who say John Wayne couldn't act. If you watch ""Red River"", ""The Searchers"", ""The Quiet Man"", ""True Grit"", ""Hondo"", and a number of others, you'll find an impressive body of work by a dedicated professional. Here, however, Wayne plays Wayne and nobody else. The same is true of just about everyone else in the cast with the exception of the great Walter Brennan, who brings dignity to his role. I am aware that many people really love this movie. I am aware that ""Rio Bravo"" is included in some critics' top ten lists of the best Westerns ever made. I have watched it over and over again to find out what I'm missing, what I can't see. I just can't get it. There is just too little plot and too much ham for my taste.",Rio Bravo
150,pruthvishrathod,classic story of old west,9,13 November 2013,Rio Bravo is another classic story of old west. The Sheriff vs bad guy plot never gets old and everything required to make it great is included here. Rio Bravo has an outstanding set up of the small town with well-crafted sets and equally brilliant soundtrack. Story is quite conventional but the tension jerking atmosphere and a few remarkable sequences lead the situation to higher platform. Characters are well developed. John Wayne playing a righteous sheriff and Dean Martin as his broke-alcoholic deputy gave excellent performances. Especially latter impressed me since I haven't seen much of him as an actor. Ricky Nelson also nicely pulled out young pretty Gun-fighter in his relatively shorter screen-time. Walter Brennan's performance as a disabled old man really stands out. Story floats really well and didn't realize the time being passed till it reaches to its final show-down. There are fewer gunfights in the films than I had expected but that doesn't make it less enjoyable at all. Found romance between John Wayne and Angie Dickinson's character unnecessary though it gave some cool one-liners. Otherwise everything is perfectly executed. great watch,Rio Bravo
151,hondo551,A buddy film in the best tradition,10,20 August 2005,"Today's generation thinks of the ""buddy film"" as a recent development over the last 15-20 years, like 48 Hours or Lethal Weapon or Stakeout, but the ""buddy film"" had it's start in the golden age of adult westerns from the late 40s to early 60s. Howard Hawks, like his contemporary and sometimes hunting companion Ernest Hemingway, was always strongest with male relationships, females were for decoration. Rio Bravo, Hawks' rebuttal to High Noon, like Red River and El Dorado is no different. The male relationships are what holds the characters together, provides their redemptions, and is the primary source for drama and humor like a modern ""buddy picture"". The gunfights for the most part are pre-Peckinpah gun ballet. Duke Wayne provides the granite foundation for one of Dean Martin's best film performances, one of Walter Brennan's finest characterizations, and all are backed up by a stellar cast of western veterans like Angie Dickinson, Ward Bond, John Russell, Claude Akins, Bob Steele, and Bing Russell. A ""buddy film"" is a story of heroes in conflict with each other in the fight of their lives with a healthy dose of humor thrown in for good measure. In that regard, Rio Bravo is one of the best!",Rio Bravo
152,WandrinStar,Rio Bravo (1952),8,15 January 2012,"82/100. Definitely not as good as High Noon, but still good in it's own right. Outside of Ricky Nelson, the cast is terrific with highlight performances from Martin and Wayne. Angie Dickinson also does a great job as maybe one of the better leading ladies opposite Wayne, but the tone and urgency of the film's plot sadly make her scenes seem wasted and uninspired. In a way the film is overrated by some, but it has just about everything a western needs (besides a terrific theme) and gets better upon multiple viewings. Perhaps the best character driven Western since Stagecoach. Fantastic final shootout, writing, and sets. Short warning: Manly, conservative underlings may turn off feminist and liberal viewers.",Rio Bravo
153,louis-king,Fine Ensemble Acting,9,27 May 2007,"Some posters who dislike this movie are unable to separate John Wayne the actor from John Wayne's right wing politics, as if that had anything to do with his performances.Ironically, Wayne himself sought out Kirk Douglas for several of his movies despite Douglas's well known liberal sensibilities.Anyone who doesn't think Wayne was a fine actor should view some of his early westerns of the 1930's to see how carefully he developed his craft. You think John Wayne was always John Wayne? He invented his screen persona. He must have practiced that measured cadence of speech until he couldn't do it any other way because it just isn't there till the 1940's. His deliberate body language was also something he created. The 1930's John Wayne didn't seem to know what to do with his hands. Good acting is not just the ability to disappear chameleon-like into a part; good acting is playing your part so interesting or compelling enough that people will part with 2 hours of their lives to watch you. You think Wayne wasn't a good actor? How many actors could walk into a scene and command authority with their mere presence? Brando? Pacino? Deniro? Pitt? Rio Bravo is not a great John Wayne movie like ""Red River"" or ""The Searchers"". In those movies, Wayne is the whole show despite being surrounded by fine actors. Wayne isn't digging deep here. He playing a sheriff who's comfortable in his skin and his job and only seems unsure of himself when Angie Dickinson's around. The part requires authority, and Wayne displays it effortlessly. Rio Bravo is a great, enjoyable movie because Wayne, though still an important part of the movie, allows everyone else to upstage him in their scenes with him. Just look at one of the best scenes, the singing interlude in the jail-house. Wayne is the only one who doesn't sing; just lets his co-stars do what they do best and enjoys the moment.Dean Martin does the real acting here. He and Ricky Nelson also get to display their musical talent. Walter Brennan does the best Walter Brennan impression ever caught on film. Angie Dickinson; was this her first major role? She really sank her teeth into this one. She was brave, funny and sexy. Of the major actors, Ricky Nelson seemed a bit miscast. He's not bad; he just doesn't radiate the menace that you'd expect from a gunfighter. Steve McQueen or Burt Reynolds would have been better choices. Both were young, up and coming TV actors in 1959.Rio Bravo is not strictly a western; it's a character study that just happens to take place in a western setting. It resembles the old TV show Gunsmoke. You kind of wish there'd been a sequel.Other posters have mentioned that Howard Hawks and John Wayne made this in reaction to ""High Noon"". The big knock against ""High Noon"" is that in the old west, there is no case where a town showed cowardice in the face of gunmen. Quite the contrary. The Jesse James Gang and the Dalton Gang both came to an abrupt end when armed citizenry shot them to pieces. Settling in the old west was act of courage in itself and everyone was as familiar with a gun as with a shovel. In ""Rio Bravo"", every member of that town is brave and rallies behind the Sheriff. In that sense, ""Rio Bravo"" is more realistic than ""High Noon"".I'm not rating Rio Bravo a 10 because it's doesn't transcend the genre the way ""Shane"" or ""The Searchers"" did. It's just good entertainment and I watch it whenever it shows up.",Rio Bravo

He made us laugh out loud several times. True it isn't all action, but more about characters. Ricky Nelson did okay, no Oscars here but a competent enough piece of acting as a young, brash cowboy.Angie Dickinson plays the love interest and boy was she gorgeous in those days! OK so the Duke was cracking on a bit for the young and lovely Angie to fall in love with him, but there wasn't much else in the town to fancy and some women like older men!Very enjoyable Western.

157,kenhe,The American Western the way it ought to be done,9,28 April 2005,"I had not seen El Dorado for several years but I had seen and enjoyed The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, The Alamo, and El Dorado's template, Rio Bravo several times. In a very concrete sense these are all the same movies, and could well be considered to be the godfather of the series, Deadwood. All the films include a very specific use of a broken down alcoholic, apparently not an unusual feature of the real Wild West, usually a good guy, or like in Liberty Valance, Lee Marvin, a quintessential bad guy, or as in the Alamo, well they were all drunks there apparently. John Wayne, a fine if underrated actor, of course sets the pace in all these films, even when surrounded by such excellent actors like Jimmy Stewart, Richard Widmark,Lee Marvin, Ed Asner, Woody Strode, Dean Martin, Robert Mitchum, and Walter Brennan. These movies were morality plays in the finest sense of that genre. We all know that the good gunfighters, led by Big John, will save the day, except at the Alamo where only honor was won, and they will save the day against insurmountable, almost unbelievable odds, but the action and the acting is so extraordinarily convincing that we suspend our cynicism and eagerly and breathlessly follow the action. Unfortunately, the bad gunfighters, and their leaders, are all too one dimensional, so thoroughly evil that the viewer practically prays for their demise. But except in the case of Lee Marvin's portrayal of Liberty Valance, even Ed Asner, or Claude Akins, or Santa Anna had some good qualities, or were at least fighting for a cause of some sort. It might have been more interesting, at least, to show these men as characters and not just cardboard cutouts. In the end, however, all these movies stand out from the many badly done and sadly done westerns were made around the same time. My personal belief is that John Wayne is the main reason. His drawl, his understated and yet strong, manly, and courteous character, and his exemplary behavior both on and off the screen is what made and makes him an enduring role model, and real Hollywood star, even now in our jaded and tawdry times.",Rio Bravo
158,ztruk2001,"Great story, great script, great acting, beautifully shot. What more could you ask for?",10,9 April 2005,"Famously made and inspired by director Howard Hawks' and actor John Wayne's contempt for the western High Noon, Rio Bravo similarly features a frontier lawman waiting on pins and needles until someone can arrive. In High Noon it was the bad guys. In Rio Bravo the bad guys are already in town, it's the U.S. Marshall the sheriff is waiting for. But make no mistake about it. That's nearly all these two movies have in common. High Noon was a dark, cold, and desolate black and white six-shooter melodrama and political commentary. Rio Bravo is a warm, exciting, joyous, and bright technicolor ode to male camaraderie and the old west. Howard Hawks' film contains all of his trademarks. Hard drinking men, fast talking women, enough hidden sexual innuendo to get you kicked out of Church, and of course the dialogue. Sharp, funny, and biting. John Wayne was in fact never much of a talker. He's no Cary Grant. But he is the Duke. Hawks' surrounds him with a colorful assortment of characters to react to and interact with, which is when Wayne is in his element. Walter Brennan is the yappy and big mouthed old codger, Dean Martin is the down-on-his-luck drunk, Angie Dickinson is the insecure but headstrong gambling dance hall girl, and Ricky Nelson is the quiet but youthful rebel gunfighter. Those are the main characters. Ward Bond offers good support as a do-gooder cattle rancher. Pedro Gonzales-Gonzales provides plenty of comic relief as the hen-pecked and stereotypical Mexican who runs the hotel and acts as a go-between for Dickinson and Wayne and their uncertain romantic relationship. Each of them too proud to express their true feelings and emotions. John Russell fills the shoes of the villain, a rich and ruthless cattle baron who hires men to do his killing for him - 50 silver dollars a head. Russell sees very little screen time, but other than the fact that his character is there and we the audience know he's there and so do the characters, he doesn't serve any real purpose. In fact he functions in a similar fashion to what Hitchcock describes as the Maguffin. The good guys need somebody to fight against and he's it. But that's just an excuse to get the ensemble together and have them talk, talk, talk, and then talk some more. You'd be hard pressed to find a movie with more masculine male-bonding and men being men than what's in Rio Bravo. The movie is comprised of one classic scene and entertaining moment after the other. Angie Dickinson throwing the flower vase through the window, the gang sitting around and singing ""My Rifle, My Pony, and Me"", the seven minute opening without a word of dialogue, Dean Martin pouring the whiskey from the glass back into the bottle, John Wayne going up to see Dickinson at the film's conclusion, and on and on and on.

159,whiterabbit06,As classic as it gets,10,13 January 2019,"A perfect ""hangout"" movie. The story moves along slowly but the time we spend with the characters bring out a richness otherwise missed. Classic performces by the cast. Great dialogue. Great score. Great western.",Rio Bravo
160,agsconnolly,Terrific Western with excellent and varied performances,8,6 August 2009,"Rio Bravo was apparently made as a personal riposte from Howard Hawks and John Wayne to the controversial, but excellent, High Noon. And while it certainly has its merits as an alternative to that film, the true success of Rio Bravo is its tremendous characters and the way in which Hawks presents and develops each of them.As the town sheriff, John Wayne is typically steadfast and imposing, and Dean Martin's quite brilliant turn as Wayne's drunken deputy, Dude, is a terrific foil for Wayne. In fact, these two characters could quite easily carry the film alone, but Hawks saw fit to spoil us further with a classic comedy role for Walter Brennan as a crippled deputy, a surprisingly enjoyable cameo from Ricky Nelson and a positively sizzling Angie Dickinson as Wayne's love interest.The whole cast work together excellently - even the near thirty year age difference between Dickinson and Wayne is forgivable in amongst the lovably coy exchanges of their courtship. Brennan is wonderfully cast and provides both comic relief and a reliable assuredness for all the other characters. Nelson is used sparingly, but performs admirably in his role as a young upstart - it is absolutely no hardship to hear he and Martin take turns to plug their day jobs in the film's musical interlude. Martin's performance is the real winner though - his acting here is first rate and gives the film a level of earnestness that could not be readily expected from something so apparently commercial.Rio Bravo has all the facets of a great Western - sharp gunfights, intrigue, superb dialogue and high quality performances that never get too hammy. In terms of film-making, I would place it above Red River in the list of Hawks-Wayne collaborations. It has its slight mis-steps - the film's resolution is possibly too quick and simple considering the build up it is given - but generally speaking this is a very fine Western that is easy to enjoy on many levels.",Rio Bravo
161,PhillipMichaelH,A timeless Hollywood masterpiece.,10,26 May 2012,"When Rio Bravo was released in the spring of 1959, it didn't receive the best reviews but time has proved how inspirational and timeless this movie is. Unlike most westerns at the time like the films of John Ford, it doesn't deal with moral or racial issues. Ford's deeply haunting and emotional The Searchers (1956) is an example. While director Howard Hawks' film is more fun and less dramatic, it is arguably just as personal as anything Ford ever did.Hawks is a director who has had a profound influence on many American and even foreign filmmakers and critics. He made films that are perceptive and witty but also because he was maybe the most versatile director at the time, his work has found a wide range of audiences. Rio Bravo continues the many themes of most Hawks' films and this time, I would argue that it comes together in the best way. From the very first scene, which is a brilliant piece of silent filmmaking, we get a clear idea who each character is and it sets up the story perfectly. We are then taken on a journey of action, adventure, comedy, romance and even drama and self discovery.I won't give away too much in this review because I feel that it would ruin the emotional impact. To understand this film is to understand Hawks as a storyteller who brings together a unique group of characters who are flawed but by sticking together, they can get the job done and come out stronger people. Dean Martin gives an amazing performance as a man who is fighting with the bottle, we assume that he is weak but we get an understanding to why he is struggling and also, when he holds it together, can be very quick and sharp. I've always thought that Martin plays a character that we can all relate to because we can all find ourselves in that position in life and call me sentimental but it's a moving look at any of us are capable of many things but must fight our demons in order to see it and move on.John Wayne is at the top of his game here, just as much as in The Searchers. He plays the sheriff in town who is in a tough situation and can't get caught up with the new girl in town. It's one of the best romances that only Hawks could pull off. They clearly don't understand each other but is obvious that they can't live without each other. We get a lot of the Hawks wit and insight on men and women as in Bringing Up Baby (1938), Only Angels Have Wings (1939) and To Have And Have Not (1944) and it's always fun to watch. Hawks was the best with romance in my opinion, he always got the best out of his actors as well.We see many other characters through out the film and always understand who they are. Not one dull or underdeveloped character in the whole film the way I see it. The point in this review is that Rio Bravo is the best example of what makes a strong Hollywood film, also Howard Hawks in general. Hawks always made fun movies but the characters were never not thought of and never taken for granted, they were always personal to Hawks as well. Today, big advanced special effects distract us from what makes a good movie, the story and the characters. Maybe my review is too simplistic but for me, Rio Bravo is a great movie that holds up and is still relevant as it ever was. I've learned so much about storytelling from this film and hold it as a personal influence on my ambition of wanting to make movies.",Rio Bravo

163,buddyboy28,A truly great western from Howard Hawks,9,3 October 2013,"An absolute classic with The Duke playing to his strengths as the small town sheriff holding a murderer in his jail and keeping alert, waiting and watching for the murderer's brother and his men who are attempting to break him out. At his side are recovering alcoholic, Dude (Dean Martin), young gunslinger Colorado (Ricky Nelson) and cantankerous old cripple Stumpy (Walter Brennan) who doesn't leave the jail for the majority of the film.This isn't so much about the plot as it is the characters, atmosphere and tension. The Duke is perfect as John T.Chance. His effortless star quality and laid back persona comes across great in every scene he's in. He's tough, brave and not scared of any man but introduce him to a woman and it's an whole other matter. When he meets sexy new woman in town (Angie Dickinson)he's shy and awkward and completely out of his comfort zone.One of the best aspects of the film is the fact that it was made in 1959, when men were supposed to be men, rough, tough and ""a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do"" but surprisingly the men here are portrayed as warm, flawed and vulnerable.It's way ahead of it's time in that respect. This is also a buddy film. The main characters have an underlining respect and affection for each other that is hardly ever spoken, it's shown purely through their expressions and actions. For instance the scene where Chance hands Dude his guns back that Dude had sold to buy booze and didn't even know Chance had, speaks volumes. As does the scene where Stumpy mistakes Dude for a villain and nearly kills him. Dude finally realises just how low he has sunk after getting cleaned up if his own friend didn't recognise him and Stumpy feels terrible and scared that he nearly killed him. There's so many great moments between the cast.This isn't really a movie about holding a prisoner at all, that plot point is merely an excuse to show the loyalty and friendship between the characters. The cast is great and the chemistry between them is terrific. It's consistently humorous without coming across as forced and on many occasions even looks ad-libbed it's so natural. Even the moment when the guys lock themselves away in the jail and kick back for a sing along (minus the Duke) somehow works.The bad guys are out in the street, the sheriff and his men are locked up bored. What are you going to do? It's a fun scene that fits in nicely rather than jarring with the other events that play out. And a mention to the Mexican tune that occasionally plays throughout the film which is a great piece of music. The Duke seemed to have an habit of starring in westerns that were ahead of their time and before the spaghetti westerns came along, this Hollywood western already seemed to be showing off a spaghetti vibe with it's scenery and music. In fact it's the very music that inspired Sergio Leone for the type of sound he wanted from Ennio Morricone for A Fistful Of Dollars.All in all, Rio Bravo is a fun movie and one of the all-time great westerns. A leisurely paced film with endearing characters, witty dialogue and well staged shootouts. They really don't make them like this anymore.",Rio Bravo
164,dickhill-inc,Wayne does the right thing,8,30 October 2020,"Damn do I ever love this movie. It's John Wayne doing what's right no matter the consequences, backed up by the few men who believe in the same thing. Angie Dickinson is as beautiful as a woman can be and the only thing standing between them is the eras censors. Not only that she's tough and independent. I watch this movie when I want to see how a man should act. They made it three times so it's gotta be good. Thank you, all involved.A much better review is BrandtSponseller. That's what I mean but can't say. Especially the staging/blocking comment.",Rio Bravo
165,Scott-52,direction and acting carry this classic,9,23 December 1998,"Rio Bravo stands on its own as a remarkable piece of movie-making. By almost any measure, the remake ElDorado is a pallid reflection of it. In Rio Bravo, you have Walter Brennan coming into his own as a western icon; John Wayne answering  the call to serve the townpeople who elected him, in effect throwing down the gauntlet to High Noon. Most of all, you have Dean Martin, presenting a shattering portrayal of an alcoholic that ranks with Paul Newman in the Verdict, Jack Lemmon in Days of Wine and Roses, or Bing Crosby in the Country Girl.Give Dean his due. Too much has been written about him as a Rat-Packer sycophant. He was his own man throughout, and between the times of his split with Jerry Lewis and his Las Vegas-drunkie persona he proved that he could act. RIO Bravo, Some Came Running and the Young Lions answer any question about his ability. He makes this movie more than a western,",Rio Bravo
166,mime.de,One of my favorites,10,3 December 2000,"I'm a fan of Western since I was a child. Meanwhile, in the age of 50, I've changed positive thinking about of some of my favorites when I was young. But - beside John Fords monument ""The Searchers"" - Howard Hawks ""Rio Bravo"" is still of the pictures I love and admire more every year. This Western for me is one of the best films ever made. It found every involved artist in a top form: The actors, off course a giant performance of the Duke, impressive acting of Ricky Nelson and Angie Dickinson, Dean Martin at it's best as the drunken deputy and a wonderful Walter Brennan as the grumbling and slandering old sidekick Stumpy; Hawks intelligent and calm directing; the perfect dramatic and humorous script from Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett; Russell Harlans indoor-photography; and at least the powerful music score from Dimitri Tiomkin, who did his best job since ""High Noon"", the Western which made Hawks so angry that he filmed ""Rio Bravo"". I love this picture, and I know some people who don't like this genre but love this outstanding great movie too!",Rio Bravo
167,nmathieson,The Most Enthralling Western,10,15 June 2005,"Yet another Howard Hawks masterpiece is created in this thrilling western. Staring John Wayne as a lonely sheriff who's only company is an old cripple played by Walter Brennan and a former great law man now drunk played by Dean Martin. The trouble begins when John's character named Chance arrests a criminal whose brother is Nathan Brennan the most dangerous gang leader in the west. Nathan then comes to town to see if Chance would consider freeing his brother. Chance refuses sending the law and the bandits into a war against each other.This is my favorite western movie of all time as it is filled with action, adventure and mountains of excitement. Along with that, my favorite director Howard Hawks directs with unbelievable precision and compassion which was shown through this film unbelievably likable characters. Amazingly Ricky Nelson and Dean Martin pull out fantastic performances, which can be attributed to Hawks' direction.Beyond that this film includes everything that people love about westerns. Giant gun fights, characters larger than life, a beautiful women, the ultimate standoff of good and evil, and a truly marvelous story.",Rio Bravo
168,abeachedwhale,Mostly Backlot Rollercoaster Drama,6,24 June 2021,"The plot takes multiple turns, half of which are predictable and the other half unpredictable. It's hard to separate actor from character when watching two particularly large egos on screen as Wayne and Martin. This made it straining when the forced character struggles of a particular crooner changes his mind at the drop of a hat. A lot about this movie felt forced, such as Wayne's part and ""love interest"". These things don't completely detract from what I think are redeeming qualities. The framing of some scenes is pleasing. Sparse comedic surprises are here and there. One of my favorites (might not be intentional) is Gonzalez-Gonzalez calling Wayne what sounds like ""Señor Chez"". I would much rather have enjoyed it if there was less reliance on backlot sets with closed windows. Half the movie feel like a sterile laboratory attempting to churn out machoness. As far as recommending a friend to watch, I think this movie is skipable.",Rio Bravo
169,Epaminondas,Perfection,10,3 January 2005,"This film is perfection.I hesitate in calling it the ""greatest western of all time"", as so many defining elements of the genre are lacking (for one thing, all the action takes place within city limits  so much for horse riding across western landscapes). More importantly, it transcends genre barriers and stands in a world of its own. A world of pure and simple correspondence between ends and means of the film-making process, that is, of classic perfection.As many have noted, the starting point is simple: a sheriff needs to keep an outlaw in custody, other outlaws try to spring him. The ease and grace with which Hawks creates a two-hour long narrative from this, both elaborate and always radiantly clear, at the same time fast-paced and seemingly immobile, would be overwhelming if the result were not of such classic evidence.This he does by perfectly balancing the characters, whose common point is the need for redemption or fulfillment, whether they are too old (Stumpy), too weak (Dude), too young (Colorado) or even too desirable (Feathers). Sheriff Chance is both unwilling to relate to them and unable to do without them  thus conferring a constant ambiguity to his behavior, balancing between pardon and anger, an ambiguity instantly redeemed by the righteousness and the physical grace with which he moves among them  ""Sorry don't get it done, Dude"" must be my favorite quote from any movie.The same balance can be found between the few action scenes and the more gentle episodes. The action is scarce, but then all the more intense as it comes both inevitably and at unexpected moments. It is climactic and beautifully shot and choreographed. There are few gunshots (excepting the ending), but always to the point (if not always on target). To illustrate this, let us examine the episode in which Dude shoots an outlaw he and Chance are pursuing. He is unsure of whether he has hit him: this uncertainty is at once transmitted to his whole character, and to a characteristically sceptical as well as sympathetic Chance. In this sense, not a shot is wasted, as they define so powerfully the essence of characters and relations between them. The same could be said of young Colorado's ascension, materialized through his gun fighting ability. This is a classic feature of westerns, brought to unseen heights by Hawks.These action scenes contrast beautifully with three other kind of scenes: the romantic seduction scenes in which Angie Dickinson shines; the comedy scenes taking place in the hotel, and the alternately anguishing and joyful scenes in the prison  culminating, as a reviewer has noted, in the songs shared by Dude, Stumpy, Colorado and an appreciative and silent Chance, a blissful moment in which time, the plot, the suspense are cast aside and all is left is an exceptional complicity between the characters, the director and the spectator.Many defects can be found here and there, yet as a whole, the movie is perfect, as it creates with seemingly effortless grace a world  complete with strong and weak characters, a sense of time and space, right and wrong, necessity and chance (not a meaningless name for Wayne's character)  we at once recognize and love as our own.",Rio Bravo
170,briangetmail-70510,Dean Martin at his Best,10,14 August 2018,"Dean Martin should have gotten an award for his part in this film. I like how the two team up to fight the bad guys, you can see there's a real friendship here. A bit slow in parts but some good action scenes. My only disappointment was John Wayne didn't take on John Russell, he's a big man, a bit taller than Wayne. That would have been quite a fight to see.",Rio Bravo
171,BrianV,"Almost perfect, but . . .",9,30 November 1998,"It's hard to go wrong with a western with a cast that includes John Wayne, Dean Martin, Walter Brennan, Ward Bond, John Russell and Claude Akins, and with a master director like Howard Hawks. The by-play between the characters, the overlapping dialog (a Hawks trademark), the bursts of violent action all contribute to an almost perfect film. There are, however, two drawbacks that keep it from being just about perfect, one minor and one major. The minor one is Angie Dickinson. While a competent actress, she just doesn't seem to click with Wayne onscreen (although she has stated she clicked with him very well offscreen). She tries hard, and she does have her moments in the film, but overall her part drags the film down a bit. The major obstacle, though, is Ricky Nelson. It's blatantly obvious that he was brought into the movie to draw in the teenagers, as he was a major singing star of the time. He's so laid-back he's almost comatose; he mumbles his lines, and when you can understand him it sounds like he's talking in his sleep. The film comes to a screeching halt whenever he starts to talk, and even in the action scenes it loooks like he's doing everything in slow motion. You don't believe for a second that he's a tough Texas gunfighter; he looks more like a schoolboy playing hooky and hanging out with the older guys. However, Nelson isn't onscreen all the time, and when he isn't, everything clicks to make an almost perfect western . . . almost.",Rio Bravo
172,Kanadiz,An American Western like no other,8,21 June 2008,"Howard Hawks, director or numerous great films such as ""Scarface"" from 1932, ""His Girl Friday"" from 1940 and ""Red River"" from 1948 gives us an American western like no other. One of the great things about ""Rio Bravo"" are the characters, Hawks has a great talent for making us care so much for these characters and here you get all the sort of characters you'd want in a great western. There's a tough sheriff (John Wayne as John T. Chance), a drunken ex-sheriff (Dean Martin as Dude), a young gunslinger (Ricky Nelson as Colorado Ryan), a beautiful broad who's constantly flirting with the sheriff (Angie Dickinson as Feathers) and an old cripple who can't shut-up to save his life (Walter Brennan as Stumpy). Like another American classic western ""High Noon"", we get a great showdown at the end and let me just say that it's an explosive scene.The plot is simple, a man named Joe is arrested for a murder in a saloon and Chance is holding him in a small jail where his friend Stumpy is guarding him. If Joe's brother's henchmen try to break in the jail, Stumpy will kill Joe. Usually I would say that if Dean Martin was in the picture, then I wouldn't really care for the film. But to my surprise, his performance was the most interesting. Not that the other performances weren't grand because this film simply doesn't have a bad performance, even though I am not a fan of the Duke. Although he did have a few great performances such as ""Red River"", ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" and The Searchers"" which is arguably is best role.Watching this film for the second time, I was reminded of Dean Martin's great battle over alcoholism in the film. From his torn clothes, his facial remarks, his non-stop sweating, to him punching his leg several times to stop the shaking or not even being able to role his own cigarettes since his shaking hands wont permit.Lately I've discovered that ""Rio Bravo"" was remade into ""El Dorado"" also directed by Howard Hawks which may not be as great as ""Rio Bravo"" but it still was a high entertaining western also staring John Wayne and this time Robert Mitchum taking on Dean Martin's role and to my surprise the young James Caan since the oldest film I've ever seen of James Caan was ""The Godfather"" in his most glorious role as 'Sonny'.According to IMDb.com, I've read that director Quentin Tarantino stated that ""Rio Bravo"" is one of his all-time favorite films, and I find this very easy to understand because it's a film that is very hard to dislike. It can easily be called at least a guilty pleasure, although there isn't really anything to be guilty about liking this film. However out of the whole film, I had one objection to it. There is a scene where Dean Martin starts to sing in the jail and young Ricky Nelson joins in with his guitar and sings along. Now this bothered me not because I'm not a fan of these two singers but I just believe that no one wants to see people singing in a western. Other than this scene, I have no complaints towards this film, the acting is great, the directing is great and hence the film is great.",Rio Bravo

174,star_in_the_zenith_79,"Not John Wayne's best, but definitely one of his better ones",8,4 May 2020,"People rag on John Wayne to much for playing himself, or playing similar characters in all his movie. I guess most of us who didn't live in those times fail to understand that that is what people wanted. Doesn't mean he couldn't.Rio Bravo is richly entertaining, the characters are very likeable and you can't help but smile at some of their antics, particularly old Walter Brennan. I felt Dean Martin and Rickey Nelson really stole the show here as well.Yeah sure, it suffers from a few of the same problems spaghetti westerns of the time did. Some of the gunfights were a little tacky and unrealistic, Angie Dickenson as the love interest sometimes overacted. The lead up to the murder at the beginning by Joe Burdette that initiated the whole plot seemed pretty flimsy and forced.But the good far outweighs the bad with this one.",Rio Bravo
175,MAXIMUMMOVIE,Wayne and Martin can't miss,8,11 March 2005,"I'm a believer that every movie fan should sit and watch several ""must see"" movies or maybe better said for some situations several of the same ""types"" of must see movies. John Wayne in himself is that ""Type"". I don't think any actor before him or since has had such on screen command as ""The Duke"" did. Rio Bravo was just one of many of the examples of the John Wayne in action, who despite playing the role at 52 left no questions who the star was among a cast of stars.One thing that is quickly noticed is the broad range of ages of the stars in ""Rio Bravo"" and the good guys included as mentioned John Wayne at 52, Dean Martin at 42, Angie Dickinson at 28, Ricky Nelson at 19, and last but not least in the old ""spaghetti"" western styleside kick Walter Brennan at 65. Maybe the cast was set that way to attract a broad base of fans or maybe it was just the way the story goes, I can't say.Now of the cast I'll go through it quickly. John Wayne was his same old self, great. Dean Martin did an impressive role and like Wayne was a pleasure to watch. Angie Dickinson, in short played the misunderstood hottie, personally I didn't think she added much but it let the viewers see the star (Wayne) had it really going on. Ricky Nelson was almost an annoyance around such greats as Wayne and Martin although his (Nelson's) part was woven into the story to much to do without. Then there is Walter Brennan, what can you say, great actor in an overdone all-be-it entertaining role.The film really is a case study in my opinion. You have the classic great in Wayne, Martin and Brennan. You toss in an attractive female. And I assume the theory was bring in the younger female viewers with Nelson giving Wayne and Martin might not do it at ages 52 and 42 respectively.By the way there were actually some bad guys in ""Rio Bravo"" but in the presence of the good guys it really didn't matter who they were.I last viewed ""Rio Bravo"" on the DVD and although there is no denying it is a 45 plus year old movie it was clear, clean and nice on the eyes but limited to mono sound.It really is a shame the western genre is all but dead. ""Rio Bravo"" shows that with Stars bigger than life there is more than an abundance of quality entertainment value. Maybe things are as they say everything goes in cycles, maybe one day we will have another dominant figure such as John Wayne have us eager to see outlaws, good-guys and the six gun shootouts.",Rio Bravo

Wayne plays the usual leading cowboy. Martin does a good job of playing the drunken bum who has fallen off the wagon. And Nelson sort-of fits in with the young good guy.Walter Brennan makes it for me though. Very cleverly done on his part with the grumbling and one-liners.I see that Carlos passed away early in 2006. RIP mate.",Rio Bravo
177,guyinnanaimo,Rio Bravo ~ NOT an '8'!,4,24 May 2017,"This western was SO disappointing! John Wayne was rather tame in this one, and seemed bored by it all; Brennan was OK; Dean Martin was NOT good; Ricky Nelson was forgettable. Dickinson was the best of the lot, and that ain't saying much. It just seemed it was filmed on a poor set ~ lifeless all the way around. I think it may have been a 6 or so in its day, but this oater doesn't hold up to some of the good western that came out in the late 50's/early 60's. The '4' I give it now is GENEROUS!",Rio Bravo
178,freddyschmitz,Howard Hawks' Masterpiece,10,26 August 2016,"The Howard Hawks' answer to ""High Noon"" (also great, go check it out!). Its a great tale about male comradeship, professionalism and standing your ground against injustice, even when the odds are against you.The plot is fairly simple: The local sheriff (portrayed by John Wayne) locks up the criminal Joe Burdette whose brother Nathan Burdette, a rich and ruthless rancher, promises everyone who is willing to get his brother out of jail a good prize, resulting in the local sheriff department practically being under siege by the local thugs. Sheriff John T. Chance's job is then to hold out with his two deputies, a recovering alcoholic (brilliantly portrayed by Dean Martin) and an old man talkative man with a limp (portrayed by Walter Brennan, he adds a lot of comic relief into the story) until the Marshall arrives to take Joe Burdette with him. Later they get help from another young gun man (portrayed by Ricky Nelson, who's a good addition to the trio). Chance has to enforce law and order all while dealing with his deputies alcoholism, with non professionals offering their help and with a mysterious woman who later becomes his love interest (portrayed by Angie Dickinson, in a typical hawksian woman role).What makes this movie is so great is the great dialogue, strong performances (especially Dean Martin and John Wayne), likable characters and the great portrayal of their interactions and relationships with each other. You end up really caring about them and see them deal with their personal struggles, like you would with characters in a long running TV show, the only difference being that it happens in 2 and a half hours without feeling rushed. There are several small subplots that all add up in the end in a satisfying way, feel relevant and bring more depth into the characters.In my opinion Howard Hawks' masterpiece with a strong message. Stand your ground and do what you believe is right, even if it seems impossible. And if no one is fit to help, then do it yourself. No one is responsible for your actions, except for yourself. Good can overcome evil.One of my all time favorites and in my opinion the best western of all time. Highly recommended. A must see for people who are interested in westerns, movies from the 50's, Howard Hawks and/or John Wayne. 10/10",Rio Bravo
179,jraskin-1,Deserves a place at the top of the list,10,25 April 2014,"This is one of the greatest feel-good Westerns ever made. I would rank it among the top three Westerns of all time. Everything goes according to formula, but it's so well scripted, acted and directed that whenever it appears on our beloved TCM, I cannot stop watching until the movie is finished. It appears as though all the lead actors were having a great time going through their paces, and the result is an incredibly joyful experience for a movie lover. Ricky Nelson, Dean Martin, Walter Brennan, all at the top of their games. John Wayne really has never been better. This movie is just so well-crafted, that anyone that doesn't embrace it as one of the best examples of the Western genre, is just not getting into the spirit of the great American Western. And please tell me who was ever sexier than Angie Dickinson in her role as ""Feathers."" Really one of the greatest movies of all time!",Rio Bravo

And it was a damn good movie. The characters were great especially dean martin and IL stumpy, he do make me laugh. I also thought the song they sang in the sheriff building was pretty swell too.

Despite having a very simple premise, (A Sheriff, a drunk and cripple defending a town against a bunch of bad guys) this movie is incredibly well put together. The story is simple but clever with a classic twist. The characters are colorful and multifaceted, they are almost your typical heroes but with some unique flaws that give them a more realistic edge. The acting is on point, with John Wayne and Dean Martin at their best. The pace of the movie is superb with a great build up to the final all out gun battle climax. This is all wrapped up with a beautiful movie score. I recommend anyone who enjoys it to check out the series ""Godless"" to see a modern day equivalent with realistic female characters.

This is about three men facing off a gang of low lifes headed by John Russell.  Probably my favorite John Wayne western.  As far as excellence, I would compare this movie to High Noon.  This movie was remade two other times (all with the Duke), El Dorado and Rio Lobo (I also saw a variation of this story on an old Gunsmoke episode).

184,vern-729-149732,And I don't even like old westerns!,10,24 June 2016,"Usually I don't like these types of old westerns. They often present a ""let's go camping with our cell phones and gourmet freeze dried food"" version of the old west. I think the old westerns tend to make it more glamorous than it was. I do like many of the recent westerns. Probably starting with ""The Unforgiven"", and I also like any of the classic spaghetti westerns with Mr. Eastwood. Those are often more gritty and quite different compared to this type of ""amusement park western"" with John Wayne.However, this one was just plain dang fun with great characters and a believable romance (Every time there's any type of romance in any movie that the film maker's want me to believe in, I compare it to Star Wars Episodes 2 and 3. Two movies to create a convincing love story and it failed miserably). What I appreciated was that it wasn't ""simplistic"". The developing romance between the Wayne and Dickinson's character had some ""relatively"" complex elements that weren't simple western cookie cutter, not all spelled out, type of cinematic relationship. Yeah it wasn't that complex but it was interesting to figure out the motivations and fun to follow along. There was even some comic relief! Quite frankly, Angie Dickinson was a major hottie in her day. Whoa! She looked familiar but I couldn't place the face. Didn't recognize her AT ALL. I had to check the credits.Some reviewers don't care for the romance and the longer story development elements, but just like one of those man made climbing walls at a sporting goods stores, without it there aren't any good handholds. I need those parts to hang on to, keeping my interest so I can keep climbing to the top.Without some slowing down and something to care about, the rest of the action is just another old western that bores the heck out of me. I know people who ""fast forward"" or ""talk"" through the slow bits in action movies. I am the complete opposite. Without that back story, without the stuff that happens BETWEEN the action sequences, I have no commitment or involvement in the outcome. Without light there's no dark. Without contrasts it's all ""one color"".I couldn't sleep, it was early early morning so I was up anyway, flipped on the TV and this was on. Was going to change channel but was too lazy and hadn't planned to watch anything ""with commitment"", just background noise. But then I got sucked in and before I knew it was totally engrossed in the characters and story and really enjoying it.The only thing I might have left out would have been the kind of out of place, awkward ""musical break"" from the two major singers in the cast. I thought this would be coming at some point but hoped they might skip over it... but... at least there wasn't too much of it. I can't imagine two ""cowboys"" with singing voices like that just randomly thrown together in the same town in the same dangerous situation. Another one of those ""throw out all believability"" old western cliché.The Colorado character seemed a bit out of place and unconventional but I think he pulled it off. Acting was a bit stiff but I didn't mind. He was almost like a ""Deus Ex Machina"". Might be too strong to say that but close enough. He was always in the right place at the right time.Some say it was too long? Wow... I was actually disappointed when it ended. I wanted more. Guess I have to watch some Gunsmoke reruns. I had to give it a 10 out of 10 based on how much I enjoyed it. When the time just flies by without consciously noticing, and I feel sad when the credits roll, I have to give it a 10.",Rio Bravo
185,jarmic6,Everybody Needs Somebody,10,25 July 2008,"In a small town in Texas, a criminal (Claude Akins) is arrested after committing a murder. He is kept in prison by three guys. The local sheriff (John Wayne) and his two deputies, a drunk (Dean Martin) and a crazy old fool (Walter Brennan). Still, a threat hangs around their necks (and around town). The guy they imprisoned is the brother of a big time criminal (John Russell) who will do anything to help him escape. The three main characters have to do their best in order to keep their prisoner in until the judge comes to take care of the whole thing. But the judge takes too damn long to come.In the meantime a group of people arrives in town. Among them an old friend of Wayne's called Pat Wheeler(Ward Bond), a beautiful ex (?) gambler (Angie Dickinson) and one of Wheelers assistants (Ricky Nelson) who later teams up with Wayne. When Wayne explains the situation to Ward Bond and clarifies that the only people helping him are a drunk who can't stand and an old guy, his friend asks: ""That's all you got?"". Wayne responds: ""That's what I got"". And that's the whole point. Rio Bravo is about people who know life is hard but they accept that as a fact and try to make the best of it. It's a film about a bunch of people in the search of confirmation. Every character in this film is weak and struggles with his weaknesses. This is expressed in a really subtle way through Howard Hawks' visual storytelling and one of best screenplays of the 50s. Just take a look at the opening scene. Dean Martin walks in a bar. He looks dirty and tired. Most customers look at him as if he's the worst bum of the town. Someone throws a coin in a spittoon near Martin. Martin bents in order to take the coin and buy alcohol. Suddenly, as Martin reaches for the spittoon, someone kicks it away from him. He looks up. It's Wayne. That's the first time we see Wayne in the film and the way this moment is directed sets up the way he is related with Martin. Martin sees Wayne from a low angle. He looks imposing, proud and dynamic. He is almost a father figure to Martin. Actually, latter in the film, Martin calls Wayne Papa. Throughout the film these two guys try to balance their relationship. In the first half of the film Martin depends fully on Wayne. He is the one who gets him out of every mess and tries all the time to motivate him in order to get out of the state he is. When Wayne talks, Martin keeps his eyes on him. He exposes his weaknesses, his faults and disadvantages all the time to Wayne, hoping he will comfort him. But Wayne doesn't do that. He expects the best from him. Martin used to be a great shooter in the old days and Wayne tries to get him back in shape. Not though asking him to stop drinking. But through his high expectations. Wayne's character is even weaker and although at a first look he may seam strong and willing he is the most screwed up of them all. He is the guy who has a thing about his image. He has built a persona and he holds tight to it. He wants people to think he's cool and strong and he does his best to achieve that. He is really detractive with everyone. When his friend Ward Bond is killed by the Russell gang he blames Ricky Nelson for not protecting him. He is very ironic with Walter Brennan for everything he does wrong. But Angie Dickinson touches his soft spot. From the first time they meet she has the upper hand though it might appear otherwise. She just has to raise her dress up a bit or throw a minor sexual insinuation and Wayne becomes all sweaty and nervous. He is terrified by her sexuality but if we look at it more deeply we can even say that what terrifies him is the possibility of him bonding with someone in an erotic level. His fear of sex and emotion makes him look like a fool most of the times he's in the same scene with Dickinson. But there is a point where all that stops and Wayne, subtly, changes and accepts his feelings for Dickinson. That point is defined by the moment in which Dickinson calls Wayne's character by his real name (John). She is the first one to do so and that's a way of her declaring her wish to be closer with Wayne. She actually is the only person who is able to see through his hard boiled persona.By the end of the picture, when the bad guys have lost, the relations of the characters are balanced. When Wayne is walking with Martin, who can now stand on his feet (literally and metaphorically), Martin gives him advice on what to do and how to behave with Dickinson. Everything is alright now, not because the Russell gang is gone, but because all the characters of the film have reached a point of consciousness. There is a scene where all the main characters (Wayne, Martin, Brennan and Nelson) are at the prison guarding Akins. The Russell gang has put a Mexican band playing a song which is supposed to warn them that they're about to die. Our guys seam worried and nervous.And what do they do? They grab a guitar and they start singing. That's a moment where these guys really bond with each other. Music (and art) is supposed to do that (bring people together). And that's what the movie finally is about. About people's need to come together. Not because they have to serve the law. But because the need for company is maybe the most basic of all human needs.",Rio Bravo

188,knight_hawk2002,Excellent Movie,10,27 October 2005,"This is a truly excellent classic western directed by the legendary Howard Hawks. Its not simply good because it has the most popular actor of the sound era in the leading role but it strikes a cord with audiences like few other movies. It boasts a good storyline of morals and outsiders with plenty of action thrown in to satisfy the general western fan. The movie has become a cult in the 90's and is the favourite movie of several directors including John Carpenter. Watch out for Ricky and Deano singing and Duke facing up to the bad guys with a rag tag bunch of deputies.

But Rio Bravo is not superb.  Part of the problem is that it is about 30 minutes too long, another problem is Angie Dickinson, although she may be a fine actress her whole romance thing with John Wayne was dull and completely dragged out the movie.

191,falconhawke,Finally Crafted Western Epic About Friendship In Tough Times,10,22 September 2021,"There are so many reasons to watch this film that it isn't even funny, if you haven't seen it already. If you have you know what I'm talking about.It's funny, tender, sentimental, brutal, and full of acting performances from every actor on the screen that I think are some of the best in any western I've ever seen. Including Angie Dickinson. And I've seen a lot of westerns. Her weary longing for a better life than the one she has, seizing on the Sheriff as someone she wants to stay with as long as she can despite him trying to get rid of her as much as he can, I think it was an excellent performance.I don't want to list any more of the reasons to watch this film that I already have. There are just so many as I mentioned at the start that it's really a no-brainer. It is also one of those films that seeing it several times it just seems to get better with each viewing.But I'm going to list one reason here at the end that also matters to me. This is a John Wayne Western that is not a racist film. There are major characters who drive the plot that are Mexican, it has none of the stuff of the Ford westerns of Wayne's earlier career.Rio Bravo is now in my top five of westerns that I think are my favorites. If you watch it it could become one of yours also.",Rio Bravo

193,wspears,My Favorite Movie,10,30 November 2005,"Rio Bravo has an emotional connection with me which makes reviewing it objectively virtually impossible. It is just about the most perfect example in a film, that I have ever witnessed, of action blended with a philosophy of living. Howard Hawks would, no doubt, scoff at such a description--but that is my feeling about it.I first saw the picture when I was about 10 years old in a Saturday matinée at my local theater. The theater was packed with other kids around the same age as myself.The scene that will always live with me from that theater experience, is when, near the end of the picture, two bad guys have managed to dodge John Wayne's bullets and are coming up behind him. We see the two bad men blown away by two shotgun blasts and then we hear the familiar cackle of Stumpy, played by Walter Brennan. When that cackle was heard in the theater that afternoon, the kids in that theater erupted spontaneously into cheers. In some visceral, indefinable way, we kids identified with Stumpy, and his ""supposed uselessness'. And when Stumpy was vindicated in that moment, we felt vindicated.Rio Bravo has many moments like that, especially with its dialog. When Feathers asks Chance what he thinks she should do to avoid being unfairly harassed by lawmen wherever she goes, Chance suggests that she stop dressing the way she does. Feathers looks straight at Chance and says, ""That's the kind of thing I'd do, if I was the kind of girl you think I am, sheriff."" Rio Bravo is a deliberately slow movie. And in its deliberateness, Rio Bravo examines a number of different themes. Some of them are: Rio Bravo is an exploration of what loyalty means. Besides the obvious loyalty of Chance and Dude and Stumpy, there is the example of Chance's friend Wheeler, who ends up dying for his loyalty. And Carlos the hotel owner, who by the end has come up to help Chance--with a shotgun that is as big as he is. But again, there is the dialog, such as when Chance hands Dude his own set of guns, that Dude had pawned long ago for a drink. Dude looks up at Chance as they are walking, ""You've been holding these all this time?"" Chance replies, ""Been waiting till they fit you again"".Rio Bravo is also an exploration of what bravery is. Again, there are the obvious scenes of bravery involving Chance, Dude and Colorado. But there is also the scene, for instance, of Feathers, sitting in a chair asleep in the morning--outside of Chance's bedroom at the hotel. She has obviously been ""standing guard"" all night. Chance exasperatedly chides her for this, but her bravery is undeniable and touching But most of all, I think that Rio Bravo is an exploration of friendship, and what it can mean for us to have a friend by our side, through it all, no matter what.As a young boy, watching this movie years ago on the big screen, it had a profound effect on me. Like Mia Farrow in Woody Allen's The Purple Rose of Cairo, I felt like I was transported into the screen. Whenever I watch Rio Bravo, it still has the same impact for me.I can't say that about too many other movies.",Rio Bravo
194,crustysmith,Up there with the best,10,8 May 2013,"A western that reflects old time values and is one of the best. If you love classic westerns this will be in your top ten. There is everything you need. A hero who wins the day. A hero's buddy, fighting his own demons but winning out in time. A young helper, wild and free but able to recognise right from wrong and come down on the right side and then there is an old crotchety wise-head who has seen it all and is honest, true and faithful. Oh, and don't forget a beautiful ""love interest"" in the form of a young Angie Dickenson.John Wayne is ........ well, he's just John Wayne. I cannot convince people who don't love him to see what I see. But if you do love him then this film is just heaven. Walter Brennan is, as always, very nearly the star of the show.It has characters called names like ""Colorado"", ""Stumpy"" and ""Feathers"". Shoot outs. Dynamite. Brawls and baddies. Then to top it all it has unforgettable tag lines like when Chance (John Wayne) calls out the baddie by shouting.... ""Burdett ......... Nathan Burdett"". Priceless. Fills me with tears just writing it down.Never mind the rubbish some may write. This is not a great notable work of art. It is not the greatest acting in the world and it should never be judged artistically. It is just a fantastic old time western starring the greatest film cowboy of all time, supported by the best supporting actors available in a great story. Enjoy.",Rio Bravo
195,HoyaSaxa03,Dean Martin Works,7,26 March 2003,"As the camera in the saloon swings to a low-angle shot and the orchestra strikes an ominous chord, the towering image of John Wayne fills the screen. Just as Wayne had presided over western pictures for thirty years (and would continue to do for more than another decade), veteran director Howard Hawks (Scarface, Red River) almost certainly intended Wayne to carry his 1959 Warner Brothers film Rio Bravo.Fortunately for us, however, Rio Bravo is not your archetypal John Wayne film.Co-star Dean Martin, as `Dude,' an alcoholic gunslinger struggling with sobriety, steals the screen in nearly every scene of Rio Bravo. Martin's potent mixture of innate coolness, vulnerability, and unflustered acting creates a dynamic and vibrant character that truly drives the unhurried emotional tenor of the film.Rio Bravo opens with Wayne's John T. Chance - a beefy cow-town sheriff with a resilient independent streak - in some considerable trouble. Joe Burdette, the rowdy black sheep brother of powerful rancher outlaw Nathan Burdette, is waiting in the city jail for extradition on murder charges; and the Burdette gang doesn't take too kindly to Chance's vision of court justice.While John T. is as obstinate and ageless as any John Wayne character, the supporting cast, led by Dean Martin's Dude, clearly sets Rio Bravo apart.Because of his stubborn self-reliance and his refusal to place his friends in danger by involving them in the violent situation, John T. relies on only two rag-tag deputies and a young-yet-wise gun-for-hire to protect the county of Presidio, Texas, and keep Burdette under lock and key until the U.S. Marshall arrives.Dean Martin's Dude is known by the local Mexicans as Borachon, or The Drunken One. Dude found his way into a bottle after his woman took off on a stagecoach, and two years later he seems to be in no better shape. Ridiculed by outlaws and cowboys alike, Dude has become a shell of his former sharp-shooting self.Conveniently, however, Dude turns the corner on his grief and alcoholism at just the right time. He joins forces with John T., an old friend and partner, and quickly regains his ability to dispense justice from the hip with circus-style revolver shots.In the best exchange of Rio Bravo, a surprised Nathan Burdette asks Dude: `You're pretty good with that gun when you're sober. How did that happen?' Dude responds with a cool arrogance, `If you mean being good with a gun, I've had a lot of practice. If you mean being sober, I'm gettin' practice on account of your brother.'While Dude is John T.'s close partner, Stumpy provides the happy trigger finger to protect the jail from the Burdette gang, and the wit and thick accent to keep the Fifties audience rolling in the aisles. Unfortunately, like many classic films, most of the humor in Rio Bravo - aside from Stumpy's dead-on impersonation of John Wayne that rivals only Joker's in Full Metal Jacket - does not age well.Young music and film star Ricky Nelson handles the character of Colorado Ryan with remarkable ease. Reluctant at first, John T. learns to trust Colorado for his lightning fast pistol skills, his aversion to meddling in others business, and his silky smooth crooning.Rio Bravo is certainly in the top tier of westerns, and it has its star-studded group of actors to thank. Even with their best work, however, the film just cannot make that considerable climb over the hump to greatness. Like many other films in its genre, the motivations of both the characters and the plotline become hopelessly muddled at times.For instance, the opening scene of Rio Bravo, which sets up the action and main story, is one of the most important parts of the film. In an effort to incorporate most major characters into this scene, however, the inspiration behind the players, especially Joe Burdette, is never clear. In addition, the history between John T. and Dude is never explored or fully explained.That said, director Howard Hawks proves that a wide assortment of actors not usually associated with the genre can help John Wayne carry the film and maintain the leisurely style that propels Rio Bravo.",Rio Bravo
196,johnp46260,Overlooked,9,20 October 2009,"I had avoided seeing this movie for many years because of a prejudice against the casting by the producers of Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson (not real actors) to increase its commercial appeal. One of my all-time favorite Westerns is True Grit, but Glenn Campbell's mediocre performance almost spoils it for me. Despite my apprehension, I recently watched Rio Bravo, mostly to ascertain if my assumption was correct. I humbly admit that I was in error. I love Westerns, and Rio Bravo is one of the best. Ricky Nelson actually did a respectable job in his role and, to my pleasant surprise, Dean Martin showed some solid acting chops. Good story, solid acting, interesting characters - what more can you ask for? I will probably add it to my DVD collection.",Rio Bravo

If you watch El Dorado first like I did, and you're like me, Rio Bravo will be a disappointment - a definite step down in all aspects of movie-making. If you watch Rio Bravo first and like it, you should like El Dorado as well, if not more. If you watch Rio Bravo first and don't like it, you MIGHT like El Dorado better. I don't know how anyone can say Rio Bravo is the better movie of the two.The only thing I can see getting out of Rio Bravo once you've watched El Dorado is to see a younger Ricky Nelson, Dean Martin, or the one of a kind Walter Brennan. Walter was heavy character actor of course, and did a great, specialized job, but his character's personality gets on my nerves. I don't want to watch him again. Other than those three actors, there's nothing to see here that wasn't in El Dorado, and El Dorado had more and better everything.",Rio Bravo

200,greenleaf60,Derivative?,8,25 September 2006,"A greatly entertaining Western. However I enjoy it bit less since I came across The Proud Ones by Robert Webb, with Robert Ryan. If you watch both films, you'll see that Hawks more or less stole the plot for The Proud Ones, even though the films allegedly come from different written sources. The Webb film is much more psychologically nuanced, without all the male bonding with which Hawks litters his films. Rio Bravo is still wonderfully shot and acted, but it feels a bit like Hawks was running on empty creatively, as he actually remade this film yet again a few years later. Again with Wayne (older and less funny), but with Mitchum (okay but looking bored) and James Caan (dreadful) this time. Any mention of the Proud Ones and Rio Bravo would be incomplete without mentioning what a great actor Robert Ryan was. He projects confidence and controlled menace, whereas Wayne is all bluster. Just compare the annoying-jokey tone of the Wayne-Brennan scenes in Bravo to the silent knowing exchanges between Ryan-Brennan (old Walter pops up in almost every Western in those days) in the Proud Ones.",Rio Bravo

Maybe this is by today's standards, but still it seems slow. Directing, as some have said, is very good. Acting: Seems generally OK but sometimes is wooden, or as one of my companions said, you can tell they are acting.The film maybe tries to be too many things, but this again could be by comparison to modern films.

The character of the fallen gunslinger is a cowboy film cliché but Martin makes it seem fresh and original.The scene in which Dean Martin, and Ricky Nelson sing together is one of my favorite scenes of all time, because the 2 of them are magical together.This film is a little long, and slower on action than most others but i would highly recommend this to any fans or non fans of this genre.",Rio Bravo

He made us laugh out loud several times. True it isn't all action, but more about characters. Ricky Nelson did okay, no Oscars here but a competent enough piece of acting as a young, brash cowboy.Angie Dickinson plays the love interest and boy was she gorgeous in those days!

I couldn't care less if it is a redemption by Hawks for ""High Noon""! I know one thing is for certain, when you watch John Wayne, Dean Martin, Walter Brennan, and the rest of the cast, you can tell that they had a really good time making the film, this, I believe is plain to see.

John Wayne's performance as the ""doing the right thing against all odds"" Sheriff is superb. Dean Martin pretty much plays himself, Walter Brennan provides comic relief and his story in the movie makes you root for him (although you have to pay close attention to find out why) This movie shows you that even though the odds are against you, one man can still do the right thing and come out ahead against the corrupt.

When Ward Bond asks John T. Chance is that's all you've got he states that's what I got.  Ricky Nelson and Angie Dickenson both are very young and slightly out of place but add enough sex appeal and spunk to be believable.

210,tedrhudson,I shoulda just returned the cracked disk,2,24 August 2021,"Netflix sent us ""Rio Bravo"" a few years ago, and it came cracked and unplayable. I said, sure, send us another one. I should have left well enough alone.I was looking for family entertainment, and since the kids liked the John Wayne ""True Grit,"" I thought I would try one of his I had never seen. After I selected it, I read somewhere that the director/producer did not like ""High Noon,"" and that ""Rio Bravo"" was a sort of ""conservative"" response to the classic.Well, maybe. If the point is that, unlike in ""High Noon,"" good Americans don't shirk the hero willing to stand up to the numerous bad guys, I guess it sort of suggested that.But, whereas ""High Noon"" was taut, suspenseful, with the clock ticking in real time, to the tune of ""Do Not Forsake Me, O My Darlin',"" ""Rio Bravo"" was a slow, meandering, lead-footed 2 and 1/2 hour slog to almost nowhere (the final gunfight is resolved by Walter Brennan throwing sticks of dynamite like hand grenades), with lame, wooden dialogue, little tension, ridiculous nicknames for the hero's sidekicks (Stumpy, Dude--who had another nickname, the Spanish word for 'drunk""--, and Colorado), and the very annoying cackling of Brennan. Our then 15-year-old fell asleep.Curiously, Dmitri Tiomkin wrote the music for both movies--and he was a Rooskie!I give it 2 and 1/2 stars, one each for Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson singing, and the half for Angie Dickinson's stockings in the final scene. Angie's character didn't have a name, either, and she was the main love interest--she was known as ""Feathers,"" having apparently worn a few in her opening scene (I didn't see any), or ""the girl."" Aargh!",Rio Bravo
211,gwilym26,"""John Wayne the big guy , Dean Martin the ragged gunslinger called Dude and Ricky Nelson the rockin' babyfaced gunfisted kid. Howard Hawks' Rio Bravo"". Great film",10,13 January 2007,"'Rio Bravo is a typical Western of this age of the long-winded, large screen. It lasts for 140 minutes and it contains enough inventiveness to make do for about half that time. It is, in fact, a soporific blockbuster. John Wayne leads its cast.' Thus we disposed of a piece of flawless story-telling, admirable in its basic simplicity and outward lack of guile, and of a great and selfless performance from Wayne, who helped Dean Martin give the best portrait of his career.Hawks always said that he made Rio Bravo as a riposte to High Noon, in which Gary Cooper's sheriff went 'running around the town like a chicken with his head off asking for help'. That wasn't his idea of a Western hero. To him, it was politically incorrect and morally reprehensible.Sheriff Wayne in Rio Bravo needs as much help as Cooper when he imprisons a murderer and gunmen lay siege to the jail. But he gets it by being his flawed, sometimes comic but fundamentally decent and honourable self. This makes even the drunken deputy (Martin) stand up and fight, and the odd partnership it engenders teaches the sheriff to temper his own insistence on independence. Beside the sheriff and the drunk are Ricky Nelson's young gun, Angie Dickinson's lady gambler, with whom Wayne constantly spars, and Walter Brennan's toothless veteran.In all this, Rio Bravo is a deeply traditional Western. The way it is worked out, however, is anything but that. It's a long film with a pretty slim plot and lots of comic diversions, like Wayne modelling a pair of bloomers for Dickinson, who tells him, 'Those things have possibilities, sheriff. But not on you.' So firmly is the whole thing based on character, however, that you come out of it feeling you've seen something special about humanity in general. It's a feel good movie that for once rings true, even as you admit a certain strand of orthodoxy, even cliché, that is seen in Westerns time and time again. It's also quite exciting, because, although you think that things will probably turn out okay, Hawks never lets you be quite sure of it. Someone's going to have to die, but who, the hero, the sub hero, the lovable old timer, the Mexican help or the Sweetheart. This adds beautifully to the whole experience that is this movie.Watching the film, you won't see any great vistas like John Ford's Monument Valley or backdrops like Budd Boetticher's Lonesome Pine nestling in the Alabama Hills. This is just a scrubby little township with a seedy hotel, a saloon, a jail and nothing whatsoever to commend it, bar the characters who live there.If Ford had made the picture, it wouldn't have been possible to avoid a larger cast and more of an idea of the community at large. If Anthony Mann, another great master of the Western, had done it, there would have been more directorial philosophising and the psychology would have been less basic. What we get from Hawks is austerity, rigour and intensity.Of course, there are a dozen different ways to make Westerns, and Hawks's way in Rio Bravo lacks the epic nature of Red River, the greater flamboyance (and Mitchum) of El Dorado and the sheer if nonsensical fun of Hatari! But it's a better film than any of them because of its concentration and the deep feelings that Hawks clearly poured into it.They say he modelled the Wayne character on himself - but if so, it was surely unconsciously. What he did do was allow a great script by Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett to flow as naturally as possible, while burnishing it with bits and pieces of extemporising, right down to what the actors wore, like Martin's soiled sweatshirt and dirty old hat.When Hawks showed Jack Warner the film, Warner said, 'We hired Dean Martin. When's he going to be in this picture?' Hawks replied, 'He's the funny-looking guy in the old hat.' 'Holy smoke,' said Warner. 'Is that Dean Martin?' It was, and in a way it was his picture.",Rio Bravo

214,nevsteiner,Wooden characters and dialog--a waste of fine talent,4,22 January 2008,"I have a lot of trouble understanding the appeal of this Hawks retread. At times the characters seem to be just aimlessly killing time. There is some kind of in-joke at play here among the characters, but the ""winking"" saps the piece of any dramatic tension it might have had. Especially Duke and Angie seem to be standing in different countries in their scenes together. A roster of talent doing one-person shows. None of the characters appears to have a life beyond the immediate scene, and the clichéd dialog does little to advance the story. It seems to me that Hawks would have been better off taking this outing to the beach. It's beyond the viewer what the Wayne and Nelson characters are doing in the same room together.",Rio Bravo

216,migecro,Don Demarzio,10,27 May 2005,"The actor that played the cowboy on the right when Ricky Nelson's group comes in is Don Demarzio. I met him where he works at a ranch in new york. He taught Ricky Nelson how t ride and Ricky wouldn't ride without him. Don ended up being in the movie and deserves a little credit. He also taught Dean Martin how to ride. He said he got to know John Wayne pretty good also. He said John hated horses and loved being a sailor. He said that in ""Rio Bravo"" John refused to ride a horse. Don also said that John only rode little horses. Don also said that being an extra meant sitting there watching the filming most of the time. He said he was just sitting there for almost all of the filming time.",Rio Bravo
217,interzone-43931,Totally over rated,2,18 June 2018,What a trivial and superficial story. And the phoney acting! Compare this to a Italo-Western -,Rio Bravo
218,MickeyP,The Second Greatest film ever made.,10,8 May 2006,"Fantastic western in which the great John Wayne plays a stubborn sheriff, who arrests a local outlaw for a brutal murder, only the outlaw's brother happens to be a very powerful rancher. Determined to free his brother he employs a group of gunslingers to surround the town to prevent John Wayne's sheriff, John T Chance getting his prisoner out of town and stopping him getting help in. Chance's only help then comes from a drunk (Dean Martin), a crooked old man (Walter Brennan) and a rookie gunfighter (Ricky Nelson). This is with out doubt the best western you are ever going to see. Also starring Ward Bond and Angie Dickinson. Brilliant.",Rio Bravo
219,paulb1,Great OLd time Western,9,18 October 2005,"I continue to watch this movie and seem to get an understanding of the days of the week. Although it has never been talked about during the movie I always seem to get caught up in what day it is when events are happening.I believe in the beginning of the movie it's Friday. Don't ask me why, I just think that the crew is coming into town for the weekend and they need to get their product to market. A Friday night in town would make the ranch hands happy. The scenes in the jail always seem so real. LIke these guys really lived there. The hotel was realistic.When Mr.Wheeler is talking to Chance in the beginning of the movie I looked at the front of the jail and the surrounding area, very real.Getting back to my idea of what day was what. The day of the shoot out was a Saturday because Angie is going to sing after the ""dust has cleared"" perfect for a Saturday night. People coming into town also would lead me to think of a weekend.Anyway; Great movie one that I continue to watch and sometime really can get caught up in the time. The movie makes that era in our history pure magic.Oh one question....the Name on the hotel was the Alamo..Why?",Rio Bravo
220,cwtotty,"""Rio Bravo"" location",9,12 February 2006,"""Rio Bravo"" happens to be in the top 10 of all the movies I have seen. This is one of Wayne's finest. It was so successful that a remake was made under the title of ""Rio Lobo"". I particularly enjoy some of the film-making liberties taken in many of the western movies, not exclusive to John Wayne's. Just a little tip to Wayne fans: look at the background and if you see a saguaro cactus, IT AIN'T Texas! Saguaros only grow in western New Mexico, Arizona, and the north of the Sonoran desert of Mexico. Many of Wayne's (and others) films were filmed in or around what is called ""old Tucson"" which is located roughly 20 miles south of Tucson, Arizona. It was built (and remains) a movie set and is one of the most interesting sites to visit by tourists. I have been there many times and rather than detracting from the movie it only adds to the ambiance of seeing where it was filmed. The main point is: ENJOY a classical excellent western!",Rio Bravo
