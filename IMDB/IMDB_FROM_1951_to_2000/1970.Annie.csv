0,TheLittleSongbird,"Not quite as bad as has been said about it, but an update that's more awkward than clever",4,18 January 2015,"Regarding the other versions of the classic Broadway hit, the 1982 film was one of my favourite films as a child and is still a personal favourite today while the 1999 film is also good and entertaining if a little short and sugary sweet in places. Annie(2014) certainly should be judged on its own merits and without any comparison as well as with an open mind. Seeing it without any prejudice, I do not think it is quite as bad as people has said but as an updating of the story and as a standalone it didn't work.There are some good things here. The best thing about it is Quvenzhané Wallis as Annie, her singing is not brilliant but the energy, enthusiasm and feeling she gives to it is. She's consistently winning in the role and performs with much confidence and charisma with twinkling eyes and a bright smile, all this without falling into saccharine camp. Jamie Foxx has the best singing voice of the whole cast and is a likable Will Stacks, playing him with real authority and charm, coming across as appropriately over-serious to someone more relaxed later on. Sandy is also adorable and almost on par with the dog in the 1982 film, and I was charmed by the chemistry between Annie and Grace.Unfortunately that's it for the things that work. The girls playing the other foster kids try their best but they do come over as over-eager and they don't have much to do, not to do with screen-time but with how they're directed(the only place they shine in some way is Hard Knock Life). Rose Byrne is a mixed bag, she is appropriately kindly and shares a charming chemistry with Wallis but she has very little to do really. Bobby Cannavale underplays the villain role so much that the performance comes across as one-note while Cameron Diaz is rather painful to watch as Miss Hannigan(and this is without any comparison). She's a talented actress but plays the character far too broadly, so over-the-top campy and obnoxiously strident that it makes the rest of the toned-down performances dull in comparison. Regarding the singing, the only one who impresses is Foxx, the rest of the adults can barely carry a tune and the singing in general sounds auto-tuned and in an all-too-obvious way(Easy Street is especially bad in this instance), ""auto-tuned disaster"" sums it up very aptly. The lip-synching is incredibly amateurish too with the performers' mouths moving at a different tine to the music.The songs in the Broadway stage show and the 1982 and 1999 films are marvellous, ones with very catchy melodies that are easily hummable and lyrics that you can recite without problem very quickly. The songs that are included here are arranged in a way to make them more ""current"" but instead they are stripped of their heart and meaning due to the many things added to and taken away from them, some of them changed to the extent they're barely recognisable(like one or two signature lines a song being maintained but the melodies being completely swamped by polyrhythmic harmonies and sounds and even vastly inferior changes in lyrics). Tomorrow just about gets by but Hard Knock Life irritates and Easy Street is completely butchered. And then we have the added ones done especially for this film and while they're ""current"" they're forgettable at best and largely uninspired in style and writing with lyrics so inane it's enough to make one cringe. For anybody yet to see the film they'd think that there'd be a jarring difference in quality with the original songs and the added ones but you know something is horribly wrong when the originals are changed so much that they're actually on the same level in quality to the added ones, that's how much they've been cheapened by the arrangements. The choreography is both sloppy and chaotic, flailing arms being the most memorable and frequent movement of the lot, and apart from Foxx and to a lesser extent Wallis nobody looks natural dancing it. For example I Think I'm Gonna Like it Here looked like it was completely made up on the spot.The equally chaotic and music-video-like production values don't help, most of the musical numbers especially Easy Street were very haphazardly edited, and neither does Will Gluck's leaden direction that has inexperience stamped all over it. The script is weak, with crass humour, cloying cutesiness and the once memorable and engaging characters reduced to bland clichés. The film does try hard to make the famous story relevant by today's standards, but by doing that the heart of the original story is lost and Annie's positivity amidst a harsh world doesn't resonate, which is really what the story and Annie's character is all about. Annie and Stacks's relationship never really grows, despite Foxx's best efforts if there was meant to be a character change for Stacks it wasn't believable while Miss Hannigan's back story suffered from some really clumsy and badly placed writing. The message is more cynical in alternative to heart-warming, handling the benefits of materialism idea very heavy-handedly, while the climatic helicopter chase is just ludicrous, completely devoid of tension and completely out of place compared to the rest of the film.Overall, Annie(2014) is not THAT terrible but while it tries hard the execution for this viewer was awkward and sloppy. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Annie
1,SnoopyStyle,all gloss no heart,4,25 March 2015,"Precocious Annie B (Quvenzhané Wallis) searches for her parents every Friday at a local restaurant who left leaving a note. Her foster mom is the bitter drunk has-been singer Colleen Hannigan (Cameron Diaz). Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx) is a telecommunication mogul. He's not the touchy feely kind. He doesn't connect with the poor and running behind for mayor. Grace (Rose Byrne) is his assistant and Guy (Bobby Cannavale) is his campaign adviser. While rescuing a dog from a couple of bullies, Annie is almost run over and she's rescued by Stacks. The incident becomes a media sensation and she moves in with him.I really like the start with the Orphan Annie fake out. Quvenzhané Wallis is cute enough although I don't think she's that precocious or that great of a singer. Hannigan is not that bad of a foster mom aside from the drinking. They live in a nice house. She's more self-destructive than anything else. Jamie Foxx struggles to be a cold-hearted millionaire. It's a tough balancing act to be lovable enough and not mean-spirited even as he is trying to be cold and mean. He doesn't have much chemistry with Rose Byrne. The new songs are overproduced and lacking in heart. The old song are catchy but it feels like karaoke. It's not good but it's not completely horrible. It's a dream come true for materialistic little girls but not much fun for most others. There are some fun references like the Phil Lord and Christopher Miller fish Twilight movie-inside-the-movie. However, there are not enough smart references and not enough real heart. The movie gets more and more boring as it fades.",Annie
2,Prismark10,One for tomorrow,5,24 March 2015,This is the updated retelling of the musical Annie which itself was adapted into a critically under-par film in 1982.Annie is played by Quvenzhané Wallis and the character is now portrayed as a black street kid living in an orphanage run by the embittered Cameron Diaz. Annie hopes that one day she will be reunited with her real parents.Jamie Foxx plays a germaphobe and aloof billionaire cellphone mogul Will Stacks (Daddy Warbucks deemed to be old hat) who is also running to be mayor of the city. He encounter's Annie after saving her from getting run over and as his polling improves he kind of takes care of her.My kids found the film charming enough and the updated story works fine but the film like the 1982 version lacks depth or fails to become too involving.The songs here have also been updated and there are a couple of new songs. Its just that the rendition of a few of the songs sounded a bit dicey such as the well known Its the Hard Knock life. Rather unforgivable for a musical.,Annie
3,nogodnomasters,I THINK I'M GOING TO LIKE IT HERE,7,10 April 2019,"Quvenzhané Wallis stars in the title role. She is a street smart kid who lives in the foster home of Hannigan (Cameron Diaz) a tough mother who deep down, really deep down, is a good person. Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx) is a billionaire running for the mayor of NY with PR problems. He comes across worse than Mitt Romney eating ""cheesy grits."" He literally runs into Annie, a girl obsessed with finding her real parents.Against his better judgement (kids have germs) he becomes her foster dad for photo ops. Annie realizes her role and plays the part, enjoying it while she can. As you might guess the two become attached to each other and he even allows her to adopt Sandy, a misfit dog who ""licks her own hoo-ha."" She becomes the best thing that ever happened to him.The film has scenes of hope, love and redemption. It is not that serious of a film that it doesn't make fun of itself, musicals, or Annie films in general. As a musical it left something to be desired. Cameron Diaz adds some snarky remarks that were cute, but not really that funny. A film mostly for kids, even though it uses the words, ""hoo-ha"" and ""ass.""",Annie
4,kosmasp,It's a hard knock life,6,14 June 2015,"Or maybe it isn't ... depending on your view and position you are currently in. Only thing you can do is try to compare your situation with other people around you. While I think I watched the original when I was a kid, that's a long time ago, so I can't really compare the movie like that.It's a musical, so if that's a big no for you, do not watch it. It has some nice (cute?) things going for it and the main actress is really good. Child actors can be tough to find or deal with, but in this case you have talent at work. It's almost a shame Cameron Diaz role is flip flopping here, but the clichés have to be fed I guess. Jamie Foxx is doing a good job too of course as a rich guy who lost his touch with his human side. The movie works, but might feel too sugar coated for some",Annie
5,jboothmillard,Annie,4,1 April 2018,"The original 1982 movie, an adaptation of the Broadway hit, based on the popular comic strip, is fun and worthwhile enough, this contemporary remake sees the title character going from red-headed moppet to an African American child with a big afro hairdo, I was willing to give it a chance, produced by Will Smith, Jada Pinkett Smith and Shawn ""Jay-Z"" Carter, directed by Will Gluck (Easy A, Friends with Benefits). Basically in Harlem, Manhattan Island, New York City, Annie Bennett (Golden Globe nominated Quvenzhané Wallis) lives in foster care with several other girls under the care of Colleen Hannigan (Razzie nominated Cameron Diaz), a bitter former singer taking the benefits, who spends most of her time drinking. Annie spends Fridays waiting outside Domani's restaurant, hoping her parents will return, as promised on a receipt note. One day, a city inspector checks on Hannigan's treatment of the girls, she sees her social security number on his form, and goes to find information, but she learns nothing she does not already know about herself. Annie saves a Shiba Inu dog from bullies, she steps out into the road, but is saved by mogul William Stacks (Jamie Foxx), who is running for mayor. Stacks' campaign manager Guy Danlily (Bobby Cannavale) tells him the rescue was caught on video and has gone viral, boosting his popularity, Guy convinces Stacks to take Annie in, to live with him, in a scheme to boost his campaign. Annie enjoys her new surroundings, and makes friends with many staff members, including Stacks' assistant Grace Farrell (Rose Byrne), and she adopts the dog from earlier, naming her Sandy. Bonding with Annie, Stacks reveals he never really knew his father, due to his work commitments, but believed he could understand him if he worked as hard, Annie also helps Stacks and Grace realise their romantic feelings for each other. Annie requests Stacks take her and her friends from Miss Hannigan's foster home to a movie premiere, Stacks is at first disinterested in the movie, but becomes a fan, along with Grace, Annie also insist they go to the after-movie party. Annie's friends are returned home, Annie then shows Grace her Friday routine of waiting for her parents; Grace sympathises and agrees to keep this secret from Stacks. At Hannigan's foster home, the girls accidentally wake her up; Hannigan snaps at them, saying rich people are not nice and will ditch anyone they don't like anymore, recalling her past, in a drunken state she recalls her former music career. Annie is asked to read a speech at a charity event, she runs out, revealing she cannot read, despite being 10 years old and attending school, Stacks decides to find a special-ed teacher for Annie, but Guy believes she will only hinder the mayoral campaign. Teaming up with Hannigan, Guy plans to find imposters to pose as Annie's parents, so that Stacks appears to have found them, to boost his popularity and win, Guy and Hannigan will share the payment. However, Guy plans to dump Annie back into the system following the election, with no care for her wellbeing, by the point Hannigan is having second thoughts, the imposters have already kidnapped Annie. Hannigan tells Stacks about the plan, Guy is fired, and Stacks, Grace, Hannigan and the girls board a helicopter to chase the getaway car. Annie is mistaken in thinking that Stacks arranged her kidnapping, the kidnappers assumed he paid them, not Guy, when she is rescued, she refuses to believe him that he had no knowledge of the scheme. To prove his innocence and he truly cares for Annie, Stacks announces to the press that he is quitting the mayoral race, and Annie helps Grace and Stacks admit their love for each other, all three of them dance and sing happily. Later, Annie announces the opening of the ""Stacks Literacy Centre"", to help children like her learn how to read, everyone sings her song ""Tomorrow"", Hannigan attempts to sing, only to be stopped. Also starring Lost's Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje as Nash, David Zayas as Lou, Dorian Missick as Annie's ""Dad"" and Tracie Thoms as Annie's ""Mom"". Wallis is suited to the leading role, she is both cute and confident, Diaz is nowhere near as memorable as Carol Burnett, and Foxx is adequate as the cynical billionaire won round by the youngster. It sticks to the same sort of plot, girl brought in to change a rich man's reputation and wins him round, only differences are she is an orphan in foster care rather than an orphanage, and everything is more modern, including the use of technology to assist characters. ""Hard Knock Life"" and the other original songs you are still just about able to sing along to, but it is a bit haphazard, the script is predictable, the choreography is not as slick, and the use of more vibrant colours is distracting, it is a fair but slightly sloppy musical comedy drama. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for ""Opportunity"", and it won the Razzie for Worst Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel. Okay!",Annie
6,tavm,This filmed version of the musical Annie is enjoyable enough,7,22 December 2014,"All right, I previously watched the 1982 theatrical and 1999 TV movie versions of this musical and I remember enjoying both of those. So now I just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend and an aunt of his and we all enjoyed this one as well. Quvenzhane Wallis-a native of the state I currently live in, Louisiana-is fine both acting and singing the title role. Most of the songs are either modernized or have some lyric changes. The arrangement and dancing for ""It's The Hard Knock Life"" is well done and many of the other numbers are pretty enjoyable though the last number probably could have used some more bombastic power. Still, this was still an enjoyable version of the classic story with nice turns also from Jamie Foxx, Rose Byrne, Cameron Diaz, among others. So on that note, this version of Annie is worth a look.",Annie
7,sunwarrior13,Annie:The 2014 Version,6,13 November 2016,"Quvenzhané Wallis stars in the lead role in this modern retelling of the stage musical and 1982 musical film entitled Annie together with Jamie Foxx,Rose Byrne,Bobby Cannavale and Cameron Diaz.Adding the 1999 Disney TV movie,this happens to be the third film adaptation of the stage musical of the same title.Will Gluck directed the film and co-wrote the screenplay with Aline Brosh McKenna.The year is 2014.Annie,a young and happy foster kid,has proved that she is tough enough to make her way in the streets of New York. She knew that her parents left her as a foster kid but has always had the optimistic attitude that she is going to meet them someday.What adds to her positive attitude and optimism is having a mean foster mom in Miss Hannigan. Things begin to look bright for Annie when a campaign move made by a determined New York mayoral candidate and hard-nosed tycoon begins to take in foster kids in his home through the advise of his campaign team made up of Grace and Guy.Included among the foster kids taken is Annie.Well,no question that Quvenzhané Wallis is truly deserving of her Academy Award nomination for she was happy and enthusiastic as Annie.Her performance brought out a lot of happiness in the movie despite of the film's numerous flaws.No question that there was a lot dissatisfaction in this 2014 version due to the clichéd ridden characters and the predictability it had when it portrayed distasteful materialism. Too bad that the filmmakers did not take into consideration the time the movie was released nor the current situation that the country already has in 2014.It only changed when the time of the story took place but it remained in the situation during the time when Annie was first released during the Great Depression era back in the 1930's.Realism was definitely lacking in it.",Annie
8,studioAT,A modern 'Annie',5,7 July 2017,"Having not seen any of the other film adaptations of 'Annie' or indeed the stage show I was actually one of the few perhaps who could watch this film with an open mind without constantly thinking ""oh they did this better in this version..."" I found this modern 'Annie' to be a warm hearted film, one in which everyone breaks into song, yes, but for a reason.It's a simple story told well, and a lot of that credit goes to writer/director, Will Gluck, who controls all the important plot points/moments well.I enjoyed this film.",Annie
9,utgard14,"""I don't eat hobo food.""",4,18 January 2015,"Well, it's a remake and we all know how much they tend to suck. So I didn't get my hopes up going into this. Ultimately I found myself liking parts I didn't expect to like and hating parts I thought the movie would get right. The hated would, of course, be the music. The wonderful songs from the original musical have been raped here, updated to reflect today's soulless music market. Everything is drowned in overproduction and all that auto tune synth beat crap. I'm searching for an analogy for this travesty but the closest I think of is when a perfectly attractive and youthful actress starts butchering herself with plastic surgery and Botox. There was nothing wrong with the songs as they were and they should have been left alone. The few new songs here are wretched. I watched with my girlfriend and every time we were enjoying the movie a damn song would start and we would both groan loudly.The cast and the way they interacted with one another was the best part. I enjoyed Jamie Foxx a lot, which always surprises me as I never know what to expect from him. His channeling R. Kelly in the musical numbers was a little cheesy, though. Quvenzhané Wallis is hit or miss for me. I liked her but the forced smile throughout the movie felt a bit like mugging. Bobby Cannavale, Rose Byrne, and David Zayas are all good. Cameron Diaz was over the top and not in a fun way. The script is not impressive but there were some nice bits of humor throughout and (mostly) likable characters. The fake movie ""Moonquake Lake"" they went to see was the highlight of the film. Also, for a movie dripping with anti-capitalist rhetoric and (laughable) comparisons between the present and the Great Depression, it sure is very materialistic and shallow.",Annie
10,anaconda-40658,Isn't Annie Notable for Her Curly Red Hair?,2,4 March 2016,"Annie (2014): Dir: Will Gluck / Cast: Quvenzhane Wallis, Jamie Foxx, Cameron Diaz, Rose Byrne, Bobby Cannavale: Embarrassing remake of the 1982 family classic. This time the characters go through a race change and cast the talented yet hindered Quvenzhane Wallis as orphan Annie. She sings and dances, which annoys her ruthless caregiver, played by Cameron Diaz. When she is pulled from a possible hit by a car, she discovers her rescuer is a politician, played by Jamie Foxx, whose attempts at running for Mayor are drastically going wrong. Encouraged by his assistants, he uses the opportunity to build his popularity in the media until predictably he becomes attached to Annie. Viewers can see the ending coming from the first ten minutes but it is nauseating just to sit through several forgettable dance numbers. Will Gluck directed one good film, which is Easy A. With Friends With Benefits and Fired Up added with this musical sh*t storm, he manages to strike out. With dance numbers turning up out of no where viewers are left with colorful sets and empty headed writing. The cast is stranded with idiotic dialogue that makes everyone sound like a moron. Wallis sprung to fame in The Beasts of the Southern Wild, but here her charm fails to drown out the phony delivery. Foxx does what he can with the forced material. Diaz has the one good number called, ""Who Am I"" but her cruel nature grows over the top. Rose Byrnes plays Foxx's assistant and hinted romantic interest whose role has her as a tongue tied idiot. Bobby Cannavale overacts as Foxx's scheming political adviser. Result is an imbecilic musical mess that should be buried deep. Score: 2 / 10",Annie
11,StevePulaski,Nails nearly everything except having a soul,4,29 December 2014,"Will Gluck's Annie remake has all the motions it needs to be successful, from a great cast of actors who have proved to be capable and talented before, nice cinematography thanks to the likes of Michael Grady, and extremely slick editing by Tia Nolan, who matches every song with a finely-trimmed, briskly-paced compilation of shots that effectively churn out a delightful rigor to the project. However, the film lacks one thing that would pull it up to the level of recommendation and noteworthiness and that is a soul. The film, despite having strong components here and there, looks, feels, sounds, and moves not like a giddy adaptation of a classic story, but a micromanaged studio project that lacks authenticity in its emotions and beneath its candy-colored textures lies heaping amounts of artificiality, like a falsely-advertised supplement or sports drink.The classic story of Annie needs no reiteration, but here, writers Gluck and Aline Brosh McKenna tweak things slightly; the film focuses on Annie (played by Oscar-nominated Beasts of the Southern Wild actress Quvenzhané Wallis, making this film the first to showcase an African-American Annie), a young orphan who lives in a foster home with several other young children and is commanded by her mean-spirited, often hungover foster mother Colleen Hannigan (Cameron Diaz). Despite having such a dour situation, Annie keeps a positive outlook on life, clinging towards the idea she'll meet her biological parents one day, holding a letter written by them and a locket showing half of a heart as her memories of them. One day, Annie is racing down the busy streets of New York when she trips into the street and is almost hit by a speeding car, only to be narrowly saved by Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx), a wealthy politician campaigning to win the mayoral race. Immediately after rescuing Annie, Stacks and his bumbling crew (Rose Byrne and Bobby Cannavale) suggest using Annie has a pictorial staple to Stacks' so far ho-hum campaign; having Annie on board would presumably liven the emotional element sorely lacking from Stacks' campaign and would reinvigorate his image with positivity and sensitivity.Annie doesn't mind essentially being used because she finally gets to leave the clutches of a needy, controlling foster mother, and we can quietly hint that she knows she has the ability to reach Stacks in his heart. She's too young to truly understand the corrupt and often dishonest nature of politicians, and sees everyone through eyes of earnestness that many kids do. Her free-spirit is her best friend in this case, and the film follows the relationship that unfolds between these two opposites.For starters, the music in the film is greatly hit and miss, but the energy it provides is always welcomed, predominately because it disrupts from the mediocrity of the exposition and acting. The music provides the life of the film, and I'll be damned if the new rendition of ""It's a Hard Knock Life"" wasn't arguably the best film adaptation of that song that I have yet to see (yes, I did see the 1982 and 1999 versions as well). However, other songs like ""Easy Street"" and ""Who Am I?"" are smothered by grating autotune, which only heightens my comment about the rampant artificiality with the film as a whole. Nonetheless, the songs of the film provide for momentary escapism in a film that is otherwise grounded in boring and often cheesy safeness.Returning to my point about the acting and exposition, Annie's coffin-sealing nail is how lame its performances are. Everyone from Foxx, Byrne, and even Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, who showed promise in The Inevitable Defeat of Mister & Pete and Pompeii this year, feel like they're slumming their performances in search for a hefty paycheck. Nobody seems to be committing to anything worthwhile in the film, and any evident optimism is crushed by a safe, antiseptic screenplay. The only soul with some heart here is Wallis, but even she seems bored and unchallenged at times, and how couldn't she? The perky eleven-year-old who was awarded a nomination for Best Actress at the Academy Awards for a complex and natural performance in a sleeper hit just two years ago is now being asked to comply with obvious and somewhat manipulative emotional material brought forth in a remake of a remake of a stage-play. I'd be bored out of my mind too.The other performer here showing some heart is Diaz, playing one of her only villainous roles in recent memory. While over-the-top and a bit too manic at times, Diaz still effectively manages to pull off an incorrigible character, and proves that her liveliness can handle just about any type of material. With that, Will Gluck's Annie will likely be what many parents will treat their little tikes to over the holiday weekend and the first couple weeks of the new year; meanwhile, Big Hero 6 is starting to wind down, playing to more and more empty seats and need I remind you that Netflix and Redbox have made finding and watching older films easier? There are not only more thoughtful options for your kids, but there are healthier ones too, and while Annie isn't as bad as some of the loathsome, ""fast-food filmmaking"" I've panned in the past, it's nonetheless burdened by its own cloying motions and rampant silliness to really pass for something much higher in rank.Starring: Quvenzhané Wallis, Jamie Foxx, Rose Byrne, Bobby Cannavale, and Cameron Diaz.

12,Hellmant,The 1982 version is much better.,5,15 December 2014,"'ANNIE': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Modern-day adaptation of the 1977 Broadway musical (of the same name), which was based on the 1924 comic strip 'Little Orphan Annie'. It stars Quvenzhane Wallis (of 'BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD' fame), as Annie, and Jamie Foxx, as billionaire Will Stacks (an update on the Daddy Warbucks character, from the comic and musical). It costars Rose Byrne, Cameron Diaz, Bobby Cannavale, David Zayas and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. It was directed by Will Gluck (who also directed 'EASY A' and 'FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS') and written by Gluck and Aline Brosh McKenna. I don't think it's nearly as enjoyable as the 1982 film version (which I grew up on) but the music is still good (and there's three new songs).The story, once again, centers on a ten-year-old orphan named Annie (Wallis). She lives at the home of a mean alcoholic, named Colleen Hannigan (Diaz), with four other foster children. Colleen is very abusive to the kids, constantly making them clean her apartment, and only takes care of them so she can collect money from the state. Annie dreams of being reunited with her parents, who promised they'd come back for her (long ago). She runs into New York City mayoral candidate Will Stacks (Foxx), while running home one day, and falls to the ground in the streets. Stacks saves her from being hit, by a truck, and the incident is caught on video. The video then goes viral and Stacks sees it as an excellent opportunity to save his failing campaign. An odd relationship develops between the two.The film is filled with corny jokes, and bad acting, and it's even more cheesy than the 1982 movie (which I still love, for nostalgic reasons). The music is great, still though (especially my favorite: 'It's the Hard Knock Life'), and the movie does have a positive and upbeat message for kids (like it's source material). It's other saving grace is Quvenzhane Wallis, who has some really powerful scenes (towards the end of the film). She could have delivered another award worthy performance, if her part had been written a little better (she is nominated for a Golden Globe though, but doesn't quite deserve it). For those reasons the movie isn't horrible but the 1982 version is much better.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/GmFPW994ONg",Annie
13,kfo9494,It was a hard knock life to view this movie,2,21 December 2014,"I guess if you are a child and do not know any better then this movie may, for some odd reason, be entertaining. But if you have any wits, above a teenager, then you know this movie will be on DVD at some discount store barrel in the near future.The story of Annie, which is known to most, is that an orphan that is stuck living with a care-taker that is more interested in money than the welfare of the kids. And soon the girl finds happiness through riches while impressing a well-to-do bachelor. It is a classic fairy tale.In this 2014 tale, the child (Quvenzhané Wallis) meets a man (Jamie Foxx) that is running for mayor of New York and has a image problem. When Annie shows up on the scene, the ratings of Foxx goes up so he keeps her around his rich lifestyle. And all along the way we have a song and dance show that is revved up with the energy of a 'Red Bull' drink with a side order of espresso. But it was the songs and dance routine that made this show depressing.Between Jamie Foxx 'spit-takes' and the almost continuous glued-on smile of Quvenzhané Wallis, the staged songs were more of a choreographed induced tantrum that a musical number. And when they did the song while in the helicopter, it just became sad to the ninth degree.Here is a good way to judge most musicals. When leaving the theater you still have one or two songs that you cannot get out of your head. The message that I had in my head was 'Tomorrow'. But it was not the song, it was that tomorrow I will never have to think of this movie again.",Annie
14,Robert_duder,"For a new generation, it isn't so bad",7,11 January 2015,"You had to know that anyone who loves the original 1982 film would find this abhorrent. I didn't because I went in with proper expectations. If you go in holding onto the memories and spirit of the original determined to hate this then you will. I looked at it from a different perspective. If I were a young person (12 and under) who had no prior experience to the Annie story and went and saw this then I could completely understand if they loved it. Its cute and fun and has a good story and best of all, it still has the general concept of Annie firmly in tact. It is completely turned on its head for a new generation BUT thankfully didn't feel the need to turn to rap or R&B music to do so. The fact that much of the main cast including Annie is African American doesn't matter even a little bit. There are plenty of white characters, its not a Tyler Perry film. To me the issue is that it doesn't have the same heart as the original and they did keep a few of the iconic songs in tact (it would have been a complete disaster if they hadn't or even if they had remixed them) but the new songs they added don't have nearly the same iconic vibe as the original. Also I felt like the story of Annie loses a little something by not being set in the 1940's. For anyone who loves the original, you will miss certain aspects of it but for a new generation this one is okay.I wasn't sure what to expect from Quvenzhané Wallis as Annie. She blew everyone away in Beasts of The Southern Wild but this was a totally different role. Well Wallis proves she is an up and comer once again. She is actually really great as Annie. She has a lovely voice (probably significantly digitized but still good) she is adorable and fun and fits the role well. I wouldn't say she has quite the chemistry and its a very demanding role that I'm not sure she was quite suited for but she fills the shoes well. I'm not a fan of Cameron Diaz but sometimes she does good films. She is decent as Ms. Hannigan but she tries way too hard. She is trying to capture the spirit of Carol Burnett's mind blowing performance 30+years ago and no one ever could. Sometimes she is campy and over the top and sometimes she pulls it off. At best she is okay as Hannigan but I'm not sure anyone could do it perfectly if you've seen the original. Jamie Foxx is a highlight in the movie. He gives a terrific performance as Daddy Warbucks stand-in Will Stacks. His gradual emotional softening isn't in your face and its believable and the chemistry between he and Wallis is very good. They should have had him perform more but he gets a lot of great lines and is definitely the best performance in the film. I also very much enjoyed Rose Byrne in a supporting role as Stack's assistant. Her role is very sweet and she also has very good chemistry with Wallis. Their performance together of ""I Think I'm Going To Like It Here"" was one of the best scenes in the movie. Byrne doesn't sing well...she really struggles on that front but she still fits into the film well enough. Bobby Cannavale is solid as the story's villain but he is a little underused so he is more a joke than a viable bad guy. David Zayas and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje are very underused in small supporting roles that should have been more significant.Will Gluck is an amazing comedy director. I based that on two films but two outstanding films. Friends With Benefits and Easy A were smart and well made and had amazing casts. This film needed a director who understood the ins and outs of a musical. They needed someone familiar with Broadway or has successfully translated a musical to the big screen. Gluck lacks the proper vision for this type of film which is why sometimes the film feels almost like its mocking itself. The opening scene (which is actually very cheeky and smart) shows a spunky red head who would be more suited to the original idea of Annie being shuffled aside to make way for Wallis. Its a clever nod to the new concept. The things that Gluck did right was to keep the iconic songs in play (although I was a little disappointed in only one performance of ""Tomorrow"" and it felt misplaced) the story is good, the characters are okay but the new songs fail to inspire, the casting wasn't good enough and it stumbles too much. Still Annie isn't the disaster everyone would have it made out to be. People are far too harsh and go in with improper expectations. Take your kiddies, have a great time and then show them the original after. 7/10",Annie
15,inkblot11,"Great cast, especially Foxx and Wallis: but the script and direction stumbles and trips time after time",6,13 October 2015,"Annie (Quvenzhani Wallis) is the well-known orphan, living in Harlem with the meanest foster mother ever, Ms. Hanigan (Cameron Diaz). She longs to find her true parents, who abandoned her at a fire station long ago. So far, her search has led nowhere. One day, Annie is nearly hit by a car but a gazillionaire, Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx), who just happens to be running for mayor, snatches the young gal out of the way. Someone takes a photo, for this is the modern age, and posts it. Sensing a great campaign boost, Stacks' manager (Bobby Cannavale) persuades Will to find and invite Annie to lunch. Once they meet, her orphan existence is so precarious that Mr. Stacks, very reluctantly, invites Annie to live with him, at first as a strategy for the election. With the help of Stacks faithful assistant (Rose Byrne), Annie is soon living the high life and, perhaps, changing Will's life direction. Meanwhile, Ms. Hanigan is miffed that Annie is living large, compared to her, and plots to trick Annie back into the poor house. Can she succeed? This film has the best cast and the concept of a African American Annie movie is so wonderful. Foxx sings, dances and charms while Wallis does the same, pint size. All of the other cast members are just terrific, too. However, the script and direction are so uneven, that even these fine folk get shortchanged as the flick stumbles again and again. Also, anyone loving the musical should go prepared to find every song shortened and, almost, afterthoughts. What a shame since the music is most wonderful. On the plus side, the sets, costumes, and photography are quite nice. All in all, this viewer was a bit letdown at her showing. Nevertheless, Foxx and Wallis make the movie better than the material.",Annie
16,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,5,14 March 2015,"AnnieThe key to getting adopted from a foster home is dressing up like a sad puppy on visitor day.Mind you, the foster kid in this musical doesn't have to wear a furry get-up to get parents.When 10-year-old Annie (Quvenzhané Wallis) is auspiciously pulled from harm's way by cell- phone magnet and mayoral candidate Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx), he convinces her to hangout with him as a means of boasting his public standing.Strictly business at first, Stacks eventually warms to the new addition in his life.However, Annie's jealous den mother (Cameron Diaz) isn't about to let her have any happiness.Taking great liberties not only with the songs tempos but also much of the lyrics, this modernization of the 1930s radio heroin has been corrupted by political incorrectness and turned into a sterile, materialist, amateurish cash grab.Besides, rich people only adopt orphans for their blood's anti-aging properties.

It's a Hard Knock Life for us, yet again!",5,7 March 2015,"I always had a likely to those Broadway stage plays in 1972 by Charles Strouse, Martin Charnin and Thomas Meehan which in turn, is based on Little Orphan Annie, the 1924 comic strip by Harold Gray which in turn, was originally a poem by James Whitcomb Riley. While, the 1982 & 1999 movie with the same name didn't live up to the stage version; I always found them to be alright adaptations. I can't say, the same with this movie and it's over complicated plot. Directed by Will Gluck, the movie tells the story of Annie Bennett (Quvenzhané Wallis), a foster child that became a huge media sensation, after being pulled away from a truck's path, by cell phone maker, billionaire and New York City mayoral candidate, William Stacks (Jamie Foxx). Due to this popularity, Stacks with his brilliant VP, Grace (Rose Byrne) and his shrewd and scheming campaign adviser, Guy (Bobby Cannavale) decide to make Annie's guardian, Stacks, so that they might gain the supported the NYC crowd to win the election. Annie gets hold of this, and decide to play along as their political pawn, in return that Stacks help find her real parents. Will Annie find her real parents or will Stacks play her off as a fool? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling too much of this. This movie really destroy the simple previous well-establish plot thread by one horrible change. They eliminated and change the main villain, from Miss Hannigan's scummy cousin, Rooster Hannigan to a new character like Guy. It made the movie way more complex and cause headache fuel plot-holes than this movie needed to be. I'll tell you why. It was Guy's good idea that allowed Annie to stay with Stacks, in the first place. Then, later in the film for some odd lame reason, Guy change his mind, and hacked a scheme to get a fake couple to pretend to be her long lost parents so that Stacks can lost Annie. The reason for this sharp turn by him is very confusing. At first, it seem like it was to get even more supported from the people, but it's later, explain that he did this for more money. What? Where did this come from? Stacks never put reward money on the line to find her parents, like the first two movies. It's not like Guy needed the money, anyways. He was going to be rich, no matter, what happen. It really makes no sense. Unlike others, I didn't mind the modern setting or that Annie was being played by an African-American. I didn't mind, the whole remix Hip-Hop, R&B vibe to the Broadway music. I thought, maybe this might work, but after watching it. I was dumbfounded on how much the movie strayed away too far from the source material. It focus way too much on politics, the media, and product placement. It clearly wanted to tackle bigger issues. It was never about those issues. It was about Christmas and allowing guests into your heart for the holidays. It takes away, all the morality, and replaced it with unlikeable ego. The movie is full of annoying mean-spirited humor and over the top not needed pop culture references filler scenes like the movie watching scene. The worst, had to be the Hurricane Sandy, joke. The movie jokes are just slowly-delivered. It takes forever to get to the punch-line and by that time, it's really unfunny. The movie pacing, really hurts because of this, as you can see with the third act, where most of the lazy writing is done. You can tell that they didn't have enough time to finish any of the sub-plots like Annie's dyslexia or Grace's love affair with Stacks, because they either abandoned it or had a rush weak conclusion. The movie went a little too long with a 118 minute time range. The music is a hit and miss. I love re-listening to all the Broadway hits, like ""Maybe"", ""It's a Hard Knock Life' & ""Tomorrow"" on the big screen. I didn't mind, that Sia and Greg Kurstin, the music producers change the beat and lyrics to Broadway songs like 'Little Girls', 'I think I'm Gonna like it here"" & 'Easy Street'. While, it's wasn't good, at least, they didn't butcher it. The new songs like ""Opportunity"", ""Who Am I"" and ""Moonquake Lake"" weren't that good. The lyrics to the song ""The City's Yours"" is insulting, because it felt like they were saying New York City belongs to the rich. I really don't think people would like to hear songs about how rich, they are, when so many are poor. I would rather take original cut song, ""NYC"" over this song. About the cast, this cast is probably the weakest of the three adaptations films, because they lack the singing voice and dance moves. They barely able to sing without auto tone. They can't even dance in most of these sequences. Wallis was alright, but she's not in Aileen Quinn's adorable and talented. I have to say, Jamie Foxx as William Stacks AKA Daddy Warbucks is a lot more human than the over the top cartoony, Albert Finney of the 1982 version, yet he lack passion and emotion. Still, I have to say, 1999's performance by Victor Garber is by far, the best version, I saw, yet. Cameron Diaz as Miss Hannigan is a train-wreck and the worst performance of the film. She was so much better in 2011's Bad Teacher. She wasn't funny, nor very likable in this film. I really miss Carol Burnett's take on Miss Hannigan. Overall: After watching this movie, I felt that it was below average than the standards, I can with stand. I don't think, it's a horrible movie like other critics has said. I just found parts of it, very annoying, mean-spirited, and not pleasure. Don't recommended.",Annie
18,leonblackwood,Bad remake! 2/10,2,24 May 2015,"Review: I really couldn't stand this film. The original is so much better and the way that they changed the songs were awful. I know that I shouldn't be saying this, but I found the little girl a bit annoying and the over happy storyline, also got on my nerves. Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz wasn't that bad along with Rose Byrne and Bobby Cannavale but I really struggled to keep my eyes open, especially when the characters burst into song. I know that it's made for the kiddies and that they will be singing along to the tunes so from that point of view, the movie did work, but for entertainment for an adult, it really wasn't a good updated version of an all time classic. The cinematography, which is primarily set in New York, was filmed well and choreography was decent but I'm not a big fan of musicals so I should have known that I wasn't going to enjoyed it. Disappointing!Round-Up: Now that all of these big stars are having kids, like Jay Z who produced the movie, they all want to make songs and films that the kids can watch and listen too, so I can understand why the film was made. Although I didn't really like a majority of the songs, I did like Opportunity, which was quite an emotional song, but the rest of them made me cringe. Anyway, I think that you can tell that I didn't enjoy this movie but I can understand that there will be a certain type of audience that will watch it time and time again. I'm sure if I had kids, I would be seeing this movie from another point of view but I just couldn't get into it. Budget: $65million Worldwide Gross: $134millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their comedy/musicals about a young girl who lives in a foster home and gets taken in by a millionaire mayor candidate so it will boost his votes. 2/10",Annie

20,digitalbeachbum,"Worst remake, reboot, rehash movie of 2014",1,19 April 2015,"I dislike reboots especially when the original story is changed dramatically to fit the need to fit mis-cast actors in to characters who don't belong in the original story. Movies like the remake of 'The Karate Kid 2010' so is 'Annie 2014' The story is changed so dramatically as to change the chemistry of the original characters that it becomes a rip-off story because no one in Hollywood is original any more. They need to reboot so that they can make money off the ignorant and the kids.The #1 dislike of this entire movie is that the character played by Cameron Diaz has been completely changed and her story has changed just so that Cameron Diaz can have more lines and more singing numbers. I also dislike the story for Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx) as the mysterious Daddy Warbucks has been removed completely. There is no mystery to Will Stacks. He is a typical telecommunication tycoon running for office. Boring.The only saving grace to this entire movie is Quvenzhané Wallis who plays Annie. She gives the screen a shake up from the typical red head Caucasian Annie and her scenes are pretty good even though she is dealing with terrible writing.For kids they will like the movie, mine did, however it sucked for me and I never ever will get the movie out of me no matter how many times I wash.

Cameron Diaz who I thought was gonna be miscast as Ms Hannigan, but was surprisingly good, after a string of bad performances, this might be her comeback. Rose Byrne was also great.

23,stevendbeard,New Updated Musical,6,13 December 2014,"I saw ""Annie"", starring Quvenzhane Wallis-12 Years a Slave, Beasts of the Southern Wild; Jamie Foxx-The Horrible Bosses movies, White House Down; Rose Byrne-Neighbors, 28 Weeks Later and Cameron Diaz-The Other Woman, Bad Teacher.This is the third movie adaptation-the first was in 1982 and the second was in 1999-of the Broadway play which is about a foster child being adopted by a rich man. Oh, in this version, Annie is called a foster child instead of an orphan-I guess it sounds more politically correct or something-and Daddy Warbucks is now called Benjamin Stacks. It is also still a musical, so it has it's fair share of songs. This movie is produced by Will and Jada Pinkett Smith, who had originally planned for their daughter Willow to play Annie, but she dropped out, after she started getting a little too old for the part. Quvenzhane plays Annie, a foster child that is living under the foster care of Cameron. Jamie is the rich businessman-he made his fortune in the now more updated mobile phone business-that crosses paths with Quvenzhane and decides it would be in his best interest to adopt her; Jamie is running for the office of mayor and it makes him look more family friendly to voters. Rose is an assistant-and love interest-to Jamie. There is also a side story about Quvenzhane searching for her real parents. There are a few nods to the other Annie versions. If you look closely during Cameron's scene in a night club, you will see a musical group's drums on the stage, with Leapin' Lizards emblazoned on it. Sandy the dog does make an appearance, and there is a scene after the credits. It's rated ""PG"" for rude humor and some mild language and has a running time of 1 hour & 58 minutes.

It was one of the films I rewatched the most as a child along with The Goonies and the Disney cartoons. So despite hearing some negative reviews, I still was excited about getting to watch the Annie remake for nostalgic reasons. One of my favorite films of 2012 was Beasts of the Southern Wild, so my expectations were even higher when I heard Quvenzhane Wallis was going to play Annie. Wallis is a force to reckon with and the perfect choice for Annie. This remake (which actually turned out to be more of a modern re-imagining) was directed by Will Gluck, whose latest films (Easy A, Friends with Benefits) I actually enjoyed. So all these elements combined, drew me into wanting to see it despite the very negative word of mouth. My expectations weren't matched of course because Annie turned out to be a very flawed film, but I didn't hate this musical either. Wallis's performance was strong enough to keep me engaged with the story despite all the cheesy dialogues. The biggest disappointment for me however, were the musicals which felt too produced and at times those scenes felt more like a music video clip from MTV than anything else. The story is cliché and familiar, but at the same time it remains family friendly and it has a few emotional moments thrown in as well. For a flawed film, I found myself enjoying it quite a bit, but that was probably due to the nostalgic factor and my love for Wallis. The cast of Annie is pretty solid, although there were some performances that didn't work at all. Cameron Diaz is miscast in the film, playing Miss Hannigan, the guardian of the orphan girls. She goes completely over the top and got on my nerves almost in every scene she was in. She is a great actress, but this sort of cartoonish role which she's played many times in the past, never works for her. I find her obnoxious every time she plays these exaggerated parts. The same could be said about Bobby Cannavale who never sells his role. I know that the weak screenplay was responsible for this, but the rest of the cast didn't turn out that bad. David Mayas, Adele Akinnuoye-Agbaje, and Jamie Foxx are solid, but the standouts in this film were Wallis and Rose Byrne. They both bring a unique sweetness and charm to their role necessary for a musical like this. Byrne is a talented actress, and she is one of the best things about Annie. Unfortunately, the music never works and the screenplay is uninspired, but I still found most of the film entertaining and tolerable. I've seen a lot worse this year.",Annie
26,pixrox1,It's hard to make an honest billion . . .,8,22 December 2014,". . . as ANNIE proves to us. Jamie Foxx as ""Will Stacks"" has struggled to make just $4.3 billion, with all the overhead doing business in America requires. Just placing his cell phone transmitters in locations such as the Statue of Liberty's crown and the Chrysler Building's rooftop gargoyles no doubt requires a billion or two in ongoing bribes. Will probably also pays more in school taxes than 100,000 typical New Yorkers combined. Yet when he takes one random ten-year-old public school student under his care, it turns out that the ONLY thing she's learned in five years is how to create a classroom disturbance. Therefore, he must hire a tutor to bring a four-years-behind ANNIE up to speed (which smacks of double taxation). As ANNIE so well illustrates, the stress of managing what little profits billionaires have left (after paying their ""overhead"" expenses) makes it very difficult for them to hold down any solid food. Will barfs more times here than any film star has in one movie since Linda Blair was exorcised. As they sing in ANNIE, ""It's a hard knock life!""",Annie
27,r96sk,"Poor, all in all",5,30 November 2020,"Not for the lack of effort, but 'Annie' isn't good.I've admittedly never seen the original musical, not that I think that's necessary anyway. I like the cast, while the songs are alright - if cringey. Everything else is either slow, predictable or straight up boring. It might've, perhaps, worked better as a flat out drama - though then they'd get hate for changing things, I guess.As noted, the onscreen talent stopped this from falling far down my ratings. Jamie Foxx and Rose Byrne are two actors I enjoy, I found them satisfactory in this - could've been better, could've been worse. Quvenzhané Wallis is more than decent in the lead, while David Zayas is solid.Cameron Diaz is, however, truly awful - and that's coming from someone who likes Diaz; she's very good in films like 'Shrek', 'Knight and Day' and 'Bad Teacher' but this is certainly the worst I've seen from her - it's a shame that she went out with this as well as the dreadful and overall inferior 'Sex Tape'.Despite me rating (most of) the cast themselves, I don't think the casting itself is anything praisable. Foxx, Byrne and Diaz are not three actors I'd immediately think of if I was making a musical - a few of their songs are a tad ropey.Poor, all in all.",Annie
28,3xHCCH,"Sassy, Spunky and Spirited",6,23 January 2015,"The original ""Annie"" was a character in a fictional cartoon strip called ""Little Orphan Annie"" by Harold Gray. This strip was very popular back then during the Great Depression not only because of its story of red- haired, blank eyed Annie, her dog Sandy and her benefactor Daddy Warbucks, but also because it would have commentary on various political topics. In 1977, a musical entitled ""Annie"" based on characters of the cartoon strip debuted on Broadway. It won the Tony Award for Best Musical and ran for six years, giving us very popular songs like ""Tomorrow"" and ""It's a Hard Knock Life.""In 1982, a film version of the musical ""Annie"" was released with Aileen Quinn as the redhead orphan girl. It also stars Albert Finney as (Daddy Warbucks) and Carol Burnett (as Miss Hannigan). This film had mixed reviews but was the 10th highest grossing film of 1982 nonetheless. An Emmy-award winning TV movie version of Annie was broadcast in 1999, with Alicia Morton (as Annie), Victor Garber (as Daddy Warbucks) and Kathy Bates (as Miss Hannigan).This recent incarnation of Annie updates the story of the 1977 musical from the Depression to modern times. It was also surprised audiences with the radically unconventional casting choice of having African- American child actress Quvenzhané Wallis as Annie!Annie is one of the foster children under the care of mean and drunk has-been musician Miss Hannigan in her apartment in Harlem. Mr. Will Stacks is a wealthy cell phone magnate unsuccessfully running for mayor of New York City. One day, Mr. Stacks saved Annie from being hit by a van. When a video of this deed was uploaded on the net, the ratings of Stacks skyrocket in the polls. To gain further media mileage, Stacks proceeded to take temporary guardianship of Annie. However, as Annie and Stacks grow more and more fond of each other, fate seems to have other plans.Admittedly it took some getting used to at first, but little Quvenzhané Wallis eventually convinces us that she was a good choice to be Annie. This girl first gained attention as Hushpuppy in the Oscar-nominated indie film ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" in 2012, which was filmed when she was only six years old. In fact, Wallis was even nominated for Best Actress, the youngest ever with that honor at the age of nine. As Annie, Wallis was sassy, spunky and spirited. Her singing voice was good enough in her solos like ""Tomorrow"" and ""Opportunity."" Jamie Foxx was made to deliver some lame lines, but overall he was both dapper and funny as Mr. Sparks. He also got to show off his smooth singing voice in the song ""This City's Yours"" which he sang while Stacks was touring Annie over NYC by helicopter. He shares a good chemistry with Wallis as their dramatic scenes hit home.Cameron Diaz can split opinions about her over-the-top performance as Ms. Hannigan. She plays a hateful character, but personally, I liked the way Diaz played her. The writers also added the cute touch she was once a soloist in C+C Music Company! Aside from her solo song ""Little Girls"", she also shines vocally in the song ""Who Am I?"", which she sings with Foxx and Wallis.Rose Byrne was very sweet as Grace, Stack's loyal personal assistant. Bobby Cannavale was slimy as Guy, Stack's ruthless political adviser. Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje plays Nash, Stack's imposing but kind driver. David Zayas plays Lou, the owner of a neighborhood store who has a crush on Miss Hannigan.Honestly, I was expecting it to be really bad because of the very negative reviews given it. However, while watching, I found it generally charming and delightful, thanks to the charisma of its stars. The modern pop hiphop arrangement of the songs and the updating of the storyline with gadgets and social media, were both very cool. This film is mainly geared for young audiences, hence the simplistic storytelling by director Will Gluck. Little girls especially will really like it. 6/10.",Annie

30,jadepietro,It's a Hard-Knock Film,1,13 January 2015,"This film is not recommended.Annie, Will Gluck's musical film, and I am using that term loosely, is wrong-headed in concept and execution. After two vain attempts to film the successful Broadway hit, this latest version sucks all the life and last glimmers of hope that was so evident in the original production. Updated to present-day NYC, this new updated version Whereas, the Broadway musical had buckets of charm, a great score sung by talented performers that stressed comedy, and a book that clung to the nostalgic memories of the twenties, this debacle has anti-charm, alters the score with synthesized percussion and bombastic orchestrations, distorts songs so poorly crooned by non-singers (with the sole exception of Mr. Foxx who has some vocal talents and rhythm), and a dumbed-down script that resorts to food-spitting as high comedy (at least three times). It's just awful.The screenplay by Aline Brosh McKenna and the director never finds the right footing. In this Annie, our plucky heroine is not an orphan, but a foster child in search of her parents. She is still living with the self-absorbed Miss Hannigan, now a wash-up singer from the 90's pop group, C +C Music Factory. Daddy Warbucks becomes Will Stacks, a germaphobic businessman running for mayor. They meet and Annie becomes his photo opportunity until his heart is melted by this young ragamuffin. The film uses the original source as an outline, losing all the clever repartee and creating new dialog that is contemporary sounding for all the worse reasons. (Example: When looking for the dog, Sandy, to adopt, Stacks says to Annie: ""Don't pick that one! It's licking its own who-ha."" Moments of this sophistication just can't express my total displeasure with this film adaptation.)Gluck's heavy-handed direction is everywhere. No one can escape it. The director can't stage a scene with any musical flair. The dancing is sloppy, the singing merely adequate, and the acting settles into non-stop mugging. The wondrous score from Charlie Strouse and Martin Charnin is as diluted as the filmmakers. Many of the musical numbers are throwaway moments and never build to anything resembling entertainment. (Only one song, It's a Hard- Knock Life, at least, has some energy and fun.) Quvenzhané Wallis plays the title role and she does look cute enough to play Annie, but she has a limited vocal range and comes off as saccharine and insincere. The aforementioned Mr. Foxx has some style, but is given little to do except look grumpy and bothered until he transforms, due to his love for the little tyke, into a lovesick sap. As Stack's helpful crew, Rose Bryne is wasted and Bobby Cannavale is an embarrassment of riches. Coming off worse of all is Cameron Diaz playing Miss Hannigan. It would be unfair to compare her performance to the legendary Dorothy Loudon. Let's just say Ms. Diaz is just loud and leave it at that. (That she plays this beloved villain as cruel and seriously hateful only shows her misinterpretation of the role and serious miscasting of the part of Mr. Gluck.) Sadly, this film is one-stop- shopping to find these actors' worst performance in their careers.The film has the New York vibe, but it seems to be in its own alternate universe, gritty but not too gritty, real, but not too real. The production design by Marcia Hinds is dreadful (Stacks' penthouse looks like a modern architecture horror inspired by George Jetson.), the costumes by Renee Ehrlich Kalfus are unflattering and do little to endear the characters, and the cinematography by Michael Grady is bland at best.Perhaps, I should stop here, looking toward a better tomorrow when the sun will come up once again. But this feel-good movie just made me feel all so bad. So, I will end with this warning: Taking your family to see this film is a form of child abuse. This Annie deserves to be alone.

Annie also asks Stacks' staff Nash to try to find her parents using the mobile communications resources. One night Stacks brings Annie to a function party, where he lets Annie talks on stage. Her talk and singing charm the audience. But after that Annie runs from the party as Guy asks her to read a formal speech to lift up Stacks' name from a teleprompter.From this Stacks learns that Annie actually can't read but she hides it very well all this time. Guy finds out about Annie asking Nash a favor. Guy then goes to Hannigan to help him in finding actors to play as Annie's parents to fake a reunion in order to crank Stacks' electability. Annie manages to have Stacks and Grace dress up and they compliment each other. Stacks soon begins thinking about really adopting Annie. But without Stacks knowing Guy has already found his actors and tell Annie and Stacks about the parents being found. They reunite under press coverage, with Stacks confused whether to be sad or happy. But Hannigan comes to her senses as Stacks tells her how Annie really thinks of her. She ultimately breaks the secrecy to Stacks. On the car with 'her parents', Annie figures out the truth by herself, but they lock the door on her as she tries to get out. Stacks, Grace, Hannigan and the other foster kids look for Annie from the air with Stacks' helicopter. Now quite famous, Annie tried yelling for help with people other cats particularly while they stop at traffic lights, and those people publish photos of her to the social media. Stacks and the group use those photos' location to track Annie down. They eventually get to her, and the fake parents are apprehended. Stacks realize that he has to focus more on things close to him and he announce his withdrawal from the mayoral candidacy and tells his feelings to Grace.Being a second remake of the original 1982 movie, this movie nicely twists the story, adding, reducing and changing some key elements but keeping the main plot line to stay true to the original. The story is being quite a heavy in the essence. Themes such as abandoned children and parent-child reunification were never easy to discuss. But this movie can really turn the table on such a thing. The character design on Annie and the overall focus of the story set between Annie, Stacks and to some extent Grace really can steer the viewers assumption from a sadder initial to a much happier way in viewing the character's problems. It's also done through the help of the dominantly cheerful songs, even the ones on the sadder moments.The family and drama parts of the story fits in nicely as the movie tends to spread its focus from mainly at Annie, into a a wider angle with Stacks and Grace. All those bonding and relationship building scenes are nicely done well enough while keeping the main theme anchored to the movie by showing Annie still keeping her hopes for her parents coming to get her. Also the movie nicely returns back from time to time to Hannigan and the other foster kids, nicely preparing the viewers for the final conflict and ending.The songs are dominantly cheerful, enabling the movie to make the cast to dance as well as sing in the process. What's nice to see is that of the well known cast, except for Bobby Cannavale, gets to sing and dance. Even though maybe the singing parts can be retouched by audio techniques, at least they get to do the dancing parts, a rare thing to see from those stars. I must say that there are some songs that are strangely placed in the movie. Those misplaced songs feel like they happen out of nowhere, like characters just start singing out of nowhere.The action overall is a decent work. Quvenzhane Wallis did okay in doing a lead role with her character's name as the movie title, which at times can be a greater burden. Jamie Foxx nicely retains his usual character of quite a fast-talker. Rose Byrne again uses her faked British accent, but maybe it's a bit overdone this time. Cameron Diaz did her singing and dancing parts well as she has the most experienced compared to the other cast members, although I think her angry expressions tend to feel overdone.My say is that Annie (2014) is a movie worth something like a 6 out of 10 score. I think this movie will be entertaining and quite fitting to its release timing later at the Christmas holiday season. Quite a nice family drama musical with some comedic touches here and there.",Annie
32,rgkarim,"Fun Adventure, on a Classic Tale",7,23 December 2014,"It's another day in the world of remakes as Hollywood churns out another rendition of a beloved film. This time it is in the form of a beloved musical that focused on an energetic, somewhat annoying, redhead named Annie. In this film, the redhead has been replaced with a lead who had twice the volume, and more of an attitude to lead the assorted cast. Now I'm not a die hard fan of the first film, but I will admit that the trailers did not paint a good picture for this film. A lot of doubts lowered my expectations of what was in store, but nevertheless I scoped out the latest holiday musical. So let's kick into Annie shall we?Director Will Gluck has designed this rendition with a modernized twist, trading in the tap dancing numbers for ones with a little more hip hop kick. Fans that like a bass driven track will enjoy the upbeat dances placed throughout the film, while others will enjoy the slower paced tunes that have a bit more emotion, and instrumental work. Quvenzhané Wallis has a majority of the numbers, and the girl has some pipes and attitude that bring her solos to life. Surprisingly even the talented Jamie Foxx has his own style in the form of an R&B like approach that is smooth, suave, and very fitting for most of his songs. The only thing that may make you cringe is Cameron Diaz's attempts at singing Hannigan's parts, which was only tolerable once drowned out by the chorus music. Regardless of which style, this reviewer feels your family, especially your young ones, will enjoy the autotuned spunk the soundtrack has, and the fun numbers that coincide with it. What does this also mean for the world? Another soundtrack that many kids will continue to repeat over and over again, hopefully not to the extent of Frozen's soundtrack, or so I pray. Outside of the musical numbers, Annie is a cute movie that is fun adventure for the young and young at heart. The young orphan's adventure spans the city streets of New York to capture the dingy, poor slums that many know the series for. I agree with other reviewers that the beginning part is dull, though necessary, as it sets the stage. Many of the numbers are thrown in to get the soundtrack started, and some of the scenes are pointless, in particular the school scene, as they are dropped in an instance. Fortunately, it doesn't take long for the young girl to run in Mr. Stacks (Foxx) who drags us out of the grey and into the HEEEEEEY! Once the two are united, the real fun begins as we take a ride in the luxury side. The incredible penthouse is just the first stop of impressive delights, with a technological set many dream about owning. Following the luxurious home come premiers, fancy restaurants, and helicopter flights all well built to actually have a purpose in the film. Unlike some films that develop backstories and characters with boring, often overdramatic, scenes of randomness, this tale keeps the adventure going as our characters are driven to new roles. While this keeps the movie going, there are some flaws to the editing namely some over sappy moments and a rather pointless dance number near the end that was a bit overdone. Also some rather big events in the movie are blown over, somehow the characters miraculously getting over their problems in a span of seconds. Like how realistic is that? How close to the original is it? There are many references to the old one, and the framework is there, but this rendition has enough of its own flavor that diverges from its predecessor. Another important component to this movie is the acting. Wallis shows her talents once more, and brings the sass, smart mouthed edge to the role that was needed for modern day audiences. Despite her street smarts, Wallis still can bring out a vulnerable side to the character, though sometimes looses the emotion mid-scene and becomes a little monotone. Leading lady Rose Byrne brings her charm to the film, and her kind elegance enlightens the role. Her sweet disposition was perfect for the assistant role, and helps bridge all the characters together in a fun manner. My only flaw with her, is her jokes are always drawn out displays, of awkward comments that lack timing, or originality despite her good delivery. As for Foxx, let's just say the man saves the film, bringing well timed jokes, grand theatrics, and an attitude that makes the character of Stacks. Yet, the man also has the ability to span a variety of emotions from selfish ignorance, to concerned fear, showing he is a chameleon of acting. Unfortunately for Cameron Diaz, the woman is lacking balance in her latest role, falling into an overacted, and ridiculously silly. She puts too much emphasis in her lines, and did not play the drunk role well, rather just an uncoordinated mess with an ugly temper. Yeah Hannigan is supposed to be like this, but the old one has a much better delivery in my opinion. Diaz does get better as the movie continues on as her character evolves from the orphans lessons. Modern day Annie is a fun adventure for the family, and has some great comedic moments that had me laughing. It is entertaining to see the exciting life the rich can lead, and even more entertaining to poke fun at modern day obsessions. Yes it is different from the classic, but if you give this a chance you can enjoy this simplistic, predictable film and the positivity it radiates. Is it worth a trip to the theater? Not even close, but take a peek at it when it hits redbox in a few months. My scores are: Comedy/Drama/Family: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0",Annie
33,mike48128,"Won a ""Razzie"" for worst rip-off remake.",4,4 October 2017,"Not an all black cast! I was surprised and pleased by that. Once I got over the initial fact that there ""ain't no freckle-faced redhead"" in the lead, I tried to gave the movie a chance. I really didn't like it very much. The 11-year-old playing Urban Annie can sing but is a weak dancer! However, some of the songs are almost ""thrown away"". I just didn't like some of the lead actors. A cell-phone magnate is a far cry from an industrialist or real estate tycoon. As it was set in the present day, it lost all all of its 1930's period charm. No Punjab! I suppose that today's orphans might be called Foster Children? ""Opportunity"" is the only decent new song and several familiar ones are missing. Jamie Foxx sings surprisingly well. Cameron Diaz does Miss Hannigan as an ex-pop star and there are only 4 kids. What happened to ""You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile? It plays over the end titles. Otherwise, it stands alone as a ""different"" musical remake and it seemed like a cheaply-produced TV movie. A penthouse view is not The Warbucks Mansion. Annie's parents are still alive but never show up! Very disappointing but it was a box office success! It only played 2 months past its Christmas Debut. For another bad ""remake"" see ""Annie-A Royal Adventure"", from many years ago.",Annie
34,Screen_Blitz,"This modernized adaption is not great, but its not terrible",6,13 April 2015,"In this modernized adaption of the 1982 original, Quvenzhane Wallis (Beast of The Southern Wild) plays Annie, a ten-year old orphan who lives in a foster home with four other girls and their mean-spirited foster mother, Miss Hannigan (played by Cameron Diaz). Jamie Foxx plays Will Stacks, a business entrepreneur who sells these iPhone-like smartphones they call ""Stack Mobiles"", takes Annie under his wing where she has some of the most memorable experiences of her life. Surprisingly, I did not find his movie to be near as bad as I thought it would be. While it wasn't great, it wasn't as bad as many might think.The singing was okay in some scenes, some of the actors, however, could really use some improvement. Jamie Foxx's singing was pretty impressive. I was amazed by how well he managed bring out his voice during his scenes. My least favorite scene, however, was when Annie and the girls sang ""Its a Hard Enough Life"". The dancing in that scene didn't seem very well choreographed and some of the girls' singing was a bit off. Quvenzhane's singing was quite adorable to watch though. Another thing that disappointed me was Cameron Diaz's performance as Miss Hannigan. Those scenes where she yells and berates the girls were quite obnoxious. Diaz seemed like she was constantly struggling to squeeze her anger out and it made her acting so laughable. The rest of the actors, however, did an alright job, especially Jamie FoxxThis movie is definitely not as good as the 1982 original, but it was still somewhat enjoyable. If you are a big fan of musicals, there is a chance you might enjoy it.",Annie

36,RforFilm,The sun's not coming tomorrow or anytime for this Annie,2,27 December 2014,"It's obvious that the studios know that family films are in demand and try their best to come out with something that will not only make money, but continue to return to it, ranking it in with DVD and streaming sales. Material like The Smurfs and the recent Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have brought in the families to the theater, but seem to lack the drive to continue it's life after woods. The reason so is that they try too hard to seem more hip and cool then to tell a good story. The pressure is on to please everyone, yet why can't the studios just focus on the story rather then marketing?Our subject in point is the new Annie. The biggest point that Sony is trying to get across is that the classic story is now being transported to the modern era. I know Annie well enough as I participated in an elementary school production. The musical is very popular around children and I'm sure their gonna make their parents take them to this. Placing little orphan Annie in the current day has some possibility (not much, but some), but dangerous considering that most kids were already fine with the depression era setting. Let's see how well Annie can brighten my life.Ten year old Annie (Played by Quvenzhané Wallis) is a foster child living in Harlem with the mean alcoholic Colleen Hannigan (played by Cameron Diaz). She lives with four other girls that are constantly reminded by Miss Hannigan that no one wants them and that they will forever be without parents. Annie is the neighborhood optimist who always puts a smile on the neighbors and is always waiting outside of the Itallian restaurant that her parents left her at, promising to return. Will Stacks (played by Jamie Fox) is a cell phone mogul who is planning to run in the next New York mayor election. His public image is not good as he dislikes the company of other people. During an outing, he saves Annie from getting hit by a car. Though she runs off, someone shot the footage and it becomes viral. Will's campaign manager Guy (played by Bobby Cannavale) convinces him to meet up with Annie. Will take her out for lunch, only to be persuaded to take her in, saying that his rating will go up. The two bond while Guy and Hannigan plot to separate Annie from her new friend and possible new father. As I mentioned, bringing the classic Annie could work, but not with how this movie is doing it. That's a shame because Wallis is actually a good Annie; she's spunky, full of energy and has the cute looks to pull it off. Sadly, she's the only thing positive I can say about this. Rather them coming off as progressive, Annie seems to be interested in not only turning all the songs into top ten hits, but the polishing the script so that there can be as many social media references as possible. Speaking of the script, this has to be one of the most poorly written musicals I have seen. Emotional transitions come sporadically, the motivations make little sense and even the wants and needs of New York are materialistic. I don't think the Big Apple wants to be seen as this. The worst offense here is Cameron Diaz and Hannigan. Her acting here is legendary, spewing off attempted mean behavior and a drunk demeanor only to come off as forced and phony. I can't blame her, as the casting was not good. The sun comes not tomorrow nor anytime near this Annie.I'll give this two Sandy the dogs out of ten. Rather then giving a good reason, Annie serves a good reason why musicals should stick to their time period. Let's hope they don't remake The Music Man in modern day Detroit with hip-hop instead of a marching band.",Annie
37,natashabowiepinky,"The next Les Miserables, it ain't.",5,8 January 2015,"The best joke to be found in this remake of the 'classic' (to some, DEFINITELY not me) can be found at the beginning, when a little perky red haired girl's class report is abruptly interrupted by our true protagonist, in an obvious dig at the original. Sad to say, what unfolds never reaches those dizzy heights again.You can jazz it up with as many modern gadgets and references to technology as you want, and even rearrange the old songs to make them more palatable to modern audiences... But at heart, this is still a rather simplistic tale of a stoic wealthy man (played by Jamie Foxx) who's in the race to become mayor of New York finding there's more to life then working and money when he adopts Annie from a miserable foster home (presided over by a irritatingly hammy Cameron Diaz). Initially only agreeing to become her charge for electoral reasons (the voters LOVE candidates posing with kids, apparently), he forms a true connection with her.Although, the people watching may disagree. The bond the makers want us to see develop only arises in montages and short conversations, so rather than being moved by their budding friendship, I was left second guessing. This problem extends to most of the characters... Foxx and an attractive aide of his also fall in love without any fanfare whatsoever, and wicked Diaz decides to turn good at the drop of a hat. Perhaps if they cut out some of the more extraneous numbers and tried to give these people, ya know... Some kind of DEPTH I might have been more involved in their fates.Ah yes, the songs... The only ones I knew in advance were The Sun'll Come Out Tomorrow and It's A Hard Knock Life (Which of course, isn't a patch on the version released by one of the producers, Jay Z). The rest? Pretty bland. I found myself glancing away from the screen while they were on, wondering when the uninspiring tunes and corny lyrics were going to come to an end. I can't see this soundtrack becoming a mammoth Frozen-style success story, put it that way.The climax also must rank as a giant disappointment... You have Annie being taken away by fake parents in a car. She's possibly the most well known little girl in The Big Apple at this stage, and as she rides through the city she's photographed by all and sundry and put on social media. A helicopter is soon in hot pursuit, followed by half of the NYPD squad cars as they follow the progress of where the snapshots are taken. With such odds stacked against the erroneous mother and father, whether they'll be caught or not is a foregone conclusion. This works well if you want a happy ending, but registers the suspense level at a zero rating.To me, this is two hours that will quickly be forgotten, and a failed effort to update a much-loved (Though please leave ME out of the equation) musical to present times. Those who are fans the 1982 movie will most likely stick with that. Those who were born decades later... Will most likely not care less. Nice job, director-type person. 5/10",Annie

40,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Rock Bottom Dollar Sorrow,1,22 December 2014,"To make people forget what you're taking the place of, the most effective device is to mention that particular thing to get it or in this case to get her out of the way, quick.So begins the new ANNIE inside a classroom where a redheaded girl wraps up an annoying presentation... and then it's time for the next student, also named ANNIE, played by last year's Oscar nominated Quvenzhané Wallis, who not only trumps this movie's pseudo Annie but the original, Aileen Quinn's iconic orphan, is outdone in one aspect – compared to a haves and have nots opening number inspired by The New Deal, FDR never had such posthumous promotion. ANNIE, a MR. DEEDS style mainstream comedy with pop culture references galore, introduces each character as if they were cameos in a parody instead of a genuine remake, or in this case... altering from the 1930's into modern day... a reboot.Wallis sleepwalks through the pains and joys of the title character, and replacing Carol Burnett as the mean orphanage or rather Foster Home den mother is Cameron Diaz. Almost letting her guard down right off the bat, Miss Hannigan seems more like a cranky Aunt than a villain with a hatred for little girls Providing the orphans nothing to really fear. In fact they seem completely at home, and in control: The place ain't too shabby. Warbucks Unnamed The real heavy is Bobby Cannavale, stepping into the Tim Curry role as a nefarious climber seeking a big raise from his boss, the new Daddy Warbucks in the form of Jamie Foxx as Stacks, a cell phone magnate running for New York City Mayor and, losing in the polls, he takes in an orphan for a needed boost. During their pivotal field trip bonding experience, Foxx and Wallis have the awkward non-chemistry of two actors who just started rehearsing lines. Stacks isn't very uptight to begin with for his eventual heart-melting transition to matter, while Annie doesn't seem to really need anything, much less a new parent. Songs between the duo border banal and creepy. And as Rose Byrne attempts tying loose ends together, there's just not anything between anyone – even the dog seems bored.The original hard knocking classics aside, the new tunes lend nothing to an actual story, which isn't an entertaining rags to riches coming-of-age musical but a pointless attempt to bring a famous Comic Strip/Broadway/Cinema character back to life by throwing everything into the pot, hoping something will land.",Annie
41,MattBrady099,Damn Remakes,4,9 December 2014,"Another remake of a movie that was already alright back in the 80's and 90's, and you can already guess that this movie isn't all that good.The story is about a orphan living under the tyrannical rule of Miss Hannigan finds her life changing for the better when she has a chance run-in with the wealthy Benjamin Stacks. Annie the musical is very well known for it's leading character and it's songs that seem to be getting stuck into peoples heads. Annie as a character in the older films seem like a strong, playful and full of heart girl as she wants a happy life for herself and the other orphan girls. Annie is smart a enough to see that life can be cruel but she tries not to let that bring her or the other orphan girls down as she sings happy songs to them and herself just to keep they spirit alive, but in this version she's a perfect little goody two shoes that has many friends across the neighborhood and seems happy where she is, and the orphan girls who seem like their having fun, and at one point she get's what she wants and everyone towards the end is happy and really it's really stupid as well. I know what you all are saying, ""Put Matt it's a kids film what do you expect the next Schindler's list"", no I expect I good a movie no matter if it's a kids film or not, I'm to review movies to tell you what's good and bad, and this movie is bad, kid film or not, movies are movies, just because you say ""it's a kids film so that means it's okay"", is just utter bullshit and a cheap way of defending a film, and let's not forget that this is a movie that's open for other peoples thoughts of the film.I wasn't the biggest fan of Annie musical and the movies 80's and 90's version, I don't hate them, it's not my kind of movies but I do respect those movies as a musical and them actually trying, not like this movie. Will Gluck has proved himself of being a 50/50 directed for me and most of everyone he seen his movies. He's a okay director, but I wouldn't call him a fantastic director as well. Now he directed this movie and now his weakness has started to shown, because he didn't do the musical and the other films justices and to be honest he should have done re-shouts and re-writes to this film.Now the songs in the original was know as classic music lyrics that has been sang people most of everyone and to be honest I found the songs in original to be very catcher and I'm not going to lie but at one point I started singing one of them. The songs in the new movie are so freaking annoying and have be remade in a bad way that this move actually stabbed it self for doing that. The songs sometimes comes out of nowhere and have no purpose in some scenes, and that's sad to hear.Cameron Diaz plays Miss Hannigan and man is she missed cast for the role, she was over the top as this character and I know the character is supposed to by like that and Diaz could have pulled it off, but it didn't work at all, because as I said before the heart and story isn't there and Miss Hannigan isn't there as well. I feel really sorry for Cameron Diaz, because i know shes a good actress and can pull of great performances, but this one isn't sadly. The only good things in this movie: Quvenzhané Wallis did a good job playing Annie. Will Stacks and Annie's friendship together was very cute and done very well, it's the only thing in this movie that actually got something from the original play and movie. Overall Annie the 2014 version is a movie that in 5 years time it will be forgotten as another Hollywood remake that went no where.

43,ArchonCinemaReviews,"Fine for a one watch for kids, but not magical or special",5,30 December 2014,"The 2014 remake of the classic musical Annie is sufficient but a missed opportunity to truly reinvent the tale and become a modern day classic.Annie had a slim chance for true greatness, being a remake of a dated musical garnered toward children. It was bound to be cheesy and saccharine but Annie did not also have to be the bland and saturated cash cow product delivered to audiences.In the Jay-Z, Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith funded remake, gone is little orphan Annie of 1982 in lieu of little foster Annie, played by Quvenzhané Wallis. Daddy Warbucks is not some intimidating tycoon but Will Stacks, played by Jamie Foxx, a self-built CEO of a cell phone company. Other than these main character differences the remainder of the story stays relatively intact and is simply set in a modern environment of Manhattan.The film Annie is severely faulted in almost every aspect. Will Gluck's screenplay has all the obligatory parts to satisfy mindless viewers but lacks all the charm and awaredness of the magic that would make it great. The remake adds nothing to the tale nor takes any risks or daring to make the story its own.The opening song in Annie is a hybrid of the classic musicality of the original and quickly spins into a funner composition tweaked with the sounds of New York. It is refreshing and a novel arrangement setting in the misleading emotion of hope but immediately the film regresses into the old song and dance. Worst of the musical numbers, by far, would be Easy Street and Hard Knock Life. The travesty of Annie is the spineless way in which it shies from true modernization. With such musical talents listed as film producers of Annie it is absolutely inexcusable and simply lazy for the musical arrangements to be so uninspired. Yes, the film is set in modern times and modern New York but otherwise it is a carbon copy of the original. And yet it is worse because it is artificially molded and uninspired to appease the masses enough to get their dollar.Hollywood has an abysmal track record when it comes to translating musicals to screens and Annie is no different. Once again namey actors and autotune are cast in lieu of true performers with singing ability and it is painfully apparent. Further, the editors of the film could not be bothered to attempt to redeem the paltry lip syncing of the actors involved nor make the segues into the musical numbers be anything but abrupt.The only moments that made Annie even moderately sit-through-able would be the charm, sass and charisma between Jamie Foxx and Quvenzhané Wallis. Besides these scenes everything else is a distraction of hum-drum nonsense, making me think Gluck and company have absolutely no litmus test nor taste for what is good in this film. Unfortunately that is not enough to redeem the film because for every magical moment in Annie there are about ten that are atrocious.Check out our WEBSITE for all the reviews of the recent releases.",Annie

46,shawneofthedead,The new Annie looks great but doesn't sound or feel quite as good.,4,18 December 2014,"Purists might rant and rail, but Annie was pretty much due for an update. The hit musical was first staged on hit Broadway almost forty years ago, and was set even further back - in 1930s Depression-era America. Setting this new movie adaptation in the present day is a really smart move, as is the decision to cast a little girl who's definitely more representative these days of the poverty-stricken and forgotten souls in America. But, good intentions aside, this remake of Annie strikes more than a few false notes. The script and characters have been overhauled, largely for the worse, and the new songs mostly fall flat when they should soar.Bright, bubbly Annie Bennett (Quvenzhané Wallis) is an orphan left in the toxic care of bitter wannabe rock star Colleen Hannigan (Cameron Diaz). Every Friday, Annie visits the local Italian restaurant where her parents left her many years ago - hoping to, one day, find her family again. Instead, she stumbles quite literally into the path of wealthy politician William Stacks (Jamie Fixx), who realises that Annie's charm will greatly boost his prospects on the campaign trail. With the help of his personal assistant Grace (Rose Byrne), Stacks brings Annie to live with him. As the pair slowly become friends, he discovers that there's more to life after all than making money and closing off his heart.The smartest thing Annie did, after Will Smith's daughter Willow withdrew from the then-vanity project on account of her ""intuition"", was to cast Oscar nominee Wallis in the title role. It sends the right message - that a child living lost, forgotten and deprived on the streets isn't a ginger-haired moppet but the kind of African- American girl who really does get lost in the system these days. Wallis doesn't have the strongest set of pipes, but she's incredibly charming (if somewhat stiff) in the role - dragging most of the mediocre script in her effervescent wake. She even turns one of the new R&B-infused songs, Opportunity, into something of a show- stopper, making up for her lack of a belt with plenty of emotion and drama.But the rest of the film doesn't quite live up to her potential or charisma. Annie may be intended as an updated tale for a new generation, but instead comes off as painfully old-fashioned and clichéd. The lessons of social inequity and injustice folded into the Depression-era setting of the stage musical disappear into a heady and unironic celebration of capitalism. There's some innovation to the soundtrack - the noises and bustle of the city form the percussive backdrop for a few numbers - but none of the songs really stands out beyond Tomorrow, the blisteringly optimistic earworm of an anthem you already knew anyway.The adult cast members work hard, but don't have much to work with. Foxx has the finest singing voice of the entire cast, and he jumpstarts the otherwise boring Stacks with some of his own electric personality. But his backstory is mostly bland and predictable. Byrne is super- sweet but largely wasted as Grace. Diaz, on the other hand, appears to have wandered in from another movie altogether. She plays Miss Hannigan in so loud and outsized a fashion - a pantomime creature trapped within her own delusions - that she manages to be both fascinating and incredibly annoying to watch. The less said about Bobby Cannavale as Stacks' uber-slimy political adviser, the better.Anyone harbouring nostalgia for older versions of Annie, be they the stage musical or the TV version starring the glorious Carol Burnett as Miss Hannigan, will be disappointed by this awkward new adaptation. It tries so hard to be hip and flashy - with Annie becoming a social media sensation and her friends receiving shiny new smartphones instead of parents - but winds up losing track of the heart of its own story. There's something sadly ironic about a movie that's meant to radiate optimism and good cheer but winds up being faintly depressing instead.",Annie
47,jawneyfloros,A beautiful retelling of a classic,10,5 November 2018,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it is a superb retelling of the classic Annie.

48,Figgy66-915-598470,A joy from start to finish,10,11 January 2015,"11 January 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza this afternoon - Annie. I have been a massive fan of Annie ever since I saw Sheila Hancock play Miss Hannigan on stage in London when I was 10, so I was a little nervous of how they would modernise the story for 2015. It need not have worried, this was a joy from start to finish. The story of little orphan Annie living with the tyrannical drunk, Miss Hannigan, who is taken in by a rich benefactor has been re-written to reflect life in the 21st century complete with references to internet, tweeting and all that goes with the technology of today. The title character played wonderfully by Quvenzhané Wallis was a fresh new take on this well established role. Daddy Warbucks has been replaced by Will Stacks, a mobile phone magnate, played by Jamie Foxx, who brings humour and tenderness to an otherwise maniacal work driven role. The songs, while although recognisable as the originals have been reworked and reflect the soundtracks of today. This was a wonderful foot tapping, eye moistening, feel good version of an old favourite.....and it was produced in part by Will Smith and his wife Jada Pinkett Smith, I hope they have more in them like this.",Annie
49,kermitkid,"Why, Cameron Diaz?",7,30 March 2020,"This isn't the pop-culture travesty many people fear it to be. I enjoyed it very much. The only complaint is that Cameron Diaz can not sing. I ask you, Mr. Director, why would you cast someone in a musical if they have no singing ability? Everyone else has incredible singing chops, though. The film is surprisingly watchable and is an example of a remake done (mostly) right. They could have cut a very slow, boring song about an hour in the film, but I guess all musicals need at least one so it gives the audience a chance to get concession refills. While it has been updated to be modern-day instead of Depression-era like the original, that's not a bad thing. No kid would want to see a movie about the Great Depression anyway. I did have one problem with this movie though. Apparently they name Annie's dog Sandy because he/she (I don't know the dog's gender; its never mentioned) has a lot of energy like a hurricane. Too soon, guys. Too soon.

If the 1982 is a good 7, then the 1995 is a good 8 and the 2014 is more like a 10.I noticed some user reviews that objected to this not following the original play. I hope that to many that will seem like missing the point, and not just because of the original being a long running newspaper cartoon series.I find the music to sing. The familiarity of the old music and the new music, too. The only real flaw of the 1995, for me after seeing this, is that it included music when it would have been better without.Armchair tourism. Most stories have elements that are not too clear. North of 96th Street, yes. Try to follow the final chase with Rough Guide and Google Maps, I could not understand it too well. Two bad guys drive to a bridge in New Jersey via the Henry Hudson Parkway, then the George Washington Bridge, then south to Liberty State Park and then to the bridge. Why not the Holland Tunnel?

51,trublu215,An atrocious film filled with hollowed performances and D-grade musical numbers,3,18 December 2014,"Annie is an age old story of an orphan struggling to survive and is magically swept off her feet by a reluctant grouch who suddenly gets a warm heart and yadda yadda yadda. Yes, an updated version of Annie sounded awesome and yes, some of us had hope for it. And HELL NO is this what Annie should have become. This is perhaps one of the most ridiculous, over produced, annoyingly unoriginal remakes in recent years. With a cast like this film, starring Jamie Foxx, Quvenzhane Wallis, Cameron Diaz and Rose Byrne, this should have been a very competent film but it is so bogged down with a ridiculous hip-hop shroud of the musical numbers and poorly executed dance numbers that it is hard to take this seriously. The biggest culprit is Will Gluck, the man directs this with absolutely no flavor. It isn't hard to make the story of Annie heart warming, not in the very least. It is one of the best told stories along with being one of the best musicals of all time. Even if you were asleep at the wheel for most of the production, you could still get something out of it. Gluck fails to do pretty much everything when it comes to direction. It is lazy and unoriginal. To be frank, the only reason why I'm giving this a 3 instead of a 10 is Wallis' performance. She was truly awesome as Annie and it is a shame that the film wasn't even a fraction as good as her performance. Overall, this is a film that will more than likely have you pounding your fist against your head for the entire duration of the film...oh yeah, it is THAT bad.",Annie
52,stormhawk2021,A sacrilege to my favorite musical movie,1,17 January 2021,"You know what needed to be remade? Annie. But not just any remake. No, it needs to be a modernized, hip hop infused remake that focuses on materialism. Well, if that's exactly what you wanted, that is exactly what you got! The bad thing is, this is exactly what Annie didn't need. The modernized take on Annie follows an orphan who has a chance meeting with a billionaire mayoral candidate, but that meaning changes both of their lives. This remake falls into the category of pointless. The original from 1982 and even the Broadway musical from 1977 are more than enough, and the original can be considered a classic of sorts. Well, the film has been made, so its time to break it down.For starters, the acting is subpar. The opening scene mocks a redhead and freckled girl representing classic Annie who does a joyful tap dance to rolling eyes in front of a modern classroom. She then gets booted off stage for being ""uncool."" Enter Will Smith's replacement ""Annie"" who then takes over and of course the class loves her because she's into hip hop culture and ""cool."" The child actors are expectedly bad, most of the adults are given nothing to work with, and then there is Cameron Diaz as Ms. Hannigan. There is absolutely no excuse for how horrible she is. She's just too nice, pretty and bubbly to play a heartless woman. It was like she put up a ''bad break-up'' mood to act cruel, and it didn't work. You cannot put a friendly-faced actress to perform as Ms. Hannigan: in the original, Carol Burnett nailed perfectly into the part. This is a poorly written film that bounces around all types of tones, with pacing that moves things quickly until the musical numbers kick in, which feel very out of place and bring things to a screeching halt. Which brings us to the music... The film ""modernized"" the classic songs by changing the beats of the songs to a faster tempo hip hop beat. If it sounds pointless, its because it is. By the time the credits do roll, there isn't much that sticks in the mind except one insanely horrible performance.Nothing more to say, if you're gonna make a black Annie, you might as well fully commit and make all the originally white characters, black, just saying. ""The Wiz"" (1978) it's a good black rendition of ""The Wizard of Oz"". And don't come with nonsense like racism or anything like that.PS: If you liked the performance of Cameron Diaz as Ms. Hannigan, go watch ""The Mask"" instead.",Annie

The girl that played 14-year- old Pepper was too cynical and aloof. The acting from the other kids in foster care are cringe-worthy, and so was Jamie Foxx's, Miss Hannigan, and the woman that adopted Annie.It had good singing in it but there was too many of them.I wonder why Annie and Mr. Stacks became celebrities.The foster lady was too mean by spraying the bottle in the kids' faces. Even Annie bumps into somebody and almost gets hit by a car.This Annie was just too playful.The movie that they we're watching was too romantic.This movie was too silly and the ending was not emotional!

I loved how the songs were edited to sound more relative to this time frame. Many people are giving this movie negative reviews and are being ignorant, but this movie was wonderfully put together. Jamie Fox is a wonderful singer and so was Quvenzhané Wallis, to me she was 10 times better than Aileen Quinn. This movie had really positive vibes. I loved hearing Quvenzhané Wallis sing opportunity and the city's mine with Jamie Fox. I would re-watch this movie at least 30 times. I love how much comedy was in this movie with the fusion of emotional attachment. Quvenzhané Wallis also, was a great actress in this movie and I loved the happy ending to this movie. Cameron Diaz was also very talented and had me laughing with her conceited character and she did a great job on the ""Little Girls"" song. By far the best movie I have seen.",Annie

If you change things you are damned for changing. If you keep things the same you are damned by comparison to the 'classic' versions that have gone before. This film fails on both levels. Setting it in modern times makes you cringe with embarrassment. Acting kids always have that smiley theatre trained over confident, precocious totally unreal 'fake' sound and look, which is pretty much standard for a group of kids, particularly in a musical. In this offering they actually reach a new level of annoyance. But you can excuse the kids, because the adults are so so much worse. Cameron Diaz cannot act - it was pitiful. Do not waste your time watch this film, you will never get that 2 hours of your life back. You have been warned.",Annie

I am a big fan of the 1994 film and I like this version about as much as that! -The story itself is different from the original somewhat, but the modern update called for some changes and I liked them.-The pace was good, but there is a slow point in the film that is noticeable.-The supporting characters, everyone but Annie, are a bit cheesy. And kinda goofy, but they are not too much over-the-top. There are a few elements like the characters that did feel geared towards younger audiences.-The acting is good though. I noticed that both Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz both acted will in their over-the-top characters. I will say the true star was Annie though. I can't spell her name, but she outshined Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz in most of the scenes. Good work! -Now the music is pretty great! I liked the updated music and, although not every original song was in it, I really liked the new songs they added! -The film is also very funny! I laughed at most of the jokes made and them adding jokes poking fun at musicals was very smart.-It is rated PG for some mild language. Nowhere near as bad as like Rango.-So Annie has a few elements that feel younger or cheesy, but I thought it was very fun, entertaining, and I loved the music! I honestly would give it a good 7.5 and say that Annie is totally worth seeing in theaters!",Annie

They had this kid spouting out so many smart-mouth things that it was hard to even like her. Jamie Foxx was okay in this, but he usually is. Even he, however, didn't have the strength to carry this turkey very far. Face it, there are some pictures that simply do not need to be remade. Annie being one.

58,japamo,"21st Century, Digital Media Update of the Quintessential ""Rags to Riches"" Tale is a High-Spirited Delight",8,31 December 2014,"have a terrible confession straight out of ""Ripley's Believe It Or Not"". Before seeing 2014's ""Annie"" (hereafter ""Annie 2014""), I had never seen any ""Annie"" movie or play, including the current 2014 musical. Of course I was familiar with the basic characters and the comic strip, ""Little Orphan Annie"" which inspired all these productions. Who isn't? I mention this to warn any readers that I can't compare ""Annie 2014"" to any previous incarnations. I leave that to other posters more knowledgeable about ""Annie"" lore.OK, blah, blah, blah, on to the movie. As my title suggests, ""Annie 2014"" is set in modern- day, digital technology crazy New York. Quvenzhané Wallis is now Annie, a bright, spunky, creative young lady and foster child (NOT ""orphan"", thank you). She lives in a two-story foster home ""run"" by the ill-tempered shrew Miss Colleen Hannigan (Cameron Diaz). When not attending school, each day Annie, doggedly seeking her true birth parents, hangs around a local Italian restaurants based on the slight suggestion that her parents often patronize the establishment. They never show, and each time the restaurant owner consoles Annie with a cannoli.On the other end of the class spectrum, digital phone tycoon William""Will"" Stacks (Jamie Foxx, playing the Daddy Warbucks character) is running a faltering campaign for New York mayor. It's no wonder because Will is a surprisingly introverted germophobe living a lonely bachelor life in his vast, high-tech penthouse. The only people with whom he has any personal relationship are Grace Farrell (Rose Byrne), a solicitous, efficient personal assistant harboring a secret yearning for Will, and Guy (Bobby Cannavale), a PR dynamo frantically working ANY angle to boost Will's poll numbers. When, by sheer chance, Will saves Annie from being run over, Guy sees this as an opportunity to show New York that if Will is willing to be a stepparent to penniless waif Annie -at least until she finds her true parents- then Will does truly care about all New Yorkers and will represent them well as mayor. Of course, Will strenuously opposes the idea of a kid complicating his orderly life, but of course he's no match for the winsome Annie, who erodes all of Will's defenses.The PR stunt works - for a while. Will's poll numbers surge, and Annie becomes the sweetheart of New York. Still, despite her ""rags to riches"" ascent, Annie cannot give up her dream of finding her birth parents. Besides, the rich man/poor girl political attraction is beginning to wear thin. So conniving Guy arranges to have those ""birth"" parents appear, authenticated down to their DNA. Will, for so long being a socially clumsy misanthrope, has come to care for and love Annie like a daughter and is unwilling to give her up. But something fishy is going on now, and Will and company will have to employ all the technological gadgets at his command to get Annie back.""Annie 2014"" is a well-paced visual and auditory delight. New York appears as a vibrant, ultra-modern, and inviting metropolis, especially when Will takes Annie on a helicopter tour of the city. The musical numbers are integrated naturally into and advance the plot instead of hindering it (The well-known ""Hard-Knock Life"" number, when Annie and her foster home sisters, at Miss Hannigan's ferocious bidding, turn into cleaning machines to tidy up the building in time for a health inspection, is a stunning example). Wallis's Annie is an uplifting character who is resourceful, feisty, and determined to overcome adversity (and a secret handicap) without being an insufferable brat. ""Annie 2014"" even has time for Grace's, Guy's, and Miss Hannigan's story arcs, where either they get rewarded for true loyalty, punished for unscrupulous loyalty, or get the chance for a good relationship once they soften up and repent. Foxx plays the billionaire as an aloof person not as someone you can't stand, but as a sad, isolated figure who you hope will cut back on the workaholic ways he followed since he was a kid and let the people who care for him in. Not least, ""Annie 2014"" celebrates the power, wonder, and utility of smartphones, Facebook, Instagram, and laptop computers as a way to bring people closer together. And yes, the pooch playing Sandy is sweet and photogenic, even when Will is feeding him Annie's awful-tasting meals.In short, Annie is a high-spirited delight calculated to sweeten any disposition.",Annie

Whoever held the copyright should be suing the pants off these people.The 1977 Broadway musical and its many revivals have thrilled millions - this horrible movie will not.Annie has been done at least a couple times on film but this urbanized remake is one try too many.

Many of the songs are badly lip-synched, so it easy to see that the actors are not really singing on set. The acting, while okay, is for the most part, not top notch, but the script-writing is pretty good. Miss Hannigan and Will Stacks (the Daddy Warbucks character) are both slightly more rounded people than in the earlier movie incarnations. The person who really carries this movie is Quvenzhane Wallis. Wallis, who plays Annie, is charming and enchanting.Watch this alongside of the other movie versions and see what you think.",Annie
62,Brevin_Campbell,Sooo..what is wrong with black Annie?,7,28 December 2014,"When I first read the reviews of Annie I was a little bit skeptical to watch the film. I thought it would be a boring rip off of the original Annie. So I was greatly surprised when I got to see the ending of the film at my job, and found it to be quite lovely. I couldn't help but want to go and watch it and see what made people hate on it at all. The film does start of pretty weak I will admit, and being a fan of the original Annie I did feel a little disrespected when they made fun of the original that being said I got over it quickly as the rest of the film proved itself. There was also a issue with all the random singing in the streets with Jay Z's mix on it. The whole scene just didn't feel as innocent as it should have been. Luckily I was able to get over it really quickly as the story really got started and we get introduced to Hannigan, a mean old Cameron Diaz who was trying to get a sexy man to be hers, who acts as campy as her original counterpart which made me wonder if the whole film was going to be a spoof (Which it still kinda was), but I did like her grumpy character, however that made me a bit disappointed when she turned to Annie's side, but I knew that would happen. I also would like to say it was a mistake to put Jamie Foxx as Will Stacks in this film, and I thought they should have added some twists on his character as well. I felt him next to little Annie made him far to prominent than he should of been. I get it you gotta make sure white people go see the film, but really who gives a care especially since this film is getting so much hate anyway. I would have loved it if this film had some Broadway actors in it!! Then I would like to hear any white try and call this movie bad then. It was a amazingly fun film!I thought the music in this film overall was very good. I mean seriously all the songs they were great. yes it had a duds such as ""Tomorrow"" and ""Little girls, and even ""Opportunity,"" but the others were amazing. I also loved when they did the hard knock life song. It made me very nostalgic to go and watch the original Annie again. I find myself listening to the song ""City is yours"" and ""Moonquake"" again and again. They were just soooo good. I also feel that Quvenzhané Wallis has a real future as a black actress. She is really amazing. With this and 12 years a slave she proves she can play a good range of roles in films. I hope to see her in more films in the future as she moves on with her career. I can't wait to see who she plays next in the future as she moves on with her work in the film industry. She is amazing in my opinion. Soo everyone hating on the film shouldn't be and are more than likely being racist or is mad at the scene making fun of the original Annie to much to see how this film stands in comparison to the original. The original Annie will always have a place in my heart, but this Annie was also loads of fun too!!",Annie
63,byson5186,Cute/Cheesy,6,17 March 2015,"I ought to start out by saying, that out of all the movies that came out last year/2014 this was the movie I saw most advertised. I mean for several months when I went to the movie theaters, they would always be showing this movie trailer. They even advertised this movie during Thanksgiving, having parts in the parade looking like this new movie coming out. I'm sure a lot of you noticed how advertised this movie was for months before it came out.The movie finally came out before Christmas. When the movie came out, I saw so many reviews. There were lots of reviews from the critics, most of the critics reviews were negative. I noticed all these IMDb reviews, numerous negative ones about a modern adaptation of Annie. There are also numerous positive reviews of the film, some of you who really loved it. I wondered if I should see it. Also, in terms of Box Office. Despite being well advertised this movie made a lot of money in the box office, but it did not make $100 Million or over that, but it came close at $85 Million. So, it was a widely advertised movie but not like it was one of the Top 10 movies that came out last year in terms of revenues. We can wonder how much more money it would have made if there weren't those numerous hacks online for revenge?So, I was wondering if I wanted to see this movie? One of my older sisters basically begs me to see this. She told me she saw it and loved it, and said something like she'd watch one of my favorite movies which also came out last year which I feel is way under rated called Earth To Echo. So, I didn't see this movie in the movie theaters but I just watched it after renting it from RedBox. I wanted to share my review from what I personally thought about this movie after watching it.For one, we basically all know the story of Annie. Annie is a very common play/musical. I can remember way back in 7th Grade when my friend participated in the play Annie. He even had a big role as Daddy Warbucks and shaved his hair to go bald for that role. It was a very entertaining and happy play. While seeing this film, I thought that it didn't look like we were watching a modern version of Annie, but it looked more like a cute girls movie and more of it's own story than following the original Annie story.I thought while watching, that this movie seems mostly like a movie for little girls. I can imagine there being numerous girls Elementary School Aged who are obsessed with this movie and dancing like Annie. I'd think most boys the same age would think of this movie as too girly, remembering how boys act that age. Like this probably isn't a movie boys would put on during a sleepover, but girls would.Here are some of my other thoughts. I'm sure a lot of you can agree with me on this, but I felt like a lot of the movie focused on the music, dancing, and magic and focused less on the plot. It didn't seem to focus too much on the plot until like the last 3/4 of the movie which at that point the movie started to get good. But, a lot of the movie seems like you're watching a long music video or just entertaining moments where all those scenes could be put on YouTube individually. You see scene after scene where it's another song and interesting choreography with the characters.I also felt like the characters in this movie were so unrealistic. I mean they acted mostly unrealistic that their performances were laughable, especially Miss Hannigan played by Cameron Diaz. She was just flat out annoying and so unrealistic that her performance was totally laughable. Not like the actors in the movie were bad actors, but just possibly not the right ones for the role or the writers made their characters as so unbelievably unrealistic, but they probably did this to make the movie more cute and it also makes the movie funny.Besides all this, the movie was somewhat good. I mean, the movie was cute. We might like watching the songs on YouTube. It seemed to have good messages that were shown more in the music than actual plot. But, most of all despite seeing how this movie could have been better it still is a movie that is somewhat entertaining and just makes you feel really happy inside watching. It has a happy mood. I'd almost give it a higher rating than a 6, especially during the last 3/4 of the movie where it started to get pretty good. But, there still are a lot of things wrong with this movie even though it was well thought out of in terms of performance, so I'll end it with a 6. But, the most positive thing about this movie is how happy it will make you feel inside.",Annie
64,valen060,"Contrived and Predictable, Yet Still Has Heart",7,17 January 2015,"It took me quite a while to figure out how to write a review over this new Annie since its December release, but upon witnessing it that same month, I was expecting it to provide more than just a new setting, contemporary look, and a set of familiar celebrities portraying characters that I've already seen done well by others in the past film versions. I knew from the very first opening scene that there was bound to be a few nods to the past incarnations of Annie and that classroom scene featuring a ""red-head"" Annie gave a nice tribute to the original. Now, in spite of the catchy musical numbers that were done splendidly well by Jamie Foxx, Rose Byrne, Quvenzhane Wallis, and her fellow on screen foster sisters, the film as a whole was a teeter-totter between ""embarrassing"" and ""amused"" throughout. Why? Because if you've seen John Huston's 1982 original or Rob Marshall's 1999 remake, at least they both had likable characters that were anything but an embarrassment. It wasn't like they threw in blatant product endorsements (fictional or real) just to make it better than its original stage production.Cameron Diaz's termagant Miss Hannigan felt near-similar to the Bad Teacher persona she once portrayed back in that 2011 comedy (albeit toned down for family audiences) and her singing debut was subpar, but it was too obvious that it's her first time since she's never sung on film before, can't blame her. Not to mention her character seems to acknowledge aloud that people spontaneously burst into song for no apparent reason, which I found laughable and seems to make this film look more like a spoof semi-musical rather than a full-fledged one.With producer Will Smith aided by music producer Jay-Z, it was pretty clear that the classic musical numbers sung in the original were in need of a 21st century revamp since most would already know some songs were themed to the 1930s Depression Era. To me, I had a mix feeling of wanting to listen to them again and other times skip ahead on the playlist. However, the song titled ""Opportunity"" was the real show-stealing number that I found quite interesting among all the recognizable song titles. Quvenzhane Wallis really stood out well as she performed it onstage and I applaud her for it.I know some audiences have criticized over a ""black"" Annie, but everyone felt the same way with Overbrook Studios' 2010 remake of 80s classic, 'The Karate Kid' (featuring Will Smith's son Jaden as the lead). To me, it doesn't matter who they are or what they look like, all that mattered to me was how they delivered splendid performances. The true chemistry that actually won me over was that between Wallis and Foxx and kept me intrigued. Various celebrity cameos certainly kept me amused as well as a few in- joke references to 'Twilight' and especially SNL's Bobby Moynihan, but overall, I can say that the film's heart was in the right place, but it could've improved on more than just multiple blatant product endorsements or cliché moments since they have a tendency to hinder the film's main storyline.",Annie
65,moviescoundrel,"A Nice Attempt, but Could Have Been Better",7,2 January 2015,"I was expecting a bit better of a remake here. While I don't think it is quite in line with how bad critics are saying it is, it's not amazing. The songs are similar to the original's, albeit a bit ""fresher"" here with a hip hop tone. The story is similar to the original, except for Stacks (Foxx) is not just a business man, he is a political candidate and the CEO of a popular cellular company, similar to Verizon. There is some product placement, and some focus on extrinsic motivations and ""things"", but I didn't feel it was the main focus of the film or detracted from the story too much. I thought the reincarnations of the music were pleasant for the most part, although there were moments where characters burst into song that didn't feel quite right and Cameron Diaz singing wasless than amazing. The sets and scale of the musical pieces were also not as well orchestrated or as grand as the original. One would think that while redoing ""Annie"", you would have to come big, as well as different, and the big and grand is just not here. The soundtrack is very good, but the movie just feels hollow and not well thought out.

For me, however, this was just yet another missed opportunity. I've been fond of Annie, the Broadway musical, from the beginning. When the 1982 movie version came out, I found it a disappointment; the casting did not deliver, the story was clumsily handled, and some of the songs were changed but not for the better. This second big-screen effort was a major disappointment for me too. The only bright spot was that Quvenzhane Wallis was a slightly better fit for the title role than Aileen Quinn in 1982, despite her not having red curls and freckles. Her Annie, a foster child rather than an orphan, is more adorable than cute. The rest of the movie was an attempt to update the story at the expense of many of the musical's original songs, some of which may grow on you after a while. I do think two of the new songs should have been nominated for Oscars, namely The City's Yours and Who Am I? I actually prefer The City's Yours to the original's NYC which it replaced. However, the new storyline also took on a bit more than it could chew, and was not more engaging. The rest of the cast were okay, although some players came off as too earnest. The saddest thought is that this may mean the last attempt to make an Annie for the big screen, which will really be a big shame.",Annie

To paraphrase a quote from Will & Grace, ""Mariah-Carey-in-Glitter"" bad.This movie is just so awful there is literally nothing good about it. Jamie Foxx's Will Stacks is so unlikeable you find yourself wishing he did get hit and killed by the truck at the beginning. Rose Byrne is grossly underutilised and given horribly vapid dialogue that even she can't make work. Cameron Diaz's performance as an abusive, drunk foster mum began ok and then she opened her mouth to sing and my ears started to bleed. As for newcomer Quvenzhane Wallis (P.S. Your parents should be shot for giving you that first name) seems to have been picked only because she's African American with a fro and a gap between her two front teeth. There really is no acting, singing or dancing talent here. The dialogue is pedestrian and for some reason everyone is speaking at 3x the normal speech rate so it's ridiculously hard to keep up with what's happening. And this is probably the biggest problem with this movie. It's moving so fast there's no time for character development or an emotions whatsoever. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.",Annie
69,russellingreviews,It is a hard knock movie,2,10 January 2015,"It is a hard knock moviePopcorn, M&Ms and large drink... roll the film A classic story from theatre, film and the comics. The cute red-headed orphan with the red dress. We have seen the films of Annie, but this one has some obvious changes. Will the story and music work in this modern version? Kid's Korner rating: 1.5 stars Parent's Rating: 1 starAnnie is the re-telling of the classic musical about an orphan who is given the opportunity to experience the world of one of the wealthiest men in the city. Quvenzhané Wallis (Beasts of the Southern Wild) plays Annie, a street-smart, foster kid in New York City. As a baby, she was left by her parents with the promise that they'd be back for her someday. The years pass by and her parents do not come to get Annie. She is moved from one foster care facility to another and is currently under the care of Miss Hannigan (Cameron Diaz). Through the inevitable twists and turns of the busy streets of New York City, she runs into the hard-nosed tycoon and New York mayoral candidate Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx). Based on the advice of his company vice president, Grace (Rose Byrne) and his less-than-wise campaign manager, Guy (Bobby Cannavale), Stacks takes on the fostering responsibilities of Annie for the sake of growing public opinion. Their relationship grows beyond a political move to a deeper familial connection. From the beginning of Will Gluck's retelling of the classic orphan tale, he seems to have an underlying disdain for the original story. It should be explained that this is not a modern spin on a classic story, but a politically correct re-telling of Annie. Gluck manages to eliminate the heart of what made the original story endearing. Usually the music can make up for poor acting, but the modern spin on the familiar tunes did not translate well. Even with the quality of actors, the acting felt robotic and the chemistry between the characters felt manufactured and unbelievable. To go through all of the challenges of this film would take too long. The Kid's Korner recommendation is to go see Paddington or rent the original Annie instead. Dad asked the question on the ride home, 'What did we think of the film?' We really tried to find something good about the film, but there was not much we liked about the film. The girls love a good musical, but this was not a good musical. The original has 'cheesy' by today's standards, but it was much better than this film. Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What does the Bible say about orphans? (John 14:18, James 1:27) 2. Why is family important?

70,GoUSN,"A fun romp, with all the right touches",6,19 January 2015,"As I read critiques of this film, I notice something. The critics appear humorless and without a sense of whimsy or fun. This is based ultimately on a comic strip that was turned into a stage musical. Where, exactly, is the criticism coming from that says these characters are underdeveloped? For a comic strip turned stage musical, then updated to 2014, this is a perfectly designed romp (with one major exception I'll get to). It was funny, the characters perfect captures of their respective types (comic strip, folks; comic strip), and the overall experience one of fun. OK, yes, we could have called in a Dostoyevsky clone and made this an indecipherable mood piece, but why on earth would we do that? The one odd note. The choreography. Not only was it leaden and uninspired, there were obvious instances when characters were exiting their dance segment only to be caught by the camera as (1) they were exiting (smiles gone), while (2) others in view were still dancing. We took children, sports-loving boys aged 10, and they loved it. Perhaps the ultimate test of a musical.",Annie

I am a BIG fan of the original stage play and thought the last movie version was decent, with some memorable moments and performances. I realize this is an update to modern times, but it tries too hard on too many levels to be too many things to too many people.The chemistry between Stacks and Annie is good, but not great. Miss Hannigan, originally is a mean, funny drunk (cue carol Burnett). Diaz's character is just mean.The new songs fall flat (for me) and I didn't care for the updated version of ""Easy Street."" The only good musical number is ""A Hard Knock Life,"" staying true to the original song and choreography. But most of the numbers just come out of nowhere. The dancing is mediocre, and none of the numbers seem to ""pop."" The updated story line is preposterous, and I'm not sure children will understand the political angle. SPOILER ALERT--Then there's the literacy thing. Again, just trying too hard.The kids may like it, but young ones will be confused and there's not much to grab their attention. Adults may find it tedious.One shining character/addition is the social worker. Masterfully underplayed, she steals the show.",Annie
72,Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd,Annie Review,4,19 December 2014,"My Thoughts:The latest in the lineups of Hollywood remakes comes Annie. Of course, it is updated for the 21st century. I tried to give this movie a chance to stand on its own. It has been ages since I have seen the 1982 version and didn't watch it so I could give this movie a shot on its own. It didn't help.The first thing I noticed is that Cameron Diaz is not made to be the evil foster parent (at least, not for this movie). As soon as she came on screen and was trying to act all mean and abusive, I was thinking Cameron, you are trying to hard and it is showing. I don't know who made the decision that she would be great in this role, but sadly, it falls flat. That goes for a lot of the actors in this movie as well. Even with a run time of two hours, there is very little character development; everyone plays their roles to the letter, but nothing really yanks on our heartstrings.The updated songs are okay, but they just did not seem to resonate with me like the 1982 version seemed to. And some of them were like really? You couldn't think of anything better?Quvenzhané Wallis is adorable as the little, street-smart Annie, and through no fault of her own, there is not a lot of build-up to make us feel for her. Everything seems written so fast and trying to get to the end but lacking the build up of emotions. All we get is here is Annie, here is her waiting for her parents, here is her bumping into Mr. Stacks, etc. etc. Sadly, this movie does not offer anything insightful as a remake. I am all for a remake if they put their own spin on it and try to make it their own. All this remake did was update it for the present and after that, seemed to copy and paste very badly. My Recommendation:Rent it.",Annie

74,CharlieGreenCG,It's a hard knock life ...,6,18 December 2014,"Straight after the opening credits, a young, ginger-haired, pale girl called Annie is giving a presentation in class. She is congratulated and returns to her seat, up comes another young girl also called Annie (played by Quvenshane Wallis). However this time she is visually different with puffy brown hair and ethnic background. Thus, the baton is almost passed on from the predeceasing versions of Annie in this wink allowing it to do whatever it likes. And it does.Annie is probably one of the best known musicals in history since its Broadway genesis in 1977. Since then, it has had television versions, books and two quite successful film adaptations, now this – a further remake of the musical classic. But why was it is remade yet again considering its status? Producers of the recent incarnation, Will Smith and Jay-Z, took to its defence stating that it is 'a modern re-imagination of a beloved musical' – which is reasonably fair.If there had not been any versions of Annie beforehand, and this was its first appearance, then it would be a musical phenomenon in the likes of Frozen's success. Sadly, it is not, and will through generations of viewings always be comparable and given prejudice – which is never a good thing in the film industry – hence the awful receptions it has received so far as well as the many one-star reviews.Similar to the original story, the central character Annie, has a fairly hard knock life (no pun intended). Nothing seems to have gone her way since she was abandoned at aged-four outside a restaurant. Since then, she has been in numerous fosters homes throughout New York – but currently in the care of Colleen Hannigan (Cameron Diaz), who treats her unfairly and instead of kisses, gets kicked (still no pun intended).Updated to the modern era, a phone business tycoon, William Stacks (Jamie Foxx), is running for Mayor of NYC and coincidentally meets Annie, and decided he should help her out. It all seems simple enough until you add the fact it is still a musical, and at every street corner, scenario and character development there is a catchy song around the corner lingering and ready to pounce. Of which, the star-studded cast all sing aloud (reasonably well, apart from the over-the-top Diaz – cringe).Indefinite to always live in the shadow of its former versions, Annie could still prove to be a fairly popular family-film over Christmas. But overall, it is mediocre at the very best.",Annie

I am usually with the remote control , ready to change the scene when watching films with the kids. That was not necessary with this film.The scripts, acting, directing and producing of the film was good. Too bad some people decide to give it a low rating.

76,agblum,Not a Total Mess - Music is Mostly Good and Some Good Humor,7,21 December 2014,"""Annie"" is a modern day retelling of the acclaimed Broadway Musical and 1982 musical film based on the show, which was based on the 1924 Comic Strip ""Little Orphan Annie"" which in the original show and movie, takes part during the Great Depression, telling the story of Orphan Annie - a pre-teenage hoping for a return of her parents, who disappeared after they left her on the steps of of an orphanage as a baby. In this version, which again takes place in the modern day, it is revealed in the early part of the film that Annie, played by Quvenzhané Wallis (Academy Award Nominee for the ""Beasts of Southern Wild"") was left as a baby at a restaurant by her parents, and is now a foster kid, under the care of Miss Hannigan, played by Cameron Diaz. The Billionaire character ""Daddy Warbucks"" of the classic story, has been replaced by the character of ""Will Stacks"", played by Jamie Foxx (Academy Award winner for ""Ray""), who is also a Billionaire from his cell phone business, and is running for Mayor of New York City. So – leading up to this film, the predicted expectations were of gloom and doom, presumably I think because this version does not take place in the original time line, and because some people's now negative views (not mine) towards Actor/Rapper Will Smith, who co-produced the film with among others, his wife, Actress Jada Pinkett Smith, and Rapper and Business Mogel Shawn ""Jay-Z"" Carter, whose sampled one of the Musical's more populars songs ""It's a Hard Knocked Life"" in his hit song ""Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)"". So what did I think – While I admit – the movie does became a mess to a great deal, it is not a total mess, and could have been a lot worse. A lot of songs that many of us love are there and performed well by the cast, some with variations, some of which are understandably, and some which may have probably weren't necessary. There are some new songs as well, including the very touching ""Who am I?"" - sung by Diaz, Foxx and Wallis's characters in the later part of the film. Some of the modern day jokes, just some of the humor in general works well, and some falls flat. Kids should like this version of ""Annie"" just fine. Adults - I think most who are fans of the original are going to be annoyed by it. I myself am I fan of the Broadway show and 1982 Movie. While I obviously didn't love this version myself, again, While it does become a mess to a great deal,it's not a complete one. My rating is for the music, and some of the humor – 2 ½ out of 4 Stars (The ½ star is for the previously mentioned new song ""Who am I?"").",Annie

78,wall17,Perfectly Decent Update Which the Kids Liked,7,2 January 2015,"Annie is a good little update of the classic rags-to-riches story, transposed to modern New York City. They kept enough of the classic songs from the musical/original movie and added a few nice ones for the modern ear, all fairly seamlessly. There are a number of sly jokes (almost easter eggs) about the original production and homages to the comic strip sprinkled throughout, if you're sharp enough to spot them.Yes, the story is predictable, but you already know the story, right? The journey to get there is sweet, without fart jokes or explosions or fight scenes (except for one woman-on-cartoon-villain punch), and features an excellent performance from Quvenzhané Wallis. Cameron Diaz pulls a turn (what a trouper) as the mean foster mom.(I regret Hollywood persists in depicting foster parents and social workers as venal and disinterested in children, though, which is the exact opposite of what these heroes are like. Seriously, somebody please do write a good movie about foster care and adoption some time that shows the realities. But I digress, it's a musical, the book for this basic plot was already written by Dickens.) Jamie Foxx does a good job and gets to show off his voice a few times; I am a little sorry they didn't do more with excellent source material here, though. The script and cast subtly handle the suspension-of-disbelief issues for a movie musical, too.I do not get the following criticisms I've read elsewhere: ""overly materialistic"" - c'mon, a movie about a poor orphan (or abandoned child) and a billionaire isn't going to revel in a change from hard knocks to opulence? It's America. And it's also wrong: the virtues of hard work and the importance of family are far more emphasized in the end than the importance of being rich.""didn't address the racial/income disparity in America"" - see above. It's a pleasant family movie that does, gently, touch upon these things in a way that doesn't smack your face with it as if it were supposed to be a documentary or something.""badly staged"" - this was no ""Chicago"" in terms of kinetic movement, nor was it ""Les Miserables"" in terms of courageous real-time performance, but the filmmakers chose to use scenery of New York to show more about the story than gyrations or over the top staging. Musicals, after all, show the inner monologue we might experience via song, and the dancing/etc. are meant to augment that. This isn't groundbreaking but it is fine light entertainment for a broad audience.All in all, a perfectly decent family movie that doesn't deserve the poor reviews or ratings. My kids (7 and 10) thoroughly enjoyed it.You do have to ask yourself exactly why an innocuous movie like this has gotten slammed: the black billionaire, the interracial romance (which has exactly one kiss in it), and, you know, African-American Annie have *nothing* to do with this, I'm totally sure. Because racism is totally not a thing in 2014 America, right?",Annie
79,clg238,Go and Enjoy!,8,28 December 2014,"I thought this was a clever re-write/updating of the original, which I saw on Broadway. Jamie Foxx is his usual wonderful self and has a terrific voice (I would have liked to hear more of it). It helps if you like the music of the original, which I do very much. I also liked the additional music that Will Gluck added. Being a New Yorker at heart, I liked every glimpse of what might have been New York. There are a few things I didn't like, especially Cameron Diaz who was over- over-the-top as Miss Hannigan to the point where I found it painful to watch her. Wallis is an adorable little girl but her strong suit is neither lip syncing nor dancing; that she shines anyhow is a testament to her loveliness. Because I've been deeply involved in politics, I found the premise believable in its fantastic incarnation. ANNIE is what it is: a charming movie for the light-hearted, with tuneful songs and a lively pace.

I thought the songs were fun and catchy (including the new ones). The chemistry between Quvenzhane Wallis and Jamie Foxx gave the movie an emotional weight and yes, I did cry towards the end.

Gone are the mansion, maids, down-trodden streets of New York, the dark lighting, the all-white cast in it's place, we know what Will Stacks (the modernised version of Daddy Warbucks) does for a living, a girl who can look after herself and is looking for her identity (maybe that was also in the original, but I can't exactly remember), and a multi-racial cast. Halleluiah!I remember an episode of Boston Legal where a girl was auditioning for a stage production of Annie, but the producers denied her because she wasn't the typical, stereotype, racial white. Who cares?! This movie proves that Annie can be whatever nationality she wants to be, and it's great!What made the original movie great was Carol Burnette's Hannigan, who was a nasty piece of work who only cared about herself and really put those poor girls to work – I really felt sorry for those poor foster children! While Cameron Diaz doesn't have quite the same punch as Burnette, she pulled this role off in her own right, over the top as it was.The music was great, and I didn't notice, until I read some reviews that some of it was original pieces, which was great and spruced up the movie a lot more!Would I see it again?

I'm not sure if it's a racial thing or not (that would be disheartening), but as a white person, I enjoyed seeing a fresh take on the classic. It's nice to see a male POC being a successful businessman. And the new and updated songs by Sia are so catchy and singable. I found this movie to be touching and relevant, not to mention delightful. Yes, am I a little annoyed by the ""closure"" to the search for Annie's birth parents (oh, well, shrug our shoulders because we just can't find them anywhere), but it doesn't detract from my enjoyment.

A movie that makes me laugh and sing-along with the characters deserves a 10. Because the experience of going to the theater should be a positive one. This new ANNIE is a refreshing opportunity to enjoy and feel good. You will connect emotionally with the characters (Annie, Mr.Stacks, Miss Hannigan, Grace, and Lou) and care about their journey. This is a film that celebrates the wonders of childhood: it reminds us of how precious our little girls are. ""Annie 2014"" will make you laugh, smile, and it will warm your heart. There are some wonderful and touching moments—-those are the moments you look forward to if you watch this film a second or third or fourth time! Q. Wallis' performance is energetic and genuine. Her singing is stellar. No wonder why Annie has two Golden Globe nominations (best actress in musical and best original song). The way Wallis sings ""Opportunity"" is breathtaking! Wow!Our contemporary Annie is authentic and smart. She navigates the streets of New York with the hope that one day the sun will shine upon her and she will find her parents. I love her assertiveness –""I am a foster child, not an orphan."" In many ways, Annie is a role model... we should all learn from her! About the other characters: R. Byrne is a lonely sweet and intelligent assistant who finds a friend in Annie. C. Diaz portrays a hopeless/bitter failed-singer who now takes care of the foster little girls. J. Foxx plays a funny, lonely and ambitious Mayor-of-New York candidate. He too sings with passion and heart. I love how Lou, the Latin guy, adds a spicy, funny and sweet twist.Any flaws with this movie? Yes. Some songs are bad and some scenes are terribly silly. But those flaws do not eclipse the great message, the great music, and the great acting. The more I watch it, the more I love Annie and her quest.

91,sara2520,Quvenzhane Wallis is a star!,6,20 December 2014,"Quvenzhane Wallis is a star! She is a talented young actress that carried this movie effortlessly! Some of her scenes actually made me want to cry because I felt so sorry for Annie. I took my niece and nephew to see Annie today and we all enjoyed it! The movie was well-cast. Bobby Cannavale was hilarious as Guy and I loved him in every scene he was in.Boy! That man can sing and dance! Everyone did a wonderful job. Now, here is the problem with 2014 Annie compared to original Annie. All the comments about race and changing Annie from white to black are complete baloney and prejudice. Annie is not a historical figure. She is a fictional character that any orphan of any race can relate too. Annie's story can be any little orphan girl whether it is a black little girl from Harlem or an Asian little girl from China. It is the magic of Annie that makes the story so special. And unfortunately, 2014 Annie did not have that magic as the original. There were great touching moments like the ones that led Annie to start singing ""Tomorrow"" or when Stacks, Ms. Hannigan, and Annie sing ""Who am I?"" which was one of my favorite scenes. There was also a heartbreaking scene when Annie thought Stacks did not want her anymore and some other scenes too. Yet, a good chunk of the movie fell flat and I don't know whether it was the editing, the director, or transitioning. Yet, when it was good, it was good. The movie is not as horrible as people are panning it out to be. They are either comparing it to the original or despised the fact that Annie is black in this movie. But the only audience whose opinion truly matters is the kids of the 21st century. We had our Annie. This is their Annie and they enjoyed the movie. I truly enjoyed watching the new Annie. It is not a perfect movie, but the ending was pretty awesome. It lacks the magic of the original but the cast is great.

But when my curiosity got the best of me, I decided to give it a chance. Although I wasn't totally impressed, I do believe the film had its fair share of cute moments. You should know that this is nothing like the 1982 original. So if you're expecting the characters to be anything like Aileen Quinn, Albert Finney or Carol Burnett you will be extremely disappointed.Our new Annie is played by Hollywood newcomer Quvenzhane Wallis. As the lead, she is an admirable young girl with a perky attitude who helps those around her see the bright side of life. Annie lives in a Harlem apartment with her mean, snotty foster mother and four foster sisters. Hoping to reunite with her parents, she goes to an Italian restaurant called Domani where her parents abandoned her leaving behind a note. While rescuing a stray dog, Annie's life gradually changes for the better when Will Stacks a billionaire and mayoral candidate agrees to take her in to help further his chances of getting elected. Although not right away, Will eventually warms up to Annie and the two develop a strong bond.Quvenzhane Wallis is absolutely adorable as the lead. The movie is definitely worth watching for her performance alone. The four girls were cute at times but they don't have much to work with as far as screen time and dialogue. Cameron Diaz was far from believable as Miss Hannigan. She's no Carol Burnett but this is by far one of her worst performances ever. Jamie Foxx was goof and quite comical as the cocky, future mayor and cell phone mogul. Many of the scenes he shared with Wallis later on in the film are heartwarming and fun to watch. However, there are certain plot points that the film could've done without. The dancing scene between Bobby Cannavale and Cameron Diaz was just plain dumb. The singing was bad and it had nothing to do with the theme of the movie and therefore seemed pointless. The ""auditioning parents"" scene was just as bad. Auditioning random strangers to pretend to be Annie's parents was a horrible idea. Perhaps Mr. Gluck could've brought out the worst in Miss Diaz's character through better directing and dialogue. Not to mention the whole ""I used to be a bright star""/member of C&C Music factory was a complete joke. I mean talk about unbelievable!!!!! Jamie Foxx, Rose Byrne,Bobby Cannavale, Cameron Diaz and David Zayas are all good actors. But they don't have much to work with to really shine. Aside from a few catchy tunes, cute kids and an impressionable lead actress, ""Annie is good, but not great.",Annie

from the start i felt it was good
It's a family movie, I definitely recommend it",Annie
94,emwolf,Why?,2,12 August 2021,"I guess I understand why, this was a money grab under the guise of ""inclusivity."" The story doesn't take too many liberties, the cast is willing and eager. But what happened to the music? I saw Annie in 1978 with the lovely Andrea McArdle and was blown away. John Huston's movie was a misstep in trying to ""open up"" a stage play. The Disney TV-Movie was charming. This was beyond a mis-step and is a plummet down a chasm of idiocy. This musical has great songs that will make it a great musical for years to come. The attempt at updating the songs dooms this film to a dismal failure.",Annie
95,anymouse2,Remember the target audience is 6 year olds,3,26 December 2014,"The 1970s musical is still being performed. And people are happy to rewatch it. The 1982 film is on TV a few times a year, and adults can tolerate sitting through it.This? Belongs on the shelf next to ""Bob the Builder"", ""Dora the explorer"" and the rest of the infantile stuff your child should outgrow before starting the first grade, that you'll dig out in a decade to embarrass them.To suggest that these characters were ""one dimensional"" would give more credit to the writer than he deserves. We cant blame the actors, there simply wasn't anything there to work with. The moron took a work of art that had been around 90 years, and managed to miss any actual character content.Then we have the music; ye gods, the music. You don't take 70s Broadway and simply throw auto-tune and dime store canned hip hop ""beats"" (for lack of a more denigrating word) into it. Second, if your going to do a musical, thats FAMOUS, for the last 40 years, as a musical, hire people that can sing.And then there's the ""charming"" message buried in there to make Foxx happy: yeah sure, we get it. You think white people and rich people are the bane ruining the planet. Bigoted racist hypocrite.All-told, this was meant for today's 6 year olds. You know, the ones too doped up on Ritalin and under-educated to comprehend anything more than bright flashy lights and loud noises.",Annie
96,cesarbau,"Smart, comic but where's the heart?",7,22 January 2015,"THE RESURRECTED ""Annie"" movie, a somewhat confused attempt to revive the musical, is not as horrible as many critics say.The vocal renditions are terrific, including that of Annie's and Cameron Diaz's, the script bubbly and hip-hop youthful, with smart and often comic repartees. It seems that only three or four of the original Broadway musical numbers were kept, I must check that, but I did enjoy the new, One Direction-era numbers and the few superbly mounted sing-and- dance scenes, despite the mediocre choreography. More of those, please, I was thinking.Now the problems: Where are the cute-uplifting-sympathetic moments?  Why didn't the makeover team heed the old advice: ""You gotta have heart?"" The movie comes across as a musical-wannabe instead of an all-out musical, giving half a nod of what made the original stage production a hit and partly oblivious of it, aiming instead to create another hit. A confusion of ambitions if there was one. Promising preteen Quvenzhane Wallis who plays Annie has a sweet, engaging and lovely voice and refreshing screen presence. But her most likely unintended black-with-an attitude air does not fit the persona of a vulnerable Annie that a rich, dedicated loner and lonesome billionaire would love, let alone adopt. Bah, humbug!",Annie
97,the_remixer08,Great Family Movie for Today's Generation,7,23 March 2015,"I took my nine year old cousin to see this. He's a boy so I didn't think he was going to like it. I told him that the movie was about a girl and he still wanted to go and enjoyed it. As a true fan of the original Annie, I really enjoyed this one as well. I really don't understand anyone who would give a negative review on this. It's just a remake. Not made to be like the original but from a different perspective of one's mindset and as a tribute to the original. If you have kids, nieces or nephews and would like to have a fun movie night with them, this is a movie that is recommended. It has nice twist to it and I'm glad they made it to relate to today's generation of kids.",Annie
98,ViciousCXY,It's not a 1 star..,3,21 December 2020,"Uhh, so it came out in 2014 but I'm rewatching it and decided to come see it the reviews reflect how I feel about it.The target audience is definitely children, it's much harder in my opinion for anyone with an actual concept of what is good and bad to enjoy. I've noticed that with modern films or TV shows, a lot of the time child actors REALLY over-act, which is what happens in this film, a lot of mediocre drama-kid acting; which I guess annoys me since you'd think as we improve with time, that the standards of acting would also improve or at least.. Not stoop too low.
It's also weird how with modern movies we just NEED to auto-tune singing, and badly at that. Why not just hire someone who can actually sing? Just listening to this new rendition of 'Tomorrow' makes me wince.
Any warmth and spirit seems to have been sapped out of the movie with it's new modern setting, everything comes across as being really superficial, and even though the characters are nice, you never get to the point of really liking them.I'm giving it a 3 because the movie does still have structure, the characters are consistent throughout and there's no continuity inconsistencies.. But then again, all their key story points have already been laid out for them with the original Annie.",Annie

100,AmakoaAkana,Quvenzhané Wallis the perfect Annie,10,13 June 2017,"The 1982 Annie is one my top five most perfectly adorable movies of all time. To me it has a special place in the above ten star category, like fifteen stars. The story, music, choreography acting and flow were perfectly done. So, trying to compare the newer versions is difficult.This version of Annie is modernized, with cell phones and all kinds of electric gadgets. I didn't mind the modernization, it was fun to see the story in a different setting with enough new plot points to keep me wondering what going to happen next. The colors were brilliant, a real feast. The dance choreography is comparatively sparse, particularly ""Hard Knock Life"". There are additional songs, one of which (a rather quiet solo by Annie from her super-modern bed) I thought was a welcome addition, the others forgettable. The costumes were beautifully done. The movie as a whole was fun. My little nieces (6 & 12) watched it twice with sound full blast. What makes this version a ten star film rests on Quvenzhané Wallis being an absolute perfect Annie. No red hair, but well, her acting is adorable, funny, and lighter than air like the best young dancers. She out-sparkled even the very sparkly Aileen Quinn (Annie, 1982). Jamie Foxx as Stack is an extra bonus, a very funny ""Warbucks"". Taylor Richardson who introduces the movie as ""Red-haired Annie"" set the stage perfectly, so let me recommend seeing her more extensive role in Jack of the Red Hearts(2015), and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. The rest of the cast fine, but nothing to stand out or criticize.",Annie

103,tammyaphillips,This rendition of Annie could have been so much better,6,30 December 2014,"It is unfortunate so much money (65 million) and so much talent (Quvenzhane Wallis, Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz) did not equal a better movie. A musical should have great singers; this did not. Foxx, the orphans and Quvenzhane were fine, but they were not great. Consider Dreamgirls, Hairspray, Fiddler on the Roof and Oklahoma. Along with the actors singing in character, there were powerful voices. No one in Annie was a standout musically.Rose Byrne did her job in Damages, but not so much in this movie. The remainder of the cast was competent; they had their occasional moments.This rendition of Annie was okay. But, with a few cast changes and voice lessons, it could have been so much better.",Annie

Making a new version of a film is really a risky thing but you try your best on it, at least not to ruin it! How dare you thought that you have the right to ruin our childhood musical? Of course you haven't thought of it, you think that this will work and you'll earn a lot of money!! I am really sorry for my tongue but I hope the cast of Annie (1982) never watches this cause they'll be disappointed.If you watch this for the first time, I believe you'll like it but people like me, who knows the first version of it, will think like me.Instead of this, just watch the older one and get the happiness, sadness, courage, quality of music and dance, and so on all at once. Don't waste your time on this.",Annie
105,BklynBryanCM,Annie 2014 is ALL HEART!! Give it a chance!,7,18 December 2014,"I saw Annie and it was fantastic! I know how some people say NOT to remake a classic, but Annie is the exception. I did not like the Karate Kid remake, but Annie 2014 gets an A+ from me!! Quvenzhané Wallis did a wonderful job in the lead role of Annie. You really feel for her character and care what happens to her. The musical numbers were great. I actually liked Jamie Foxx's character Will Stacks and I am NOT a Jamie Foxx fan. But I feel that he was meant to play the role with his background in singing, dancing, and acting. Cameron Diaz took her ""Bad Teacher"" character up a few notches and created a diabolical villain!! She is so mean, nasty, and heartless. It was special to see how the characters progressed throughout the film and at the end. People can change! The soundtrack has an Urban NY flavor to it that I love!! I'm going to buy the CD or DL it ASAP!! Not fair to compare 2014 to 1982 as the times are extremely different now as opposed to then. But if I had to choose 1982 or 2014. I'd definitely go with 2014!! It is a shame if racism is lowering the rating of Annie 2014. Critics can criticize this version of Annie, but it had a lot of HEART.",Annie

107,stareyes24,Adorable Remake,7,27 January 2020,"I really enjoyed this version of Annie. I was born the year the original ""Annie"" movie came out and as a little girl I would watch it when it would come on NBC. I also would rent the movie as well. Being a huge Shirley Temple fan, I'm often surprised she never played the character since it would have been the perfect role for her.So, when this remake came out, I didn't see it on its initial run in the theater, but I watched it today and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Quevazhane Wallis was adorable as Annie. Is she the best singer? No, but she's got the spunk, determination, and charm that captures the character of Annie. Jamie Foxx is always good and so is Rose Byrne and Cameron Diaz.As an African American woman, I got a little choked up finally seeing a movie with a talented young lady play in a role that I would have loved to see 30 years ago. I remember when Keisha Knight Pulliam played in ""Polly"" a version of ""Pollyanna"" with an African American cast and it was spectacular. These roles are few and far between. Moving forward, I would to see more young ladies of color in starring roles.",Annie

This one is good for someone who is looking for a fun, updated version!",Annie
109,CoolKid23,Not Bad At All.,7,12 December 2014,Let me start off by saying that if you are one of those people that are mad because the character playing Annie is black and not white then you should be ashamed seriously. It's a movie at the end of the day and it's just imagination. No particular color is needed to tell a fictional story that never happen.Here's what I liked1.The girl playing Annie is adorable and she does a great job of acting. 2.Jamie Foxx does a decent job of acting. 3.It felt like a remake that did not try too hard which worked out.What I didn't like1.Script was poorly written and some scenes were hurried along and did not blend in well with the transitioning of the movie. 2.Cameron Diaz had some of her worst acting of her career as she did a horrible job of playing a drunk woman. 3.The supporting cast lacked any kind of charisma especially for an upbeat musical type of movie. 4. Some of the music bits were just kind of thrown at you and don't blend in well with the musical aspect that the movie is suppose to generate.ConclusionI enjoyed this movie with my son very much. I did not expect anything special because the scripts in Hollywood have been badly written in the last 2 or 3 years. Go see this with your family but don't expect too much. I gave it a 7 because I think you will enjoy it as a rental with your children. Don't pay to see this movie because it's not worth it.,Annie
110,lauramc-35776,Lots of great plotlines missed,6,16 February 2019,"I saw this on Amazon Prime. The original was one of my favorites. This movie misses the mark in so many ways. A lot of really important plotlines from the original movie are missing. Cameron Diaz is attractive and I have liked her in other roles (My Sister's Keeper and Bad Teacher), I just didn't like her as Miss Hannigan. Carol Burnett nailed that one.This movie is a modernized version of a classic. Too different from the original for me.",Annie
111,lauramc-35776,Interesting,6,19 February 2019,"Miss Hannigan, played by Cameron Diaz, is beautiful yet horrible to the girls. She is funny yet lacking in empathy and social skills. She is sad yet resentful and constantly dwelling over her past and what could have been. This character is very different from Miss Hannigan in the original, played by Carol Burnett, who was abusive and hated children, but did not want to see Annie die.The songs were changed to fit with present day. So were most of the story lines. That did mean that a lot of songs and plot lines that made the story were cut out of this version of Annie. The movie does reference some parts of the original. Annie gives a class presentation on FDR. Updated versions of songs from the original are played.But this movie is not the original. I have watched it repeatedly because I find the tunes to be catchy. The original is a classic. This movie is a take on what that storyline would look like today.Watch both.",Annie

113,lovellallen,"If your not prejudiced you will find it OK, nice family movie!",6,14 June 2015,"This film is not the best, but its okay and enjoyable.If you are racist, or have an issue with Annie being portrayed as a black child... Do NOT watch.This is not a film based on real life, its based on a musical and not a specific persons real life, so I personally think its okay in this circumstance to be played by different ethnicity, personally Id like to see a little Chinese or Indian Annie now.The way this has developed from the 1982 version is actually interesting, it could have been reprised in a much more outstanding way, but never the less it is still watchable and thoroughly enjoyable for its target audience.Will you like it more than the 1982 or straight to film 1999 version, probably not, however there are many laugh out loud moments when you leave all preconceptions, and prejudice conceptions at the door of the Theater.",Annie
114,yuukiftb,Love it,10,21 December 2015,"Annie is a little orphan girl, who is looking for her parents every day. She lives in an orphanage with other girls. One day, when she is chasing a running dog, she is hardly run over by car. The person who helps Annie is Will Stacks, the mayor of New York City. He is evaluated by what he did. So as to get more votes, he and his secretary welcomes Annie to their palatial residence, and start living together. Annie knows that he is doing for the election, but for her, it is a good way to look for her parents too. How will the relationships be in the end? Can Annie find her parents? This movie is the remake version, and the previous one is shown a long time ago. Actually, I knew Annie, but I didn't have the opportunities to watch, so it was my first time. I was asked to watch this movie, and also I rent this DVD and watch a few times. I really like it. The story line is very good, and heartwarming. Also, since this is musical movie, about 10 songs are included. They make me very fun to watch, and didn't feel bored at all. I totally like everything.",Annie

But after a few minutes I was engrossed. I loved Quvenzhané Wallis as Annie - she has pizzaz !The costuming and set decorations were super and I thought it was well cast. The storyline and songs were great. The singing ability of the actors was fine - it suited the movie and gave it a ""down to earth"" appeal.Sure there are a few holes in the plot, and some parts could have been done differently, but does that really matter? It's a movie meant for enjoyment. Take it for what it is, without comparing it to earlier versions.I'd especially recommend it to those who aren't familiar with the originals.",Annie
117,decemberangel1286,A total rip off,1,24 December 2014,"This adaption of Annie is totally ludicrous I'm glad I only saw the movie once in the cinema. Not even believable and the actors totally over acted and Cameron Diaz is not even on the same planet and the movie is not even funny. I nearly fell asleep watching it, I liked the original much better. People may love this version but its one of the worst remakes there is on the planet. Remakes are never as wonderful as the original. Annie never should have been re done. The songs are song off key and the script should be thrown at the director and the writers. This movie is not worth ten cents. I give this a 1/10 and that's being nice. Jamie Fox was worst person to play William Stacks its so dry and the humor is not there. Annie was one of the best movies there was and now the remakes have come out they don't compare. This movie is one of the worst remakes and makes you wanna grind your teeth listening to this dribble. Thousands spent on the movie and yet still not even enjoyable, nothing about this adaption was enjoyable and the lame jokes. What is with Cameron Diaz and acting like she's miss thing? She was nothing but a drama queen who needed a life.",Annie

The end was a typical Hollywood happy ever after cliché. Now yes I know 5-10 year old girls would like this film but that's as far as it goes. Personally I think this film deserved the razzie for worst remake.I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone because of it being a absolute terrible film",Annie

It was never intended to be the same as the original. Its a modern take on an old tale. Thats it. I had no problems with the acting, I thought Cameron Diaz was funny and Jamie Fox hilarious. People just need to pull the carrot out of their BEHINDS and learn to enjoy things. I've seen the past 2 Annie movies with my daughter and weve enjoyed both so we were looking forward to this one a lot but before we saw it we had already accepted that it wasn't going to be the same but we still loved it.

121,Jo-Cino,"A Perfect Storm - Inspirational , Upbeat, Fun, Good Music, Good Message",8,12 December 2014,"I'm in my early 40's so i'm one of the ones that actually remembers the original Annie and honestly, i can't exactly say that i was the biggest fan of the original. Maybe it's just me, but i thought it was 'ok' at best.We first saw the trailer for this movie over the summer and at first i was thinking, ""really?...Annie?""... but the more the trailer played, the more i was able to actually feel that there was a very different VIBE to this movie than the original, so yes - i was sold and wanted to see this based on the trailer.After actually seeing the movie in its entirety with my seven year old daughter, what i came away with was a BIG smile on my face and such an upbeat and inspirational feeling that still has me gushing today. My daughter can't stop talking about this movie either.There was definitely an upbeat kinda VIBE throughout this entire movie that never quite leaves your side and should somehow be cast as an extra it's that good. It's also gone through a much needed makeover and is suddenly very up to date and modern (which is a lot of fun to see happen) The acting, i thought, was pretty spot on - keeping in mind that these characters are supposed to have a bit of animation to them (it IS a children's musical for crying out loud). Jamie Foxx once again shows his flexibility and endless talent in his role as Willie Stacks. The man can do it all. Quvenzhané is absolutely perfect for this movie and i might actually be more grateful that little Willow Smith 'backed out' of the lead of this movie opening the door for 'Q' than any thing else cause i can't see anyone else nailing this role down as perfectly as she did. Cameron Diaz, i thought, was a lot of fun and i even enjoyed her singing - not going to win any awards any time soon, but the moments she had were again, spot on for what the moment called for (and that's important to understand for a movie like this). Rose Byrne was ... 'proper' :-). Bobby Cannavale reminded me very much of a modern day John Larroquette - the kind of guy that just knows how to be the perfect, lovable D-Bag... you almost feel bad for loving him the way you do - but you still do.The music, another major highlight to this movie, was also nicely done and scores a big assist to singer/songwriter Sia who did wonders for this movie. With some new songs added (see 'Opportunity' and 'Smiles' to name a couple) and a few changes to the originals, the soundtrack is already on my daughters Christmas list. Don't discount this as this helps change the entire tone of the movie.All in all, i thought this movie was a perfect storm. It had a lot of intangibles working seamlessly together. I gave this movie a nine because it was a lot of fun, it was very upbeat and inspirational, had good music, a good message, and a lot of cute laughs.Normally i would highly suggest seeing this movie if you had kids, especially any little girls - but - I think even as an adult without kids, this movie can still find a way to creep into your heart and make you love it just the same.Recommended!",Annie

There's only one remake I've ever seen in my life that I can honestly say did it pretty right. ... this is definitely not it. Miracle on 34th Street (1994), with Richard Attenborough as old St. Nick, and darling Mara Wilson as the little girl, really took pains to get the feel of the time right, and only updated it where necessary ever so gently, bring us a very enjoyable, respectfully handled remake.This feature tOtally dismisses, and ignores the time in which the classic, original ""Annie"" took place, the thinking and feel of the time, the whole shmear! Somebody said it so well.. that if they tried to pull this kind of ""remake"" stunt on classic plays and productions such as Porgy n' Bess, or Show Boat, or The Mikado, turning it all into an all WHITE cast, it not only would cause an apocalyptic FUROR---it would make absolutely NO SENSE!

OK, a 1 out of 5 would make sense for someone who totally hate everything about a movie.Yeah, I get it.. different faces and a breach away from the original Annie musical, OK, then we take away points for originality.. Well how about individual character acting, OK, then we slam points off for poor acting.. What about the feel and plot of the movie? Was it entertaining, maybe funny, interesting?I'm making the point that Annie falls far short of originality, however, entertaining and acting was not sub-par worthy of a senseless 1 out of ten..I have seen too many movie ratings ruined by people personal 1 out of ten ratings which should be more of a 4 or 5 out of 10. And I also know the reverse of some people like myself who may rate a movie 10 just to offset those ridiculous 1 out of 10 ratings.Anyhow, the movie was good for an updated version of Annie, great entertainment for the family. It definitely deserves better ratings than a 3 or lower.I recommend this movie for great family entertainment and a twist of the original Annie.",Annie

Quvenzhané Wallis plays the one dimensional character, Annie, who apparently knows the outcome of every scene. She displays no emotion and she treats the luxury lifestyle like if she has been there before. When she discovers that her parents are fake, I expected her to display an emotion of fear and fright because she is being kidnapped. However, she displays a dull attitude because it appears that she knows that she is going to be eventually saved. I am still surprised that she was nominated for a golden globe. Now Cameron Diaz is a big shame as she plays the evil Miss Hannigan. Sadly, her acting looks forced, over the top and exaggerated. C'mon Cameron Diaz you are better than this. Jamie Foxx's acting is OK but is not the best of his acting career. I expected to hear the original songs from composer Charles Strouse and lyricist Martin Charnin, but the music is all auto-tuned which is disappointing for the fans of Annie. Don't waste your time with this movie. Watch the Annie 1999 or the 1982 which are far more better than this 2014 version. The only cool thing of this film was watching Michael J. Fox...for a few seconds. Now if you'll excuse me, I am going to Michael J. Fox if I could borrow his time machine car, DeLorean, to go back in time and stop this Annie 2014 from being made.",Annie
127,kvalentine926-189-516307,A good update of a classic movie,8,22 December 2014,"I am very disappointed in the low mark given to this well made update of the movie Annie.I have seen the 1980's version of Annie many times.While Cameron Diaz can't really compare to the comedic genius of Carol Burnett, her change of heart towards the end of the movie is still very affecting.I loved Quvenzhene Wallis' portrayal of Annie in this movie.Thank goodness, Willow Smith passed up on this movie.Quvenzhene showed so much heart and determination and talent in this movie that I felt proud to watch this young girl growing up in this movie.Critics have noted that the director Will Gluck must not have been comfortable in presenting more musical numbers in this movie but I did enjoy the musical numbers that were there such as the seen where Annie received some bad news about the search for her parents and sang the song"" Tomorrow ""thru the streets of New York to show that she was still determined to try to find her parents. The musical scene for the song ""I think I 'm going to like it here"" was updated and well done. I loved the new song written by Sia called ""Opportunity"" which symbolized what all children need in order to fulfill their potential in life.Overall, I enjoyed all the performances and liked the changes made to the story from the 1980's version.",Annie

This movie has some of the worst acting i've ever seen especially from Cameron Diaz (why is she still acting)Overall 0/10!!!",Annie
129,shimotorres,Why all the bad reviews? We liked it!,7,24 December 2014,"I'm not sure why the IMDb rating is so low, or why there's all the hate - unless it's purely racial. I took my two daughters to see it (8 & 11), and we all liked it and rate it a 7.Granted, I never saw the other two movie versions or the musical, or any version of Annie, period. I knew the general storyline, and know it's based on a comic strip. So maybe people get vested in a character looking a certain way. Whatever. I thought it was a cute twist to cast it this way (and no disrespect to Will Smith and Jada, love them - but I'm glad the lead wasn't Willow, as originally intended). Some family films, I have high expectations. Some, I just want a decent movie I can see with my kids. This filled the latter bill.I like Jaime Fox. His singing was passable, in key but not very strong. (He performed more strongly as Ray Charles.) I enjoyed his comedic and thoughtful bits. Quvenzhané is spunky and likable. Her voice was pretty good and clear in some songs, but others, especially ""Opportunity"", I suspected some auto-tuning...which then made me wonder about all the singing...Rose Byrne had a nice voice (and note - she was doing all her dancing in heels!). Cameron Diaz's voice is OK. As cute and likable as Cameron can be, she was great at playing trashy and despicable. Yes, she was over the top, but I think she was supposed to be the comic relief. I also enjoyed the Family Services worker (Kurtzuba).I think the movie did what it was supposed to - Annie was likable, someone you rooted for, the ""villan"" (Diaz) was repugnant yet you could forgive her when she got back on track, the somewhat jerky workaholic (Fox) softening up and learning how to have fun again made you smile, Fox and Byrne conveyed the affection they felt for Annie, we felt badly when Annie is whisked away by her ""parents"", and it had a happy ending. We laughed a lot. The songs, for the most part, added something and were enjoyable. (My oldest is singing ""Tomorrow"" to herself right now) This movie is not a 4.5. I've seen bad movies. This was not one of them. If you want a fun, clean, non-violent film family film you can take the kids to - and you're open-minded enough not to care about ""color"" in a ""traditionally"" white role - see Annie.",Annie

But, it's not the greatest movie ever.",Annie
133,fred-m-stabs,Not too bad as a NYC kid movie; terrible as an Annie re-make,5,30 December 2014,"Unlike many other reviewers, I did not completely hate nor love this movie. Overall, I was disappointed and I did not consider it worth the cost of the ticket (my daughter wanted to see it). The reason that it was so bad comes from a failed attempt at carrying on the title of the musical Annie.The musical bits were embarrassingly bad and completely out of place in the movie. The movie did not follow the traditional Annie story at all times, and where it did is where it was stunk the worst. I have never actually cringed in a movie that I was seeing in a theater until this one. Honestly, some parts of this movie would make a straight-to-cable B-movie look like great film making.On the positive side, the non-Annie parts of the movie were not so bad. Nothing was particularly great, but it had the potential to be a typical Hollywood formula movie about the young kid being taking in by the kind adult, with happy endings, etc. The completely up-to-date take on life was relatively new, and at least a couple of bits were almost amusing.If they had just dropped the horrid song and dance numbers and all references to the Broadway musical, this could have been just another kid movie. Children who have little or no knowledge of musicals, or the story of Annie, are likely to see this as a Disney Channel quality movie and might enjoy it. However, if you are not one of those children - then you have been warned!",Annie
134,jadeylady96,Incredibly better than expected.,8,29 January 2015,"I don't write reviews, in fact this is my first. Annie is my favourite musical, although admittedly the 1999 version. I watched this without much knowledge of the film, other than the cast. I thought another remake was uncalled for but watched it regardless.It's a more modernised version of the musicals and at times completely different story-line, with subtle parts from the previous versions.I'm tough with ratings usually, I don't give things 10/10 unless I could honestly admit I'd watch it repeatedly. It would have gotten a 9 but one song particularly annoyed me. Too auto-tuned and totally ruined the song with new lyrics. Discarding that, watch this film as a totally new film and enjoy it with lovable memories from the past films. It's actually quite good, better than expected.",Annie
135,leafshadow231,Best family offer,9,3 January 2015,"I thought a thousand times before going because I was getting carried away by some critics. I should have gone before. The film is a refreshing break from the Christmas rush. Jamie Foxx's voice was enough warranty for me that at least his participation will like me. Possibly many will make comparisons with earlier versions of Annie, but this is different and that's what people want to see at Christmastime. Without pretensions of being a classic, or overcome any previous version this Annie is enough to fill fun and emotional expectations. Obviously has the proper classification suitable for all public, classification that was not properly applied to Into the woods that could have been PG13. One of the best productions of the cinematographic industry this Christmas.",Annie
136,paulsebaypost,Annie 2014 Vs Annie 1982 result no contest,1,3 January 2015,"The 1982 Annie was my kids favorite movie and they watched it over and over again, So I got to know it pretty well. It was full of charm, character, drama and some very fine acting ALL of which is missing from this latest version. First the character of Annie totally lacked the sparkle of the original played by Aileen Quinn Second the other kids where as dull as dishwater Third Miss Hannigan what the hell was that Cameron? Carol Burnett I think deserved an Oscar for her portrayal of the best character in the 82 Annie Forth Daddy Warbucks or whatever his name was in this Jamie Foxx please don't try singing again it was sooo bad, if in fact it was him singing Fifth Grace she was so dull in this I had forgotten she was in it until I thought back to the 82 Annie. This version was always going to be compared with the original and so I'm supervised it fell so short of it. I'm not even sure why they tried to update it when the 82 version is still just as appealing to the age range (girls 7 to 12) as it was then. I watched this 2014 version with my youngest now 17 and who had previously seen and enjoyed the 82 version. She was so disappointed with it she dug out the 82 Annie video and watched that to clear the bad memories of watching this new mess. So will it appeal to girls 7 to 12 who have never seen the original?? maybe but I don't think on anything like the scale of the original.",Annie
137,indiaodonohoe,these reviews are all horrid.,9,25 March 2020,"I love this film. I really do. Sure maybe the acting isn't top notch, and maybe the jokes are corny and the songs auto tuned, but I absolutely love it. Sure it's not a match to the first Annie, but maybe it wasn't supposed to be. This film does exactly what it advertises to do. It's a really fun, feel good family film. And I really liked the songs. And I adored Cameron Diaz. Sure her acting wasn't exactly incredible, but she's really funny, and brings a lot to the film. It's not oscar worthy, but it's a really cute film and a brilliant way to spend 2 hours in my opinion. I guarantee unless you're as stone hearted as the rest of these reviewers you will come out smiling.",Annie

139,jon-broeke,"The update to the classic musical hits the screens this week, and it's an absolute triumph",9,26 January 2015,"There is always a big risk when you take something as loved as Annie and change it. Usually there is something lacking in the remake, the thing that made the original such a success is just not there. Thanksfully that's not the case in this instance, and I think it's because the film doesn't feel like a remake of the original. It comes across more like a sequel, paying tribute to the original at all times, but, at the same time, making it into a new and original film in its own right. Which works really well. Of course, Annie wouldn't be Annie without the music. The originals are here, including Tomorrow, It's a Hard Knock Life, Maybe, and Little Girls, all of which have been re-worked and updated with thicker beats and interesting new arrangements, which work really well. I loved the way they updated the classics songs, while keeping the hearts of them the same. Then there are the new songs, written for the film, which are all great. They fit perfectly in with the classics songs, but give the movie an added layer that lifts it up a notch. Of course, the songs would mean little without the voices to carry them off. Wallis has a very sweet voice, but it's also strong enough to carry off a song with as much resonance as Tomorrow. Diaz does a great job with Little Girls, not imitating Carroll Burnett, the original Miss. Hannigan, but giving it her own spin, and thoroughly succeeding. The highlight in the film, as far as voice is concerned, is Foxx. He has an incredible voice which he uses beautifully in the new music written for the film. I had goose bumps when he opened his mouth, which was great. Everything in the film works, from the music, to the update of the story, to the performances by everyone from Wallis and her foster sisters, to Foxx, cleaning his hands with disinfectant all the time. The film makers did a really good job with the film. I suggest you watch the original Annie and then go to cinemas to see this one. You'll see the similarities and differences in both and love them equally for what they both are, great movie musicals.",Annie
140,lawyer24,I love this movie,8,7 October 2015,"Perfect casting, great music, good acting, wonderful choreography and nice story. I have this film on DVD. I have a young daughter. When the weather is bad on a weekend my daughter and I will stay home often times and watch movies. Annie is on rotation and has been watched numerous times in my house. Every song that comes on, my daughter pretends to be Annie and I'm Will Stacks. LOL. There are so many songs that we love in this movie, I really can't say which one is the favorite. We have our own dance routine to match Annie and Stacks's ensemble at the end. Truly a great family movie and a joy to watch. Really, words do no justice to how much I enjoy this film.",Annie

I think it's all crap. This movie wasn't bad. I liked the singing from Quevenzhane Wallis and Jamie Foxx. I did think that Rose Byrne and Cameron Diaz's singing seemed really fake. It shows that they can't sing and needed a lot of lip sync for their voices to sound good. Speaking of Rose Byrne, I thought she was going to have a lot of trouble with this role. I didn't think she was a type of person to do a musical and dance and sing. I knew that her acting was going to be great, and it was. I could really feel the connection between her and Annie. There was a lot of emotional parts of the movie. Annie was not only really connected to Grace but also to Daddy Warbucks, played by Jamie Foxx. Quvenzhanne Wallis wasn't bad in the movie. I didn't think it was as good as her previous movie, Beasts of the Southern wild. She was still good though. You see all these child actors that just read their lines off. Quevenzhanne did make me feel the anger and sadness of being an orphan and being betrayed. The classic songs were great and I really liked the choreography. Overall I gave the movie a 7.",Annie
143,mkm134-1,Andrew Llyod Webber must be screaming!,1,17 March 2015,"It claims to be a remake but it was horrible! The songs were like rock songs and the storyline was borderline ridiculous. Cameron Diaz was pretty bad, let's just say she's no Carol Burnett. Jamie Foxx, Rose Byrne and the little girl who played Annie were great in the role, it was the script and storyline that was horrid. We already knew Jamie Foxx could sing after Ray, but they didn't even let him do that. They would've been better off selling it as a happy heart warming movie instead of a remake. Why mess with a good thing? There's a reason it's been in Broadway for decades. I wanted to give it a shot, but it was worse than I expected. What a shame! Best part-- the dog was adorable.",Annie
144,petersjared41,Disappointing,6,9 February 2015,"When a musical as loved as Annie hits the cinema's, it better be amazing! This unfortunately is a failure. I did not like how the depression era backdrop was changed to modern day NYC. I think right away this took some of the charm away from the production. This really was not good. The acting overall was pretty appalling. The lead was pretty good. The whole film is like vanity press when someone publishes their own novel. With the producers being Jay –Z and Will Smith , the whole thing was contrived and uncomfortable. Perhaps they should stick to what they are good at – music production not film production. It really is a ""hard knock life"" for this film. Its such a shame, it could have been amazing but just falls totally flat.",Annie
145,kimNON,"""Annie""",9,18 December 2015,"""Annie"" is a film adaptation of Broadway musical. This story is about Annie, who is an orphan and believes and waits her parents, and Stacks, who is a CEO of the cellphone company and a candidate for a mayor in NY. Stacks and Annie live together in his extremely high apartment. At the beginning, he takes advantage of her for the election campaign to rise his popularity. Annie gradually causes him to change his mind, and he makes decision to take her on as his daughter. But, Annie is taken away by sham parents. Stacks tries to take back her.When it comes to ""Annie"", many people think of tomorrow, of course I love it. But I was touched by ""The City's Yours"", song by Jamie Foxx and Quvenzhane Wallis in the helicopter. I can see that their relationship becomes deeper. Their harmonies are pretty good. This movie includes laughter and tears. Also, I think Cameron Diaz plays good role in the movie.",Annie
146,hannahszal,Loved It the First Time and I Still Love It Now,7,15 February 2019,"Is this the best musical, comedy, or family film? No, it's not, but does that mean you can't enjoy it? Absolutely not.I saw this movie in theaters with my sisters, nieces and nephews and absolutely loved it. Having watched it recently, sure, it's not perfect by any means--especially with the writing, dialogue and some of the lyrics--but I still love it as much as I did when I saw it the first time.It's definitely a movie that you can enjoy and have fun with, especially if you don't have high expectations and just want an entertaining, family-friendly movie.The cast, songs, comedy, and character development are still well-done to a certain degree, and even if you haven't seen the original like I have, again, you can still enjoy this film. All you gotta do is give it a chance. You might even be surprised. Either way, I love this movie and it's one of my favorite musicals next to 2007's Hairspray and 2008's Enchanted, as well as 1989's The Little Mermaid. That's how much I love this film. Plus, Cameron Diaz, Jamie Foxx, Wallis' performance, and the fact that Sia helped write the songs just make it even better. Trust me, you'll see what I mean. Ignore the haters and watch this film.",Annie
147,GazDutlow,There is a lot for everyone to enjoy here.,6,5 January 2015,"http://whatdidgazthinkof.blogspot.com.au/2015/01/annie.html Should we remake ""classics""? When the trailer was released in March, there was considerable debate... Maybe it's just me, but the original 'Annie'(1989) isn't on the same level of ""untouchable"" as Judy Garland's 'Wizard of Oz'. Regardless, with this new version Jay-Z and team have produced a film that is not only important, but fun and lively.In the role of Annie is Oscar nominated actress Quvenzhane Wallis, who shines bright in the midst of her co-stars. The new Annie is still resourceful, street-smart and full of sass, now being portrayed as a foster child (rather than orphan) under the tyranny of Miss Hannigan (Cameron Diaz). After a run in with mayoral candidate Will Stacks (the crooning Jamie Foxx), Annie finds herself in a new world of opportunity. Stacks thinks Annie will be the key to him winning the election, and Annie happily plays along for his photo opportunities. After all, she's on a bigger mission to find her long lost parents.As you can see, the story you know remains largely intact. Will it achieve the status the original did? We all know the answer to that. This is light holiday entertainment; and there is nothing wrong with that. The dialogue fizzes with humour and the actors have fun with their musical numbers. Rose Byrne (from 'Bridesmaids', 'The Internship') and Wallis have a blast in a high-rise New York penthouse with ""I Think I'm Going to Like it Here"", and Diaz (though struggling in many of her scenes) tears up ""Easy Street"".Director Will Gluck ('Easy A') handles the production in the best way he knows how (as a comedy rather than a musical), often opting for snappy editing rather than choreography. It's a let down the film forgets to accompany its fun new soundtrack with dancing to match. The film survives by letting its eleven-year-old star shine.Which is exactly why this film is important. Strip it all away, and we have a talented black girl playing Annie. This casting has provided black children with the license to dream big! My little cousin proudly told her mother, that if her school were to put on a production of 'Annie', she would audition for the main role. As Quvenzhane Wallis sings an original song called ""Opportunity"" (watch below), we truly are witnessing her moment in the spotlight - a moment that many other children can now dream for.There is a lot for everyone to enjoy here. The cameos are smart, the laughs are plenty, and Annie has enough charisma to light New York City. But because it's not a perfect masterpiece, the critics have been harsh. But hey, it's a hard knock life.Annie is in cinemas now. What did you think of the new take on an old classic?",Annie
148,wordglow,Truly Awful,1,29 February 2016,"This version of Annie is truly awful. I have seen the two previous version several times, and there was no need for another, especially given the treatment this time around. Can you imagine a hip hop version of the Sound of Music or My Fair Lady? Some respect should be shown to the originators of these pieces of work. This Annie is merely a distortion of an iconic show and it appears the public agreed it wasn't worth the effort.While the part of Annie is played by a very talented girl, other roles were so bad that it is doubtful any actor could have made it palatable. I particularly disliked Miss Hannigan in this movie, and her version of Little Girls was plain angry. And the movie completely destroyed ""I'm Going to Like It Here,"" especially with the new lyrics. Annie was never a perfect musical, but compared to this version, the original sure seems that way.",Annie

They had a wonderful time.First of all I truly enjoy musicals on the big screen, secondly I am a huge fan of Cameron Diaz fan, I can't believe her role almost went to Sandra Bullock. Cameron was perfect for this role and it was absolutely fun to watch her bring back the 90's.The plot while predictable was paired with a modern day twist which was highly unpredictable and amusing.I never knew Jamie Foxx had such a beautiful singing voice. I will return to the theater to see this movie again before the new year and I will purchase the DVD when it becomes available.This really is the perfect holiday family movie. Hopefully you will not allow the multitude of bigots on IMDb prevent you from enjoying this amazing moving. I suggest checking the poster's history however, when people make statements such as the previous Annie ""Was so beautiful and fair"" or ""How can we believe he is rich with that ghetto accent"" their racism shines through like a meteor in a dark alley. These folks have a pattern of giving low ratings to all movies with African American leads. In fact, many of these comments are almost laughable. Um, how can we believe Jamie Foxx is rich? Perhaps because he IS actually rich in real life and by the way he didn't grow up in a ghetto. It is nice to fact check outside of one's tiny head prior to posting. IMHO",Annie
150,creepycarray,No.,1,26 December 2014,"Even giving this film 1/10 is nice. How this film even has big name actors I will never know, and that is the only thing it has going for it. Like many people agree, the songs seemed forced and not natural at all and they even acknowledged this at one point which, for a musical, is not good at all. The singing sounded like computers were doing it rather than real people.Not only was the singing, script and acting terrible but the whole plot is based on modernising the original film so its almost unrecognisable. The plot is pushed forward through the means of product placement and social media to an embarrassing amount where they may as well have hired Jamie Foxx to stand on screen talking about Windows phones for an hour and a half instead. It would have been more bearable to sit through.Annie (1982) was a timeless classic that did not need to be remade at and I had no hope for this film in the first place but this reached rock bottom. I see the only reason for giving this film more than 2/10 would be if you were paid.Definitely the worst film of the year.",Annie

In fact, I put them on my playlist while I'm at work. Well back to the movie, Compared with 2014 version I like the original version more.. because more emotional and more attractive, especially at the climax where She was being chased and climbing up the bridge. In 2014 version, they made a climax in different kind of way. Anyway, there's nothing wrong to see it. I gave 6 out of 10 for this movie.",Annie

Mr. Stacks was such a funny, hygienic, character, and my family and I had a good laugh about it on the way home.The movie director did such an amazing job of having a 21st Century Annie movie, one that is still relatable and good quality.

I NEVER wanted to see this movie because I knew that this reboot was gonna ruin the first movie. I sat down and was there for one reason only: the popcorn. This movie just ruins the original sooooo bad! First of all, Wallis (Annie) can kinda sing, but she can't act. Well, in this movie anyway. I really wonder what the director was saying to her. Some songs come in with absolutely no purpose whatsoever. And even worse, the little girls' voices are even more high pitched and annoying. Probably the thing that ruined this movie the most though is the ending itself. When Mr. Stacks saves Annie finally, she is still mad at him. Then, all of a sudden she's happy when he gets out of the election. It seems so boring, so short. Overall, the movie is freaking boring and low quality and I wouldn't pay 1 CENT to see this.",Annie

She knows there's a catch, and he admits the plan. She jokes that he could be president if she moved in. The adults get somebody to approve the temporary guardianship for Will. Annie then takes a tour around the place and is impressed with everything (""I Think I'm Gonna Like It Here"").Will sets the plan in motion by allowing Annie out to do whatever she wants. They adopt the dog from the streets (to Will's dismay), and Annie names it Sandy. He later takes Annie and the foster girls to the premiere of a movie called MoonQuake Lake'. The girls are taken back to the foster home, and Hannigan orders them to take back all the nice things they got. She once again bemoans her current position in life (""Little Girls""). Gray gets endorsed by Michael J. Fox, leading Will to get a bit desperate. He decides to take Annie on a ride over the city in his chopper (""The City's Yours"").Annie joins Will, Grace and Guy at the Guggenheim Museum for a Stacks Mobile event called ""A Night at The Museum"". Will invites Annie up on stage for the people to see her in her red dress. She sings ""Opportunity"", and the orchestra joins in. After the performance, Guy tells Annie to read a speech that he wrote. Annie is quiet and leaves the stage upset. Will and Grace run after her, and Annie admits that she doesn't know how to read. Will says he will get her a tutor.Guy devises a plan to get fake parents for Annie to get her off Will's hands. Guy teams up with Hannigan to set their scheme in motion (""Easy Street""), because, if Will looks heroic and reunites Annie with her parents, Guy gets a nice reward. Hannigan later auditions a bunch of actors to play the part, but is not pleased with any of them.Don't Listen To Negative Comments And Ignore Unjust Critics!.See This Movie. I am absolutely certain you will love it.",Annie
155,johnobvich,!982 version is much better,1,5 August 2015,"I enjoyed the songs from the 1982 version much better than this one. This version seemed to of been made because there isn't enough ""black"" movies out there. I also found that all of the singers in the 82 version could actually sing! In fact Aileen Quinn who played Annie has had a very successful career singing after the musical. The adult cast for this version also can not compete at all with the 82 version! You had Tim Curry, Carol Burnett, Albert Finney, heck you even had Geoffrey Holder who was the 7-Up guy who always laughed ""Ha Ha Ha Ha"" in the commercials! Speaking of the orphans in the 82, ALL of them could sing! This version, it sounds all dubbed in! In fact the girl who played Annie in this version CAN'T sing at all!You can believe the Oscar hype all you want but the 1982 version had better songs, better cast, and was actually script-written for the time period of the comic. This is just a sad attempt to make blacks be noticed in Hollywood.",Annie

What did you expect haters? Shakespeare? Some of the criticism I have read are completely unfounded and luckily we went ahead and watched the movie. We all enjoyed it (2 adults and two young children) and just wonder what could justify such a rating, we are dumbfounded. Racism or a coordinated action to torpedo this Sony movie? Some of the songs are powerful - I am thinking about Who am I? and the City is yours - and Jamie Foxx is good in his role. Go ahead people and watch it, make an opinion for yourself at least. I will from now on take ratings on this site with a big pinch of salt, much bigger than before to be clear",Annie
160,maryanncostello,Bummer,3,27 December 2014,"The writers did a good job of putting the story of Annie in the 21st Century. As a musical it stunk though. It seems someone in charge knew this as all (almost all) the orchestrations were set to overpower the bad vocals. The original music was well... bad. This Annie was cute enough, and maybe comparisons aren't fair exactly, but she couldn't sing or dance. The acting was OK but for the musical parts. Jamie Fox looked like he just wanted out of the flick. He had only a moment or two convincing me he was in character. Camron Diaz was campy fun and dealt with bad material as good as anyone could. This movie is for those who do not much care about music and dance.",Annie
161,tblaeducation,A Black Annie? really?,1,3 January 2015,"Total disappointment here. This would be like having Angelina Jolie play Tina Turner in the movie about Tina And Ike. So what's next liberal Hollywood? the Sound of Music from the hood? There are movies that should be played by black actors and those that should be played by white actors. Sometimes those acting positions can be switched but definitely not in a classic like this. Certain movie classics like Miracle on 34th Street, the Wizard of Oz, A Streetcar Named Desire, To Kill a Mockingbird should be played by the people intended to play them or dare I say it, white people. Seems awfully dumb to reprise a classic simply to switch up the race of the cast in order to make money on it among a new group. Hollywood simply has no shame when it comes to making money and this is certainly no exception. Skip this one folks.",Annie
162,kittredgemkittylissiegir,Annie Reminds Us Of Our Inner Child,8,21 December 2014,"People tend to like classics just because they are classics. People tend to stand by it even if the original is not as good as newer versions. Set aside biases when watching this movie. This Annie was not better than the original 1982 Annie, but it was darn near close to it. When people talk about making a modern adaptation to a story that was originally set in the 1930's, it's natural to be skeptical. I'm going to tell you right now: Whenever you think of a classic story adapting to fit a modern age, Annie shows us the right way to go about it.Instead of the freckly, curly-afro, pale-skinned, red-headed Annie, we are given a brown-skinned, bushy haired Annie with a reddish tint, which I found to be a good supplement. Normally, replacing a white girl just to make the story more appealing to African Americans doesn't always work, but for Annie, it does.We all know this is a children's movie, so the story fills 2 hours out to meet the clichéd happy ending people seem to be so against nowadays. I think that's what I liked most about it. It was modern, but it used a classic story-telling scheme that never fails. It's so much more than I can say about the recent slew of children's films that lose me with ""randomness"" as they try to break ""stereotypes"", ""twist"" everything, and fail to push social agendas as a result. This movie focused on story-development and had the story I wish the original Annie had. I also like the fact that the music was modernized. Don't get me wrong, I love the old songs. But I like the fact that those in charge did not take the songs that mattered out of the movie. I also like the fact that they added songs that fit better with this new story. And I'm thankful it was a musical and that they didn't pull a ""Great and Powerful Oz"".As awkward as it was for Jamie Foxx to be singing in this kind of musical, I kind of liked the little duet he had with Annie in the helicopter. What I appreciated about this movie was how they brought the character Annie into a modern life without taking away the heart of Annie, which is a lot more than I can say about the 1999 versionAnnie, as we know, is a spunky little girl, with a clever mischievous mind. The 1980's Annie was spunkier, I'll give her that, but this new Annie was more perceptive and intelligent. Somehow, they managed to use her new personality quirks to charm the audience in a whole new way. But she was definitely just as strong, positive, and confident as the old Annie.In comparison to so many children's movies today, I felt the concept of the characters was pretty interesting. They didn't rush the introduction of ANY characters and gave us time to grow and learn about each character. Each character had a story, and many stories were a little different from the original to fit with a more modern society. The performance value was low. First off, the acting wasn't too good, but every actor/actress did the job. Cameron Diaz was no Carol Burnett, but she did the job of showing us a new Miss Hannigan in a modern world. Would she have been my first pick? No. But she sure does know how to give a mean, tired-looking scowl. The shrieking in every sentence made her seem like an over-exaggerated wicked witch, but nonetheless she moves the story along. I mean, she is the only person who manages to show emotion on her face in this whole entire movieI probably would've chosen someone else for Will Stacks. Someone I know is a family man, like Eddie Murphy or Cuba Gooding JrJamie Foxx? Not entirely a comfortable fit for the movie, but he and Quvenzhané Wallis had chemistry. I think he really did fall in love with AnnieEven if his acting had a funny way of creating that feeling on-screen.The new Grace with the British accentI guess gives a nod to how interested Americans have become over the U.K.? Ya know, with all of U.K.'s biggest artists dominating our chartsAnother noticeable down-side to the performance value was the literal performance of the songs. While I'm glad the songs were in there, the immaculate dancing and singing was not matching up to par with the originalAnd let's face it, half of us went to see it for the musical numbers that remind us of the ""good ol' days"". I didn't care that Quvenzhané Wallis was not a singer because neither was the original Annie. But auto-tuning is definitely not the way to combat the vocal stretch.Overall, though, I was very pleased with Annie. This is not for people who like a whole lot of action, but for people who like touching stories that are appropriate for the whole family. It stuck to traditional story-telling, which left it solid and without holes. It served to brighten our day and make us smile at the sweet tender moments of childhood.",Annie
163,jennipenny2,Great movie,10,2 January 2015,"I thought it was a great movie. I grew up watching the old Annie and I loved this one just as much. The original Annie made you feel happy for Annie and Mr Warbuck but this Annie made you feel good about yourself and your family. I thought the new songs were catchy and enjoyable. The only bad thing I can see was that Cameron Diaz's acting was a bit over exaggerated but besides that, it was great. I had no problem at all with the actors being black, in fact, I didn't even think about it until I came on here and read the disgusting comments. All the people that grew up with the old Annie and are hating on this one need to stop because this is an updated version on the story that was made for the next generation. Just think of the poor little girls in the movie reading your disgusting comments.",Annie
164,liciaswork,Entertaining and fun,7,2 January 2015,"My family, from Grandma to 11 year old, really enjoyed this movie. The music from Sia was really great, my daughter recognized the style right away. Annie is not one of my favorite musicals, not even close, but I kept catching myself smiling while watching. I guess it's that whole kid dream of being adopted by a wealthy tycoon and getting all the candy you eat. LOL WIsh there were more dancing, great choreography could have put this movie over the top. Quvenzhane was really endearing, a real modern Annie. Foxx was especially great when he got to use his comedic skills during the movie theater scene. The closing scene was a little forced but overall a great fun kid friendly movie for the whole family.",Annie
165,lukestrege,Worst movie I have ever seen,1,18 March 2016,"The only reason that I went to this movie was to win a bet with my friends. It was not worth it. The opening scene was so full of me just trying to hide myself from the horror that was this movie. After that it only got worse. The main actress that was in charge of butchering Annie for everyone, did a decent job. Everything else, from the other actors, the music, and script, right down to filming it was all so bad it was unbearable. For a movie to make me want to crawl into a corner and cry for the people who made this, due to the fact that it was so bad that they will not be paid instead they will be hated by every living person on earth, a movie needs to be really bad. That was this movie. There was nothing good about it, I cannot say anything positive about the movie other than when it ends you will feels nothing but relief then a long, long, long period of regret.",Annie
166,iLoveBrcwniies,The sun isn't never coming out again,7,12 June 2020,"Did Sony really think reboot a classic movie about a red-headed orphan was gonna be great? Hell no! After seeing the 1982 and 1999 versions they announced a reboot of Annie and I was like okay! When I went to get it on DVD, I was very disgusted with this film. I am disgusted with the characters (Except Cameron Diaz's role as Miss Hannigan, that guy at the bodega who likes Miss Hannigan, and some minor characters) I had wasted over $5 to buy a dvd of a bad movie reboot.
The plot is about a bratty and spoiled 10-year-old named Annie Bennett (Quvenzhané Wallis of the award winning film Beasts of the Southern Wild; 2012) who lives with other very annoying girls in a foster home ran by the former super star now alcoholic Miss Colleen Hannigan (Cameron Diaz of the mixed to critically panned 2000s Charlie's Angels films, and Shrek; 2001) who is actually likable without the alcoholic issues. This is Mrs Diaz's final role in film before retiring in 2016. After saving a dog from some kids who were randomly added as extras. Annie almost became road kill by William Stacks (Jamie Foxx of the Jamie Foxx Show and Beat Shazam; 2017-?) who they grow a close connection and blah blah blah our title character helps Grace Farrell (Rose Byrne of Two Hands; 1999) fall in love with Will blah blah blah god damn this movie is a nightmare. QUVENZHANÉ CAN'T SING FOR NOTHING. Don't waste your money for the dvd.",Annie
167,Trurl66,"Nice movie about the importance of mobile networking, social media and political campaigning",5,22 December 2014,"I watched 2014 version of Annie with my two daughters last weekend. Both of them liked the original Annie a lot, watched it on Netflix a few times recently, and after seeing a trailer for the new one were looking forward to it.It is not a bad movie overall. A bit slow at the beginning, picking up speed later. I liked the cast, although it would serve the character better if Jamie Foxx could manage to produce any readable facial expression, but I am probably asking for too much. What I really found as odd is how much all the plot is centered around phones, media, social media etc. I am not sure what is target audience for this movie? Are children aged 5 to 10 really that involved with all this? Teenagers - sure. But this movie is not made for teenagers. Well, my daughters, 8 and almost 6 missed this bit (and quite a bit it is!) completely. And believe me they are not different from their peers at school. As for me I found it just annoying. Same (or worse) with the details of political campaigning.Anyway, when I asked my 8 y.o. how she liked the movie, her reply was: ""Awsome! but I liked the one with a red head better"". The younger one, who loves the original Annie a lot was bored through entire movie.",Annie
168,romobley,Enjoyable Family Movie,10,23 December 2014,"This Annie remake was great! I have two small girls who love both renditions of Annie. For me, I actually enjoy this remake a little more because Ms. Hannigan's verses and character is more kid viewer appropriate. My girls are 5 & 6 so I cringe when Carol Burnett says, ""Oochie Coochie,"" in one of her songs. The original will always be a classic. Punjab and Rooster are irreplaceable. But even without them this remake was awesome. The entire Theatre clapped at this performance and I left out with a very proud feeling. The cast was great, but Jamiee Foxx really put a smile on my face. I'm proud of his career and so glad he's able to represent African- American men in a positive light, especially during this time.

169,aaronaviv,"Major Disappointment - Unworthy to be called ""Annie""",3,8 January 2015,"This is the worst remake of a film I have ever experienced. Throughout the film one cannot help but to compare it to the original. Apparently the producers could not afford more than a handful of orphans, servants, or even a car worthy of ""Daddy Warbucks"". Speaking of which... was originally a powerful, competent, educated businessman. And the new character??? What exactly is he? He is afraid of human contact, sells defective products, and couldn't make a business decision to save his life. These are just a few thoughts I had while watching this sad little film. Oh yes, and then there was Annie. The girl which originally, when offered anything she wanted, asked to meet the President of the USA. The new girl??? Not even worth mentioning the comparison (if you can find one). Watch at your own risk.",Annie
170,jsweetwords,Wonderful!,10,30 December 2014,"I LOVED this movie. As a woman that grew up with the comic strip & the musical, I was hesitant about the reboot. Not because Annie & Daddy Warbucks were now black, but just because it was already a classic film. So often, you lose the feel of the plot when trying to update a movie for the times.I feel that this new Annie was able to hold onto the spirit of the character while still updating the lifestyle & nuances of today's reality.I literally laughed out loud so many times and caught a myself tearing up a couple times, too. All in all, I loved this movie. I will own it and I won't need any of my nieces with me to watch it over and over again. This is a feel good movie and touches on a few social points that we all need to remember. Peace & Blessings",Annie
171,colin-598-269859,"Once again, the critics get it wrong. This is a superb film!",10,11 April 2015,"A great deal of prejudice (yes, there really is no other honest word for it) kept me from seeing this movie until recently. Firstly, I only moderately liked the original 1982 Annie, so the thought of remake had little appeal. Secondly, the casting seemed off. Sure, these are great actors worth seeing in any other production, but Annie is pretty defined by her milk-pale skin dotted with freckles, and as-hopelessly-white-as-Bret-Dennen red hair. Not to mention Daddy Warbucks defined the stereotype of a rich white republican businessman. What next? An Irish Nick Fury, a Native American play Bruce Lee in a bio-pic, or Jackie Chan cast as Zorro?Obviously, it seemed, this was a case of art being sacrificed on the altar political correctness, or some other some other nefarious motive. Negative reviews from critics affirmed my doubts, and I felt justified in avoiding this movie. In retrospect: how small of me.When finally seeing this production on Blu-Ray, I was amazed. Quvenzhane and Jamie are fantastic, the supporting cast also put in great performances. The tired 1930's script has been updated to be more realistic and believable. This story draws you in and makes you care. Yes, this feel-good family fare with a predictable happy ending, but it is executed flawlessly. Humor and drama is blended well, and it has the tone of future classic. You will want this in your library, because you will not mind experiencing it again as you show it for others that were also duped by the critics and doubters.Critiques: It would have been nice to hear more of Mr. Foxx's amazing voice talents (we only get a small sample). Producer Will Smith made some good calls in casting (and avoiding another After Earth disaster), but should have done more to distance himself from the film. Maybe to the extent of asking DreamWorks or Disney to distribute under their label, which would have assured greater success at the box office.",Annie

This is the problem with Hollywood these days, destroying perfectly good classics with sheer bone headed dribble.The movie was terrible, the flow of it was all over the place, no proper story build up or background (as for example to why Mr Stacks would in 3 minute space without much convincing even though he did not come across as much of a people person decide to take Annie into his home.)The songs just came out of the blue and were very irritating to listen to.The lead Quvenzhané Wallis although not much to her fault but rather the scripts came across as a really loud and annoying brat.

Good singing, and having watched the first one a few times, there was lots of interesting stuff that was crammed in there that I would not have followed if this was my first Annie.I guess I need a few more lines, so I'll say it could possibly be a tear jerker for some. **Spoiler Alert Coming** I found it quite tragic to see Stacks getting handed those falsified papers and having nothing to say. Also when Annie was told by the fake parents that it was Stacks who set the whole thing up. Those were pretty big parts of the movie for me. The scene with the dog was made so short in this version and then the dog just pops up in Annie's bed and they don't give you any story to it. Also the part at the end with the locket had no lead up at all.",Annie
174,ravgamer333,Little Morphin Annie,2,27 March 2015,"I like Annie. I've seen the musical a few times and both of the previous movie versions. This movie, in comparison, is joyless and unemotional. It's as if the producers were trying to make a live action cartoon instead of a musical. The singing was so marginal that it deflated the entire movie. Maybe they should have considered putting some singers into the cast? Each successive movie seemed to really dumb-down the storyline. This particular version made little sense. I got a kick out of Ms. Hannigan telling Annie she was being transferred to a group home. I just wondered how that would have been different? She already lived in a home with a group of foster kids. The acting was abysmal from all concerned. Again, the exaggerated facial expressions and mannerisms you see from adults when they are talking with a 2 year old was sprinkled throughout. The music was muted and auto-tuned to a point that it approached elevator music. Anyone who thought an new version with a diverse cast would take risks, will be extremely disappointed. This movie is as bland as white bread.",Annie
175,MystieStar,Great movie.,10,20 December 2014,I liked that it was based in modern times and the girl who played Annie did a wonderful job with the character. The musical scenes were great as well. I even had tears at the ending. Very emotional and great movie in all. The movie is about Annie who is a foster child and lives in NYC with 4 other girls and her foster Mom. She is saved by a man who is running for mayor and eventually gets adopted in the end. The story is well done to adapt to modern times and the characters are really good. The girl who plays Annie is a great singer and the whole movie will brighten your day. I would definitely see it again. This could be a new classic in its own right.,Annie

179,yodasoda,Parallel Universe Annie reboot is great fun - ignore bad reviews,10,29 January 2015,"Having read the dreadful reviews and being dragged against my will to see this at the cinema with my pre-teen daughters, I have to admit this version totally won me over.In my grumpy old waspish middle age, comparing this reboot to the original 1982 Annie movie is like trying to compare Wrath of Khan (also 1982) to Into Darkness - they simply inhabit different parallel universes.THIS IS GREAT FUN especially for the pre-teens and families its aimed at. We all felt good coming out of the cinema and the album is on a loop - yes - including MoonQuake Lake.Having watched -and really enjoyed - this Annie reboot, many of the negative reviews in hindsight seemed to have an unpleasant and vindictive quality (perhaps fuelled by the SONY e-hack debacle and other questionable motives) that prompted me to write this positive review.Yes, there is lots here to irritate you if you are a grown-up looking for trouble; the swotty red-head sideswipe in the opening sequence, the likely auto-tuned pitch perfect singing, that Jamie Fox is not a singer (was Albert Finney?), that Cameron Diaz is playing a hammy character... but, hey, GET OVER IT! Of course Annie is a little bit irritating to start with, but she charms and wins Mr Stacks /Warbucks (and us, the audience) over as the film progresses, just as she is meant to.We will be buying the DVD without question.",Annie

This was SO not that! I actually liked this version *better*. The songs were excellent--some were catchy, others actually kind of touching. (I got the soundtrack right after watching the movie.) One song in particular really knocked my socks off, and it's new to this version--but I won't spoil it for you. The 80's version of Annie was far more campy than this one. The ""updating"" was not gratuitous but simply necessary (to keep it relatable to a modern audience). The actress who plays Annie is excellent-- amazingly so for a girl her age.

185,thuytran213,great Reboot for today's kids,8,28 March 2015,"I finally got to watch this with my 4 year old. She's watched the other two Annie films from Disney and the 1987 one. She's watched musicals in the theater too, including into the woods from a local high school with performing arts as a magnet. She absolutely adores musicals, and what kid doesn't?I love that I'm successfully raising my daughter to be color blind, even though I'm finding it harder to shelter her from the prejudistic society that surrounds her. I asked her which Annie she liked better, and she said the curly hair one. We had to clarify the question a bit because 1987 Annie had curly hair too, but she used to love the Disney one best, and that Annie had straight hair. So we asked her this new one or one of the old ones, and she said this Annie. We were pretty proud of her description of the little girl.To those that expected the same exact plot, don't go watch a reboot, watch what you expect to watch, the same old movie, and its OK to hold on to a childhood favorite. Just don't give IMDb users bad reviews based off of nonsense excuses when you just coukdn't get over the racial differences in the casting.When you watch a newly released film interpretation of a Broadway musical, expect change. What's the point of shelling money out to produce the same movie? In my humble opinion, I enjoyed this new plot. I loved the subject of cell phone companies having lots of data on you, so does Google (Google Now scares the living day lights out of me, I feel it knows too much).I loved the fact that they portrayed the issues politicians have with over zealous campaign managers with only the end result in mind, and not a care for the means. For those that hated Cameron diaz, well, she did her job as a character to loathe, and perfectly executed the character building of a washed out lady who had big ambitions without the Talent to actually make it big.I haven't checked IMDb, but was that Dharma from D&G as the social worker.I also loved the message they gave to kids about seizing opportunities as they come, and touched on the subject of how kids in the system, even kids out of the system can fall through the cracks and suffer with illiteracy.So many things I was able to reinforce with this movie for my 4 year old...even the dangers of crossing the street.It didn't even cost me much to watch it. Nobody's making you watch it in the theater; that's why they filmed it, that's why there's redbox everywhere, and that's why redbox have a lot of free rental coupons. I only paid a small little extra for Blu Ray :D. Now my daughter wants to own it. But at least I know she loves it before I buy it. She doesn't want the soundtracks though, she still loves the Disney version's sound track. Her favorite song from that ST is the ""never fully dressed, without a smile"" from Annie friends",Annie
186,silvanafrancesca-32198,Ruined it. stick with original,1,2 February 2020,"Honestly couldn't watch the whole thing but as a huge fan of the original film and the musical they've changed way too much, I know it's a modern version but think they took it to extreme, and the songs changed too much. it doesn't even feel like Annie didn't feel any emotion with it like in the original, cannot beat the original might as well just watch that one.",Annie
187,ldsconvert,"Terrible, awful, painful to watch movie.",1,29 December 2014,"Its not like I am the biggest Annie fan to begin with. My child had less to do with Annie and Pippie Long Stocking, and more to do with playing baseball and football. But now, some years later, and 2 daughters later, I find myself watching the older versions of these movies on television. They are tolerable, and the music in the old version of Annie was pretty good. Unfortunately, this version of Annie was the worst ""re-master"" of any movie or play I have seen. I will start with the good. Cameron Diaz plays a good drunk. Not sure how much acting there really is to be done there. That is it on the good news. The bad news: Quvenzhané Wallis (Annie) – Maybe my kids have been spoiled by the Disney Channel, but no amount of auto tune can fix this girls voice. She can't dance, and is basically held together by the other girls portraying orphans. I don't care that she looks cute, has ""pretty hair"" or matches a demographic stereo type of what we are supposed to think of when we think foster kid. Last I remember she was in 12 Years a Slave. Can't quite remember her role there, but it had to have been better than this. The highlight, well, lets call it the apex of the movie is her soloand it was the hardest 2 minutes of my life. My 5 year old, walked over to me, and asked if we could leave, unfortunately, for the both of us, my 9 year old still wanted to hold on and see if the movie ""got better."" Spoiler alertit did not. Annie in this movie does not know how to read. I recently saw an interview with Wallis on television, and I think it may actually be true. She couldn't read from the queue cards during the interview either. Overall, this untalented little actress, even with all today's technology, can't even portray a homeless girl, who lives with a drunk, and is adopted by a rich business man. Out of the million or so girls that probably tried out for this role, she had to have been the worst. I will say thisshe must have dang good connections in order to win, and destroy a role such as Annie. Jamie Foxx - (who I usually like) portrays a big money business man gunning for mayor. Foxx, previous portrayal of Ray Charles was amazing to me. In Annie however, he apparently would be better off being Ray Charles than Jamie Fox. His voice is auto tuned to high heaven, my two year old has more dance moves than he does, and it is a little hard to portray him as a rich business man taking care of an orphan, when his last great movie had him playing a freed slave who was really good at murdering people.Cameron Diaz - As stated before, she plays a really good drunk, either from experience, or acting skills, she has that part down. Everything else tanks from there. Her voice is the worst of the cast, only slightly behind Quvenzhané Wallis (Annie) Rose Byrne - She has the dance moves I will give her that but very limited singing skills. Why she is in the movie, I am not sure. If only to break up the terrible dialogue between Foxx and Wallis, I guess it's worth it. Content: For a movie directed towards kids, there are a ton of alcoholism jokes. Alcoholism is not a joke. I get that there are a percentage of foster parents out there, working solely for the government check, and I understand that the State may not do a good job placing these poor children . But come on, the movie wants me to believe that the State took a ton of ethnically diverse children of multiple ages, and left them with a drunk anglo women, sulking on her ""what might have been past?"" I don't buy it, neither did my kids.Music: The music throughout the entire movie seems to be auto tuned to the highest levels technology can provide. The writers tried to ""spice it up a bit"" by adding some new songs, but each of them was terrible in its own special way. I feel sorry for any and all of the side actors, or even the extra's who had to sit around for hours, while the cast undoubtedly bellowed and belched out their lyrics. If you are going to make a musical, for heaven sakes, find some musically inclined people, and go from there. The Sun never is going to come out, never again, not ever. Frankly, the sun is too embarrassed by the ghetto'd up version this classic song and the destruction of this classic story.",Annie

189,abhirodrigo,This Remake Is Better Than The Original,10,29 May 2020,"The remake of the 1982 musical Annie, was better than the original. It had more charisma, and the story-line was better - especially the use of backstory on the characters. It helped us viewers engage more with the characters and feel sympathy, hatred, happiness or love towards them. The acting and screenplay was a lot better - its the 21st century now, and Zach Woodlee did a fantastic job with the choreography. Furthermore, the singing was better, and the actors and actresses did an amazing job. I loved this musical so much, I have seen it 3 times!!",Annie
190,bwoodwrites,Best Version of Annie Yet,10,16 August 2021,"I just have to chime in here and say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I didn't think anything could ever top the version with Kathy Bates as Miss Hannigan, but this one was amazing. I really don't know what all the negative reviews are about. Yes, the story line changes a little bit. Yes, there are new and different songs. But they really work.In this version, the characters have more depth, and issues around the foster care system are admitted. It's not got the fairy-tail, long ago, far away feeling of the other versions, because it's set in the here and now. Yet it's triumphant at the end and gives you hope for the future. I absolutely loved it.I guess if you really loved the Carol Burnett version, something like this might seem too tame and too different. But if you have an open mind and would like to see one possible retelling of the story for modern times, I recommend this version of Annie.",Annie

197,Rev_Launch,An Auto Tune Annie for a new Generation.,2,24 February 2015,"This new version of ""Annie"" has all the technological flash of 2014 and a soundtrack straight out of the 90's with the modern twist of auto tune. The little actress that plays Annie is fun, and likable. The entire cast manages to have moments of charm. The movie as a whole never manages to be charming though. That's because any time charm is built up it is savagely beaten over the head by the auto tune and drum machines of the songs.None of the songs are endearing or recognizable to anyone that has seen ""Annie"" before, and to anyone that hasn't seen it before they're probably wondering how Bel-Biv-Devo and En Vogue inspired a musical in 2015. ""Tomorrow"" ,the signature song of Annie until Jay-Z's ghetto anthem made in 1999, sounds terrible. If Quevenzhane Wallis can't sing they should have dubbed her voice instead of using auto tune. I mean it's not like anybody in this movie looked like they were singing anyway. The lip syncing was laughable. The choreography for every song was people walking and looking at the camera. If there was a group around, the main characters sang and the others broke out into random white people dances. There were no big musical numbers until the end, and that was a big let down too. This ""Annie"" was an outdated update that has no character. It ultimately fails because the people making it were too busy making it look modern and flashy. They forgot that music and choreography are what people see musicals for.",Annie
198,Jenelle1975,So glad I never listen to critics...,8,20 December 2014,"... and always form my own opinion. I took my 6 year old niece to see this movie today, and it was a perfect ""feel-good"" family holiday film. The original Annie came out in June of 1982 when I myself was 6, and I remember how much I loved the story and the singing, watching it (and singing along!) quite a few times in my childhood. Well, we sat down together last night to watch the original, and we BOTH had a hard time staying engaged throughout the whole thing. FDR and the New Deal? War bonds? Because the 1982 plot was set in the period of the comic's popularity, not the actual filming date of the movie, there were a lot of references that never did make sense to me growing up. The new movie, set in modern New York City, was relatable for today's kids (criticize all you want, but there are NOT ENOUGH positive non-Disney human characters out there, no matter how much people call it pandering). The script had its share of small flaws, and no one can ever outdo Burnett and Finney, but Wallis was adorable and very likable in the lead role... her personality was believable and not over the top, and oh yeah, she's black, though I don't think my niece noticed.",Annie
199,beamifrend,Someone who has never seen the original,8,28 December 2014,"I took my 9 year old daughter to see this movie, neither of us having seen the original version. From the start we were both hooked on the storyline and the songs. I thought the choreography was excellent in the musical numbers. For the most part the casting was spot on, though i'm still not sure about the Cameron Diaz part. Maybe a better character actor like Kristen Wigg or Melissa McCarthy could have given it more meat. All in all though, we both thought it was excellent entertainment. It never got boring and the story flowed from start to finish. It was clear that Jamie Foxx and the rest of the cast had fun making the movie and that came out in the performances.",Annie
200,willowgarrison-1,Uplifting and worth watching!!,10,19 December 2014,I took my twelve year old to see this tonight and I couldn't have been any more pleased! It's a refreshing modern version of one of my favorite movies and worth taking time to watch. I also appreciate the new renditions of the classic songs as well! Quvenzhane shines in this role and draws you in. I love the modern feel to the movie and I think it makes it more interesting to this generation of kids. It has some sweet moments that will tear you up and moments you will burst out in laughter. It doesn't just appeal to a younger audience but reaches into the hearts of all ages. Just brilliant overall! Can't wait to watch it again.,Annie
201,attygreennorris,A Modern Version Of Annie For A Younger Generation.,10,19 December 2014,"Those that I've seen giving it low ratings are primarily doing so because Annie (2014) does not look like the original Annie and that's saaaaad. Those of us who watched and loved the original Annie (1982) can watch it again and again on Netflix. Annie (2014) is for our children's generation.As soon as my children (especially my daughter) saw the trailer, she was excited about seeing the movie. I tried to get her to watch the original so she would know what this remake is based on, and she did not like the original. She gave it 30 minutes max...but she loved Annie 2014 from beginning to end. THAT is the reason this movie was redone. Whoever watches it needs to go into it ready and excited about seeing the new Annie or else you will have a problem with it.Regarding the plot--Ahhh...the movie is so sweet. It tugged on my heartstrings just like the original. It's not a brand new plot, just a modernized one. Only downside for me was that Wallis didn't have the same strong vocals as Quinn (the previous Annie). Wallis's acting was spot on though. This 2014 version also didn't sing ""Tomorrow"" to death like the first one, but I happened to like the repetitiveness of the song in the original version. This one focused more on Jay Z's version of ""Hard Knocks Life"". Given the modern feel, that worked. Overall, I thought it was absolutely beautiful.I feel like I should thank Will and Jada Smith for having the vision to do this movie, despite all the ""Annie should be white with red hair and freckles"" backlash and recent Sony issues. The casting was perfect. Jamie Foxx stole the show. He's handsome, can sing, and he's funny. Cameron Diaz was perfect too and laugh-out-loud-funny as Ms. Hannigan. Rose Byrne as Grace fit well, and it was good to see the actors I will always know as Adebisi (Oz) and Sgt. Angel Batista (Dexter). I loved the diverse cast.What made me happiest, above seeing a modern version of a classic I loved, is that my 7 year old daughter and I were able to enjoy this one together. Not only do I get to sing ""Tomorrow"" with her, but she got to see a child that looked like her on the big screen in a positive role. My generation didn't have that.",Annie
202,emmamills,Fun Musical & great remake,9,1 January 2015,"My 9 yr old daughter is currently rehearsing for a role in an Annie Am Dram so she was desperate to see the new film. I was worried after all the bad reviews but I honestly don't get it. I prefer this to the original! The music is brilliant, all the characters were perfect (except possibly Cameron Diaz who I thought could have been brilliant but just went to OTT in this). I don't understand the negativity surrounding the portrayal of Twitter/ social networking it made the film relevant and current, and must have taken up about 10mins of the film in total! It's a musical. It's corny and sweet, surely that's what we expect from Annie? So if you don't like that kind of film don't go to see Annie! We thought it was great and all my daughters friends have loved it equally.",Annie
203,animestories-788-229498,Annie 2014...The Modern retelling,7,21 December 2014,"Honestly, I have seen the reviews for Annie recently...and I have to say I'm more disappointed in the critical analysis of this movie than the movie itself. Let me start by saying this much. The movie was well entertaining, with the star of the role as Annie, Quvenzhané Wallis, doing a good job in portraying the charismatic character. In fact, her character is the highlight of the movie, which it should be, considering Annie is the main character. While the other actors/actresses are not necessarily the best fillers for their particular roles, I do feel they fit more with a modern society. Jamie Foxx as Will Stacks (alternative for Daddy Warbucks), and Cameron Diaz as Ms. Hannigan wouldn't have been my first choices for this movie, however, they do a lot better than I was expecting from a children's movie. Cameron Diaz showed the most emotional expression in this movie next to Willis. And considering Daddy Warbucks is supposed to be a contained kind of character, Jamie Foxx really didn't have to do much, anyhow.The bad part about this movie was the musical performances. In my opinion, this movie would have been a lot better without the musical numbers. Don't get me wrong; I LOVE a good musical. But when a movie attempts to make the modern world of cell phones and helicopters into a musical land, it feels awkward. Also, there was truly no effort as far as choreography. Just a bunch of jumping around, which can be very disappointing for people who were hoping to see entertaining dance-and-sing numbers. I'm normally more lenient on musical choreography so long as the song is good...but here the choreography was very messy and ended up taking away from the songs' messages and made the songs feel more annoying than pleasurable. To add, the actors and actresses didn't seem to sing with much emotion. A lot of belching, but none of them really seemed to feel what they were singing. If we opted out all of the musical numbers, this movie would have been an even better family movie for any person to watch. Overall, I still feel this movie will forever be remembered. After all, the 1982 version got really bad reviews when it was first released, yet now its considered a classic. I think that this new Annie will eventually warm people's hearts years to come.",Annie
204,kevin-ward-119-267932,"I hate this musical more than anything, but...",7,25 October 2015,"Annie has always been the musical that I have hated more than any other musical. It holds a special place as the most annoying musical ever written. When I saw they were doing a remake of an already horrible, annoying musical; I cringed. I never would have seen it, if I hadn't been searching for an acceptable film for showing a 3 year old niece and 5 year old nephew. With all of that being said, yes, it is still annoying; however, it was not absolutely horrible. I enjoyed this version better than any other version of the film. I think some of it was because of two of the new songs -- Opportunity and Who am I? Also, this musical made the song Tomorrow palatable. (The most annoying song EVER written.)Most of it was because of the performances of the cast; especially Quevenzhane Wallis (who I absolutely loved in Beasts of the Southern Wild). For those that hated Cameron Diaz, I disagree; I liked her performance. I also felt she found the redeeming qualities of the Miss Hannigan character instead of making her just an overly campy villain with nothing to redeem her. Overall, do I love the film -- no. Do I hate the film -- no. Did I enjoy the film overall -- yes. I felt it was much more realistic than any other version out there and on my next movie night with the niece and nephew, I will play this one for them without feeling I have compromised my principles.",Annie
205,AmoniB,Awesome!,10,3 January 2015,"Excellent movie perfect for adults and children. Annie was casted very well. I was crying, laughing, and dancing all in one sit-in!!! You won't be disappointed if you are actually seeing the movie to enjoy it. Although the script from the original movie is slightly different, as with most Hollywood remakes, It was even better than the original we all love. This one is more modern and using current language and up to date comedy! I didn't know it was going to be all that singing though. They gave it their best. some parts were predictable. laugh out loud like the ENDING song/dance.I highly recommend this film for your enjoyment. Best if you have children or relatives to share the moment with. Please keep an open mind, as if that needs to be said. laugh out loud. the 4 stars seemed to come from people who didn't bother to see the film.",Annie
206,pjwoods07,Wonderful contemporary film adaptation of a classic of stage,10,21 March 2015,"My daughter and I saw this film for the first time over the holidays. We saw several of the holiday blockbusters, and this was by far my daughter's favorite (over the ""Hobbit"" and ""Into the Woods""). I thought it was the best musical and best children-oriented movie of the season. I wasn't sure how they would treat the music, as I grew up with musical theater and with the classics in Annie. I was very positively impressed with how they managed the time difference of the original story (early 20th century Depression era) with the needs of contemporary kids (for the twelve year old set, the 1970s is history, much less the 1920s or 1930s!). They kept most of the classic songs from the musical, and they updated some of them to be appealing to contemporary kids. They added what were to me a few new -- and very appealing -- songs. Instead of using the Broadway ""big sound"" for the music, they kept it more close and intimate, although still plenty big and moving. So, they made use of the film venue to bring you into the music and story more intimately than you can do on stage, where the stage is so far away. It was very effective and produced a wonderful musical and film experience! The performances of Foxx, Wallis, Diaz, Kurtzuba, Akinnuoye-Agbaje, Cannavale, & Zayas were spectacular, all. Now we have the DVD at home so we can see it all the time. They made the story uplifting and fun rather than dark, as it sometimes can be. We highly recommend.",Annie
207,michele-lackner,Was expecting it to be better,2,18 August 2015,I am trying to watch the new version of Annie for the 3rd time this week. The background music is so loud and is getting on my nerves. The singers are terrible especially Rose Byrne which is probably why the background music is so loud - to drown out the singing. Jamie Fox's character is annoying with his germ phobia. Cameron Diaz is a terrible choice for Mrs. Hannigan. I am really disappointed. I really like all of the cast. Annie is cute and Jamie Fox could have really been better portrayed in this. I heard nothing but good things about this movie. Maybe I am watching it with higher hopes that it would have been better.,Annie
208,affiliateintellect,Dreadful version of a lovely musical,2,10 January 2015,"I really wish I hadn't viewed this movie.I took my kids to see it, as we loved the original version and thought this was going to simply be an updated version. There appears to be political agendas in it this time, and that's a pity.But what is truly appalling is the lack of talent in the main cast. Miss Hannigan as originally played by Carol Burnett was funny. Cameron Diaz is just plain nasty.Having now read reviews - that I hadn't before I watched this - I would say the recent ones praising this movie are from the studio. (Noting so many positive reviews are people who have recently joined IMDb: suspicious.)The earlier negative reviews are the correct ones.Stay with the original version of this lovely musical.",Annie
209,MissBodyArt,It's a hard knock life...having to watch this.,4,6 January 2015,"Where to start...I loved the original and really, really, REALLY wanted to like the remake....but I didn't.Taking into account that it is a modern remake and is so obviously aimed at the youth of today, it just disappointed me from the very start. The actors were fantastic, having to step into the shoes of such iconic characters and portray them in a modern way whilst keeping the vibe of the original was done really well. Hats off to all the actors that took on these roles and paid homage to the classic film we all know so well.Having said that, I turned it off after 25 minutes. The lack of depth in this film was agonisingly painful, I kept waiting for that engaging moment, but it never came. I just found myself sitting through it in order to sing the songs. The dialogue was terrible and if the acting wouldn't have been so great then this film would have been a complete failure.Not my cup of tea and I would choose the original over this any day",Annie
210,suzieberry,Loved it!,10,26 August 2015,"Not sure why so many feel the need to bash this version of the movie just because they think they're the top 'original' Annie movie fan of all time. Who cares if they made a new version...it's not even close to being the same as the original. I absolutely loved the original Annie, and I can say that I love this one just as much. It's SO much fun, and all of the actors/actresses are wonderful at acting and singing. I feel that the changes that were made were done so to reflect the times we live in...certain sayings from the original wouldn't be related to as easily. Nothing wrong with liking both...they're just movies, so I don't think you'll hurt the original Annie's feelings if you decide to like this one just as much or more!!",Annie
211,laranroger,Thought it was sweet good family movie,8,10 January 2015,I took my grandkids and it was so nice to see a movie with a positive outcome without bad language or sex or killing. So rare it seems except for maybe Disney movies. I thought the characters did a great job and it was similar to the original Annie but not identical It took place in current day America with Annie as a foster child not an orphan. I think it is easier for children today to identify with and I thought the fact that it was made with black characters provided a positive role model. I thought the little girl that played Annie was adorable and a great example of keeping hope alive in dreary circumstances. Great family movie!,Annie

I took my 5 year old granddaughter and one year old granddaughter and they were dancing in the aisles. Beautiful, touching, funny film. I had to wash the bad taste Frozen left in my mouth out, Annie is that perfect movie.The leads had excellent chemistry, Jaime Fox and Q Wallis were perfect. Cameron Diaz brought the right amount of spunk to her role. The city of New York was the perfect setting, This movie made real life feel like a fairy tale. The songs were perfectly intermingled in a great well thought out story line.",Annie

Comments like ""not sure what audience this movie is made for"" ... well I'm 100% sure that the directors, producers, and writers had 45 year old movie buffs who live at home in Mommy's basement in mind. Shame on you guys for ragging on a movie OBVIOUSLY made for kids to enjoy during the holidays. ""Overacting?"" ""Boring?"" ""Worst movie of the year"" Really? Here's how everyone should rate this movie, take your kids to go see it and let them tell you how ""God Awful"" the writing, acting, singing or however else you Debbie downers want to nit pick this kids movie. Is it the greatest kids movie ever, NO is it the worst movie ever, ABSOLUTELY NO... I enjoyed the movie with my family, specifically when it was meant for my kids to enjoy. That's all that counts. Would this be a movie I'd go and see by myself, no. But after watching, I really enjoyed myself. I tend to prefer really good dramas and this was a really nice change of pace. Well done! Please remember that this movie is a kids movie. Stop talking about race. There was one member here who wanted to point out reverse racism in the opening scene, when in fact that part of the movie was placed there purposefully to let you ""traditionalists"" know that Annie is a name, not a race lol. #IDIOTS",Annie

We have seen all of the Annie movies and have not been impressed by any since the original movie until this 2014 release. We were surprised by this, and expected it to not be even remotely as good. It is actually almost BETTER though. SPOILER Alert: The casting of Molly could have been better, and the ending scene could have been more dramatic, but other than that--it was a big thumbs up! Having an African American as the part of Annie, felt a little different at first, but she was excellent at acting and singing. By the end of the movie, she will win your heart over and you will love her. SPOILER ALERT! They added different songs in the movie and changed a little of the songs, (and we loved them) since Annie is a foster kid not a, orphan. Cameron Diaz was a great actress for Miss. Hannigan , but I prefer the 1982, Carol Burnett.",Annie
216,matt-weatherly,Great movie to take the kids too,10,18 December 2014,"I plan to take my 3 1/2yr old to see it Christmas Day and know it will keep her attention. I watched it because I liked the first one. Yes it was a remake, but don't go see the movie trying to compare it, that just ruins the experience. Go see the movie as a new movie to take the family out together and enjoy.As far as the acting, I saw nothing wrong with it, have you ever seen a grown man try not to cry in front of his kids. I actually know someone who says stuff like ""sand got in my eye"" or ""allergies are bothering me today"", so Jamie Foxx's role in my opinion was good. Same with Cameron Diaz, you were not suppose to like her, she plays the sloppy drunk foster parent that didn't give a darn about the kids. So not sure what peoples issues are... Then other criticism I have seen is that they are black...SO!!??!! I don't see a problem with that either Sony made a choice and went with it, and I think it worked well.I am not a movie critic, or ""movie buff"" I took this movie for what it was, a modernized Annie, meant to be an enjoyable movie for the family.I watched it the first time alone and if asked I would watch it again.I hope this helped someone. I will be enjoying it again on Christmas with the family.",Annie
217,jtorie1978,Awesome Movie,9,5 January 2015,"I enjoyed this movie immensely, and most people in the show that I watched seemed to as well, which proves that the ""critics"" don't know what they're talking about. The real problem they have with this film is that it features a Black lead, unlike the first Annie film. It's not like Annie is a REAL LIVE PERSON: this is a fictional film we're talking about. Kids truly don't care that the ""new"" Annie is a Black girl. But you know what? Critics don't have a problem with movies like Cleopatra and Exodus being portrayed by a White cast members, do they? The only reason why I didn't give this film a 10 is because I would have appreciated more dancing. People, please go see the movie and decide for yourselves. It's good, clean fun!",Annie
218,marleath,Excellent,10,30 December 2014,Awesome movie!!! I never knew Jamie fox could sing like that! Wow! He was amazing!!!That was definitely a very nice surprise!! In all honesty this is the best version of Annie!!!! They stuck to the plot of the old version but gave it a modern twist. I think it was long overdue for a newer version of Annie and this one took the cake!!!! Cameron Diaz was awesome in her role. Everything is perfect!!!!Love love love love love love this movie!!!! Especially loved the science where she sang at the event. As I said Jamie fox did his thing!! He fitted that role perfectly and made it his own. It's one of those movies which will never get old. Will definitely be watching it a couple more times!! Job well done to the producers!!,Annie
219,ladyt1219,Such a great movie!,10,27 December 2014,I am not sure where all of the negative reviews are coming from. This is a modern remake that doesn't need to be compared to the original. This was such an awesome movie. I loved everything about it especially the music. It is not a movie remade for black people. It is a remake for all of our children to enjoy. Quvenzhane Wallis was an absolutely adorable and amazing Annie. I personally find the original Annie very boring. This movie kept my attention the whole time. Cameron Diaz was great in her role and very funny. I think she truly made this role her own. My 6 year old daughter loved this movie and has no interest in the original Annie.,Annie
220,carolinegmorrissey,"Annie 2014, is an updated version of Annie 1982, and both are based on the comic strip Little Orphan Annie",5,23 December 2014,"At the beginning, I was very confused. Besides being called Annie, her caretaker being named Mrs.Hannigan, her rich new dad's overall personality, her dog's name sandy, the rest of the ""foster kids""names, and some of the poorly performed and produced songs, this was nothing like Annie. So pretty much just the names were the same.The directors Foxx and JZ tried way too hard trying to change up the story line while failing to hold onto the personalities of the key characters and song ideas of the 1982 version and the comic strips. Cameron Diaz and Quvenzhané Wallis were the best singers in the movie (and actors). Foxx's performance overall was not the best. At some points of the movie, I was on the fence whether I liked it or not. That is why I gave it the rating I did. Although this movie was full of songs that tried too hard to make you merely grasp recognition of them, some of the other original songs were heartfelt and touching. I am not saying the acting was horrible nor am I purposely dissing any of the actors in this film, but come on guys, what I would give for just one song with no fancy voice editing or changed lyrics, something that will make you say ""oh, I remember this song!"" and not ""huh? was that on purpose?"" I am also not saying that this movie was a waste of time, because it wasn't. This movie was at times really funny, but could bring the faint of heart to tears with the mere transition to another scene. If you have never heard the story of Annie, never seen either of the movie adaptations, you will leave feeling satisfied and smiling to yourself. I, myself, am a true fan of Annie, seeing the movie numerous times, knowing all the songs by heart,and seeing it on stage. It angered me quite a bit at the end with the whole ""Easy street with Mrs.hannigan even though I work for Mr.Stacks"" wasn't really convincing me and I was unsure if it was going to play out the same as it should. So see it and if you didn't like it as much as me, remember, I warned ya!",Annie
221,Cladedah,Don't waste your money,2,8 January 2015,"The sun never came out to shine on this flick. Based on the preview I was looking forward to seeing Annie. Where do I begin to say all that was wrong with this movie. The singing (except Jamie Fox) was awful. The plot was full of uninteresting events. The dancing was pitiful. I almost walked out. I guess I was too optimistic and kept waiting for it to get better. Shame on me. It's too bad that such a great classic was redone in such an uncreative way. Although Sandy the dog was a stray, it was groomed to perfection. That was the only perfection found in this movie. At least I got to enjoy some movie theater popcorn. I'm sure it will appeal to those 12 and under who don't know any better.",Annie
222,analisa_black,Amazing!!,9,31 January 2015,"I absolutely loved this movie to pieces!!! I never ever enjoy remakes of any movie- however, this is a true exception!! I read the reviews on this movie and was for sure it was to be a flop. However, I was completely wrong!! This movie stayed true to most of its original but added in fun new songs but still kept some of the original songs with a fun spin! This is a must see for sure!! i never buy movies- but this one will be bought!! Thank you to the producers for not completely ruining this amazing movie!!",Annie
223,emilymthorpe,Cynical Critics need to see this Movie with Kids,8,19 December 2014,"All the critics out there need to go see this movie with a bunch of 8-13 year old kids. I feel bad for the cast of this film, because I think the reviews are going to stop people from going to see it; We almost didn't go see it, because the reviews were so bad. We talked our kids and their friends into seeing another movie, but then we were late, so we ended up going to see Annie. They all loved it-- boys and girls--and it was so sweet to see them bopping around to the music. It was special for me because this was the first musical I ever saw live in the theater. I was worried that I was going to hate the re-write, but I loved the modern changes they made to make it relevant to a whole new generation. It wasn't perfect and there were a few changes I would've made to dial down the cheese factor a little, but the way the reviews were written it sounded like the worst movie ever: bad singing, bad writing, bad re- writes of the songs, bad acting. Was there something political behind all those awful reviews??? I've sat through a lot more mundane kids' movies through the years with my children that didn't get ripped apart like this movie. I thought the casting was perfect, the singing sounded authentic, the chemistry between the cast was apparent, and the songs were just as catchy as I remember it. At the end, I even had a ""little pollen"" in my eyes, and the audience clapped during the final number. I haven't been in a movie where that has happened in a long time. This movie is for kids and the kid in all of us!",Annie
224,matthewfroggybenntt,I loved this movie! Annie 2014 movie review,8,20 December 2014,"This is my first IMDb review! Well can honestly say I loved this movie. I do not understand what the haters are talking about. Let me be honest with you know I think it's the older people and Broadway purists who hate this movie because it's a version that speaks to a generation that they do not understand. This movie made me laugh, cry, and smile because it was Annie! That's right it was Annie! Ms. Wallis gave us beautiful performance worthy of her Golden Globe nomination. I disliked Cameron Diaz at the beginning of the film because she was really overacting and did not seem comfortable in this role but as the movie progresses her character becomes more human which means she dials down her performance and also I think she became more relaxed in this part after all she is filling big shoes. In the end I liked Ms. Diaz she was nasty and mean at first and then she redeems herself and she becomes human. Ms Diaz also played the part to where you can see this kind hearted woman wants to come out but her bitterness has costumed her. She is also very funny. Diaz did a fine job and I love part where she almost threw up in the helicopter (Carol Burnett is better though). Rose Byrne nails the part of Grace you believe her has this motherly figure who cares for Annie and Jamie Foxx of course is brilliant has always. Wallis and Foxx were the stars of this movie for sure. Bobby Cannavale plays a great villain he was great. Now as far as the story um the story is exactly the same. It is about Annie living with the mean Ms. Hannigan and she wins the heart of a billionaire. She wears half a locket around her neck and the villains use the other half to kidnap Annie and pretend to be her parents for money. It was more politically themed but they were keeping it current with the times and the comic strips were very politically themed as well so there is that. The only difference is there are lots of modern references like to George Clooney, cell phones, Twitter and Facebook and Ms. Hannigan want's to be a famous singer which she used be at the C&C music factory which is something all young people can relate to because being popular is important to people nowadays. It's the same as the original just set in present day instead of the 1930's with references and situations that young people can relate to so other than changing the time period they pretty much copied the original and simply stayed faithfully to it. This is a good thing. Last thing the songs. The songs sound less auto tuned in the movie theater and songs are not that different from the original. The songs are pretty much the same in my opinion just remixed for the young people to enjoy. Great Movie! Take the whole family. If you walk in with a negative mindset you'll hate this movie which what most people have done and older folks remember this version for the current generation to relate to so if you keep all that in mind you'll love it just as much as the original and It will bring back childhood memories. Last but not least Sia did a great job I love her original songs she wrote for the movie. It still has everything from the original and more. Ms. Hannigan still drinks and gets drunk and hates ""Little Girls"". You may see a special red headed girl in this movie as well and Great Job to those who worked so hard to make this movie! I give this remake 8/10.",Annie
225,Avalontravel,Must See(Again!),10,21 December 2014,"Annie was a beautifully entertaining film about a fostered girl in modern day America whose big dream is to one day meet her biological parents. She faithfully awaits their return as she encounters one cunningly opportunistic adult after another. The film's messages are so simple and cliché in the Western world as to not worth arguing about(that's a good thing): The love of family(biological and chosen) is more important than material gain. Lonely people are still lonely at the top. Everybody needs love. Greed leads to evil. It's a children's movie for Pete's sake!My toddler and middle-schooler-both boys-were hooked from start to finish, but so were my husband and I! The music was catchy and upbeat. Quvenzhane Wallis was a bright shining star and was such a joy to watch. She really was a heart warmer and a convincingly hopeful foster child. In fact, the entire cast was charming, including Carmen Diaz. Many of the ratings here were questionable until further reading. How does a movie get so utterly slammed before it's even come out? Go home boot leggers! Complaints about Quvenzhane Wallis not being the ""real"" Annie abound. I've seen the word n**ger tossed about and believe those bitter sentiments are the source of the majority of the negative ""audience"" reviews. Critics missed the entire point of this film and can safely be ignored.We live in an upscale part of Boca. It's predominantly white, as was the viewing audience. I'd read the reviews prior to seeing the movie and intentionally watched the audience to see their reactions. I mean, if a movie is a 2-star overall, it should reflect that in a random audience, right? People should be disappointed and bored! But no. Adults and children alike, black, white, Hispanic, and some Asians, were all tuned in and appeared joyfully entertained throughout. A group home for teens with Down's Syndrome were seated in front of us. One of the young men was so excited for Annie that he was standing up and cheering for her along the way. We all were. A middle aged white mother with her two blond haired daughters was seated next to my eldest son, ""This is so great, isn't it?"", she asked enthusiastically at the movie's halfway point. My son beamed and told her he loved it. Annie received a sustained applause at the end and I knew it would. The audience had fallen in love with her journey and with her. Annie is cheesy, simplistic, clichéd, redundant, auto-tuned, and almost a full 2-hours long. It's also whimsical, joyfully entertaining, heartwarming, packed with talented performances, groundbreaking in its characterization of Annie as a little black girl, and supports messages about family and love that are virtually inarguable. In other words, it's an excellent holiday film!Ignore the ratings slam that the movie is receiving, many of of which are from people who are quite obviously racist and others subtly so, and see for yourself. Oh, and if you loved it, please rate it.",Annie
226,ayhicks78,Pleasingly Surprised....Thanks for the negative reviews,10,21 December 2014,"I was a bit skeptical after reading negative reviews of the film, but my 4 year old still insisted we go. I am ever so glad we did. In fact, we are scheduled to see the film a second time tonight with my niece.Here is my honest review.If you hated the original Annie or if you don't care for musicals, then this may not the movie for you. As a person who was a huge fan of the 1982 version of Annie, I was so afraid that the film would overly mimic the original. Instead, the film was not, as critics claimed, a ""black rendition""; It is a 2014 remake containing a multi-racial cast, with an African American lead actress.The 11 year old Quvenzhane Wallis was just as spunky and memorable as Aileen Quinn was when she played in the 1982 version. Cameron Diaz is not Carol Burnett, so those who compare the two are not being fair to Cameron. Instead, I was surprisingly impressed by Ms. Diaz. She embodied the original role, while making it her own.Every actress/actor, song choice, story line, etc. gave fans of the original a taste of the old, while presenting the timeless Rags to Riches story of Annie to a new generation.I truly enjoyed this film. I am thankful for the negative reviews, because my expectations going into the theater were so low. I wasn't the only person who enjoyed the film. The sold out theater, burst into clapping immediately after the show was over. I heard one woman say ""It was like seeing a movie and being at a play at the same time"". She could not have described the moment any better.Great Movie!",Annie
227,alyssa1978,Enjoyable,8,21 December 2014,"Having been a fan of the original Annie movie (1982), I decided to go into this movie with few expectations, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I watched this movie with my mom and 13 year old daughter, and we all three enjoyed this remake. I think Jamie Foxx did a great job, and his singing voice is gorgeous. I thought Cameron Diaz was not the greatest choice to play Miss Hannigan. Carol Burnett played that character so well in the 1982 movie; however I eventually warmed up to the Diaz Miss Hannigan. I was a little disappointed with the way over-produced music, but there were a few new songs that were pretty good. Overall, if you go into this movie not expecting it to be a remake faithful to the original movie or play, and simply enjoy the story for what it is, you won't be disappointed.",Annie
228,skky-191-212628,This is a must see film!,10,21 December 2014,"My family and I really enjoyed the movie last night, and I just downloaded the soundtrack on iTunes this afternoon.So far, all of the negative comments are related to the race of the characters. That is sad in 2014.All of you who commented negatively, prior to the official release of the film, should delete your comment, go to the theater, watch the film, and then re-write your commentary.If you watched a BOOTLEG version, you haven't captured the full essence of the film. If you're basing your comment on the DWTS performance, then you have limited information.Ignorance is highly contagious...stop spreading it.This was a great family film. I enjoyed the music, the acting, and the humor.",Annie
229,sdespain-192-357102,wonderful will buy also on DD,10,21 December 2014,This movie was amazing . Each and every actor was incredible as were the actresses. I have a granddaughter that was adopted and unless you have been through the foster system or know someone who has you could never really relate until you seen this movie. It is more real than than you know. Children forgotten everywhere. This movie made us laugh...cry....think.... giggle and sing. From the ages of my granddaughters 3 and 6 to myself and my 73 year old mother. It is a must go see. Very well re created. I would like to say I have seen a few bad reviews. I cannot fathom why. There wasn't a bad segment in this movie. I think that when you see it. It will draw you in break your heart and finally at the end bring unexpected happiness.,Annie
230,sjm27,Family movie re imagined,10,21 December 2014,"I created an account today because of all the bad reviews.I'm sorry if you're upset that Annie doesn't have red curly hair but the movie has been made. Get over yourself.I took my seven year old niece and she loved it.It's crazy to me all the controversy being created by adults when this is a kid's movie. These young children don't care what color her hair is so why should you? Anyways I enjoyed it, it was a cheesy family movie.I love the 1999 version but this one is good too.Take a chance. Ignore the other reviews. Enjoy your holidays.",Annie
231,christyleicht,Excellent movie to share with today's kids,10,22 December 2014,"I am glad I didn't hear the negative reviews. Went with my 8year old who likes the original but could relate to this one so much more! This one will be for her what the old one was for our generation. I appreciated the funny references to the Original without being a complete copycat. I think it was about two songs too long but overall they did a great job at paying homage to a classic while bringing it to kids today. The theater was full of folks who clapped at the end and at various other parts of the movie. Wallis was love able and funny and the whole cast really fit their parts. Overall, great job. We loved it and will be watching it again!",Annie
232,brown-joness,A great must-see family movie that will have you feeling good at the end of the movie.,10,22 December 2014,"I took my grand children, and we all really enjoyed 11 year old Quvenzhane Wallis as Annie. We talked about the movie all the way home. The entire cast was great! I was skeptical at first, but I was really surprised, and truly enjoyed the movie. This multi-racial version is every bit as good as the 1982 version. I enjoyed how Jamie Foxx as Will Stacks easily fit into his role as a least-likely mayoral candidate, and made it believable. Cameron Diaz took total control of her role as the foster care mother, Hannigan that. Bobby Cannavale as Stacks campaign manager, Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, as Stack's drive, David Zayas as Lou, and the rest of the amazing supporting cast really owned their roles. This is a must-see family movie with a great twist in the ending.",Annie
233,ellielouisej,Boring,1,22 December 2014,"I thought this film was so rubbish and of course it's not going to be like the original Annie I understand that but it was so boring I couldn't wait to leave the cinema. There wasn't much of a proper story line to the film. It just looked like a budget, quick skim through of the original. The songs were song after one another but there was no real story line in between. I seriously wouldn't recommend wasting your money to watch this film it's not worth it. I love the film Annie and this one was a shambles. Maybe little children might enjoy it but it just dragged on. The acting was quite poor as well. It all looked very staged.",Annie
234,khadevisr,Great Movie ( Do not listen to the Critic),8,22 December 2014,"This Movie is good. Ask any Kid that went with their Family. Most people are upset that Annie was Black and not what they are used to. Everyone I know that saw the movie liked it. I think it is important to go with kids because they get that it is a fun movie and not a Drama. WHen you read the reviews make sure you see what they actually say about the movie and not about how it was different from the original. It was a nice, fun, family movie. Thats the key, it's a family movie. Please, go see it for yourself. Some people just don't like the Casting, not because the actors were bad, but because the actors were not what they wanted. If you are a teacher or a parent that has kids that have diverse friends and if they went to go see it, I guarantee the majority of them liked it. As a matter of fact, when you read the reviews you will find a trend and pattern of the people that liked it and the people that didn't like it. The one's that liked it say it was a good kid movie and a family fun movie. The people that liked it never brought up Race at all. Jamie Foxx was good, the little girl was good. Most of the singing was good, though some could have been better but we know Cameron Diaz is more of an actress and not a singer but Jamie Foxx can sing. Take your kids, your niece, nephew, cousin or a friend. You will come away and say what everyone else is saying and that is that the movie was good even though it got these bad reviews. Just go see it for yourself and you will come here and write reviews to counter those negative ones.",Annie
235,line-swagg2000,It wasn't horrible but it wasn't great either,6,23 December 2014,"I don't understand all the hate on Annie's new skin color. Annie's supposed to adapt to every generation's (or area's) expectation of ""poor"" and prejudice. Did you know that Marvel's Nick Fury is actually originally white ? Nope. You did not. However, I didn't like the movie completely because of Cameron Diaz' acting in this movie (god damn she was a pain in the ass) Also, the music was alright, it just had a weird sound that I didn't quite like. It was obvious that the actors are not singers. The chemistry between Annie and Will was adorable nevertheless. Quvenzhané Wallis is a very talented, adorable and charismatic actress. It's really refreshing to see a good child actor. I adore the original and I do like the concept of the remake. It's an interesting take on the original (with really upbeat music). It could've been better if the acting wasn't as awkward or stiff at some moments or if they didn't force it to be ""hip"" and ""modern"" but other than that it's not a horrible movie. It's very mediocre. Thank you for your attention.",Annie
236,nicktraynor-193-927640,Post-Production Annie misses the mark,4,3 January 2015,"It was a real shame that the songs were all lip-synced by the actors. I felt that it detracted enormously from the viewer's ability to emotionally engage with the characters. The effect was somewhat like taking a bite of not-bacon and expecting bacon.Cameron Diaz was hopelessly miscast as Miss Hannigan. In no way was her performance gritty or authentic enough to be believable.That said, I was wholly supportive of the social agenda of the film; that is, to recast the story with African-American characters. There were some genuinely funny moments also. I just think it wasn't executed as well as it could have been.",Annie

I have to write because my wife and I saw ""Annie"" last night at the Marcus in Addison, IL (lovely theater by the way).The so-called reviews for this movie are a bunch of C R A P! We loved it; I was nearly in tears (I said ""nearly""). This is a wonderful holiday movie for the whole family; and I'm not just saying this due to a black-led cast; I've called plenty of black films bullsh*t, and many of my favorite films consist of an all white cast. I plan on going back with the grand kids.Lord knows I'm neither racist nor racially sensitive (as I notice many black people to be), but who the h*ll is writing these reviews about a fun-loving kids flick; what's their agenda???You should have seen the kids last night (a mostly white audience I might add) jumping and dancing to the music: Oh you should have seen them when ""It's a hard knock life"" came on; I sung and danced with them. If you have kids, grand kids, or simply a kid at heart; do yourself a favor and go see this movie this holiday season, and while you're at it have yourself some popcorn, a Coke, and a smile.",Annie

Considering myself a movie goer of sophisticated tastes, watching a musical and a kid's movie to boot was not my idea of a satisfying Christmas eve. I went with my brother at his insistence, feeling benevolent because of the season. We are both pretty long in the tooth. I was utterly surprised. I had no prior history with this well seasoned product before today and loved this presentation. Cameron Diaz is the thief of the movie in my opinion. She is flat out hysterical! Honestly, I was sitting in the theater thinking of the number of people I would text to check this movie out.

I wanted to do something special with my 16 year old grand daughter for Christmas eve and she wanted to see Annie. Hadn't realized that the Smith's and Jay Z was tied to it until we got there. I was so pleased and warmed by the movie that I came home to look at the reviews and WOW...I am saddened by what the ""professionals"" are saying. I am glad I saw it before reading the reviews!! I enjoyed it I enjoyed every character, every song, the energy between the actors and young Quvenzhané Wallis did a believable and excellent job as the New Annie!!!! This was not a 1930's version of the character but a millennium version and a Good one. I see the issue and it is an issue that America has had for a long time and no matter how you try there is a number of Black millionaires and a couple of billionaires; so brace your selves for the changing landscape and most importantly Black folk support these types of changes and is a trillion dollar business!! Thanks Jay Z, Jada and Will Smith for pooling your resources and bringing to the big screen a film that I could and did enjoy with my precious gem!! Looking forward to the next one!!",Annie
240,music210310,A feel BAD Movie,1,7 January 2016,"I have watched ""Annie"" on Broadway several times over the years in different cities. I own the 1982 movie of ""Annie"" with Aileen Quinn, Albert Finney, and Carol Burnett. I have even watched many high schools put on their idea of ""Annie"" as well. I can honestly say this is the worst ""Annie"" I have ever seen. The acting is so bad. I can not believe they managed to get some of the big names from Hollywood to agree to be in this movie. The old songs mixed with the new hip hop songs just do not go together. The sing is beyond horrible. I am a classical musician and I have never heard a ""musical"" sound so off key as this one. Five minutes into the movie, I prayed it would get better. It did not. Buy the 1982 movie of ""Annie"", it is so much better. This is not a remake of ""Annie"". I can respect anyone who wants to update an old classic, but that is not what they did. They would have been better off getting rid of the ""Annie"" title and not try to sell it as a remake.",Annie

We've watched several versions of the movie (1982 awesome, the 1995 ""A Royal Adventure"" not so awesome) and this 2014 version is definitely a modern adaptation of the story. My daughter is now 9 and she can relate to the modern changes (social media, hip versions of the classic Annie songs) so she truly enjoyed the movie. After reading so many negative reviews I was not sure I would enjoy it but I LOVED it. Don't go to this movie expecting a replica of the 1982 movie. This is completely different but still very entertaining.",Annie
243,sherellbl,Awesome Remake!,10,28 December 2014,"I loved Annie as a child and really enjoyed taking my 10-year old to see this remake! It was really cute and my daughter has been asking to see it again. My Sister and son also went and we all liked it. Very nice updates to bring this old classic into the present! I really don't understand why there are so many negative reviews. The theater that we went to was surprisingly packed, and the audience clapped at the end. I cannot wait to add this 3rd Annie to our DVD collection. I will probably pickup the music CD this week since we already bought some of the books. Please go and support this movie. I rarely like musicals but somehow love Annie!",Annie
244,tannholley,We adore this modern upgrade to a beloved classic.,10,28 December 2014,"My 5 year old and I have seen this movie three times now, with three different groups of children. I loved the original Annie and was slightly skeptical of any remake attempt. Also, understanding how hard it is for some to progress past their own biases and possible prejudices, I wondered how a black Annie would be perceived. I must say that the writers, producers and actors did an amazing job retelling this classic. There is zero focus on skin color within this story, which makes it perfect for people of all ethnic backgrounds to enjoy. This is a perfect family movie in which everyone we have attended showings with, have given a high rating. I am amazed that anyone would think a remake should look exactly like the original, which was released in 1982. We all have the right to have varied opinions of this movie. That being said, I think some negative reviews have been written by individuals stuck in the year 82 or quite a few before.",Annie
245,amycastle92,"Great family fun! Let's not be miserable, people!",10,30 December 2014,"I just want to start with saying that plenty of the comments were made by people who do not like the original 'Annie' or musical in general. Why would you then go and watch the movie, expecting to hate it? Also, if seeing a black Annie bothers you so much then move to a remote island with a mirror so all that you see if yourself, you miserable racists. The movie was fantastic family fun with a modern twist. Thank God that there is an Annie that other little girls can relate to. The songs were lovely and it left a lovely warm feeling inside. Please, I beg people to stop being so bitter! Definitely worth taking your children to go and watch!",Annie
246,Mail1227,Terrible Remake,1,30 December 2014,"Took the kids to see the movie with anticipation that it would be good. After we began watching it was easy to tell within the first 10 minutes it was totally out of character and was falling short of what I hoped would be a good attempt at a remake. About 3/4 way through the kids were getting restless and just not getting into the movie at all, and they loved the original Annie, and have probably watched it 30 times over the last couple years. In my opinion you just cant beat the original, and its definitely out of character, the cast plays their parts in a way that actually destroys the movie. all and all one word, Boring and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone! Want a good Annie watch the original or the 80s remake!!!",Annie

Watch the movie to find out,8,30 December 2014,This movie was excellent. Before I watched the movie many reviews said it wasn't good. However it put a little twist on Annie and it kept me entertained. The songs were the same from the original one but they added some and they were sang differently. Overall the music was great. Very good story line and the acting was excellent. After seeing the movie I was very surprised the reviews said what they said. There were many parts that were funny and my children were even laughing. They enjoyed it and it was worth every nickel. The movie made you feel like you were in the movie experiencing it. The people who said it was bad most have seen the wrong movie because this movie was great. I would have not changed the movie in any way. There might be more bad reviews but Im telling you it's going to be worth your money. You would be missing out if you didn't see it. It was fantastic and I could watch it again. My oldest child even got the album. It was a great movie and you should watch it .,Annie
248,klbussiness,Great Family Movie & Pleasant Surprise,9,31 December 2014,"My sister and I were pleasantly surprised with this movie production. We took our teenage daughters to see the movie because their friends enjoyed it so much. The movie was fun, filled with humor, and really appealed to all age groups. The chemistry between Mr. Stacks and Annie were spot on. Not only were both of them good singers, the movie did a great job developing their relationship. Considering the obstacles the studio had to face (revising the script to make it current, without taking away the essence of the original play). I believe they did a superb job. Some of the parts had me laughing and nearly crying. There are not too many movies that affect me that way. The jokes were perfect for the 35+ crowd, teens, and little ones. We all left the movie feeling a little ""lighter"" with a smile on our faces. The critics need to lighten up a little, I did not see one person leave the movie without a smile on their face. Kids are pretty easy to please, but you know it is a good movie when you see some of the parents tempted to dance out of the movie theater.",Annie
249,rtanweb,One of the worst re-makes to ever come out from Hollywood,1,31 December 2014,"Having previously watched the original (and the best) Annie, as well as a number of musical versions of this great story i was very disappointed by the new film. Poorly acted, badly written and moronically directed - it is extremely dull!The main problems are caused by unimaginative and basically amateur directing skills of Will Gluck. A very inexperienced movie maker, whom to-date has never made a single truly successful show. In my opinion producers hired this gentleman because he is cheap. Will Gluck simply had to copy a successful formula. He failed. And so does the new Annie.Conclusion: AVOID LIKE HELL!",Annie
250,damesd,Fun for the whole family,8,31 December 2014,"Not sure what is behind the negative comments but glad I didn't listen. Took my 2 kids along with my niece and nephew to see this. The two boys in my group originally were not interested in seeing this but at the end they had to admit that they really enjoyed it. I even thought the movie was quite enjoyable. I thought Cameron Diaz did a good job in the role of Ms Hannigan, but I personally liked the performance of Carol Burnett in the 1982 version the most. I thought this version was modified just enough to stay true to the original but add something fresh and new. Bottom line is if you are looking for an entertaining family film. Look no further. Definitely an enjoyable movie for the kids.",Annie
251,elizabeth-201-756728,No Comparison to Original,2,4 March 2015,"I was so looking forward to seeing this movie but I was thoroughly disappointed. The voices were not strong, thus they had to rely too much on the music to carry the voices(the sining). The music was much louder than it should have been compared to the singing levels. Several actors voices were dubbed for songs & All voices were auto-tuned. They had NO dance talent and the acting was awful. The original movie did not need to have good acting because they had all of the other talents that this movie does not have. I like the actors in the movie, just not in THIS movie. I would not suggest this movie to anyone - giving this movie 2 of 10 was stretching it.",Annie
252,danievermore,Ignorant Critics -Excellent and Appropriate Remake,10,3 January 2015,"I have no doubt that the many people rating down this movie are either racists or people who don't understand the meaning of remakes.This film, a modern remake of the 1982 classic is rather delightful, the beginning sequence pulled me in immediately and the first classroom scene where ironically a class member with ginger hair, freckles and a red cardigan is giving a presentation before our modern Annie is called up to do hers is hilarious and clever in itself. Also seeing Annie's journey to the restaurant really highlighted the modernness of this film. It's set in 2014. Not the depression.The modern remakes of the songs are both fun and energetic though i do miss the orchestra feel of the 1982 film. Quvenzhane Wallis (Annie) is very talented and despite the unnecessary auto tune here and there, pulls off Annie amazingly, her take on Sia's Opportunity gave me goose bumps. This film is filled with hilarious fresh one liners especially from Jamie Foxx, who plays the modern and very accurate version of Mr Warbucks.This film will surely make you laugh, the only downside i have is the fact that they could have done a LOT more Choreographically, for example the choreography in the original hard knock life was astounding whereas this version not so much. I also found one or two of the random song break made me cringe. But the major downfall was the choreography and the fact their are only 5 foster kids, these things are the reason i can't give the film a 10/10.This is NOT Political correctness, most people fail to realize that 1982 Annie based off a fictional cartoon strip, was set during the great Depression and a time where Irish and Ginger folk, two of Annie's attributes were highly marginalized and carried negative stigma, that's what made Annie special. The fact that she made people see through all of that and love her for the sweet adventurous child she was despite her social class. This modern reboot portrays Annie as a black girl another marginalized group, if you don't believe me, look at all the racist reviews. Annie could be any child, Black, White, Asian, but the fact she was a ginger opened a lot of eyes and hopefully this film will too.PS. I took my kids who have seen the original to watch this and they loved it, no mention of race, no mention of Annie's hair, so you grown adults complaining do look pathetic.All in All, GO SEE THIS FILM! And if you like it, write a review.",Annie
253,shironda-white,LOVED This Movie,10,3 January 2015,"I loved this re-make of Annie. It was definitely made with the younger generation in mind, but those of us who aren't so stuck on it not being like the original (although the original was definitely one of my favorite movies of all time) will appreciate it as well. First, let me get the obvious out of the way - Cameron Diaz's character was horrible. And I mean horrible in a ""who's idea was it to cast her?!?!"" kind of way. She overacted and was just overall a bad fit for this character. But Quvenzhane Wallis, Jamie Foxx, and Rose Byrne were amazing. They owned their characters and seemed to do it so effortlessly. This movie is set in modern-day New York, and it's definitely a 2014 version of Annie, with all of the modern technology that entails. I don't know that it will become a classic as the original Annie did, but it's definitely a movie to watch.",Annie
254,damiobdhs,Best movie i've seen so far in 2015,10,4 January 2015,"Wow, all the one star reviews are so sad. Im really glad i didn't listen to them and took my kids to see the movie. It is such an amazing movie and i don't think there was a single person in the theater who didn't walk out with smiles on their face. Honestly, i prefer this version to the 1982 version and Quevenzhane is an amazing singer and performer. She's also a good role model for little girls to look up to. The people saying that she can't sing or dance are being so unfair and that makes me sick to my stomach! I normally never leave movie reviews but will be rating this a 10 star review to hopefully offset the jackasses picking on a beautiful talented little girl.",Annie
255,user-204-360864,Best Musical Reminder,10,4 January 2015,I've read a lot of the negative reviews about Annie saying everything from it's a lot of music to not liking Cameron Diaz to not liking the ethnic Annie. I will say that I've seen the original Annie and all other versions and it does what all the others do...THEY SING A LOT! It is for goodness sakes...a musical! I would be very upset if I went to an opera where they talked! I like the additions and the things that they've added to the new Annie to make it match modern times. I also really enjoyed Cameron and Jamie Foxx's performances. They were good and refreshing. I loved the new Annie...not only was she cute as a button but her performance was great! Don't listen to critics...go see the new Annie.,Annie
256,piedraloca,Excellent update to the original film.,9,5 January 2015,"Don't listen to the haters (who I suspect largely consist of people who dislike musicals). Quvenzhane Wallis was the perfect choice for the role of Annie: she captures the cheerful pluck of the original Annie without seeming cheesy - no small feat! Her performance really shines. Cameron Diaz is a bit over-the-top as Miss Hannigan, but her updated rendition of ""Little Girls"" was well done. There were plenty of laugh-out-loud parts for both kids and adults, and the singing was interspersed well with regular dialogue. It did bother me that the music sounded incredibly over-produced at times.The original Annie was an Irish-American girl at a time when prejudice against the Irish was quite active, so the choice to cast an African-American actress in the role captures the spirit of the original perfectly. As for people who want there to be more class analysis - the original was a rags-to-riches fantasy and this follows in its footsteps. If you want an analysis of income inequality, consider seeing a different film.",Annie
257,Derk814151977-205-405745,Surprisingly very funny and entertaining,9,12 February 2015,"This is a classic case when a marketing team damage a film. From seeing all the trailers I thought this film was going to be terrible. But after watching this I was shocked how funny and entertaining this film was. Kids and adults will love this film. My only major criticism is some of the new songs are a bit hit and miss and auto tune can be heard a little too often. Beyond some of the stars not having great singing voices and one or two meh songs, it was very good fun film.I watched the Lego Movie and I think this film is a far more funny and entertaining and rewatchable film. This is a rare case of an old classic that has been updated and it really works. There are going to be people out there who will hate this film just because they remade it, but I say give it a chance because it is very good.PS. I would sack the guy who did the marketing of this film. For this film to have so many funny lines and moments and not be able to show that in the trailers shows this guy failed. My niece loves it and has already seen it 3 times and is still laughing and singing along.",Annie
258,i-healey2430,Surprisingly good,9,8 January 2015,"I had heard a lot of bad reviews about this version of Annie and let me say this is a version of Annie. If you love the musical, like really love it you may be upset over the interpretations of the songs for this film and I will admit Cameron Diaz is not the best singer.However I loved the film. I especially like that they showed the relationship between Annie and Mr Stack grow. (Unlike the 1982 film) The actors were terrific, and at the end all I wanted to do was sing and dance my way out.Some people just may not like this film. It just might be too different for some people but if they give it a chance, you might find something special about this film.Annie (2014) is not perfect; some of the plot doesn't make sense. The illiteracy and then she reads the forms and notes but it is a fun family film that deserves a chance",Annie
259,myjunkmail-210-944464,Cute Movie,6,11 January 2015,"I think this was a cute movie. I have seen a lot of complaints about the new Annie using an African American kid, and well quite frankly, I see nothing wrong with that.The little girl that played Annie did a wonderful job;however, I am not a fan of Jamie fox as he is a mediocre actor at best.Although I thought the movie was cute and the story was good, I think Hollywood could have done a way better job of the whole production of the movie. To me the movie seemed to end quickly but it was still cute. I was not a fan of the ending though, the last couple of minutes.This is a cute story.That's all I have to say",Annie
260,newmoonjess07,worse musical movie,1,16 January 2015,"Horrible acting, story line was not interesting at all I was thinking okay when is this going to get good???singing was horrible as well, etc... One of the worse musical movies I have seen, none of these actors are good at singing and maybe Jamie Fox is the only one that sounds okay. I will never watch this movie again and Cameron Diaz role is extremely annoying...Very disappointed with the entire movie!!!! I guess my expectations were a bit too high and how did this movie receive awards??? no idea!!! My husband did not like it and my little cousins did NOT like it either. Please make a better musical movie maybe using different actors that can actually sing and act good.",Annie
261,msetm1966,Very Enjoyable!,10,5 February 2015,"I didn't know what to expect with this version of Annie, but I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed every moment of the movie. I laughed, cried and even tried to get down some of the dance moves. I've seen it probably about 5 or six times, I keep finding different people who haven't seen it, to go see it with me lol. I can't wait until it comes out on DVD, so I can go buy it and watch it everyday. It's so uplifting and always puts me in good spirit when I watch it. Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of the older version of Annie, but I loved this one even more. There are a few differences between the two, but mostly its an excellent remake.",Annie
262,rachelmdoherty-233-982632,Great Family Film that adults as well as kids will enjoy,9,7 February 2015,"I enjoyed the twist at the beginning where the first child up was a red-head but actually Annie was a different kid. Nice way of letting us know that there would be homage to the old story, but also changes.Anne herself(Quvenzhané Wallis) was incredibly talented and while Cameron Diaz will never make it as a singer, she got better as the film went on. I think they probably expanded her role more than they should have, just because she is so famous. I thought Rose Byrne was great though it was a little clichéd how her hair went from straight to wavy to signify loosening up. She didn't need it. She was the warmth in the film.Overall it was a great film, my heart strings were pulled at the lines 'no one cares if you shrink or grow', the fact that Annie couldn't read and no one cared enough to spot it and I thought the chase scene at the end was clever.The kids loved it and so did both parents.",Annie
263,wilcziek-malia,New and Not-So Improved,4,19 February 2015,"The 2014 Annie is a modernized remake of the 1982 Annie that we all know today. The film has a fairly similar plot, but has some added depth. Annie, played by Quvenzhane Wallis, a young African-American actress, rather than an orphanage, she lives in a foster home with Miss Hannigan played by Cameron Diaz. The bad acting and forced musical numbers outweigh the good of this film causing it not to live up to its expectations. Diaz's acting in this film is good at some points, while atrocious at others. Miss Hannigan is supposed to be a drunk only fostering these children for the checks she gets from the state. The first time we meet Miss Hannigan in the movie, she is supposed to be very drunk. Diaz acting drunk resembles that of what a child would act like if they were pretending to be drunk. It was just too much. However, there are times throughout the movie where she is the normal Diaz that can actually act and doesn't go over-the-top. Another main character is Mr. Stacks, played by Jamie Foxx, who is portraying Daddy Warbucks. His character is running for mayor and looking for ways to boost his votes. After saving Annie from being hit by a car, he takes her in as way to get more votes. They develop a relationship and eventually they find themselves caring for each other, as expected. The audience can feel how much Stacks cares for Annie when he realizes she has to leave, which is a scene that made the connection they developed seem very genuine.It's an Annie remake, so, of course there are plenty of musical numbers. I enjoyed the modernized classic Annie songs with a hip-hop twist, but thought the random musical numbers seemed forced in the movie. There is one scene where Stacks and Annie are in a helicopter and Jamie Foxx ruins a memorable scene by singing a very cheesy song that just felt random and out of place. The script was written very well and added depth with new things added to make it new and a bit humorous. Annie goes to a restaurant every Friday and waits to see if her parents will arrive because that is where they left her. It is obvious she has been doing this a long time and is dedicated to finding her parents because of her relationship with the restaurants owner. Secondly, Annie cannot read. In the beginning of the movie, she asks a social services worker to read a paper to her about her parents claiming that she is ""too nervous."" Later on in the movie, we find out that Annie is actually illiterate. This opens the viewer's eyes to the issues that are still happening in America. Annie lives in poverty and as a result of this, her lack of education has failed her. Overall, I prefer the original Annie. It had a more realistic feel, whereas this seems like it is being performed in a theater with the over-the-top acting and musical numbers. Although the acting coming from Quvenzhane Wallis and Jamie Foxx is fairly commendable most of the time, the acting from the rest of the cast brings it down. Also, the nonstop singing makes the movie seem childish. Again, the film simply didn't live up to my expectations for a remake of such a classical movie due to the forced musical numbers and over-the-top acting.",Annie
264,katelynnance,Modern twist to a classic,6,27 February 2015,"I loved this movie! Growing up Annie was one of my favorite movies so I was hesitant to go see a remake of a classic. I loved the modern twist to the new Annie and the setting being in New York added a busy lifestyle to the plot. It allows kids today to be able to better relate to the experience Annie and her friends go through. Will Stacks was a perfect modern Mr. Warbucks. He is consumed by his busy life and technology just like many Americans today and would go to extreme measures to reach the next level in his career. Annie and Mr. Stacks form a unique, loving and caring relationship that helps Mr. Stacks become a better man. Cameron Diaz as the foster mom was hilarious and a role you don't usually see her in. Overall Annie is a loving, light-hearted movie great for families with kids of all ages!",Annie
265,pdavinci,Not worth the time,3,3 March 2015,"It's a shame what they did with a great musical, and practically butchered every song (and auto-tuned the sh't out of it)! Despite the fact that they changed Annie from being pale ginger girl to a black girl from the Bronx. And this has nothing to do with racial issues, but the mere fact that they changed too much of the story. Why change a winning team? For families with small kids and no expectations or knowledge of the genre this might be a movie to watch but despite that - huge disappointment. This might be an unpopular opinion, but musicals should be played by musical actors who are professionally trained for it, it doesn't matter if it's for the stage or in a movie. One might think Hollywoold learned something from the movie adaption of Les Miserables, but apparently they didn't.",Annie
266,john-28513,The Best,10,1 April 2015,"The opening of this movie pulls no punches. It opens exactly with the expectations of the audience in mind and quickly takes closure and ushers attention into a experience. My 9 year old son watched it a second time and my 4 year old is singing along to the songs. I could not get either of them to watch more than 4 minutes of the original. This movie is so funny! There are many reasons this is much more watchable than the original today for me. This movie and its director have an attention for small details that are off the track of the original but make it amusing to watch and in tune with our current culture. Hilarious and relaxed comedic personifications and character jokes that need not be but are and are very fun to watch. It is the personality of the movie that I like, it took everything I do not like about the original, chiefly the negative agency and removed it, leaving the best and adding the better elements of story resolve for a greater lift. It is not a grandly orchestrated as the original perhaps but does not need to be. It is not the original and it operates by a different set of intentions of which it astoundingly does very well.What the original accomplishes with archetype this current version gets to realistically.This is a re-watchable title.",Annie
267,joseedwin-87294,"Such a great movie, destroyed by songs.",7,20 April 2015,"TOO MUCH SONGS! I come from an Indian background, where in movies there is a few songs but this is just too much. It was such a great movie ruined by songs, I quite enjoyed it but to be honest I think that they emphasized the kids part of the movie too much. I mean they just had too many songs, 2 songs would have been alright but this is just insane. To conclude I really recommend this movie to anyone that has kids but other than that your gonna need a lot of patience to cope the songs. It has a good story that really shows a very important point, I often see it many times when the poor are not greedy and always happy with what they got and the rich opposite but to be honest I have also seen the complete opposite happen other areas so its more based on opinions,",Annie
268,daddysgiirlxxx,Running out of ideas,4,11 April 2015,"I honestly rather watch the good old fashion Annie, the re-make just shows you that writers and producers are running out of ideas. Also.. I think they made another Annie to not discriminate blacks. There's no need to keep proved equality involving blacks and whites. It's 2015, we have a black president. Another thing,it ruins a good classic film. The re-make is for my generation of people but if you're like me, you appreciate classics and not always what's new in style. Movies are getting lame year after year. However, there's always at least one good movie a year that appeals to me. (Thinking outside the box) Example: Shirley Temple show/movies, classic, never was a re-make . 1930's filmed Benjamin button: best movie , it was different and no movie the same. Filmed 2008",Annie

I love the actors and actresses and all of the songs. I have watched it several times now. I love how Quvenzhané Wallis gives off the ""okay, I don't care"" act when things rise up against her character (Annie) in the movie. But as she walks away, you can see her true emotion of hurt or sadness show through. I think that shows what a good actress she is growing up to be. I love the modern take on the original songs as well as the new songs added. I think this is a very well made movie. I wish it had better reviews than it has been getting.",Annie

I now have watched it twice in 24 hours. Loved it. I think Quvenzhané Wallis has played the best Annie character so far. She is not the bratty, grate on your nerves, little girl that is played in previous versions. I will be watching for her in the coming years to see how much she grows as an actor. The second time I watched it I watched it with my grandkids (ranging from 2 to 9 years old) and they thoroughly enjoyed it. For those who are more cautious there were a couple of scenes that we did fast forward because of the content. Cameron Diaz as Hannigan was very entertaining.",Annie

It has deep lines of life and a good storyline. I like Jaime Foxx's voice and I think that the little girl, Annie is very talented too. This film showed me, that even the big businessmen came from nowhere and started with nothing. It is a good movie for the family on the weekends. It contains a little seriousness, laugh, childhood and a little window to politics. This movie gave me hope for a better living. Cameron Diaz was great in it too. (Everywhere.) I like her act. Sometimes I was surprised that she can act this kind of role. The bad girl. The bad step-mother. She was great. I hoped that she will get on well with Lou in the end.",Annie

Some of the casting was seriously bad. Cameron Diaz as the sadistic ugly alcoholic Miss Hannigan was particularly difficult to believe.The songs all sounded like Britney spears was singing them in a studio.The Billionaire Oliver Warbucks, played by Jammie Fox, was characterised as a jackass. What happened to the feared respected self made man, that rose from a working class background?! Part of the beauty of the original film was watching the cold exterior of this character being replaced with the emotions of a parent!

My 3yr old daughter is obsessed with it and even my husband who hates musicals really liked this one because there is a much more realistic vibe to it; the beats are groovy, the singing is impeccable and it is not accompanied by excessive dancing involving a group of 100 all with the same facial expression :) Yeap, this is not your typical musical...it is so much better!! Instead of skipping the singing moments you play them over and over again. And the kid..Annie...OH MY what a voice!

Our eleven year old daughter loves the musical more than anything. She has watched it so much, now she fast forward to the musical. Our son relates to the movie more so because he was adopted. I tell you no lie we've literally watches it everyday, so as for the very deep harsh criticism I think are related to the skin color of the main character and directors. Relating this movie with the original version is not fair. First, the movies are made from a different time period. Secondly, the original version was made by an all or majority white cast and directors. The new Annie movie is made with a mixed of blacks and whites cast and directors. Thank you to everyone who had something to do with making this movie. Another movie we can watch as a family over and over and doesn't get boring!!!",Annie
275,remilhi,The worst movie ever,1,6 March 2015,I have never left a review for a movie before but after watching this version of Annie I felt I really should. First of all in my sixty odd years I have seen some pretty bad movies but this is the worst ever. After leaving the theater I really wanted to ask for my money back. What they did to the music was on the verge of criminal they took a perfectly good score and turned it to trash. As for the acting we won't even go there. Rose Byrne tried hard to put some sort of light into her role but the rest of the cast just plodded as if they were thinking what the hell got into them to accept their parts. A lesson for future producers and directors if it's not broken don't try to fix it. Why change a hit.,Annie

No movie made for kids will be free of cheesiness, but for what it is-a kids' movie-I thought it was pretty adorable. I like the modernized versions of the songs, so much so that I think I actually prefer this version of It's the Hard Knock Life.",Annie

I didn't think Cameron Diaz was that bad as Hannign but I do think they should of cast someone who was a better singer. I LOVED Stephanie Kurtzuba's small role as the social services person.
