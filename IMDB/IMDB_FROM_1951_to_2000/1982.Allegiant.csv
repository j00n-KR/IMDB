0,Leofwine_draca,"Better than Insurgent, but still no good",4,18 January 2017,"ALLEGIANT is the third film in the DIVERGENT series, following on from the rubbish INSURGENT. Originally there were meant to be four films in the franchise but this film did so badly at the box office that there's talk of the fourth film being a TV movie which will be interesting to say the least. I really don't like this franchise at all, finding it a mere rip-off of THE HUNGER GAMES which was itself a teen-friendly rip-off of BATTLE ROYALE, but the good news is that ALLEGIANT is much better than the last film in the series, although that doesn't make it good.INSURGENT was all about predictability and mindless action whereas ALLEGIANT at least has a plot of sorts, even if it isn't a very good one. The same problems that exist with the first two films are also present here, with too much time given over to teen moping around and all of the established adult stars limited to showing up, intoning a few lines of dialogue, and disappearing again. Shailene Woodley makes for an ultra-annoying heroine and hardly someone you can root for. The running time is overlong and too much of the story is padded out with scenes of characters travelling around. The thing that annoys me is the needless way they throw in CGI shot after CGI shot as if that's going to hold the attention; the bit where they float about in those giant bubbles is the nadir of this film. Still, some of the sub-plots are mildly interesting, and at least this film appears to be going somewhere which is better than normal for the franchise.",Allegiant
1,SnoopyStyle,some more explanation,5,24 January 2017,"Jeanine is dead. Evelyn (Naomi Watts) is putting her followers on show trials and bans escaping Chicago. Johanna (Octavia Spencer) starts organizing an opposition. Tris (Shailene Woodley) breaks out her brother Caleb with the help of Four (Theo James). Peter (Miles Teller) forces his way onto their escape plan. They are joined by Christina but Tori is killed. Outside of Chicago, they find forces under David (Jeff Daniels) who is conducting the experiment to 'fix' human genes.I don't read the books. I'm not a big fan of the first two movies. I don't believe in the world being built by the franchise. It never made sense to me. In this sequel, the world is expanding and an explanation is presented. While this world is still problematic, it finally makes some internal logic. It's still dumb. I do like Woodley and she has the charisma to lead. This is not a favorite franchise to start and it's losing even more steam.",Allegiant
2,Hitchcoc,Only Saw This One,6,1 April 2016,"I had originally expressed no interest in this series, but was invited to go along with some friends to see Allegiant. In order to have some knowledge of what was going on, I read detailed synopses of the first two movies. A lot takes place and I tried to absorb it. Still, I was the least informed. That said, it took me quite a while to figure out why people were acting the way they were. Who were the villains and who were the good guys. I realize that the leads were the ones we were supposed to root for. They worked so hard to get to this paradise. But wouldn't you know it, Jeff Daniels was there and he wasn't nice at all. The direction this took with a memory erasing gas was beyond the limits of my suspension of disbelief. It's the kind of thing a seventh grader would come up with for a short story assignment. I'm also astonished by the expertise at the time of crisis. A totally unfamiliar machine is mastered by poking at it. This is kind of the schtick that is used on Star Trek the Next Generation. Anyway, the thing is pretty lame.",Allegiant
3,Prismark10,Indigestion,2,8 December 2016,"Let us be honest the Divergent series of films have never been good despite the fact that they have managed to attract big name actors such as Kate Winslet.My interest in this movie piqued because I accidentally stumbled into some location filming.In the last instalment evil leader Jeanine (Kate Winslet) was killed. Now she has been replaced by formerly faction less guerrilla leader Evelyn (Naomie Watts) who is Four's mother and also just as evil, angling for more conflict with various factions.Evelyn and her gang has plans to dominate Dystopian Chicago. Tris (Shailene Woodley,) her boyfriend Four (Theo James,) her brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort,) her friend Christina (Zoe Kravitz) and sneaky Peter (Miles Teller) go over the city wall and enter a red radiated ravaged wasteland called the Fringe. Beyond the Fringe is an advanced futuristic base called the Bureau of Genetic Welfare led David (Jeff Daniels) who is a Pure and explains that past experiments in genetic modification led to warfare and how they plan to undo the damage.However can David be trusted? Tris does but Four things something is not right. The clue is that David has installed an elaborate surveillance system in Chicago and also placed it with pipes to dispense memory erasing gas. The plan is replace the factions with more factions.There are a lot of special effects in this movie but it seems to be inspired by other films such as Mad Max: Fury Road or Tron: Legacy and some of the green screen CGI looks dicey.The biggest problem is the story is dull and very half baked. The characters uninteresting, only Miles Teller brings a bit of spirit to his shifty character, we know David is a generic villain. The film is overlong and to think they stretched this film into two parts when there was no need for it.",Allegiant
4,claudio_carvalho,Too Long and Boring Franchise,4,9 July 2016,"""The Divergent Series: Allegiant"" is another part of this too long and boring franchise. The saga of Tris and Four and their friends is repetitive and predictable, using clichés and special effects. The screenplay is poor and stupid. For example, David is capable to close doors and remotely controls the city; why does he need someone to release the gas in Chicago? The worst is that the story does not end and there will be another sequel to gross more money for the producers. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""A Série Divergente: Convergente"" (""The Divergent Series: convergent"")",Allegiant
5,nogodnomasters,It's what you do for family,8,12 March 2018,"This is a sequel not to that Maze thing but the other one which copied ""Brave New World."" The film opens up with the revolutionaries killing off the Czars' family, reminding me of another sci-fi book. Some of our crew escapes... I mean really escape as they climb Trumps' wall, however not without a casualty... PLOT SPOILER token hot Asian chick (Maggie Q) dies early. They make their way into the contaminated post apocalyptic world, moving into a plot giving me ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" flashback. Here they meet civilization as we await one more twist as there is too much time left in the film for they not to be one.Except for Peter (Miles Teller) the acting was stiff. Jeff Daniels as Director David didn't add anything. I would have changed this up a bit and put in a flaky Woody Harrelson type of guy. The film had great 1984 style lines like, ""Your destiny begins today."" I kept attempting to get a theme from the film such as the role of propaganda and recreating the past for the betterment of a diverse society, but it was presented lightly if indeed it was meant to be there. Perhaps those who read the books could shed some light on the theme.Guide: No swearing, sex, or real nudity. Shailene Woodley strips and burns her clothes, but lighting and camera angle maintain the rating. Soft 4 stars. When is that Maze thing sequel coming out, and why were they put in that maze again?",Allegiant
6,kosmasp,Are we there yet? No?,5,5 December 2016,"It's part 3 and there is still no end in sight. I think, because I have no clue how many books there are. The first one was pretty good, but it gets kind of redundant and even with all story that unfolds and all the things that can be connected with Hunger Games, it never will reach the popularity of it.I really like Woodley, but she does not have a lot to work with. It is filled with clichés, characters are badly drawn, the tension doesn't work most of the time. Still if you like Science Fiction and don't mind city wide plot holes and an uninspired plus predictable plot, you can have fun with the movie.",Allegiant
7,Tweekums,Beyond the wall,7,21 July 2019,"After the events of the previous film Evelyn, Four's mother, has taken control of Chicago and has banned anybody from going beyond the city wall. Those who sided with Erudite are to be tried, and if found guilty executed; this includes Tris's brother Caleb. He is rescued by Tris and Four and along with Peter and a couple of others they flee the city only to discover a wasteland. Just as they start to think they might be doomed they are met by soldiers from the 'Bureau of Genetic Welfare' and taken to their home city. This city has technology far in advance of anything in Chicago and it is soon explained how Chicago is their experiment; everything that happens there is observed. Its inhabitants are considered genetically damaged but Tris is 'pure' so is taken to see David, the city's leader. At first David seems benevolent but it isn't long before Four has he doubts... our protagonist will have to fight again if they are to save the people of Chicago.I must say this is probably the weakest of the three 'Divergent' films and not just because it is a final film in the series which was meant to have another and thus sets things up for a finale that never happened. Other problems include the fact that Chicago is technologically so far behind the Bureau of Genetic Welfare whose tech is too sci-fi in comparison. We also have the very sudden breakdown of the established order in Chicago and for me the most irritating... the group continue to trust the weasel Peter who betrayed them before and doesn't waste long before doing it again. That said I don't think this was actually a bad film; just less than I hoped for. I liked that there was a good explanation as to why people in Chicago could be so easily categorised and that there was enough exciting action to keep me interested. The cast was solid; most notable Shailene Woodley and Theo James as Tris and Four. The effects are decent although some are more what one would expect in a good TV show rather than a big budget film. Overall I'd say that I enjoyed this and would recommend it to anybody who enjoyed the previous instalments in the series... just a pity we never got the concluding film as too many plot lines are unresolved.",Allegiant
8,ma-cortes,Third exciting outing of the moving trilogy in which the former thorny questions are resolved,5,17 August 2019,"This third part contains impressive fights , chills , frenetic action, high body-count , breathtaking state-of-art-special effects, enough characterization , and violent happenings . Allegiant third part , is the follow-up on the trilogy in which Tris will be forced to make hard choices about courage , love , loyalty , and Allegiant. It is a Sci-Fi , action and drama movie based on a novel by Veronica Roth. Stars sixteen-year-old Tris , Shailene Woodley, who lives in a dystopian Society formed by untouchable castes , five factions confronting among them. Dealing the previous two episodes with Tris who lives in a destroyed city of Chicago, in a difficult society divided into factions and, nowadays, she searches answers on the ruins of the town. As each faction represents a diverse way of handling things. Candor are the honest. Erudite are the intelligent, in which her brother, Ansel Elgort, belongs. Abnegation the selfless, in which her parents : Ashley Judd, Tony Goldwyn belong. Amity the kind. And finally Dauntless the brave, in which Tris enlists herself after an extremely dangerous training . The Erudite led by Kate Winslet , have declared war against Abnegation because they think that they have essential information about Divergent. Then the Erudite scheme a massacre against Abnegation. Along the way Tris and her fiance , Theo James , search answers in and out of Chicago .Then, Tris unlocks secrets , uncovering horrible deeds and along with his partners and with the help from others on his side carry out a strong fight against a nasty alliance .

Third inferior part , formed by ¨Divergent¨ , ¨Insurgent¨ , and this ¨Allegiant¨ , plenty of noisy action , thrills , battles and emotion . Here our starring Tris faces one impossible challenge after another, as she unreveals the truth about her past and future , ultimately, the meaning of the strange and mysterious divergence, as well as the dark perspective on her sad world run by dark forces ; though it turns out to be tiring, confusing and a little bit boring. And finally, the conclusion and unexpected denouement with a lot of surprises . This is a homogenized and without much sense science fiction for bored adolescents . The film takes parts here and there of the two previous installments. It was another kind of the Hunger Games variant , based in a dystopian future world of a strict cast system . It attempts to close the thrilling trilogy , but it ends regularly , including flaws and failures .Starring Shailene Woodley gives nice acting as the valiant teen who is really haunted by her past, as well as she must confront her inner demons. She is well accompanied by a good support cast to be with her in the three entries, such as : Ansel Elgort , Ray Stevenson, Jeff Daniels , Miles Teller, Zoe Kravitz, Ashley Judd ,Daniel Dae Kim , Abigail Spencer , Bill Skarsgård
Mekhi Phifer, Maggie Q, Ben Lloyd Hughes, and Naomi Watts .It contains a pounding and exciting musical score by Joseph Trapanese . As well as an adequate and colorful cinematography by Florián Balhaus. The motion picture was middlingly directed by Robert Schewenke, though Neil Burger who made the first entry was meant to direct the flick , but coundn't due to scheduling conflicts with postproduction on Divergent 2014 . Robert is a German craftsman who has made a few films , such as The time traveler wife , Tattoo , Flight plan , Insurgent , Allegiant and his last one made in Germany , and The captain .",Allegiant
9,Coventry,The grass is always greener on the other side of the invisible portal,2,28 January 2019,"I already wasted too much time and words on the ""Divergent""-series, which was quite mediocre and dull to begin with, and the third entry ""Allegiant"" is the absolute low point of the trilogy. Therefore, in terms of plot, I will restrict myself to the main highlights. Naomi Watts replaces Kate Winslet as the megalomaniac über-evil wench, Theo James probably complained about his inferior sidekick role in the previous instalment and gets to be a hero again, and Jeff Daniels plays his most idiotic role since ""Dumb and Dumber"". Everything else is the same type of predictable dystopian guff targeted at teenage girls who grew tired of ""Twilight"" and ""The Hunger Games"".Tris and her clique, including useless brother Caleb and the treacherous Peter who backstabbed them at least 15 times already, climb over the prison wall that surrounds futuristic Chicago and head out to seek remnants of a better civilization. They find civilization, alright, a highly sophisticated one that has been orchestrating the entire Faction system and watched the devastating wars like a reality show on TV! Leader David fools Tris into believing that her 100% divergence is key to end all Faction wars, but her toy-boy Four (as well as everybody else with a minimum of intellect) suspects that these snobs aren't the least bit interested in saving the citizens of Chicago. I didn't think it was possible, but the stories of these films become more preposterous while suspense and credibility vanish entirely. The special effects in ""Allegiant"" are pathetic, like for example an invisible portal entrance in the middle of an apocalyptic wasteland or David's flying egg-cooker. If you are older than 16, please go and seek out some genuinely unsettling post-apocalyptic or dystopian Sci-Fi classics, like ""Logan's Run"", ""Silent Running"", ""Fahrenheit 451"" or ""THX-1138""",Allegiant
10,CinemaSerf,"Should have been called ""Hebetant"" instead...",5,30 March 2020,"Picking up where ""Insurgent"" left off; ""Tris"" and ""Four"" determine that they must escape the walls of Chicago and make a new life for themselves - regardless of the risks and uncertainty. Once free - perhaps the only few moments of tension in the film - they hook up with a group of ostensibly like-minded rebels; but are they who they say they are? Seeds of suspicion are sewn that test the relationship between Theo & Shailene; and frankly the patience of the viewer. Jeff Daniels tries hard to inject some menace as ""David"" but Miles Teller ""Peter"" is just plain irritating. We are clearly heading for a grand-scale denouement, but where is it? Instead someone decided to leave us with some ambiguity (I suspect a fourth in the franchise may have been, at one stage, on the cards?) The actors are going through the motions as though they, too, can't wait for the conclusion so they can all go home for ice cream. It looks good, they look good, but it isn't much good...",Allegiant
11,zardoz-13,Not As Damaged As They Are Saying,7,20 March 2016,"The second sequel in ""The Divergent Series"" entitled ""Allegiant"" finally lets our non-conformist heroine Tris Prior and her quartet of companions escape from Chicago. The Summit Entertainment/Lionsgate franchise kept Tris and company confined to the ravaged Windy City metropolis in both ""Divergent"" (2014) and ""Insurgent"" (2015), while the five factions vying for dominance collapsed after Jeanine's conspiracy to destroy another group Abnegation. ""Divergent"" did a first-rate job of forging the franchise, formulating those antagonistic five factions, and furnishing us another gorgeous gal with gumption. The audacious ""Insurgent"" ensued and shattered the quasi-peace that existed among those five factions. Actually, one faction had been obliterated by ""Insurgent"" so four remained, but the cohesion of those factions was coming apart at the seams. Now, in ""Allegiant,"" with only two groups of survivors locking horns and a civil war threatening, our heroine and her pals take it on the lam, scale the wall, and plunge beyond Chicago into an irradiated wasteland to confront the Founders control the city and its inhabitants. Although I read the novel ""Divergent,"" I skipped both ""Insurgent"" and ""Allegiant,"" so I have no idea how faithfully the filmmakers have adhered to author Veronica Roth's post-apocalyptic, young adult trilogy. Predictably, nothing happens to either Tris or Four, and this constitutes a problem with ""Allegiant."" After the superb ""Divergent,"" where both of protagonist's parents perished, and then ""Insurgent"" eliminated two major villains, ""Allegiant"" struggles to maintain sufficient tension despite its plethora of action scenes. Indeed, the loss of Jeanine—an awesome adversary by any standard in ""Divergent"" as well as ""Insurgent""--and the two lackluster substitutes for her—Evelyn and David—undermines this less above-average sequel. Moreover, neither Jeff Daniels nor Naomi Watts as David and Evelyn respectively can overshadow for Jeanine's villainous presence. Further, the loss of a second villain, Eric (Jai Courtney of ""Terminator Genisys""), in ""Insurgent"" proves almost as irreplaceable. Strong sci-fi action scenes mustering futuristic aircraft and infantry hardware bolster the storyline, but the absence of dastardly villains diminishes the friction.""Insurgent"" director Robert Schwentke knows how to stage adventurous action with computer generated special effects, and he flaunts his expertise with a crackerjack opening sequence. Initially, we learn (as if we didn't know) Jeanine and her oppressive regime are dead and gone. Jeanine's lieutenants aren't alive for long. A defiant Max (Mekhi Phifer of ""Dawn of the Dead"") suffers the wrath of the downtrodden that he rode roughshod over for Jeanine. Chicago's new leader, Evelyn (Naomi Watts of ""King Kong""), stages tribunals to punish the guilty. Evelyn's chief lieutenant, Edgar (Jonny Weston of ""Taken 3""), caps Max in the back of the head after the crowd gives a thumbs-down signal for Max to bite it. Of course, we hear the explosive blast of Edgar's revolver, but Schwentke doesn't show the bloody obliteration of Max's noggin. After all, the Motion Picture Producers Association rated ""Allegiant"" PG-13 ""for intense violence and action, thematic elements, and some partial nudity."" The next candidate awaiting execution is none other than Tris' brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort of ""Carrie""), and he pleads for mercy. Four (Theo James of ""Underworld: Awakening"") uses his position as Evelyn's son to haul a cowering Caleb out of jail, fake his death, and then spirit him out of the city. Tris (Shailene Woodley of ""The Descendants""), Christina (Zoë Kravitz of ""After Earth""), Tori (Maggie Q of ""Priest""), and Peter (Miles Teller of ""The Maze Runner"") accompany them. The suspense in this scene you make you squirm. Too late, Edgar discovers Four's treachery and mobilizes manpower to pursue Tris and company. Evelyn warns Edgar to bring back her son alive.Our heroic quintet imitates Batman and Robin from the 1960s era ""Batman"" television show. After they fire grappling hooks at the fence atop the wall, they hoist themselves vertically up the wall by means of wires that reel them in to the top of the barricade. Unfortunately, nothing is a picnic, and Tris has to brave a barrage of gunfire from Edgar and company after she learns that Evelyn electrified the fence at the top of the wall. Indeed, Evelyn has become every bit as autocratic as Jeanine; she has sealed off Chicago so nobody can set foot outside of the city. If you missed ""Insurgent,"" you should know Tris received a message from the Founders on the far side of the wall inviting her to visit them. Tris blows up the truck pumping electricity into the fence, and our heroic horde crosses the wall. Tragically, one of the quintet doesn't survive. Later, our weary warriors find themselves trudging through a bleak, forbidding, Martian-like landscape. As it turns out, humanity waged a nuclear war some 200 years ago. The skies shower them with toxic red rainfall, and then they encounter trigger-happy Edgar again as he careens after them in gleeful pursuit. Edgar gets the surprise of his life when the landscape in front of him magically changes, like a huge mirage, to reveal an army of infantry and aerial assault craft hovering on the other side. The soldiers welcome our heroes and transport them back to a glittering city on the site of what once was O'Hare International Airport. Tris meets the well-dressed head of the Bureau of Genetic Welfare, David (Jeff Daniels of ""Gods and Generals""), who claims that he has been watching her with an elaborate surveillance systems since her birth.Mind you, ""Allegiant"" is another example of those novels that the studio split into two parts to boost box office receipts. Consequently, it may be presumptuous to criticize ""Allegiant"" for lacking the tenacity of its predecessors, since the third sequel will finalize everything. Indeed, like previous franchises, including ""Harry Potter,"" ""Twilight,"" and ""The Hunger Games,"" studios were reluctant to conclude their cash cows. Unlike the second lackluster ""Hunger Games,"" ""Allegiant"" propels the narrative forward, pits our protagonists against perils galore, and introduces new obstacles, without giving away entirely everything left to come in the final film.",Allegiant
12,oscaralbert,There are many reasons why this trilogy wrap-up should be titled DETERGENT . . .,7,21 March 2016,". . . because so very much debris from other flicks comes out in its wash, as the DIVERGENT films wind up with more of a plagiarized whimper than an original Big Bang. Take your pick: Is the best piece from STAR WARS the Imperial Stormtrooper-like suits, or the arid wastelands? Do you see more of MAZE RUNNER in ALLEGIANT's constantly running and rappelling youngsters, or in its vast array of high tech doors and force field barriers? Similarly, would the top rip-off from the HUNGER GAMES here be the self-perpetuating leadership rotation of Hitler clones, or the income disparity between the Haves and the Have Nots? Do you find more of THE GIVER in the Memory-Begone gas, the concept of a Human Guinea Pig majority, or a civilization walling itself off from the rest of the Planet? Speaking of Space, which reminds you more of ELYSIUM--a handful of Utopians trying to micromanage a comparative Stone Age Rabble for no apparent reason, or the Rabble's implausible and wasteful destruction of a Superior Society?",Allegiant
13,neil-476,OK-ish,7,23 March 2016,"With Jeanine defeated (and dead), Evelyn shows signs of becoming every bit the dictator her predecessor was, so Triss and friends escape Chicago and go into the blasted wastes outside where they find unexpected stuff which turns out to be not exactly what they had initially believed it to be (oh the problems of writing a spoiler-free synopsis).With this third entry, the Divergent series finally begins to feel like its own thing, not something which is nicking bits from various other well-known franchises. Unfortunately, what it's nicking is bits from every dystopian post-apocalyptic bit of sci-fi ever, but at least we're (mostly) spared the further adventures of Katniss and harry Potter's sorting hat.The good here is that the eye candy is well done, the action is well staged, there are less indistinguishable and interchangeable spear-carrier characters, there is (slightly) more plot than jeopardy and chase, and Jeff Daniels is terrific.Less good is the fact that some decent names are, again, in blink and you'll miss 'em roles, the main thug (stepping into Jai Courtney's shoes) appears to get a comeuppance but we're never shown it, and there never seems to be much at stake emotionally. Oh, and there is one of those mind-numbingly stupid moments when everyone stands around talking instead of getting out of danger, with predictable results. But I quite liked it anyway.",Allegiant
14,phd_travel,Grand looking but weak story,5,18 March 2016,This movie is visually grand although the story feels weak. From the frying pan into the fire - is the main theme. Bit pointless back and forth when you think of it. Good points: Visually this movie exceeds the last 2 by far. Leaving Chicago we get to see some post apocalyptic scenes and a very modern O'Hare airport. Liked the helicopters. Naomi Watts is much more watchable than Kate Winslet. She is amazingly young looking for her age - how could she be Theo James's mother? A generally photogenic multi racial cast is easier on the eyes than the other YAF movies. Bad points: Things get a bit dull in the middle. Losing Maggie Q so early was a mistake. She is one of the more convincing actresses for this kind of movie. Ansel and Miles are a bit too lame even after 3 movies.Over all - see it for completion. Much more palatable than the silly and ridiculous Hunger Games finales.,Allegiant
15,siderite,So lazy it hurts,5,23 July 2016,"The movie takes the exact same plot, style and ideas from the first two films in the series and does absolutely nothing new with them. There is less tension, everything makes no sense, is in your face obvious and bland. It's not even the end of the story. Remember when franchises were just trilogies? Those were the days. In fact, the series will turn into a real TV series through a fitting connection: the next film in the franchise called Ascendant, which will be a TV film.When the film started I couldn't remember what story it was continuing. Scenes from Hunger Games and Maze Runner and bits of trailers and teasers were mixed inside my brain and somehow completely covered the entire length of the movie. I kid you not, I had the sensation that I had already seen every single scene. It was that obscenely unimaginative.Bottom line: a complete waste of time. The Maze Runner is much better than this, even if it has almost the same exact plot.",Allegiant
16,Hellmant,About as good as 'INSURGENT'.,9,23 March 2016,"'THE DIVERGENT SERIES: ALLEGIANT': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The third part in 'THE DIVERGENT' film series; and the first half of an adaptation on the third (and final) book 'Allegiant' (written by Veronica Roth). This movie has Tris and Four escaping through the wall, encircling the dystopian Chicago, and finding a new advanced society of people, that have been studying them for years. The film has Shailene Woodley, Theo James, Miles Teller, Ansel Elgort, Zoe Kravitz, Maggie Q, Jonny Weston, Ocatvia Spencer and Naomi Watts all reprising their roles (from earlier films); and Jeff Daniels joins the cast. It was directed by Robert Schwentke; and scripted by Bill Collage, Adam Cooper and Noah Oppenheim. I enjoyed it quite a bit. This chapter begins with Evelyn (Watts) taking control of Chicago; after murdering Jeanine (played by Kate Winslet, in the previous movies), at the end of the last installment. Her soldiers prevent everyone from leaving the city, and begin executing Jeanine's conspirators. Tris (Woodley) and Four (James) rescue Tris's brother, Caleb (Elgort), from being killed. They then decide to break through the wall, locking them in the city, and see what's beyond it.I was a big fan of the first 'DIVERGENT' movie, and really enjoyed the second film as well (although not quite as much). I think this installment is about as good as 'INSURGENT'. I'm not sure why the reviews are so harsh (or why the Box Office has dropped off, so much), but I really like it. It's a lot of fun, the visuals are spectacular, and the action scenes are awesome (they're actually an improvement over the previous chapters). Woodley, James and Watts all give great performances (once again), and the story is involving (and mostly fast-paced). I think fans of the series should be more than pleased.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/vlqkdyuq2zY",Allegiant
17,ThomasDrufke,Yet Another Clichéd and Predictable Young Adult Film,4,20 March 2016,"The age of the young adult franchises are upon us now more than ever with yet another entry in the 'Divergent' series being released. Maybe it's just me, but I'm growing tired of weak films filled with same old clichés and unoriginal story lines based around the genre of 'young adult sci-fi'. Sure, a lot of people can say the same thing about the overabundance of superhero films, but there's a clear difference in quality. But the bottom line is that I'm just not the audience for these films.Allegiant directly follows the events from Insurgent after the demise of Kate Winslet's Jeanine character. Naomi Watts reprises her role as Evelyn and pretty much follows the same unfortunate path that Jeanine did as leader of the dystopian Chicago. Four and Tris, played by Shailene Woodley, lead a small group of survivors into the outside world which was teased at the end of the last film. From there, every cliché you can possibly think of, follows. The characters who you think will die, die. The people who you think will be good or bad, end up being good or bad. There is nothing surprising or noteworthy about the film's plot.The positives do however come from some of the performances. Theo James continues to be a pleasant surprise and does as much as he can with a weak script. He has a definite future in the film business. Woodley is solid as she usually is and so is Jeff Daniels and Naomi Watts. The problem is that the film around them is average at best. The pacing is painfully slow at times and nothing really happens until the final 20 minutes. Of course, it's set up for an unnecessary and unplanned 4th film purely for the reasons of making money, because there could have easily been an ending here. Overall, a weak script and horrible green screen moments end up making a disappointing third entry in the series.+Music+Performances from James and others-Green screen moments-Pacing-Nothing original and full of clichés4.8/10",Allegiant
18,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,4,10 July 2016,"The Divergent Series: Allegiant The problem with a society run by teenagers is that all essential services would cease during July and August.Fortunately, the young folk in this sci-fi film have no idea what summer vacation is.Resistance supporter Tris (Shailene Woodley) refuses leadership of the opposition for a chance to explore outside her post-apocalyptic home.Along with some friends (Theo James, Ansel Elgort, Miles Teller, Zoë Kravitz), Tris is eventually captured by the Bureau head honcho (Jeff Daniels) and told of the genetic war that led to the social factions that control her and her friends' fates.The first instalment of the final chapter, this third entry in the dystopian series is also the worst.

19,The-Sarkologist,The series isn't getting any better,2,16 April 2016,"I really should stop going an seeing these movies because while I didn't mind the first in the series, the second wasn't all that great. As is the case with the law of diminishing returns this one was down right boring. In fact I ended up falling asleep halfway through and had to catch up with what I missed by reading the wikipedia article. In fact, I am going to do my best to resist the temptation to see the final installment, which is due out next year, though knowing myself a little bit to much I'll probably end up going just to find out how the series ends.Anyway, Allegiant starts where the previous movie finished off. The factions have been broken up and the city of Chicgao has descended into mob rule. The ring leaders are being rounded up, thrust through a kangaroo court and then summarily executed, all in front of a roaring crowd. It becomes pretty clear that Tris and Four probably should get out before everything starts heading south (though it is pretty clear that this has already happened). So they rescue Tris' brother and make a run for the walls, where they discover what it is actually like outside.Well, this film is now turning into one of those post-apocalyptic movies, where we have another faction outside of the city that created the city as some form of genetic experiment. Apparently the world destroyed itself through a series of eugenic wars (it sounds as if the whole idea was stolen from Star Trek, and I have at admit that the Star Trek version was much better – which is saying something considering that I am not a big fan of Star Trek). As it turns out these guys that are running the experiment aren't the nicest of people, so our heroes then much put a stop to their nefarious plans (which basically sets up the plot of the next film).Mind you, I'm sort of wandering what the whole point of the story actually is. Under the factions life was pretty horrible, and once the factions were removed, life is pretty horrible. Is the author trying to suggest that the while the system that we have at the moment isn't the best, it certainly is much better than mob rule. Mind you, that has always been the case, especially when we look at how revolutions unfolded in the past. This is why I tend to prefer reform from inside that outright toppling a government. Still, the suggestion at the end is that we are stuffed if we do and we are stuffed if we don't, so we might as well do nothing.",Allegiant
20,Reno-Rangan,Realising what's left behind was the home.,6,14 July 2016,"Here comes the most expected adventure in the 'Divergent' series. I always wondered what lies outside the wall. So this sequel takes us to the new land where a fresh development takes place. A few old characters were terminated in order to introduce a bunch of new ones. As a theme, it just looked like 'The Scorch Trial', but of course totally a different setting. The director was retained from the previous installment and I think he did a good job. The concept was too familiar. 'Scorch Trial', 'Catching Fire', 'Aeon Flux', all these films are just like this one. Thankfully, this story was decent. At least better than the previous and weaker than the first. The pace drastically held back due to the split of a book into two films. It has been done in the old days, but the present trend began after 'Deathly Hallows'.I was excited to know how big stretch it is going to be as a story wise. Because it looked like the things they've accomplished in one place and looking to explore beyond the boundary. I couldn't predict the story, but I knew what's going to happen in the end of every scene. The dystopian theme was clichéd, not the storyline. The way it ended is a sign for a big finale to commence in the final film of the series. Let's hope for 'Ascendant' to end on a high note.6/10",Allegiant
21,Thanos_Alfie,The worst end of a trilogy...,3,3 November 2018,"""Allegiant"" is the third movie of The Divergent Series in which we watch Tris trying to escape with Four from Chicago. In order to do that they have to pass from the big wall that encircles Chicago. After their escape, they discover shocking truths of the world around them. A very big battle is ready to start beyond the walls of Chicago which threaten all of humanity and they don't know who to trust and what to do about it.Since I had seen the previous two movies of this trilogy I have to admit that I had high hopes from this movie and I was let down by it. I have to mention that I really liked the first movie because it was something very different from any other movie I had seen. The second movie was an average one and now the third movie is the worst. I did not like the plot because it was boring at many points with no plot twists and not a lot of scenes that would have made this movie interesting. The combination of a not well-written script with a poor direction which was made by Robert Schwentke did not give this movie a chance of becoming interesting. The interpretation of Theo James who played once more as Four was not enough to save the movie and the poor interpretation of Shailene Woodley's drag him down.Finally, I have to say that ""Allegiant"" is not a nice movie to watch and I believe that if you are going to watch it you will be disappointed by it. I really do not recommend anyone to watch it since I am sure that you are going to waste your time. Even if you are a true fan of this movie series or even of the books I think that you won't enjoy it.",Allegiant
22,Floated2,Messy and overly confusing,3,6 December 2020,"As enjoyed the original Divergent film and finding the sequel Insurgent lesser, but now after watching this third instalment. It is quite easily the worst of the franchise. The plot is quite simple and the sci-fi and visuals are very nice but the plot doesn't offer much of interest. A rather confusing full of ""twists"" which are brought up but doesn't offer much explanations.Jeff Daniels introduction character was rather irritating and doesn't offer anything but a standard villain. Less action and more so drama in this film as opposed to the previous two. And an ending which was apparently left as a cliffhanger but seeing as this film flopped there won't be another installation.",Allegiant
23,pennyelenabooks,Good enough,3,25 July 2016,"After watching the third movie of the divergent series, I'm left with mixed feelings. Sure it wasn't as bad as the second movie, but it wasn't as good as the first either. As I haven't read the books I can't judge whether it was close to the real thing or not. However, the story was a little complicated and the actions wasn't there, the twists were few and far between, with the big ""mystery"" not helping to close the gaps of the plot. The special effects were okay, as well as the costumes. And as for the performances, they were descent enough for an action YA movie, though the romance wasn't really there, as the couple lucked chemistry. So 3 out of 10.",Allegiant
24,filipemanuelneto,Too bad they didn't make the last film to end the story.,6,14 February 2021,"After the resounding success of ""Hunger Games"", American studios were hungry for more films and trilogies for young adults. ""Maze Runner"" and ""Divergent"" were two of the most evident cases, with scripts and source material that, in everything, remind us of ""Hunger Games"".This film marks the end of the ""Divergent"" trilogy, unfinished because the fourth film imagined never became a reality. It was a pity. Personally, I am an apologist that such an effort, when started, should be ended, if only out of respect for the public. Unfortunately, the studio's interests spoke louder.In this film, we finally discover everything outside the walls of Chicago: a world of aridity and devastation, where a mysterious health organization watches over everyone and everything in order to discover more quickly how to restore damage to the human genome. But not everything is as it seems, and the organization is more murky than it appears.Imported from the previous film, the cast is quite good and competent. Shailene Woodley is beautiful and does a good job. Theo James was also excellent, particularly in the action scenes, and had even more space and time to work here. Evelyn was brilliantly played by Naomi Watts, clearly implying that she is not, and never will be, a good option for governing the city. On the negative side, Zoe Kravitz and Ansel Elgort both disappear from the film.Technically, the film is visually impressive. The cinematography is excellent, vibrant and sharp, and I loved the landscapes of a half-destroyed and decadent Chicago, of dry rivers and lakes and devastated buildings. Incredible, but not coherent: if the entire human population was there, wouldn't more space be needed? Why not rebuild the buildings? Didn't they have two hundred years of peace to do so? Another thing I liked and found amazing was the action and fighting sequences. Really well executed. The sets and costumes were very well done, the highlight being the Agency's facilities and the city of Providence, two sets that even seem worthy of a Star Trek film.",Allegiant
25,leonblackwood,Could have been better! 5/10,5,6 September 2016,"Review: After enjoying the first movie in the Divergent franchise but not being that impressed with second film, Insurgent, I really thought that this franchise would go out with a bang, with Allegiant but it seemed exactly the same as the other movies. Tris (Shailene Woodley) and Four (Theo James), haven't really moved on since the first movie and the storyline wasn't that great. I decided to watch all of the movies together, and it did just seem like another Hunger Games but without the clever CGI and impressive action scenes. As I haven't read the books, I don't know how close the movies are to the writers characters and storyline but as she was on set while they were making the films, I'm sure she wouldn't have allowed them to make a mock out of her vision. I still thought that the franchise was average, and not anything that amazing, and it didn't feel like a true ending to the Tris and Four journey. With David (Jeff Daniels), taking the role of Jeanine (Kate Winslet) as the baddie, I personally didn't think that his character was that great and the whole ""Saving Chicago"" element didn't really seem to come to an end. Insurgent and Allegiant doesn't really do Divergent any justice, because I was hoping to see Tris take on the role as a true leader, with Four as the leader of the army but there is still question marks about were they will go in life. Anyway, I was hoping for a massive showdown with this movie but I was totally let down with the outcome, which is a shame because there was so potential for the franchise. Average!Round-Up: This movie was directed by Robert Schwentke, who brought you Flightplan in 2005, The Time Traveller's Wife, RED, R.I.P.D. and Insurgent in 2015. As he wasn't the original director in Divergent, he did have a tough job taking over this project, and I personally don't think that he done an impressive job. Although the movies made quite a bit of money, and he did push the young actors to the limit, I still think that the franchise was missing originality. With that aside, I liked the drones, along with a couple of the spaceships but apart from that, there wasn't anything else that sticks out in my mind. Anyway, it was a sad ending to Tris & Four but I wouldn't be surprised if they brought back the characters in the near future.Budget: $110million Worldwide Gross: $180millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/mysteries, starring Shailene Woodley, Theo James, Jeff Daniels, Naomi Watts, Octavia Spencer, Zoe Kravitz, Ansel Elgort, Miles Teller, Ray Stevenson and Mekhi Phifer. 5/10",Allegiant
26,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"""Divergent"" series falls apart with misguided ""penultimate""installment",3,4 January 2017,"Chances are if you've made it to this third installment of the ""Divergent"" series, you're pretty 'allegiant' to Veronica Roth's teen dystopia books. Or you just like watching the sweaty shirtless backs of Shailene Woodley and Theo James. Either way, no judgment here. I voluntarily watched it.Director Robert Schwentke returns to the series after making ""Insurgent,"" which he handled with acceptable competence. In ""Allegiant,"" he gets an even lesser script to work with and can't do much of anything to counter how far-flung the story has gotten at this point — both Roth's actual story and the film's reworked version of it.With the goal of turning around these films annually, the studio turned to new writers and asked them to not only adapt the series finale, but split it up into two parts, and only write part one (as far as we know). This task, given to Adam Cooper and Bill Collage (""Exodus: Gods & Kings,"" ""The Transporter Refueled"") and Noah Oppenheim (""The Maze Runner"") — and possibly another writer who didn't end up getting a credit on the film — pretty much writes the film's death sentence. ""Allegiant"" the book has its problems, as Roth cracks open the world she intricately built in the first two books and places her characters in an almost completely new world with whole new stakes. We follow Tris (Woodley) and Four (James) as they break out into the ""fringe,"" where they eventually discover the Bureau of Genetic Welfare and learn of the circumstances that led to the development of the world they were born into. During their field trip beyond the fence, however, war looms back in the city where Evelyn's (Naomi Watts) Factionless are at odds with those clinging to the old way of life.Despite a couple different story lines and a large portion of the story that splits up Tris and Four (which no Hollywood studio would allow to happen for a significant length of screen time), there really aren't two good movies worth of material without expounding significantly. Rather than adding compelling new material, however, the script just draws out certain inevitable ""twists"" from the book and ensures the story's plot points play out in action-friendly ways. Actually, almost the entire plot of the book gets used except the ending, which is lopped off to make room for a rousing fourth movie that has no precedent in the novel.So not only is it a forced script (Jeff Daniels is awesome when he gets the dialogue, but watching him in this versus an Aaron Sorkin project is like night and day), but it deviates enough from the book to confound the only people still watching the series — the book's fans. Not a wise choice.""Insurgent"" nearly zapped the film of any character-driven elements and in ""Allegiant"" there's almost none of them. The best opportunity Woodley gets to act is a weirdly long decontamination shower scene. The script doesn't entirely lose the conflict between Tris and Four, but it's short-lived and ineffective. A plot device rather than the core of the narrative. The first-person perspective of the novels was always going to make these films difficult to adapt. It showed with ""Insurgent."" But the quality of the popcorn-munching elements drops off in ""Allegiant,"" in part due to fatigue and in part because the story doesn't resemble its former self. The story and backdrop can change if the characters' journeys stay intact, but that was already falling apart before cameras rolled on ""Allegiant.""You'll be ready to be done with the ""Divergent"" series come the end of this one, and seeing as it's the third film in a book trilogy, you kind of expect to be relieved of that burden, but alas. Whatever Lionsgate/Summit can throw together for ""Ascendant"" won't be worth watching, save for the final moments so fans can have *some* closure.~Steven CThanks for reading!

27,subxerogravity,Definitely not my favorite in the series so far.,6,18 March 2016,"For me it was weak.What I liked about the The Divergent Series, was how amazing an action adventure the whole franchise is. Is it as good as Hunger Games? no need to answer that question, but it definitely was more brutal and grim, which I'll admit I liked, and what drew me in.This movie was more story than the other two. It does a lot of explaining about the entire series. The only problem is, as it turns out the story is not that impressive. It feels like they just slap something on paper in five minutes and filmed it. Not even The appearance of Jeff Daniels in the series could save it.The little action that it did have was good, and all done by the character Tobias Eaton which kind of sucks.Because of how connected all three movies are I have to grade it as a Sequel and not a sand alone, and as a sequel it's a weak leak because it changes everything that made we want to see the movie in the first place",Allegiant
28,freemantle_uk,A series running on fumes,5,12 March 2017,"If there was a case for young adult adaptation are all the same and blend together then Allegiant can be used as evidence, borrowing elements from The Hunger Games and Maze Runner series.After the events of Insurgent the faction system has broken down after the people have found out that Chicago was no more than an experiment. Tris (Shailene Woodley) wants to see the outside world and together with her boyfriend, Four (Theo Jones), brother Caleb (Ansel Elgort), friends Christina (Zoe Kravitz), Tori (Maggie Q) and Peter (Miles Teller - the term friend is being used very loosely) go over the wall and discover a civilisation of scientific advance people lead by David (Jeff Daniels) who explains how the world felt into chaos and why Tris is so special. But, David has his own motives.I had a soft spot for the Divergent series until now: the first two films were solid films for their target audience and had some fun trippy Inception style scenes in the mindscape. Yet the good will that the series has built has spent and Allegiant used ideas from Mockingjay and The Maze Runner sequels, that people secretly exist beyond the world and they are not to be trusted whilst the desert landscape is like the one in The Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials, just with much worst CGI.Allegiant even rips off the previous films in the series. The climax is similar to what happened in the first two films, the heroes have to break into the central governmental building to stop the villain's scheme and free either friends or family. Insurgent was able to get away with this because there was enough of a different because Tris was stuck in the dreamscape to open mystery box.Allegiant relies on the characters to be idiots for the plot to continue, especially Tris who should have been more sceptical of the mysterious people who have been watching Chicago, not less. She was both the chosen saviour who had enhanced instincts yet also be incredibly gullible.The relief in Allegiant is the world fell apart was humanity split between genetically enhanced people and regular people. Basically it was a cross between Gattaca, X-Men and the Animatrix short The Second Renaissance. Humanity split into factions because the genetically enhanced got corrupted, making some virtues greater at the expense of others, making them 'damaged'. Tris is told she's the cure for the 'damaged' and like the kids in the Maze Runner series being the cure for the zombie outbreak. Even for a sci-fi film this is a stretch and Allegiant does not mitigate the criticism the series has suffered that the faction system doesn't make any sense: if anything the revelation makes the concept harder to swallow.Allegiant shows that the Divergent film series has run its course. It has run out of ideas and the low Rotten Tomatoes score and box office returns has put paid to the idea that there would be a sequel: although there would be a sense of schadenfreude to see big- name and emerging actors forced to appear in a TV movie.",Allegiant
29,stevendbeard,Good Sequel,7,18 March 2016,"I saw ""The Divergent Series:Allegiant-Part 1"", starring Shailene Woodley-The Fault in Our Stars, Crossing Jordan_tv; Theo James-Golden Boy_tv, Underworld:Awakening; Naomi Watts-St. Vincent, Eastern Promises and Jeff Daniels-The Martian, Speed.This is the 3rd of at least a 4 part franchise, with this one being divided up into a part 1 & a part 2-like the Harry Potter, Twilight and Hunger Games series did. The first one was Divergent and the second was Insurgent. I thought this was a good sequel because it actually advanced the story line and answered questions. To refresh your memory, this is sometime in the future where Chicago is an oasis in the middle of some kind of devastated wasteland, with a wall surrounding the city keeping it's citizens alive. The people are divided into different groups, depending on their personality traits; the peace lovers, the fearless, the intellectuals and the honest-I think I left out one but you get the idea. At the end of the last one Shailene and boyfriend Theo led a group in revolt against evil dictator Kate Winslet and they won, but then got a clue that more answers may lie outside the walls. Theo's mother, Naomi, has taken Kate's place inside the walls of Chicago and may be heading down a dark path to becoming just as bad as Kate was. Jeff is one of the answers lying outside the walls that Shailene and Theo find after they leave the city. Genetic engineering is another. The action sequences were pretty good-I liked the drone-type discs that were used in different ways. It's rated ""PG-13"" for action, violence and sexual content-partial nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 1 minute. I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Allegiant
30,alindsay-al,An awful young adult film that will hopefully kill his franchise,2,30 December 2016,"It's funny, when I saw divergent I actually quite liked it but then came insurgent and then came allegiant. The premise of this film sees tris and her friends escape Chicago and try an find out what is going on outside the wall. Shailene woodley plays tris in this film and I really like her as an actress but not in this film. She is very laboured in this film and really doesn't look like she cares about this film. She looks like she doesn't want to be there and that she doesn't care which makes her character incredibly dull in this film. Theo James plays four in this film and he too is very stoic in this film and their relationship just doesn't develop and you don't care about either character. Ansel elgort plays tris brother again on this film and I didn't like him at all in this film, his character was annoying and obnoxious and when he is put in harm's way I just didn't care at all. However, there are some decent performances in this film, I like miles teller as and actor and he did his best in this film to make his character fun to watch. He is the most interesting character in the film and I really hope he starts getting better films to be in. Jeff Daniels is in this film an I thought he did a good job in the film, even though his character is very cliché he manages to rise above it and give a good performance. The story is just utter trash, there is nothing of worth here at all. You have seen all the twists here and they aren't even executed well at all, You won't care about any of the emotional moments in the film or the relationships that are developed at all. The script has drama that just comes across as really badly done and make you care even less about these characters. The forced humour in the film also doesn't work at all. The style has some decent action scenes that will entertain you, but the pacing of the film is awful and really makes the film feel longer then it actually is. Overall this is an awful movie that will hopefully kill this franchise.",Allegiant
31,mattkratz,decent,7,10 December 2017,"This was an OK sequel to the Divergent series, though it kind of suffered from the movie series version of ""jumping the shark."" Once again, Shailene Woodley's performance carries the film, as does an outstanding ensemble cast and a good series of action sequences. I liked the gas being released towards the end and the people being locked in. However, there wasn't too much in terms of story. I felt like they could have done better with that. The first two films did that better. Stick to the first two films for that department. The overall series is good though.** out of ****",Allegiant
32,r96sk,Untapped potential,7,19 May 2020,"So much untapped potential, just like the previous two films.'Allegiant' is a frustrating watch. I mentioned in my review for 'Insurgent' that I liked the way that ended and hoped they'd build on it here. For the vast majority, they unfortunately don't. They do expand the world slightly which is a positive, but not nowhere near to close enough; it's basically just a stone's throw down the road.The cast are all fine, Shailene Woodley (Tris) remains the best of the bunch but no-one gives an exceptional performance sadly. Jeff Daniels is a promising addition, though he doesn't even begin to set the world alight in terms of conviction; a very one-dimensional character.No surprise to see a fourth film cancelled. Even though I don't actually mind these films in the grand scheme of things, they are certainly a disappointment as it's a helluva missed opportunity to create an outstanding franchise.",Allegiant
33,adamjohns-42575,Missing an ending.,7,16 August 2021,"All of a sudden, Tris is a badass? It's like they've suddenly ramped up her capabilities and importance. Maybe we would have seen how that happened if, as with the other two films, this third one wasn't so rushed and from what I understand it's only half of the final book, because there should have been a fourth that was never made to finish the series off. At least this one doesn't leave you hanging, but I still think it's lousy to have it left without the full ending.With the addition of a new territory, it starts to feel more like 'Star Trek/Oblivion/Elysium and Hunger Games' hybrid and it is still quite predictable.That doesn't mean it's a bad film, it just means that it's tiring to watch the same thing all the time.I will definitely have to read the books now for some closure and to see just what happens with Caleb as he has started to show that he's not really a 'Hufflepuff' after all.This ones definitely got more going for it than the first two, but I wonder how 'Divergent' it is from the original story.",Allegiant

36,Rob_Taylor,Another lackluster installment...,5,21 June 2016,"Here we go again folks. Another installment of the ludicrous Divergent series of movies. So what did I think? Well, there are a few sins that movies can make these days which automatically invite scorn. One of those is the notion that taking the last book in a series of novels and splitting it into two is a good idea. It isn't. The Hobbit proved that once and for all, yet here, the makers decided they could get away with it and not have it harm the story (laughable though it is). They failed.Another thing (and more of a personal gripe, really) is the conceit that you can put forward an all-powerful entity and then try to convince your audience that said entity is unable to fix a trifling problem. Allegiant does this with the introduction of the Pure. A technologically advanced faction of humans that has anti-gravity, camouflage holograms and all manner of science-y malarkey, yet is singularly unable to fix the human genome which is damaged, apparently.Hmmm... Where have I seen this nonsense before... Oh yes! Aeon Flux! Another movie that tried to make you swallow an advanced society that was horribly deficient in one area... medicine.Now, I'm not saying this couldn't play out, but it isn't very likely that the one technology/skill they need is the one technology/skill they are completely rubbish at.Anyway, what about the film? Is it any good? Well, it is a lot better than Interminable (or whatever the last film was called) but suffers in a lot of places.Chief among these is the tired old YA trope of ""these kids are just an experiment"" which we've seen countless times before. Add in a set of actors that aren't the best, along with clunky dialogue and yet another YA trope - adults are evil - and the stage is set for a disappointment.Shailene Woodley... Where do I start? She has an acting technique that comprises a wide-eyed stare and the conviction that she is always right. Yet you know if any of the other characters ever questioned ""Why?"" she would not have an answer. And about that wide-eyed stare... It often seemed to me as if she was channeling the cute look from Puss n Boots in an attempt to make her more endearing. All it did was make her veer into uncanny valley territory. As an actress, she is not very convincing.Then you have the really atrocious writing. Once again Peter betrays everyone, after spending most of the movie helping them. It's like he's a split-personality, yet no real reason is given for either his abrupt turn-coating or the fact that the others do little more than shrug, as if his antics are those of a cheeky schoolboy! Back to the tech that the Pure faction has... they have holograms that hide their presence, forming a wall of illusion between themselves and the outside that is so perfect. Yet when they use their ""spy-tech"" they are unable to render a stable image to the watcher? It doesn't add up.All in all, it seems more of an exercise of ""Throw crap at the screen and whatever sticks, we'll use in the movie."" This is an increasingly common attitude, especially prevalent amongst YA dystopian future movies, where, presumably, the writers don't think the audience will be switched on enough to notice the glaring inconsistencies and holes.SUMMARY: Bad story. Bad acting. Bad mumbo-jumbo techno-crap. Bad characters. Bad dialogue... Need I go on? When the best thing you can say about a movie is ""It's not quite as bad as the previous installment."" you should probably avoid it.",Allegiant
37,denis888,"This Third Part Is Not The Best, Surely It Isn't Too Bad, Either",7,11 July 2016,"I was waiting a bit longer to watch the third part of the Divergent Saga, and yes, I like the first part very very much, while the second was good, but not excellent, and thus, the third one. Well, it is 2 hours long, and yes, because of that, it tends to be a bit too slow and dragging. Plodding tempo almost ruins the movie in the first third but later the film catches up and on. Main characters are still lovable and endearing, with Tris being even sexier and Four even wilder. The biggest asset is a welcoming addition of great drama heavy Jeff Daniels as David, and he shines throughout - old school works well, I say. There are certain weaker parts in that, too, and sometimes the movie seems to be a mishmash of awesome CGI and effects but lacking sense and depth. Sometimes, sheer love for loud shooting and wild tricks overshadows the essence and ideas. This is why this part is good, yes, but not the best, and now all the hot expectation is on the last part",Allegiant
38,MuviFan73,Divergent - one hell of a ride or is it?,4,15 March 2016,"To begin with, I would like to first mention that this is a 3 movie review. Divergent very true to its name describes a person altogether different from main stream audience. I liked the idea of placement of people in various categories based on an aptitude.The idea of a divergent seems to match with someone who is enlightened, a person very rare to found but not impossible to exist. The second movie does justice to this idea, as a divergent is the one to unlock the secrets of creator.Creation of an aptitude and related environment happens to be one hell of a job but who knows we might be on a ride to create one. What I expected in this movie was... the divergent become in some way related to creators. There is an idea of afterlife in every culture... it felt as if divergent were heading in that direction, but the standard of entire series degraded with introduction of idea of killing the ones that are not pure breed by creators. I am sorry guys it was disappointing. N s I read no books n saw no trailer.Rating : 6.0/10",Allegiant
39,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A film that should be a strong finish to an OK series.,4,8 March 2019,"For those following along at home, Allegiant is the third film based on the third book in the Divergent series. As I have made comparisons to The Hunger Games in each installment of these reviews, I will continue to not disappoint. Seems to me that the trend of splitting the last book of a literary series into two movies is annoyingly out of hand. Sure, having written the end of my own trilogies, I know there's a lot of plot and sub-plots to bring to a conclusion. I also know that much of the Divergent series didn't feel like it really did or said anything. Sure, there's the nod to some political statement or worldview that's relevant today, but honestly I want something that only the survivors of a post-apocalyptic future should have to solve.Where the previous two films in this series really excelled in their portrayal of ""simulations"", this film had absolutely none of them. This was a problem, mainly because the strength of the previous two films relied on the characters growing through their overcoming of the simulations. In this film, there seems to be no character development at all (and annoying Peter (Miles Teller) is still around), and even the CGI, which was pretty good in the prior films, felt flat and obvious (even to the point of being distracting). Sorry, Robert Schwentke, but this was not your best work.Similarly, while this film does stop at a good place to allow the ""part 2"" conclusion to wrap up next year, I still feel lost as to what is happening and who the clear antagonist of this whole post-apocalyptic future is (which is a problem I had with the last movie). Maybe once I read the book this was based on I'll be able to give a better assessment, but for right now I'm pretty much done with this series.In a film that should be a strong finish to an OK series, I give Allegiant 2.0 stars out of 5.",Allegiant

Tris, Four, Christina(Zoe Kravitz), Caleb(Ansel Elgort) & Peter(Miles Teller) go beyond the wall in Chicago, to explore what lies outside the confines of their city. Here, they meet Romit(Andy Bean), who takes them to an outpost led by, David(Jeff Daniels). Tris & her companions soon realize, that everything is not what it seems to be. Allegiant is a good film. The suspense element in this film, is a welcome addition that wasn't present in either Divergent(2014) or Insurgent(2015). Apart from this, the previous two installments in The Divergent Series are way better. The main ingredient this movie is missing, is an intimidating & memorable antagonist. Kate Winslet's character Jeanine, is dearly missed. The visual effects are great. The production design is superb. The way the art department has envisioned a dystopian Chicago & all the other places in the movie, is awe inspiring. The performances are effective but, nothing to write home about. Shailene Woodley is brilliant as Tris. Theo James is superb as Four. Naomi Watts is awesome as Evelyn. Octavia Spencer is amazing as Johanna Reyes. Jeff Daniels gives an average performance as David. Jeff Daniels' David is nowhere near as spectacular as Kate Winslet's Jeanine. Zoe Kravitz is good as Christina. Ansel Elgort is effective as Caleb. Miles Teller is mind blowing as Peter. Teller's character, is the only comic relief in the entire film. Keiynan Lonsdale, Daniel Dae Kim, Maggie Q, Bill Skarsgard, Jonny Weston, Nadia Hilker & Andy Bean are impressive as Uriah, Jack Kang, Tori, Matthew, Edgar, Nita & Romit, respectively. Allegiant is worth a watch for fans of this franchise. Go for it but, don't keep your expectations too high.",Allegiant
41,fernandoschiavi,"Allegiant has good intentions, but fails to deliver a more compelling story, with consequences and strong dramatic moments",6,14 March 2021,"While Divergent, the first film in the saga, held the ends, with a reasonable dramatic level and with a focus of interest in the presentation of the futuristic and dystopian world in which the teenager Beatrice lives, or just Tris (Shailene Woodley), divided into factions; while the second part, Insurgent, proved to be the best of the three by investing more in the psychological of its protagonist and in a slightly cruder, darker footprint; the third feature, which as well as the book could - indeed, should - be the last, brings up what, deep down, could be seen from the beginning.The plot shows the continuation of a war inside Chicago and the search for Tris and Co. for answers beyond the Wall. The first half hour serves to recap everything that happened before - if someone has not followed the story so far it will not be long before they learn about what happened. If in Divergent, Tris and Four are estranged until they are together, in Insurgent the attraction gets stronger and stronger, to the point of making them inseparable. Unlike the Twilight or Hunger Games plots, there is no room for a love triangle here. If this can be understood as a minimal attempt to differentiate yourself from the competition, on the other hand it eliminates any kind of tension and doubt. Thus, the maximum that Allegiant can offer is a momentary separation: Tris decides to believe and embrace her condition of being genetically pure, while Four will continue to be suspicious of everything and everyone until she glimpses the real intentions of those around her. It won't be long before we find out which one is right.Written in six hands by Noah Oppenheim (""Maze Runner""), Adam Cooper and Bill Collage (the last two from ""Exodus - Gods and Kings""), the script is one of the weakest points of this ""The Divergent Series - Convergent"", although it is far from the film's only problem. The future here goes as far as the modest budget allows, full of colors and chrome buildings, which, if well executed, do not compromise the ambience of the script. From there a predictable web of conspiracies is formed and Tris (Shailene Woodley) begins to follow the path that will end the story of the apocalypse created by Veronica Roth. Like its predecessors, Robert Schwantke's film lacks strength in the protagonists' drama, a couple without chemistry and a sense of urgency for the cause they fight for - something that turns the plot into something banal, robbing the force of any suggested discussion.If until now the series and all its characters showed that Tris was an intelligent and determined warrior, that goes down the drain in the first two acts of this production. Shailene Woodley's character is easily manipulated and completely devoid of any personality from the moment she enters the Department and falls for David. As talented as Woodley is, it is difficult for the interpreter to sell the heroine here, especially because her actions contradict everything we knew about the girl. Wasted, the girl delivers a performance on autopilot, lifeless and dull, with Tris being more concerned with getting a new father figure than paying attention to what happens around her. The protagonist does not even win an opponent at the level of the late Jeanine. If in the scenes in ""Divergent"" and ""Insurgent"", Shailene and Kate Winslet fought good duels, thanks to the determination that verged on the villain's insanity, here she is replaced by David, an antagonist who has no definite plan.Unlike the protagonists of the series, Allegiant does not have anything audacious. The film tries to please all types of viewers, but ends up getting lost in the intention and flows with a plot that lacks intelligence. Without the film explaining exactly what the ""pure"" and ""damaged"" preached by David are, his motivations fade away, making the villain as empty as his holograms. Representing the new antagonist of the series, Jeff Daniels (Lost on Mars) is the great addition to the cast, replacing the late character of Kate Winslet. David (Jeff Daniels) waits for Tris in a complex outside the wall, located at O'Hare International Airport, and reveals to him that the earth came into conflict after a discovery that it is possible to change the genetics of humanity, which resulted in a great war that decimated a good part of the population of the planet. Even with the war, they carried out the change in the human genome, where it allowed each one to choose their psychological guidelines, which ended up not working entirely as expected, so the remnants of the changes were isolated in the city of Chicago, to be observed in order to find a way to make the ""damaged"" into ""pure"" human beings.Equally unexplained is the conflict between Evelyn and Johanna (Octavia Spencer), in addition to the silliness of Edgar (Jonny Weston), Evelyn's henchman who made me miss Jai Courtney's nastiness in the previous two features. The one who is saved here (but not by much) is Theo James, as his Four is the only proactive hero in the adventure, taking the place that was Tris in previous stories. Miles Teller makes his dubious Peter work even if in a caricatured way, but it is inexplicable that someone at this point in the story still trusts the character's character. Ansel Elgort remains stuck with a repentant Caleb and Zoë Kravitz, with virtually no role in history.With a minimal budget to mix urban, post-apocalyptic dystopia and a pseudo-futuristic world, ""The Divergent Series - Convergent"" certainly has one of the most unimaginative visuals in the franchise besides weak visual effects, seeming unfinished at various times. The Margin desert is so fake that it never convinces how dangerous (something unforgivable in a world after ""Mad Max - Fury Road"") and the ""advanced"" architecture of the Department and the city of Providence can only be tacky and ineffective. These are factors that, again, work for the moment, but lose their strength when they are conceptually left aside, believing that merely satisfying the audience with a minimum of visual enchantment will suffice. I do not know if much of the blame lies with director Robert Schwentke, who, apart from the shallow exploration of production design in plain view, makes little effort to push his action scenes beyond the bureaucratic limit.When it goes into action, however, the film shows all its youthful (and artificial) vein - from silly catch phrases to the toy noise that each weapon makes when firing a shot. The second act, where the problems of the last part of the saga are presented, this characteristic is more evident. Everything is chewed up and expressed in subtle words so that the whole meaning of Tris's struggle is clear. ""Don't separate people"", ""don't divide us into groups"" and other buzzwords, obvious in the narrative, are repeated to exhaustion unnecessarily. The action in Convergent sounds rather shallow, almost childish. There are many scenes, for example, in which the characters develop novels amid climax points in the story, increasing the surreal aspect - and this is not a compliment - of what is happening on the screen. Some shots seem to be designed to please fans, repeating almost ipsis litteris the contents of the book that gives rise to the plot (the famous fan service). Fair enough, in the case of such a famous literary saga, but it causes some discomfort from the moment that it hinders the paced pace of the work. At one point, director Robert Schwentke delivers here some of the weakest action scenes in the franchise, constantly using shock to try to keep the audience awake - see the practically wired death of a certain character at the end of the first act. There is a scene in which a vehicle appears in the desert that is absolutely indefensible, even from a plastic point of view.Allegiant has good intentions, but fails to deliver a more compelling story, with consequences and strong dramatic moments. Although there are excellent actors in the cast, none of them manage to impose themselves or overcome the didacticism of the script. On the other hand, the film delivers an honestly divided plot, with a well-constructed climax and an ending that leaves hooks (for an ending that never occurred), but does not give up on ending a story - unlike other sister franchises. In the end, Allegiant is a film that tries to talk about revolution and change, but that, deep down, remains attached to the conventions of the industry and the genre, since it underestimates the viewer with obvious resolutions, bets on loving scenes that do not advance in the narrative and so it wastes great actors like Octavia Spencer, Naomi Watts and Jeff Daniels and spoils any relationship we can have with their characters.With special effects below what had already been seen in previous chapters, the negligence of those involved in Allegiant resulted in what should be expected: a sharp drop in worldwide revenue, which meant that the studio simply canceled the last part of the series in theaters. . First it was thought to drastically reduce the budget and launch the last part directly to television, but time passed and after several impasses, the series achieved the feat and did not serve the role, leaving it (for more problems that it showed the three previous films) unfinished, frustrating everyone who had been insisting on following the series since the beginning, especially Tris fans and their friends. Unfortunately, Divergent will be remembered for being a blockbuster series that never ended.",Allegiant
42,dave-mcclain,"""Allegiant"" brings forward the series' strong story, but does so with a weak script.",5,18 March 2016,"Divide and conquer – the box office, that is. The pattern should be familiar to Movie Fans and book worms alike (especially to people who are both). Take a popular YA book series and make the books into movies, but spread the final book's story over two films. This was done in adapting the ""Twilight"" and ""Hunger Games"" books and then ""The Divergent Series"" followed suit. Of course, it was the same production company behind that decision in those first two examples that made the decision for that third film series as well, but the ""Harry Potter"" film series had already set the precedent by turning the seventh Potter book into a two-film extravaganza. In fact, 2013 is the only year between 2010 and 2017 without (in spirit if not in name) a ""Part 1"" or ""Part 2"" of some YA film series finale in American theaters.""The Divergent Series: Allegiant"" (PG-13, 2:01) represents the first half of ""Allegiant"", the final book in Veronica Roth's ""Divergent"" trilogy (with the second half of ""Allegiant"" hitting the big screen as ""The Divergent Series: Ascendant"" in June 2017). In the case of those final two YA book to movie series, ""The Hunger Games"" and the ""Divergent Series"", you could say ""four is the new three"". And after seeing the third ""Divergent"" film, ""The Divergent Series: Allegiant"", it could also be said that Four is the new Tris.""Allegiant"" picks up almost immediately after Evelyn Johnson-Eaton (Naomi Watts) takes over for Jeanine Matthews (Kate Winslet) as ruler of post-apocalyptic Chicago by putting a bullet in Jeanine's brain. Now, Jeanine's minions are on trial for aiding and abetting her murderous abuse of power. The faction system which prevailed in the city during the series up to this point is now defunct, but a new rift has formed in this dystopian society – between those who want nothing more than to live in peace – and those who still want to fight to force their will on all the people. Evelyn represents that latter group and Johanna Reyes (Octavia Spencer) represents the former. Our favorite young divergent, Tris (Shailene Woodley), aligns herself more closely with Johanna, but is more interested in finding out what is beyond the city walls and she's hoping that her lover and fellow divergent, Four (Theo James) will come with.Like Jeanine before her (although for different reasons), Evelyn is committed to keeping everyone within the city walls, at least for the time being. Tris isn't willing to wait. With the help of Four, Christina (Zoë Kravitz) and Tori (Maggie Q), and with the duplicitous Peter (Miles Teller) and Tris' brother, Caleb (Ansel Elgort), in tow (each having been forgiven for his previous betrayals), Tris makes a run for it. Although hotly pursued by Edgar (Jonny Weston), Evelyn's most loyal and ruthless lieutenant, Tris and company manage to make it to a previously unknown futuristic city inhabited by those who originally set up the faction system and orchestrated that grand social experiment from which Tris' group has just escaped.Tris and friends settle into their new home and start jobs serving the government. David (Jeff Daniels), the Director of the Bureau of Genetic Welfare, takes a personal interest in Tris. He convinces her that she is personally and uniquely able to help him reverse the genetic tampering that was done before the war that destroyed most of the planet two centuries earlier. It's nothing less than an opportunity to save mankind. Tris is a bit wary, but she wants to help. This time, Four is the one who is the rebel and refuses to go along with the program. He's jealous of David monopolizing Tris' time, but he also just doesn't trust David. With the help of Matthew (Bill Skarsgård), one of David's assistants, Four gets the chance to test his suspicions and try to change the course of events before something (else) really bad happens.With ""The Divergent Series: Allegiant"", the film series is showing some serious cracks. The visual effects, acting and overall story remain strong and I remain enthusiastic about the series' underlying message of tolerance and acceptance of personal differences, but the script in this third film has really gone off the rails. This movie doesn't have as much fresh action as the other films in the series (similar to ""The Hunger Games: Girl on Fire""), but the script's big problems lie in its plot points and dialog. We see heroes as well as villains trust each other when it's obvious they shouldn't, and they say and do things that just don't make sense given who these characters are and what they're doing to pursue their goals.I can't get very specific and still avoid spoilers, but here are some general examples of what I mean: If you don't want people to see what's going on in a certain location, don't give them complete access to your surveillance system! If you don't want your superiors to know what's really happening on your watch, don't introduce them to the one person who is most interested and willing to tell them the truth! And if people tell you they're stealing your space ship – believe them! Here's hoping that those obvious cracks in ""Allegiant"" don't turn into fissures in the final film and do to this series what the greed and selfishness in the series' story did to the great city of Chicago.

43,MihaiSorinToma,A disappointing finale for a good series,6,6 June 2018,"After the message received at the end of the second instalment, Tris and Four agree that they must travel beyond the wall and discover what awaits them there. Together with a group of friends, they venture into the unknown, while what they're about to find out is very surprising, to say the least.In this third and also last part of the Divergent series, we follow the protagonists as the begin to understand the truth about their city, the wall and their ancestors. As expected, not everything will prove to be as pleasant as it seems, so they will soon find themselves in a position which asks for immediate action.Unfortunately, as it has become quite a habit when it comes to franchises, if the first move is good or a success, the others that will follow will have a quite steep tendency of losing essence, thus being worse. The same can be said about this one as well. What they discover and most of the explanations given are the only interesting part of this one, the rest often leaving the impression that it is there only as a filler. The main characters' implication is drastically reduced, especially when it comes to Tris', making them seem like spectators in the plot, rather than main contributors.Speaking of the plot, it is mediocre at best and it only manages to generate suspense a bit in the beginning until the great mystery is unfold. Afterwards, it falls into the predictable and obvious trap from where it just won't rise again. You get to care about the characters less as times goes by, leaving the viewer to wait for the finale without a true feeling. There are also quite a few plot holes and unexplainable phenomenon but it is to be expected considering the overall quality.I cannot understand what happened with the whole awesomeness, emotion, drama, action and suspense from the first instalment. How could they have deviated so much from the original formula, which I consider great, and end up with this one. To be honest, if it wasn't for the suspense generated by its predecessors and its still impressive CGI, it would have been an awful movie.As I see it now, it managed to be quite average, even below, ending the series quite disappointingly from my point of view. You're left with an average movie which could have been a lot better from many points of view, especially the plot, as the series deserved.",Allegiant

Theo and Shailene were once again terrific as Four and Tris. The CGI wasn't the best but it still added a cool element to the story. The scenery was interesting and caught my eye.

What to be, think and do different is something good. Although later it is framed in a format of science fiction that goes to much to the effects and still, it is not based on a final fight without barracks based on effects and does not go crazy.He tells the story, how can we be confused, but in the end we can and must fix it. Let people decide what they want.Being the same director of the first one and nevertheless it has surpassed in its form to direct, it was not difficult. The other counted the same thing but in the end if he went with the fight. In this case it is better managed and the camera better knows. The effects are great and are very well made.

I for one wasn't bored and comparing it to the awful Hunger games Mockingjay part 2 which really did send me to sleep, I thought Allegiant was very good.Maybe it helps that I have never read the books because many of those that didn't like this movie had read them and I know movies of books are often disappointing.Was a shame Maggie Q got killed off so early and I think she was underused in this movie.

It's really poorly done, bad CGI and stuff. And where the story from the books was at times confusing, this was downright dumb and mad no sense. The biggest book-moments were cut out, probably to make room for the bad CGI... I kind of expected it to be bad, 'cause the 2nd one wasn't that good either. It also seems the actors get less and less convincing with each movie. Contrary to the Hunger Games (that also differed from the books somewhat, but functional imho), these don't live up to the books at all. If you read them, don't watch the movies.

49,in1984,The Best and Only Sci-fi Divergent Yet,8,26 May 2016,"8 of 10. The series keeps getting better and it finally becomes science fiction as opposed to just a dystopian alternate reality.The first thing you need to do to fully enjoy this is not read the reviews and especially not the reviews of the book readers. The books may or may not be better. Harry Potter sucks no matter what. The Lord of the Rings is only good if you're a kid who hasn't read anything but a bible, Greek mythology, Dracula, or some other weak horror and fantasy.Here we have a series that seems like little more than imitation Hunger Games complete with an imitation blond girl, but as it turns out, there's more too it and, finally, actual sci-fi.The first 2 films act as a setup for what and why there is a dystopia in addition to not providing any science fiction, so this pays off the way a mystery book with a long plot does, even if the want-to-be book reviewers haven't read enough to develop the needed attention span to put this trilogy together.",Allegiant
50,James_De_Bello,4/10,4,9 March 2016,"I will not blame anyone who has given up hope with this franchise and passed on checking out this. I went because I am Sheilene Woodley's number one fan and supporter (check my reviews of her films for proof on that), so anything she does I will see, included this franchise which for me, in the first two entries, proved to be a mix of some few good elements, Woodley's performance being center on that, with some bad filmaking overall and a story that was always so bad it made me laugh.That element is partially back, once again through the entirety of the duration of the film almost nothing makes sense. The story is just so bol*ocks I am inclined to laugh at it. Yet this time around I didn't even manage to do that. It just makes no sense whatsoever, nothing that is going on on screen is ever motivated, but even worse, it doesn't fit with the other two films and just emerges as an absolute mess.Even Shailene Woodley who in the past managed to elevate the non sense that was going around her, with the help of Theo James' charisma, can't do anything with this material. She isn't bad in anyway, it would be impossible for her, but no one on screen manages to make heads or toes of their character, simply because their isn't anything to be understood, it is just a screenplay that mixes random exposition to ever changing motivations because the story requires it. Even the cinematography, for the most part, is as dull as it can be: basic coverage of dialogue scenes and where it tries to do something new like some good tracking shots it fails miserably because they look terrible.What remains good is the imagery that the series has offered throughout, don't misunderstand me: for the major part the CGI is mediocre and touches bad in many points, but the art concepts and the visual ideas still work very well and provide that minimum flare that mixed to some laughing at the story and Miles Teller not giving a sh*t for the third time, which I must admit is the best part of the film, manages to get you through the film indifferently.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless you are a true fan of the series, the film in itself is boring and uninspired with yet another laughable ending.",Allegiant
51,scottshak_111,What a rock-bottom!,6,14 April 2016,"Allegiant is a big bummer! From the enthralling tales that were so successfully luring us towards its nail-biting enclaves, comes another one, a rather dismissive twist that takes the plot to weird levels of alcoves from where there is no possible return. The movie franchise has met an ugly thud and now we are left with a stale taste in our palate. We are thinking can someone really revive this? Just an year ago, Robert Schwentke had wrapped us a thrilling sequel to the first part where things seemed really promising. It was a fast paced dig, au contraire, to the first instalment and acquainted us to a fantastical world of simulations. I don't know how his direction degraded for Allegiant to meet complete chaos.The fact that we had a pre-written storyline in our baggage should have actually helped not played against Schwentke. His direction goes dodgy at so many occasions that it is hard to just pinpoint one. Also, the plot jack-hammers into a recess that we weren't really expecting it to converge into. Even though it was supposed to be from Veronica Roth's perspective, we could have used some better helming to ease into some mind-numbing revelations. The shoddy display at points where it mattered the most proves how little director cared about its eye-openers.SPOILERS AHEAD: What messed with matters further was the film's dramatic quotient. The fact that Tori got lost amidst a ruckus, and the next-to-absent ""Evelyn and Johanna Reyes war"" made things even worse. Jeff Daniels played a great David although his hands seemed more tied and his perversion not milked enough.Sometimes I think it is almost time to hand over the reins of the franchise into hands of a better TV show director. We could really use a better insight. Can watch it if you are inquisitive enough to know what happened next.",Allegiant
52,fciocca,"Luckily, they decided to stop to make movies of this series",4,17 October 2019,"I watched the complete trilogy, to understand why these movies few years back were so popular. I don't like judging something, without watching it before, so I have decided to take the painful decision to waste 6 hours of my time (2 hours per movie).I reviewed also the previous two chapters and the weakest point is always the acting. Shailene Woodley is simply not cutted to be an actress, and after three movies, I think I have the right to say so: she is not expressive at all, you cannot bound or even feel something for her character. In all three chapters she has the same exact face from the beginning until the end. And she is one of the lead actresses. Theo James was slightly better this time (maybe because he was less present in the movie), but still not an acceptable performance as main character. The rest of the cast was not better, and unfortunately this time no Kate Winslet was available to patch things up.The story is nothing extraordinary, but this time the narration expanded, and after two chapters setted in Chicago, we finally get to see what there is beyond the wall. There was an improvement in CGI effects: I really liked the representation of the apocalyptic world, and of course The Bureau and Providence cities. At least this time they've used the green screen properly. Also action scenes and stunts were good, I wish they had the same quality in the other two movies too.Do I suggest this series? Absolutely not. This is some wannabe Sci Fi for young teenager, that don't even know what Science Fiction is. The open ending of this title was clearly meant for a sequel, that luckily was never made (and let's hope that they will never make).",Allegiant

But apparently the critics and kiddies weren't intelligent enough to have fun and how it also challenges our screwed up social order. Watch it. You'll enjoy it compared the the trash we've seen recently.

It's the kind of music you want to put on a playlist and listen to when you're at the gym because it gets you pumped. The plot is also the most exciting of all the films as well. There is one problem I have with the film, though, and that is Miles Teller's acting. He was terrible in the other movies in the series, he was terrible in ""Fantastic Four,"" and he's terrible here. He tries to be the comic relief, but it just comes off as bland and trying too hard. It's like watching Hayden Christianson in the ""Star Wars"" prequels. The villains in the movie are also kind of weak. They could have been written a lot better. But, it's a fun action movie with a great score, and I'm excited to see the conclusion of the series next year.

55,themadmovieman,I'm fed up of the Divergent series now...,4,12 March 2016,"I didn't think much of the first two Divergent films at all, but they did have some moments of fun and/or intrigue from time to time. However, Allegiant, the third instalment, takes the series to a whole new low, by presenting a tedious and non-sensical story filled with poor performances, ugly visuals and disappointing directing.There was pretty much nothing I liked about Allegiant, and I want to talk about what I really couldn't bear most of all: the plot. Up to this point, the Divergent series has been superbly average. A rip- off of The Hunger Games it may be, but it's still managed to provide the world with a few positives, mainly in the shape of Shailene Woodley, as well as a light, simple story arc that you can enjoy if you turn your brain right off.In this film, however, everything suddenly becomes a lot more serious and unnecessarily complex. Whilst continuing the frustrating habit of using too much of its world's vocabulary (which is still pretty difficult to grasp three films in), Allegiant never seems to want you to have any fun. There are a couple of action scenes, but they're too far near the end, and pretty underwhelming anyway.Instead, it's basically two hours of trying to advance the series into something more meaningful than a simple young adult sci-fi, like The Hunger Games did very successfully, but it simply comes off as a drab, poorly-written mess. Attempting to introduce political notions about genetic modification and impoverished nations (but failing significantly), there's nothing in Allegiant to grab onto and enjoy, because it just takes itself too seriously, but doesn't provide the dramatic heft needed for that vibe to work out.There are a heap of other problems here too, namely with the performances. Kate Winslet managed to get out whilst she still could, but the remaining actors here all echo exactly what I felt like watching this film: bored out of their minds. Even Shailene Woodley, whose Hollywood career was really kicked into action by this series, looks fed up, rarely cracking a smile and mumbling her gibberish dialogue throughout.Just like Divergent and Insurgent, there are a lot of A-list actors in here, including Naomi Watts, Octavia Spencer, Jeff Daniels and Miles Teller, but none of them give a performance that looks like they care about what's going on. It's not their fault that this is such a dull story to have to act out, but I'm just pointing out that they don't do much to really improve it even one bit.Finally, I want to talk about the visuals in Allegiant. The first two films have had a very drab and boring colour palette, consisting mainly of grey backdrops, grey outfits, and grey greyness (apart from some scenes in Insurgent which deserve credit), but the third film's attempts to rectify it backfire horribly.If you're a grey fan, there's no need to worry, because there's still a lot of dull imagery here, but what's most painful to look at is the horrible reddish-purpley landscape outside the walls of Chicago. Made worse by heaps of ugly CGI, I was really turned off this film by the atrocious-looking landscape, and it made the film, which I was already not enjoying at all, that little bit more unpleasant.",Allegiant
56,austin0731,a solid take on the 'YA' genre,4,18 March 2016,"So as we all know the divergent series is supposedly the new 'Hunger Games', in that sense I can see that its doing great at replicating the steady downfall that the hunger games series clearly had. Yes, this isn't a great movie, its not bad it's a solid film.Now I did enjoy the movie non the less, I really liked the new sci- fi elements with the whole world outside of Chicago idea. It had good performances, action sequences and some average special effects. If you're a fan of the series, it would be great. In the sense that it is basically the same movie for the third time. It's true, I can't tell the difference.It lacks identity and individuality, now if we compare this to the Hunger games we would notice large differences, from this point of view. For each hunger games there was a clear difference in tone and theme. In my opinion each were solid in and of its own. Now granted the last two hunger games weren't really near the standards to the first two films. They all have their own individuality.Now focusing back on insurgent(see I'm even getting the names wrong, they're so alike), I would say that Shailene Woodley and Theo James were really quite well portrayed and the relationship between Tris and Four are well established and not just completely ridiculous. Another honorable mention would be Miles Teller, he's Mr. fant4stic, he's the whiplash guy and now he plays a perfect asshole, just as he has done so well in the past of this series.All in all, Allegiant was enjoyable but predictable. However personally the action, acting and sci-fi elements sold me. A perfect definition of mediocre.",Allegiant
57,fluffset,I never read the novel and completely know everything from the start!?,3,10 July 2016,"I don't like this series now because of this part, I quite like the first one but I always thought this is just some hunger game type of movie. OK, from the start, this whole movie is so boring, the only good people that ever exist is Johanna. Why Johanna and Evelyn must fight, its feel weird after everything they've been through with Jeanine. And Naomi Watts just become another Jeanine. Then, I already know there is something wrong with ""outside"", I already know that everyone except Kris and the gang are the bad guy. Its too obvious, too cliché. Same with the final installment of hunger game. I know that ""clever"" Kris will be lied by the ""outside"" and someone must save her. Same thing happen again and again, its not a twist at all, its called ""expected"". I don't know what to type anymore, and I'm proud of myself because I don't need to read a novel to know everything. So, lets wait for the next episode, where they fight with the Outsider and they win successfully with a flying colors!",Allegiant
58,FelipeCarrillo,"""This Saga Definitely Goes From Worse to Worse""",5,17 March 2016,"""Insurgent"" was witnessed the truth revealed in the dystopian city of Chicago, now ""Allegiant"" is divided into two parts (thanks) and this time we will finally discover who is beyond the wall, excited? Sorry but the discouragement will come very soon. After an intriguing and almost perfect start (first 10 minutes) emotion descends to an abysmal speed. ""Allegiant"" is the adaptation of the third and last part (except for ""Four: A Story Collection"") best-seller preferred by young people and adults written by the novelist Veronica Roth. The thrill of another big franchise of juvenile literature (The Hunger Games) has already disappeared, so it's time that other successful saga filled that void. Many secrets are revealed but not in the way in which the reading audience and film wanted.Tris (Shailene Woodley), Four (Theo James) and his friends (Miles Teller, Zoe Kravitz, etc) decide to discover that there are outside and after some shooting, a stupid death and nothing more, they succeed, It's... They run and find a road, after a chase and a beautiful strange rain arrive at your new home (Wink). The film can not move satisfactorily and its stagnation is inevitable, forgetting its future promising and intriguing.As usual in the previous films, its main dramatic core is the revelation of a truth or a death, this time open the scene of red Earth with a cinematically so poor and so unnecessary death that showed fatigue and exhaustion of the director for not making more adaptations and disappoint and anger the entire audience, all.After this fatal and horrible error, we see how is the abroad. I think that this is time where ""Summit Entertainment"" and ""Lionsgate"" already have reaped profit and enough money to provide us a few sequels with visual quality, unfortunately the outside seemed to be a prospect of ""Jupiter Ascending"" with futuristic touches, it was funny see the changing of the atmosphere of Chicago (it was quite realistic) of the abroad with radiation. Sci-fi films have a lot of work in the visual part since if they do not give credulity and eloquence with its environments the story drops off precipitously.Another one of the main attractive that had juvenile hearings for the saga was its exciting sequences of action by Tris and Four, this installment did not have nothing action, tasked raise all narrative history aside from that emotion and war that we were used. It is harassing and annoying the harmless and silly conflict internal in Chicago, after the departure of Tris and Four, sorry but I hear laughs as the film progressed.Analogically, ""Allegiant"" is like a famous reality American show which airs weekly, but this reality show already this very exhausted and burned so they decide to get to the end, all the chips are already in place, so spectators until next week to learn the fate of the dystopian world. It could maybe happen as ""Mockingjay Part One and Two"" where the first disappointed and worried fans but the second recovered what was lost and closed the franchise in the best way, we dream, is the only thing we can do.This doesn't feel like Tris, this doesn't feel like ""Divergent"", I think that it's necessary completion of the saga (Ascendant), more pain there can be no. Suddenly this strategy of divide it into two installments was a dirty move of the study to only make more money before the end. It was the decision of the director ( Robert Schwentke) to reject the last part since the job done just right and enough, a frightening close we don't want, we want something that is worthwhile. All these unknowns will be solved in June 2017 with ""Ascendant"" end. Only is expected a good outcome for our reality show because not only Chicago is destroying itself, the same movie is doing it.",Allegiant
59,nezbitkn2,What's all the negativity for?!,7,3 July 2020,"So the matrix, hunger games and twilight all differed from the first film to the last as the story unfolds! Why should this be any different?! If you can't follow the plot then watch it again until you do. It's pretty simple to be honest and in my opinion a great third (first part) chapter. The problem is money hungry fat cats deciding to split the final part of the trilogy to make more money for themselves. Greed is the reason this franchise has stalled/""failed"". I'm gutted I won't get to see a final part as I enjoyed how this film ended on a cliffhanger. Either way, I enjoyed watching the films and Woodley is kinda hot on the eye too. What a babe. Girl next door meets superwoman. Hopefully as fans we'll get some closure at some point money hungry fools realise it's not all about them but the people watching. It is how they make a living after all.",Allegiant
60,michaelhirakida,The Best One Yet! Allegiant is as close to perfect as Dystopian movies can get!,9,17 March 2016,"Me and my Sister, who is a fan of the Divergent Series, made our way into an advanced showing of Allegiant tonight at 7:00pm. I was filled with excitement to know another Divergent movie was coming out and I couldn't wait to continue the adventures of Tris and Four.The movie blew my expectations away.This is the best Divergent movie yet, it's as close to perfect as a Dystopia can get and it's right up there with The Giver. Fans will surely love it but critics will probably not enjoy it as much as they don't know much about the series. The movie has a 36 on Metacritic I think? But I wasn't bothered by the reviews. Anyways, Tris, Four, Caleb, Christina and Peter make their way out of Chicago and beyond the wall where they are found by a bureau who wants to cure damaged people (AKA The People of Chicago) by using a serum that will wipe out all their memories. Unfortunately, Four and Tris are not into that plan so it's up to them and the rest of the gang to stop David from Blinding Evelyn into using the serum on the rest of Chicago. I became a fan of Divergent when the first movie came out. Then I became more of a bigger fan when Insurgent came out. Allegiant hits all the right buttons to make a exciting and fun movie with a point about dividing races and people into groups. Allegiant uses clichés and makes them new, the predictability is there, but invisible, the story is unoriginal, but fresh. It breathes a whole new life into a film that has already been done before and it's one of it's greatest strengths. Shaliene Woodley still continues to be a better actress then Jennifer Lawrence in The Hunger Games Movies. Again as I was talking about in my Insurgent Review, she is an actress who just want to make movies for the fun of it. Not to win any sort of award, just to act, please audiences and hopefully gain a fan base. She is successful on all levels. The characters are even better than before. I love Peter (Miles Teller) He is likable, a joker, a funny-man, a confused man, a man who is lied to, who is tricked, who is selfish, it's a completely three dimensional character. Speaking of which, all the characters I found to be completely three, if not four dimensional.Allegiant is bigger than the last two films, having being set in two places, The Outside World where we have the bureau and Providence and Chicago. The designs of Providence and the Bureau are absolutely stunning, some of the sets even have some sort of symbolism. The visuals are great with Providence being the film's high point in special effects.Last but not least, the movie is very, very intelligent. The film has a great message, it has relationships that are never one sided, it has the ability to be brave, it never stops there. Allegiant right now is my favorite movie of 2016 and the definitive Spring Break Movie for Youths who want to see outstanding film- making. Director Robert Schwentke leaves us before the final film Ascendant, but he manages to make the story even better than it already was. Allegiant is a must see.93/100 A-",Allegiant
61,iantrader,Not again...,2,6 November 2016,"Hey ho and ho hum... Perhaps it's me and YA novels and movies, or perhaps it's just a so-so movie, but this was sooooo disappointing. The direction is OK and the production values are high - I really like the futuristic bits even though some viewers have complained that it's overdone - but the pacing is tedious and the plot slow, even with all the exposition. Or perhaps because of it.I do like to follow series when I can although it's so long since I saw the previous installment, I can barely remember the plot. However, you do get a few seconds of voice-over at the beginning to remind you and, really, that's all you need.The most boring parts of the movie (er, which is much of it) are where the heroine is in danger or being chased and you just know that nothing bad will happen so what's the point. There is a nice touch fairly early on where one of the main characters (at least I thought he/she was/was going to be main) dies but that little edge is lost or forgotten. The obligatory asshole is annoying and exactly what you expect so no surprises there. Are they trying to teach stereotypes or what?The concept is interesting but much the same as The Hunger Games and The Maze Runner (who's been reading whose books, then?) but the movie totally fails to make the best of it.Slow, boring, derivative. Maybe I should avoid the YA market but oh for some good, intelligent SF/F...",Allegiant
62,snperera,such a great film!,8,2 March 2017,I know people have their opinions about these movies...but I love them because there fun and energetic and they are very entertaining.

63,danielharden,The Hungry Maze Series: Detergent,2,7 April 2016,"Hunger Games mark 2, better know as The Divergent series is one of many YA movie series that aim to profit off the back of the success of such film series like The Hunger Games and Harry Potter. Allegiant is the third film in this franchise based off a book trilogy, and is sadly and illogically not the last.The acting in these movies is what you would expect from a YA series. Phone in acting performances by good actors and just bad acting from everyone else. Shailene Woodley has clearly gone to the Jennifer Lawrence school of how to phone it in for a blockbuster franchise, being quite frankly forgettable in this film even when she is the lead. Joining Naomi Watts and Octavia Spenser we have Jeff Daniels on screen, jumping aboard this shipwreck for a one-for-the-money job, devoid of all emotion, charisma, fun and frankly anything interesting, although his defeated villain ""Nooooo"" was a valiant effort.The biggest flaw with this film is the basis around Tris. She is told that she is the only pure divergent and so is basically the greatest of them all, but she sides with Jeff Daniels against her Boyfriend Four and is then shown how her choice was wrong.... So she can't be the pure divergent because all she does in the film is make the wrong choice. Why isn't Four the Pure Divergent? He is clearly far superior to Tris in every way. Having said all this there is the possibility that they only told Tris she was the Pure because of how she is as Gullible as a fish, but this wasn't revealed to be and so remains only a theory.The logic in these films are as stupid and illogical as an actual teenagers sense of logic. The one moment that stands out to me is when Four attempts to break out of prison only to be knocked out. As Four is knocked unconscious he is seen to have his cell door key in his hand... Later he is put in his cell, locked up, WITH THE DOOR KEY IN HAND. These have to be the laziest guards in film history for them to not even notice the key which is in his hand plain as day. There are many more moments like this in the film such as why do they still allow Miles Teller to tag along but Its Ansel Elgort who is the one to keep an eye on???Overall This is another YA money maker which brings nothing new to the table other than another acclaimed older actor who needs money. These films are what they are and if you go in thinking that then you can't go wrong, but unfortunately this film is not as good as the previous film due to the lack of Jai Courtney death scenes.",Allegiant
64,barbagvido,"If there wasn't for the last third, it would be awful",5,14 March 2016,"With the first one being great and the second one being decent, I expected this to be somewhere on the same level as the second one. Now they don't have a good source material at all so I can understand if they didn't know what to do with this movie. It follows the book surprisingly well, I mean it's not really faithful but it followed the book more than I expected. This is actually Allegiant - Part 1 with Allegiant - Part 2 being named Ascendant and this one left being just Allegiant. But all they have got left for Ascendant is the ending of the book, so I guess Ascendant will mostly be an original story. But I just think they shouldn't have followed the story of Allegiant as much as they did because the plot of Allegiant is like watching Mr. Bean trying to be super smart. It's surprisingly faithful to the book in the first two acts and that's why the movie seems bad during that time. But don't give up watching because the third act is actually pretty good. The effects are mediocre but there are some cool designs. The acting is also mediocre, except for Jeff Daniels, he's excellent. Woodley is decent, but she, like many actors from the previous movies, looks tired of this franchise. Theo James is probably the only one who was in previous movies that actually seems to enjoy playing the role because he was better than ever in this one. But still, there is nothing extraordinary or remarkable in this movie.Watch this only if you're a fan of the series because it's really nothing special.

66,Dannyboi94,Hugely disappointing,4,20 August 2016,"Allegiant, is the third instalment of the Divergent Series, the first two in which i enjoyed quite well. Divergent was a great entertaining movie with some good action and a good plot, as was Insurgent. This movie however was bland, uncreative and poorly executed. With a two hour run-time, this movie suffers from bland characters and some of the worst CGI and green-screen effects I have ever seen in a movie. The effects are that bad, that the special effects from Firefly look outstanding. The only interesting character is Evelyn, played very well by the talented Naomi Watts, and she outshines everyone around her, making her very out of place when compared to the other poor actors.While this film could have been great, it does have an interesting plot, but it is adapted so poorly from its book counterpart, that you wonder why they even bothered. I can't review that much of this movie, because nothing at all happens, it is that terrible. I am only giving it a rating higher than a 4 because it has a talented cast, who are being forced to work with a director who does a dreadful job.4.3/10",Allegiant
67,blackwidowis7cool,"Flawed, but underrated",10,25 January 2020,"After the message the people of Chicago receive from the Outside at the end of Insurgent, Tris and Four gather together a group of people to travel beyond the Wall to find out what's really going on and to see if the people Out There can help set them free. After a daring escape, they find a group of people who assure them that they want to help them with their rebellion. But there's something suss going on not only in their new-found allies but back in Chicago and Four isn't sure that their new buddies are all that trustworthy, causing a rift between Tris and him. Are they really trustworthy? What exactly are their new-buddies actual plans for them? And will they be able to set the world free?
Unfortunately, almost none of these questions are answered - because of this movie's fatal flaw: they tried to copy other popular movies and divide the finale into two movies instead of keeping it as one. Now, that may work for stuff like The Hunger Games and Infinity War and Endgame, but it doesn't work here, and another problem being, this trilogy started being released around a similar time to The Hunger Games, which caused it to suffer. Or more specifically, for the last movie to suffer.
Plus, the Divergent trilogy wasn't the most original to begin with. It follows along similar storylines that other dystopian movies follow, which also didn't help. But, it does manage to provide an interesting enough story to stand on it's one - until it decided to try and copy The Hunger Games and divide the finale into two. That was it's biggest mistake. And as a result, we will never find out what was coming next (as you can't just go read the book as the movies are different enough to them that you can't just go read them and go 'oh, I know what's going to happen next'). If Allegiant had simply done the final chapter all in one movie, then it wouldn't have mattered if it had still flopped as at least we'd all know what would happen next.
Another flaw in this is the fact that, while providing some different stuff and enough to keep us interested and to warrant a '10', ""Allegiant"" ultimately follows the same pattern that all the other dystopian trilogies I've watched and read follow (with the notable exception of the Maze Runner book trilogy).
Other than that, it boasts great visuals, interesting concepts and themes, great acting, and some questions that, while the story may or may not be all that much, still needed to be answered.",Allegiant

A+. In 'Insurgent' there was a lot of action for the sake of action. In 'Allegiant' it makes sense for the storyline. I went to a conference for writing where I met the screenwriter for 'divergent', Evan Daugherty, and he told me that for 'Insurgent', they tried to appeal to men more My understanding is the original director, Neil burger, left the franchise because Lionsgate wanted to take the series into a more action packed direction. if this is true, that was a BIG mistake. Admittedly, as a girl, i fell in love with 'divergent' for the love story of Tris and four. In 'Insurgent', they barely act like a couple except for one scene. In 'Allegiant' they do a much better job of balancing the relationship vs. what's going on in the world around them. Also to the people comparing this to the book, while i enjoyed 'allegiant', everyone else seemed to hate it so what is everyone's problem with the changes that were made? sure there were some things i was disappointed with, like not delving into the Natalie and Andrew back story like the book does. i hope ascendant does this, but the way they left this movie I don't think that will happen.

70,mikevonbach,A wonderful film... I had more fun watching this then on my wedding night,9,30 April 2016,"While I hate most of the Asylum's movies with a passion, I keep watching because there is something somewhat entertaining about their awfulness and also there's a glimmer of hope that they'd do something halfway tolerable. The Asylum oddly enough have made a few tolerable movies though the best they get is only decent. Jack the Giant Killer is not the worst from them, but it is still really bad. It looks amateurish from a starting point. Watching the costumes, sets and props I didn't and still don't have a clue about what time period the movie was supposed to be set in, and the laughable special effects(especially with some of the worst dinosaur, seemingly poor and personality-less substitutes for giants, effects I've seen for any movie) and editing that looks that someone was having a drug hallucination are no better. The music sounds weird, is not memorable in the slightest and doesn't fit at all. The dialogue is stilted and often sounded like senseless babbling with the actors clearly struggling to get their words out, it also has a lot of cheese and this is when the murky sound is not drowning it out too much. The story, aside from it having a complete lack of originality and borrowing heavily from the likes of Jurassic Park and Aliens, is a structurally thin bore that doesn't make sense or have any charm, fun, wonder, thrills or heart. In my mind, the attempt to mix a Grimms fairytale-like atmosphere with a quasi- modern twist also didn't gel. The characters are annoying and never developed, they're just there for the sake of it. The acting is poor, Jamie Atkins badly under-performs to the point that his performance is lost amidst everything else. Ben Cross and Jane March(who actually gives the movie's best performance) fare better but are severely under-used so while they try hard their characters just don't register and they don't bring much particularly new to them either. To conclude, not The Asylum's worst but has nothing to recommend it apart from perhaps Jane March's beauty. 1/10 Bethany Cox",Allegiant

Oh, no this can't be true.I thought when our heroes went over the Wall and found themselves in almost the same type environment they escaped from that ""here we go into more sequels"" Tris buys into Director David's (Jeff Daniels) explanation as to what they are trying to do: repair all the damaged people and make them pure so they can live in harmony.

72,trevor-82944,"Oh Boy, Another Snoozer!",3,22 June 2016,"I feel insulted by the Divergent movies. Why? I'll tell you. When I was in high school, I desperately wanted to gain more friends and feel like I belong. It was unfortunate that I had to come across these feelings just as Facebook had taken over. This is where Harry Potter comes into play. I saw myself as Harry, rejected, in need of loved ones, and eventually finding a place where he is valued for who he is. So it was convenient timing that the franchise was at its peak in my teen years, the last of the movies premiering the same summer I graduated high school. But does this Divergent book series live up to reflecting those years the right way? I guess so. Does the movie series live up to my expectations? No way.I get it, Tris is a hard worker who is trying to figure out where she belongs. I've been there before along with every other teen. I guess Divergent stands out from other young adult novels by how it criticizes humanity and exposure therapy. Then again, these details ought to actually have some serious attention paid to them while bringing the books onto the screen. The most boring of all of them being Allegiant.As far as the continuation of the series goes, it's essentially Tris leading her friends out of Chicago, over the wall separating them from the outside, and meeting with the Bureau of Genetic Warfare, the outside organization that found ways to control human genetics. They have also found ways to control the people camping outside their city by kidnapping and erasing the memories of the children. This reality is not bad, I just don't care about this world in the same way I did about Hogwarts.This movie wouldn't have sucked if you enjoy listening to painfully obvious messages like, ""is it better to kill a healthy child or a sick old man?"" Or, ""people are sheep. They need a shepherd, lest they be slaughtered."" Or, ""Leaders make tough decisions to protect their people."" Now look, they're all well-meaning philosophical statements, but hasn't The Hunger Games already done all this slightly better?Not to mention there's so much lazy exposition through computers and characters saying their exact feelings in the most obvious way. Seriously, this series is 4% emotion and 96% exposition.That's really one of the only pluses of this teen franchise wannabee. The most excruciating part of this movie series, especially this one, is the acting. Although all the actors still look the part, their performances will stab you in the ears and eyes because of their absolute disinterest. All they do is put on one clueless facial expression, leading actress Shailene Woodley having the worst case of it. Her pale face turns intentionally spectacular moments into absolutely hollow wastes of screen time, she won't even rattle after hearing her life is on the line. Then there is of course more of her mega awkward romance with Theo James, two who you can tell she doesn't really like in real life. She barely even looks him in the eye.The pain doesn't stop there though. The Whiplash star Miles Teller gives the most inexcusably annoying performance in the series. I can't put my finger on as to why, but every time the kid opens his mouth, I just want to strangle his neck and yell in his face, ""SHUT UP!""At least the new villain played by Jeff Daniels acts different from the rest, as he miraculously overplays the part, yet at the same time underplays it.These dreadful performances make me seriously plead, ""why Lionsgate, why? Why get Robert Schwentke to direct?"" He showed no appreciation to what he was doing with the story's message of union within people. He rather follows the directing advice of George Lucas by telling his actors, ""faster and more intense."" Except he took faster as in ""let's get this take done faster"" and more intense as in ""we should more intensely get our scenes filmed today so we can premiere this movie in six months as scheduled!""So, what's going to happen next? Will Lionsgate change the controversial ending of the book? I don't think there's any reason to worry, as reading the books would prove more valuable than seeing these half-baked movies. The books bring some meaningful messages about how our thoughts and feelings create more safety than if we were without them, and how we ought to be unified in our diversities, not segregated by categories. So say no to cliques. We are one as a nation. While Harry Potter did add to my life as a teen by making me feel like I belong in a society of segregation, the Divergent book series also do a satisfactory job at teaching our current youth to ignore the government's declarations on segregation. Yet the movies, Allegiant in particular, insults Veronica Roth's thoughts on America. So I won't be watching this on Blu-ray, and neither will you.Overall Grade: D",Allegiant

74,OlieRendch,"Unlike Insurgent, it had an actual story but was let down by bad CGI and uninteresting plot.",6,17 March 2016,"So Allegiant is the third film of the Divergent series, an adaptation from one of the many teen post-apocalyptic novels. I really enjoyed the first movie, it was very entertaining and it had a good story and characters and the second one I thought was very weak and it didn't really seem to know where it was going until the last act.Allegiant picks up not long after it's predecessor and follows Tris, Four and a few others venture out beyond the wall. I'll start with the things I liked about the movie; the cast for one thing are still great. I think Shailene Woodley and Theo James still do excellently as their characters and despite Miles Teller's off- screen persona I enjoy watching him act. A new addition to the franchise is Jeff Daniels who looked like he came straight from The Martian to play the same character, but he suits that type of person so I enjoyed his role here. Another thing I always enjoy with these movies is the world building; I like the look and design of both sides of the wall and find it visually interesting every time I see it.Some things that didn't work for me in this movie now. The special effects for some reason, I don't remember it in the previous two films but here quite a lot of the CGI was really noticeable; some of the green screen didn't blend in to well and the flying vehicles sometimes looked a bit video-game quality. It didn't detract too much but it certainly took me out of the movie once or twice.Now I have to say the plot was handled better than Insurgent as it had more of a story and actually did things but overall it just didn't seem as big. Amongst the choppiness, Insurgent had tense simulations and a huge reveal at the end but Allegiant seemed just....Okay. It was comfortable, it was mellow, it didn't seem as impacting or meaningful. Also there were some major points that they kind of just brushed over; scenes and reveals I thought were integral to this world were shown or mentioned but nobody seemed to be that bothered and just accepted it.In the end although Allegiant was better that Insurgent in the sense of pacing and I enjoyed the landscapes and technology they showed, it didn't quite have the level of interest for me and the climax felt like something you'd see in a TV series.",Allegiant
75,fluturoj,Plunging,6,21 August 2016,"Way worse than the first two parts. 'Open the door MOM', 'I won't remember you' - WOW way to go on emotional manipulation. I was very pleased with the first two parts and expected more from the last one but was let down terribly. The real-life lessons: always think on your own before you believe that they tell you. Tris did not take Fours word for it, that there was something wrong and I liked that-she made up her own mind. She also chose not to believe anything David was telling and went back to her home as soon as she learned he lied to her. He could not be trusted. So yeah, making up your own mind as soon as you see whats happening is an important thing. Plausibility: well maybe its just me but I don't really think that the movie makes much sense. If David control everything why did he not just release the gas from the central, why did he need someone from the inside to do it? I mean if he can close a door from his outside why can't he realise a gas. Also, if people are divided in factions were so committed to those fractions before (since its who they are as they are genetically modified that way) how come it is so easy for them to forget anything and how they are and follow into a war so easily. Why are the people not keeping the factions? Isn't that who they are? Character development: I liked the dilemmas that chapters faced in this one better than in the first two parts. It added more to their development. Tris-as I said I liked that she did give in and immediately listed to what her boyfriend had to say, I liked that she wanted to be convinced for herself and did what she believed was right. I liked that she used her own mind and made her own decisions. Strong character right there. Four-I liked that he questioned what was going on and that he did not believe everything in an instance. At first I thought that he was feeling jealous maybe (well maybe that is not the right word), something like put down that he was for once the under class. He was used to always be the first, the best and suddenly he was not good enough, he was in the lower level. I suspected that maybe that's why he wanted something to be wrong with the centre, he couldn't bear not being the best. And that's why he decided to go back home where he is indeed the best. Where he is in leadership or at least along it. Maybe the scrip writes wanted him to come across as a selfless, smart men that saw something was wrong and wanted to help his home, but if you look deep enough (and if this was a real life character) than its more about him not bearing the fact that he is not the best and wanting to go to a place where he is. Storytelling: it started on the right foot and it was actually quite exciting in the beginning but than the story started to get down. It became more boring and more obvious. There a lot of unanswered questions left like what is happening in between Chicago and the centre? Why did people resits going to a clean place? Why would they prefer to be outside in the dirt? Why would they not volunteer their kids to a healthier place?Didn't David say that Tris was the only one that was pure? Does that mean that David and those other in the city are damaged as well? Didn't he say she was the only hope, didn't he say that the experiment was to clean the human genome? Then why is the city not helping the centre and not extending the funding? What else are they doing besides the experiment? As I said its maybe just me but there were a lot of questions I had left after the movie finished. Maybe they will be answered in the last part.",Allegiant
76,sildarmillion,*Diverges* from the flawed source material; does not improve upon it,6,21 March 2016,"I have decided that I do not like what the director, Robert Schwentke, has done with the franchise. He directed the second film, Insurgent, and the third, Allegiant. I can understand why anyone would want to deviate from the source material because there were many problems with Veronica Roth's writing. The books had a flimsy premise but excellent commentary. To reconcile the two, Schwentke got rid of pretty much all the commentary and turned the franchise into a B-grade sci-fi action flick, the kind with over-the-top ""futuristic technology"" and over- the-top post- apocalyptic landscapes. The major changes in the plot make it very campy, when the books weren't all that campy to begin with. If this franchise was trying to live up to the Hunger Games films, it did not go in the right direction.There are some positives - the cast did a fantastic job. Shailene Woodley's Tris in this film is a major improvement from Insurgent, in which ""she cut her hair and grew an attitude"" (as my brother described it). Theo James as Four (and to some extent, Ansel Elgort as Caleb) was given a bugger role and did a pretty good job. Miles Teller had been the best thing in Insurgent and he continued to be hilarious. He's very different than his character in the book, but I'm not complaining, because he is incredibly entertaining. Zoe Kravitz as Christina was okay. I'm glad that she got enough screen time to have a major role in this film. I also think the movie deserves serious props for having a very diverse cast, both in terms of race and gender.It is interesting that we are going to get a fourth film - Ascendant. The third film, while it didn't follow the book, does very roughly end where the third book ended. Minus the incredibly controversial ending. Which makes me think that Ascendant will likely be an original story and might diverge from that ending, but we shall see. I'm glad that we're getting a different director for the final installment.",Allegiant
77,captainmike-michael,Much Better than the Monotonous Insurgent,7,14 March 2016,"Coming to the third installment, the trilogy is mimicking the tones of the Twilight series except the fact that the Divergent has a much better story telling. The film rebounds from Insurgent's monotonous narrative, kicks in a lot of action sequences and further expands into a broader external universe. In this 120-minutes of adventure, it just has too much to tell compared to the first two episodes - the civil war within the city and the tactical games outside the world; the fast- pacing plot reduces a lot of usual unnecessary romantics but it does not sufficiently compensate to explain properly the politics, causing it to be slightly confusing of all the hidden intentions. The visual effects improve by a margin while the scores composed by Joseph Trapanese are strong and entertaining. The bio-science theory might be underwhelming due to diversion from its original novel, however it's still overall a solid final part one young teen adaptation compared to the successful Hunger Games series.",Allegiant

79,Badmoviessuck,I'm Allergic to this movie,2,12 December 2018,"This movie is trash and RT where right, this movie is worse than Insurgent.ORIGINALITY
In my opinion this movie feels like Divergent all over again.
They are in a place they think is good secrets gets leaked and we find out that those people are liars and they are actually bad.
This movie is really predictable and i knew as soon as Tris meet David that he was a scumbag.PACING
The pacing is cancerous and it made the movie so boring.
All it was, was Tris meeting David and them exchanging boring dialogue.
They never actually tried to develop the characters with the time they had.CHARACTERS
Tris is probably a Mary sue and if not pretty close to being one.
They say that Tris is pure and all the others are damaged and in my opinion it feels like they are changing the premise and the lore of Divergent instead of expanding it but it's just my opinion.
But i don't like how Tris is so perfekt and that she is 100% pure and everyone else is damaged, they make her out to be this really special person and that makes the character a little bit worse in my opinion.
But she is a bland character who dosen't bring anything to the story.
Four is better but still bland.
I would have liked it more if Four was the main character of this movie cause he would be fitting and he actually develops a little bit as a character.
Peter is the best character in this movie cause he turns his back on others to benefit him and that's amazing.
It shows how unstable he is as a character.VILLAIN
The villain is bad and delusional.
His motive is to create peace we need sacrifice things.
I can understand his motive but it dosen't get developed enough to be a good motive and that makes him a pretty bad villain.
and why he is delusional is because he said that he has seen everything Tris has done in Chicago and he still says that the faction system is the only way to create peace.VERDICT

81,RLTerry1,Possible a strong start to the conclusion of the Divergent Games,6,18 March 2016,"Of course, we won't know just how well it finishes until the second part. Surprisingly, The Divergent Series: Allegiant part 1 provides fans with a good start to a well-executed conclusion. After the week sequel, it was quite unexpected that the series would begin to complete this YA series on such a high note. Unlike the disappointing conclusion of The Hunger Games, Allegiant brings back your favorite characters you love and love to hate in a very satisfying ending in the dystopian adventure to rescue a people from themselves. At the end of the day, the Divergent series will never be as successful or generate the same fandom as The Hunger Games; but simply comparing the last two films in both franchises, this is clearly the superior finish (or should be). Although Roth's socio-political themes and subtext were fairly clear, all be it still weak, in the first two films, the message is a little vague and incoherent in Allegiant. Two YA franchises down and one to go. We will just have to see what lies in store for the Maze Runner series. Just like the Divergent series has a week middle, hopefully the weak sequel in The Maze Runner will pave the way for a strong conclusion as well. One thing is for sure, Allegiant contains far more action than the previous films which almost makes the weak and still completely explained plot worth the approximate 2-hour run time.The first part of the final chapter in the Divergent Series takes us beyond the wall into a desolate wasteland. Follow Beatrice/Tris (Shailene Woodley), Four (Theo James), Caleb (Ansel Elgort), Peter (Miles Teller), and Christina (Zoe Kravitz) as they embark on a journey to seek help from the outside in order to stop the civil war in dystopian Chicago (or modern day Detroit). With newly asserted leader of the faction less system Evelyn (Naomi Watts) and Amity turned Allegiant leader Johanna (Octavia Spencer) at odds with one another, war is brewing in the streets and all hell is about to break loose. Barely escaping Evelyn's security team, Tris and her band are rescued by a team from an organization of pure bloods who oversees the ""Chicago Experiment."" This group of researchers and scientists led by David (Jeff Daniels) recruits Tris and her team to develop a plan to save Chicago, or so they think. When Four discovers what is really going on, he must convince Tris and the rest of her band of rebels to make right what is going incredibly wrong.For me, and I am sure other critics, analyzing this particular series, The Hunger Games, and Maze Runner gets boring. Because, for the most part, they all have the same plot, same fallacies, and similar subtext. They are all extremely socio-political methods to spread the message that only teenagers are special and are capable of saving the world from corrupt adults. Although these movies are aimed at Generation Z (anyone born after 1995), they still attract attention from Y/Millennials (~1982-1994) and Generation Xers (~1965-1981). That is important because Generation Z does not have the spending power that generations X and Y do. In order to maximize the income potential of the films, the studios have to appeal to Generation Zers in such a way that it will also bring their Millennial friends and potentially Generation X parents. Since schools are constantly preaching the message that teenagers are the future, they are special, and uncontaminated by the greed of the world, it makes since to create films based on books that carry that theme. The negative side effect to this approach is creating a generation(s) that automatically distrust adults and their respective decisions regarding the environment, politics, and society. Just as Allegiant depicts what happens when there is such great division among a people who view the approach to peace so very differently will devolve into a war-like state, it's entirely possible that reinforcing this division between Generation Z and X/Y could symbolically arrive at the same precipice.The production value and design in Allegiant definitely outshines the prior two installments. That is important due to the fact that Roth's political subtext definitely becomes a little muddled in this last chapter. Although there is definitely way too much cheesy CGI, it is far less than the previous film. And other than some of the outlandish technology used in the story, for the most part, the defense, security, and surveillance technology used by the various characters makes sense and is perfectly believable in their universe. There is even a real reference to 21st century earth's scientists experimenting with the human genome. That helps to create a sense of futuristic realism in the Divergent universe. One of the biggest problems I have with the plot is the still unexplained history of how exactly the Chicago experiment began. Perhaps the director and writers did not feel it was necessary to provide a clear history through character exposition, but I am still a little confused as to how the Pure Bloods and Damaged became so incredibly separate. Another thing, if there are thousands (if not millions) of Pure Bloods in existence, then why use the Chicago Experiment as a method to see if a Pure Blood can be born out of all of it??? I guess that is why it's not worth overly analyzing films such as this one.For what it's worth, Allegiant is an exciting start to the last chapter in the Divergent Series! Far more entertaining than the last one. If you were disappointed by Mockingjay Part 2 than rest assured that you will definitely enjoy the conclusion of this franchise. Not a bad way to spend your Spring Break or an afternoon over the weekend. But, I wouldn't bother seeing this film in IMAX or 3D. However, I can see some benefit to the experience of this film by watching it in a D- Box auditorium.",Allegiant
82,FandomFanatic21,What makes us different ties us together...,7,21 April 2018,"Allegiant, is the third and possibly the final installment in the Divergent Series. In this film Tris uncovers the truth about her life and the society she lives in, where beyond the wall she learns to escape the world she knows into a new one where she discovers her city was an experiment to help contribute towards saving the human race. The film was a bit mediocre as the film gets off track of what the series was made for. It was enjoyable however instead of the directors wanting split the movie into two parts, they should have just put the events all into this film. So the ending is a cliffhanger, and we'll never know what happens in the end unless you read the book. However, the film does remind us to break the boundaries of our world and be different than the social norm.""You want change with no sacrifice. You want peace with no struggle.

I kept feeling like the author was trying to make some type of point about diversity, but the science fiction didn't seem to add up even for science fiction. On the positive side the special effects were fun and Theo James is hot and his character becomes more interesting in this film.The movie would have been better if the backstory/history had been told more, perhaps in flashbacks. The scenarios just didn't play out in a way that totally made sense. Maybe it will all become clear in the final episode; I hope so.The interaction among the characters is quite weak in this installment compared to the previous installments.

84,h-62007-26888,Ok...now I'm mad,3,22 June 2021,"I gotta say, this was the first time I actually felt MORTIFIED after watching another installment of a movie franchise. It's enough that the other two movies are garbage enough as they are, but at this point, I've had enough of one of those love-story cringe tales that happens to be the Divergent series.To set my mind straight let's start by discussing the writing. This one is about our heroes trying to escape Dystopian Chicago following Evelyn's uprising. And once they're out, they have to discover new threats and shocking truths that shift their alliances. Now how many times have you heard of a story like THIS before? Conceptually, things are already going wrong for the story when it's filled with a whole bunch of cliches that end up going as far as the eye can see. And if that's not bad enough, the film also makes things worse by indulging in numerous of other problems for the story, like a weak execution on what they want to do, a preachy message about acknowledging that your loved ones are what matter the most, and the complete lack of originality in the plot. But in general, there's no reason as to why this is a big deal. Many people agree that the writing for these films is just garbage, so there's usually one thing they get right to salvage some of the flaws. Divergent had an initially interesting concept. Insurgent had fast pacing. Allegiant...honestly doesn't have anything to save the story. Maybe it expands the world of Dystopian Chicago, but that isn't enough to make the story modest. Maybe the concept of splitting the final adaptation this is into two parts has potential, but it feels like they stole the idea from the Hunger Games. The third installment of Divergent clarifies something important: the Divergent movies DO NOT know how to tell a story.So, when you have materials like this for a Divergent movie, how would you interpret that visually? Well, since the director doesn't acknowledge how these kind of movies are supposed to look and doesn't care what people think about them, he would treat them as if they were TV films with huge budgets. Now, as much as that sounds like the movie is visually garbage, let me clarify something: this is definitely not a BAD thing. It's not good, but it doesn't mean the movie is visually garbage. In general, the look of Dystopian Chicago is promising to create some great eye candy, delivering on some strong looking visual scope whenever there would be a need to have that. Also, I will admit that the visual effects are at their best whenever the characters are outside of the city, showing the world outside as a desolate wasteland with no safe place to hide. But those are probably the only good things to say about the visual style. As great as the visuals can sort of be, this is one of those times where they have a strong execution from a weak concept. This is mostly evident through the seriously hefty budget that I feel like went more to the actors than the look. And if that's not enough, there are other things in the visuals that can feel a bit unfinished and even a little weak, like meta cinematography, hectic editing, and some pretty weak rendering that doesn't look very polished. That, and there is also the action, which is mostly affected by the poor editing that can also make things much worse. As a result, the movie loses its sense of engagement and at times can feel like it's moving at a snail's pace. But regardless of how bad the action turned out, there will always be one awesome scene where Four fights a group of soldiers to bring down a hovercraft.In each of these films, the characters all were stuck with their own issues that could make these films difficult to sit through. Granted, the actors have always done their best to salvage any flaws they might have, but in this film, I don't think I've ever wanted them all to DIE more than now. Starting out with our leading lady, I'll start with Tris by claiming that I don't know WHAT happened. Somehow, Tris has turned from a generic main character to a DESPICABLE drama queen who's now become one of those characters who screws over everyone she knows just to satisfy her own personal ego, which I never thought could happen to the MAIN character. On top of that, she can make things worse by having these pointless character arcs and just acting like a jerk to find out what's really going on...and for some reason I can't help but now find her to be unusually attractive. I'm sure that'll satisfy the dark side of MTV! Anyways, the only other character here with any relevancy is Four, who's basically just emotional support for Tris to hang onto. In the case of the others, they really don't do much to help the movie. The new ones like David are just background characters for the sake of compensation or exposition, anybody who returned from the sequel is kind of pointless like Evelyn, and the other characters are only there because I guess these actors needed a paycheck. This is mostly evident through Caleb being the Sir Robin-type coward he is, Christina trying to be the generic good friend, and everybody's least favorite Divergent character, evil Miles Teller (or who you would know as Peter). Okay, so it is noticeable these characters got a downgrade. I just didn't expect it to end up going like this.Recommendation? I'm gonna ask you to look at the title. Forget everything else. Just look at the title. The Divergent Series: Allegiant. This should give you a good idea of all the movie is at this point and what it's about. If this is enough to get you even remotely excited, set your expectations high, have a need to see it as soon as possible, and you'll most likely enjoy it. In fact, you probably have an unchangeable opinion of these movies, so why are you even reading this review? But if you're still skeptical about this franchise, let me do you a favor and say that this is not worth your time or money. If you ask me, I never liked the other Divergent films and this one didn't change anything. In fact, I feel like this is the WORST of the three, and that's why it gets three out of ten stars. At this point, for the sake of the trilogy, it should stay a trilogy.",Allegiant

The third novel ends miserably, and creates a storm among fans. I see that the subtitles ""Allegiant - Part 1"" and ""Allegiant - Part 2"" are replaced with ""Allegiant"" and ""Ascendant"". Major subtitle changes may lead to major film adaptation changes. ""The Divergent Series: Allegiant"" proves it.Tris, Four, and their friends go beyond the wall amidst the chaos in their home city Chicago. They arrive in the mysterious Bureau of Genetic Welfare, and there they discover a bigger battle to fight.I really love the action sequences, some good drama, well-done romance, great pacing, and themes. The film talks about diversity, discrimination, human nature, society, science, and genetic engineering. GE is very controversial right now, with its perks and perils. If some youth don't like historical films about prejudice because they think they're boring, tell them to watch this sci-fi action film because it's fast-paced and action-packed. The message is subtly conveyed, not slapped to your face. Watching the film's diversion is quite shocking. However, I highly like it. Splitting a final book in a series into movies meets mixed reaction. But I think it's allowed more time for the novel to unravel.It's fine with me because I enjoyed the movie.The film ends with a cliffhanger, which is very common in movies of film series.

In 2016, that choice that transformed Tris Prior and that nearly got her destroyed has now defined who she was. Allegiant is all about the choice that has defined Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley).

88,pendenquejohn,"Boring, predictable and annoying",2,28 December 2016,"I have to admit, I did not read the book but I agree with the general consensus that this was a movie principally written fro the teens. I've encountered this many times where it is complicated to judge a bad movie and here's that same problematic once again. Quite frankly, I am genuinely surprised by the high rating on IMDb when I really did not get that feeling.The story - One has to admit that the whole thing does not make much sense. I understand the chaos on earth, this is not the first movie to ride on that specific subject but then, where do we go from there? Factually, the writing was all over the place and there were so many directions that it is really difficult to keep pace. Add to that the predictable feeling that you often get in this genre and you have a perfect fail movie.Besides being consistently annoyed, the whole thing is tasteless and flat. The scenes which were supposed to require the spectator to work with his emotions were overall bad due to the incapacity of some of the actors to bring us into something else.Furthermore, we really need to talk about the consistent moral lessons. They were persistent and was certainly the main underlying elements of the story. Quite frankly, that was fundamentally annoying -; especially when given by Shailene Woodley: ""Save the world"", ""We should not fight one another [...] All of this is indeed true, but this is supposed to be an action movie, not a ""Fable de la Fontaine"". I've always kind of found it annoying when action movies do that and at least 99.9% of the movie was about that.The writing - Almost more than half of the story was written around Shailene Woodley and Theo James (for the teenagers I would guess). I'm really not fund of either and especially Theo James. They're probably better at being models than being full time actors.Their relationship is annoying and frankly takes up about more than half of the story. When, the guy could not accept that his girlfriend sees ""David"" only just for a couple of minutes, that's how overdone this pseudo-love story was.Finally, on this part, the relationship between Theo James and his so called mother was really kind of brushed aside. I don't really have the feeling that there was a will to explore that side of the story. In that respect, it was hard to get a feeling about who this guy really was.The actors - The majority are bad and not on point. Shailene Woodley is boring and emotionless. She's unable to display any kind of anger, something for instance which should be inherent to these kind of movies. She has the same boring personality all throughout, as much as Theo James who seems to be more on a photo shoot than in a movie.Now, if you take these two alone, they're already extremely boring. Projected together, they become the epitome of boredom. Had they counterbalanced Shailene Woodley's personality with somebody a little bit more fiery, then maybe, just maybe, we'd have been unto something, but I have a feeling that we all know the specific reason for this cast.Even when they started quarrelling at dinner time, they were a bore. No ability to suggest anger or deception, just the same boring modeling face over and over again.I have a feeling that there probably was not even a cast. The combination of the five (Shailene Woodley, Theo James, Ashley Judd... and the rest who left Chicago) just did not seem to work all that well.",Allegiant
89,baberchik,ridiculous nonsense,3,29 March 2016,"OK so the first movie (""Divergent""), despite what the people who read the books say, was basically another soap opera - slash - action movie directed at what I am guessing teen audience. Just like Mockingjay, just like Maze Runner. But despite the absolute soap overload in some parts at least the plots were somewhat original though they all had that tell-tale post-apocalyptic-dystopic- 1984ish plot commonality, but all of them kinda ""did okay"" at least in each own way and at least managed to have SOME major and original plot differences that made them over all okay and entertaining to watch.But this movie... oh boy. Flying ""cars"", even more conspiracy nonsense, small flying discs that create placenta (or was it ""plasma""? lol) bubbles around people, small spheres that create a forcefield/illusion/barrier/something, more evil manipulative characters that make no sense, new evil characters, new absurdities of human behavior.... and genetic manipulation? Genetic projects? Memory wiping gas-serum-something? Or how about this: poisonous wasteland covered in radioactive puddles and 100% scorched earth and not a single vegetable left alive... but guess what, people live there, in tents and stuff. Probably doing pow-wows to entertain each other or some other nonsense.I am at a loss. The plot of the movie Vs the actors and the way it was filmed is like... like... eating a pancake, a pretty good one, but there's just one pancake and the rest is a bucket of cream, chocolate, syrup, candy canes, cake sprinkles and whatever else dumped on it. OK another analogy: imagine if a hyperactive 6 year old had to write the plot of all Star Wars movies. Sure there would be action by the boatloads, but the plot would make absolutely no sense. A total overdose of hyped up nonsense, and this is exactly what this movie is. Literally 30 mins into the movie the plot just went supersonic and went in one eye and out the other. Absolute garbage that made no sense at all. Plus the plot now has like 100 different cliffhangers to hang on to, so they'll be milking this movie until the next coming of Christ or until the audiences are just numbed by the continuous river of nonsense that this movie is.Oh and last thing - IMDb mods, better wake up and do your job.

90,ThatAnimeSnob,don't even bother,2,27 April 2016,"So I watched the 3 divergent movies that are out so far and my opinion of them is predictably bad. The premise alone makes no sense since it assumes people live in harmony when they are only allowed to do one thing and any divergence is considered anarchy, punished by death. Plus, the whole thing is excused with genetics and not personal choice. You are born to think in a specific way, if you are not, you are an abomination that needs to be exterminated. Predictably, the heroine is one such individual, not because she chose to think outside the box but because she was born special. Boring! Most of the first movie is about watching her training, which is pretty dull but at least gives an excuse to make her move around and see what the other factions are doing. Up to its third quarter it's a basic dystopia slice of life. The last quarter is when whatever logic this movie tried to have goes to hell. It comes down to evil faction A wanting to kill good faction B so it can rule supreme. For that purpose it brainwashes police faction C and sends it to kill faction B. If they have brain washing technology why don't they simply brainwash faction A and be done with it? As expected, the heroine finds enough time to break free, magically undo the brainwashing of her boyfriend with the power of love, and brainwashes the villain into stopping the execution. It only gets worse in the second movie where nothing makes sense anymore. The villains are chasing the heroine and are unable to capture her even when she on foot and they use cars. They can't even hit her with machine guns when she is simply running out in the open. In the meantime the villain finds this magic box that contains a message from the founders of this stupid faction system. The thing is, it can only be opened by a pure divergent. So she orders the heroine to be captured alive and brought to her so she will open it. Well then, thank goodness nobody knew how to shoot straight all this time or the heroine would be dead and the box would never be opened.This by the way is another thing that makes no sense. If her plan was to eradicate the divergence and control the city, why does she want to read a message that needs the very thing she is trying to eradicate? It goes against her master plan. Not only that but being a divergent just changed from being an abomination to being very important, a thing that contradicts everything the first movie was about.So the heroine opens the box and finds out that not only the divergence are the special ones, not only everybody else is a genetic mistake, but also she is the best of all divergence. Meaning that all this time she was the messiah instead of a mistake. How convenient.This brings us to the third movie where the heroine finds the bureau of genetic modification, who are the masterminds behind all this bullshit. They tell her she is the most genetically perfect human being, so the target audience can also feel special for watching this nonsense.For some reason, the bureau assumes that maintaining the factions is enough to produce divergence, which are genetically fixed. Something that makes no sense since the best way to have more divergence is to have children born from divergence instead of allowing genetically inferior people to be killing the divergence for centuries.This plan makes no sense and yet the bureau decides that now that the truth is out they must make everybody lose their memories and start from scratch. What kind of logic is this? Oh, and if you think the brainwashing BS was too much, get ready to face palm with the amnesia gas. I am not kidding you, there is amnesia gas which will make everybody forget everything and go back to killing the very divergence that are supposed to be genetically superior. Anyways, as expected Jesus-Chan saves the day for the third time, because of course she does, she is Jesus with boobs, and organizes the population against the bureau. Something that will happen in the next movie, which I don't care about because it's all one big pile of BS for brainless teenagers.",Allegiant
91,ericaharris1908,Another ridiculous movie,1,26 January 2017,"I am trying to keep from falling asleep from this boring, stupid, stupid, did I say stupid movie. Asinine, ridiculous, this movie could be renamed, ""How to bore your audience to death"" or ""Movie for braindead corpses"". I feel stupid for watching this so called 'movie'. And I am watching it for free and I still want my money back. Terrorist groups don't need any old torture devices, they can use this movie. Bad acting, check. Stupid plot line, check. Very big, gigantic plot holes that make absolutely no sense, check. You don't care if everyone in the movie does a horrible, painful death, check. Through out the movie you will roll your eyes, sigh heavenly, saying things like ""Why are they doing that?"" and ""That makes no sense."", check. **Spoilers, you knew the one chick was going to die when they got on top of the wall. No bullets hit Tris or Four although they were being shot at at close range and with machine guns, and they didn't get shot as they climbed up the wall. Despite the land outside the wall being completely jacked up from nuclear war, the land is completely toxic, yet people are able to survive on the fridges in tents!!!Where were they getting food and water!!! These people are supposedly exposed to all kinds of toxic fumes, toxic land but they all look normal!!!? Oh, but the Genetic Manipulation place was able to survive the nuclear fall out and create a grass growing (again ON WHAT IF THE WHOLE WORLD IIS A NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST!!!) And the motivations for the characters, stupid, stupid, stupid. David, who you KNEW and the new section were evil. Absolutely nothing shocking. You knew who was going to die, you knew who was evil. And why did Four go back to Chicago? And how did he survive walking through the nuclear wasteland with no issues!!

92,kevin_newdirections,A struggle to pledge my allegiance,6,29 March 2016,"With the faction system destroyed after the revelation that Chicago is just an experiment controlled by the outside world, trials are held for the Erudite and Dauntless conspirators. A power struggle ensues between Johanna (Octavia Spencer) leading the Allegiants, who aim to restore the faction system, against Evelyn (Naomi Watts) and the Factionless – who oppose such notion. Our protagonist, Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) however, refuses to take any of the leadership roles and chooses to meet the ruler outside the city walls. Together with Four (Theo James), Christina (Zoë Kravitz), Caleb (Ansel Elgort), Peter (Miles Teller) and Tori (Maggie Q), they literally dash beyond the walls of Chicago to venture into uncharted territory. They are taken to the Bureau of Genetic Welfare headed by Director David (Jeff Daniels) who dogmatically proclaims that the Bureau aims to fix the human genome damage caused by years of genetic tampering. With Tris, being the only ""pure"" from her city, David believes that he can use her genes to save the ones who are ""damaged.""Given a cliché screenplay, it is still actually possible for a good director to pull things off, make the movie marginally enjoyable. However, Robert Schwentke prioritizes style over substance and we are served a lot of predictable and cheesy scenes. The characters who you think will be good end up good, the bad still remain bad. For scenes where you think help is coming, rescue comes. When a strange thought passes that a character might die, that person does get shot five seconds later. You can practically keep a scorecard to track every predictable outcome you've guessed right.Apart from this, Allegiant in itself is genetically damaged by its plot holes and far-fetched story lines (Yes, it's sci-fi but you get what I'm saying). The film does not justify the consequential gravity of being ""genetically damaged"" (too smart, too compassionate, hence the factions). There's nothing wrong with it because that's just plain reality. This makes you question, David's propaganda to cure these people and ultimately the rationale of the film. Divergent is interesting in a socio-political level, but when Allegiant attempts to bridge the science behind the film's premise, the whole franchise suddenly looked silly.Acting-wise, lead actors Shailene Woodley and Theo James do not disappoint but not even their on-screen chemistry can redeem this flawed material. Miles Teller, who's born to play jerk roles, is fun to watch. He basically mocks everyone in the film with his one- liners and it translates on-screen that maybe, he would rather do Fantastic Four all over again than being stuck in this film. Jeff Daniels is a welcome addition to the series. He lays out expositions and makes things sound polished even though content-wise things are just a bunch of absurd stuff strung together. It's quite a waste actually that we have this pool of talented young actors who might be better off doing other films that showcase more of their acting skills; but every year, they are under contract to reprise these in this bland franchise.At this point, the entire franchise seems more like an experiment in visualizing over-the-top technological advances, boasting special effects, and showcasing awe-inspiring sceneries. Stripping down all of the post-apocalyptic glamour, the premise itself is weak and goes against science and psychology – the film includes a five-minute backstory of the entire series' premise; however it fails to entirely convince. During the film's second half, an orange memory- erasing serum is released and it was around this point that I also wished it can wipe away my memories of the series, or maybe the YA genre in general, so I can fool myself that this is a fresh new take on dystopian films.Read full review here: http://goo.gl/hy5meF",Allegiant

But after I saw this movie,I realized that it was nothing like what it was based on and it looked liked it was based on a video game.I became really disappointed on how the divergent series became a series I don't recognize anymore.If Divergent just became a TV show instead of a movie before the first movie came out, then it would have had a better chance at being more popular and talked a lot about.

94,westen1223,Not a good film but not a bad film,6,23 March 2016,"After the ""earth-shattering"" revelations in Insurgent, Tris and her boyfriend decide to go beyond the wall to discover and find a new world which had been separated from them for 200 years.I can see why the negative reviews because of its confusing plot and unsatisfying performances. But I thought this film had some improvements over Insurgent, particularly due to Shailene's performance. The visual effects were not an improvement over Insurgent and I found its predecessor's visual effects more satisfying. A lot of people claim ever since The Hunger Games has finished (which I find it heart-breaking considering I am a big fan), the YA crowd has died. I think Allegiant can improve a lot more but other than that, it's not a film you would want to watch over and over again just to please you but a film that has some subtexts and a plot to explain properly even though it's sometimes confusing and odd, same with its performance. Miles' one wasn't hilarious, he always betrays his companions and then he allies with them again? A bit of an unusual character to side with your haters. Jeff's performance was brilliant, he was able to portray his character fully and properly. He hid his antagonistic behavior until the end which I found it awesome and pleasing. Zoe's performance was appalling, she seemed as if she didn't even care throughout the whole film, she isn't the actor who you'd want to hire in a YA series. Ansel's performance was okay. Wasn't the anticipated person who would be the extraordinary but he wasn't as bad as Zoe's. Everyone else who I did not mention except for Tris, their performance throughout the film was lovely and astonishing.The Divergent Series: Allegiant.

95,dareent-amethyst,Better than expected,8,18 March 2016,"I came in the theatre thinking this movie might be shitty since thats how movies with two parts usually turn out. They usually contain a lot of unnecessary dialogues just because the director has to spare enough scenes for the second part and end with an annoying cliff hanger. Fortunately, The Divergent Series: Allegiant - Part 1 isn't one of those part 1 movies. It was really fun to watch and they keep you at the edge of your seats for a good amount of times. There was some really predictable scenes like the one where the tattoo artist got shot, and you just know something is a little off about David although you can't really tell what it was. However, the movie turned out great, at least for me and my date. I couldn't get my eyes off the screen. I enjoyed the climax because i really didn't know what was going to happen and I kept wishing the movie was not going to end at an adrenalin pumping scene like the movie 'Salt' did. I really hate if a movie ends where it just began to get really exciting just because the producers want people to go see the second part. I liked the ending a lot and I can't wait for The Divergent Series: Allegiant - Part 2. The actors were good, not incredible, but good. I liked the effects, although they also weren't incredible. I liked the plot the most of all, but I still have questions. Hope it would get answered in the second part and that part 2 will turn out as good or even better.

There is no real story and the characters are blindly running around the place and you start to wonder of anything actually will happen in this movie. One would think that the third movie would progress the story significantly, especially after the good first two movies, but in the end, everyone was more or less in the same place were they were.The acting was reasonable and the gadgets were an original concept for sci-fi movies. The visuals, at time, where too obviously fake, but at times were pretty good as well. It's a shame they put so little effort in the story.The character development gave a bit of a surprise with Peter that again makes the same error as always as I expected him to change his way, but other than that the movie is predictable and boring, even on newly introduced characters.

For some the two hundred-year old experiment was hijacked by opportunists. Look, the USA is 200 years old and has returned to an oligarchic, class-conscious system that we were trying to escape in 1776. All experiments gradually move to one extreme or another.Let's see. Hunger Games divides the people by economic production going to the center. Free Trade is one product buying other products. A flow and an interaction. Instead the center provides Bread and Circuses (Panem et circenses) to lull the masses with competition between the Districts. Division and domination.Divergent. The people in Chicago are divided by dominant characteristics will no unification into a whole person (think Inside Out, one emotion helps the other).The lulling comes outside the city. No violence. Good clothes and food but strange living accommodations. The reason for the Chicago groupings comes out slowly. People don't remember how it started, but the elite knows and uses it to feather their nests outside of Chicago.The last entry in this series should ramp up. I liked the acting and the story.

I know it has been reviews saying it is boring and it should not of been split into two but it is faithful to the books. The film is a bit more relaxed than the first two but still continues the trend of a villain and they have to solve it but in this film they also have to set the scene for the final film and I believe that the film struggles as it is split before the big climax of the book.Also the lack of four in the movie as he spends some time missing effects the move as alone is not as strong a character. However, Peter continues with his wit and his funny comments which breaks up the film .

Answer: 120 minutes of utter tedium. We follow our protagonists- doe-eyed Tris and perpetually dull Four- through the wastelands and into the hands of sinisterly-titled Bureau of Genetic Welfare, led by Jeff Daniels' character David.What follows is multiple occasions of Tris being called up to David's office for meetings- like an episode of The Apprentice- but instead of getting fired she exchanges some of the dullest exposition dialogue heard in the cinema so far this year. The set of David's office is so over-designed and green-screened to the point that it just became a distraction.There are large swathes of the film's running time where nothing seems to happen, no surprise considering this is the first of two parts of what is one book. The decision to split the final novel into two is for reasons which can really only be described as monetary, a gamble which appears not to have paid off judging by the box office takings.

106,LiveYoLifeLikeYouMeanIt,Inexplicably bad,3,19 June 2016,"The first two installments in this series were if nothing else enjoyable. The first one, in fact, was well acted and directed, with a satisfying plot and held its own. The second which did have a wayward plot and a messy script was still salvaged by the acting and the cgi-fuelled set pieces which were cool to look at. But this movie fails in every possible aspect.Firstly, let's consider the acting, Shailene Woodley who was the most stellar aspect of the previous movies, is extremely dull and lacklustre. She seemed completely disinterested throughout the movie. The script didn't require her to do anything more than recite a handful of lines but she did engage the screen only periodically. Her character who is shown to be strong and defiant previously, turns into this mute easily-manipulated by stander who does very little in this installment. Theo James as Four, however, I felt performed decently well with what he was given, even if he still grumbles most of his lines. Jeff Daniels and Naomi Watts arguably manage to fit the bill of their generic and plain characters.The CGI, which has been a plus point of this series so far, is squandered in this one, with the surrounding green scene being glaringly visible in several scenes. From a visual concept and set piece point of view, something that Insurgent did manage to execute well, this one once again falls short. With the acting already poor, we do not even have some eye candy visuals to enjoy.Now, the plot. Convoluted and poorly unraveled. Nothing seems to make sense. Character motivations are inconsistent with previous installments and seem to change with the requirement of the script. Whatever exposition is provided is achingly plain and vague spurring endless questions about a variety of plot points, so much so that they threaten to put whatever sense the preceding movies made in much jeopardy.SPOILERS AHEAD- Here are some questions and oddities with the regard to both certain nagging minutia and also larger plot points which completely spoil the overall experience of the movie. The wall climbing scene early on in the movie, which while having been the best actions sequence, was still annoying. Tris is running from the wall to the generator which is powering the fence/wall, three vehicles full of men are shooting at her but their aim as required, is pathetic. Four, who unlike Tris, isn't even running, is also untouched. Soon after, atop the wall, the group decides to begin celebrating their victory prematurely with only Tori returning fire and staying rooted in the gravity of the moment, and as inevitable she gets shot and dies. Why? Why would these characters behave SO very oblivious to the danger at hand. Having been 'rescued' by the Bureau of Genetic Welfare, they're shown the poorly rendered video clip explaining 200 hundred years worth of history. So, genetic mutation in humans was introduced and people were divided on this and then they fought and destroyed most of the world? Some select pure individuals formed the Bureau and the rest died/or were placed in the Chicago experiment to gauge if they were 'curable'? For 200 years? They ran a massive experiment to find if a pure human was possible from among the 'damaged' individuals? From what I see, the life that the damaged lived inside the wall was a much more civilized and peaceful society until Tris wreaked havoc in the first movie, while outside the wall, people seem to be living in a wasteland. So I'm supposed to understand that the 'pure' people set up a massive civilized city for the 'damaged' while themselves living in a barren landscape fighting people at the fringe??? Even the Providence was a tiny area of fairly futuristic looking infrastructure. It is later revealed that David wants funding for his project. Funding? Funding for? For reinstating the factions by wiping the minds of the people of the city? But he did just that without having received funding from the providence, didn't he?? So was it funding for renovation of his own floating castle home at the Bureau? And back in Chicago, Joana sees that Evelyn is killing people that worked for Jeanine, so she, the Wise one, decides it is time to divide whatever people are left, in half and have them fight each other to the death?? And then that gas. That gas which is supposed to be inhaled but is so heavy that it harmlessly settles down at feet level, giving ample time for the warring people to run up a flight of stairs. Evelyn gets shot by Peter in the back/leg, but clearly doesn't seem to have any injury when shown from the back. Tris shooting the ventilation system through the wall absolutely the weakest resolution to the conflict. And magically, the gas recedes quickly and all those people who had previously been fighting each other to the death, come out of the buildings all smiles and happy, some even smiling and pointing at God knows what. So absurd.Overall a very disappointing and frustrating mess that reeks of ignorance on the part of the filmmakers who seem to have concluded that they can string up any random events in a dystopian setting amidst a bunch of teenagers aided by mediocre visual effects and some set pieces. Hopefully, with the change of director, the final movie will be better.",Allegiant

108,geoced,The Divergent Series : More of the Same (but worse),3,10 March 2016,"In the Young Adult Sci-fi genre, The Divergent Series has always been the weakest of them all, but this movie manages to reach a new low ! It seems every episode recycles the same plot, not only from this franchise but also from the more refined Hunger Games series and even from the subpar Maze Runner series. So much so that I found myself mixing all three franchises ! To be honest, all of them are interchangeable. The recipe to a successful YA series is so simple that all you need to do is to slightly change the subplots, the settings and the name of the characters and voila : you get a generic YA trilogy! And if you really want to milk the cow dry, you should make a two-part finale, because, hey, if the public has already seen three of your damned movies, they'll pay for a fourth one, right ? Anyway, I digress, back to this installment then ! To say that the plot is clear as day is an understatement : it is transparent, almost non-existent. Anyone who has seen at least one YA film could have summed up the plot in 3 sentences before seeing this movie.Usually, YA movies have top-notch visual effects, cool futuristic props and spectacular dystopian sets. Well, it seems that their budget got allocated somewhere else because the CGI is second-rate at best. Good sci-fi props and sets have to look and feel like they're real, have a history, a purpose. I would call that ""practicality and physicality"". Allegiant's sets are cool and beautiful but they fail completely in this regard. Especially those ships ! What about the dialogs and actor's performance then ? They are a few respected and promising actors in here, but sadly their talent is wasted. No real emotions, campy lines and superhero-like fighting sequences : that's what you'll get! This movie is shallow as a puddle, unimpressive and uninspired. Save yourself the price of admission and rewatch a half-decent YA franchise like Hunger Games for example. 3 out of 10.",Allegiant
109,tempestnyx,Dull and Overreaching,6,11 May 2016,"Stylistically it's a good movie, the shots, the imagery and the tech within the film make it just a tad better than the previous; and while the tension is there, baked by an amazing cast, this movie a just too long and a little on the boring side to keep the audience entertained for a two hour film.That isn't true, and there is action, but the movie slows down a lot, letting some of the built up tension slip away to have the dialogue and inconsequential scenes bore the viewer. Again, on a directional front, it is a wonderful film, they way the visual effects artistsThat isn't to say that it's a bad movie, it's not, it certainly does give the audience something to think about when it comes to segregation, because at the end of the day, this is a story about destroying those barriers that tore families apart and kept people from uniting. It was a destructive soci9ety that reflects real life history. So in that respect it was well written. But it's long. That is the biggest problem with the film, the way it tediously stretches out the story, adding in big name stars to expand the franchise. That is not always a good decision. Just look at The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn, the best example of a film that was stretched out into TWO two and a half hour movies when it could have just been one film altogether. I'll leave most of my reservations until I see Ascension, but as of right now, it is not looking good.Then there is the dynamic between Shailene Woodley and Theo James. Both of them fit the parts they were given, but their chemistry sometimes lacks. It's easier to believe that these two are friends, not lovers. Which is great, yay, they have chemistry, but not the kind of chemistry needed for this film. Could it have been worked around better? Probably, but I'll give casting credit for casting two people who fit the characters. Woodley also does this thing when she acts where it's not quite overacting but her face scrunches up as if she's about to go into a panic attack. It's not appealing on both a skill lever or an aesthetic one. Their romance was more believable when they were apart than together, which is a shame.And Naomi Watts, honestly she is the biggest flaw in this movie and that's not her fault. It felt as though the writers here didn't know how to translate her motivation from the book to the film. Despite a great performance, her character felt all over the place. One moment her motivation is one thing and the next moment it's another. Honestly the writers were not clear at all about what Evelyn wanted to gain from everything. Peace? Equality? Power? It was a mess.I will say this though, Miles Teller was great, easily one of the best parts of the film. The character in the first novel wasn't appealing at all, just a coward, and Teller does bring that to the screen, three movies later, but what he does that is very incredible is the fact that he makes this self- centered and self-serving character so appealing. He's on the side that benefits him most. And the portrayal just makes the audience smile because while we may want to hate him, he's just so damn charismatic that watching him on the screen is such a delight.At the end though, the movie did make me more eager to read the novel, if only to get a clearer sense of where this film franchise is heading than anything else. Not the best sign for the film but a great sign for the novel.",Allegiant
110,qadreya,Better than the last,7,13 March 2016,"This is much better than the last one, which mind you, doesn't say much. It has a promising start, with two sides fighting for power/control and our heroes stuck in the middle trying to figure out which side to choose, A or B. Eventually they choose C: leaving. Here is where it starts to get bad. The CGI is quite terrible, B level really. And the colours feels like a scene out of a fantasy video game. The scenes in the 'waste' were so terrible, and the scenes in the 'helicopter' were even worse. You can catch a glimpse of what I mean in the trailer. But the plot, even though predictable, is still good. Not better than Divergent, but much better than Insurgent.This movie doesn't offer many answers, none actually to questions like ""whose really out there"", ""who is left"", ""how did they survive"", ""why isn't the world united"", ""who controls who"", ""whats up with Tris mom"", ""whats the deal with Tris"", ""how are some places protected without anyones knowledge"", ""how did this happen"", ""why did this happen"", ""why is Fours mom doing what she's doing"" .. I suppose they will answer all that in the grand finale. The action sequences, even though a few, are also good. I honestly wish there was more, because all action was just Four doing hand to hand combat. Wish there were more of the other two girls fighting. I was just mostly disappointed in Shailine Woodly's character and performance when they left Chicago but she picks up towards the end. Her performance was just dead, she barley had any emotions for most the movie, she just had one expression: flash her big beautiful eyes and her poker face. All in all, an improvement over the last one, but I was losing interest and focus in some scenes here and there. Perhaps the next instalment needs a better director and definitely better CGI and better acting.",Allegiant
111,vibespidersstudios,I was bored from the start of the movie,1,15 September 2016,"For me this movie serious fails when the plot is not original. It is almost like they put in different things and call it a movie with on of the worst CGI moments since I watch Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance. This movie is trying to squeeze whatever is left in the franchise and make some money off of it. ***When this movie is combine with bad writing, CGI effects, and characters you don't care whatsoever...This movie fails on its own from the start. (Which I mostly did because I kept skipping parts of the movie that is good and they still kept talking in a room with CGI like ""Star Wars Episode 1"" but at least in Star Wars you can just forgive that because the writing is a bit better than in this film.) If you want to watch this movie, just don't...It is a waste of time and money to contribute to this film and will make it more money and more wasteful book adaptation to movies are going to be worst than this pile of garbage.",Allegiant
112,FigNewton,If you are a fan of the books...,7,20 March 2016,"I won't bore you with another detailed review of ""Allegiant"" It's been well covered already but I will say that if you are a fan of the books... No need to freak out! Was ""Allegiant"" the movie perfect? No. Not by a long shot. It obliterated and basically stripped many of the complex and more interesting layers that brought the characters body and soul in the book. We were left with a very skeletal, fractured and less interesting story. The movie did veer from the original work quite a bit but the substance of the story was still there...it wasn't lost. We still get the point of what the purpose of the experiment cities were designed for. We get the struggle for power and the fight for humanity to fight for its survival against what seems like insurmountable odds. We get the theme of loyalty and family, ambition and greed vs sacrifice and selflessness. All the elements are there.Was I annoyed that this movie is part 1 of 2? Not really. I look forward to seeing how the writers and director will adjust the story. Many fans were unhappy with the ending of the book anyway and would like to see it fixed. We'll have to wait and see if the powers that be stick to Veronica Roth's vision or create an alternate. But really, there is no need to feel disappointed or distraught. It is after all an adaptation! Theo James as Four was awesome, though I felt his character wasn't given much substance in this flick, still he was fun to watch. Bill Skarsgard who played Matthew was a nice surprise. I loved every scene he was in and Miles Teller stole the show as the always self-serving jerk, Peter. We didn't get much from Zoe Kravitz and Maggie Q was great as Tori. Shailene Woodley was OK. She could only work with what she was given. But the fellas carried this movie from beginning to end. Even Jeff Daniels had his moments.Overall, I thought it was entertaining. Not perfect but I give it a pass.",Allegiant
113,artieup,Not what I was Expecting,6,20 March 2016,"I had to go watch this movie series just to justify the mixed ratings I read.Well, I have to say, In My Opinion, there was more going on in this movie that was unrealistic and slow than favorable / enjoyable moments.So, personally, I won't hold fire against the comments that rated this movie below a 7. I actually would say they are right on target.I have to say movie quality has certainly went down over the last 6 yrs. I'm beginning to believe many directors and movie industries are expecting movie goers will watch anything with engaging previews to suck us in and torture us with the rest of the movie being BAD.I am a sci-fi fantasy type movie lover, loving the tech and all that stuff, however, there is a threshold as to what I enjoy watching when it comes to this type of movie genre and this movie just don't quite get there for me. Divergent followers or not, this movie fails for the length of time and plot it delivers to be enjoyable.As stated before, I don't believe in rating movies terribly low, so I give this movie series a generous 6 without going into more details.Thanks",Allegiant
114,MovieCraz,Highly disappointing. Weakest of the franchise.,5,20 August 2016,"I watched this movie last weekend with my family. We had high hopes for this movie in the beginning, but now......This has to be the weakest movie of the franchise. Let me first tell you the things I liked. Tris grew her hair out- thank heavens. Four (Theo James) was in it (YAY!). The scenery was cool. Well, that was a short list.Onto what I disliked. 1: The lame, never ending talk with David. *sighs* Tris must have talked to him for a solid hour of the movie and NOTHING came from it. I cant even expand on this because there is nothing TO expand on.2: The script. Weak. Just plain weak. And boring. Cliché. There was one point in the movie where Peter cracks a sarcastic joke that I just knew one of them was going to say something retarded. Ding ding ding! Christina had the honor of delivering that line. After a really LONGGGGGGGG PAUSEEEEEE.3: The orange floating bubbles. WHAT THE CRAP? 4: Tris. Did she start to look like Jeanine by the end of the movie? She was a spoiled, selfish brat in this movie. She treated Four like dirt when she wasn't making out with him in the corner. I was so disgusted with her and was hoping for her to die in THIS movie.5: The throwing away of good characters. Was Christina even a part of this movie?6: I hate Caleb. What a boob.7: Can Peter pick a side? Ever?Honestly if Four wasn't in it and Peter didn't crack his (couple) of sarcastic jokes this movie would deserve a 0. From the very beginning this looked like a low budget, junior director high school film.Watch just to go through the series.",Allegiant

I know that there is a part two of this movie coming out in 2017 and I just hope it's a lot better then part one.,Allegiant

The acting was great,there are at least seven characters that are well-known. The only cons that really bothered me in the film were the scenes that were too similar to other young adults movies which you can probably guess.Finally,if you don't come with too much expectations you will receive a 2 hours of an action packed film,which you probably forget at the end of the series.-Ido Yam-",Allegiant

The movie they did together called The Spectacular Now was nothing short of...Spectacular. But, the Divergent Series started so strong, then took a big tumble with Insurgent, and barely recovered here.By the third act of the film..I began to at least hope for a thrilling ending. While I won't spoil anything i'll simply say, I was far less than thrilled. The acting was fine, and the addition of Jeff Daniels was fun but, having never read the books, I found the film to be choppy and uneven. Had so much been cut from the book, to make room for the final film, that it was obvious on screen? Was the narrative just not there? I don't know..all I can do is hope that the final film takes a cue from the final Harry Potter, or the final Hobbit, and uses what works..to conclude an uneven series that has so much talent at its very fingertips!",Allegiant

There is way, way more sci-fi then necessary, and BAD sci-fi that is! It's really poorly done, bad CGI and stuff. And where the story from the books was at times confusing, this was downright dumb and mad no sense. The biggest book-moments were cut out, probably to make room for the bad CGI... I kind of expected it to be bad, 'cause the 2nd one wasn't that good either. It also seems the actors get less and less convincing with each movie. Contrary to the Hunger Games (that also differed from the books somewhat, but functional imho), these don't live up to the books at all. If you read them, don't watch the movies.

123,twinpeaker,The weakest of the three films in the series,4,22 April 2017,"Watching this sequel I found myself often speaking to the screen stating - ""knew that was coming"". If this is the reaction I have to a movie, then it is pretty bad and this one is. But, let's get one thing out of the way first. Say what you will about Shailene Woodley but casting her as the lead in this series was wrong. She does not have the fire that a Tris should have. There are moments of determination that she displays in the appropriate scenes but that was about it. So this has been a distraction for me throughout. As far as knowing what would happen ahead of time, there are multiple scenes where this is the case. I like to be surprised by the depth of thought that a writer had in constructing a scene to show that my simple mind was not imaginative enough to determine an ending to a scene which was unexpected. This is OK because that is what I pay for to see a movie. But in this one, I was rarely surprised with dramatic outcomes of critical scenes. This leaves me wondering who watched this before releasing it to the public, children ? I mean some adult executive had to screen this movie and had said - great, let's go with it. If you're wondering about the 4 star rating, I am a sucker for special effects and there were a few in this movie that were pretty good and enjoyable. Otherwise, pass on this one and hope another sequel is not in the works.",Allegiant

There is no development, yet scenery changes, but in a disappointing way. There are moments, when they are again in high risk situations, yet manage to have some passionate kissing scenes, when all people they know may be brainwashed. That kills the story. Tris is way to easy to manipulate considering what she has been through and experience base she has, right hand of main governor is always a bloodthirsty idiot - not sure why considering that Four's mother is kind of willing to achieve peace. David is kind of clever man, his problem is underestimation of so called damaged and Tris. And then again - why so, if they have monitored them since ever. They know, what they are capable of.

I loved the first two movies. I thought they were great. But not so much Allegiant.I think this film has too many similarities to The Maze Runner. For one, the setting the characters live in is revealed to be an experiment. 2, the setting is surrounded by a massive desert. And 3, the characters now have to escape from an advanced corporation whose intentions are supposedly the best.What got me mad was that this movie, I kid you not, did not follow the book. AT ALL. Say the film DID follow the book, all of the issues of generic plot points and elements would have been totally eliminated.But, the movie did have a good mix of action. I liked it. It was fun.

I have not read the books but I feel like people really give these movies a hard time because of the Hunger Games comparison. All the cast give an amazing performance and the movie left me wanting more. My only complaint with the movie was the ending when Evelyn gets shot 3 times and then gets up 5 minutes later and walks around like nothing had happened. Further more everybody who saw her get shot did not seem to think it was strange when she got up and walked around.

133,phoebelim96,Disappointing,4,23 March 2016,"I really wanted to love this movie, but it was downright disappointing. If you haven't read the books, I'm sure you will enjoy this movie more. The director basically changed the whole storyline. I expected changes, but not this much. They took away many scenes from the book and added many others that were not. Im glad he will not be directing the final movie ""Ascendant"". ""Allegiant"" has good action sequences, most of which did not happen in the book. For example, the scene where they left the city and were being chased by Edgar, the scene where Tobias was in the aircraft and assumed he was heading back to the city, the scene where Tobias was being trained by Nita etc. One big action sequence they could have left in the movie, was the one where Nita tried breaking in to get something and Uriah got severely injured. There were lots of humor throughout thanks to what they added to Peter's character. (Peter was not meant to be the 'funny guy' in the book) They could have left in scenes like Zeke and Tobias breaking Caleb out of prison. Tobias and Zeke had some interesting dialogue in that scene. (in the book) Also the exchange between Tobias and Peter. I feel that in the movie, his (Tobias) character was really boring. Characters like Matthew and Nita were extremely different from the books. In the movie, Matthew is this secretary type character and Nita became a ""soldier"". Peter also turned good in the book, not helping David as shown in the movie. The director also changed the verdict for Marcus, Marcus was supposed to be banished, not get his memories erased. The whole GD and GP situation was also not as secretive as they portrayed it in the movie. The movie also exaggerated lots of things. They pushed 'futuristic' too far and some things were a little weird, like the protective bubble thing and the liquid that Tris was suffocated by in the shower. In the book, the bureau was not that futuristic and they didn't use aircraft that often. Wish they kept the water and stone sculpture too. I found it interesting that when Tris was wearing the white dress with heels, she reminded me of Jeanine. Overall, I would rate this movie 6/10. For goodness sakes, if you are making a movie based on a book, FOLLOW THE BOOK!",Allegiant

Four is by her side. The city is in barely contained order. The peace is fragile and the trials of Jeanine's accomplices only serve to break the tentative coalition of Factionless, Kandor and Amity leadership rather than solidify a new order.The city needs help and Tris is sure the answer lies just beyond the walls Evelyne (Four's mother and leader of the Factionless) has put on lockdown. Of course she, Four, Christina, Peter and Caleb escape and find out the truth. Or part of it. Intrigue and mystery pursues.The story was good but I have questions, gaps I want filled. The acting was fantastic as usual, the tension between characters palpable. It was however predictable. Only one plot point surprised me and in fact is the part I have the most questions regarding. We saw very little of Christina in this film.

136,pha100,Another Downward Scale In The Divergent Series,6,24 April 2016,"Allegiant is the 3rd movie out of the Divergent Series and the 1st part of the epic conclusion to the saga. This film does deliver action and suspense but, it has a hard time delivering the epic climax and the full scale between Chicago and the Bureau of Genetic Welfare. The CGI and effects in this movie are completely absurd and too distracting (in my opinion). I felt that it was overused too much throughout the movie and hopefully in the next and final film, editing producers will take that into consideration. The director, Robert Schwentke, didn't deliver a well performance in this film as he did in ""Insurgent."" This movie has it's pros, for starters; this movie has a great cast, Shailene Woodley and Theo James prove themselves as true heroes in this film. In addition, Allegiant illustrates action sequences that gives the audience suspense.In the next and final Divergent movie, Ascendant, the director, producers and editing team really need to focus on how they can create a movie that sticks to the books rather than doing a new interpretation of it. So far, these movies haven't really connected to books and possibly the reason why their doing very poorly in reviews and box offices. If they want the last movie of a worldwide phenomenon saga to be amazing then, my suggestion is to make sure that they STICK TO THE BOOK!!! It's unfortunate that Lionsgate is reducing the budget cost for the last film yet, it's the producers fault for doing a very poor job thus far with the previous films and this one as well.Overall, The Divergent Series: Allegiant has it's ups and downs but mostly poor level of work put into this film. The last movie has potential unless they stick to the book and reduce the CGI effects and make the setting more realistic.Rating: 6/10",Allegiant
137,vladimirstankovic94,The Divergent Series just became something with Allegiant,9,8 January 2017,"In my reviews to the first two sequels I harshly criticized the movies, for a reason of course. The first two movies were a disappointment when it comes to action, tension, visual effects and the plot. However, Allegiant is something completely different. I can hardly believe the progress they made since the first two parts of the movie. The plot became much more original and exciting, tension-building devices were awesome, visual effects great and what we have as a result is a a compact whole which works perfectly fine on the screen.What I really liked about this movie is that it is much richer with emotions and sentiment. Mother's love, family, friendship, betrayal, everything is served here and it really touches your heart. Something I definitely didn't feel with the previous two Divergent movies.As you can see my rating for the movie is 9/10, because I still don't like the choice of the female protagonist. Her acting got better this time, but still she is such a baby face for the role. And also some parts of the movie were a bit predictable and clichéd. That's why I cannot give it a 10.But I highly recommend you going through a bit of torturing with the first sequel of the series and a part of the second, because you will be rewarded with the astonishing third part. I hope they will keep up the good work with the last sequel of the movie. And I am definitely getting the books.",Allegiant

But this should not be thought of as a standalone movie, or even part of a movie trilogy, but as one more episode of a really good story.It succeeds on all counts - writing, direction, effects, story. If you like the first two, you'll love this one.Watch it. And don't read too many reviews :-)",Allegiant

You divided us into five different categories known as factions believing that this system would be successful in healing mankind. Your system was inconclusive and therefore failed. We are the future. The people who plan to destroy the system allowing all to interact with one another, eliminating the division amongst society. The city of Chicago is the future and we plan to bring peace and unity.The third installment in Veronica Roth's trilogy of the divergent series directed by Robert Schwentke in 2016 continues to tell the story of Tris Prior's quest in re-developing Chicago. After opening the sacred box holding the message from the future, Tris has become an iconic figure and a member of the leaders of the city. Jeanine is death. With the unknown remaining outside the wall, Four's mother, Evelyn, requests to keep the wall closed for the safety of the people. All members involved in Jeanine's plan to take over are put on trial and killed for their wrongs. Tris is infatuated by the unknown existing beyond the wall and decides to take on the dangerous exploration with friends Christina, Peter, Tori, boyfriend Four and brother Caleb. The group ends up discovering an entirely new advanced world taking them on the most exhilarating journey of their lives making difficult decisions and asking the question, who can you trust?

The truth of the matter is, this movie, and the entirety of the series, has truths and messages hidden within it that most will NOT notice or understand unless enlightened, intelligent and aware of our true reality.This movie is undoubtedly NOT for everyone but for the small percentage of truth seeking individuals, aware of society's bullshit, give the series and this movie a shot.I fell inlove with the characters, even the ones you're meant to hate. Four IS one of the best portrayed characters I've seen in a while and Tris was taken on by an extremely talented actress, not by Meghan Fox who is nothing but a walking piece of plastic tits and ass--- and face, with no personality and no ability to portray emotion beyond that of thumbtack or robot.",Allegiant
146,TunaDm,Full of clichés and nonsenses.,3,29 July 2016,"After Diveregent and Insurgent, now we have got new nonsense movie in Divergent series - Allegiant. It is definitely the worst of Divergent series of movies. Diveregent and Insurgent were at least watchable, although had some clichés. Allegiant, on the other hand, puts clichés and nonsenses on hole new level. Movie is amazingly predictable and full of clichés (David is firstly portrayed as good guy, and than becomes bad guy; Tris decided to trust David, although she knows him for a few days instead of Four, who is love of her life, because he is powerful and know what he needs to do etc.) About the performances, Shailene Woodley, who is very talented and promising young actor, just don't fit in her role. Other actors - Theo James, Jeff Daniels, Miles Teller were solid, but sometimes now convincing enough. Ansel Elgort, who portrayed Caleb, gave us really bad performance.Is this movie worth watching? The answer is: No. Plot full of nonsenses and clichés just doesn't seem interesting, just predictable. There is nothing unique and special in this movie. Avoiding it would be best possible solution.",Allegiant

Tris on the hand not to dependent character compare with insurgent.

I do not expect a movie to follow the book exactly, but the other 2 movies mostly did. The 3rd movie had very little to do with the first two. No point to the changes, it did not make the story more powerful, it actually neutered it. I can't see how Veronica Roth could have been happy with the Allegiant movie. Poor Naomi Watts, her lines were so horrible. Her Evelyn was just whinny. Miles Teller had nothing to do. The world they created in the movie, the airport and the fringe, not at all accurate. Again, the changes were pointless. If you are a fan of the Divergent Trilogy, do not bother with this movie.",Allegiant

As a fan of the first book, I thought the first movie was pretty decent and had potential, but after Insurgent being a very big disappointment, I didn't really expect to like this much. However, the story is pretty gripping and the action is on point. Even though Tris is annoying at times, she is nowhere near as annoying as in Insurgent. I loved the character development of Caleb and Four, the relationships between the characters, as well as the new characters introduced in this movie. Overall, it's a pretty good installment to the franchise if you loved the first movie.",Allegiant

If I enjoy a movie, Ill make sure it does get good feedback and this relatively goes for Allegiant. Allegiant was a pretty good movie. The negativity is over-exaggerated, seriously over-exaggerated. I realize that a majority of people are hauling up all this negativity because they are getting butt hurt that the film sort of strays from the book. Yes, I have read the book but seriously they barely change the plot. I only remember bits of the book since I read it a really long time ago like a year ago and there is nothing to get even remotely butt hurt over.In summary, if you are scared this is going to be a waste of money and time, I implore you to go and see it for yourself. I went to the cinema with a low expectation of this film and by the end was questioning, what the hell these people are complaining over. Solid safe 7 out of 10. No generosity. It deserves a damn 7.

It's about finding ones identity, about the pressures put on young people to make them fit into cookie cutter stereotypes that people want them to be to conform to ""normal"" society and not cause trouble by having a mind of their own and for thinking outside the box. It's about being at that age where every choice you make determines the rest of your life and feeling the pressure and weight of fear you get when you have to make those decisions.

157,j-j-j-rizkallah,The story will keep getting better and better !!,9,10 March 2016,"I watched the 2 previous parts of the divergent series and liked insurgent better than divergent. And now Allegiant is also a great addition to the previous movies it has the same rhythm as insurgent:the story's buildup takes the first 30 to 40 minutes of the movie and then you can sit tight and enjoy a good show!! The movie has good action scenes and suspense will overtake you in the last 30 minutes!! I enjoy movies where the plot is good enough to keep me focused for a whole hour waiting to see what's going to happen and enjoying every bit of it. So if you have the same taste I recommend allegiant strongly to you. And I assure you if you liked insurgent before you will not be disappointed by allegiant, it is up to the expectations. I frankly find that the divergent series has continued the right way unlike the hunger games!!",Allegiant
158,jeph_b,Significant Improvement on the last Movie,6,28 March 2016,"I'm not a big fan of this franchise, but the first movie was reasonably solid and entertaining. The second was hugely disappointing and actually fairly boring.As for Allegiant, I think they've somewhat rescued the franchise with this film. It answered a lot of questions and moved the story on. We find out the truth about what a Divergent actually is and the truth about what is the other side of the wall. There is some good action in the movie and it's still feels very much a twilight, hunger games style teen movie. The acting is fairly average for what you would expect.The overriding feeling I got though is how on earth have they got 4 movies out of this franchise? We haven't come a long way in the story so far yet we've sat through 6 hours of movie time. I don't therefore have high hopes for the 4th and (hopefully) final installment. Large sections of all 3 movies could have been cut out and merged and we could have seen 2 really good 2 hours movies. Instead it will go down as another disappointing franchise spread needlessly over 4 movies. Money...",Allegiant
159,starwarshansolo,"Out of all three movies, this one is the worst",5,14 March 2016,"Okay, this movie is just okay. The filming was different; nice landscape filming but a bit rocky at the start for close ups. The film starts out pretty abruptly as opposed to Divergent and Insurgent who gradually got into the movie. The plot is pretty boring and if you haven't read the books a bit hard to follow. The affection scenes were a bit lazily done and gave me no emotional feeling. When it came to the climax scene, it wasn't really ""climatic"" to be honest. It seemed like the scene was not important and was quickly done. Thruout the movie, there are many scenes where there is no continuity or mention or explanation for why that happened and felt like there was always something new and didn't finish that new thing that happened. The ending was not very special and thought there would be more. I understand that there is a new movie coming out next year but it felt like a 30 min movie when it was actually 2 hours. It felt like the characters were getting nowhere and just always seemed too relaxed, like when someone died the characters didn't seem to sad and moved on, or when they accomplished something they were very nonchalant about it. There were also some comedic scenes but they were very misplaced and at the end where the action is supposed to happen. It was very hard for me to find these scenes funny as I was expecting something a bit more exciting(more fighting, climax etc.). The movie had very good special effects and everything seemed very real. Overall I think the movie was okay but it could have done better.",Allegiant
160,katieca-14685,"Modernistic, pseudo-science galore",1,13 August 2021,"Apparently, the final book of the Divergent trilogy was to be filmed in two parts and this was Part 1. I found this out after watching it, and apparently all hopes of Part 2 ever entering production are now lost. So this review will look at the movie from a stand-alone context. I have also not read the second and third books, so I just took the movie at face-value with no further information.This third instalment finally explains how and why mankind and society turned out the way they did, answering questions that should have been asked and explained by the people of Chicago 200 years ago. There doesn't seem to be anything stopping them from doing so. And turns out, the whole faction system is a human experiment, and the people beyond the wall (what's left of them, anyway) have all-along been watching the city of Chicago in a disturbing Truman Show-esque way.I am weary of using the word 'predictable' for each of these movies, but that's exactly what it is. If you are aware of the usual way these movies tend to go, you will find this film very tedious to get through. Add in the ridiculous stunts that these teenagers are capable of, and this movie is just hard to swallow.At one point Tris and her friends are abseiling up a vertical wall on thin black ropes (Caleb too!, without any Dauntless training, although he did struggle a bit). And if that were not enough, when Tris doubles back down with Four following right behind, they then scale the wall again but this time with Tris in Four's arms. All this while armed soldiers are shooting at them (and they always miss, even though our leads are in point-blank range in the wilderness with nowhere to hide).Our main characters are always infinitely more skilled than the veteran soldiers, no matter the situation. The funniest scene for me was when Tris and Christina show up to save Four, and they're running down the corridor with guns that should be too big and heavy for them to handle, with facial expressions that say anything but 'firece warrior', and take out a group of armed guards. Even with their fancy, flying, multi-purpose discs (which Tris just learnt to use with no training), it's too much.Speaking of these fancy modern gizmos that the people beyond the wall use... How is it that their science is so advanced that they can spy on the city of Chicago Professor X-style, but they cannot stop a bunch of green teenagers from foiling their plans? I mean, why was it so easy for Tris to steal the Governors aircraft, and why didn't they have provisions to remotely control it in such a situation instead of trying to force autopilot to land it? And why wasn't the isolation valve that was needed to pump the mind-wiping gas better fortified? All David could do was close a few doors, while leaving others open so Tris could still get close enough to destroy it? *shakes head* And speaking of the mind-wiping gas, why, oh why, was it hugging the floor, giving everyone the chance to escape unscathed? Also, if it were colorless instead of such a bright orange, nobody would even know to run away from it. What a terribly executed plan for such a modernized society!Let's talk about Four. He's the only one who seems to act normally in each situation. Tris trusts David so easily, even after everything she's been through. Four is able to see that something is not right, and maintains a healthy dose of skepticism without being unfair. His action scenes remain fun to watch, and are the best of this series. One out-of-character moment for him was when he suddenly decided to call Evelyn 'Mum' at the end. That whole conversation was so contrived, and the relationship between the two of them had been so lacking throughout the series, that it genuinely felt like he was only trying to manipulate her into opening the door so Tris could save the world.The most promising part of the movie concerned the rounding up of children by Bureau soldiers and wiping their memories to rewrite them as citizens of the Bureau. We finally saw a glimpse of the vulnerability and distress of the common people in the father who was shot down in front of his son while trying to protect him from Bureau soldiers; that was, hands-down, the best scene. They took some time with it, but that's why it was so effective. I feel this arc raised important ethical questions and addressing these could have improved the quality of the film, but it wasn't revisited/resolved and as chances of a sequel are next to none, it seems it never will be.And that brings us to the main problem with this series: it touches on important issues without any real insight or lessons learnt. The horrors of living within a faction-based system are not adequately shown. I mean, we see Tris very unhappy in the first movie, but she's no different from many teenagers who are still trying to find themselves and she seemed happy enough in Dauntless. Some exposition of life among the Factionless might have helped, but they seemed to be pretty well off if I'm honest. Then later, when Jeanine imposed martial law we didn't see any serious consequences of this. Of course, we watched Dauntless soldiers forcibly test everyone for the Divergent traits, but we didn't properly see the distress of the people. Instead, we followed Tris and Four around, this indestructible power couple who could save the day no matter how unfavorable the circumstances were. We are left, not thinking of the bigger issues, but instead cheering these two on as they kick ass. It's all about them.Another issue with this film is that it never really explores the motivations of the characters. David never comes across as the passionate, mad scientist who really believes his research will save humanity. Instead, he seems like a spoilt child pushing people around only because he can. The whole concept of 'the end doesn't justify the means' is hence not adequately explored. Evelyn is portrayed as strong, but she is a weak character whose main motives are never well established. She is pushed around too easily and never truly seems to be in control.Finally, the end credits were a big slap in the face as they didn't follow the aesthetic of the previous two films. There was a disconnect and it seemed the genre had suddenly changed from dark, sci-fi, YA to a romcom. The music didn't help at all.I definitely don't recommend this. I did find the ending abrupt but I don't feel the loss of the second part at all. There are much better movies and TV series to watch in the same genre that suck you in and address the big issues with more profundity while still remaining entertaining and believably so.",Allegiant
161,strysickchloe,WTF who approved this :(,1,28 July 2019,"This book made my cry and so did the series because throughout all three books the characters changed and prospered in a way that I could relate to, making the story feel personal. Though the movies did not, and in behalf of all the fans and audience who read the divergent series we would have much rather been deprived of a movie series than been given this piece of garbage.Every thing in this movie screams cheesy which to me can only mean that whoever created this disrespectful monstrosity did not even care or even respect the books enough to glance at the plot or how it is undergone throughout each book let alone care about the story to begin with.If there are any directors out there who would like to remake this movie to pick up the shreds of brilliance this movie ripped from the book than please take the chance, I would even volunteer to take part in it!

Allegiant has definitely strayed away from the book, but I think the concept that Roth put forth in the book is still portrayed in this film- just with a different angle on the storyline. The acting is exceptional in this film, with such a strong cast portraying these characters in such an honest and conventional-breaking way. What I particularly like about this film was that Tris and Four have conflicting views once entering the Bureau, with Four seeing the gritty side of this society, and Tris experiencing the ambitions of the elite. Theo James' performance was absolutely amazing, bringing out the deeper and more sensitive side of Four whilst maintaining a strong figure head in the film. What I would however say needs improving on this film is to see more of Tris- Shailene Woodley is such a strong and influential actor, who I thought needed more screen time as she is the protagonist. However much I loved this film, I believe that the producers don't give the book justice, it seems that they make it for purely money, and not for what the book and the actors can truly portray. It is clear in interviews that the actors may also feel the same, but this film is definitely not just a 'lesser version of the Hunger Games', it's entertaining and has lots to offer",Allegiant

This movie does a lot to make you consider in terms of your world is based on your environment. If you don't look outside your normal day to day life you will have a 
very narrow view of the world you live in. People who seem to be honest and have your best interests at heart are just trying to get something from you or further there own ambitions of power. No, the movie is very left untied at the end it was as if the production company had their sights on making Allegiant a 2 film ending. Unfortunately, the film didn't get great reviews which caused the next film to be cut. Funny, but now was the time to watch the film because the storyline is more about how your point of view is shaped based on your environment. So many of us don't look outside of our News Media that we watch normally and the writers that we read to consider the world may be much different that we may think.

And I think that was only due to the fact that the movie had been so consistently horrendous up to that point, any scripted line approaching tolerable was a shock to the system. Honestly, an embarrassing ordeal not just for the author of a much better book series than these movies seems to paint them as, but for a very talented cast of actors as well. One sidenote: Jeff Daniels' role as the not-so-secretly-self-serving-CEO-with- corrupt-intentions is getting quite old at this point - see Looper, Steve Jobs, The Martian (to an extent), Allegiant, etc.",Allegiant

At first upon seeing the reviews I was a little in shocked at how much criticism it was receiving, but sometimes your opinion can be different from the critics who review the movie. So I saw the movie, and as I watched the movie I started remembering scenes from the book, since I haven't read the book in a while. There was scenes that surprise me, which I thoroughly enjoyed because I love surprises. And although, yes the movie strays away from the source material, we as people should be more open-minded about book to film adaptations. As a fan of the books it can be nerve wrecking to have a good book turned into an awful movie, but I like to think about how much time was put into making a film. An actor/actress works hard to follow the script that is given to them, the director has a vision in mind for the film, which is hard work in itself. And putting the film together takes a lot of shots to achieve in the amount of time they are given. This is why we have deleted scenes to begin with. I praise this cast for not giving up on this project and continue to do their best to pull off a movie adaptation of a best- selling series.All in all, I enjoyed this movie and recommend it to people who love stories and fans who can still appreciate a movie despite its obvious changes.",Allegiant

The first two films in the series were great and I would easily watch them again, but this film, it just had no drive to it until the very end. Good acting at times by some really top actors but most of the time, I honestly had no idea what was going on. The special effects in the film were quite good, bit over the top but it just made the film a bit fake. Really disappointed with this film, was very looking forward to watching it. It felt like the film was trying to be something that it's not meant to be, it felt quite forced and not right. As I said before the first two films were quite good and I was really looking forward to watching this but it turned out to just not be great. Hearing that the next film's budget has been cut doesn't really surprise me either. But in a nutshell, great actors, just not a great story line and film I've afraid which really is a shame.",Allegiant

As a stand alone no I wouldn't like this on its own at least the first half because of redundancy. It really almost lost me at ten minutes in. I don't think 10=15 minutes in was necessary if you knew the series and premise or not. But here's the thing it was Divergen at it's best as a movie as a whole and really modern day Sci-Fi as a whole. It's hard to awe or shock audience in the realm of Sci-Fi with the technology and evolution of Sci-Fi in general. I like the story and I want to see where it is going. I don't think that as fan of Divergent series you will get short=change as Sci-Fi buffs in general as stand alone yeah but if you know the series consider what is.

This is a terrible conclusion to a trilogy that had no significant point whatsoever. The writers of this movie demonstrated their own issues with authority and establishment. It was a modern-day knock off of Lord of the Flies and slightly better looking actors immortalized in what seems like a post apocalyptic photo shoot. The deviation from the first in the series, Divergent, was noticeable and the lack of character development and indulging of actors' images. Allegiant was a disappointment to wear this great trilogy could've gone. With the amount of money that's going into special effects, you would think they would invest more into good, solid script writing. I am sure this will feel too young teenagers who are struggling with their identities.

Okay, we can all agree that the trailers and the BIG changes took us by surprise but I went to my local cinemas yesterday and thought about why not go watch Allegiant? It took a lot of will power for me to consider whether or not I am going to buy a ticket because I love the books so much and I know that Insurgent has been a slight disappointment due to changes also but, that movie was good. Anyway, The movie, Allegiant, translated its book parent to be mainstream like explosions, war, and whatnot. That is only because the book Allegiant is not really focused on the war but more focused on political matters concerning Chicago experiments and the existential crisis of characters who have gone and learned the truth beyond the wall. The movie was great it has kept the plot and the whole purpose of the story. The changes like earth being Mars, excessive airships and armies were there to make the movie appealing to those who like typical science fiction events.SPOILER-Y SECTION OF MY REVIEW: (contains minimum details concerning the part 1.) I liked that they had involved the Chicago factions to what is really outside the wall. It was an amazing exploration because the only people who were protecting Chicago from the books were Tris, Four, Caleb, Cristina, I think Uriah's brother or Uriah, I forgot. Anyway the point is, it WAS NOT THEIR FIGHT, it was the fight of every people and their rights of being alive Genetically Damaged or not! This has affected me greatly because finally when the heartbreaking event happens in the part 2, Ascendant, the heroes who have died will not only be remembered by their friends but, by their people. The movie gives more justice for them.",Allegiant
175,yonoidrab,the weakest movie in the franchise,3,22 March 2016,"Definitely the weakest movie in the franchise so far. It was watchable,but overall it was kind of boring and hard a muddled plot. It felt like a lot of important details were left out and it didn't make a whole lot of sense what was going on.It's far from perfect, especially in the CGI department. it's a fun movie that kept me entertained for it's whole duration. It was helped by my low expectations but overall I think is a big step up from the second movie.Another horrible addition to a horrible franchise. Enough said. This movie was so bad, like not even Miles Teller could save it with his Lively .",Allegiant
176,natalya113,Just as good as Divergent & Insurgent! (WARNING: Spoilers),9,30 March 2016,"Warning: This review contains spoilers(Just to let potential viewers know that I am a big fan of the Divergent trilogy (books and films) so I may appear slightly biased!)When I went to see this film, I considered the fact that I had put down the book version of Allegiant due to the reason that I have little free time this year and it failed to engage my interest enough to continue reading it. It meant that I was secretly a bit concerned that the film would fail to engage my interest. This also meant I did not know what was going to happen in the film; however I knew that Insurgent had moved away from the books slightly so I expected this to be similar. At the end of this film, I can say that I was very impressed with it.It followed on nicely from the previous film, and engaged my interest right from the start. The parts that didn't interest me so much was the parts with David and the Bureau of Genetic Welfare; it was a bit too science-related to really interest me, however it was necessary in order to fully explain the situation.The acting was very good; Shailene and Theo continue to do a good job as the lead characters. Ansel does a very convincing job, and Miles continues to be good as the infuriating, yet somewhat amusing (at times) Peter. Jeff Daniels is also very good at playing a very emotionless character who is rather deceiving.All in all, I don't understand the hate for this film. For the third in the series, it is just as good as the others, with impressive special effects and a good plot line. If you liked the previous films, then this one should be watched too!",Allegiant

I am right, not the other people who gave it 2 or 3 stars,they do not know what they are talking about. Trust me. I am required to write more so here is a rhyme. Allegiant was so bad, I wish I was not so sad, that I watched that whole film, and now I feel like I wish I had more time, to help tell you the crime..s.. these people should be charged with, hating the world, murdering my mind, with their pointless story and waste of time.

The problem with movie adaptations when we read the books first is that we go with a pre-conceived idea about what we are going to see, and when it fails, in my opinion, to deliver it's rather disappointing. To me the problem here was the direction, sloppy. The performances, ""mehhh!!!"", and i'm sorry but after three movies i still don't feel the love between the two leads, and that was, to me , what led to movies to not be as good and loved how they should be. The imagery of this destroyed world is beautiful, but the costumes do not go along with it. The effort is there, but it lacks a lot of passion...",Allegiant
179,eliaskrusemaisha,Review of Alligiant - No Spoilers (Assuming you've seen previous movies),3,19 February 2017,"This movie is out right horrible. Not recommend.The actors were OK but below average. Liked Four, mostly from previous ones but he was average in this one. The movie is way to SCI-FIish, turns me off to be honest. I like more, less-love obsessed movies, Tris is just to much in Love with Four. Usuall stuff, always the newer movie in the series = the worse. Look to Dumb & Dumber 2 or Star Wars (My opinion)Actors: 3 / 10+ Half decent, below Average. Kinda how Justin Bieber would perform if he was given the chance Scenery: 5 / 10+ Cool and Awesome effects, very cool graphical layout with a futuristic look To much futuristic theme, should be more balanced. They focused more on graphics than plot Storyline (Events): 1 / 10This was the worst with the move, since this is without spoilers. I'll just say I did not like the whole turn of movie. How it twisted and such. Do not like the character that Shailene Woodley played.",Allegiant
180,sharknado-60075,Allegiant,6,12 March 2017,"It was a decent movie, but my colleagues and I did manage to find some problems. Firstly, we were unclear on how the regular, non- genetically modified people were able to dispatch the corrupted, genetically modified security guards in hand to hand combat with relative ease. It seems if humanity had developed advanced genomic modification technology, employing security guards who cannot be manhandled by Theo James would be a fairly simple task. Unrelated, it seems like Miles Teller's character, Peter, turns evil in like every movie. His character's lack of meaningful development really is a downer for all the pretentious kiss-ups who watch these movies, who may be led led to believe that they can never change. Also, why do the main characters keep letting him make decisions? It doesn't really make sense. Finally, the film revolves around the so-called ""Chicago Experiment,"" which, if I may be candid, seems like one of the most egregious examples of researchers ignoring the scientific method and all control standards put in place by the organizations that govern international science. I don't understand why a study of that global significance would be organized in a non double-blind procedure without multiple control groups and extensive peer review. In the movie, however, there doesn't even appear to be an independent variable. Also, the entire approval process is four people talking to two other people, one of which is literally the result of said experiment. It just seems like they're asking for bureaucratic overreach. Anyways, we've already sent our concerns to Lionsgate, and we assume they are working tirelessly to fix these problems.",Allegiant

So, I hoped Roth would use the movies to change the ending to be somewhat more palatable. With these differences I'm thinking I may be rewarded. We'll see.As far as the movie itself goes, the most disappointing difference is the depiction of the ""world outside."" The books describe a still viable country that isn't that far ahead technologically from the lab- cities (or even our own), except for their progress in medical and surveillance tech.The movie describes a much more advanced civilization. One that makes you wonder ""why even have laboratory cities?"" The mental picture we get from the books is one of a nation trying to restore its population with the few tools they have left. The movie makes us think they could get along fine without the experiments.I'm also disappointed with the speed that they glossed-over the relationship between David and Natalie. I'm hoping they refer to that more in the second movie.So, like I said, I like that we're departing from the books because I hated the book ending. But now I'm wondering if I should be more careful about what I wish for...",Allegiant

That or someone's brain was boiling in the set.The guy who rescued the main actress's mother many years ago is the same guy rescued the main actress and still look the same.One guy named Four?!!4 rockets can't kill a man.The old bad guy shutdown the wireless communication between one guy and the lead actress and the guy had to run to her to show her how to stop the gas. The girl run to stop the gas but now she can communicate with the guy again (that's a lot of memory).When they sucked out the orange gas, people were laughing (happy?).

193,rdmains-1,Fixed some things but broke others,4,21 June 2016,"OK so I read and loved the books, but there were 2 things I hated about the last book. I hated the ending (as everyone did) and I hated the way Four's character became less of the man we had known and more of a dependent, whiny, jealous jerk. The movie fixes both of those issues for me. But that's about where the good ends for the movie. I realize they can't make it exactly like the book, but to make such a departure from the outside world of the book to the outside world of the movie made it hard for me to watch. They say this movie is part 1 of 2 and that they split the last book, but I don't recall there being much to tell after Tris saves the ""residents"" of Chicago so I'm not sure why there will be a 4th movie other than someone wants to capitalize on this series even further. The story mostly follows the same lines, but there really is nothing left to tell other than maybe how Chicago rebuilds. I have to say though I don't think I will be watching the next movie. This one just was too hard to watch.",Allegiant

I like the conflict between the characters, but glad they didn't make it dramatic. My biggest problem is there are such big ideas in this movie, they needed more time to develop some of them. A few scenes here to flesh out the conflict more. I am pretty sure they didn't do it because they have to follow the currently trend right now, mindless action set pieces with very little story. I appreciate the writers and director trying to accomplish something bigger, but there were still some missing parts. I still enjoyed the movie a lot and appreciate the effort.",Allegiant

Sometimes I'll stay just to see how bad a movie will be, but this was a waste of time. Full of green screen closeups and CGI, I can imagine they only had a couple days of work for the extras. The script was is so lacking in logic or any semblance to reality, for me, it was an exercise if frustration to watch the film. I found the design of most of the CGI mechanicals to be silly and impractical. What they envisioned as ""tech"" of the future is too impractical to even attempt to suspend belief as I do in all sci-fi movies. Did they Botox Shailene so her face couldn't react to anything said to Tris? I finally gave up, wasted half of my drink and popcorn, and left.",Allegiant

197,ddnava96,"Not bad, but could've been better",6,26 March 2016,"First, this movie is so different than the book. If you go watch this movie expecting to see the book's story adapted to a film (or as close as Insurgent was), you'll be disappointed.The movie is a good (not exceptional) re-imagining of the story in the book, and it succeeds to keep it interesting and dynamic.The CGI looks so bad at times. There's a shot at the city train while it's moving slow, and the motion blur applied to it was awful, like if it were going 15 times faster (or if the shot were made using a $40 cellphone).There's also a time when someone's looking at another transport and keeps their sight centered to the moving object, and the motion blur is applied to that static-on-the-screen object, and not the moving-on-the-screen background.Tris' and Tobias' interpretations are good, and coherent to previous movies, but it's a shame the writers (or maybe re-writers? Veronica Roth, books writer, did an excellent job) didn't use all of the potential of Nita and Matthew.They also had some bad decisions. Objects are supposed to act always the same (as an example, ice always floats on the surface of water) but the re-writers decided it would be a good idea to make that object act differently in different places (like 100 meters away).If you like the book series, go watch it. If you LOVED it, probably you'll hate this movie. If you liked the previous movie, you should watch it to get the story complete. If you didn't like the previous movie, this was no much better and you won't miss it.",Allegiant
198,userra,Great movie,10,18 March 2016,"This movie is nothing like the last 2 but to me it's the best. Don't listen to all the haters regarding this movie. If you are stuck on the book versions then don't go. But if you're looking for different view of Tris and Four experience beyond the wall, you will not be disappointed. And Miles hands down to you. Dude you make a character like Peter hard to hate. This movie will have you at the edge of you seat and then laugh at the crazy one liners from Miles character Peter. You will also feel the pain of seeing Four and Tris separated for a short time. The only down side is having Tris character change from the being this fighter in the last two movies to one being out all the action. It just doesn't seem to play real to the character. I think Tris would have questioned it more. Absel character Caleb redeemed himself in this movie. Overall I loved the movie and will no doubt see it again and again. Great job to all the actors!!!",Allegiant

How could it even be allowed to be released when it is far from finished? Also I am questioning if anyone producing the movie have heard the word read thread? Sci-fi can never go wrong if it sticks to a main storyline. the movie was lost already in the beginning. Sad but true. It could have had so much potential. Too much disjointed things going on, bad scripts, undedicated acting and no graphics at all. Sure, certain things do not have to make sense all the time, but this was just wrong.",Allegiant

Once again, Shailene Woddley is bringing the best performance through the whole movie, We get to see more of Tobias in this one instead of just Woodley's character, Tris. The Visual Effects were amazing, The cinematography was incredible and of course, The acting was fantastic, Especially Woodley. It's a lot more action packed than Insurgent and Divergent, there's a lot of running, the wall sequences that we see in the trailer was the best action scene in the movie. Four and Tris chemistry is better in this one. Though the last 30 minutes of this movie is more like ""Ok people, let's wrap it up"". But you will be impressed through the whole movie by Woodley's work. She's definitely a big ++ for this movie. The only issued i have was the pacing and plot.

202,demineal,Unfortunately NOTHING like the books.,5,23 March 2016,"I am a die hard book fan, so when it comes to movies I am always a bit dubious. The directors always change things and drop characters or snippets of the book that I love and wish had appeared, however in general you get over it and enjoy the films.However - Allegiant part 1 - may as well be called an entirely different name. It is so different to the book that you will just sit there with your mouth wide open. Now granted I read the books well over a year ago and was watching it thinking my god my memory had got rusty so i re-read the books and my god. The producers have taken Roths idea and then completely re-written it. Characters are lost, massive chunks are missing, but in most cases the whole book has been re-written. If I was Roth i'd be offended because it is nothing like the books - literally nothing.I gave it 5 out of 10 BECAUSE although i was severely disappointed it was nothing like the books and so overly 'Hollywood' i could have cried (poor Four what have they done to him- he's an action man that just fights and fights - no character development whatsoever) but as a stand alone film forgetting the narrative of the book its OK and watchable. If i had never read the books and had only been watching the movies I would have given it a 5/ 10. The characters are lacking development, the CGI is slightly insane and quite unbelievable at times and the film in its need to be face paced clearly leaves lots of gaping holes in the story. The whole thing just feels under-developed.If you are a die hard book fan - definitely give the film a miss you will just be insulted and annoyed.However if you are easy going and don't mind it being an entirely different story to what you expected - go ahead and try and enjoy it.",Allegiant

Even those wishing to change the book's finale.I have to say the acting work is not that bad. They do what they can with what they have. Tho I'm not a huge fan of Shailene Woodley or Theo James, they are not bad actors. So they managed to go through the movie unscathed.. It's too bad they have changed it that much.

Last year, I saw the 2nd part without knowing the plot. And I just caught up this week by viewing the 1st part and re-watching ""Insurgent"" to have a fresh feeling. And I don't regret it. ""Allegiant"" is more cerebral, there's less action I think. The political and philosophical aspects of the story are better explained here. I liked to see the characters play their part independently, to see them struggle with their own issues. Even if their problems are intertwined with the others. They are a perfect team of saviors. Jeff Daniels as David is excellent. We can see that Tris and Tobias have matured a lot. They still form a great pair. The visual and FX effects were amazing.

I get that most are over the whole YA adaption thing since The Hunger Games, that I liked a lot, ended. However, that is not a good enough reason to not see this film. The acting displayed in this movie was great. Some say that Shailene Woodley's Face had no 'Emotion' and that there was one monotonous tone to her voice the whole time. This is not true. Her acting was on point along with that of Theo James, Jeff Daniels Naiomi Watts and Octavia Spencer's. The New Characters Nita and Matthew were good in their roles.As for special effects and action, they were top Notch in the whole series. The best action scene (Scalling the wall and escaping from Chicago) was very well helmed with good stunt work and even better editing. The special effects were just fantastic and quite colorful and gave a vivid feel to the film. However there is this one scene where this orange fluid is on her face in the shower. It was hilarious. The plot of the film, to me, was quite interesting and flowed seamlessly. The pacing got a little slow in the middle but began to pick up towards it's end.The Film was better than I thought it would be combining Good acting, special effects, awesome action and a solid enough plot together. I recommend this to be seen in theaters.

I also really like how the movie was different from the book, giving us another look at the outside world in the form of a movie. The way that Tris' character wasn't the main focus of the movie really helped make it different from other YA series like The Hunger Games and Twilight. I also loved Peter's character.

I strongly believe that the film, all the Divergent films, are worth seeing. Maybe they are lack of special effects and there isn't a sign of cheap humour but the plot is really exciting. Strongly I believe that the third film is more action-packed than the book. Nevertheless, the story saves its idea to sacrifice yourself to save one's life, to do your best for your homeland and family, to stand for your rights, thoughts and feelings.

214,Nightthinker14,Should have stuck to the book,3,21 March 2016,"As a fan of the book series, I can say that this movie (which was meant to represent the book sharing its name) did not live at all up to any expectations. In summary the plot line was full of major holes, characters that were crucial in the plot's progression were absent and although the visual effects were well done, that is the only part of the film I think that kept me watching. That and waiting for (spoiler) Tris's death which (spoiler) DID NOT HAPPEN.First of all, I could not understand where some of the scenes were being pulled from. This was especially so in the beginning and included the part where an invisible wall concealed this whole army of people and then Tris and co were led away in orange blobs. I can't even begin to describe how over the top and really, really unnecessary that was. Then the deaths... during the team's escape from Chicago, Tori was tragically shot, ""tragic"" as an intention but weakly executed. It appeared like such a random event and I couldn't help but cringe as it happened. The layout reminded me way too much of Maze Runner, I feel like this movie was based more on that than on the actual Allegiant book. The effects were just distracting despite being great and really, I don't know how another movie could possibly follow as a part two as basically everything except Tris's death and the death serum happened.I am no expert and my opinions may be overly harsh as I loved the books, but this is how I found the movie to be.",Allegiant
215,tiny-62696,"I loved it and can't wait to see the final movie, Ascendant!",10,24 March 2016,"I went to watch the movie with my 14 yr. old son and we both enjoyed it very much. My son has read all the books and noticed some changes in it from the book's story but he didn't disapprove of the changes. He and I enjoyed the movie throughout & were left wanting more when the movie was done. The 2 hours this movie lasted went by fast because we were so into it. We are definite that the final installment of The Divergent Series, Ascendant will be spectacular when it comes out next year. I was shocked to later read negative reviews from critics and some moviegoers about the movie. I didn't feel that way at all. It was very good in my opinion. I watched the first two movies and loved them just as much as this one. They all had their own interesting stories and show different story aspects of what can happen in the future in a post apocalyptic city. And Tris & Four have changed so much from the first 2 movies...they are maturing before our eyes. Allegiant wasn't a repetitive story from the first 2 movies. It had its own twist that was satisfying. I guess everybody has their own opinion. To each is own. I myself, really liked the movie & recommend this movie to others. Make sure you watch the first two movies so you understand what's going on in this one.",Allegiant
216,kotesivasaimeher,movie was quite good...,4,26 March 2016,"Didn't reached the expectations....quite different movie , but no Thrilling scenes..1 time watchable movie.... Compared to the 1st installment of divergent series ,this movie doesn't bring any interesting element, the hero of the film (heroine) acts naturally throughout the film.....the film has so many boring scenes ,which seem use less in the movie.... The movie has quite decent screenplay and well designed graphics ,the movie looks quite different compared to 1st and 2nd of the divergent series .....the movie was good at action scenes but bit confusing at the story and I hope this movie will do great business although it is not up to the expectations .... Many characters doesn't gave much importance compared to main cast- hero,heroine and there friends..... So it is a one time watchable movie with no thrilling scenes but had good screenplay .",Allegiant

I personally loved it, it was so amazing ya it wasn't like the book but that doesn't matter I thought it was amazing the way they created the movie ya some scenes from the book were taken out but you never know they may be in Ascendant which is sadly the final movie of the divergent series which comes out in June 2017. I'm also very sorry to all the reviewers who don't have a life and just like to write bad reviews about amazing movies also all of you that say Allegiant is like the Hunger Games well your wrong! because it's nothing like The Hunger Games they both come from two very different perspectives.",Allegiant
218,erwinkaddy,Awesome movie. Cant wait to see it again for second time this week,10,26 March 2016,i think this is my favourite movie among the 3 series that have been made movies. Of course by far much better than any if the hunger games series. Love the actions on the wall... Quite an intro. Love Shailene Woodley. Love Theo James. I was not their fans before this movie. I don't even know them. Though i'm a movie goer. I watch movies almost every day. Its quit surprising to see some negative reviews for this movie. I guess lately many surprising thing happened.. Like the d***pool movie can even make box office. Thats a huge shocker considering that actor swears a lot. Just cant figure out what is too see in that movie. Anyway.. Hope to see more of this franchise.,Allegiant
219,junk-70182,Disappointing and predictable,5,27 March 2016,"This film seemed to rely on the success or lack of the previous two films. The storyline was predictable and somewhat boring, as I found myself looking at my watch after about 15 minutes and thought about leaving. It's too bad a film which has potential has to fall so flat. If I had it to do over I would wait for this film to come to DVD. At least with a DVD you can skip to the end. I was just informed that my review needs a minimum of ten lines of text. It's pretty telling that after seeing this film I can't even come up with ten lines of negative or positive things to say. Would I recommend this film to a friend, no, enemy, maybe. The special effects were interesting, the storyline was lacking. All in all the money and time I expended was wasted.",Allegiant
220,fairy_princess-85263,better then I thought,7,3 April 2016,"Allegiant was such a good movie, it wasn't exactly like the book, but I really like the creative changes they made. first off,Allegiant is a combination of action, adventure, romance, and fantasy. I really liked that they didn't take the romance too far in this film. Secondly, I liked that the movie explains everything that you might have missed or been questioning after the first two movies. Thirdly, The acting was Phenomenal, the cast for this movie did a really good job playing with the audience's emotions. Lastly Allegiant did a really good job making the movie fit the age group of people who loved the book, when you make a movie like this it is really hard to keep it ""kid friendly"" when even the book is a little questionable, and I think they did a really good job making the film fit the PG13 criteria.",Allegiant
221,emonys,movie,1,9 April 2016,"One of the foul movie.full west your time and Money..... I had originally expressed no interest in this series, but was invited to go along with some friends to see Allegiant. In order to have some knowledge of what was going on, I read detailed synopses of the first two movies. A lot takes place and I tried to absorb it. Still, I was the least informed. That said, it took me quite a while to figure out why people were acting the way they were. Who were the villains and who were the good guys. I realize that the leads were the ones we were supposed to root for. They worked so hard to get to this paradise. But wouldn't you know it, Jeff Daniels was there and he wasn't nice at all. The direction this took with a memory erasing gas was beyond the limits of my suspension of disbelief. It's the kind of thing a seventh grader would come up with for a short story assignment. I'm also astonished by the expertise at the time of crisis. A totally unfamiliar machine is mastered by poking at it. This is kind of the that is used on Star Trek the Next Generation. Anyway, the thing is pretty lame",Allegiant
222,sayantaneflu,Bad,4,15 April 2016,"While the previous film in this series set the stage for a hopefully interesting follow up, Allegiant turns out to be a bit of a letdown. Die-hard fans might also find this movie a stretch or rather, a two hour stretch of a film that gets cheesier every ten minutes or so. The resultant product is something that isn't quite unlike a B-movie where everything from the costumes and character styling (incidentally, how did Tris' hair grow out so soon?) to the weapons (which look like they're put together by a 10-year-old) to their dialogue, will make you cringe.Continuing where Insurgent left off, Allegiant sees Tris (Woodley) making a break from Chicago along with Four (James) and friends to try and find out the truth behind their lives as well as the real story about the factions. The truth however, might not be all that Tris had bargained for.REVIEW: While the previous film in this series set the stage for a hopefully interesting follow up, Allegiant turns out to be a bit of a letdown. Die-hard fans might also find this movie a stretch or rather, a two hour stretch of a film that gets cheesier every ten minutes or so.

So, Tris and Theo and their gang jump the wall and head out to the great beyond, only to find that they're not quite as free as birds. The Bureau of Genetic Welfare is headed by David (Jeff Daniels) who along with Theo and Tris, compete for who gets the corniest lines in the movie. Fashioned as a villain of sorts, David has some kind of mambo jumbo theory about their genetic structures and damaged genes. At one point in the movie, Tris wonders aloud about what really is going on. You might find yourself empathizing with her. Clad in a white jumpsuit with hair perfectly in place and Four faithfully panting after, Tris now has a new mission - to rescue the brainwashed and the tainted.Miles Teller gets barely any lines but nonetheless, he does steal the show whenever he is in a scene. But this is a given, as he is by far the most talented of the cast anyways. A plus point though is the set design, a curious mix of ultra-futuristic-meets-retro. But while the underlying concept of the series is the examination of a big social experiment, this gets lost in the film. Extremely lackluster fare, overall.",Allegiant
223,horseanything,Very Poorly Done,4,7 May 2016,"As a teenager myself, even I can see that this film is a poorly done teenage action flick. Shailene Woodley happens to be one of my favorite young actresses, but this role does not do her acting justice. We have seen her do far better work in The Spectacular Now and The Descendants.I have read the book Allegiant and enjoyed it. It is my opinion that the film merely focuses in on the top layer of the book rather than diving into its full significance. The whole book series involved an underlying theme of female strength and independence. This idea was completely diminished within the first several minutes of the film. As Tris and company are attempting to get over the wall, Tris turns to fight off the enemy. When she begins to run back toward the wall, she jumps into Tobias's arms and he proceeds proceeds to run up the wall. This scene was truly laugh-worthy. The ridiculous concept of a man carrying Tris up the wall was only supported by the poorly done special effects around them.The plot is quite shallow and predictable. It is a pretty poorly done action film with poor special effects to back it up. The concept of the gas is an extreme cliché and even that is not executed well. How long does it take gas to rise further than ground level? They just needed to power walk up a set of stairs to be free from harm.Overall, I would only recommend seeing this movie if you really enjoyed the book or if you are interested in wasting away two hours of your life. Several of my friends enjoyed the film, so if you are a teenager who merely wants to drool over Theo James this might be the film for you. Otherwise, I would pass on this one.",Allegiant

225,charliedow,I loved this movie but it had some unexpected changes,9,12 July 2016,"I love the Divergent series, and this was a wonderful movie. I loved the way the story progressed, but I was looking for the things that were in the book like David's confession of love for Natalie Prior, and The eventual death of certain people. not that I wanted to see them die because I like this ending way better where Tris and Four are leaning on each other in the end with David spying in the back ground. But I guess I'm just one to stick to the books. But all together This is a wonderful movie and I would say that everyone should watch it just because of the story line and the way their lives are compared to ours. All together it was by far the best movie in the series and am looking forward to seeing Four, that is if they make a Four?!?!?!?!",Allegiant
226,tytoowls,As a Reader...,1,12 July 2016,"I read all of the books because of how curious I was to see if the movies matched up. What I really enjoy in an adaptation movie is how it brings a story to life; Allegiant takes the story which was quite interesting, and throws the story line in pieces. The suspense and anticipation that I experienced with the previous two films and stories is not the same as with Allegiant. Besides the story line taking a tangent from its original story, the revised story line is bland and predictable. I do not have high expectations for the sequel if they continue to deviate from the original story so drastically. I really hope that I will be proved wrong, but I am thoroughly disappointed.",Allegiant
227,limkris,This is how you ruin a novel...,1,14 August 2016,"I am angry... If they were going to divide the movie, they didn't have to do this... They say they 'covered the story' in this movie, they basically skipped a whole plot... For example, in the book Nita does hate David, but she actually Tries to destroy the Bureau by blowing up a part of it as a distraction (which basically kills Uriah, the guy's not even in the movie to begin with) then trying to release this death serum, Tris stops them of course, and a bunch of other stuff happens... Only then does David try to 'reset' Chicago... And Tris is supposed to die in the process of saving the dam city, then there's this bit at the end involving Evelyn, if they were going to make a series they could've used that... There's just so much stuff wrong with this movie, the most annoying of course are the small but plentiful errors, like never seeing Tori's brother on the other side of the wall, that happens in the book....",Allegiant
228,sadieannjones,Don't know why people are so harsh?,6,6 September 2016,"As a kid the best stories started ""once upon a time"" and ended ""they lived happily ever after"" + I think series like this bridge the gap between kids fairy tales + ""down to earth with a bump"" adult viewing, + appeal to the kid in all of us-no matter what age we are. Don't over think it. Just enjoy the ride! After all it is just make believe, if I wanted to while away the hours I would read the book. Instead I wanted a break from the norm, something different to entertain and that's exactly what this film has done. Okay, it's not complex and possibly predictable for people who have read the book, but as a newbie I have enjoyed watching the growth of the characters and progression of the story. Yes it can be compared to several ""teen"" movies but that's the target audience + if u find yourself watching similar films with a critical point of view its most definitely not going to be for you. But if you want to just be taken away and entertained for a while then this is the movie. No, you don't have to use your brain, but isn't that the point......giving it 6 yes it's predictable, but really enjoyable at same time. All actors are a credit.",Allegiant
229,cncn-26472,Allegiance or Treachery,2,6 October 2016,"We all know movies are never the same as books. Directors cut, exaggerate, and create scenes and aspects that better the visual plot line. Movie adaptations rush the movie and characters lack growth, and are mostly defined by visual effects where the imagery is better than actual plot material. In Veronica Roth's movie adaptation of Allegiant, the main characters are thrown into a new environment with new technological advances, but their dialogue and actions never further their own development, and it ends with no definite plot resolution.Allegiant can be defined as a realistic movie if the world were to truly fall to corruption of humanity's own greed. In the book itself, the characters finish ending a rebellion from the previous book against the higher power, and intend to leave the confines of Chicago to venture out into the destroyed world in search of other humans that could help their home thrive instead of die away. Yet, the movie depicts the basic necessities of the original plot, like leaving Chicago and finding the outsiders that can help them, but lacks important scenes that help paint a greater picture of the characters and foreshadowed events, like Tris and Tobias having multiple little fights that build up the drama of the exposition. Features included into created scenes, like the extraordinary display of technology, never manipulate the characters into adapting and developing into something better.With the characters', Tris and Tobias, world falling apart at the seams from the lack of control over their government, they find themselves facing daunting tasks to survive and correct their home, and this results in the two developing together and separately. Yet, in the movie adaptation it is never revealed how each of them encounter specific obstacles that force them to make drastic decisions that pulls them closer as a couple and makes them stronger as a person. The book explains certain scenes where Tris and Tobias fight, cry, and sleep with one another, but these scenes prove that specific actions and dialogue build up a character's personality and gives them hardships to overcome. In the movie, Allegiant does not display hardly any affection between Tris and Tobias, or any individual obstacles that were confronted by the characters. Part of the reason for the excluded scenes is because the director manipulated the plot on his own accord.Robert Schwentke, the director, provided his audience with a thrilling, action packed, teen movie that sky rocketed its popularity because of its futuristic relations and its exaggerated fighting scenes, but he failed to follow the basic plot of the book itself. Instead, he created scenes, like Four carrying Tris up the wall, and established plot effects, such as the flying drones, to better the audience's visual experience. The display of undiscovered technology was exceptional, but the reason of their creation was never specified and was thrown in to give the audience a better visual of how the future can be pictured. Schwentke also cut out specific scenes and added flourishes to give the movie a fast paced, action movie vibe, so there was no time for any romantic or character developments that were clearly written in the book on purpose for the basis of the plot.Allegiant was chopped up and pieced together poorly compared to the book, but the movie as a whole was an accurate description of the basic plot line, even though it was missing needed details specific to the characters' development. Agreeing with the other professional reviewers, Allegiant deserves a two out of ten star rating, seeing as the movie adaptation was missing key elements essential to the plot line, and it ended with no true resolution, but rather left the next movie to be about the final battle alone and nothing more.",Allegiant
230,leacatteau,Disappointing compared to the two first ones,5,7 November 2016,"I didn't really appreciate the third tome of Divergent, simply because I was expecting too much from it. After watching the two first movies, I was so excited about watching the third one, that in the end, I was really disappointed. Although there were a lot of extraordinary and well-made special effects, there was clearly a lack of content in the story, which sometimes went too far from the governing principle. In my opinion the performance of the actors were great, though. In conclusion, I would say that the reason of my dislike is more due to the plot of the book in the first place, and not to the production of the movie in itself.",Allegiant
231,buttcupp,Box office bust or fan favorite boom?,7,15 March 2017,"As an avid reader, I love to see how directors can take words and create the images in our head. The Divergent series was one of my favorite reads a few years back, so when they decided to put the words on screen, I was more than ecstatic. Opening day for the original Divergent, had me excited of the follow ups, especially Allegiant which was released in 2016. However, after the release of Divergent, many people were disappointed and it created a loss for future production of the remaining movies in the series. Despite others saying they would not be in attendance to watch Allegiance, I stuck through it to prove that the books I loved dearly would be successful on screen. According to the plot line of the original book, the movie lined up very well with how Roth wanted it to pan out. I believe it was a good depiction of how we were supposed to imagine the story panning out. However, I knew the box office sales would not reflect how great I thought the movie was. It was even nominated for 8 awards. Someone had to agree with me then! So despite how tragic the monetary value was from the movie, I believe it deserves more credit and a better rating.",Allegiant

233,kristipappel,Allegiant - Epic,10,26 November 2017,"I am a big fan of the Divergent trilogy. I have read all the books and watched all the movies and in my opinion they are absolutely amazing. Especially I admired the the third movie Allegiant. It is directed by Robert Schwentke and, like its two predecessors, Divergent and Insurgent, its stars Shailene Woodly in the title role as Tris and Theo James as Four. After the earth-shattering revelations of Insurgent, Tris must escape with Four and go beyond the wall enclosing Chicago. For the first time ever, they will leave the only city and family they have ever known. Once outside, old discoveries are quickly rendered meaningless with the revelation of shocking new truths. Tris and Four must quickly decide who they can trust as a ruthless battle ignites beyond the walls of Chicago which threatens all of humanity. In order to survive, Tris will be forced to make impossible choices about courage, allegiance, sacrifice and love. Woodly and James give superb performances. As you'd expect, the film is epic, fast-moving, heart-moving and visually spectacular with jaw- dropping and tear dropping stunt scenes. Definitely it is a thought- provoking movie. However it has its weaknesses. Without reading the book or seeing first two movies, it might have too far-fetching story. Also in some places it is a little bit confusing on whose side somebody like Peter (Miler Teller) or Matthew (Bill Skarsgard) are. Just a little bit confusing, finally of course it all comes out. That said, this is the best Divergent trilogy movie of all time. Far more entertaining and thrilling, its heart-dropping relationship between Tris and Four make the film even more enjoyable. If it is fantasy, awesomeness, action you're after and you are seeking for some mystery and confusions, this film is definitely for you.",Allegiant
