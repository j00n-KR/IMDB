0,SnoopyStyle,compelling father daughter relationship,7,13 October 2018,Single dad Will (Ben Foster) and his teenage daughter Tom (Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie) live off the grid in a public forest in Oregon. He is a former soldier haunted by war. They are found by the police and social services put them into a home on a tree farm. He is uneased by the demands of normal society and he takes her into the woods again.Ben Foster has his quiet intensity. McKenzie is solid as a compelling teen. I would have liked a more intense build up at the tree farm leading to a big climax. It's still a very compelling father daughter relationship. It's a good character study movie. It's reminiscent of other Into the Wild movies although it doesn't have the survival drama. The most dramatic section happens in social services.,Leave No Trace
1,Hitchcoc,It Just Takes You Along for the Ride,9,1 March 2019,"This is a slice of life with two figures making their way. The father and daughter love each other, but he has all the power because of his experience. She is making her way and has never questioned her father's motivations. We never get to know those. Granted, we can guess. Society is not for him. Is he a true survivalist? Is he a bit off his rocker? Is he just born to the earth in a time when someone always owns that earth? The movement from place to place, with charitable looking out for them, makes it much harder. If they were beset by evil motives from others, it would be a lot easier to understand. The girl is wishing for some comfort and begins to doubt where this will all play out. It is a really unique movie, to say the least.",Leave No Trace
2,kosmasp,Family matters (how much though?),9,26 August 2020,"Talk about a slow burner. When the movie started I had no idea why we were where we where or what the movie would ultimately be about. Now that became apparent (family, growing up, unable of letting things go, society and so much more), but where we where or where this would lead to? Much harder to pinpoint or predict.Great acting overall. But as the subject matter is difficult, you can understand that this won't be easy to get a wide audience. Having said that, if you are into that low drama, that character building world that this builds on... you'll have a lot of fun with this. Well fun might be the wrong word, but you'll enjoy watching this - again, I think you know what I mean. And the ending is almost poetic and inevitable ... if you shed a tear or two it is only human. Not that one would call it sad necessarily - the opposite might be true depending on your own worldview",Leave No Trace
3,jboothmillard,Leave No Trace,7,20 May 2019,"Film critic Mark Kermode was saying this was his most favourite film of last year, one of those films where you don't hear characters explaining things as it goes along, I'd heard many good things about it, so I was looking forward to it, written and directed by Debra Granik (Winter's Bone). Basically Will (Ben Foster), an Iraq War veteran suffering from PTSD (posttraumatic stress disorder), lives with his thirteen-year-old daughter Tom (Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie) in a public park in Portland, Oregon. They live in isolation, only entering town occasionally for food and supplies, and Will makes money by selling his painkillers issued by the VHA (Veterans Health Administration) to other veterans. One day, Tom is spotted in the woods by a jogger, and a short time later police surround them, officers arrest them and place them into social services. They are given food and a house on a Christmas tree farm in rural Oregon, on the condition that Will follows the rules of the homeowner and social services. Will begrudgingly starts work packaging trees but is traumatized by the helicopters used to move them. Tom connects with a boy who is building his own tiny house and seems to be relaxing in their new environment. But she reluctantly follows her father who wants to leave, he tells her that they would have been separated if they didn't conform. Will and Tom hitch a ride with a long-haul trucker (Art Hickman) north to the edge of trackless woods. They bushwhack hoping to find an unoccupied cabin, but it is getting dark and cold, they are forced to build a makeshift tent to survive the night. The next day, they find a vacant cabin and move in. Will leaves to find food but does not return before dark. The next morning, Tom searches for Will and discovers him unconscious at the bottom of a hill, she finds some locals who take them to their mobile home community. Will refuses to be taken to a hospital, so local woman Dale (Dale Dickey) calls her friend, a former Army medic (and fellow PTSD sufferer), who treats Will's leg and lends him his dog from the service. Will and Tom stay in the community while Will's injuries heal. Tom likes their new home, but eventually Will insists they leave. But Tom protests, saying ""the same thing that's wrong with you isn't wrong with me."" They leave the community together, but Tom stops in the forest, Will realises his daughter can no longer live the life he wants to. They tearfully hug, and part ways, Tom returns to the community, while Will returns to the woods, it is unclear if they will ever reunite. Also starring Jeff Kober as Mr. Walters, Dana Millican as Jean Bauer and Alyssa McKay as Valerie. Foster gives a good performance as the shattered and haunted ex-soldier, and McKenzie is a talent-to-watch as the young girl who is struggling to follow her father. It is a simple premise, a father and daughter living off the grid, a simple mistake and chance encounter changes everything, they are on the run, the daughter wants to remain in one place, while the father wants to keep going, it has good coming-of-age and back-to-nature themes, and the performances of the two leads are fantastic, overall it is a simplistic and interesting drama. Very good!",Leave No Trace
4,george.schmidt,Foster and McKenzie deliver Oscar worthy performances. One of the year's best films.,10,4 July 2018,"LEAVE NO TRACE (2018) **** Ben Foster, Thomasin McKenzie, Dana Millican, Jeff Kober, Dale Dickey. Excellent drama about a father/daughter relationship on the fringes of society with Foster and McKenzie delivering Oscar worthy performances as a damaged veteran and his coming of age daughter who both seek to make their family work at any costs. Filmmaker Debra Granik, who co-adapted the screenplay with Anne Rosellini based on Peter Rock's novel ""My Abandonment"", elicits heartfelt performances, tough choices and matter-of-fact reality of how inhumanity to man is perhaps the greatest sin. One of the year's best films.",Leave No Trace
5,evanston_dad,"The Anti-""Captain Fantastic""",8,14 December 2018,"For those of you who are still trying to wash the dreadful taste of ""Captain Fantastic"" out of your mouths, I might suggest giving ""Leave No Trace"" a try.Both are films about dads who decide to live off the grid and take their children with them. But whereas ""Captain Fantastic"" was a glib, smug, and simplistic middle finger to ""The Man,"" ""Leave No Trace"" is quiet, thoughtful, and compassionate. But most importantly, the child in ""Leave No Trace"" exists as a full-bodied human being comprised of equal parts loyalty and personal will, rather than the robotic ciphers that were the children in ""Captain Fantastic.""The always reliable Ben Foster plays the dad, a veteran suffering from PTSD who has lost the ability or interest -- or both -- in functioning within the confines of American society. He and his daughter, played in an excellent breakout performance by a young actress named Thomasin McKenzie, are living as nomads in an Oregon state park when the movie opens, but are arrested and funneled into social services. The dad can't cope and wants to continue their transient existence, but the daughter likes the taste of normalcy she gets and begins to assert her own needs and demands. The film is sympathetic to the plight of homeless Americans in general and homeless veterans in particular, but it's also careful to depict the services in place to help them as well meaning and kind as well. This film is not a diatribe against selling out to bourgeois America, but rather a character study about two people who have very different ideas about how to assimilate to a world that can at different times seem both welcoming and hostile.Director Debra Granik brought us ""Winter's Bone,"" another somber film about people living on the fringes. But unlike that film, the world portrayed in ""Leave No Trace"" is much kinder. The two main characters find no end of people who are willing to help in both small and big ways; it's their own limitations and reservations that get in the way.I've read lots of user reviews of this movie that complain about how unrealistic it is that the film is full of so many compassionate people. How depressing that so many think this way, and it makes me wonder where they live and what their lives are like. Because this movie resembles the America I actually experience on a day to day basis much more than it does the America I see coming at me from the news and social media -- an America full of basically decent people who don't want trouble but who are willing to lend a hand where they can.Grade: A",Leave No Trace
6,ferguson-6,"doing your job, saying goodbye",7,5 January 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. It seems like many more than 8 years have passed since filmmaker Debra Granik's outstanding film WINTER'S BONE exploded onto the indie scene and introduced most of us to Jennifer Lawrence (although she had been acting for 5 years prior). The talented Ms. Granik has chosen to adapt another book as her feature film follow-up, and once again nature and an independent spirit play a key role. Based on the novel ""My Abandonment"" by Peter Rock, it's the story of a father and daughter who live off the grid ... until society catches up to them.Ben Foster (always exceptional) plays Will, a war veteran and father to Tom, his teenage daughter played brilliantly by Thomasin McKenzie. The two live off the grid in the forests outside of Portland. An extended opening sequence with very little dialogue shows us their daily life: capturing rain water, cutting trees for firewood, hiding their camp site, and drilling on making themselves 'disappear' in the foliage. It's in these scenes where cinematographer Michael McDonough shines. His camera work allows us to feel as if we are in the damp forest as the sun rays peek through the trees. It's a beautiful sight despite our uneasiness towards the father-daughter situation.When Park Rangers discover them, the two enter the Social Services system, but rather than treat us to yet another uncaring and incompetent bureaucracy, director Granik allows human kindness and reasonableness to play its part. Will and Tom are moved onto a farm where she will enroll in school and he will work on a Christmas tree farm. Of course, we know that Will is not cut out for this life, though we begin to see Tom show signs of true independence and her own dreams.They make their way back into the woods and an injury - and more human kindness - has them end up in a camp with other outliers. The story really captures the conflict between a society that is obligated to educate and protect children, and the same society that has little clue how to assist veterans of war. We see folks who just want to be left alone, and others who maybe can't fit in to society - or have no interest in trying.Supporting work is provided by Dana Millican, the great Dale Dickey, and Isiah Stone (one of the kids from WINTER'S BONE). There is a believability here rarely seen on the big screen, and the love between father and daughter is something to behold. Ms. Granik says so much by saying very little, but what could be such a bleak story actually revels in the kindness to fellow man - the type of kindness which seems all too rare these days.",Leave No Trace
7,bombersflyup,Good film.,8,13 January 2019,"Leave No Trace is a unique piece of cinema, with a terrific performance from young Thomasin McKenzie.The film stays in its space, without any lofty ambition, but one of the better films in 2018 from what I've seen. The outlook's through rose-tinted glasses so to speak though.",Leave No Trace
8,phd_travel,"Selfish Dad, sweet daughter",5,2 February 2019,This selfish Dad an ex soldier with PTSD keeps his daughter in the forest with him because he can't live in society.A certain voyeuristic quality keeps the viewer interested in how the cope and touchingly rely on the kindness of strangers. The good natured daughter is sweet and it's quite touching at times.Ok for one watch.,Leave No Trace
9,christopher-underwood,how free do I want to be?,10,19 October 2020,"Excellent and unusual film set in and around the forests of Portland, Oregon. We are immediately drawn in with beautifully measured shots of the forest in both long shot and extreme close-up. The sun shines and the leaves and trees and spiders' webs attract and imbue a feeling of wellbeing. I would not say that this peace is shattered because although we are gradually shown both the good and bad of living in the wild, this is a truly nuanced piece. Everything that happens brings questions, both for the father and daughter portrayed and also us as viewers. Freedom may just be another word for nothing less to lose but can seem vital and is that willing helper likely to change the course of my life? And is that good or bad or something in-between. All life is here, as they say, even though basically we have just the two and their various encounters with nature, the rangers or fellow travellers along the way. Solid performance from Ben Foster and remarkably effective one from young Thomasin McKenzie means that from start to finish and throughout each interaction we, as well as they, are hopeful, fearful and always wary. Will this action change me and should I change or can I remain free and how free do I want to be?",Leave No Trace
10,blanbrn,"Going against the grain and living one's own way, still connection and love win.",7,19 March 2019,"""Leave No Trace"" is one of those movies as you watch you feel connection and see how some just live their own way with love and doing the best they can. The story is of Will(Ben Foster) a dad who along with his teenage daughter Tom who for years have been living off the outskirts and forests lands of Portland, Oregon seem very happy. All of a sudden their life of wilderness and peace is changed and shattered when both are put into a service type program of new housing and new ways and means to live. The new surroundings are a big change as slowly yet surely a process and journey back to their peaceful homeland begins. Overall good film of connection and it's touching with love and emotions of father and daughter love proving that bonding last forever.",Leave No Trace
11,Hellmant,There was definitely no better place to film it (obviously) than Portland.,9,13 July 2018,"'LEAVE NO TRACE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new critically acclaimed indie drama filmed in Portland, Oregon, and based on the 2009 book 'My Abandonment', by Peter Rock. It's about a father and teenage daughter that have been living off the grid in the forests of Portland, OR, for several years, when an accident suddenly forces them back into society. The film was directed by Debra Granik, and it was written by Granik and Anne Rosellini (the same duo also performed the same duties' on 2010's fantastic 'WINTER'S BONE'). The movie stars Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie. It's received unanimous rave reviews from critics so far, and it's now playing in select indie theaters, like Portland, OR.. I found it to be a really well made, interesting and touching film!Will (Foster) had been living his dream life, with his teenage daughter Tom (McKenzie), in the forests of Portland, Oregon. The two had been living off the grid, and under no one's rules or guidelines but their own, for several years. Then an accident causes them to both be discovered by the police, and they're put into social services for the first time. The two are of course not happy or comfortable at all in their new surroundings, and they begin a desperate attempt to make their way back home (to the wild). The movie is beautifully shot, and there was definitely no better place to film it (obviously) than Portland. It's also a great story, with two very likable characters. Foster gives one of the best performances of his career, in my opinion, and McKenzie is absolutely amazing for such a young and inexperienced actor (reminiscent of when Granik showed us Jennifer Lawrence's amazing talents for the first time, in 'WINTER'S BONE'). I highly recommend this movie.",Leave No Trace
12,MOscarbradley,One of the all-time great father/daughter movies.,10,25 August 2019,"Homelessness takes on a whole new meaning in Debra Granik's magnificent new film ""Leave No Trace"". Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie are brilliant as a father and his teenage daughter who choose to live wild in the woods until one day they are found and forced to conform. I mean, who would want to live as a modern day Thoreau when you can have a nice new modern home? Based on Peter Rock's novel 'My Abandonment' this is a film of real intelligence and insight, not afraid to be funny when it needs to be but also deeply moving, both a character study and a picture of an America we rarely see. It's like a Malick movie but one that moves with a somewhat greater speed and with none of the pretentious we sometimes associate with Malick. Indeed this is one of the most heartfelt films I have seen in a very long time and one of the greatest father/daughter movies in all of American cinema. Beautifully written, directed and acted down to the smallest part it's the kind of film that really deserves a mass audience and a fistful of awards.",Leave No Trace
13,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Remarkably unpredictable and, essentially, exposition-less; an affecting and engaging picture.",8,30 June 2018,"'Leave No Trace (2018)' is, remarkably, never predictable or on-the-nose. Instead, it soon settles into its own slow rhythm to provide an experience that's refreshing in its ability to show instead of tell. Often, it refrains from saying anything at all, especially during the moments in which it actually speaks volumes. This is a technique - or, rather, way of thinking - it uses to cut to the heart of its scenes and provide some incredibly raw emotional beats. Even in its 'loudest' of moments, it feels marvellously gentle and is brought to life with a steady, self-assured hand. The film is extremely engaging and has an astute ability to render its core relationship with a wonderfully tender realism, examining its father and daughter duo - as well as the former's traumatic background and scarred mental-state - brilliantly and not always blatantly. This, again, plays into its pretty much perfect 'show, don't tell' mentality and allows you to piece together what's going on behind our core players' eyes. It allows for an empathetic and emotive picture that impacts you in essentially every sequence, especially those towards its devastating yet somewhat inevitable end. Overall, the movie is actually highly enjoyable, and affecting, because of this emotional impact. 8/10",Leave No Trace
14,ThomasDrufke,What is Home?,8,2 August 2018,"Perhaps no other film in 2018 has exemplified true human emotion like Leave no Trace. It's immensely impressive how well director Debra Granik manages to make these characters feel like real people, even if you don't know anyone who lives out in the woods full time. I mean really, the location isn't necessarily important, what's important is that they have a home and that home was taken from them while another home is forced upon them. That's essentially the central part of the film, what's home to you may not be home to everyone. Ben Foster is unsurprisingly brilliant as is his daughter in the film, Thomasin McKenzie, who most certainly draws comparisons to Jennifer Lawrence (another Granik alum). Incredibly powerful and impeccably visceral, Leave no Trace is undoubtedly a film that will leave a trace come Oscar season.8.0/10",Leave No Trace
15,gbill-74877,Touching,8,23 April 2020,"Such a gentle, accepting film, told with restraint and authenticity. Nothing is overstated. We never know the extent of this guy's PTSD, as all we see is slight cringing when a helicopter passes overhead, and there are no grand flashbacks or exaggerations. It's just a man in pain, not able to fit in with the conventional way of doing things, and through a combination of his past and what seems to be a streak of Henry David Thoreau, eschewing technology in favor of a simple, natural life. Of course, unlike Thoreau, he's got a daughter, so even as we feel for him, we can't help but feel for her too, as it's clear she wants stability and some of the normal things in life. Their relationship is amazing and yet troubling. Both actors, Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie turn in deeply soulful performances, and McKenzie in particular seems one to watch for.Even as it looks like they're about to be separated and put into an inhuman machine (my god, that test with 400+ questions!), there are so many kind people in this film. The social workers are truly looking out for them, more than one person gives them a place to stay, several ask to ensure McKenzie isn't being victimized, and they get medical treatment when injured. However, we do see inhumanity when the makeshift homes of other vets are destroyed by a faceless guy operating a bulldozer.Director (and co-writer) Debra Granik did a great job in telling this story. There is nuance and ambiguity in what's happening, and the sense that the way things are between father and daughter is both magical and yet not sustainable. The film puts out emotions in a blender while never lowering itself to easy, cloying moments. The ending is fantastic, and it's a very fitting closing shot.",Leave No Trace
16,Cineanalyst,Walden,7,27 May 2020,"What some may consider slow and uneventful, ""Leave No Trace"" is one of the most serene motion pictures I've seen in some time. It was a welcome rest given that the last few movies I've seen were action-packed sci-fi or, otherwise, troubling pictures reflecting the real-life pandemic as of this writing. A lot of horror films. Too many aliens and zombies. Far removed from all of that, this picture features a father and daughter who practice social distancing regardless of any threat of viral infection. Although, it becomes apparent that the father suffers from PTSD after their hermit lifestyle of living in the woods is interrupted by police and social services, and he's unable to cope within society. Somehow, the picture manages to remain both peaceful and restless--sometimes at the same time.I also appreciate that the filmmakers didn't bother to spell everything out, or to rush the plot--what there is of a plot, that is. The picture reflects the characters' wilderness ethics. It doesn't proceed at the pace of the modern, urban, or even most of the rural, world. It meanders, pauses and leaves much unsaid. It may be as good as any other to be a narrative film akin to Henry David Thoreau's book ""Walden,"" with a bit of ""Civil Disobedience"" thrown in. I saw another reviewer criticizing the supposed lack of realism of the characters in the movie being overwhelmingly nice, but that's a reflection of the transcendentalism of the likes of Thoreau, that people are inherently good. According to such a philosophy, it's nature that preserves this goodness, while society and its institutions may be corrupting influences. Yet, while I enjoy an escape such as in ""Leave No Trace,"" or back in my school days when I read Thoreau, my sympathies here are ultimately with the daughter. Some modernity and socialization isn't necessarily bad; I am someone who posts on the Internet their opinions of movies, after all.",Leave No Trace
17,cricketbat,"A slow, but well-acted drama",7,15 July 2020,"It's easy to believe what happens in Leave No Trace because Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie do such a good job making you believe their characters are real people. The story is pretty slow, and I can't say I was completely satisfied with the ending, but I was impressed with how the film was able to say so much with very little dialogue. I'm glad I ran across this movie.",Leave No Trace
18,secondtake,"Smart and remarkable in the details, with a stellar McKenzie as leading actress",7,19 January 2019,"Leave No Trace (2018)You might think this movie amounts to too little, tracing the father and daughter as they get caught after years living off the land in the woods. They struggle with exposure to civilization, and the movie becomes about their relationaship above all. Then, gradually, it becomes about the girl as she enters her mid teens and she knows her father is somehow mentally off the grid.
And this is the main pleasure, watching the amazing acting of the leading actress, Thomasin McKenzie. It is her struggle to find herself in a very bizarre circumstance that makes you feel for her and her father, too. Remarkable.
There are times when I did wonder if the movie had enough going on, or if it simplified things in a way that was not helpful, but other times I was completely on board, and empathetic. A really strong packaging of a seemingly simple idea. The director, Debra Granik, makes the most of her starting material (a book) and the screenplay (which is limited, but handled well, partly written by Granik).
Ben Foster as the dad is understated to the point of being slightly drab, but I think this is smart. (I knew his acting first from Six Feet Under long ago, and he's been a steady actor since, never quite breaking through.) He's a perfect support of McKenzie.
See this? Yes, if you like quiet movies. There are a couple of moments when you think the plot is going to get horrifying to a point of being unacceptable, but Granik does not abuse the viewer. That's all I can say without a spoiler alert.",Leave No Trace
19,851222,Great characters study movie,10,26 July 2019,"Greetings from Lithuania.In ""Leave No Trace"" (2018) we see a great study of two characters. First of all, ""Leave No Trace"" is a character study movie, a very, very good one and more. They are both very different, although they kinda look similar, but i won't go into spoilers here. What i loved about this movie, which as i read is based on a novel, which itself was based on real story, were superb directing, very nuances writing and mesmerizing performances by both leads, especially by a Thomasin McKenzie. She is character which we kinda don't even see as a formed yet and this period of life and circumstances are shaping here future.Overall, ""Leave No Trace"" kinda left me very pleasantly surprised of how not by a book this movie was. We do not see places, people this movie shows in a mainstream cinema. This movie is not for everyone, possibly, but if you like slow but powerful character study dramas, you shouldn't miss this movie by any chance.",Leave No Trace
20,westsideschl,Worthy of Ten,10,22 October 2018,"Producers, director, script writers are all female which possibly lends the script to being more attuned to the sensitive relations between father & daughter. A mostly non-verbal emotional connection beautifully acted.
Background:
We have a PTSD anxious fearful ex-soldier w/teen daughter living off the grid in a semi-remote Oregon rural park setting. The love & trust shown by the characters in that environs is acted to perfection. In a scene dad visits a VA hospital to pick up his PTSD drugs, Benzodiazepine & Prazosin, but sells them (in part because they are ineffective) to fund their lifestyle. An interesting sidelight, while his daughter is waiting in the lobby, she visits a veterans display noting a safety gunlock device to help prevent suicides. Later, as expected they are chased from their encampment. You sense that the daughter needs a secure stable social setting. She says, ""What is wrong with you is not wrong with me!"" Followed by an image illustrating dad's state-of-mind. He is shown walking along a path, but leaves it to make a new path.What was also real in this script is that the police, VA, social services & other people were not portrayed as villainous (an easy bad guy plot hook to make), but caring helpful supporters.",Leave No Trace
21,nairtejas,MAMI Review: Leave No Trace (3 Stars),3,1 November 2018,"Debra Grenik's Leave No Trace seems like a self-indulgent father-daughter drama set in a gimmicky urban forest to send the point about the ""importance of one's roots"" across. Unfortunately, it is. The duo's peaceful yet suspended life turns upside down when they are arrested and asked to stop living in the woods. And we are supposed to use this to understand the dynamic relationship between a father and a daughter who he is ought to provide. The 100-minute drama with absolutely zero spike in thrills is a snoozefest that has the power to put you to sleep despite Ben Foster giving you the stare treatment more than once. I really liked the brevity in the dialogues and the cliches that director Grenik so masterfully uses to narrate her bland story that almost felt like it was picked up from a children's story book. Reason: zero character development. Other than the shots of the exotic locations and some great camera work, I don't see any relevance or matter in Leave No Trace. There are a lot of such films based in forests that are coming out recently and this one here is a testament to the fact that not every such film is good.

22,Thanos_Alfie,A beautiful movie...,6,23 December 2018,"""Leave No Trace"" is a Drama movie in which we watch a father and his thirteen-year-old daughter living in a park in Portland, Oregon. They live there for a long period of time and they are happy with their lives. After an incident, they are put into social services and from there in a house. But they don't feel it like their own home and once again set off on a difficult and exhausting journey back to their wild homeland.I liked this movie because it had an interesting plot and very good interpretations. The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that I wasn't able to connect with the character of the father since the movie didn't give us a lot of information about his past and was given emphasis on the result of it. It would be good if there were some flashbacks in his past in order for the audience to be able to connect with the character and understand even better his PTSD. I liked very much the interpretations of Ben Foster's who played as Will the father and Thomasin McKenzie's who played as Tom his daughter. I also believe that it was the best interpretation of Ben Foster so far.In conclusion, I have to say that ""Leave No Trace"" is a good movie to watch, with many great scenes which I am sure that you will enjoy and afterward you will think about many things or even discuss with each other about them. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because it's a movie from which you can take many things and you will learn how to understand some special people and even how to treat them.",Leave No Trace
23,eddie_baggins,A solid if unremarkable film,6,22 October 2018,"The last time talented filmmaker Debra Granik stepped behind the camera she delivered fantastic results with the Oscar nominated 2010 film Winter's Bone, a haunting dramatic thriller that launched the career of now megastar Jennifer Lawrence.It's taken 8 year's for Granik to come back to the director's chair for a feature film and with her adaptation of Peter Rock's book My Abandonment, Leave No Trace allows Granik to showcase once more that she's a director of note, even if Trace leaves a little to be desired as a cold but well-acted and shot tale of a father looking for a way for himself and his teenage daughter to live outside of the norms of society.At the time of writing, Trace holds an incredible 100% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes after 190 reviews, making it one of the best reviewed movies of not only 2018 but the last few year's and it's not hard to see why, as the film would be hard to hate thanks to Granik's stoic work behind the camera and the impressive performances of stars Ben Foster as PTSD suffering father Will and relative newcomer Thomasin McKenzie as Will's daughter Tom.The problem with Trace is it's a hard film to fall in love with, Will in particular as a character is a hard person to agree with, as his constant refusal to allow himself and Tom to live a normal life or a life that offers more than suffering in freezing conditions camping in the wilderness becomes more insufferable as the runtime wears one and Tom herself begins to understand that her lifestyle and upbringing isn't all it could be as her needs and wants begin to change.It's certainly not a far-fetched example of one broken human trying to come to terms with their condition and find a way to live but it doesn't make it any more tolerable, holding the film back from its other more noteworthy elements.As she did with Lawrence's turn in Winter's Bone, Granik unearths a fantastic turn from young McKenzie who steals the show from the always solid Foster. Tom is a considerate, balanced and thoughtful soul and McKenzie does a brilliant job of examining her role in the story. It's the type of performance that suggests the young actress will have a bright future in the industry should she indeed continue to be involved in the system.Final Say -A slowly paced and fuss-free affair, Leave No Trace is a solid return to the feature film landscape for Granik that includes a great performance from its young star but it's a cold and stoic drama that fails to reach any grand emotional connections.3 hide and seek drills out of 5",Leave No Trace
24,howard.schumann,About the power of self creation,9,22 July 2018,"Based on the novel ""My Abandonment"" by Peter Rock and adapted from a screenplay by Granik and Anne Rosellini, Debra Granik's Leave No Trace is the story of Will (Ben Foster, ""Hostiles""), a troubled army veteran suffering from PTSD who lives with his teenage daughter Tom (Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie, ""The Changeover"") in a camp they built themselves in the woods near Portland, Oregon. Like Granik's 2010 film ""Winter's Bone"" that chronicled the lives of people living on the margins in the rural Ozarks of Missouri, Leave No Trace is an uncompromising look at a non-conforming father and his young daughter living off the grid, doing their best to survive in a society they do not understand or wish to be a part of.Opening in a heavily forested area in a large public park, cinematographer Michael McDonough (""Sunset Song"") creates a mood of isolation far removed from the world of television, computers, and smart phones. Will and daughter Tom, remarkably performed by newcomer McKenzie, chop wood, play chess, cook their own meals, and train themselves to avoid being detected. There are no flashbacks and little backstory and it is left to us to guess how long they have lived there, what Will's military trauma was like, or what happened to Tom's mother. What is certain, however, is that they are not on a summer vacation. When they go into the city for groceries, the sudden contrast between the forest and the shrieking sounds of city life is instantly jarring. Buying groceries, however, is not all Will has come for.Visiting the VA hospital, he picks up prescriptions for painkillers which he sells for cash to hangers on living on the outskirts of the park. It is his only means of support. His independent way of life is threatened, however, when Tom is inadvertently seen by a passing jogger who alerts the authorities and they are forced out of hiding by the police and their sniffing dogs. Separated, Tom is sent to a detention center for young girls, while Will must take a series of psychological tests where he has to confront thoughts and feelings that he had long suppressed. Before being torn apart, Will reassures his daughter that ""we can still have our own thoughts,"" but it is unconvincing.Though they are being ""processed"" and are in effect beholden to the system, Granik avoids the kind of scapegoating depicted in films such as the recent ""I, Daniel Blake,"" which shows all government workers as ogres. Here they are real people who treat Will and Tom with respect and a grudging admiration. Father and daughter are eventually reunited on a farm where Will helps the owner Mr. Walters (Jeff Kober, ""Sully"") harvest Christmas trees. As they settle into their new environment, Tom learns how to ride a bike, they attend a church service, and Tom meets a young boy (Isaiah Stone, ""American Honey"") who invites her to a 4-H meeting where they are taught to train rabbits.In another situation where Will is healing from a severe foot injury, Dale (Dale Dickey, ""Hell or High Water""), a local woman, shows Tom how to approach a bee hive safely, an exercise in trust that Tom demonstrates for her dad. Though she is beginning to like it, Will is becoming increasingly uncomfortable with living in a community that requires him to give of himself to others. Still disturbed by night terrors, the look on his face suggests that he is just biding his time until he can return to the woods. Fueled by the atmospheric original score of Dickon Hinchliffe (""Little Men""), Leave No Trace unfolds without manipulation or sentimentality. Unlike last year's ""Captain Fantastic"" which romanticized living outside of ""the system,"" it is less of a statement about freedom from a system that one deems oppressive than about a man who has found a way to cope but is psychologically closed off from others, unable or unwilling to engage in the demands of accepted social interaction.The film does not exploit its characters or engage in ""us against the world"" messaging but reveals its inner truths with restraint and authenticity. Rather than showing the effects of a society in freefall, Granik makes us aware that there is still kindness left in the world. Though we can empathize with Will and Tom, we know too well that the universe is governed by impermanence and that eventually we all will have to let go of our attachments. To quote philosopher Henri Bergson, ""To exist is to change, to change is to mature, to mature is to go on creating oneself endlessly."" Leave No Trace is not only a film about survival but also about the power of self creation.",Leave No Trace
25,TheMovieDiorama,Leave No Trace poignantly flourishes in depicting a dynamically engrossing family bond.,9,5 July 2018,"Indie dramas just keep getting better as the years go by. The freedom to be experimental whilst conveying a captivating story makes for a vastly enthralling cinematic experience than the average Hollywood drama. It's no different here, with director Granik perfectly balancing emotional heft with relentless drama. A father and his young daughter live in isolation within a shrouded urban forest, where one mistake leads them into being found by the local authorities. The eloquence and minimalism in Granik's screenplay allows the story to be told visually. The peaceful environment and rural American culture juxtapose the bustling highways of urban society. Yet they complement each other to create an ecosystem for humanity. The same is applied to this relationship. The father, fearful of being discovered and conforming to the aristocracy of modern civilisation, contrasts with his daughter who yearns for environmental stability. After experiencing a glimpse of normality, she envies them. However, it's the bond between them that truly captivated me. They never argue. They never bicker. They understand one another. Mistakes are forgiven, opportunities are seized. It was honestly beautiful to watch. Foster (who is becoming rather commendable with his work) and McKenzie were sensational together, feeding emotions through just their eyes. Granik utilises plenty of horizonal techniques to illustrate these two characters amongst the overwhelmingly luscious foliage. McDonough's cinematography was gorgeous, bountiful of green filters and natural lighting. My only gripe is the lack of backstory, particularly with the mother, which would've elevated the emotional response for the story's conclusion. But what I really appreciate is the unobtrusive approach to what could've been a sensationalistic plot, and the lack of pretentiousness further cements Granik as a mature director who really should be directing more films. A near perfect drama with outstanding performances that deserves your undivided attention.",Leave No Trace

So endearing and heartbreaking. When she's showing her dad the beehive, how you can feel the warmth of the hive-community...it's incredible. Great little study of both the good and the bad of the western status quo.",Leave No Trace
27,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Another soft, subtle but deeply emotional effort from Debra Granik",8,9 November 2018,"The fast-paced technology-driven world we live in is reason enough for filmmakers to gravitate to stories of detachment. There's strong thematic appeal in characters not only stripping themselves of these dependencies, but also completely removing themselves from society. Yet that's not what director Debra Granik appears to be after in ""Leave No Trace"" despite that very setup.Instead, Granik is far more interested on the central relationship of a father and teenage daughter (Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie) living out in the woods near Portland, Oregon. All is well and good off the grid until they're discovered, forcing social services to get involved, uprooting them from their home and way of life.Those who remember Granik's last film, the Oscar-nominated ""Winter's Bone,"" which she also adapted from a book with co-writer Anne Rosellini, will understand immediately why she was inspired to make this her first feature film in eight years. Both stories involve strong but vulnerable young women, focus on familial responsibility, and depict life beyond the urban horizon -- remote areas populated by folk with a simple way of life. And she tells both stories with the same lack of frills.On the dramatic spectrum, over-the-top melodrama is at one end and Granik is at the other. She goes about her filmmaking with a quiet, reflective lens, treating her characters like portrait subjects and staying open to the beauty of the locations she captures. As for conflict, not much exists, especially in ""Leave No Trace,"" and it stays at a simmer that's no less dramatic for not having exploded in verbal anger or physicality.Such a mild-mannered approach places great responsibility on the actors to convey the weight of their feelings without much to stand on. Foster, a long-underrated talent, and McKenzie, an unknown, somehow convey a parent-child dynamic whose foundation is unlike any other.As the easier character to empathize with, McKenzie has the stronger emotional tie to the audience and she gives Tom a remarkable combination of poise, fear, curiosity and compassion. That she shows a lot of promise as an actor is no surprise; this is, after all, the same director (and casting duo, Kerry Barden and Paul Schnee) who launched Jennifer Lawrence's career.Foster, however, has the difficult task of portraying a war veteran who is shaken but also non-emotive and living in denial. His character could easily be cold and mean, or a giant pity party, and Foster toes that line right along with the script.In general, ""Leave No Trace"" is so subdued that its emotional moments will come as a surprise. One could just as easily give up on watching it as be moved to tears by the end. That's Granik's power as a filmmaker -- to deliver catharsis not by squeezing the tube, but patiently rolling it up from the bottom. There's a realism she brings to storytelling that the escapist viewer won't have the patience for, but she's proven the payoff for those who can focus and be open to the less noticeable elements of filmmaking beyond forced dramatic stimulus is well worth it.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Reading the many other Imdb reviews this movie is definitely NOT suited for those who expect a fast paced, suspenseful survival movie. Nothing much happens and the general mood of this movie is downbeat and sober. Not many will like that, although I really valued the tranquil, slowburning nature of this movie.The trailer sparkled my imagination, because it's many people's fantasy to go live in the wild, but few dare ever take that leap. One father did decide to go live in the woods and he raised his daughter, while living in nature. However the real world never is far away and the father gets arrested and put under supervision with his daughter in a normal house with a job. What will these new ""normal"" surroundings trigger inside the father, who was used to live in isolation in nature?Slowburning, tranquil and touching. Good acting performances by Ben Foster (father). Very touching end, which made me give it 8 stars.

29,paul-allaer,"One of the best movies of the year, period",9,14 July 2018,"""Leave No Trace"" (2018 release; 110 min.) brings the story of an army veteran with PTSD (Will) and his 13 or 14 yr. old daughter (Tom). As the movie opens, we get to know Will and Tom, who are living off the grid, literally, in a large park near Portland. They are chopping wood, tending to the fire, fixing a bite to eat. No mention of where the mother is. Then some days later, disaster strikes: Tom is spotted by someone, who call the park rangers and Portland Police. It's not long before Will and Tom are located and taken in for further questioning (apparently it's illegal to ""live"" on public parks). At this point we are less than 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the long overdue return from writer-director Debra Granik, who some years ago brought the outstanding ""Winter's Bone"" (Granik did an under-the-radar documentary between these 2 movies). Here Granik looks at the impact of PTDS on an army veteran and his daughter. The veteran battles demons in his sleep, and restlessness when he's awake, causing them to move from part to park. This is a plot-heavy movie, so I really don't want to say much more than that. Just watch. Ben Foster brings an accomplished performance as Will. But the show is really stolen by the astonishing (and breakout) performance by relative newcomer Thomasin McKenzie as Tom, the daughter who wants to support so badly. Surely this is just the beginning that we've seen of her, and I can't wait to see what she'll do next. Last but certainly not least, the movie's photography (in Oregon) is colorful and lush, just eye-candy. Please note that this movie is rated PG, but in my opinion should not be viewed by kids younger than, say, 12. Not because there is anything ""wrong"" in the movie, but I guarantee you that young kids will simply be bored. So PG rated, but not really a kids film.""Leave No Trace"" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Saturday matinee screening where I saw this at was PACKED, I am very happy to report (the 95 degree weather nay have had something to do with that). ""Leave No Trace"" is one of those rare movies that is 100% certified fresh Rotten Tomatoes. Yes, it is that good! If you are in the mood for a wonderful character study of an army veteran with PTSD with his young daughter, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion/ For me, ""Leave No Trace"" is a WINNER all the way.",Leave No Trace

31,jtindahouse,A tough watch about a very broken person,8,28 September 2018,"At about the halfway point in 'Leave No Trace' I thought to myself, not much has really happened yet has it? And then the more I thought about it I realised a lot had actually happened, it had just been presented so naturally that it didn't feel like much. This is a hauntingly dark story that I suspect will stay with people long after they've seen it. A lot is left up to the imagination in terms of character back story and I think that is one of the most powerful elements to this film. We are never explicitly told what happened to make this man the way he is, and so we can only think that it was truly awful.Ben Foster blew me away in this film. I know he's a great actor, but I've always had trouble connecting with his characters in the films he has chosen. This one was different though. For me this was easily his best performance to date. His pain is the audience's pain. New Zealand girl Thomasin McKenzie also put in a very strong showing. She showed maturity and acting skills well beyond her years. It's great to see New Zealand actors taking the world by storm.This is a slow paced film there is no doubt about that. It's a film that does require some patience admittedly, but if you're anything like me you'll be glued to the screen the whole time regardless. The details are what make this film. It is artfully created and will break your heart in half if you have one. I'm a big fan of this film and would happily recommend it.",Leave No Trace
32,Turfseer,Noted indie director again romanticizes backwoods characters in a tale of civilization and its discontents,5,18 January 2019,"You might remember director Deborah Granik, whose backwoods drama Winter's Bone, set in Appalachia, garnered quite a bit of attention back in 2010 including Academy Award nominations for best picture and screenplay. She's back with another earnest ""off the beaten"" track tale, this time focusing on a PTSD afflicted army veteran who chooses to raise his 13 year old daughter out in the woods, as virtual hermits from civilization.
The protagonists are Will (Ben Foster) and daughter Tom (Thomasin McKenzie) who, according to one of the DVD extras, received extensive coaching in survival skills by a wilderness survival coach. There is a good deal of exposition before the inciting incident that reveals the two actors became well versed in these methods-including lighting fires with stones and building lean-tos, to protect against the elements. Will occasionally takes trips to town to buy food, and gets his money by illegally selling his PTSD medications.
The narrative doesn't really get going until father and daughter are spotted by a jogger and then removed from their habitat (in a public park) by police officers. They are then brought to a social services agency and end up at a Christmas tree farm in rural Oregon. In exchange for room and board, Will grudgingly works at the farm while Tom is ordered to attend school and also interacts with kids at a 4-H club.
Granik unfortunately takes a way too sympathetic view of Will whose decision to expose his daughter to the slings and arrows of an unforgiving natural environment borders on child abuse. Granik, an academic by trade, is all about bemoaning man's fall from grace due to alienation from nature. In some respects, she implies that Will is actually noble in his quest to turn his back on the comforts of civilization.
With his PTSD, Will is drawn as a sympathetic character. You would think that such a character would have an explosive temper but he never seems to get cross with his daughter despite her constant entreaties to return to their temporary home at the farm. What's more (aside from the police) everyone who comes in contact with Will is eager to lend a helping hand. This includes the social worker who prevents Will from being arrested for neglect and helps them find lodging at the hospitable Christmas tree farm, a kindly truck driver who grants Will and Tom's request to hitch a ride despite doubting their story as to where they're headed, and a woman who owns property in a trailer park who allows them to stay for months in a trailer, accepting only a deposit, instead of the full rental price.
Despite the lack of verisimilitude, we viewers still wish to learn of the ultimate fate of the two principals. Will Tom return to civilization or remain with her father out in the wilderness? Once the pair decide to flee from the Christmas farm, they again find themselves in even more harsh conditions, in the higher altitude of Washington State. After taking refuge in an abandoned cabin, Will leaves Tom in an attempt to find some food but doesn't return. Tom finds her father unconscious in the woods and manages to find some locals who help bring him to the previously alluded to trailer park.
At this point, the action slows down as Will must recover from his injuries. Like an earlier aside in the film involving a dancing church group, Granik introduces a subplot about a beekeeper who teaches Tom the intricacies of bee keeping, which undoubtedly broadens the young girl's horizons and experiences of the natural world. It's a pleasant diversion that has little to do with the main plot and probably would have been better utilized in a documentary on the subject.
We finally arrive at the rather anti-climactic denouement. And that involves Will's decision to return to the backwoods and leave Tom to fend for herself at the trailer park, which she has grown comfortable living in. One realizes just how one note a character Will is at film's end, with his continuing alienation from everyone. Little of this alienation is explained at any point during the film, except for allusions to some trouble while in the army and an unexplained separation from his ex-wife, Tom's mom.
See Leave No Trace for McKenzie's performance; she is compelling as the devoted daughter who yearns for a normal adolescence. More problematic is Ben Foster as Will-he does his best particularly in the scenes that find him showing off his survivalist skills. But Foster is saddled by Granik's (previously alluded to) one-note characterization, which may dampen your enthusiasm for this particular project. There are a few nice things about this film particularly in its naturalistic cinematography, but ultimately it's the weak plotting that drops its overall rating down a peg or two.",Leave No Trace

Leave No Trace is about a haunted vet (Ben Foster) and his teenage daughter, who live in the middle of a public park in the Pacific Northwest. They survive almost completely off the grid, occasionally making forays into the nearby city (Portland, Ore.) for food and other supplies. And they change locations every so often so that they don't draw attention. Dad has taught daughter much, including starting a fire with rocks, catching rainwater for later use, and hiding possessions almost in plain sight. One day, though, they are spotted by a jogger and taken in by police, setting off a chain of events that leads to them getting a sort-of home of their own while Dad works for a Christmas tree farmer and his daughter Tom gets formal schooling and enjoys the company of others. But Dad's itinerant ways and PTSD leave him unwilling and unable to deal with the rules and control of others. Not only is Foster's work here among the best he's ever done (and that's saying something), but Thomasin McKenzie is a huge find as daughter Tom. This girl is amazingly talented and should have a bright future in Hollywood.",Leave No Trace

36,jimbo-53-186511,Mind-numbingly boring,2,17 April 2019,"A father and daughter are living out in the woods in Portland, Oregon seemingly happy with their unorthodox lifestyle choice. However, when the daughter is spotted in the woods, the pair end up being captured by rangers who attempt to re-introduce them back into regular society (putting them on a programme that provides them with a home etc). But how will father and daughter adapt to their newfound existence and what price will this have on their relationship?Aside from the title of the film being more fitting to a crime thriller or murder mystery, Leave No Trace is excruciatingly slow and so frustratingly underwritten that's it's hard to imagine why so many people have given it a mostly positive review/feedback. It's current 7.2 average IMDB rating is mind-boggling.For a start, it's a film that, narratively, leaves all the work to the viewer; there's no explanation as to why father and daughter choose to live the way they live? Yes we learn that the daughter's mother dies somehow, but what happened? Was this the catalyst that caused the pair to shun a normal lifestyle? I think there is one occasion when the narrative suggests its turning a corner in order to enlighten the viewer as to why father and daughter behave in this manner, but it's never elaborated on which in my opinion makes the whole journey feel like a waste of time. Some may like the narrative ambiguity and the fact that the film allows them to draw their own conclusions and think for themselves, but personally I just find it lazy.Another failing with this film is that it fails to make the principal characters interesting; spending around 90 minutes in the company of 2 bland characters with sketchy motivations coupled with dreary dialogue was not the shrewdest of moves on the part of the writers. I'm not lying when I say that there are no genuinely interesting or emotional moments in this film's entirety. In fact the only time it comes close to achieving one of these moments is when the father busts his leg, but this was brought on by his own stupidity which negated much of the sympathy that I should have felt for him.Foster and McKenzie as father and daughter respectively do the best they can, but when they're seemingly asked to portray lifeless and dull characters you can hardly blame the pair of them for not putting in strong performances. The only strong point really lies with the Cinematography, but that's faint praise when all is said and done.FINAL SUMMARY; For insomniacs only.",Leave No Trace

We are sympathetic to both protagonists, but are eventually rooting for the daughter to make the inevitable emotional break. The film reminded me a bit of ""Into the Wild"", another fine breaking away movie that featured another young person who makes an emotional break from his ho-hum life. Although that film ended in tragedy, this one appears to be headed for a much better conclusion in life.

A father & his daughter live in a national park in Oregon surviving off the land while the dad, a returned veteran from an unnamed war, makes money selling his meds to a contact. The daughter learns the ropes & keeps their camp self sustained (they have a decent water collection method & forage the land for mushrooms & things to keep their bellies full) but the biggest fear for both of them is being discovered by the powers that be which happens when a hiker sees the girl (she quickly hides) & reports her to the authorities. Once the law gets their hands on them, they try to do the right thing & reintegrate them into society by providing lodging on a farmer's property, played by genre vet Jeff Kober, as long as he works the land (Kober runs a Christmas tree estate) but as papers need to be signed (the daughter's education comes into focus), the father bolts w/the daughter & they end up hitchhiking up North finding an abandoned cabin as a transitory shelter but when the dad falls in a trench (he'd gone out for supplies), the daughter finds him & flags down some people for help. The last section of the film finds the family holed in a RV reserve where a bunch of like minded residents live as simply & independently as they do which excites the daughter who is now having pangs to set down roots. Will the father acquiesce or drag her back into the wilderness? Ben Foster (who used to be on Six Feet Under) & newcomer Thomasin McKenzie are exceptional in their roles as the dialogue is sparse (Foster lobbied to cut much of his dialogue away from his role) w/actions speaking louder than words since the film is an examination of forward movement. Granik again tells a tale of a deeply individualistic woman fighting nature & convention to live her life in a system made of rules & regulations. The naturalistic setting also lends ample character to the narrative as we see the hypocrisy of a nation which provides itself on the 'can do' spirit of its people only to be told 'no' when encroachment becomes a nuisance.

43,jadepietro,Finding a Place Called Home,8,31 July 2018,"GRADE: B THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Two excellent performances elevate a fine film that diffuses its storytelling with nice atmospheric visuals but too few words.JIM'S REVIEW: Leave No Trace is a heartfelt story about a destitute father and his loyal daughter. This independent film is told straightforwardly and its theme is current. Will (Ben Foster) Is a war veteran suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, and wanting no help at all. His loving daughter, Tom (Thomasin McKenzie), is homeless, unknowingly suffering as well, due to her father's on-going illness. They survive daily together, in the wilderness of a national park in their makeshift campsite, avoiding any human contact or interference and living their lives under nature's glory.When they are indeed discovered by authorities and placed in the welfare system, both and Tom react in differ ways. Will has adjustment issues dealing with this new physical world and its limitations of personal freedom while his daughter conforms to all of the conveniences of this unknown modern world. As Tom ventures out to meet other caring people and gain new worldly experiences, she senses awe and wonderment with a thirst for knowledge. This begins to complicate her life as her father grows more unwilling to accept change. (In this case, the movie follows a similar plot-line with another fine independent film, Matt Ross' 2016 Captain Fantastic.)Leave No Trace is directed and co-written by Debra Granik (Winter's Bone) with assured skill. The director is in familiar impoverished rural territory with her characters and settings. Much of the film relies on compelling visuals and the nuanced performances of the two leads to successfully convey its storytelling. Yet one wishes her screenplay (along with screenwriter Anne Rosellini) would have also stated its message with more expressive words. Dialog is strong but minimal and adding further conversational dialog would have given the film more impact about this important subject while highlighting their familial conflict rather than implying the sudden rift between parent and child.The story's narrative structure actually depicts two caring people trapped in the political red tape of social services and governmental bureaucracy. Yet the film avoids condemning or delving into the insensitivity of the system. Instead, the director focuses on the human drama. On this level, the film resonates. (Actually, the repeated charity and kindness of strangers seemed oddly out of touch with reality to this reviewer. That no one, besides workers assigned to this case, reacted negatively to this child's welfare is the film's chief flaw.)As written, one never questions their love. Immediately, moviegoers may disagree with his parental decision-making, but understand the immense mental toll and confusion that prevents Will from changing their condition. What is best for the child weighs heavily throughout the film. Ultimately, it is the acting by these two actors which create such a convincing bond. Their understated portrayals become the essence of the film. Making an impressive film debut is Ms. McKenzie as Tom and this teenage actress is wonderful in the role. Her performance is quiet yet devastating in its complexity. Ben Foster as her dad gives his well drawn character an underlying sadness while providing strength in his father figure role. Their interactions together are subtle and quite moving. Strong support also comes from Dale Dickey, Dana Millican, and Jeff Kober in minor roles.Leave No Trace takes its relevant subject and exposes the human side of the issue. Ms. Granik's film creates a mostly realistic and extremely touching tale about a man at war with himself and his daughter trying to escape the sins of the father without wounding herself in the emotional crossfire.",Leave No Trace

46,areatw,Engaging drama let down by poor plot and character development,6,31 March 2019,"'Leave No Trace' is a subtle and engaging drama with some strong acting performances and stunning cinematography, but it is ultimately let down by its thin plot, lack of a background story, and poor character development. For a film supposedly about a veteran suffering from PTSD, this was never properly explored or even explained. Everything happens 'in the moment' and we know very little about the characters and their backstory.This is a very slow film, and while this in itself isn't necessarily a bad thing, it does feel like the film is going nowhere. There are lots of overly long, drawn-out scenes where nothing of significance or interest happens. The relationship between father and daughter is one of the more rewarding aspects of the film, but even then I thought 'Captain Fantastic' did this more effectively and was much better at delivering its message. Overall, an okay drama film let down by poor plot and character development.",Leave No Trace

He lives with his young teenaged daughter Tom (Thomasin McKenzie) in a large forest just outside Portland, Oregon. As they are living on public land illegally (Will's choice due to his social skills problems), the pair must hide themselves in order to live off the land in isolation.A question that arises during the film: is the viewer given too little information about Will or just enough? The fact that this could cause a debate is a favourable factor for this fine film. Will certainly is an enigma and the viewer gets only the slightest hints of his make-up with rare references to his past. But this adds to the mystery of his character. Another compliment to the film is that it very ably handles a rare but relevant topic that is too often avoided: PTSD of war veterans. It also succeeds in exposing the idiocies of bureaucracy while humanizing those on the front lines of it.""Leave No Trace"" ends up as a very unusual road movie.

You see it is deep within the DNA and when you camp you get in touch with it. The five senses come alive as intended. We are introduced to living outdoors and I must say that it has its pros & cons. Staying warm, dry and getting a steady meal is presented as well as recognizing what is and is not important on a day to day basis. Makes you wonder about these billionaires and how empty their lives are. Michael Jackson couldn't even enjoy his Neverland ranch nor could Elvis Presley his, Randolph Hurst, or untold many who owned not one but several pieces of land, homes, cars, clothes and all the rest but NO REST for them. This movie doesn't make this point but it stands out for consideration. Even supporting characters live in RV's, have camp-fires and good appetites for healthy or normal food (not 5 star dining). Life remains simple and less is more. Worthy to consider in this ""rat race"" world. The bond between Dad and Daughter is lovingly and purely explored and stands as presented. Of course one can argue that Nature is the star of the show with its weather cycles, fresh water, air and no stress quality just the cycle of life doing what it is instructed to do until otherwise. We are also introduced to what it is like to have to live with the thought of having survived combat and life or death dynamics. The trauma from living through a hellish dynamic while subjective is damaging to each one differently but damaging none the less. We all know war is not normal but necessary if man is to survive. Until we all agree to agree to NO violence, one must defend themselves against the unknown. Take note of the agency that tries to help the fallen, hurting or hopeless but see the futility of it if one does not accept or go along.

Debra Granik does a magnificent job at writing and directing this adaption of Peter Rock's novel, she gave the movie this realistic feeling like we are watching a biopic as it could very well be people that have the same circumstances like Will and Tom that is played brilliantly by Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie, Ben's performance is award worthy, it's a great and important performance. The director did right with turning down the dialogue as it did feel more realistic and it also gave the actors the chance to really act and not just speak which I always enjoy.There's not many times I agree with critics now days but they are right with this movie, it's great and has some of the best and most real acting I've seen.

56,AhmedSpielberg99,"-""Everything's different now."" -""We can still think our own thoughts.""",8,30 September 2018,"The first movie that came to my mind after watching the opening scene from this movie is Captain Fantastic. While both movies share similar themes as they can be classified under the Survival Movies sub-genre, Leave No Trace is a completely different film. What makes this movie different and special is what it implies not what it shows at all. Like Rebel Without a Cause, this movie demands from the viewers to put themselves in the main characters' shoes. Without doing so, you'll not be able to relate or feel anything, and the movie would feel very bland and cold for you. Because this movie in particular stands out from the other movies of its kind due to
its non-dramatized approach to its subject matter. It feels so authentic and realistic, and that's exactly what some people find somewhat off-putting. But that wasn't, by any means, the case for me. I found this movie so moving, and I related to the characters so much.Without Debra Granik's nuanced and delicate direction this movie could have been stiff and boring. But Debra Granik added some small, yet very effective, touches to emphasize on some sweet memories, and therefore make them stuck in our heads, and, before everything, in our hearts to evoke a catharsis in the audience by the end of the movie.Both Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie delivered brilliant performances that feel as authentic as Debra Granik's serene direction. The result is a movie that massively succeeded to be heart-breaking without the slightest reliance on dramatic clichés such as the highs and lows we often see in this kind of movies.All that being said, halfway through the movie, there was a slight tendency to continue the story in a formulaic way. Fortunately, that didn't happen. But that doesn't mean that I found the first, and especially the first, and the third act more cohesive, and more original as well. With more deviling into Ben Foster's character, Will, the second act could have been not only less flawed, but also potentially the strongest among the other two acts. With these problems, I found that I understood Will state of mind more than I felt it. That said, as the movie progresses I became more and more invested in his character, hence more emotionally connected to it.What really impressed me is Thomasin McKenzie's performance. Her character, Tom, is incredibly compelling and complex, and the way we get to know her characteristics from is absolutely genius! Just from the dialogue and the naturalistic way Thomasin McKenzie responds in every single situation we know that Tom is grateful, caring, honest and very frank, and afraid of change like her father, but also has an entirely different reason for being so.Leave No Trace is, first and foremost, a deeply moving humanistic tale thanks to its unconventional and unpredictable approach to its subject matter, and the honest and authentic performances from the underrated Ben Foster, and especially from the massively talented young actress Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie.(8/10)",Leave No Trace

Directed and co-written by Debra Granik (Winter's Bone), it is a touching father-daughter story about finding one's place in the world.In a public forest on the outskirts of Portland, Oregan, Iraq War veteran Will (Ben Foster) lives with his young teenage daughter Tom (Thomasin McKenzie) in a small isolated camp. One day, the two are discovered and are forced to move into a social services home. While Tom enjoys interacting with the local kids, Will, who suffers from PTSD, struggles to integrate with the other people and decides that it is best for the two of them to continue on looking for a more idyllic place to live.Well acted and well shot, Leave No Trace successfully explores the theme of belonging and the importance of family in a clever and nuanced fashion. Both Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie were perfectly cast as Will and Tom, respectively. Each of their scenes felt like we were watching a real father and daughter trying to survive what life was throwing at them and the steps they each took to overcome it. Director Debra Granik uses creative cinematography to emphasise the parallels of the natural forest with the artificial suburban neighbourhood. In a way, these two settings almost become characters of their own. The film leaves an impression on the audience not with heavy dialogue or action scenes, but instead with a non-sensationalistic and respectable journey into the minds of two completely different people and the ways that they see life.I rate it 8/10",Leave No Trace

With a similar quietness and the major character of nature she portrays the lives of two outsiders who live in the woods until their lives is interrupted by a little mistake. 
The film portrays two very interesting characters. Especially the one played by Ben Foster is fascinating in a way because the audience knows it is a character full of secrets and not many are revealed during the curse of the film. Foster gives a fantastic performance and really brought that character to live. Thomasin McKenzie is also very good, playing his daughter who more and more struggles with the life path her father chose for them. It is a great breakthrough performance and I am sure we will see more of McKenzie in the future. Girl got great talent.

64,apryla-58795,One doesn't want to leave...the other can't stay,10,27 February 2019,"Leave no Trace is based on the novel of the same title by Peter Rock. It is directed by Debra Granik (2010's Winter's Bone).The movie centers on Will (Ben Foster) and his young teenage daughter Tom (Thomasin McKenzie) who have been living off the grid for most of Tom's life. They are living illegally in a public park in Oregon. They have no contact with other people except the rare times they go to town to get supplies or Will visits the VA medical facility to get prescription meds which he then turns around and sells to another man living off the grid near them in the same park. Will is ex-military and due to his time in the service no longer feels ""at home in the world"". He can no longer handle living within society and playing by the rules. He teaches Tom how to survive outdoors focusing specifically on how to ""leave no trace"" (hence the title of the movie) so no one can find them and force them to leave the park. They spend their days foraging for food, fortifying their living area and playing chess. They have a very close and loving relationship and they co-exist together very smoothly and easily. It is not explained why Tom's mother is no longer in the picture but from a conversation they have later on it seems as if she died when Tom was very young as Tom no longer remembers her.One day when Tom is out in the woods by herself reading a textbook a runner spots her. She hides but unfortunately isn't fast enough. She thinks she's in the clear but very shortly after park rangers come through searching for them and they are caught. Will is handcuffed and taken away and Tom is left in the care of social worker Jean Bauer (Dana Millican). Will and Tom are kept apart for awhile. They are given tests to gauge how well adjusted they are. Through Will's ""home schooling"" type education throughout Tom's life she scores quite high on the academic tests. Will has a tougher time answering the questions regarding his mental state but does well enough that they decide to allow Will and Tom to be together again.Through the assistance of Mr. Walters (Jeff Kober) a kind businessman who grows and sells what look like Christmas trees they are allowed to live in a home on his property in exchange for help with the trees.Will is not happy with the situation they've been forced into but he knows he has to play along in order to keep Tom with him. They settle into a routine with Will helping with the trees and Tom getting to know some of the neighbors on the farm. Tom likes their new situation but Will is like a caged animal. After staying for awhile he wakes Tom up early one morning and tells her to pack her stuff.Tom doesn't want to leave but has no choice. They get on a bus and then they hitch a ride with a trucker to Washington. When they get there it is really cold and they have no food or shelter. Tom is freezing and can't keep up. Will makes them a temporary shelter for the night. The next morning they find an uninhabited cabin and settle in.Will tells Tom he is going into town and that he'll be back that evening. The day passes and then it's evening and still no sign of Will. Tom knows something is wrong so she sets out in search of Will. She finds him passed out in a ravine from some kind of injury. She is able to flag down some people to help. They take Will back to their place and start to call an ambulance but Tom begs them not to. Dale (Dale Dickey) the owner of the house they brought Will to seems to understand the situation so she calls Blane (David M. Pittman) who was a medic in the Army to help Will. Will has hurt his foot pretty badly so he needs to be on crutches for awhile.Dale owns a RV park area and lets Will and Tom stay in one of the unrented units. Will again struggles with the confinement but Tom settles in easily. She gets to know the other people in the park. She helps Dale take a bag of food to a place in the woods for a friend. Dale tells Tom she never sees him but she knows he's out there as the food is always gone the next time she goes back to leave more food. Tom also learns beekeeping from one of the park residents and starts to feel a sense of peace and belonging within the small park community.One day Will is packing his stuff when Tom comes in and she asks him why. He wants to leave but she wants them to stay. She tells him ""the same thing that's wrong with you isn't wrong with me."" She is trying to tell him that he is making his issues her issues and she doesn't want to live like that anymore. She wants consistency and a permanent home. Will persists and finally Tom realizes she has to pack and go too.After they head out Tom stops and tells Will that she knows he'd stay if he could but she can't go with him. Will is heartbroken but knows that this is where their time together has come to an end. Tom can't leave the sense of home and belonging she now realizes she has come to enjoy and want and Will simply cannot handle living in normal society. Tom heads back to the park and Will heads off into the woods.The last scene shows Tom leaving a bag of food for Will in the woods much like Dale does for her friend. They don't live together anymore but he is still close by.This movie was so good it's impossible to do it justice by leaving a review/opinion. The acting is great. I'm not a fan of Ben Foster but he was very good in this. Thomason McKenzie (Tom) is a wonder to behold. She's like a young colt finding her footing in the acting world and it will be enjoyable watching her career unfold. She's a natural and this was truly her movie.The scenery and the cinematography is really beautiful. You feel as if you are right there in the woods with them. You want to be a part of the small RV park community as the closeness and sense of belonging really come through.Will was selfish in keeping his daughter away from the world and making her live in unideal and unsafe conditions but he has a lot of demons and he can only deal with them by hiding away. He was coping the best way he knew how. It was inevitable that it would come to them separating but such is life. I think his motives were misguided but pure. Tom will be the better for it in the long run as she learned valuable information that they don't teach in school-outdoor survival and how to depend on herself.The last thing I will say is please consider donating to institutions that support our vets. It's terrible how they aren't cared for or supported after they've served our country. They need the most help after they get out of the service but we are losing too many of them to suicide. They are not given the proper tools to cope with reentering society after they've served their time. The Gary Sinise Foundation (Lt.

65,garethcrook,A real immersive treat.,8,26 June 2021,"I'd forgotten why this was on my watch list, but I think it's the director Debra Granik responsible for Winter's Bone that brought me here. There's an outdoorsy feel there, as there is here. Where Winter's Bone is bleak and desaturated from the start. Leave No Trace at least starts with an idyllic feel. Will (Ben Foster) and his daughter Tom (Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie) live off grid in the wooded forests of Oregon. It's not clear what's brought them here, but they seem content, self sufficient, despite the rain. Something isn't right though... they're hiding and when you hide. Well sooner or later... ""We know who you are and what's going on"" the arresting officer says. Tom doesn't remember her mother. Doesn't remember anything but her life with her dad in the woods, but now finds herself answering questions about their lives together to social services. It's a stark contrast and the film plays up to that. There's no background score, the sound like the cinematography is sparse, simply, incidental. Minimal dialogue, it feels natural and therefore almost voyeuristic. Will and Tom going through an upheaval that maybe we needn't be privy to. Rehoused, everyone doing what they're supposed to within the system. That should be it right? Acclimatising can be difficult though. Walls, possessions, church, school. Tom takes it in her stride. Will not so much and he struggles with Tom finding some independence. His reluctance to adapt, sets them on a dangerous path and causes a tiny rift between father and daughter that is only ever going to deepen. It's slow and purposeful. A tale of practicality, stubbornness, alienation, consumerism, all with the backdrop of the harsh Pacific Northwest. Films like this have an odd feel. It's not entertainment in the traditional sense. It's not documentary despite its themes and situations being real. Like Nomadland it sits in someplace in between. As we reach further in though the drama increases as the stakes get higher, the pace still slow, begins to grip as the first score I recall drifts in. You need to be patient though. There are a lot of questions, some are answered, but the viewer is expected to immerse themselves and trust that Granik will deliver as much or as little as needed. Foster is great as the disenfranchised loner focused only on their freedom. McKenzie though steals the film. She's fantastic. For such an understated role, it's amazing how much gentle power she conveys. Just as cautious, but she's the open warmth. The light and the beating heart of a remarkably touching film. It really is quite a journey.",Leave No Trace
66,ronakkotian,Slow exploration of a father-daughter dynamic,7,4 August 2020,A 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. I had to see this film just because of that.Leave No Trace follows a father and his daughter that live in a large park. One day something happens which changes their lives.This isn't a film for everyone. Its pacing is really slow and takes its time to tell its story. I really wish the film was faster but I appreciate the work put in by Debra Granik. Her direction is solid. The camerawork is excellent with some beautiful shots of the park. Her script is great. It lets the audience think for themselves without revealing it through exposition. There is this realistic feeling you get whilst watching Leave No Trace and it's largely due to the slow pacing and dialogues. The dialogues are very simple but some of them evoke a lot of emotion and meaning once you think about them. It is a film about the relationship between a father and daughter but Granik adds a lot more layers to it and her approach towards that is commendable.If there is something you should watch this film for is the two lead performances. Ben Foster is simply marvellous and gives a very nuanced portrayal of a father who's going through a lot. Child performances tend to disappoint me but Thomasin McKenzie really surprised me. She was absolutely astonishing and you really feel the relationship between her and Foster.Leave No Trace isn't something I would revisit but I admire the work done by Debra Granik and the two outstanding performances by Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie really elevate the film.,Leave No Trace

68,davidgee,A boy called Tom,9,12 July 2018,"A plot summary of this movie would put most filmgoers off. A traumatised US veteran and his daughter are living 'off the grid' in a forest in Oregon. Social services catch up with them and house them in a suburban community. The girl begins to enjoy a more 'normal' life but her dad insists on returning to the wilderness until an accident forces them to stay in a trailer park and come to a decision about their future.This slight story is given huge substance by the intense performances of Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie. There's a lot the viewer has to guess at. We can see Dad is deeply disturbed but we're only given brief nightmare glimpses of military chaos in whatever godforsaken war zone he served in. We learn that Mom's favourite colour was yellow but we're not told how or why she left them. Why is the daughter called Tom - surely not because the actress is called Thomasin?McKenzie's Tom is heart-wrenchingly believable; you care deeply about where this girl's life is headed. The role and the story carry strong echoes of Jennifer Lawrence's 'break-through' picture WINTER'S BONE (2010) from the same writer/director team, Anne Rosellini and Debra Granik. Where other films have masses of action and crude dialogue, LEAVE NO TRACE has slow moments and silent faces which convey hope and heartbreak.

70,andrewroy-04316,"A patient but deep dive into this complex father-daughter relationship, filled with subtlety and emotion",9,5 January 2019,"Granik builds on her immersive 2010 film Winter's Bone with another nuanced slice of life movie. In Leave No Trace, we are from the first scenes present in the lush atmosphere of the Oregon forest. What makes this movie tick is the paradoxically unwavering yet fragile bond between Tom and Will. The script is excellent, clearly showing their care for each other in small thank you's and care while also leaving plenty of space for the actors to show their love in small facial cues and body language. Foster is very good, but it was Mackenzie that really impressed me in her ability to convey the love and protection she feels for her father as well as the frustration with his insistence on their isolated lifestyle. The layers written into Will's character were so thought-provoking, and Granik makes those layers more potent by keeping his PTSD and social anxiety implicit and ambiguous. The cinematography is gorgeous to look at, the sound design is excellent, and the ending is surprising and devastating. It's a simple movie, but an extremely effective one.",Leave No Trace
71,CineMuseFilms,an engaging and touching tale that leaves a warm glow,8,10 July 2018,"Framing a story through the outlier's point of view is a self-reflective device that makes us to look at ourselves through the eyes of the marginalised other. It usually adopts a single perspective but Leave No Trace (2018) is as multi-layered as a Russian doll. Homelessness, poverty, single-parenting, post-traumatic stress disorder, and life off-the-grid are just some of the themes woven into this finely balanced film.The ruggedly beautiful opening scenes show a father and daughter appearing to be camping in the wilderness. Silent but for the sound of nature, they forage, taste nature's bounty, and communicate by gesture. The father, Will (Ben Foster), is a war veteran with chronic PTSD and cannot stand the confinement of conventional accommodation. His teenage daughter, androgynously named Tom (Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie), has been raised by Will since infancy and is as adept at chess and reading literature as she is at hunting in the wild. They are close, sleep together for warmth, and the forest is their home. That is until a walker spots them and police are brought in.Immediately applying labels like homeless and potential abusive relationship, the authorities subject them to the kind of interrogation that presumes the worst. When suspicion lifts, Will is praised for how well he has raised Tom but they are not permitted to return to their forest home. Social service accommodation is found, but Will soon flees again and Tom must follow. The cycle is repeated until the rapidly maturing Tom must face either a life running from Will's war torments or claim her independence, put down roots, and let him go.This film works on all levels. The cinematography has a docu-drama feel, with hand-held camera-work that intimately observes the father and daughter bond. This is pitched perfectly because of the understated authenticity of performance by Foster and McKenzie. It must have been tempting to dramatize the veteran's trauma but here it is expressed entirely through Foster's eyes and silent stare. McKenzie consumes her role, emerging from the cocoon of adolescence to a butterfly, vibrant, caring, and grounded in self-belief. The dynamic between them is the scaffold that raises the story beyond expectations.It would be challenging to find another film that could more appropriately carry the 'hybrid genre' label. Strands of adventure story, a coming of age tale, a road trip, and a drama, are all present but none dominate. Nor does the film offer an easy solution to helping people like Tom and Will. This is an engaging and touching tale that leaves a warm glow.",Leave No Trace
72,TheDonaldofDoom,"A subtle, emotive slow-burn",10,14 January 2019,"""Leave No Trace"" is such a wonderful, pure watch because of the way it intertwines several themes in a subtle way, but it's also a highly emotional watch because of the brilliant performances of its two main characters and its light, poetic touch.One of the themes that stuck out to me was the relationship between man and nature. Will teaches his daughter Tom to leave no trace not just to prevent the authorities from finding them, but because he has genuine care for the natural world and a desire to make as little impact on it as possible. This is in stark contrast to the city, where the excellent direction shows its noise and business in a way that isn't overstated. I love the use of sound, where the pristine quiet of the forest can be contrasted with the loud noise of normal busy human life. We also witness the carelessness of the authorities towards nature when they find Will and Tom's home. But this film is nothing if not nuanced. In the end, Tom finds a community that she would fit into. It's a community that has a love of nature but lives within the system, not outside it like Will and Tom did. It's a hopeful note to end on despite the sad ending, as it shows you can live amongst nature without sacrificing community.The subtle development of Will and Tom is where the emotional drama comes from. They are not static characters; they change. At first it seems as if everything is perfect but the sudden change of lifestyle caused by the authorities finding them starts exposing their differences. Tom can adapt to society whereas Will cannot. We see this first in insignificant ways such as his objection to having a mobile phone, but it reaches a climax when they reach what seems like the perfect community. Their separation is beautiful and moving, partly because it never goes down the route of argument. Tom tries to reason with Will a bit, but when she sees his mind is made up she doesn't try harder. She accepts it. There is no shouting, no melodrama. It's perfect.Will's mental illness is present and it's what makes him unable to adapt to fit into a community, but its presence is subtle and his service in the army is mentioned only once. It's deeply sad that there wasn't a place for him in society, but the blame doesn't lie solely with him or with the authorities. It probably doesn't lie with anyone. Everything doesn't need to be made obvious for us to understand the depth of these characters. It's all in the subtext and it's perfect that way. This is a film that doesn't hammer home its themes, and it's all the better for it.",Leave No Trace

I've seen reviews comparing it to CAPTAIN FANTASTIC. While it obviously shares themes with that film, LEAVE NO TRACE is a subtler, quieter work, focussed as much on internal as external struggles. Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie make a completely convincing father and daughter. There is fine support from Dana Millican and Dale Dickey. All craft aspects are in good hands.

Great acting, writing and pacing.Quite a unique movie for the 2020s in fact. I wish it did more to raise awareness in helping war vets with mental health issues, but then again, it does more than any other recent movie.Because good people can do bad things, and in their efforts to protect the people they love, they can make mistakes.

75,President_George_Washington,FROM THE DESK OF GEORGE WASHINGTON,1,9 July 2021,"Good Morrow, countrymen.Do literally anything else with your time...plow a field, eat a carrot, stare at an old tree. Anything.If you hate the military and think the homeless are cuddly rugged survivalists - this is the film for you.An idealized portrait of a homeless war vet suffering PTSD living in the woods along with his teenage daughter. Eventually, big government swoops in and dislodges them from ""tranquility"" and forces them into social programs with the goal of integrating them back into normal society. Problem is, the father doesn't want to live in a house, he wants to wander around in the woods without a plan...and the daughter, she grows to realize the futility of his chosen life.I'm not sure what the story is. The film doesn't address the reality of homelessness. Most of them are addicted to all sort of drugs/alcohol...here, the Vet gets his pills from the VA and sells them. He doesn't do drugs or drink. Instead, he's taught his daughter to read at a level above her grade and learn about the world around her.It's all a fantasy.The percentage of homeless families that resemble what this film portrays is zero. The happy commune that takes them in - raises bees that are so hippy chill they won't sting - strumming folk guitars and singing around a campfire and enjoy a peaceful existence. Again, a complete fantasy. Those places are full of drugs and all sorts of violent types. Not the place for a vulnerable teen girl. Get real!If the film's goal was to shed a light on PTSD - it failed...it doesn't make you go mental and march around in the woods. He was just garden variety insane, to call it PTSD resulting from military service is an insult to actual vets. Some vets do struggle, of course, but this film side-steps a realistic approach to those vets. My take away is it's anti-military.If the goal was to show just how unbelievably dangerous it is to be homeless - it failed. Homeless camps are a nightmare.This film took no position except to paint a fairytale world that the ""forgotten"" class live in. I can accept a simple character study, but even at that failed. The dad as so few lines that you never really learn anything about him...like where is the mom? Why isn't he taking his meds? Why isn't he interested in getting better? His actions and motivations make no sense...it's all just chalked up to ""some people just can't be saved.""I'd like to rate this higher, but the filmmaker hasn't spent time with PTSD military vets, nor has she spent time with the homeless.If you're gonna turn a book into a movie, you have to do more than read the book and think...ooooh, I can make a cool indi picture with this. Nice and moody with a real Pacific northwest vibe. Hippies will love it!Rubbish film.Fare thee well, it's hoecakes and Madeira time.",Leave No Trace
76,jtncsmistad,"""Leave No Trace"" is one of the finest films of the year...",8,17 December 2018,"And nearly nobody is going to see it. I have now. This is the craft at it's absolute best.Director and Co-Screenplay Writer Debra Granik has fashioned a story of great depth and resonance. Not by hammering it home. But rather by allowing genuinely moving moments, both quiet and strident, to breathe and take effect. And ""Leave No Trace"" certainly, and resoundingly, delivers an enduring impact.Ben Foster is brilliant as War on Terror vet Will, an emotionally wounded soul unable to assimilate back into a society dumping more disappointment and devastation upon him than any man should have to bear. Foster never, ever appears to be acting here. His performance is Oscar worthy, though there is considerable doubt whether he'll even be nominated. Shame on The Academy if this be so.Young New Zealand actress Thomasin McKenzie is equally superb in her role as Will's dutiful daughter, Tom. She and her dad don't speak all that much. But that doesn't make their communication any less poignant, nor their unusually tight bond not as steadfast as steel forged in fire.The ending of ""Leave No Trace"" is a tough one to process.

77,The_late_Buddy_Ryan,Brilliant Film + Some Great Pacific Northwest Vistas--Ideal for Urban Self-Isolators!,9,23 May 2020,"Debra Granik's latest isn't as plot-centered or as conventionally dramatic as her breakout hit, ""Winter's Bone,"" but it still has real emotional impact, and the absence of flashbacks and expository dialogue really concentrates the mind. We have no idea, at first, why this tense, tight-lipped man and his teenage daughter are living in the wild (a vast old-growth forest preserve outside Portland, OR, as it turns out) and why they seem terrified of strangers, including an inmate work crew. A short scene set in a VA hospital gives us our first clue; then we see the father, Will, flogging his psych meds in a homeless encampment for grocery money.This film's unusual because virtually all the conflict plays out inside Will's head, and he's not much for sharing. A social worker and a sympathetic farmer find them a place to live and a job for Will bundling Christmas trees. Daughter Tom's willing to ""adapt,"" she says, even attend a 4H club meeting with the farm kid down the road, but Will's not happy living in someone else's house and wants to move their bivouac deeper into the woods.In a way, Granik and co-writer Anne Rosellini's script is as secretive and self-protective as their protagonist. All we know about Tom's mother is that she ""isn't here"" to watch her daughter grow up; when Tom searches through her father's sealed pouch of ""important documents,"" we catch a glimpse of a newspaper headline--""A Unit Stalked by Suicide, Trying to Save Itself."" ""Was your dad in the service?,"" an ex-army medic asks Tom after they meet on the trail. She nods; so much for ""back story""--no grainy quick-cut montage of firefights with the Taliban or Iraqi insurgents.The pace of the film's second half is just about perfect. After an intense trek into the deep woods, Will and Tom come to rest in an encampment of laid-back RV dwellers. Tom's fascination with a hive of well behaved bees signals her longing for stability and a sense of community (or so it seemed to me) but Will's still eager to get back on the trail....The two leads are totally convincing. Ben Foster's spooky intensity seems just right for Will. Thomasin McKenzie's especially good at conveying Tom's fascination, after years of living like a hunted animal (or an Army Ranger), with the perks of the sedentary life, not so much the creature comforts as the comfort of the creatures--the bees and the 4H kids' big floofy rabbits. The rest of the cast doesn't get much screen time, but it's nice to see Dale Dickey, the scary matriarch who roughs up Jennifer Lawrence in ""Winter's Bone,"" in a benign, non-threatening role, and fans of 70s ""freak folk"" stalwart Michael Hurley should be glad to hear from him again.One more thing: After producing such a tight, suspenseful screenplay, Granik and Rosellini have surely earned the right to some occult seahorse imagery-apart from ""seahorse"" being a codeword for PTSD (the Latin word for seahorse is ""hippocampus,"" which is the region of the brain that gets burnt out by stress; see ""Trivia"" above), the little guys are renowned for their intense pair bonding (according to a book Tom's reading when she's spotted by a park ranger) as well as, I'm guessing, for the males' uncommon devotion to their offspring...",Leave No Trace

Until the ending everything is interesting and believable, but I didn't buy the ending. It's not necessarily a bad ending, just expected a bit more or something else. Describing the whole movie as understated would be an understatement, and the ending makes no difference.We haven't had wars in Finland in a good while, so PTSD is not that well known. We (or atleast me) mostly hear or see about it in american movies. The dad in this movie is suffering from what I gather service / war based PTSD, but we are never really let inside his head, we only get hints when helicopter sound stresses him etc. For me the ending didn't seem believable, but I'm not familiar with PTSD. Maybe the fathers earlier actions in the movie don't really justify the decision he makes in the end. Or maybe I missed some (subtle) hint and misunderstood the ending.I liked the fact that this movie doesn't really have baddies in it, that's super rare for a movie these days.Acting in general is super good, although Ben Fosters has less to play with in the end.

86,Bertaut,"Deeply respectful of its subject, but its greatest asset is also its biggest flaw",7,8 July 2018,"In Walden, his 1854 memoir/philosophical treatise, Henry David Thoreau chronicles a period of two years, two months, and two days during which time he lived alone in a small cabin he himself had built in the forest near Walden Pond, Massachusetts, on property owned by his mentor and friend, Ralph Waldo Emerson. Inspired by the tenets of transcendentalism, of especial importance to Thoreau was ""Self-Reliance"", an 1841 essay by Emerson, which argues that an individual must avoid conformity, follow their own ideas and concepts, and trust in their own instincts if they are to attain a deeper understanding of the nature of existence (""Society everywhere is in conspiracy against the manhood of every one of its members. Society is a joint-stock company, in which the members agree, for the better securing of his bread to each shareholder, to surrender the liberty and culture of the eater. The virtue in most request is conformity. Self-reliance is its aversion. It loves not realities and creators, but names and customs. Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist. He who would gather immortal palms must not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must explore if it be goodness. Nothing is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind""). In Walden, Thoreau was putting this concept to the test, isolating himself from civil society, and existing in nature with only the barest means of subsistence (""I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach"").Walden went on to become one of the (many) foundational texts of libertarianism, the core principles of which are the valuation of personal liberty above all else, and the encouragement of scepticism towards authority in general, and the state/government in particular. All of which brings us to Leave no Trace, which could, perhaps, be described as a darker version of Captain Fantastic (2016). Directed by Debra Granik, and written for the screen by Granik and Anne Rosellini, based on Peter Rock's 2010 novel, My Abandonment, the film tells the story of Will (Ben Foster), a veteran suffering from PTSD, who is living off the grid with his daughter Tom (Thomasin McKenzie), making their home in a national park in Portland, Oregon. There, they embody many of the concepts underpinning Emerson's notions of self-reliance; individual authority, nonconformity, solitude, internal self-truth, with Will especially valuing freedom of thought. However, when a jogger sees Tom, park wardens are dispatched to track them down, and social services open an investigation into their situation. Will is aghast, resenting the infringement upon his autonomy, recalling Iain King's statement that ""autonomy should only be infringed if a person is unable to know their own interests on a particular matter"". This certainly isn't the case with Will, and he sees no reason why he and Tom shouldn't be allowed to continue to live in their own way.None of the philosophical theories outlined above are explicitly mentioned anywhere in the film. However, knowledge of them definitely helps one to more easily understand Will. Whether Granik or Rosellini are even aware of these concepts is beside the point, as they serve to give one a more assured theoretical entry point into a not easily penetrated film. For example, does one have to know that Will is at stage six of Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development to understand or enjoy the film? No, of course not. Does it help? Absolutely.On a less theoretical note, the film does a lot that on paper would seem to be wrong; for long stretches of time, there is no real sense of any kind of standard Aristotelian conflict, as we simply observe Will and Tom going about their day. In tandem with this, the film is extremely light on plot, incident, and tangible character development, focusing instead on mood and tone, and calling upon the actors to externalise their emotions through action and expression rather than dialogue. Obviously, this means almost everything hinges on the quality of the performances and the believability of the bond between the characters. Thankfully, both Foster and McKenzie are exceptional - he plays Will as someone who has seen the darker side of humanity and has no time for frivolousness, whereas she plays Tom as someone desperate to have a childhood, but who also wants to make her father proud. In one particularly telling scene, when they must leave on a moment's notice, he tells her to pack only what is essential, and she places a toy horse in her backpack, but only after she has wrapped it up so Will can't see it, an action which tells us a great deal about both characters.The film's pacing is both its greatest asset, and its biggest flaw. To speed things up would have compromised the tone Granik is going for. However, this kind of methodical pacing is likely to alienate a lot of viewers, who will undoubtedly criticise the film as boring, and its focus on Will and Tom to the exclusion of almost everything else as too narrow. When it does branch out (for example, a minor sub-theme is the treatment of veterans upon their return to society), it is only insofar as to show how the two main characters are affected. What's especially interesting about the story, however, is that the narrative seems predicated on the transcendentalist notion of the inherent goodness of people; pretty much everyone Will and Tom encounter is trying to do right by them, even the social workers are genuinely trying to help them. In the end, what the film gives us is a deeply respectful portraiture of a man trying to make the best of it in the only way he knows how. A fine film.",Leave No Trace

'Leave No Trace' is about the relationship between a girl and her father. It's a patient movie and a thorough one. It takes its time unveiling the details of their relationship and their lives. Dad (Ben Foster, gripping) suffers from PTSD from his time in the military. He cannot function in society, so he chooses to live in the forest. His 13-year-old daughter, Tom (Thomasin McKenzie, a revelation), lives with him. Though life in the forest provides its challenges-Tom is growing and is often hungry-the two live happily. As Tom says, they ""didn't need to be rescued,"" but living on public land is illegal. They're brought in and assigned to indoor housing so they can re-acclimate themselves with society. While Tom thrives, her dad struggles. He cannot handle this lifestyle anymore. The strength of their bond is tested, and it keeps them together as they navigate unfamiliar and uncomfortable terrain. Both actors are terrific-serious and subtle. The whole movie is subtle. There isn't much dialogue, but the subtext says a lot. Director Debra Granik operates with a light touch that lets events unfold without forcing anything upon her audience.Her film style simply presents moments and allows viewers to actively participate in them.

Their chemistry is genuine and I could sympathize with their struggle. Also the forest cinematography is simply gorgeous to look at.

91,scb_coldsteel,One of the best films of 2018.,9,11 February 2019,"So I finally rented Leave No Trace from Redbox. For some reason this film was not on my radar for the year. I must say it really was one of the most underrated films of 2018. I highly recommend everyone to go out and watch this subtle, but powerful depiction of the negative effects of PTSD.On the service of the film the plot is relatively simple. A father and daughter struggle to live off the grid from society, constantly hiding from their past. Of course what maked this film special was its stark and at times painful depiction the effects of PTSD and trauma could have not just on a single person, but also all those around them. It's a powerful message that is expertly teased out throughout the course of the film.What made this film feel so special was just how it handled such a complex issue. The movie did not try and sensationalize the topic with traditional Hollywood tropes, but instead illustrated a very human depiction of trauma. It was a stark slow burn presentation of PTSD that really illuminated the collateral damage that could occur to the human psyche. It very much paid respect to those who suffer from trauma without turning the issue into a simple plot device.You really felt for Ben Foster's character as he struggled with his internal emotions by trying to literally run away at every chance he could from a society he no longer could relate to. Of course the film also showed the impact trauma could have of those you love even if you are trying not to hurt them. The story arc dealing with the daughter in particular was incredibly powerful and really pointed out the harm these residual mental scars could have for our family.The film was also very well directed and written. The movie paid quite a bit of respect to such an important issue and crafed a very personal story that still stayed true to the heart of the matter. The film was shot in a subtle and subdued manner that slowly built upon the journey the family was going through and their emotional struggles. You constantly felt for these people as they went along trying to find their place in a world they didn't recognize.Of course the acting in this film was outstanding. A character-driven drama like this lives and breathes with the support of a strong cast. Ben Foster is such a great character actor in every way. He always brings something special to his performances and this film was no exception. He was at the heart and center of this movie and without his strong performance the film would not have been so memorable. Thomasin McKenzie is a new face, but she demonstrated quite a bit of maturity and handling this role. I'm certainly going to keep my eye out on her in the future.I very much enjoyed the personal and human meditation on PTSD the film presented. However those looking for a traditional story arc may be disappointed. There was no beginning, middle, and end or other theatric approaches to storytelling. It was a very minimalistic barebones presentation that those accustomed to traditional Hollywood films may become bored with. It's hard to criticize the film for those points however when it was never trying to tell an epic or action filled story.Leave No Trace was one of the best films of 2018. It absolutely deserved more praise and respect than what it is getting. I know in the independent film circuit it is doing well, but this really was an incredible film that demands to be seen. The story was expertly told and presented in a very emotional manner that really paid respect to the issue without sensationalizing it. Plus Ben Foster is absolutely phenomenal here and maybe at a career-best. Do yourself a favor an go watch this hidden gem. A 9.25 out of 10.",Leave No Trace
92,jakebrann,Nothing explained... Goes Nowhere!,5,2 June 2020,When the movie started out it was pretty good and likable. Even though nothing was ever fully explained it was still relatively easy to follow. By the end of the movie I almost couldn't stand the girl anymore. Just wanted to shake her at times when she was completely incapable opening her mouth and talking to people to let them know what was going on! That got old in a hurry. People try to help her and she just stood there staring at them and gave two word answers.It's a decent movie but if you don't watch it you won't miss much.,Leave No Trace
93,ilovesaturdays,Definitely leaves a trace!,9,15 July 2020,"This is the story of a war veteran suffering from PTSD and his 13 year old daughter. Due to his PTSD, the father finds it extremely hard to function in a normal society where there are many rules to follow. The father-daughter duo live an almost survivalist life in a forest reserve in Portland with little or no interaction from outside except occasional visits to the city for some basic supplies. When the authorities are informed of their living arrangement, the duo are informed that it is illegal to live in the forest reserve. Social workers try to rehabilitate them with the help of an accommodation and a job for the father. But the real question is: Will these people who are so well-adapted to a life in the wilderness be willing to adapt to a structured life?The cinematography is exceptionally beautiful with the lush greenery of the forest making the viewing a wonderful experience. I could really see why someone would be unwilling to leave this little bit of heaven. The father-daughter dynamic is simple, minimalist and surreal, just like the rest of the film. These two people are so in sync with each other mentally that they don't need a lot of words or big gestures of love or anger to convey their emotions. There are no showdowns or big arguments and they settle their differences with amazing insight and maturity. Makes you wish that every family were so much in tune with each other!My only gripe is that just about everyone they meet is a very nice person. While that makes it easy to perceive the duo's living preferences as their personal choice, it also makes the movie seem rather unrealistic. That said, if some day, the society were to consist of only nice and well-meaning people, you won't hear me complaining!",Leave No Trace

96,PotassiumMan,Bare-bones sketch of father-daughter bond in the wild,8,6 August 2018,"Low-key, minimalist and unpretentious, this film does not angle for formulaic storytelling. What it does instead is portray a former U.S. military service member's close relationship with his teenage daughter and his choice to raise her away from modern society. A true survivalist, the father teaches her how to get by on her own in the wilderness in the Pacific Northwest. They live together in a national park in Oregon when their lives are upended upon being discovered by law enforcement.Ben Foster is quietly powerful as the father and newcomer Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie is equally amazing and sympathetic as his teenage daughter. The two play off each other flawlessly and the father-daughter relationship that soon starts to fray is wonderfully brought to life. The narrative of this film can sometimes seem very slight but as with other films, that doesn't always take away from a film's achievement. It certainly doesn't here. In some respects, the slow pacing makes the turns of events all the more magnified.With a conclusion that makes me more emotional the more I think about it, this film is worthy of respect and recognition. It conveys the delicate balance of one's relationship with a parent as one comes of age. It does not pretend to have any clear answers. But nor does it try to judge the two people whose lives are depicted here. A deeply affecting tale like this doesn't come around that often. Strongly recommended.",Leave No Trace
97,bastille-852-731547,Thoughtful Father-Daughter Drama,7,19 July 2018,"This new indie drama centers on a father with post-traumatic stress disorder and his teenage daughter who live off the grid in Oregon. This film has received nearly unanimous praise from critics, and having seen it I can say that it is a worthwhile cinematic venture. The film's cinematography of the Oregon wilderness is nothing short of superb, drawing predominately from neoclassical-inspired wide shots that help the viewer maintain a sense of scope and scale surrounding the natural world in which the film takes place in. The film's two main performances are generally strong from beginning to end, as both characters are placed in a variety of physically and emotionally demanding quagmires. In many ways, the film's exceptionally simple music and writing choices enhance the film because it allows the viewer to focus his or her undivided attention on the scenery and characters.While the film is well-directed, there certainly could have been more surface to dig into regarding character development, particularly for the young girl. Also, the amount of implicit and explicit emotional power the viewer develops and takes in from watching these two characters could have been increased while still feeling genuine, although I suppose the intentional depiction of overt stoicism among the father character depletes that critique to a certain extent. The film's pacing is very slow, but this is not a complaint against the film--once again, the slow pace allows (patient) viewers to maintain focus from beginning to end. Overall, this is a well-shot drama that will satisfy sophisticated audiences looking for an alternative to the big blockbusters of this summer. 7/10",Leave No Trace

This is a quiet film, slow-paced, with lots of silences and shots that linger, which cumulatively builds to an intensity that overwhelms. The two leads are outstanding.

This movie starts off great but Midway through towards the end it turns very selfish. I can understand a father wanting to protect his daughter and live a certain way they are used to living. But here they were discovered, offered all the help in the world,which is rare for this screwed up system. The father and daughter are given, clothing, food, shelter and they still let him keep his daughter and the father still chose to run out to the Wilderness and keep them living like nomads. Even almost getting himself killed and placing his daughter in danger. For this reason alone the movie went from interesting to infuriating. He should have been arrested and locked up for abuse!

The exposition-less script is refreshing, allowing the audience to actually think for themselves about the lives of the characters and how they got to where they are at the beginning of the film. All of the dialogue feels entirely natural (a testament to both the screenwriters and the actors) and this, combined with the subtle, yet nuanced direction, gives the film an almost documentary type feel, which fully compels the viewers to engage with the lives and central relationship of the protagonists. 7/10.",Leave No Trace
104,themovieparadise,Great Performances!,8,2 August 2018,"It seems like every year we get at least one movie about a family who lives out in the woods. In 2016 we got Captain Fantastic, in 2017 we got The Glass Castle, and now, in 2018, we get Leave No Trace. I always find these movies interesting, because they usually dive into the psychology and the philosophy behind living in the woods isolated from society. And with that usually comes some compelling storytelling and excellent performances. With Leave No Trace, Army veteran Will (Ben Foster) and his daughter Tom (Thomasin McKenzie) live out in the woods until they are forced to assimilate into society, which causes a divide between the two. I didn't really know anything about this movie going in but, as part of my new initiative to see a new film in theaters every Saturday morning, I went to go see it, and I quite liked it. While I'd say I probably like Captain Fantastic and The Glass Castle more, Leave No Trace is a great drama featuring two strong performances from two talented actors. This film isn't going to win any Oscars or make any big splashes in pop culture, but for what it is as a film, Leave No Trace is certainly worth the watch...

105,PaxtonMalloy,"Outstanding, not for everyone",8,16 September 2018,This is one of those rare diamonds that somehow got no mainstream attention. Leave no trace is a heartbreaking drama of a father daughter relationship with a father suffering from PTSD. This movie is so great in just showing you what goes on without ever really telling you. That is top notch screenwriting. Every information you get is conveyed by what you see rather than on the nose dialog. Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie deliver Oscar worthy performance. Even more so by playing it so small and so subtle. Foster is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. There interplay and their relationships hooks you and carries the movie.This movie is not for everyone. It is has a very mnimalistic style. There is not much dialog in this movie and when there is it is very calm and short. But if you have a little patience for that sort of film you will get an outstanding movie experience.,Leave No Trace
106,cappiethadog,Here,8,22 February 2020,"The wilderness is their home. But the father and his daughter are not homeless. They're not lost. The girl knows what a seahorse is. Her teeth is her teeth. A dog tooth belongs to a dog.The unconditional love that a child feels for his parents allows the elder to normalize his/her reality, no matter how unconventional, ideologically narcissistic, or dangerous. Three adult children, a man and two women have no names; the oldest child, their unseen brother, lives on the other side of a hedge; he's nameless, too, and doesn't exist, except in their own heads because the father says he exists. ""Dogtooth"", directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, is about a tyrannical father(Christos Stergioglou) who treats his children like lab animals; animals born in captivity and none the wiser about the social norms of the world beyond their lavish compound. At the dinner table, when the younger daughter(Mary Tsoni) asks: ""Mama, can you pass me the phone,"" the mother(Michelle Valley) hands her a salt-shaker. A cat is their mortal enemy. Their grandfather is a vinyl record. The father translates Frank Sinatra's ""Fly Me to the Moon"". Grandfather says hello. The father turned his children's world into a wilderness. They're lost. The father treats his children like dogs. He hires a woman(Anna Kalaitzidou), the security guard from his workplace, in essence, to breed her with his son(Chritos Passalis). This woman, however, isn't housebroken; her disobedience results in extra-curricular activities that allows for the elder daughter(Angeliki Papoulia) to gain possession of contraband, two videos, most likely, ""Rocky"" and ""Flashdance"". At their parents' anniversary party, the elder daughter declares her independence by replicating a montage of Jennifer Beals' best dance moves. ""Dogtooth"" is, more or less, a coming-of-age film. She names herself Bruce; she becomes a woman with an identity. Bruce stands before the bathroom mirror, hammer in hand. Dad taught his children about the dogtooth; lose the dogtooth and you're free to go, but not without a car; the car will protect you from harm outside the compound. Bruce leaves home with a mouthful of blood. Unfortunately, she learned her lessons well.It's like a never-ending camping trip. Tom(Thomasin McKenzie) lives in the woods with her survivalist father(Ben Foster), an Iraq War veteran suffering from PTSD, who lost his way back to civilization, daughter in-tow. ""Leave No Trace"", directed by Debra Granik, argues for and argues against the father's choice to reject the trappings of capitalism as demagoguery and child abuse. While other tweens spend their days and nights online, Tom, who has no friends or even a dog, feathers wood for the fire that heats the water for their hard-boiled eggs. She lines her small vegetable garden with recycled eggshells to prevent an overflow of rainwater. They're vegetarians by default; a gunshot blast can be traced back to their trespassed home, a public park, so Tom collects wild mushrooms, the kind that can't kill you. She's had a lot of practice. But is Tom happy, in the jungle, so to speak, fighting alongside her father in the morass of his innermore war, when she could be with friends at a mall, checking out cute guys? Tom spends every waking moment with her dad. Grounded for life, a total drag, her daughter's contemporaries would observe wryly. Violent mood swings inflict some men diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Is this girl in danger? Whirring helicopter blades haunt Will at night. He carries a knife. They share a tent, for warmth. Nightmares can carry over into waking moments and with a start, realize belatedly about the transferrence of violence against his mortal enemy to precious daughter. The audience waits for the veteran to snap. That moment arrives, we think, when Will can't start a fire started the hard way; with flint and steel. The wood is too damp, Tom insists, and heads toward the propane tank, ignoring her father who made explicit that they're low on gas. In another film, perhaps, the girl would get slapped around for disobedience. ""Leave No Trace"", to its credit, takes the stigma out of mental illness. Tom cooks the wild mushrooms on a grill without any further protestations. The audience relaxes. We realize that this damaged man with an unconventional approach to child-rearing will never lay a finger on his daughter. That is better than a lot of fathers.Tom acts and sounds like a typical thirteen-year-old girl. She's not Nell, a wild child. She's remarkably well-adjusted for someone who is cut off from the outside world, like the Swedish adult children in ""Dogtooth"", victims of domestic captivity. Regular excursions are made to the supermarket for food and supplies paid with money from the prescription drugs Will sells on the black market from the VA hospital. They're not fugitives on the run from the law. In broad daylight, they walk alongside moving cars on marked streets and four-lane highways. Walking off the beaten path is a choice, albeit a choice made by the adult, who outright rejects institutionalized state apparatuses such as school, church, and capitalism. Like father, like daughter, comprising of a happy family unit has it's limits; there are always limits to love. A crossed threshold can be foreshadowed when Tom discovers a pendant necklace some hiker lost. The girl, despite her anti-materialism upbringing, covets the piece of jewelry. If the necklace is still there when they return, the father decides, Tom can keep it. The daughter may be a survivalist, but she's a latent capitalist, too. Like a capitalist, she cheats, kicking the piece of jewelry under some leaves and sticks. The father, too, in ""Dogtooth"", raised his children to desire nothing; they're incidental socialists(the only ideology he practices is despotism) and yet, despite having no exposure to consumerism, everybody wants the miniature airplane, because in this stunted and topsy-turvy world, ownership of this cheap toy is the only way, as it turns out, the older sister, can get ahead in life. For the first time, she differentiates needs from wants; she needs antihistamines, iodine, bandages, and black eyeliner. She wants an airplane. It gives her joy. As aforementioned, unlike her Swedish counterparts, Tom knows how the real world works, albeit as a tourist. The necklace changes Tom. Material items give her joy, too. Does she want to live there, full-time? A man spots her reading a book, an encyclopedia volume, S-T, and although she goes through the motion of hiding, the girl should have taken greater precautions, having witnessed lumberjacks clearing an area the day before. After their arrest, social services places the father and daughter at a Christmas tree farm that provides food and lodging. For Will, it's the ultimate irony, the commodification of Douglas Firs. He can't take it, being a cog in the machine, Against his daughter's wishes, they leave, moving farther up north where it's wetter and colder. It was the closest Tom ever got to celebrating a holiday. At their next stop, Tom will get her chance. She uses their money to rent the cabin at some rural outpost. The father leaves without Tom. She wants to be traceable.Bruce is a boy's name. The elder daughter doesn't know this. She picked it out from the Hollywood film credits. Bruce could be an actor, or a camera operator, or a hair stylist, or a grip. She doesn't know that Alex is a character that Jennifer Beals plays in a big city across the ocean called Pittsburgh. The elder daughter wants it all. She saw it on television. Leave the compound and those legwarmers could be hers, and be like the woman in the video. But she's her father's daughter. The car, always use the car, outside of the family compound. The elder daughter escapes and leaves no trace. But she's not the driver, the father is; she hid herself in the trunk. The next day, the father parks his car at work. The trunk never opens. She died. But at least she died with a feeling, and ""what a feeling"" it was, albeit brief, to be free from her father's control.Tom will meet a boy.
Tom will get married.

115,c-kelsall,Unpretentiously powerful drama,8,8 June 2020,"Leave No Trace is based on a book. It tells the modern tale of an ex-military man and his teenage daughter living initially in a public forest park in Portland, Oregon. It quickly becomes apparent that the father is probably suffering from PTSD, and that he and his daughter have been living off the land in a makeshift camp for years. Suddenly, their life is turned upside down when the authorities become aware that the pair are illegally living in a public park, and they are forcibly removed to sheltered accommodation.
The film has a mostly straightforward narrative, simply told, so the power of the drama is conveyed by the acting performances of the two main leads - Ben Foster as Will, and Tomasin Mackenzie as his daughter, Tom. Both are excellent. The PTSD aspect of the story is played down to little more than inferences from dialogue, and the pain and bewilderment of trying to cope with 'normal' life evident in every aspect of Will's behaviour. Despite his personal misery, Will has a strong relationship with his daughter, a bond of mutual love and respect.
Apparently, there are some areas of the story where the film deviates from the book; not having read the source material, I am not able to expand on that, but in any case it was reported that the author liked the finished film.
This is not the sort of film I spend my days watching, as a rule, but when a drama is as thoughtful, heartfelt and well-crafted as this, it deserves my attention, and that of everyone else as well, in my opinion.",Leave No Trace

For people who wrote nothing happened here, that it's a blank screen for which there are no spoilers -with you folks I can whole heartedly disagree.

From the moment this beautifully-filmed and less acted than bestowed as a gift I didn't know I deserved, I was transfixed to the tv screen, nearest to hypnotized I think I've ever been and by simplicity not blankness. Yes learning to survive without the things engrained in my psyche that must be ... isn't what I saw this father and daughter do. Conversely the challenge in that began with a bed to sleep above ground level and a roof to block the sky. And by the time the story neared its end, survival wasn't of sole relevance. While what's outside of ourselves is constantly in flux, when what's inside can be still but not stagnent, calm from adapting not compromised from tolerance or wrong or right, neither bad nor good nor needing to be one or the other ourselves or for anyone else, then living is where we stand at this moment.

120,rhefner2002,One of the best films of 2018,9,4 November 2019,"How nice to see an intelligent, quiet movie about real, decent people. ""Leave no Trace"" tells the story of a father (Ben Foster) and his teenage daughter (Thomasin McKenzie) who have been living off the grid in an Oregon forest park, and getting by pretty well--foraging for mushrooms, cooking over a fire, drinking rain water, playing chess, sleeping in a tent. Occasionally, they hike to the nearest road and take a bus to nearby Portland for supplies, and so the father can get his anti-depressants and benzodiazepines at the VA clinic, which he doesn't take. He sells them to homeless vets living elsewhere in the park.
Unfortunately, it's illegal to squat in a pubic park, and they get discovered. Well-meaning officials give them medical checkups and mental health tests and set them up with a place to live where the dad can work cutting down Christmas trees and the daughter can attend school. Oregon is well known for its ""socialistic"" programs to help the indigent, even though when the girl is asked by her counselor about being homeless, the girl doesn't know what the word means. As far as she's concerned, she had a home, and her dad took good care of her.The ensuing acts are about the girl adjusting to ""normal"" society, while her dad cannot. He's a Vietnam vet with PTSD, and for reasons unknown, he cannot tolerate any kind of communal existence where he has to interact with other people.The film does not preach. It also doesn't hurry. It runs at the pace of daily life. It's not a thriller, and it's not sensational, at least not in the Hollywood sense. But it is nevertheless brilliant. The performances by Foster and McKenzie are so good, we care about them in the first five minutes, and we follow them through their trials and tribulations with hope that all will turn out well.

127,soundoflight,"A window into the ""other"" America",6,8 October 2018,"""Leave No Trace,"" much like the director's previous work ""Winter's Bone,"" offers a glimpse at the lives of forgotten Americans living in remote corners of the country. It's refreshing in and of itself to see a film based somewhere a bit different, and looking at people's lives we may have otherwise overlooked. And to that end, ""Leave No Trace"" does a wonderful job of capturing the landscape and spirit of Oregon and the Pacific Northwest. And the premise of a man and his daughter surviving in the woods on their own is fascinating. My main issue with ""Leave No Trace"" is that people have been making ""indie"" films almost identical to this for years. It's almost formulaic at this point: take a slice of life out of some downtrodden characters, follow them around for a while, and end on some poignant moment that is supposed to make the viewer think. Case in point: ten years ago there was a film called ""Wendy and Lucy"" where a woman and her dog down on tough times roam around Oregon that followed the exact same formula. And I can think of others, seen at various film festivals over the years. These are not usually bad films, but there is something a bit sophomoric about them. You are probably either the type that enjoys this style or doesn't. While there are a few subtleties of this film that I can appreciate, in the end there is nothing much new here, which, for me, makes the film entirely forgettable.",Leave No Trace

It was like everyone including the authorities were on some kind of mind slowing drug. They were living out in the woods not really doing anything or saying anything - like bumps on a log, then they get chased down and taken in and then set up in a house. The dad didn't like that so he took them back out into the woods and he fell and ended up in a commune but he didn't like that and decided to leave his daughter and disappeared into the woods and that was the end. That's the entire movie. Avoid this slow stinker at all costs.",Leave No Trace
129,rdhoran,Good film but easily could have been better.,7,6 October 2020,"I enjoyed this film but its flat and not credible in many areas.
The director and writers portrayed pretty well the father's PTSD. But I don't have PTSD and I don't know PTSD. My problem is that PTSD came off as a demon that strips a person of any understanding of the needs of other people. In this case, that the young 14 year old daughter ought tag along and live under a tarp, probably forever, in the wilderness, with Dad?It was frustrating that we, the audience, are not told when the father's Iraq tour(s) occured, and when the wife left/died, so we have no idea how long this minimalist 'living in the Oregon woods' has been going on. We see a few propane tanks and concern about using it, because its running low. We see a woefully inadequate tarp, very poorly strung btw, as their daylight rain shelter. Father is bent on striking every fire with steel on flint into dried moss. Everything's going semi-OK at best. I have no idea how they get adequate protein. I guess from town. They find a lot of mushrooms, so vitamin E is not an issue.Daughter is about the best you could ask for. Bright, understanding, loving, resourceful, and hard working. But, when you spend your whole day hunting and gathering you might not have time for the school lessons, we are later told, that her father gave her to be ""ahead of where she needs to be"" by a school administrator. So, Dad taught her so well as to where she's above average in her class, by candlelight, after exhausting days of survival? Well, good for them, I suppose its possible.Then they occasionally go into town for provisions. How is that happening? Is the father getting VA benefits? Not explained at all. Father supposedly understands survival. But, does he get his daughter a decent pair of boots? No. The first time she steps in standing water, she is left with wet freezing feet. Plastic shopping bags over her socks is Dad's solution!Anyway, they eventually get caught illegally squatting, are brought into society's bureaucratic but not unkind embrace, and Dad can only take it for so long. So he bolts with daughter in tow.They cross the state line, and break into a remote locked cabin to keep from freezing to death. You can see the daughter appreciates things like walls and heat. Dad can't stay still and falls down a ravine. Resourceful daughter finds him unconscious with basically a broken leg, and saves his life.She gets him to a camp full of really wonderful people. They put him on the mend in a remote camp village full of very kind and and generous, yet fringy folk, that basically leave him alone and give him as much privacy as you could ask for, and that still doesn't satisfy him. As soon as he can put weight on his leg he packing to go back into the forest, and fully expects the daughter to join him, once again, in his semi-miserable lifestyle.She's has had enough. She's learned to keep bees, be a part of society, once again enjoy the company of others. So, she hugs him and sets him on his way, alone.I guess the message is you can't always treat PTSD. I hope that's not true.",Leave No Trace

131,Argyle302,Leave Traces Behind,6,20 February 2021,"I'm not really sure how to rate this movie, or how to review it. Yes, it was entertaining from a dramatic standpoint, but it seems it's a Hollywood movie trying to glorify homelessness. I'm sure there are a few people out there who actually choose to live off the grid and in the woods, but I'm sure those people are a rarity. Homelessness is not a joke, and it should not be dolled up in anyway. The parenting of the dad here is unexcuseable. He is only thinking about himself, and not thinking about his daughters present or future. I understand that he was traumatized by some war he was in, and had to rely on pain killers, but at some point he's got to understand his daughter cannot go on living the rest of her life in the woods like he wants to.I'm glad in the end, she finally made a choice for herself to live where she wanted. The title of this movie is kind of misleading. It seems like everywhere they went they left traces. I would still recommend people see this movie at least once, the young female lead Thomason does a really good believable acting job here. But Hollywood, and people from the West Coast and from the upper west coast, need to start portraying democrat run cities in a more realistic way. Homelessness is not all unicorns and rainbows. There is a dark and disturbing reality to 99% of it. Liberal cities tend to encourage people to live on the streets, and they enable them by giving them alcohol, drugs, needles, etc, to keep them dependent on their local governments. It's truly very sad and depressing.",Leave No Trace
132,graupepillard,Coming Of Age Story set in the Pacific Northwest,9,17 July 2018,"LEAVE NO TRACE, a film co-written and directed by Debra Granik opens with an aerial shot of dense green foliage, a beautifully constructed spider web catching the sun's silken rays of light, and hanging wet moss dripping water as the camera caresses nature's exquisiteness in the Pacific Northwest landscape - a few miles outside of an alternate world - Portland Oregon. And then we glimpse a man and young girl almost camouflaged among the lush fronds - invisible as they wish to be. A father named Will (Ben Foster) and his teenage daughter, Tom (Thomasin McKenzie) are ""survivalists"" who have tamed a small area of this wild beauty into a home. Their relationship with ""nature"" is respectful; they are both comfortable with living outdoors - cooking, tending to a fire, and getting clear water from the canopy of foliage that envelops them. The relationship with one another is both tender and loving but not equal. Tom, is clearly a teenage girl who is deferential and appreciative of the father who raised her but longing to know more about her mother who died when she was very young. We soon glean that Will is a veteran with PTSD symptoms whose dreams often jolt him awake shaken, gasping shallow breaths against the vast ceiling of stars in the deep black umbrella of space.The beginning of LEAVE NO TRACE depicts how Will and Tom live day-to-day gathering food, playing chess, caring for a garden - all done with a delicate affection that one cannot help but envy, both tending to what is needed to live a life ""off the grid"" - untouched by contemporary life's amenities. Suddenly everything changes when Tom is spotted by a Ranger and police with dogs arrive, violating their intimate island in the midst of the vast protective forest. The outside world has finally permeated their lives, including the assignment of a social worker who gets them situated in pre-fab housing complete with a television, a stove, electricity, and warm shelter. The film is replete with people touching Will and Tom's lives who are very kind, concerned individuals, but are unable to comprehend living a ""homeless"" existence under the light of the moon; an existence which demands nothing from civic institutions, where self-reliance and the ability to live isolated from others is a form of freedom - no matter the cost.Thomasin McKenzie portraying the daughter is a lovely young actor with her pale face and sharply curious dark eyes who adores and understands her father's psychological frailties, however once she comes into contact with the world around her she, unlike her father, embraces all living creatures with an innocence and compassion that is exquisite to observe. Ben Foster gives a moving performance as Will whose wounded, shaken psyche, torn apart by the brutality of war, softens immeasurably whenever he is with his daughter, who he has raised to be self-reliant, strong and gentle - a captivating mixture. As for the rest of society, Will's close-set suspicious eyes reveal the inner turmoil of an untamed colt, jittery and ready to bolt at any unwanted intrusion.All the characters that Will and Tom meet on their journeys, exhibit a sensitivity that belies outward appearances. Director Debra Granik is almost idyllic in her view of community and humanity's goodness all nestled under the light and ambiance of the majestic Pacific Northwest. LEAVE NO TRACE is an honest, unpredictable, quiet film - a coming of age story that touched me to the point of stifling audible sobs while viewing the vulnerable delicacy of human fragility.",Leave No Trace
133,fashinrashin,Best film of 2018,9,28 September 2018,"I lived in Portland for 14 years in the 90s and aughts, and I ran the Forrest Park trails all the time. The entire length is nearly a marathon, 22 miles as I recall. Its the largest city park in the USA.
So seeing that wonderful park brought back some great memories, though it is not nostalgia that is influencing my review. This is a beautiful film, amazing camerawork, brilliant performances. The two leads will have awards aplenty come the season. I have always thought Foster was the real deal, and he proves it here again with a very studied under stated portrayal of a man that has been deeply messed with.
I commiserate with him. There are many who have felt like him, that just ""disappearing"" might be the answer. Though most of us do not act on that thought.

The film follows no path, it has no story arc, and no real drama. Still, it's was very thrilling (at least for me). And that was because i really cared about the girl and her dad.
The movie is full of real americans; good people without any cliches and the usual movie crap. It's a warm story, with fantastic actors. Maybe more of a journey than a movie experience. You just spend some time with the kid and her dad, and in a unique way you feel them, and you fell for them, and are worried about what would happen to them.This gives me hope for the movie makers. We need movies like this with real people, slow tempo, and photography that are so good, that you don't even think about it. A wonderful counter weight to all the crap that Hollywood turns out nowadays. Take your time, relax, and just experience it. That's my advice.",Leave No Trace
135,DJKwa,Leave No Trace leaves a mark,8,27 July 2018,"//Revelation Film Festival Review//If you've ever gone camping you'll know the feeling of tranquillity and stillness that comes with sitting nestled amongst the trees away from the noise. For war veteran Will (Ben Forster), who suffers from PTSD, leaving the noise behind is a necessity not a respite. Living with his daughter, Tom (Thomasin McKenzie), in an urban park in Portland, Oregon, their lives are uprooted when social services mandate their return to society.The most surprising thing about Leave No Trace is how it reveals itself to be an unlikely coming of age story. While Will believes living off the grid is in the best interest of his daughter, the change in circumstances complicates Tom's feelings. Her transformation from being her father's daughter to someone able to make her own decisions leads to some heart-wrenching scenes where she stands up to Will as an equal.

And how this effort by their surrounding is not necessarily successful. This movie also captures the tyranny of the nanny state. This tyranny that is not possible to articulate. But that we all feel. And how it might be a noble instinct to try to run away from what our society have become. But that it is impossible.

Living between scenes of living off the land and day-to-day life there isn't much push forward in the plot.
 Where the movie hits the mark is in acting, with the main actors Thomasin McKenzie and Ben Foster driving almost everything, this film relies solely on their shoulders to not fall apart.

But then isolating your only child from the world doesn't seem like a good idea, depriving her from any real human interaction seems lonely and awful.What is going to happen once her dad dies?

151,rdolan9007,A poignant and beautifully told story of a father and daughter try to escape the modern world by living out in the woods.,9,5 June 2020,"Be left in no doubt Leave No Trace is a very fine film. This came as a relief because I really wanted this to be a good film. I really liked the idea of story's premise; that of a father and nearly teenage daughter living in the wilds of a forest park (near Portland), and having to fend for themselves. The pair as a result live-in what can barely be called a den. They forage for food, have to collect water via various irregular methods, and are in effect trying to keep out the existence of the modern world. Ben Foster plays the ex-veteran father, suffering from the effects of war on his mental health, and Thomasin McKenzie plays his daughter who at first enjoys and accepts this state of affairs.Their world begins to crumble when they are found by the authorities, and are offered housing on a Christmas tree farm which Ben Foster also works on. Here the girl begins to make friends, one of whom keeps rabbits and they are the cutest rabbits to be seen outside the curse of the Were-rabbit. The father though finds it impossible to reconcile himself with feeling trapped in the world of conventional domesticity. He takes the reluctant but compliant daughter with him until the moment which will eventually causes them to break apart.They hitch hike via a truck to another forest, and find a deserted locked cabin. This might seem to be the ideal for them, although you find yourself thinking that the owners of the cabin will eventually find them. The story could have used that as a twist, but instead the father has to go out to get food or money, and ends up in a serious accident. The daughter eventually finds help, and as a result she and the father end up in an RV park, were the owner lets her father and herself stay until he recuperates.Here the crisis that has been developing between father and daughter in the film is quietly but brutally exposed as the girl loves the people and the community of the RV park, and yet her father still cannot comes to terms with even this benign and peaceful world. Their final parting is an un-histrionic but devastating conclusion to the film.The performances throughout this film are exceptional. The father-daughter relationship is thoroughly natural and convincing as a result. The whole film hangs on this relationship and it works so well, that by the end of the film, you may feel like you have been punched out. These people do seem recognisably real, and that ending is not the one you want, but it is the right one in terms of the story. Throughout the film you do get glimpses of hope that maybe somehow things will be all right for them. You want things to be all right for them, but the damage done to the father is so deep that the ending, while it kills you, has a powerful remorseless logic to it.The other key performances include that of Jean (Dana Millican) the social worker assigned to their case. She plays it with the exactly right amount of professionalism and sympathy for their plight. It is a shame that the film's story in away doesn't allow her more time on screen. Yet it makes abandoning the place she finds for them even more painful. This might seem like a hard slog of a watch, but it really isn't. I think Leave No Trace is filmed with such sensitivity that you are simply drawn in. You get inside the predicament of the protagonists, and are able to understand their decisions, even if you don't always agree with them.Dale Dickey as the RV park owner also gives a fine warm sympathetic performance. She helps out the girl and the father in a way that feels unforced, and you think they both might finally find peace in the park. It is the girl who does, but the father can't and he literally disappears in to a forest by the films end; someone who has become truly 'lost' wandering without hope, trying desperately to find peace in the natural world.The cinematography captures the woodland scenes throughout the film extraordinarily well; the dense foliage, still rich and vivid under grey wet skies at the beginning and then the softer sunlit but still dense forest surrounding the trailer park. I was reminded at times of Malick's direction in the film Badlands. It's like the scenery defines almost the mood of the people with in the film. There are hints of Kes as well in the film with the daughter's and her friends handling of the rabbits.The film makes its points carefully. The father having to work in the Christmas tree packing farm; were he has to shape the trees to fit consumer demand. This setting is so cruelly against his idea of what nature should be to him. There is also the sight of bulldozers, knocking down a veterans illegal shack/tented village in the park, while one of the vets is instinctively shouting, for the authorities to stop destroying his 'home' but then realises even as he shouts it is futile. The father and daughters discovery made the discovery of their village inevitable as well. Thus is the fate of soldiers who fought for their country, trying to find peace on 'public' land; their plight mostly ignored, and not given or sometimes unwilling to get the mental health treatment they need.This is a film with a heart, yet not over doing the sentiment, nor descending into melodrama; just telling a deceptively simple but important story. You care about these peoples' fates. It doesn't really offer any substantive answers, and that in the end makes it an honest film with the integrity to match.",Leave No Trace

163,hughrcarson,A refreshingly understated coming-of-age tale,8,12 September 2018,"A father and daughter enjoy a grass roots subsistence existence, living off the land in some Oregon woodland. This land, however, is part of a huge public park, and the setting up of a home in such a location is expressly forbidden by law.Regardless, they mean no bother or harm, and refuse to impose their chosen lifestyle upon anyone else. Not only is their camp thoroughly well camouflaged, but the father is at pains to ensure that by way of frequent 'drills', the pair are able to scamper off at a moment's notice, into the undergrowth, out of sight of the prying eyes of park rangers and the like.Such an existence has worked well for many years, but a chance sighting of the girl one day - by a passing member of the public - swiftly leads to the pair being evicted from their woodland dwellings, and forced to live back in society once again.For the young girl and her father who know little else but the outdoor life, such a transition is always going to prove to be problematic.Debra Granik's film skilfully builds an intricate picture of the unusual bond between PTSD suffering ex-military man, Will (Ben Foster - he of Hell or High Water fame), and his mature-beyond-her-years teenage daughter, Tom (a superbly impressive performance from Thomasin McKenzie), shining the light on their increasingly strained relationship, as Will's inability to cope with the 'real world' begins to seriously conflict with his daughter's ever growing need to discover herself and integrate more into 'normal' society.Leave No Trace is a highly impressive, refreshingly understated coming-of-age tale, told with neither fuss nor melodramatics, and in whose characters one can truly believe and emotionally invest. A story of courage in adversity, of emotional family bonds, and of learning to let go of the ones we love.Simple, moving and thoroughly well realised.This and hundreds of other films are reviewed on my WaywardWolfBlog",Leave No Trace

172,jsteiger,"Brilliant, Thought-Provoking, Unforgettable",10,17 January 2019,"With the addition of Leave No Trace to her resume (that already includes the remarkable ""Winter's Bone,"" Debra Granik *absolutely must* be recognized as one of the great directors of this era. She's amazing. She's proven once again she can take a simple story and creates cinema that has you totally immersed from its opening seconds. She seldom comes even remotely close to striking a false note. In this story, a PTSD-stricken vet Will, played with just the right notes of intensity and inner panic by Ben Foster, lives with his teenage daughter Tom in a carefully hidden campsite in a public park. They have superb survival skills and live a sparse, highly disciplined life. Often they think and move as one, their bond is so strong. But Tom, played brilliantly by Thomasin McKenzie, has an independent streak and is starting to feel the inner stirrings of a longing for something more than the tight confines of her existence. Will, on the other hand, can't handle the stresses of society, sees the current setup as freedom, and want things to stay as they are. Eventually change must come --- but how? I won't even hint in the direction of a spoiler. This film is just too good. What I will say is that, if you watch carefully enough, you'll see aspects of humanity that receive far less attention than they should in modern cinema. All are brought to light without CGI special effects, sexual exploitation, or gratuitous violence. People looking for explosions, brutality, and special effects will be disappointed. But people looking for a film that rivals ""Winter's Bone"" will be richly rewarded. You'll find yourself asking why are there so few films like this, in which simple human kindness is rendered so

176,silverturquoise,A journey to the heart of trauma,9,22 January 2019,"This movie delivered a level of insight that I didn't expect into a condition that so many suffer from and are misunderstood - trauma and PTSD. On the surface, there is an unusual plot about a father and daughter living in the wilderness, with spectacular cinematography in the majestic forest of the Pacific Northwest. The lush plant life and peaceful surroundings are simply breathtaking. They are an amazing team that has mastered camping as a lifestyle and made the woods their home. Beneath the surface, however, there is a constant undercurrent of fear, primarily of being evicted from the government-owned park that they are illegally camping in. On a trip into the city to get monthly supplies and stop at the local VA office, the father reveals he is a veteran suffering from PTSD, struggling to raise his daughter in the only environment where he feels safe...isolated from other people and outside any community. After returning to the park, someone spots the daughter, and shortly thereafter, they are evicted and turned over to social services. The manner in which the social workers attempt to help the family demonstrates a lack of understanding of trauma. The father must complete a lengthy questionnaire containing hundreds of questions that repeatedly trigger his anxiety. When he is reunited with his daughter and they are placed in subsidized housing, they are settled hundreds of miles away from the forest in a farming area. Ironically, he is given a job cutting Christmas trees where he is subjected to loud industrial cutters and helicopters all day long. While the social workers meant well and tried to avoid settling them in a city, they didn't really meet his needs or provide any therapy or services for his disability. When the father and daughter leave to return to the woods, the daughter realizes that she not only wants but needs to be part of community with other peers and families. Because they go further North instead of returning to the woods where we see them at the beginning of the film, they encounter challenges from the cold and unexpected injuries. The daughter takes action to get help and in doing so, brings them to a community that is more well suited to their needs. The people live simply and harmoniously, but also understand the father's struggles and accept him as he is. As her father recuperates there from injuries, she decides she wants to live there and not return to camping alone in the woods. I think the movie is aptly titled - Leave No Trace. It's a great guideline for camping and hiking in our beautiful parklands...but it's also a matter of survival for soldiers to leave no trace for the enemy to find and kill them. And unfortunately, it can also be the end result of trauma ... where we find no trace of the vibrant person we knew before.

While the forest is immersive and beautiful at first, it quickly becomes a blank, green slate. I didn't find Tom's arc believable. She knows the forest. She has adapted and made it convenient for her life. Even to see the convenience of real life like a warm enclosures and various foods, it's still not what she's adapted to. She should've remained uncomfortable. Instead, it was only her father, Will, who couldn't adapt to a normalcy that was once his normal.

Quite honestly, I think this movie provokes your imagination and that may be its goal, however, it seems a little too essy to make a film that relies on your imagination for the most part.The acting was OK, but it seems that most viewers either hate it or love it. To me that really shows how much of the acting was really just a matter of being very consistent, but in style and not in terms of quality, variety or dimensions.The characters were in my opinion unrealistic. As others pointed out, the girl shows no sign of being held captive as it were. This storyline was clearly an afterthought and the dad hardly justifies his behavior. Many details were left open in order for some mystery to exist but that's another way for lazy story writing if you ask me.My summary is 'Clean version of life' - Right, so the story clearly all about people, social differences and culture. But how come this story and theme is brought to live with such so little nuance and differentiating scenes. It seems like the world is just one big happy family and surely there must be some factor that puts things in perspective.

201,Drogan-Hex,Sensational,9,4 April 2021,"Directing: Debra Granik attempts to tell a story that must be told and people need to know about, and it is crucially important for this message to come across from different perspectives that include his own, his daughter's and people they encounter. Debra did a phenomenal job at that, she managed to take the viewer to see and experience the world through their eyes which made it a great movie to watch.Production: A thumbs up to the production team for picking Eagle Fern Park in Clackamas County to shoot this movie which is where the original story in the novel 'My Abandonment' takes place. It was shot in the spring of 2017 in Portland, it premiered on January of 2018 and was released on June of that year.Script: Written by Granik and Anne Rosellini, the script is based on the 2009 novel 'My Abandonment' by Peter Rock which is based on a true story. To be honest, the script was not a masterpiece. Many improvements could have made it even better but imho these small details are hardly noticeable and can easily be missed.Acting: Ben Foster outdid himself and did a great job taking the role of the father, as well Thomasin McKenzie whom I have been a fan of for a while now and see great potential in her future.Cinema and sound: When it comes to sound and the atmosphere, I was in a way unmoved by the choice of music. I am just not a fan of this type of low orchestral tone. However, Dickon's music does fit the theme of the movie so no objections there. Camera work was as it was supposed to be, beautiful cinematography and nature sequences.Conclusion: Do not walk into this movie expecting action which would normally be expected from a movie classed under adventure. It is a great story of a father and daughter going through challenging events that will change their lives forever.

2. You expect some 3-dimensional depth to the characters;

205,elliot-75668,Sensitive and moving.,8,16 December 2018,"Leave No Trace is about a father and daughter who try to live their lives completely off the grid, leaving as little of a trace to their existence as possible. They do this by living in the woods and going to the local town for only the most basic of supplies. However, when Tom (Thomasin McKenzie) is spotted by a jogger she and her father (Ben Foster) are forced to find a living situation more suitable for her. The pair try to adapt, however, as Tom reaches a precarious age the two want different things.Leave no Trace is like Captain Fantastic but without the sanctimonious smugness that made Captain Fantastic such an aggravating experience. Leave No Trace perfectly balances the rights and wrongs of both of the two different lives, leaving for a quite thought-provoking experience. Even though Tom was well cared for by her father, and educated at a level above her age, her living conditions were not suitable for a stable life (especially when the cold climate almost takes a heavy toll).The caring and loving relationship between the pair makes the film delicately touching and engaging. Because of this there were times I was frustrated with Will failing to consider what was right for his daughter. It wasn't his fault (because of the PTSD), but because I cared deeply for the characters I was frustrated at the whole scenario of Tom being forced to move as soon as she settled in her new environment. It's a testament to Debra Granik's deft touch in the director's chair that the film is quite as sensitively profound as it is.The two central performances are superb with Ben Foster displaying ruggedness with a sensitive vulnerability and Thomasin McKenzie's beautifully natural performance suggests that she has a promising career ahead of her.",Leave No Trace

He seems mostly functional aside from that, being a loving and supportive father. How long have they been living in the woods?Maybe my reaction says more about me than it does about the movie. I went to see it with family members having never heard of it. I saw it had a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes and I was sold. The score shouldn't be misinterpreted: it is a percentage of reviews that were more positive than negative, it is NOT saying the movie is X percentage good. Instead, it's the likelihood you will like something more than you dislike it. Since I gave the movie a 6/10, I suppose the RT score didn't let me down. If forced into a thumbs up/down binary choice, I would have to point mine up...But just barely. I found the movie too slow, and the subject matter handled with an ambiguity that undermined its thematic intentions. Will bore no resemblance to any vets with PTSD that I've ever met (and I've met a few). His condition seems simultaneously exaggerated and downplayed, the way it effects him just didn't ring true for me. I do appreciate seeing a movie attempting to tackle the subject, however.No fault on the part of the two leads, both of whom are terrific, and mining the most out of underwritten characters. Or the unobtrusive, simple, but lovely cinematography, which brilliantly captures Portland and its surrounding environs.My weeping family members would probably be aghast that I was so Ho-hum on this one, and I don't expect this review to be popular, but since it is being so well received I felt the need to make a case for its genial mediocrity.",Leave No Trace

213,JackInColumbia,That is not how you write abstract backstories for characters...,5,3 May 2019,"Somewhere near the end of the first half of this movie, something really bad happened to me.... I got bored, and i mean really bored.The reason?This movie in its entirety is seeing two people, a father and his daughter, running away from other people and, as they admit to themselves, not knowing where exactly they are going.And that's the problem. We are given so little to care about these two charactes and their unusual struggle, especially for the father, Will, who is essentially the reason for their constant running. As far as I know, we only learn two things about him in the entire movie: 1) he has lost his wife. 2) he is a military veteran. And you have to understand that the second thing is revealed only near the end of the movie.Now, I understand that this movie is about the father having PTSD, but the way they presented it was just awful. For the biggest part of this movie we have absolutely no clue why the father is taking all these dumb and incosiderate to his daughter decisions and actions. At the point in which we can start guessing what his deal is, it is all over.... I have lost my interest for the character, if I ever had any, and generally, I simply could not find myself caring about him at any point in this movie. His daughter, Tom, isn't that special either. Most of the time she just follows her father around without ever being able to communicate her thoughts with him properly, getting herself in danger because of her father's stupid decisions and only taking a stand at the end of the movie, refusing to follow him any further. These two part ways and.... the film ends. And when you lose interest in the charactes, when you refuse your viewers some additional information to keep them invested, that's what happens: the story becomes just that, two random people running around with no purpose...It's also worth noting the way other people are depicted in this movie. Again, I understand that the story was trying to contrast the way the father was seeing the world and the reality where people can be welcoming and make you feel like home, but........ why was everyone so damn nice? Everyone is so nice that it ends up feeling forced and contrived. This is better illustrated by the scene with the bees. Tom lets the bees sit on her hands to show her dad that, just like the bees which don't try to sting her, a community, other people's warmth will not harm you. But that's another problem: bees WILL try to sting you! It's not all sweet honey! So the way they depict other people here shows either wishful thinking, in the best case or in the worst case, naivety.What really kept the movie going for me was McKenzie's performance. Foster did a decent job I guess, but nothing special.Cinematography was also competent, though I did feel like some scenes were longer than they should have been.All in all, by no means this was a bad movie. But it's also something I could not easily bring myself to recommend...",Leave No Trace
214,jmkosinski,Meditative journey through the Pacific Northwest,8,8 July 2018,"The first 30 minutes of this film, I would rate as a 9 or even a 10. We are immersed in the soft, jade glow of the Pacific rainforest, and the quiet intimate life of two people who barely need language to communicate. Their relationship with nature is practical and intuitive rather than sentimental and abstract. When the characters do visit the city, it feels cold and alien, full of possibilities but also dangers.Both actors are amazing, especially the young girl. For a young actress to express such mixed emotions clearly is very impressive. The movie has a very rooted sense of place. I was at a Q & A with the director and it was clear she made a very thorough effort to choose locations and actors (professional and amateurs) with an eye for realism. I only knock this story because the arc is fairly predictable. For an American movie there is remarkably little plot and no villain or hero.

Unless you are in the loving father mood, I would recommend staying away. We expected a bit too much I guess, a little action, some suspense but hell no, none of that is in here. The first 30 minutes were ok, building the story and all, the daughter character is pretty good with the acting, but then it just keeps getting slower and slower and man it gets so predictable half way through the movie and half of us already knew how it was going to end.

He tromped through the woods, not once scanning the terrain to detect traps and assess utility. The pathetic outdoor technique exhibited were incongruous with the type of hard-set experience earned by a shell-shocked Marine.Using plastic to catch water and wood shavings to ignite fire are tired props. How about showing snares and traps? And he never erected defensive measures? Why didn't he leave bits of food to deter the dogs so they could get away?As a vet, I can maintain the psychology is unrealistic. Combat vets who are primary care of a charge don't wander around aimlessly in the woods. He'd either fall into such a depression he wouldn't travel with her, or he'd focus on teaching the girl how to survive and defer his PTSD.Service animals are routinely prescribed for shell shocked vets because taking care of another transfers thoughts away from the self and depression. Mental and physical activity is the best coping mechanism for PTSD.The movie received a 100% critic rating and near that for users on rotten tomatoes. So I was expecting a stellar experience. Throughout it I wanted pull out my own teeth. At the end, I shrugged ""so what?""The acting was well done but what was the point? The writer could have gone down some interesting roads, describing more unusual survival skills. Or showcasing how the girl's homeschooling was superior to current curriculae.Also, what a depressing flick! If I saw a character in this movie smile, it was fleeting. It sucked the joy right out of the house. The girl was the only interesting character, the father just lumbered and moped.

Here, instead, we have an interesting and engrossing story that unfolds before us, yet we yearn to understand a bit more of what led up to where we are today... What experiences made Ben Foster's character how he is today? What, exactly, are his demons? Without spoiling too much, I'll just say that serious, life-altering decisions must eventually be made, and as an invested viewer, I feel a bit robbed that I'll never really know what informed these decisions.

And should Thomasin McKenzie prove to be able to do any other part (any!) this might be the breakout performance of the year. Leave no trace revolves heavily around the two main characters, the father and the daughter. He clearly suffers from some sort of trauma from his time in the service, and she follows him, understanding his plight. The movie explains very little, hints some things, and focuses heavily on the characters. I think as a understated movie it holds up decently, and it could have been a great one. But it fails to reward the viewers patience fully, as the third act dissapoints.

Seems to me that would cause a PTSD sufferer more stress than the benign places they found.

It can be slow in parts, confronting throughout, and quite depressing for the most part. However, thanks to some sublime performances from Ben Foster and, more notably, Thomasin Mckenzie, who I am sure is going to have a fantastic career, the film is truly wonderful. The direction from Debra Granik also deserves credit for the way that she has been able to bring out the best in her cast members. I would highly recommend this film because of the way that it shows a character struggling with PTSD. How this film did not pick up any awards is beyond me, in my view, it is a step above any of the Oscar nominees from 2019.",Leave No Trace

While it was well made, good acting, well filmed etc, at the end I was left feeling frustrated and quite angry. I found the father portrayed in the film quite selfish. The option he chose to leave his daughter was unwarranted, reckless and showed lack of parental responsibility. He had many choices, I know this as I have worked with veterans for many years. This veteran had obviously been offered treatment, he was seen attending a Hospitsl for treatment, and then selling his meds. We're meant to believe that the facility had no treatment which is suitable for him, med based or otherwise, which is complete rubbish. There are a number of successful and evidence based treatments around. A combination of medication and treatment can be highly successful. This father was also offered a reasonable alternative to life in the forest. He was given a home in the country, on a farm, away from others and his daughter could attend school, whether or not he had the capacity for work or not. Even when they left here they eventually ended up in an even more remote location with a small group of very understanding people. They could've lived in this community too. The daughter would've had a home, the father could've gone out bush for weeks or months if he needed to, and still maintained contact with his daughter and watch her grow. She could've left food out by the tree like they had for another fella; the father could've continued treatment etc, I don't think going out bush, when you have PTSD, know you've left your beloved daughter alone and without anything, is really going to help your survival. Perhaps suicide was his final solution. A poor choice if your're a loving parent- what is your daughter to think about her abandonment?
I would've preferred to see the journey of a man who struggles with his demons following his return from duty, but who succeeds in recovering his life, not perfectly perhaps, but still with meaning. Give veterans and their families some hope.",Leave No Trace

It does however ask the affected ex-vet to not take down the rest of us with him. No one is sure how to deal with him and his condition. But, Like it or not the film suggests such a sever case is best to disappear, into the woods for example, leave no trace, emerge once in a while to collect some food we leave him, like a tribute to a ghost, and disappear again.

Both actors in the film have real talent in their subdued, strong emotions. There is a worthwhile philosophical question at the heart of the film too related to how society views people who choose a different life than the cookie-cutter existence of getting a job, buying or renting a house, and working til you're dead and calling that normal compared to how the characters were living before society got in their way.
At the same time, the father in the story has alot of problems he's dealing with which bring up the dark side too of their way of life which at first could have been seen as heroic. Its not all just a superior choice over what society foists upon people and is based on problems unresolved.

But as a father in this movie asked to his daughter 'do you really care that other people will think of you?'.
I enjoyed this movie and if it's a slow movie, it doesn't always mean, that it's the boring or the useless one. It really depends on your mind, will you like it or not. Because it's a deep one, no need so many conversations for it, if you can understand people emotions/feelings, go for it.
But in other hand, it wasn't the best movie I have ever watched, but somehow I expected more. I really liked the quality, there wasn't empty conversations, as I already mentioned, but I can't understand the fathers actions and why is he running from himself all the time. Yeah, I guess, there are reasons for it, but still. Can't really understand the main point of this, actually.

The number of damaged humans returning from war and highly publicised instances of what really happens when people experiencing what they have experienced, and returning to a more orderly society, well casts doubt on the benign and paternal behavior ehibited by the star of this movie.

This is the first film I've actually reviewed after 10+ years on IMDb. Clearly some people are unimpressed by this film and others think it's amazing; I am in the latter category.I'm also someone who, when I was a kid, fantasized about what it would be like to live off the land and away from people. This is a truly unique film in that it does not spell it out for you; does not have a position; it does not have villains; It is willing to let you make your own conclusions. Clearly this bothers some people, as does the pace. Speaking for myself, I was never bored. I was riveted from beginning to end. I had never seen the trailer, and I would recommend not seeing the trailer.A main complaint from those who don't like it seems to be there are enough bad people; I actually found this refreshing. I don't meet many bad, evil people in my every day life; most people are pretty cool, I find. I actually felt the fundamental premise of the movie was realistic and I appreciated that it was willing to skip ahead and not spell out every beat. Or fill in the backstory. A good film can choose the story it wants to tell and does not need to fill in every interstitial space or to mimic the way things would necessarily unfold in the real world. I suppose it could be a realistic criticism that things could never quite happen this way, but it certainly did not bother me. I thought this film portrays people - and I mean all the characters in the film, not just the primary two - that are too rarely portrayed in film, but do exist in our world.As everyone seems to agree, the cinematography and acting are extraordinary. I also thought the story was unique and refreshing, and for me at least, the pacing was perfect. I believe I benefited from having no idea where it was going to go, so I would recommend skipping the trailer and seeing it for whatever reason compels you.

The actors portray the father-daughter beautifully, the tensions are well enacted and grips your attention. However, the lack of explanation, or any kind of backstory, the movie, in my opinion does not deliver. Why is he so traumatized? What happened to his unit in army? Why does he need to leave outside the society? What happened to the mom? None of these questions are answered. I concur with the comment that suggests that this movie only has a beginning but not middle or end. The 3 stars are for the awesome acting and camera work.",Leave No Trace

348,minervanz,"What Good Will Hunting did for BPD, this movie does for PTSD...",8,28 August 2018,"An exquisitely poignant movie about a father and daughter trying to live off the grid in the woods out of town. Ben Foster gives a truly amazing, understated performance as Will, the ""psychologically damaged"" father back from the un-named horrors of war, who has lost his wife and mother to his daughter, Tom. Thomasin McKenzie as Tom, brings a gentle, caring teenager, supporting her father, who is trying to retreat from the world into the woods.The film is beautifully shot, and the pair are very believable as they hide out from the authorities who want her ""in school"" and him in some gainful employment, separating and further traumatising both of them while doing the ""right thing"". But Will, with his unseen, unacknowledged PTSD, is unable to settle into ""normal"" suburban life, and needs to run constantly from his demons from the past.Ultimately there is a poignant decision to be made, as daughter and father can no longer walk the same pathways. But this movie has such depth, and such compassion for its characters, and their struggles, that even though you know that a climax must come, it still takes you by surprise. Wonderful acting from the supporting cast, including a cameo by Isaiah Stone, adding complexity to Tom's choices... But modern life cannot accommodate outliers, those who won't conform.This movie broke my heart, little by little, but has become my favourite indie movie for 2018. If you open your heart and mind, you will find it memorable. Oh, and no sex, drugs or rock and roll, nor animals were harmed - if you like your drama real and personal, and with no car chases or shoot 'em ups, this one is a winner!",Leave No Trace
349,jvojvo,Living off the grid is a personal choice for an adult.,8,18 July 2018,"The acting is superb. So is the directing and the forest. Being a parent requires sacrifice for the child or children. Will played by Ben Foster seems to have limited parenting skills when it comes to what is best for his daughter. Yes, he struggles with PTSD and her mother is missing from the film. I assume she died. Will has taught his daughter survival skills that are without a doubt a bonus from any father for a child. But... there comes a time when a parent must put their child's needs above their own. This is good parenting and the most difficult part of parenting. Thom's character Tom, learns as she goes. She finally sees the difference between her fathers ailments which lead to his parenting decisions and she realizes she can choose something different. And she does. It's a great film to look at yourself and discover what are my self imposed limitations and am I imposing them onto my children? Tough questions. No concrete answers, only choices in the end. Go see it. It's worth the afterthoughts.",Leave No Trace
350,drewpilcher-39515,"Great subtle storytelling, but I found the events to be unrealistic.",3,21 July 2018,"I really liked the style of this movie. Nothing is ever explained, and little is even said, but the plot is sort of inferred from peoples actions. The atmosphere is also perfect, very vivid in it's capture of different environments.Now here's why I didn't like it very much. This is going to be kind of a spoiler, so stop reading here if you haven't seen it.So, the *storytelling* is great, but I found the actual story to be unrealistic. Every time the characters encounter the outside world, even the grittier parts of it, they find it to be warm and welcoming. I think the writers did this so as not to distract from the real reason the father went off-grid; but it just comes off as totally contrived. Like it's one thing to have some unusual characters, but its just everybody. Nobody behaves in a realistic way; everyone's just ..too nice.My second problem is with the girl. Supposedly she's been raised in the woods for a long time, with just her dad and a couple of damp textbooks; but inexplicably whenever she finds herself in a social situation, shes perfectly well adjusted and shows no difficulty. It's a feel good moment when the girl meets a boy or an old woman, and just instantly makes a connection with them and has a nice conversation; but really?? Being in the woods for years had no effect on her?? It just doesn't make any sense.Basically they portray this totally intense situation; but inexplicably it doesn't seem to have any psychological effect on the characters. This made it very hard to *believe* anything that happened.",Leave No Trace
