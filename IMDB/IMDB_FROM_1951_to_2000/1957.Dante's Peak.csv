0,Leofwine_draca,Cheesy and sentimental...but still an excellent disaster movie,9,2 June 2016,"Although it's true that blockbuster movies have been dumbing down of late, I thoroughly enjoyed this clichéd but fun old-fashioned adventure yarn which has Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton on the run from all manner of special effects grooviness. Although the film has a slow first half, this is well worth sitting through as the incredible action climax has it all: lakes full of acid, flowing lava, falling ash and a huge, destructive, pyroclastic cloud.Okay, so I could have done without the incredibly annoying children in the film who repeatedly do stupid things and have to get rescued. I could do without the sickly sentimentalism which fills many scenes and the boring, needless character development. I could do without the stupid old woman who thankfully gets fatally injured but then takes about a year to die. I could do without Linda Hamilton's non-acting of a one-dimensional town mayor who is forever in peril. Come to think of it I could do without all of the expository prologue in which we get to know the characters: one long film of Brosnan escaping from various hazards would have done me just fine.Sadly, this is not the case, and it seems like an age for the action to really begin. But when it does, it really hits home, thanks to some really stunning CGI work which flawlessly recreates rivers of molten lava and huge ash clouds which demolish buildings in an instant. The film manages to evoke a whole load of tense moments when Brosnan's car gets stuck in the lava, when a van tries to escape from a broken bridge and when survivors escape over an acid lake while their boat gradually dissolves around them. The pace starts off slow but builds up to the top-notch finale.If you're looking for a dumb, mindless, action-filled extravaganza then you've come to the right place. Despite ripping off other films like TWISTER, this manages to be better than many an effect-led blockbuster thanks to a high mortality rate and plenty of edge-of-your-seat moments. Do yourself a favour, settle back one evening, rent this and switch off your brain.",Dante's Peak
1,SnoopyStyle,not good disaster movie,4,22 August 2015,"Volcanologist Harry Dalton (Pierce Brosnan) lost his partner in a volcano eruption in Columbia. Four years later, he's working at the US Geological Survey at the Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, Washington. A report comes in and Harry is sent to Dante's Peak. The town is celebrating being voted the 2nd most desirable place to live. Mayor Rachel Wando (Linda Hamilton) drives Harry around with her kids. They find a couple boiled to death in a hot springs. Along with other signs, Harry wants to place an alert but his politics-playing boss Dr. Paul Dreyfus overrules him.It seems like a more realistic volcano movie in the first half which may not actually make it a good disaster movie. A disaster movie needs to be fun more than being accurate. There are also some inconsistencies. At one moment, Harry is convinced of impending doom. The next moment, he's setting up a town meeting to discuss an evacuation many hours later. In a disaster movie, he should be pushing for an immediate evacuation while he battles resistance. The last half is more of an action-packed disaster movie. Why the mayor doesn't send her kids to safety right away is beyond me. It becomes a random series of close calls.",Dante's Peak
2,Prismark10,Dante's unleashed hell,4,20 November 2013,"Dante's Peak was released a year after Independence Day which set new standards in destruction of buildings. Unfortunately, disaster films became fashionable (Twister was released in 1996) and two were released in 1997 that had exploding volcanoes.This one regarded as the better of the two as it had James Bond in it.The film starts brightly enough. Brosnan plays a workaholic volcanologist, Harry Dalton who has trauma issues. He is sent to a small town in Washington State. He soon discovers that a dormant volcano might be showing signs of coming to life.Harry has a warm relationship with the town's mayor (Linda Hamilton.) The town of Dante's Peak is in danger. However some of the townsfolk who seemed to have formerly resided in Amity Island 20 years earlier before a great white shark attacked do not want to scare off the tourists.Dalton's boss is all for keeping things quiet and not scare off people.However the volcano does erupt putting lives at risk. Dalton and the Mayor with her family must evade the oncoming lava.The set up is good but rather corny. Brosnan's work colleagues are a little bit too hip. The special effects were the best part of the film when the volcano erupts and damages the town with very good miniature effects and CGI. Although the CGI has aged over the years.The film itself is a little hokey, the script rather shaky and maybe it needed another draft or two. The conclusion seemed rather rushed.",Dante's Peak
3,mark.waltz,Blowing the lid off this silly but entertaining movie,7,18 May 2004,"Yes, ""Dante's Peak"" is entertaining; Watching it for the third time around, I had to laugh at some of the parts I hadn't picked up on or had forgotten from my two previous viewing experiences.  Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton, two action/adventure stars, do little to expand their acting abilities.  The rest of the cast doesn't give us much more than panicked looks, with the exception of Brosnan's boss, who does give a somewhat believable reasons to not take news of an impending volcano burst seriously. The kids aren't impressive and the manipulative script wants us to worry about their fate.  The grandmother (Elizabeth Hoffman, mother of the ""Sisters"" TV clan) and her dog live up on a lake near the mountain, and it is her refusal to leave her home which causes the kids and the adult leads to stay behind while the rest of the town is escaping, most to no avail.There are genuine moments of suspense, such as watching the force of the massive earthquake which hits the town while the volcano in the background is showing off its smokey exterior.  Then, we get a massive volcano cloud which chases the two adults and the kids into a mine, supposedly part of the mountain range connected to Dante's Peak.  There is also an impressive raging river scene where Brosnan's crew attempt to escape.  One of the victims gives such a convincing look of knowing his fate that it is even more horrific than watching them go through it.  Seeing this film sadly made me think of those victims of 9/11 and the horror they faced, so at least the film had one memorable impact on me.  However, if Hollywood ever dares to make a 9/11 survival story, I hope we don't get the type of disaster epic they do here.  No forced romances, no over emotional kids to force the tears out, but just real people dealing with a horrific situation.  Had ""Dante's Peak"" not tried for 30's style pathos, it could have worked; Survival by itself is a gripping story that you don't need to add those cliches. 
The same year of ""Dante's Peak"", we also got ""Volcano"", which gave me unintentional chuckles in the theatre I saw it at (the Beverly Center) because that same shopping center was demolished in it, as were several local buildings I see almost every day.  While both films were silly in many ways, I enjoyed ""Dante's Peak"" more for its colorful country photography. Hollywood has not had a great time doing volcano movies; ""The Last Days of Pompeii"" (1935) is a small budgeted epic which is fun because of the cliches of the time it was made; ""Krakatowa, East of Java"" (1969) is even sillier because it was obviously filmed backwards (according to Leonard Maltin, Krakatowa is actually WEST of Java!).  The all-time worst is ""When Time Ran Out"" (1980), Irwin Allen's final disaster epic in which the cast was as boring as the subplots they had to deal with, and even the volcano explosions were unmemorable.  My favorite volcano movie by far has to be ""The Devil at 6 O'Clock"" (1961)  with Spencer Tracy and Frank Sinatra. While I haven't seen it in some time, I recall it with fondness, at least compared to the five other movies I have mentioned.  At least ""Dante's Peak"" has some laughs for the ridiculous twists which come throughout.  If you can look at it with tongue-in-cheek and not take it too seriously beyond the I'm-determined-to-survive plot, you may have a good time.  While I'm sure some folks did cry at the overly use of cymbols in the finale, I found myself crying, too---that is from too much unintentional laughter!",Dante's Peak
4,lee_eisenberg,"more like the sort of thing that you'd have to watch in ""Dante's Inferno""",1,16 May 2005,"They must have paid Pierce Brosnan a LOT of money to get him to star in this dreck. The storyline is a total cliché (scientist warns town about volcano, they don't listen, volcano erupts and kills some people, hero survives with his friends). The whole thing must be an outright embarrassment for everyone involved. ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" was at least so bad that it was funny. ""Dante's Peak"" is only so bad that it makes your eyes roll, what with sappy relationships and vomit-inducing reminders of ""the human spirit"". HOW MANY DISASTER MOVIES CAN THEY POSSIBLY MAKE? One goal that all people will have to have in the near future will be avoiding this movie at all costs. There are plenty of B-movies that don't insult your intelligence, like ""The Brain that Wouldn't Die"".",Dante's Peak
5,jboothmillard,Dante's Peak,6,5 June 2006,"There's a history of same themed films competing against each other the same year, these include computer animated bug movies A Bug's Life and Antz, and meteor movies Deep Impact and Armageddon, this is when the volcano movies went against each other in 1997, here against Tommy Lee Jones and Anne Heche in Volcano, from director Roger Donaldson (Species, The World's Fastest Indian). Basically vulcanologist Harry Dalton (Pierce Brosnan) lost his girlfriend Marianne (Walker Brandt) four years ago during a volcano eruption in Columbia, and he is being called by boss Paul Dreyfus (Charles Hallahan) to investigate another one. The town of Dante's Peak, Washington is located next to a large mountain, that is a dormant volcano, and some unusual activity has been reported that needs looking. So while Harry and his team are investigating he meets and gets to know town mayor and food and drinks' store owner Rachel Wando (Linda Hamilton) and her children, daughter Lauren (Jamie Renée Smith) and son Graham (Jeremy Foley). Noticeable events around the town that the volcano might be waking up include lake water heating dramatically and killing two people, and some minor earthquakes, but Paul doesn't think the town should be on alert. As soon as Harry presents evidence of the town's water supply containing sulphur this triggers the need to start an evacuation, but when this plan begins that is when the volcano finally erupts. Harry, Rachel and the children are now racing against time to get out of the town and avoid the blasts, the lava flows, the acid turned water, the rushes of water, and from the final blast the powerful Pyroclastic cloud. Also starring Elizabeth Hoffman as Ruth, True Lies' Grant Heslov as Greg, Kirk Trutner as Terry Furlong, Arabella Field as Nancy, Tzi Ma as Stan, Brian Reddy as Les Worrell, Lee Garlington as Dr. Jane Fox and Bill Bolender as Sheriff Turner. Brosnan, best known then as James Bond, gives a good performance as the only man sure the mountain will blow, and Hamilton is also good as the woman who joins him during the chaos, but of course the real star is the mountain blasting out all the explosions, fire and lava, a likable disaster action adventure. Good!",Dante's Peak
6,ccthemovieman-1,Good Effects Make It Fun To Watch,7,21 April 2006,"This ""disaster film"" had some of the best special effects of its day (almost 10 years ago). I have to say ""of its day"" because technology has made CGI become dated quickly these days. This film is all about a volcano, a la Mt. St. Helen's, erupting and killing people and destroying a small town below it. Some of the scenes were just jaw- dropping and, at least for the first-time viewer, a lot of suspense over whether the main characters of the story will survive it.Of course, there are some credibility gaps in here, things that just could not happen such as little boy drive van up a mountain (when his feet wouldn't reach the foot pedals!) but you just go along for the ride and enjoy the tension and special effects even if the story gets a little hokey.It might not be the most intelligent film, but it's very entertaining 109 minutes, and that's the name of the business. It's good escapist fare, and that's all. It's worth two looks.",Dante's Peak
7,ma-cortes,Clichéd and predictable but agreeable disaster movie with overwhelming special effects,6,2 August 2019,"Norwest volcano causing death, destruction and wreak havoc , it serves up a smurgasboard of molten disaster on the second most desirable town in the US , the titular Dante's Peak . This impressive volcano has a computer-generator peak finally get lost among the deadly emissions ,as it packs an awesome and destructive power enhanced in big screen by the stereophonic sound. It stars Pierce Brosnan as one of the most experienced scientists in the United States Geological Survey (USGS) , and a 4 years bachelor after he lost his sweetheart to a volcanic eruption in Columbia . As Brosnan is an intuitive sismologist who along with other volcanologists : Charles Hallahan , Grant Heslov , Tzi Ma , Kirk Trutne , Arabella Field predicting imminent catastrophe , while local councillors insist there's no need for panic . As geologist Brosnan comes to Washington to match wits with the towners and joins forces with the Mayor femme Wando , Linda Hamilton . Although some scientists invoking lack of real physical evidence while actually being afraid of causing huge financial losses for the investors, and countermands Brosnan's alert. Only the brave scientific Brosnan and spunky Mayor Hamilton stand between the breathtaking volcanic mountain and meldown . The pressure is building... Whatever you do, don't look back .Acceptable disaster movie paced in fits and starts with a great cast, though a little wasted. The first 1997's Volcano movies acquits itself well in the spectacle department , but it is dwarfed by colournes characters . Flick follows the Disaster genre playbook , page by page , as script takes a backseat to nonstop action . A wonderful location has to deal with a horrible volcano , mudslides , raging fires , it is completely toasted by millions of gallons of molten lava . Ashes fall like snow , computer generator lava flows profusely , poisonous gases leak out and water turns acid all with desired nail-biting, jaw-dropping effects. The most striking aspect of this fun , old-fashioned catastrophe movie is the novelty of seeing the familiar of backdrops used as a creative recourse in its own right . As all of them have to escape through ash that falls like rain, lava, acid lakes and a pyroclastic cloud to getaway from the volcano. As an exercice in catastrophe movie logistics , this is on a par with ¨Twister¨, and it was made at the same time to ¨Volcano¨(1997) by Mick Jackson with Tommy Lee Jones , Anna Heche , John Corbett , Gaby Hoffman . This was a successful catastrophe movie that belongs to Disaster movie genre that in the 70s and 80s achieved splendor such as : Towering inferno, Poseidon, Beyond Poseidon, The swarm, Avalanche, The Russian rollercoaster, Avalanche express , Airport I, II, III.. and whose main representative was producer Irwin Allen . The fine cast cannot save this passable film , at all . It lacks deep characterization , displaying some boring moments and a tiring script that was presumibly well paid . Duo protagonists : Brosnan , Hamilton work hard to dig up an emotional rapport , while the slow but inexorable progress of the lava makes for more suspense than the usual slam bang firework display . It has Brosnan the standard take-charge guy , a volcanologist attempting to avert total destruction while being assisted by the brawny but beautiful Mayor , Linda Cameron . Wondo Mayor Hamilton along with her two children : Jamie Renée Smith , Jeremy Foley , Grandmother : Elizabeth Hoffman and dog lend the regular charm and the traditional as well as beloved requisite to be a film for the whole family .It packs state-of-art and breathtaking special effects by computer generator that are far more varied and genuinely terrifying . It contains an atmospheric and adequate cinematography by Andrzej Bartkowiak . Being shot on lcation in Mount St. Helens, National Volcanic Monument, Baker Hot Springs, Mt. Baker National Forest, Washington, Mexican Town Movie Ranch, Saugus, Veluzat Motion Picture Ranch, Saugus, Agua Dulce, California . And a thrilling and enjoyable musical score by John Frizzel .The motion picture was professionally directed by Roger Donaldson , though it has some flaws . Donaldon's first film, Sleeping dogs (1977), was the first made in New Zealand in 15 years and also the first to be shown in American theaters. Roger is a good director and producer, known for The Bounty (1984) , No way out (1987) , Burt Munro (2005), Species (1995) and Cocktail (1988), among others . Rating : 6/10 . It is exactly for the whole family .",Dante's Peak
8,michaelRokeefe,Explosive! The sleeping giant erupts.,6,1 March 2002,"Very realistic special effects in this disaster yarn about a volcanologist(Pierce Brosnan) who tries to warn the citizens of Dante's Peak, Washington of impending doom.

9,poolandrews,Since when do trucks have snorkel's? Watchable big budget disaster flick.,6,30 July 2008,"Dante's Peak is set four years after United States Geologist Harry Dalton (Pierce Brosnan) lost his girlfriend Marianne (Walker Brandt) to an erupting volcano & starts as his boss Dr. Paul Dreyfus (Charles Hallahan) calls him to go to the small Northern Cascade town of Dante's Peak to carry out some basic checks. Harry travels to Dante's Peak & quickly becomes convinced that the volcano overlooking the town which has laid dormant for years is about to erupt. At first no-one believes him & the townsfolk don't want to scare local businessmen away from the area so try to keep it quiet, unfortunately Harry is right & the volcano erupts with the entire town of Dante's Peak in it's destructive path...Directed by Roger Donaldson this fairly entertaining big budget natural disaster film which demonstrates how vicious the fury of mother nature can be is one of two halves, the first half is rather talky & is there merely to pass the time until the second half when the volcano actually erupts so the big budget special effect set-piece action scenes & destruction can begin. The script follows the usual disaster film rules, it focuses in on one person who know's whats coming yet no-one believes them & their attempts to warn people, it also focuses in on a normal family to add a bit of human interest & in particular two cute little kids, there's even a bit of dramatic incident when a couple of the main character's die although you don't really care that much as most of them are pretty clichéd. I am not sure if Dante's Peak is scientifically accurate or not although one would suspect that factual liberties have been taken in the name of entertainment, the acid lake at the end for instance just doesn't sound that plausible to me. Once the action kicks in Dante's Peak becomes a lot of fun amid all the destruction, near misses & special effects although it takes quite a while to get there & the journey there isn't entirely pleasant. Also someone should tell the makers of Dante's Peak that lava has a temperature in excess of 1000 °C & trying to drive through it with rubber tyres would just not work. At all.Unusually the special effects in Dante's Peak is a mix of traditional model work, on set mechanics & effects & CGI computer effects rather than if it was made these days as it would almost certainly be entirely CGI. The mixture of special effects work highlights the respective strengths & weaknesses, the model work for instance sometimes doesn't quite match up to the on-set stuff as the shades of colour of cars & the light in the sky can differ slightly between shots & of course CGI can at times just look like a bad computer graphic but overall I did like the mixture of effects work & the budget was suitably high enough for them to be of a good standard throughout. The final forty odd minutes features plenty of action & destruction from exploding helicopters to rivers of lava, from raging rivers to acid lakes, from collapsing Churches to collapsing freeways, from crashing cars to daring rescues, from out-driving eruptions to collapsing mines to the destruction of an entire town there's enough packed into the final forty minutes to keep anyone entertained, it's just a shame about the first hour or so that feels rather pedestrian & forgettable by comparison.With a supposed budget of about $104,000,000 this had a lot of money spent on it, mostly during the final forty odd special effects laden minutes I would assume. Filmed around California the actual St. Helens volcano was in Washington & was digitally added to various shots while the town used was in Idaho. The acting is alright, Brosnan & Hamilton make for a fairly forgettable & dull duo while the kids are annoying.Dante's Peak is a perfectly watchable big budget disaster flick showcasing how savage mother nature can be, while the last forty minutes is undoubtedly where the majority of the entertainment value lies the film as a whole is decent enough.",Dante's Peak

11,zardoz-13,"""Dante's Peak"" Reeks!",6,20 March 2008,"You know who is going to die in ""White Sands"" director Roger Donaldson's predictable but explosive disaster epic ""Dante's Peak,"" co-starring Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton, long before the rogue volcano erupts and cremates a small Idaho resort town. This $100 million dollar plus opus is the second major Hollywood disaster flick to explode across the big-screen, trailing the Sylvester Stallone epic ""Daylight."" Meanwhile, ""Dante's Peak"" imitates but never surpasses previous classics like the 1972 version of ""The Poseidon Adventure"" or the 1974 opus ""Earthquake."" Interestingly, audiences will find little in the way of sex, nudity, violence, and profanity to complain about in this harmless, PG-13 rated, special effects laden melodrama.Brosnan plays volcanologist Harry Dalton who has just recovered from a South American blast that claimed his girlfriend's life. Four years later, as Dalton is about to embark on a vacation, his boss sends him off to the Pacific Northwest to check out a sleeping volcano. Dalton arrives in the small town at the foot of the volcano as its Mayor Rachel Wando (Linda Hamilton of ""The Terminator"") accepts an award for hailing her hamlet the second best place to live. When Dalton alerts them about the volcano, the townspeople start to fidget. They have just convinced an investor to erect a million-dollar business in their town. Dalton's boss rolls in not long afterward and calms their fears. He appreciates the damage that a false alarm can do and tells Dalton to take a hike. Dalton decides to stick around as much for the volcano as the pretty mayor.""Daylight"" scenarist Leslie Bohem's less than molten script criss-crosses scenes from Steven Spielberg's ""Jaws"" and James Goldstone's ""When Time Ran Out."" ""Dante's Peak"" turns out to be just as formulaic as both ""Jaws"" and ""When Time Ran Out."" You know that the dog that gets lost will be rescued before the lava flows fry him. The characters that shrug at the idea that the volcano will ignite get their just comeuppance.""Dante's Peak"" gets off to a riveting start with a volcanic eruption in South America, and then subsides as the filmmakers lay out the story and deploy their characters. Of course, Mayor Wando has been left high and dry by his husband and has two children to raise. Gradually, signs of danger appear and Dalton smells the ash in the air before the mountain blasts itself to smithereens. Two lusty teenagers die early when a hot springs pond scorches them alive. Despite solid computer evidence to the contrary that the volcano won't explode, Dalton keeps crying wolf until it is too late.The early matte shots of the volcano look rather cheesy, but the eruption sequence is as well done as the nuclear blast in Andrew Davis' ""Chain Reaction."" Freeways collapse and buildings crash into rubble as extras dodge flying debris and howl in agony. Director Ronald Donaldson, who also helmed ""Species,"" ""The Getaway,"" and ""The Bounty,"" seems more preoccupied with hysteria than gut-wrenching shock tactics. Nothing really scary or gory jumps out at you in ""Dante's Peak."" A couple of decent scenes stand out in an otherwise staple plot. A boat ride down a river turned into acid yields a chill or two, and your skin will crawl when Dalton legs it ahead of a lava flow.""Dante's Peak"" suffers because the cast consists largely of unknowns, so you won't feel much sorrow when a character croaks. Nobody dies a genuinely nasty death as in either ""The Poseidon Adventure"" or ""Earthquake."" Of course, Mayor Wando's children are thrust into harm's way so that Dalton and she can rescue them. ""Dante's Peak"" features a fearless grandmother that willing to risk death to save her relatives. Only toward the end when everything seems undeniably bleak does it look like our hero and heroine will survive this catastrophe. Although ""Dante's Peak"" is certainly no ""Twister,"" this potboiler should keep the kids entertained and might even occasionally distract adults, too.",Dante's Peak
12,Calicodreamin,An absolute classic!,8,7 September 2019,"Arguably one of the best disaster movies ever made. The cgi isn't that great, the acting isn't that great, heck even some of the volcano happenings aren't that scientifically accurate... but this is still a cult classic.

13,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,A thrill-ride,6,1 August 2010,"I was fortunate enough for this to air on TV. This has been on my mental to-check-out list for a couple of years, and I wasn't disappointed. It is very exciting and the tension is thick, the sense of imminent danger very convincing. You may already know the basic plot. A small town lies by a dormant volcano. James Bond is sent in to investigate if there is a risk. This builds up the eruption and subsequent utter chaos remarkably well, gradually, setting it up. It makes the events all the more effective. The FX are marvelous and hold up well; I understand that they were largely practical, and it really helps. This is fairly realistic, and it isn't as insulting as your average Roland Emmerich picture, although there are clichés in this. The dialog is good. This is genuinely funny and charming, if it does try too hard a couple of times. The acting is largely solid, even the kids aren't too bad. Brosnan and Hamilton are great in the lead roles. The characters are reasonably developed, if they don't really break the mold much. There is a ton of disturbing content in this. I recommend this to any fan of disaster flicks. 6/10",Dante's Peak
14,view_and_review,Hated It,4,9 October 2020,"In this episode of ""Same Movie Same Year"" we have ""Dante's Peak"" which was released a couple of months before ""Volcano."" To steal a line from In Living Color's Men on Films:""Hated it!""It's only slightly better than ""Volcano"" which featured an underground volcano in Los Angeles.""Dante's Peak"" starts with our main character, a volcanologist named Harry Dalton (Pierce Brosnan), somewhere in Colombia with his female partner during a volcanic eruption. The volcano killed his partner.Fast forward four years and Harry gets sent to Dante's Peak in order to investigate some strange activity there. Harry advises the town that they should look to evacuate because he has a good nose for these things. His supervisor, Paul Dreyfus (Charles Hallahan), overruled him because God forbid he create a panic and Dante's Peak doesn't blow. Imagine the financial impact. That'd be like telling people to stay at home to stave off the spread of an infectious disease when it isn't even here yet... Oh. Yeah.Of course, the volcano did blow, otherwise why have a movie called Dante's Peak? It did take a full 50 minutes to do its thing which made Harry look like a jumpy fearmonger. But that did give Harry time to begin a mini romance with town mayor, Rachel Wando (Linda Hamilton). In the meantime, city council member, Les Worell (Brian Reddy), doesn't want to scare off a big investor with volcano talk. You know, like the movie ""Jaws.""Eventually, the instrument data supported what Harry had believed all along, but by then it was too late; the town hadn't been evacuated and Dante's Peak blew which allowed us to see the remaining clichés.Who lived and who died?The helicopter pilot who wanted extra money when his services were desperately needed. He died, because jerks die. He was so stupid as to not know that the volcanic ash would clog his engine though a seismologist knew.Ruffy, the dog. Dogs never die even though people will risk life and limb to save them.Paul Dreyfus, the boss who would dare overrule Harry. He died, because if you don't believe the main character you die.Mayor Rachel Wando and kids. They lived. Rachel was conveniently single which made her the love interest and Hollywood would never allow two love interests to die in a single movie. And you can't kill off kids, even if their behavior is reckless (like driving to grandma's house during a volcano eruption to save her stubborn old arse).City council member, Les. He died because greedy people die.Harry. He's the hero, so he gets to save people and live.Disaster movies are such a waste. They're nothing more than big budget displays of special effects and impossible heroics. They never have any meat to them. They blow all the budget on the visual aspect leaving nothing for the plot or the characters. For those that they can dazzle and distract, it's a great movie. As for those, like myself, who are not easily impressed with explosions and widespread destruction, these movies are lousy.",Dante's Peak

The bad news is that everyone thinks he is over-reacting. The good news is that the town's Mayor is hot single mom Rachel (Linda Hamilton).After a lengthy set up (which is neither unreasonable nor uninteresting), the last hour is exciting and spectacular non-stop action. Somewhat improbable in terms of what our protagonists get up to as they try to survive the cataclysmic events, it is nonetheless the proverbial roller-coaster ride, with Brosnan's and Hamilton's screen presence and chemistry providing an excellent hook for audience identification to hang on.A very enjoyable movie.",Dante's Peak

Having been aware of the title since seeing ads for it during the early days of Sky Box Office,but never having seen it,I set off to reach the peak.View on the film:Rushed into production by the studio in order to get ahead of Volcano (1997) coming out, (Dante ended up coming out three months earlier,and being a bigger hit than Volcano) director Roger Donaldson & cinematographer Andrzej Bartkowiak erupt a Disaster Movie with a mighty crunchy atmosphere.The makers thankfully keep the CGI being used as part of, rather then the full, foundation for the special effect set-pieces,with delightfully old fashion practical effects and miniatures being supported by the CGI in spreading miles of destruction across the screen.When not burning down the house, the signs of the studio rushing the production rise to the suffice, thanks to a visible over reliance on shaky cam panning shots,where the characters are all lined up next to each other, (cutting time down on number of shots needed) which creates a lack of close-ups that would have given the action scenes a extra pop.The first of two times he'd work with Donaldson, (the other being The November Man (2014)) Pierce Brosnan gives a plucky performance as Harry Dalton, (named after Timothy Dalton?) whose slick action moves to avoid disaster, are pinned by Brosnan with Dalton pinning the risks made to his scientific calculations.Sharing a sweet chemistry with Brosnan as they drive away from the volcano,Linda Hamilton brings a unshakable determination to Wando, who faces disaster straight on whilst holding her family together tightly.Whilst unable to shake some Disaster Movie's old faithful (yes,a dog does outrun a volcano) the screenplay by Leslie Bohem makes a surprisingly sincere attempt at the science,with Dalton's USGS volcanologist background offering a lone voice mapping out a warning heading towards a explosive peak.",Dante's Peak

Great lava flowing effects are mixed with lack of credibility such as the boy who drives up into the mountains to warn his stubborn grandmother. This film is just filled with people with the IQ of a rock. Directed by Roger Donaldson who previously made the miserable Species. He has a cast of actors who probably wish that their schedules were more occupied when the script came to their attention. Brosnan is the hero whom nobody listens to because everybody seems to know so bloody much. Hamilton reduced to cardboard as the Mayor. Perhaps the script called for a female so she showed up fitting the bill. The rest of the cast is given little to do except watch their careers become a bigger disaster than the one in the film. Filled with clichés including the lame apology by those who didn't listen. Technically well made but not a desirable place to live or watch for that matter. Score: 2 / 10",Dante's Peak
18,FlashCallahan,Premature eruption......,6,19 May 2016,"USGS scientist Harry Dalton is sent to the small town of Dante's Peak to check on unusual activity. Spurred by the volcano related death of his previous love, Dalton urges Mayor Rachel Wando to put the city on alert. Dalton's boss arrives and countermands Dalton demanding scientific proof. When the proof finally arrives, Harry and Rachel must go to the volcano to rescue her two children and ex-mother-in-law. Danger arises as they try to reach safety while the town below is destroyed......It's your atypical disaster movie, but not like the ones that were more famous in the seventies like The Towering Inferno and Earthquake, it's more like the ones that were made on the tail end of the success of those films.This one feels more like Meteor, or that one with half the cast of Inferno in it, about a hotel near a volcano.And it starts as it means to go on, completely stupidly, but not having one inch of tongue in cheek about it whatsoever. And for this, it's unintentionally hilarious right from the moment a random piece of rock fall through Dalton's truck and kills his girlfriend....Flash forward a few years, and once the most aggressive push ups ever committed to screen are finished, it's back to your standard disaster movie of Dalton warning everyone, everyone doubting him, apart from Sarah Connor, who is falling for him.After all, if you can't find a Terminator, I'm sure Bond would suffice.As it goes, it's nothing really special it's The Deep impact to Volcanos Armageddon, it tries to be too serious, but when we have boiling bodies in hot springs, a woman pushing a boat through acidic water, and the funniest use of a Wilhelm scream ever, you cannot take the film for it is trying to be.Plus, the young boy will have you thinking its Joseph Gordon Levitt for the most part.Brosnan and Hamilton make it more classier than it should be, but I'll always go back to Tommy Lee Jones.After all, The Coast is Toast.",Dante's Peak
19,Aaron1375,Good disaster movie.,8,28 February 2003,"I liked this one more than Twister, which came out the year prior to this one even though Twister vastly out grossed this one at the box office.  This is the typical something bad is going to happen, someone tries to warn the people, and nobody believes till it is too late.  Still though it works really well hear as Pierce Bronson plays the guy who knows the mountain is going to blow at anytime and Linda Hamilton plays I think the mayor of the town, but I can't quite remember.  Two kids get fried in a spring, and this is what makes Bronson sure the mountain is ready to blow.  His team comes and they monitor the situation, but are not as convinced as Bronson.  They finally get the evidence, but by the time they do...BOOOOOOOOM!  Everybody goes berserk trying to get out of town and Bronson and Hamilton have to go after Hamilton's kids who just have to get their stubborn grandmother who refuses to leave.  More realistic than was Volcano, which was released the same year, it nonetheless has some flaws as well.  This volcano is the type Mount St Helens was and I don't believe these types spew lava, but this one does.  There is other stuff as well, but it isn't anything to detract from the movie.",Dante's Peak
20,Wuchakk,What was it like to be near Mt. St. Helens when she erupted?,7,10 March 2014,"1997 delivered two volcano movies, ""Dante's Peak"" and ""Volcano."" The latter film stars Tommy Lee Jones and takes place in Los Angeles. Volcanic activity in Los Angeles? They might as well have had the story take place in Ohio! Needless to say, the idea never tripped my trigger. ""Dante's Peak,"" however, has piqued my interest over the years. I've seen a couple clips of the film while channel surfing and each time I was drawn into the storyline. One clip I saw showed a skinny dipping couple in a hot spring suddenly get boiled to death because of the volcanic activity of the mountain. Another clip showed a handful of people trying to escape the volcano in a boat on a lake. The lake had become acidic because of the volcanic pangs of the mountain and all the fish were dead and the propeller on the boat melted away. These scenes convinced me that the film was worth catching some day.THE PLOT: A scenic Washington town at the foot of a mountain is celebrating being nominated one of America's best small towns. Meanwhile a scientist from the U.S. Geological Survey (Pierce Brosnan) sniffs around the massive peak and becomes convinced the Volcano is going to blow at any minute. The rest of the scientific team comes to town to investigate while Brosnan develops a relationship with the mayor (Linda Hamilton). Brosnan wants to put the town on immediate alert while the boss vulcanologist doesn't want to jump to conclusions and disrupt the town's economic interests. The volcano blows, of course.As you can see, the plot rips off ""Jaws,"" trading a Volcano for the shark, but it's effective. The thing about ""Dante's Peak"" is that IT'S BASED ON REAL-LIFE EVENTS. On May 18, 1980, Mt. St. Helens in Washington blew her top. Although there was no decent sized town nearby, 57 people were killed and 250 homes, 47 bridges, 185 miles of highway, 15 miles of railway and hundreds of miles of forestry were obliterated. The eruption caused a massive debris avalanche, reducing the elevation of the mountain's summit from 9,677 feet to 8,365 feet and replacing it with a mile-wide horseshoe-shaped crater. Mt. St. Helens is even mentioned in the picture a few times.WHAT WORKS: The cast is likable even though they do dumb things or react in a stupid fashion, e.g. the grandma who insists on staying on her mountain because it would never harm her (aduh). I always thought Brosnan was too dour as James Bond, but he's more likable and human here, albeit still serious. Anyway, I like the way the film takes its time to let us get to know the characters before disaster strikes. This works because, in the meantime, anticipation of the eruption slowly builds.I've read quite a few of the Amazon reviews and was surprised that no one had commented on the scenic locations. The town scenes were filmed in Wallace, Idaho. This quaint village sits at the foot of a big hill (we'd call it a mountain in the East), which was digitally enhanced to appear as a volcano in the film. I tell you what, they fooled me 'cause it sure looks like a real volcano. Anyway, the shots on the mountain and in the crater were filmed at none other than Mt. St. Helens, Washington (my brother incidentally lives a mere 50 miles north of there in Yelm but has mysteriously never climbed the volcano -- WIMP!).The F/X are outstanding. They used both miniatures and CGI. The volcano doesn't fully erupt until the last half hour of the film's 1 hour and 50 minutes runtime.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: Some of the dialogue and acting is lame here and there and I find the idea of a truck driving through lava to be unbelievable -- it sure took a long time for the tires to blow -- but, then again, I don't really know how long thick truck tires would last under those conditions. Lastly, they could've done better with the women (e.g. the hot spring girl, etc.), although Linda's always likable.BOTTOM LINE: Want to see what it might have been like to be near Mt. St. Helens when she blew her top? ""Dante's Peak"" is the next best thing to being there. It's one of the better disaster flicks.GRADE: B+",Dante's Peak
21,whpratt1,Pierce & Linda Gave a Great Performance,6,8 January 2006,"Decided to view this picture only because Pierce Brosnan was starring in the film and greatly enjoyed his acting skills besides his appearing as James Bond. Pierce Brosnan,(Harry Dalton),""The Matador"",'05, has a bad experience with the death of his wife during a volcano eruption and stayed in his profession as a geologist. Harry discovers from his charts that their could very well be another volcano problem effecting a small popular town. Linda Hamilton,(Rachel Wando),""The Kid & I "",'05 is the mayor and store owner of this town, who has a boy and a girl and is divorced. A romantic spark happens between Linda and Harry and the story develops into a monster of a tale. There is plenty of good action and it really keeps you on the edge of your seats. Pierce & Linda gave outstanding performances and the photography was great through out the entire picture. Very Entertaining",Dante's Peak
22,elo-equipamentos,Worst plot is a really a true disaster!!,5,25 July 2018,"Apart all scientific terms used by the crew member of institute of geologic survey is quite sure technically right, all special effects are great but when the pickup driven by Brosnan overcame a track of hot volcanic lava crossing the road, plus a little boy around 11 years old driving a van in dangerous road try to saves his grandmother, plus in the poisoned lake scene, plus saving the dog on the road and finally reaching the old mine where the car is almost crushed by heavy rock is certainly to misuse our capacity of faces such absurd facts, this is outrage with the audience!!!

23,JamesHitchcock,A sermon against the sin of avarice,6,4 August 2008,"It is sometimes said of London buses that you can wait ages for one and then two come along at once. So it is with films about volcanoes. Although there had been earlier films such as ""The Last Days of Pompeii"" and ""Krakatoa- East of Java"", both based on real disasters, volcanic eruptions were one form of catastrophe omitted from the great disaster movie cycle of the seventies. After a lull in the eighties, there was something of a revival of the genre in the nineties, and 1997 saw two volcanic films, ""Dante's Peak"" and ""Volcano"". Whereas the latter film describes a volcano which (improbably) appears from nowhere in downtown Los Angeles, the former is set in the Cascade Mountains of Washington State and is based in the real-life eruption of Mount Saint Helens in 1980.""Dante's Peak"" is the name not only of a fictitious volcano but also of the small town that nestles at its foot. The name is an obvious allusion to the Italian poet Dante Alighieri; although he also wrote about ""Purgatorio"" and ""Paradiso"", he is the man who gave the English language the word ""Inferno"". His name has become associated in the popular imagination with all things hellish; I doubt if the adjective ""Dantean"" would ever be used to describe anything heavenly.At the beginning of the film, however, Dante's Peak does seem a heavenly place to live. It is surrounded by beautiful mountain scenery, has recently been voted the second-best place to live in the USA and the neighbouring volcano has long been dormant. Reports of increased levels of volcanic activity, however, mean that Harry Dalton, a scientist with the US geological survey, is sent to investigate. (Dalton is played by Pierce Brosnan, who was the current James Bond in 1997. Is it a coincidence that he shares his surname with Brosnan's predecessor in the role?) Dalton concludes that there is a high risk of a volcanic eruption in the near future, and advises that the town be evacuated.Disaster movies often incorporate a sermon against the sin of avarice; the disaster must be seen to have been caused by, or at least exacerbated by, human greed. Thus the fire in ""The Towering Inferno"" breaks out because a sub-contractor has tried to cut costs by using substandard wiring, initial warnings about the shark in ""Jaws"" are ignored because local vested interests do not want to frighten away the tourists and the collision with the iceberg in ""Titanic"" occurs because the ship's owners, for commercial reasons, have ordered the captain to steam at full speed through the ice-field. Similarly, Dalton's warning falls on deaf ears because the Town Council of Dante's Peak are worried that any reports of volcanic activity in the area will frighten away not only tourism but also business investment.More surprisingly, Dalton's warning is ignored not only by self-interested local politicians but by his own superior Dr Dreyfus, the sort of scientist who values public relations more highly than public safety, who reassures the local residents that they have nothing to worry about. Of course, in films of this nature the prophet of doom is never believed but always proved right (the prototype of this figure seems to have been Cassandra in Homer's ""Iliad""). In another moralising touch the false comforter Dreyfus is one of those killed by the eruption. (The first victims are a young couple who sneak off to a hot pool for some alfresco sex, only to be scalded to death when the temperature of the water suddenly shoots up. In ""The Towering Inferno"" a couple having an extra-marital affair are among the first victims of the fire, which suggests that the makers of disaster films like to preach against lust as well as avarice).In common with a number of disaster movies, ""Dante's Peak"" falls naturally into two acts, (although here there is also a prelude in which we see an earlier eruption which killed Dalton's girlfriend, and fellow-vulcanologist, Marian). Act I allows the Cassandra-figure to issue his warnings and also sets the human background to the disaster by giving us a select group of characters with whom we can identify. In this case they are Dalton himself, Rachel, the divorced female mayor of the town with whom he becomes romantically involved, her two young children, and Ruth, the feisty but stubborn mother of Rachel's ex-husband. Act II deals with the disaster itself, the main source of drama being whether or not the select group will be able to escape with their lives.The scenes of the volcanic eruption are well done, but as with many disaster movies the special effects mean that the human stars tend to fade into the background. Brosnan is the best-known star here, but I felt he came across as too cool and laid back, not showing much emotion even when talking about Marian's death. This style of acting works well in the highly-stylised Bond films, but disaster movies require something a bit more naturalistic. I felt that Act I was too drawn out and that the actual eruption could have started earlier in the proceedings. Just as the real star of ""Titanic"" is the ship and the real star of ""Towering Inferno"" is the fire, so the real star here- the part that viewers will watch the film for- is the massive fireworks display in Act II. ""Dante's Peak"" is not the greatest disaster film, and has a few scientific inaccuracies, but at least it is considerably better than ""Volcano"", which frequently managed to stretch credibility past breaking-point. 6/10",Dante's Peak
24,DKosty123,Almost Got Them Again,4,2 March 2008,"Pierce Brosnan & Linda Hamilton make an appealing leading couple. Somehow this movie uncouples though. From the director of other bombs like Cocktail, this film is more in the disaster film genre than anything else.The trouble is, it is much too cliché in this genre. Having our top stars escaping from one narrow miss after another gets just too trite to believe. There are some major problems with continuity in some stretches in particular with a freeway which suddenly appears in the town area when the volcano erupts.There are some other points where the likelihood of occurrences seems really stretched. Dante's Peak proves that the disaster film genre has gotten too old & tired. This exercise is only for those fans of Brosnan & Hamilton. Others would be advised to stay away from this movie.",Dante's Peak
25,sddavis63,It's OK As Disaster Movies Go - No More Than That,5,16 April 2018,"What you get from ""Dante's Peak"" is a pretty typical disaster movie that adds little to that broad ""genre."" Dante's Peak is a little town in the state of Washington that's nestled against a mountain. It's celebrating the fact that it's been named the ""Second Best Place to Live In The United States With A Population Under 20,000."" They'll need a huge plaque for the town hall just to get all the words on it. Well, actually they won't. Because there's not going to be a town hall - or a town - for much longer. It turns out that the mountain is a volcano that's getting ready to blow its top.The main characters are Harry Dalton (Pierce Brosnan) - a geologist with the US Geological Survey who realizes that the mountains about to explode - and Rachel Wando (Linda Hamilton) - the mayor of the town. The big question is whether to prepare the town for evacuation. There's just been a company that's made a huge investment, and evacuating because of a potential volcanic eruption won't look very good. Profits before safety, you know - kind of like ""Jaws"" and other movies. The movie pushes the typical buttons. Rachel has a couple of kids who do something stupid and have to be saved and an ornery mother in law who won't take advice and there's a cute dog too. I was actually more worried about poor Roughy than anyone else in this.Special effects were OK. Performances were OK. Story was typical for a disaster film, although it seemed a little bit long. It's not better or worse than most of them. I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to watch it, but it works if you have some time to kill. (5/10)",Dante's Peak
26,thesar-2,At Its Peak,7,1 December 2012,"Okay, I'm a sucker for disaster movies. Of course, for me to watch more than once they need at least the following: decent acting, story, heart and definitely good special effects to make me believe not only that I am there, but that there's an imminent threat presented. Dante's Peak really fits the bill. Perfect? By all means, no, and I don't think Brosnan, Hamilton or Director Donaldson would disagree. They all set out to show a film of heart, with a backdrop of a natural disaster, in this case, an erupting volcano. Sure, it's not original; Dante's Peak solely takes from Twister and even Jaws. And it seems like, similar to Jurassic Park, they had the technology, why not create a definite volcano disaster flick. Giving the Brosnan volcanologist a bit of a background, he loses his girl in a separate volcano incident four years prior. And now he may be jumping the gun in the quiet, 2nd best town of Dante's Peak by saying their sleepy volcano's about to blow. Obviously, the story (and events that follow) is predictable, but that's the fun in going into a film like this. The first half of the film is filmed with gorgeous mountain scenes and a great looking town. The second half is what people bought tickets (or rented) for: a roller coaster of action, suspense and touching moments, though mostly forced. Hamilton and Brosnan save the movie with their believable, though clichéd and predictable characters. And some scenes, you'll just have to suspend that disbelief: seriously, not only is he going to attempt to drive over lava, but put everyone else and the leaping dog at risk? Still, it's enjoyable, the special effects are outstanding and with the lights out, it's a real fun (and hot) ride.",Dante's Peak

Checking out unusual seismic activities in and around the town of Dante's Peak voted to be the second most desirable place to live in the United State, you stop and wonder what the first was, Dalton gets very cozy with the town mayor as well as owner of it's popular coffee shop & bar restaurant Rachel Wando,Linda Hamilton, who's now in a desperate re-election campaign for mayor.Before the two Dalton & Rachel can get anything going romantically between them things start to cook up and look bad for the town of Dante's Peak with two young teenage backpackers found bear-a** naked floating in a nearby pound steamed or cooked to death! Dalton now certain that the doormat volcano outside town is about to blow its top he's in fact prevented from evacuating the townspeople in order not to create a panic as well as force, by the people checking out of town by the thousands, a disastrous drop in real estate prices! It's in fact Dalton's boss head Vulcanologist Paul Dreyfus, Charles Hallahan, who keeps him from doing his job in not wanting to offend the town fathers and causing them to, by showing how dangerous a place like Dante's Peak is, have their town taken off the #2 slot as the most desirable place to live in the entire United States!***SPOILERS*** As you would have expected in this disaster movie a deserter does happen in the last 45 or so minutes of the film and it's a real LuLu!

Together with hundreds of it's feeling, in trains planes helicopters and automobiles, inhabitants in boiling streams of hot lava and a deadly cloud of volcanic ash. As for Dalton's boss Paul Dreyfus he gets it and gets it good when he's swept away from off a bridge, that his SUV got stuck on, out to sea by a tidal wave that the exploding volcano created! It really the special effects that are the real star in the movie in some cases, especially at night,that give it an almost 3-D like look. As for Dalton he together with Rachel and her two kids Lauren & Graham, Jamie Renee smith & Jeremy Foley, and the family dog Roughy do survive the carnage. But it's Rachel's ex-mother-in-law Ruth, Elizabeth Hoffman, who doesn't.

28,FeastMode,sarah conner and james bond vs a volcano,7,26 June 2020,"I loved this movie when it came out. i was 12 and a giant volcano eruption is exactly what i wanted in my life. decided to give it another try, expecting it to be completely outdated and hoping it wouldn't suck too bad, or if it did suck, at least suck in a funny way.turns out, this movie is REALLY AWESOME. words to describe it: intense, suspenseful, action-packed, epic, SCARY? i was so impressed. with the exception of a couple of cheesy moments, this movie didn't feel old at all. it avoided most OMA (old movie attributes). it sidestepped cliches.most impressively, i looked SOOOO GOOD. everything looked real. there was no terrible CGI, or scenes where they don't really show you much because they can't. they showed A LOT. and it was to the point where i didn't understand if i was watching CGI or practical effects somehow stitched into the shot. whatever they did, well-done. i didn't feel that it was limited by the technology of its time AT ALL.two things this movie did amazingly that so many other disaster movies fail at. (1) the build-up wasn't boring. it was interesting and i didn't get impatient waiting for stuff to happen. (2) it gave me the feeling, multiple times, of ""omg, it's about to hit the fan."" i LOVE that feeling. i actually said omg out loud more than once.i got goosebumps multiple times during this movie. they did a great job of investing you in the characters. there were so many scenes when i was at the edge of my seat. and it was pretty brutal, especially for a pg-13 movie. they somehow inserted every possible dangerous scenario you can think of. i was yelling at the screen a couple times, like ""run! get out of there! hurry!"" i don't normally do that lol.i strongly considered giving this movie an 8. the things that held me back were the couple cheesy moments, and a few far-fetched parts that made me think some of this is probably scientifically inaccurate. and i didn't think it was on the level of my other 8's. but i'm definitely planning on watching it again, so we will see then if it still hits me as hard when my expectations aren't super low.one last thing, i watched volcano again a while ago, same situation, love it when it came out, gave it another chance expecting it to suck. i gave that a 2/10. it was awful, not suspenseful, i didn't care about the characters, nothing was believable, and it wasn't entertaining. not even so bad it's funny. it's basically the opposite of this movie, and there should be no debate about which is better. and can't even remember, was there even a volcano in volcano? rofl. the volcano in dante's peak is a big part of what made the movie so awesome.

29,g-bodyl,Good For What It Is!,8,30 July 2014,"Dante's Peak is a good, special-effects laden film even if it is a conventional disaster film. What I mean by that is that the film strictly adheres to the disaster film code, thus making the film extremely predictable. That being said, I couldn't help but enjoy myself for the most part. There is lots of action thanks to an erupting volcano and I actually felt for our main characters despite being somewhat one-dimensional.Roger Donaldson's film starts off when we see a volcanologist named Dr. Harry Dalton who loses his wife thanks to an erupting volcano in Colombia. Four years later, he is sent to a town named Dante's Peak where he is investigating possible volcanic activity with the help of the mayor, Rachel Wando. But as the movie progresses, we find that there is just more than volcanic activity....The actors here give their best shot in playing their characters. I felt for the characters as they faced the wrath of the volcano, but I couldn't buy into the eventual romance between Rachel and Harry. Pierce Brosnan was pretty good as Harry Dalton as the subdued man with a tragic past. Linda Hamilton was decent as Rachel, though she is a long way from her Terminator days.Overall, Dante's Peak is your average disaster film that is very formulaic, but still entertaining. I mean, who can't resist the molten ash and the pyro cloud causing destruction. There are some flat characters, but the action is superb. This is one of the films that brought back the disaster film craze in the late 90's. I couldn't help but like this film. I rate this film 8/10.",Dante's Peak
30,CuriosityKilledShawn,Enjoy the fireworks.,7,16 July 2007,"The 'old-fashioned' disaster movie scenario enjoyed a brief resurgence in the latter half of the 90s. After the success of Twister and ID4, films like Hard Rain, Titanic, Armageddon and Deep Impact followed in its wake. Like the two competing asteroid movies, Dante's Peak was in competition with the imaginatively named Volcano as THE Lava flow of 1997. Which one is better? Well, comparing the two is like comparing an atomic blast to a popping pimple.Pierce Brosnan is Harry Dalton, a Vulcanologist (or James Bond in disguise if you want) who predicts a major eruption in the quaint Pacific-Northwestern town of Dante's Peak. No one wants to listen to him since the town has just been named the 2nd most desirable place to live in America and is in the early stages of a thriving economy. It's the politics from Jaws all over again. Despite being shouted down by his superiors, Harry sticks around to keep his eye on the imposing mountain and woo Mayor Wando (Linda Hamilton), who is the only one who believes the 4000-year dormant volcano might blow its top.If you've seen one disaster movie, you've seen 'em all in terms of character importance. Yes, it's bloody obvious who is going to die, some of these people might as well have a death clock counting down stuck on their foreheads. And the panicking idiot mobs don't deserve anything less firey. When will nameless extras learn that following the crowd isn't the best way? I guess this is the weakest part of Dante's Peak, it never really distances itself from that single, eternal cliché of disaster films.But the film is really nothing but a showcase for special effects and it does them surprisingly well. Made before the extreme popularity of CGI, Dante's Peak has a lot of real-life destruction, in-camera effects and stunt-work. Yes, there is a fair bit of CGI and for a 10-year-old film they still hold up really well. All Volano (Zzzz...) had to offer was a very, very slight lava flow and an unintentionally hilarious scene with a melting man but with Dante's Peak we get earthquakes, boiled skinny dippers, lakes of acid, ash blizzards that create a unique atmosphere, thunder and lightning, red hot boulders raining down from the sky, mudslides, lava (of course), a massive pyroclastic cloud and lots of deep, deep bass sound effects.It's not a life-changing film by any means, but as disaster movies go it's one of the best, has an occasionally spooky score and entertains really well despite Brosnan taking it all so seriously. I would have given it a higher rating if they killed the dog (more original) and deleted the annoying Grant Heslov's utterly pointless character.",Dante's Peak
31,ironhorse_iv,This movie is a blast to watch!,6,4 September 2014,"Rising from the ashes of the 1990s, comes a great underrated disaster movie call Dante's Peak. Directed by Roger Donaldson, Dante's Peak is a movie about a volcano set in the Pacific Northwest named, obviously, Dante's Peak that's ready to erupt. United States Geological Survey Vulcanologist Dr. Harry Dalton (Pierce Brosnan) is sent to the area to check out the volcano; only to find that, the volcano will end up erupting sooner than later. With the Mayor Rachel Wando (Linda Hamilton), he tries to send the town on alert, only to be shut down by his superior, because the town happens to be second place in the 'most desirable small town to live in the US' list, and they don't want any negative accusations to threaten the town economy. Like Harry predict, the volcano erupts, leaving everybody struggling to survive. Now Harry Dalton and Rachel must journey through ashes and lava to find their kids, and exit the town before it's become too late for them. In my opinion, this movie is a lot better than the similar movie that came out, the same year in Mick Jackson's Volcano. This movie didn't made ash of itself. A lot more realistic and scientifically accurate in tone, that makes this film even more frighten than the fake looking cartoony, Tommy Lee Jones's film. Although the makers of this film, did embellish a little on volcano type logic like having characters able to breath despite Volcanic ash falling on them and outrunning the 700 km/h pyroclastic flow for the sake of the action. You really have to suspension of disbelief to enjoy this movie. Others suspension of disbelief scenes, like the driving on hot lava-crossing sequence was really film with stunt men driving over real lava, based on the film commentary. Who knew, that was really possible! Some geologists say they enjoy this movie because they get to see volcanologists in the field and some factual science did go along with the explosions. The film still holds up, as the effects were fantastic at the time. You would think the movie had a lot of CGI, but it's only specifically used for the lava. Majority of the film's visual effects were done either practically, or with very large miniatures, such as the bridge sequence, the dam burst, and even the mountain was a model. The pyroclastic flow was particularly impressive. I love how they use real new footage of the erupting of Mount St. Helens of 1980, and use it for this film. The pacing in the film is great. Dante's had a ton of build up with the threat exposed in the last arc that never really felt like it paid off to me. I didn't like any of the characters from Dante's Peak, besides the Volcanologists crew and Pierce Brosnan. No town folks was worth caring about, not the greedy businessman, or the helicopter pilot as they did a lot of things that would win a Darwin award in stupidity. But the worst had to be Grandma Ruth (Elizabeth Hoffman) who does the most stupid things to get the plot going. Mostly, the whole Grandma heroic sacrifice and rescue was kinda was pointless when you think about it. Pierce Brosnan was great as the cliché main scientist protagonist. Still, it's hard not to think of him as James Bond in this film. He kinda plays it off that way in the action scenes. He's seem less like a scientist, and more like action star. I wish, maybe he could put more drive to separate himself from his James Bond counterpart. Linda Hamilton really get underplay as the person with the most lowbrow level of character development. Honestly, you could put anybody in this role. While, she was in the film, she doesn't stand out as the Mayor. For a mayor, she really doesn't have that much power in the film. She went from being a believable bad ass woman that beat all evil comers in 1991's Terminator 2 to near useless below par character that Pierce Brosnan's character has to save. It's so embarrassing. The children actors are alright. Yes, they can be annoying at times, but I didn't mind them as much as other children character in disaster movies. Overall: It's the best Volcano movie that I saw, so far, so I lava this movie! It's an explosive treat, worth the time watching!",Dante's Peak
32,The-Sarkologist,A typical disaster movie where the Volcano is the bad guy,4,17 December 2011,"This is a disaster movie with no real plot behind it. Like Titanic there is a love story, but this story is very flat and it is the volcano that dominates the scene and not the romance. It is the volcano that tries to pull the lovers apart and even then they just appear to be more of a couple of kids who really like each other than true lovers.The focus of the movie is the destruction caused by the volcano. Though we know that the volcano is going to erupt, it wouldn't be a movie if it didn't, we are kept waiting by watching the volcanoes throes. The experts say that what is happening happens with volcanoes and doesn't mean that they will erupt. It is the huge flows of lava, the destruction of the city, and the many explosions, that keep us interested. Rachel Wando (Linda Hamilton) is only in the movie to give the hero, Harry Dalton (Pierce Brosnan, whom I think plays a reasonable scientist) a heroine to rescue.The scientist is the hero in this movie. The main reason is because he knows what is going on. He has been around volcanoes before, and has even been around them when they were erupting. He is a bit of an action hero, but he is not the ex-commando that one would expect to dominate the action movie. In fact there is not ex-commando that plays a part in the movie, only scientists. Even though this wouldn't be out of place, I find it better that it is the scientist who is the hero for it, to me, is not unreasonable. Back in the 18th Century, the scientist was the hero as he was going into the unknown. The discoveries were what made men, and still do to an extent, and it is good that the scientist still receives the recognition that he should.Self sacrifice plays a little part in this movie when Ruth (Elizabeth Hoffman) throws herself into a lake of acid to push the boat to shore. One may question about the possibility of a lake of acid and using my limited knowledge of chemistry, I can say that it is possible. Harry, when he first arrives at Dante's Peak, tests the acidity of the lakes on the volcano. This is because volcanoes produce sulphur dioxide (SO2). When sulphur dioxide comes in contact with water (H2O) it creates sulphuric acid (H2 SO4).Dante's Peak is good for a disaster movie, though there is nothing much new in it. I enjoyed the movie but won't buy it.",Dante's Peak
33,paulclaassen,Still one of my favorite disaster films.,7,14 February 2019,"More than two decades later, this is still one of my favorite disaster films, and my all-time favorite volcano movie. The visual effects are sensational - even by today's standards.The film grips you from the opening and never lets go. The suspense remains throughout. The characters are believable and likable, and the chemistry between Linda Hamilton and Pierce Brosnan was really good. As with all disaster movies, there are a few cliched moments, but it was still exhilarating and top notch entertainment. This is an all round excellent production and a classic in the disaster genre.",Dante's Peak
34,filipemanuelneto,One of the best disaster movies of the late Nineties.,6,15 August 2019,"Disaster movies can be a fun way to spend some time idle, although most are not particularly cinematically remarkable. This movie fits that description well. The action takes place in a small rural village that has just been considered a great place to live in the US, but lives in the shadow of a sleeping volcano. What no one knows is that this volcano appears to be in full swing and threatens to explode.The movie quickly creates tension among the audience, and it serves well to grab our attention. I am not the best person to judge the script's ability to be true to the scientific facts underlying a volcanic eruption, I just accept what I saw tacitly, but I admit the possibility the film is not very true to science. The initial half is slower and the action is concentrated on the final half, which is basically a race to escape the volcano. There are some loose ends and inconsistent details, like that scene where a girl, who doesn't even reach the car's pedals, can drive off in a 4-4 jeep.Pierce Brosnan was convincing in his starring role, while Linda Hamilton made an effort but is always in his shadow. Either way, they are the ones who leverage the movie. The volcano, as it happens in such cases, is almost a character in its own right. Technically, the film was entitled to the best sound and special effects that existed in 1997... but the quick advances in film make it look old-fashioned to many today. Personally, I liked what I saw.It's not an excellent movie and it's far from being the life movie of anyone involved, it has a dubious script and unbelievable scenes where (as always happens in these movies) some characters escapes from death by a hair. But it's still one of the best disaster movies of the late 1990s, it's fun and entertains the public well.",Dante's Peak

It's laughable. It's not better than Volcano the Movie, it sucks just as bad.It sucks so bad, that they show the volcano exploding and it's the same picture every time. The destruction from the explosion isn't the problem. The pyroclastic flow isn't the problem. Lava isn't your problem.

It has an emotive plot, likable characters, spectacular f/x, and a solid plot based on realistic situations.Linda Hamilton is extremely sensual and charming this time, and that helps the audience to feel identified with the main situation. Plus, Pierce Brosnan delivers an emotional performance that will make you forget him as James Bond.The writers and producer throw some low punches at the audience like, for example, in the grandma's death. A scene that happens in the middle of the disaster and that will try to make you feel bad.But after the satisfactory ending, you will feel powerful, good, and happy for the survivors.I really enjoyed this movie and the fact that there's an active volcano in my city, it's even more interesting. Thumbs up only if you like pop-corn cinema or if you're in the mood for mindless entertainment carried on by spectacular f/x.",Dante's Peak

Ideal family entertainment, kids would love it. These disaster movies got made a lot during the nineties, when for the very first time in history they figured out how to explode buildings and mountains with digital computer effects. Before that everything had to be blown up for real, but after the new gimmick of these digital computer effects EVERY movie got digital explosions in it. Dantes Peak is from that period. Although the story is 100% formula, Disney style, still it is a very enjoyable movie because it doesnt pretend to be a serious action movie, it is just sheer family entertainment fun. And some of those digital explosions are still pretty impresive, even nowadays.The story is about Pierce Brosnan saving a village from an exploding volcano. And guess what, he succeeds! Yes, what a thrill, lol.No swearing, no nudity, no violence. Only granny dies, but she was old anyways. And the dog lives! And the rest of the family lives happily ever after...",Dante's Peak

However, if you're looking for realism, action, and fast-paced well written story, Dante's Peak is the movie for you! Linda Hamilton and Pierce Brosnan deliver excellent top row performances here. The scenery is beautiful, the effects are stunningly believable, the direction was astounding, and the whole production is even better than the sum of its parts.Dante's Peak is far better than the sum of its wonderful parts; it is a riveting visual experience and a compellingly executed premise.It rates an 8.9/10 from...the Fiend :.",Dante's Peak
39,bsmith5552,Awesome Special Effects,7,3 September 2001,"""Dante's Peak"" is a disaster movie about a long dormant volcano showing signs of eruption thereby threatening to destroy the small town of Dante's Peak and all therein. Volcano expert Pierce Brosnan is sent to the town to evaluate the situation. There he meets single mom Linda Hamilton, who also happens to be the mayor of the town. As in all such movies, no one believes that the volcano will actually erupt BUT, you know what will eventually happen. The real star of this movie and what sets it apart from other similar films are its awesome special effects. Through the expert use of miniatures, computer animation et al, you really experience what it must be like to live through such a disaster. Buildings and freeways collapse, red hot lava flows everywhere, volcanic ash rains down upon the town and explosions abound. The actors merely serve as window dressing until the film's climax. Brosnan and Hamilton do the best they can with limited roles. Charles Hallahan as Brosnan's boss is excellent. Watch his expression of hopelessness and fear as he is swept away during the disaster. This film also has the requisite pair of kids (Jamie Renee Smith and Jeremy Foley) who cause their mother (Hamilton) additional worries when they try to rescue ex mother-in-law Elizabeth Hoffman when she refuses to come down from her isolated cabin to safety. Although the story is very predicable, ""Dante's Peak"" is worth a viewing if only to experience the aforementioned F/X.",Dante's Peak
40,CubsandCulture,Typifies a time and place in American culture,7,11 November 2019,"In the 90's there was a resurgence of disaster films. They always seemed to come in sets of 2. I.e. Deep Impact and Armageddon. 20 years ago Dante's Peak competed with Volcano for attention and I only saw the latter back then. On a lark I decided to finally watch this one yesterday. The movie itself is pretty terrible. The characters are stupid, the situations contrived and boy does the dialog suck. The special effects are very dated. The model work especially looks fake. But for all that this movie is a enjoyable ride.A lot of it has to do with just how 90's the film feels. Everything about this film-from the music selection, the special effects, to the story beats-screams 90's and if you lived through that time this film is a trip.For goodness sake Linda Hamilton plays a single mom who owns a business AND is the mayor of the 2nd most successful small town in America. I almost think this should be in the Criterion Collection given how typical it s of 90's pop corn film making.",Dante's Peak
41,Lechuguilla,Disaster Film? Or Film Disaster?,3,9 January 2005,"Near a picturesque little town in the American West, an inactive volcano decides to become hyper active. And, as you would expect for a disaster movie, chaos ensues.The film's first half acquaints viewers with the two main characters, played by Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton. We also get introduced to the town, and get a tour of its main attraction, the photogenic mountain that is about to wake up. The second half is the chaos.For people who like action films, ""Dante's Peak"" is a fairly good choice. The visuals, the sound, and the special effects are reasonably engaging. There's lots of exciting drama, and the film's second half is fast paced.But, if you are looking for a credible story, go elsewhere. The formulaic screenplay is bland and unimaginative; and, it is full of cinematic clichés. Of course, that is a problem with most films in the disaster genre. The stories and plot elements are basically the same, just different disaster: tornado, burning skyscraper, sinking ship, earthquake, or (in this case) volcano. I would not say ""Dante's Peak"" is a film disaster. But, its screenplay is so cookie-cutter as to be a virtual clone of every disaster film that has gone before it.",Dante's Peak

The best part of the movie is that it doesn't wastes much time in plot development.Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton both are seasoned actors and it shows in their performance. Rest of the actors were also good.The screenplay is good but the pace is uneven as either it gets fast or gets slow.

He comes to a small Washington town to warn the residents and it's beautiful mayor Linda Hamilton of an impending eruption. The residents however are in a disaster movie and reluctant to evacuate until its too late.Fantastic scenes after the initial eruption with an ash storm that looked very real. The sequence with the bridge being washed away is exciting, the lake that turns to acid, poor Grandma, the mine and subsequent Pierce getting crushed in his truck like a tin can was claustrophobia inducing, driving a truck over a lava field with the wheels on fire was far fetched but very much fun, the dog coming back out of nowhere made me cheer.

44,lukem-52760,I LOVE 90's DISASTER MOVIES & THIS IS A CLASSIC!!!,10,11 November 2020,"Dante's Peak is a fantastic, edge of the seat Disaster Thriller from the best decade that made them the 90's & this movie is definitely one of the absolute best of it's genre.
The 90's was my era of being a teenager & loving movies & we had so many excellent Disaster type flicks coming out like Stallone's Daylight & Bill Paxton's Twister & Tommy Lee Jones' Volcano & Dustin Hoffman's Outbreak & many more but DANTE'S PEAK is a MASTERPIECE of that genre in my opinion. Pierce Brosnan is brilliant as the Volcano scientist expert sent to a beautiful little all American town that happens to be very near to a huge Volcano that recently has been causing some strange behaviour around the area including the surrounding forests & rivers. Brosnan is truly excellent as our lead hero & is simply an astonishing actor & is still my favourite James Bond by far!!! Brosnan gives such a convincing & dedicated performance as Harry & i loved his nice guy character & also Linda Hamilton (Terminator 1&2) is equally fantastic as the nice natured Mayor of the town who actually wants to save everyone & is a good single parent mum to her two kids & has such nice chemistry with Brosnan on screen, they make a perfect match & both give superb performances.
Gotta talk abit about the legendary Pierce Brosnan as he was absolutely in his prime during the 90's with Classic films such as Mrs. Doubtfire, Mars Attacks & especially his big stint as the greatest JAMES BOND ever!!! His 1997 Bond outing Tomorrow Never Dies is my favourite of all the BOND franchise & no one has ever been better than Brosnan in my opinion. Brosnan always seems like such a nice guy & is in real life I've heard many times over the years & lately he stole the show as a British Mercenary in the brilliant survival Thriller NO ESCAPE with Owen Wilson, there he was more a side character but his presence made the movie feel greater & his performance was fantastic & he stole the show & that's the power of such a great performer & veteran actor. I will always have big Nostalgic love for 90's Brosnan because that was his glory days & when he starred in his best films, especially DANTE'S PEAK.The little town is beautiful & a stunning background for our Characters & the town looks so gorgeous, almost old fashioned like a 1950's all American town complete with a town hall for meetings with the townsfolk & the whole gorgeous town is surrounded by stunning forests & beautiful rivers, this is a postcard town & i loved everything about it from it's cozy Coffee Diners to it's big stunning bridge & we also have a lovely colourful Carnival happening too. The cinematography is beautiful, colourful & eye popping from the glow of Neon signs to the Bright Colourful Carnival it's all stunning to look at. The music is fantastic throughout the whole movie, perfect score. The action is so well spaced out & made exciting & threatening through superb build up & tension such as the horny couple who take a naked dip into a beautiful water hole pool within the forest & it's warm & peaceful but the scene plays out like it's a Slasher flick from the 80's as it builds up to the couple not getting sliced up but by boiling alive in the water, it's an impressive & thrilling scene to show what's slowly happening around the place. The Disaster sequences in this film are some of the greatest ever filmed in my opinion, the suspense is almost unbearable at times (The boat of the boiling acid lake) & the action is thrilling & exciting & absolutely edge of the seat stuff. Probably my favourite Disaster movie ever & this is the best I've seen Pierce Brosnan as a lead hero, he's fantastic & i loved his little team that join him with his investigations in the town & the like i said the building up of threat & danger is expertly done & explodes with action & devastation.Dante's Peak is a forgotten Gem from the 90's, a Classic Disaster movie that never gets mentioned & it's such a shame because it's a thrilling Masterpiece of a Disaster movie with excellent performances & beautiful cinematography, it's top notch filmmaking & a perfect ""Pop Corn"" movie & to me is what movies were about back then, the entertainment, fun & excitement.

47,philip_vanderveken,It has really nothing new to offer,5,21 December 2004,"Dante's Peak is based on the magic formula that Hollywood has used already so many times before for this kind of disaster movies. Apparently the studio's in Hollywood believe that we all are nothing but simple minds who don't like to watch a movie that's at least a little bit challenging.I have to admit that the graphics really look nice. The eruption of the volcano is really very well done. Even about the ""scientific"" facts and words used in the movie I will not complain, apart from some minor things like a car driving over lava without catching fire. Overall it all seems realistic and that's not always very evident in Hollywood. But the main problem that I have with the movie is that it has really nothing new to offer.A scientist is send to a marvelous, almost perfect little village to investigate a neighboring volcano that has already been dormant for thousands of years. But of course the volcano is getting active again and our beloved scientist, who's falling in love with a local beauty (the local coffee shop owner and mayor of the village), warns the authorities that a disaster will be inevitable if they don't react immediately. Of course no-one believes him and the disaster happens.We all know what happens, some people die, but our main characters will survive the horror. No, if you are looking for something new, you better switch to something else, because you'll not find it in this movie.

49,mjw2305,A Disaster Movie with Realism,7,30 December 2006,"Dante's Peak spends much of the opening half of the film building the characters and setting the scene for disaster, and it definitely helps you identify and care about the characters involved. The story concentrates mainly on Linda Hamilton who is the mayoress of Dante's Peak, along with her family; and of course on Pierce Brosnan who is sent to investigate the seismic activity in this quaint little town.The events build steadily in this movie, eventually reaching a fantastic climax that is very realistic to watch. Dante's Peak is very dramatic and has a mild dose of sentimentality that fits seamlessly into the story.Make no mistake, this movie is really well made and is very enjoyable to watch, but be warned; if you like your disaster movies done gung-ho style it may disappoint you.7/10",Dante's Peak

I couldn't see the two of them meshing well at all, but I was dead wrong. The side characters, particularly the ones who play Pierce's coworkers, are all unique in their own quirky (and sometimes infuriating) ways that sets them apart individually. I find this to be rare in movies with lots of side characters; they tend to just blend together. Not here, though.When it comes to disaster movies, though, I guess acting and interesting characters aren't the main concern for most movie fans. Seeing a disaster movie with a release date from over two decades ago can be scary, mainly because your first thought is, ""Oh, God, how awful are these effects going to look?"" Well, I can tell you that the special effects actually hold up quite well.

That doesn't stop it being unintentionally funny.Geological mystery abounds on whether the mountain shadowing bucolic tourist town Dante's Peak will erupt or not. Yuh think? Yet Pierce Brosnan wastes his overqualified suaveté as geologist Harry Dalton, sniffing for sulphur and prospective explosions, whilst himself trying to sniff and explode in the man-pants of ugly town mayor Linda Hamilton. (Is it just me or did her muscles in TERMINATOR 2 alleviate the weird face?) Pre-empting VOLCANO by a mere two months, there is more science, more drama, more romance here than in Tommy Lee Jones's bombastic vehicle. And in place of the leathered shoe-face of Jones, more Pierce - yes please! Of COURSE the mountain explodes (did I ruin it for anyone?), and all boredom breaks loose. Running and Screaming with the usual tropes: the grandmother who won't leave her mountain home, then ends up sacrificing herself for her grandkids (when she hops out of a boat into supposedly boiling water to help steer it to shore, yet looks like she's just stepped into a pool that's not heated quite right at the old folks home); Harry's geologist boss (Charles Hallahan) who disagrees with him, who is proved wrong and dies, his crew watching his van being swept away like they're watching a physics lecture; there's even a dog leaping to safety. I hate that. I hate that so much.And don't forget the spindly, delicate robot surveyor that can't even walk steadily on flat ground, sent down the 60-degree slope of the caldera, which it descends at a rate of We'll-Be-Here-Till-Christmas. Of COURSE it malfunctions halfway down, precipitating a decidedly reckless doughy geologist going ill-advisedly off-rope to fix the useless piece of crap.

55,vip_ebriega,Great special effects + Average writing = Good movie.,6,13 May 2008,"My Take: Special effects and eminent destruction salvage the disposable writing.After the success of Jan De Bont's Big-budget disaster epic TWISTER, Universal green-lit its own disaster spectacular DANTE'S PEAK, which is practically the same movie that TWISTER was, only this time, it's a dormant volcano that goes berserk, and the people are not studying the tornadoes, they study volcanoes. Not much of a differences now isn't it? DANTE'S PEAK is what it is, a big-budget summer offering, where the money is heavily spent on special effects, and the script is either out of focus or uninteresting. DANTE'S PEAK could fall to the guilty pleasures list along with all those dated 70's disaster movies, but I did like it more than a guilty pleasure. It's still average at best for sure, but it's got some fun moments with its special effects, and that's pretty good enough to recommend.Let's run through the disaster movie checklist shall we? 1.) Is there the scientist who predicts the danger and ends up being neglected at first, but ends up being the ultimate hero in the end? Yes there is, and he's played by Pierce Brosnan. The character's Harry Dalton, a vulcanologist joining his crew studying the ""extinct"" volcano at Dante's Peak. Brosnan's a good actor and pulls off the role easily, but the character's not very interesting enough. At the end of the film, you'll end asking ""Who was he again... Harry who?"" 2.) Is there the guy who doubts the leads warnings? You betcha! He's Paul Dreyfus (Charles Hallahan), Dalton's boss, who thinks Harry's just nuts! Besides the fact that he does learn his mistake in the end, there's nothing more this character does. 3.) Are there the supporting characters including the leading lady, the annoying kid(s) and of course the dog? Why shouldn't there be? The movie's got two kids, and a dog. There's also the grandmother and experts. Linda Hamilton who gave women the ultimate credibility in TERMINATOR 2 plays a rather feeble character here as Mayor Rachel Wando, mayor and love interest, overall a disposable summer movie character.Oh lets face it! The writing here isn't very good, but it's still a lot of fun nonetheless. Even if we don't care about these cookie-cutter characters, those action scenes (including the one where they're chased by the cascading lava flows) are pretty exciting. It's forgettable summer fare, but it does it's job. Better enjoy it for what it is.Rating: *** out of 5.",Dante's Peak
56,tbills2,"Dante's Peak, a Blast from the Past!",6,24 July 2013,"Dante's Peak is a little unknown, very fine film. Pierce Brosnan is Dr. Harry Dalton, a volcanologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, who's sent to the small town in Washington within the Northern Cascades named Dante's Peak, the second most desirable place to live in the United States population under 20,000, to check on a long time dormant volcano that's about to erupt. Linda Hamilton is Rachel Wando, the mayor of Dante's Peak, who's taken with Dr. Dalton and keeps close by. Hamilton and Brosnan have very interesting, very authentic chemistry that makes Dante's Peak more than worth while. Brosnan and Hamilton is the movie's main sight, while the volcano of Dante's Peak is the movie's main attraction. The ever-present brewing volcano provides the ominous backdrop to the storyline implanting constant tension. There's no action or effects until the volcano erupts, but when it does, there's loads of it. Dante's Peak turns into an all out action-adventure with great set effects for large scale destruction. The presentation of the special effects is very well done. The movie is good before the volcano erupts still, by having a nice, hang around vibe and pace, good not to rush things. Dante's Peak's prolonged pace is difficult to achieve, but it is executed well. The film does a solid job of incorporating the characters onto the viewing. Dante's Peak has good camera direction from the start up and through to the action-packed finish that makes for an overall great visual experience. It's a well-framed story. I don't know what all else to say other than this is a really liked film without too many complaints. I give Dante's Peak a 6 for it being so greatly appealing and such fine, family fun. I can enjoy this movie dearly again and again every so many years. I like Volcano more, from the same year, but Dante's Peak is a better movie.",Dante's Peak
57,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Hell hath no fury...,8,29 January 2009,"If ""Dante's Peak"" demonstrates anything, it is that a very simple idea CAN be done well if it is done right. Everything you needed to know about this movie is in the trailers and that is briefly summed up in the following: a volcano next to a small town erupts. Then in seeing the film you can see that the promise of destruction is fulfilled as the volcano does, in fact, erupt. All the usual clichés are here: the lead scientist has had a loss in life, is driven by it to insist on the volcano erupting, people in his team doubt him, there is slowly mounting tension and ominous evidence, etc... but in the end he ends up being more than right as the volcano erupts and, oh boy, does it ever! The result is some of the most enjoyable scenes of sheer terror and destruction to ever rampage across a movie screen.The movie takes place in one town yet the production must have been massive as the 100 million dollar plus budget suggests. Since everything is pretty much destroyed via glorious classic practical effects; buildings, cars, helicopters, trucks, bridges... in fact the volcano unleashes such a hellish fury that it's name, Dante's Peak, is very appropriate and much more thoughtful than say, ""Volcano.""The thing that usually kills a movie like this is the overdoing of effects and overdoing of plot. Depsite harrowing catastrophic destruction the effects are just enough for a movie like this, meaning when it's over no one will be disappointed or asking for seconds too quickly. Then the acting is too pretty much just right and straight to the point. Corny subplots are left out and the film, though ridiculously simple, is very focused on what it sets out to do. That is what makes it enjoyable. --- 8/10BsCDb Classification: 13+ --- terror/violence",Dante's Peak
58,rebeljenn,Ugh! Another thriller about volcanoes! Disaster!,2,13 November 2005,"'Dante's Peak' was one of the volcano disaster films that emerged in the mid/late-1990s. It's just what you would expect out of the typical thriller movie. You're introduced to the characters: typically a male and female lead who will probably get together by the end of the film, a brewing disaster usually followed through with some sort of science lesson, and a fast-paced and action-packed scenario typically involving something natural like killer snakes or dinosaurs or terrorists or volcanoes or aliens or snowstorms or tornadoes... You can pretty much make a generated storyline based on the genre. Enter number of characters, at least one male and one female. Enter natural disaster. Hit submit to get your plot.Dante's Peak is no exception to the rule. You can pretty much guess the conclusion here. Hey, if you like thrillers, see this film. If you don't like them, then don't bother. I wish I hadn't been dragged off to the cinema to see this. Talk about a waste of a few dollars...",Dante's Peak
59,tonypeacock-1,Disaster movie cliche's are all here!,6,14 November 2019,"The late 1990s was a sort of renaissance for the disaster movie. This entry in the genre focuses on an explosive volcano thought dormant near the town of Dantes Peak. An affluent U.S. town.The film from 1997 stars Pierce Brosnan fresh from his success in his debut James Bond film Goldeneye. Brosnan plays a volcanologist who suspects the imminent disaster about to befall the town when trees die from elevated sulphur levels in the soil, poor water quality and burned alive bodies in a local spring. I've never been keen on Pierce Brosnan as an actor at the best of times. To me he is still a B-list TV star from Remington Steele in the 1980s. The film also stars Linda Hamilton as the town mayor Rachel Wando. Hamilton was best known as Sarah Connor in the Terminator franchise. She does an admirable job despite some poor lines and delivery from Brosnan.The film has several classic elements from the disaster film. The relationship between Brosnan's volcanologist expert Harry Dalton and Wando forms a side-story to the main disaster to follow. Of course Wando has two cute kids and a pet dog oh and a stubborn old mother who lives further up the peak and nearer the epicentre of the ensuing eruption.The dog runs into danger and leaves the audience in suspense at it's survival chances. I wonder (sorry I know) what happens to the dog. It happens in these films all the time! As the volcano erupts the town has to rapidly evacuate. The scientists early in the film tell us how quickly the volcano erupts. Wouldn't they all die anyway? Which brings me onto another cliche of such films. The town meeting with officials where there is scepticism to the dangers!I had to laugh at some of the set pieces such as Dalton driving through molten lava in a 4x4. Wando's elderly mother sacrificing her own life. Ash falling down on the residents like snow. Wouldn't it be hot and cause lung injuries? The CGI is plausible for the period and is used to good effect. A time passer but hardly a classic. However better than fellow 1997 volcano film Volcano starring Tommy Lee Jones.",Dante's Peak

61,Movie-12,One of the worst disaster films ever created in the history of film. 1/2* out of ****.,1,28 December 1999,"DANTE'S PEAK (1996) 1/2*Starring: Pierce Brosnan, Linda Hamilton, Jamie Renee Smith, Jeremy Foley and Elizabeth Hoffman Director: Roger Donaldson   Running Time: 112 minutes   Rated PG-13 (for disaster violence and gore)By Blake French:	""Dante's Peak"" is a disaster of a disaster flick. That is a cheap joke, but the movie sure wasn't cheap to make. Massive pyrotechnics, state of the art special effects, some of the biggest names in the movie business, all contribute to one big fat number to the production cost. It is a movie with such little intelligence and emotional significance it is hard to sit through the film's overly long running time without laughing at its stupidity. This is one of the worst films I have seen in quite sometime.
	Instead of the story, lets skip right to the chase. How about starting with the flawed characters. Take for instance the grandmother, Ruth. Her character is all but a puppet of the plot. Ask yourself these questions and notice the answers are only present to place the other characters in more tension rising jeopardy: Why would Ruth refuse to leave her cottage when the town is being destroyed by volcanic material? To provide the characters with a reason to travel up the mountain to save her and put themselves in more danger. Unfortunately, the film is so stupid it cant even capture a rescue correctly. Ruth's grandchildren (10-12 years old,) take their parents vehicle, drive through the volcanic soot, and somehow manage to find their way to the cottage, yet they cant turn on the windshield wipers in the car. And lets not forget to mention the two main characters, Harry Dalton and Rachel Wando, whose personalities are instantly obvious. We know who is going to die from the beginning just judging from difficulties in personalities.	This entire production is held together by pure foolishness. Just look at the film's extreme stupidity--here are a few examples of how dumb and or desperate the writers actually get: · Harry drives his truck directly through a moderately deep river due to an overcrowding of traffic, and makes it across with few difficulties.
· The family's dog, Ruffy, disappears near the start of the volcanic eruption and somehow manages to appear out of nowhere for his heroic family rescue sequence. · Harry and crew drive through a platform of molten lava.
· The concept of the characters waiting till there's a river of red hot lava flowing through the living room of their cottage before they decide its time to run. 	""Dante's Peak""  is so bad it doesn't even offer any surprise when the volcano finally does blow its top. The film foreshadows the eruption with so many elements it is almost hard not to ask yourself why they even bothered with the production in the first place. Here are some examples of elements foreshadowing a Volcanic disaster · First of all, why would anyone make a movie about a volcano about to erupt if it wasn't going to erupt in an all out action finale filed with special effects? · Animals are dying everywhere on the mountain for unnatural reasons.· While swimming in the mountain's springs, two lovers are killed when the water dramatically heats up.· We see water boiling in the mountain.· The mountain shows strange activities while a man just so happens to be testing its activity levels.· Sulfur dioxide is found in the city's water supply.Now here is some dialogue foreshadowing the volcano's explosion:· ""This mountain means business.""· ""98% of these are false alarms.""· ""When is this mountain ready to blow."" · ""If the volcano did blow it would reach here within a minute""Of course the filmmakers couldn't resist but to throw in a romantic subplot. The following actions and or conversations all attempt to develop romantic chemistry between Brosnan and Hamilton:· Harry's and Hamilton's characters sit down in the evening and nonchalantly discuss romance in their past.· The two take a peaceful walk together in the evening while one asks the other if they can stay longer.The special effects in this picture are also quite lame. The erupting volcano looks like a still photo of something out of national geographic. We do get to see buildings fall apart and fires start, but that isn't as exciting as the scene in which Harry outruns a cloud of volcanic smoke speeding towards him-not. This may be the worst disaster film ever made, but at lest it still contains decent performances.Brought to you by Universal Pictures.",Dante's Peak

Somehow my first time watching this in its entirety, I was entertained and engaged throughout.It requires the suspension of disbelief in heavy doses, but it does what you need a disaster film to do. The special effects were quite impressive for the 90s and looked great at times in high-def.Pierce Brosnan was in top-form and really carried the film with Linda Hamilton. Some of the ""deaths"" were a bit laughable, but I think it's to be expected in films of this type. It adds to the (dare I say) fun that disaster films often are.It makes me want to visit the town of Wallace, Idaho.

64,jhaggardjr,A blast!,8,5 November 2000,"""Dante's Peak"" is a very entertaining disaster film about a volcano erupting in a small town in the Pacific Northwest. Pierce Brosnan stars as a volcanologist who goes to the town to investigate the current rumblings going on around the mountain. He gets help from Linda Hamilton who plays the town mayor. The first half of ""Dante's Peak"" is only moderately entertaining with Brosnan trying to convince his dumb-as-nails boss that this mountain means business. But the real excitement comes at the halfway mark when the volcano explodes and the special effects take over. The visual effects are very impressive in ""Dante's Peak"", which puts the terrible effects in Irwin Allen's awful 1980 flick ""When Time Ran Out"" to shame. Brosnan and Hamilton turn in very good performances here, as do the two kids who play Hamilton's children. There are a few weaknesses in ""Dante's Peak"" which keeps it from being a great movie. It's too bad not everyone turns in a good performance in this film. Charles Hallahan and Elizabeth Hoffman have the most laughable parts in the film as Brosnan's boss and Hamilton's ex-mother-in-law, respectably. They provide the dumbest dialogue in the film. And it would have been better if the eruption had happened a little earlier instead of the mid-point of the movie. A couple of scenes in the first half are a little boring. Nevertheless, there is enough good stuff in ""Dante's Peak"" (especially in the second half) that I ended up liking it in the end. It's one of the better disaster movies. *** (out of four)",Dante's Peak
65,chrisbrown6453,"If a loud special-effects display gets your heart pounding and your blood pulsing, then Dante's Peak may be just what you need.",6,21 May 2002,"Others beware. Yes, the effects (including earthquakes, floods, explosions, flaming lava flows and ashen downpours) look expensive and are generally impressive, except for some bogus miniature work, that is. The rest of Dante's Peak is the pits. Tired clichés dominate. The cookie-cutter characters are beyond dull, and the predictable plot devices are ""borrowed"" from Jaws and countless other, better disaster flicks. Dante's Peak is a picture postcard-pretty town in the Pacific Northwest that has just been voted by Money magazine the second-best place in America to live. Cash and business should come pouring in, and the citizens will be happy. Obviously, when the votes were counted, nobody mentioned the dormant volcano next door that's about to blow its top. So much for being #1 next year. Soon the locals are fleeing for their lives, and the town's big potential investor is heading south toward San Diego. This 1997 version has Pierce Brosnan (who wishes he were back in his James Bond tux, no doubt) and Linda Hamilton (who wishes she were in Terminator 3, no doubt). That's it for Dante's star sizzle. Who cares about watching anonymous actors being parboiled while skinny-dipping or having their legs eaten away by a lake turned to sulfuric acid? Wouldn't it have been more fun to watch Drew Barrymore and Matthew Perry dive into boiling water? I'm sure disaster vets like Borgnine, George Kennedy, Linda Blair, Roddy McDowall, Stella Stevens, etc. would have been thrilled to play Dante's Peakians.

72,ozthegreatat42330,Excellent Film and I will not read other reviewers.,9,3 April 2007,"I loved this film, with just one small point to nit pick. Dr. Harry Dalton is recognized as a top expert in his field. he is even called in off vacation to go check things out. He reads the signs and tries to warn the town. And his boss, the man who recognizes that he is the leading expert, calls him on the carpet and tries to play politics with the town council. If someone told me my volcano was going to blow up in my face soon, I sure as Hell would not be worrying about the future economy at the possible expense of people's lives.There was one reviewer who said that Ruth's stubbornness was not believable. On the contrary, when you are older, and I can speak from experience, you don't want to give up your security, whatever life around you may be saying. Don't forget there were a number of people who died when Mt. St Helens blew in 1980 because they were just like Ruth.

The acting is fine. Actually, the dialog is fine. The problem really begins about 2/3 of the way through the movie when Dante's Peak blows her stack. After that, it is one implausible scene after another. And every scene as a variety of subimplausibilities. I figured it was about 1 per 15 seconds if you wanted to be picky. For the average intelligent person, 1 every 30 seconds out of sheer necessity to make sure anyone you are watching with couldn't possibly imagine that you might consider it realistic.NEVERTHELESS, I enjoyed the film. I really like Pierce Brosnan and I also really like Linda Hamilton. They were good together. The scenery is great. I liked the town. And, the build up to the climax is fairly well done.

77,grnhair2001,special effects that hold up today,7,10 May 2012,"There is a formula for disaster movies and books. An insightful scientist sees The Bad Thing is going to happen, various foils keep him from warning people (often with sillier motivation than in this film), we get to know a bunch of average Joe characters who survive or do not survive the disaster. Earthquake movies, movies about made-up natural disasters that cannot happen, asteroid movies, even some nuclear holocaust films (like The Day After, unique in how many survive). It's a hackneyed formula, but it also works, and nothing else really does work as well for disaster plots. It was followed here.The special effects were terrific in the day, and they still hold up very very well in 2012.For a Hollywood film, the science was pretty good. I actually cringed back at the shots of Hawaii type basalt floes (just...no), and the ashfall cleared up nicely whenever they wanted a wide shot, which anyone in Yakima could tell you it really doesn't do, and the boat and drive-over-lava scenes were silly, and if you paddle a boat (through acid or not) with one hand, it's not going to go straight, and our heroes didn't need to cover their mouths in ashfall (meaning, IRL, the ash would turn to concrete in their lungs and they'd suffocate). However, all that having been complained about, much else was very accurate: what gets tested for by volcanologists, what monitoring stations of the day looked like, what some of the warning signs of a coming eruption might be. Most Hollywood film reviews by me on science-based movies are nothing but a list of what they did wrong, with no ""however"" of accurate bits to follow that list, so kudos for doing it more than half right.A pleasant diversion, very pretty to look at.",Dante's Peak

LindaHamilton(Rachel) is the mayor of the town who is perplexed by this investigation.Harry is sure intuitively that the peak will explode and destroy the town fully and asks the mayor for the evacuation.He is however delayed by his Boss(Paul) who is not convinced and waits for scientific evidence.The peak finally explodes devastating the entire town. Harry,Rachel together with her two kids survives with heavy struggle towards the end.During the process Paul dies with few other people.The movie uses a good story-line and beautifully executed.The elements are well portrayed i.e all the important scientific elements necessary to make the movie meaningful is clearly portrayed.The videography is superb i.e natural disasters related elements are just finely shown.The theme of the movie is natural-disaster and it didn't lose the grip from it by showing unnecessary elements.The characters are also fine regarding to the theme.Few things which is good about the movie:The pilot of the helicopter being a greedy person is killed by the disasters and that is good portrayal.
The elements of optimism is high and are very finely portrayed.(research,team-spirit,family etc) for a movie like this.
Rachel's son playing in the mine,the ELF separated from the Robot are few edges which are well covered within the movie towards the end.(good scripting)
Pierce-Brosnan is superb as a matured-responsible person who learns from his experience.Other characters are also finely executed.
Lastly among many,the visuals of the film are just fine.I just loved them every time I watched it.There are few minus-points within the movie i.e storytelling is not serene and few lose elements like relation between Rachel and her Mother-in-law which really doesn't disturb the movie theme.Overall the movie is very fine and it will never fail to entertain its audience with learn and fun elements.As per me this is one of the best natural disasters movie ever-made.Thanks all to Ronald-Donaldson for such a film.Based upon the above mentioned points I would rate it 8 out of 10.

86,EmptyLeo,"Better than Volcano, says me",7,21 August 1999,"I really liked this movie. Once the action started the movie went non-stop. I was on the edge of my seat a number of times. Especially when Paul, I think it was Paul, got swept away with the bridge and also when they were in the boat that started to dissolve right out from under them. Pierce Brosnan was very good, I liked the guy who played Paul, I think it was Paul, and the children were good too. But I really liked Linda Hamilton in this. It's hard to watch a movie with her without thinking ""Terminator"", but I had no problem separating her from that role to this onei give this a 7/10",Dante's Peak

My problems with it are during the climax. First the WALL holds up for them just long enough for them to casually make it down the stairs upon leaving the house, then the BOAT holds up just long enough for them to make it to the DOCK which holds up just barely long enough. Finally, they crash into the MINE just barely in time, which holds up from caving in just long enough for Harry to make it back to the truck to turn the signal on. Also, at the beginning of the climax, don't keep trying, until every person's had his turn, to get a hold of the grandma. If she hung up on someone (Harry), showing how stubborn she's being, what makes them think anyone else will have any better luck? It's stupid and a waste of time. And I like how the climax is based around them going up the mountain for the stubborn grandma who doesn't even make it down with them, being dumb enough to hop into the acidic water. Lastly, the drive over the mostly- dried-up lava on the road is so much garbage. Those tires would've popped well before they made it across.",Dante's Peak

89,hhfarm-1,Awful made-for-TV tripe,3,21 August 2006,"It's the same story as Jaws which is the same story as Ibsen's 1882 ""Enemy of the People"" (Hollywood offered no thanks to Ibsen of course): the materialistic town leaders downplay disaster warnings until it's TOO LATE.This is your basic made-for-TV schlock: there's a flimsy lead-in; the hero perceives the impending disaster but no one will listen (until it's too late and he saves his love interest and her kids); the kids are precocious & say and do some startling yet endearing things; the acting is miserable throughout (even Brosnan); there are numerous relationship-building scenes; many long looks and meaningful pauses; and all the dramatic dialogue you could want.This reminds us for one thing that Linda Hamilton has 0 acting ability and incapable of anything more poignant than a strained facial expression.The lava is decent but not in enough scenes - water and the eruptive's explosion do more damage. Some clever aspects of the storyline: 1) the hero drives his 4x4 through hot lava, get's stuck and we see the truck and tires on fire (plus Linda H helps us by saying ""the truck is on fire""). But he downshifts and drives out. The truck's fire then goes out and the thumping tires then re-inflate themselves enough to outrace the volcanic explosion. 2) the only escape from the lava is via a boat across the lake. They then find a truck and drive a bit. The dog they had to leave behind manages to avoid the lava and the lake to catch up with them in time to jump into the burning truck and be saved. 3) They take a metal boat across the lake. The boat starts to smoke because the lake has become acid (as we see the boat melting Linda says ""Acid dissolves metal""). The boat smokes and leaks (""keep your feet up kids"") for many minutes but they just make it to the shore.The morals and ending are nice and tight - worthy of any Disney or Ron Howard pap: anyone who didn't believe the hero dies; the town elders and the bad guy (a helicopter pilot) really die; the hero, the kids and the dog are saved; someone almost ignores the rescue signal but then sees it just in time.Rates a 1 for storyline but has some OK special effects so we'll go with a 3.",Dante's Peak

Nevertheless, this movie with its death defying suspense tosses the audience from their seats, many a times.",Dante's Peak
91,dwr246,Volcanic eruptions aren't the only disasters in this film,3,4 April 2005,"The title contains a literary allusion to the Renaissance author of the Divine Comedy. The writers of this film have earned themselves a place in one of the circles of hell for this inaccurate, unbelievable, and ultimately uninteresting movie.Dante's Peak actually refers to a fictitious town at the foot of a dormant volcano in the cascades. The volcano begins showing potential signs of life, so the USGS sends their best man, Harry Dalton (Pierce Brosnan) to investigate the situation. Harry's been battling his own demons since his girlfriend, Marianne (Walker Brandt) was killed four years earlier during an eruption in South America. Harry meets up with the town's mayor, Rachel Wando (Linda Hamilton), and quickly has cause to believe that the volcano will erupt. He is working out an evacuation plan with the town council when his boss, Paul Dreyfuss (Charles Hallahan), arrives and puts the kibosh on the whole thing with words of wisdom about not creating a panic until they have more evidence. By the time Harry manages to convince Paul that an eruption will indeed take place, it begins before they can safely evacuate the town. To further complicate matters, Rachel's children, Lauren (Jamie Renee Smith) and Graham (Jeremy Foley), have gone off to the volcano to convince their grandmother, Ruth (Elizabeth Hoffman), that she should leave the mountain, which she stupidly and stubbornly refuses to do. Harry and Rachel race against time, lava, ash, and pyroclastic flows to save the kids and their grandmother from the evil volcano.I'm not a vulcanologist, but even as a layman, I had to question the scientific accuracy of the film to the point where I did a little research. I discovered whole websites devoted to pointing out the inaccuracies of this film. Sadly, they start in the opening scene where a lava bomb burns through the roof of the truck and lands on Marianne's head, killing her. While you would indeed die if a lava bomb landed on your head, steel has a higher melting temperature than liquid lava, and a solid piece of rock flying through the air would have cooled to the point where it couldn't burn through steel. The scene where the hikers are boiled in the hot springs is also way off base. Hot springs are a result of magma heating rocks which in turn heat the water. Unless the magma came in direct contact with the water, the water would heat gradually enough that any bather would have plenty of time to get out before getting burnt. And if the magma had come in direct contact with the water, the resulting steam explosion would have ripped away half the mountain - end of movie. Likewise, no lake would turn to acid that quickly, and even if it did, it couldn't eat through a metal boat in a matter of minutes, nor would it cause burns that severe on flesh covered in denim, which is a pretty heavy material. Lastly, a pyroclastic flow is hot gas, which will go anywhere it can get in. They couldn't have ""hidden"" from it in the mine unless they had been able to seal the entrance so that it was airtight, which would have meant they would eventually run out of air themselves. Someone didn't do much research in writing this screenplay.To further stretch our credibility, are we to believe that Harry didn't notice something coming through the roof of his truck, or smell the burning hair and flesh as his lover expired without a sound? Rachel doesn't see the faces of the hikers boiled in the hot springs, yet she claims to not recognize them (she knows every ass in town?). Apparently, swarms of earthquakes and deformation of the ground, two of the most common signs of an impending eruption, fail to convince Paul that one is about to happen, yet when Harry shows him a glass of dirty water he's convinced (I'd be worried every time they cleaned the water mains if it worked that way). Are we really to believe that two children under the age of twelve could drive a truck up a mountain while it's erupting? How do you outrun a pyroclastic flow, which can easily outdo a car, on four flat tires? And considering Harry nearly gets crushed as the mine continues to collapse, and the others don't have much food or water, how are they able to walk out of the mine with little or no ill effects? We've definitely stretched the limits of credibility beyond breaking here.Unfortunately, the acting fares little better than the writing. Neither Brosnan nor Hamilton manages to rise above the material. While they don't rate much chemistry with each other, they do at least manage to make you care about their characters, as does Hallahan, whom you route for even though you know he's doomed. Not so for Hoffman, who is irritating from her first moment on the screen until her last. Smith and Foley present two of the most annoying kids you could imagine, and in the end, you wish Harry and Rachel had simply left them all to their fate on the mountain. The USGS team is enough to make you glad you don't work with them, and their performances don't rate individual mention.The only good part of the movie was the special effects. The scene where the lava comes through Ruth's living room wall was good, and the actual explosion of the mountain was awesome. Pity you have to sit through such a bad movie to get to them.No doubt a movie which portrayed a volcanic eruption accurately could be made entertaining. Most movies tend to sacrifice accuracy for entertainment value. Unfortunately, this movie sacrificed both.",Dante's Peak

94,alicespiral,Pure escapism,10,20 March 2007,The point about this film is that to make it work as a disaster movie it was necessary to take a lot of artistic license.Like the car driving through the ruins-even a tank could have run into problems! But its what you want to see happen rather than some boring bedroom scenes which thankfully never happened. It built up slowly until the moment the water turned brown then it became riveting. Special effects are special effects whatever year they were done and looked very realistic. It was well acted without any foul language and as a video its a keeper. I take more to charity shops.

95,cheathamg,One of the best of an admittedly lame genre.,8,13 October 2003,"One of the best of an admittedly lame genre, Dante's Peak manages to overcome the unfortunate requirements placed upon it by the movie-going public's expectations of a film in which the main point in watching is to see things distroyed.  This is accomplished by placing the disaster at the very end of the movie.  The majority of the film is used to develop the characters and advance the love story.  The poignancy of the love story is intensified against a background of impending doom and the hero's demon-haunted earlier tragic love affair.  There are also some interesting sidelights in that much of the structure of the action is taken directly from Dante's Inferno.  For example, the lake of fire and the main character's ultimate escape by plunging more deeply into the heart of the inferno are from the book.  A certain amount of thought went into this one.",Dante's Peak

However VOLCANO had the bigger star, the bigger effects and the bigger budget. But I have to confess I enjoyed Brosnan's effort a lot more.The plot is as simple as it is spelled out. All the Hollywood trademarks are here, a damsel in distress, mouthy but ultimately cute kids, and a 'deep respect' for the forces of Mother Nature. There is sadly a complete lack of chemistry between the leads (Brosnan and Linda Hamilton), and one can't get the image of her tough-girl TERMINATOR role out of one's head. And why is she running a coffee-shop at the same time as running a town???The effects are disappointingly sparse, and the big scene (Brosnan+truck v Molten lava) is highly improbable to the point of spoiling.

The models are very detailed, but they are so noticeable. The railway that falls down (one piece) is a model too. So, when we notice the models, what do we have left? OK, we have a whole town going down to hell in the urgent way. We have a car crossing a lava river, while the four people inside it are close to get cooked. We have Pierce Brosnan playing an American (!!!!). And Linda Hamilton playing a mayor (!!!!!!!!!!!!). We have an acid lake, claustrophobic moments near the end in the derelict mine, a lethal cloud that destroys the models...I mean the town! and Riger Donalson building the paced rhythm in a too long prologue but that builds the tension and the suspense.

102,jmhammerstein-980-842586,wonderful movie,10,24 September 2016,Dante's Peak is a great movie. It is about a volcanologist named Harry who learns of unrest at a volcano in the Cascades called Dante's Peak. (Dante's Peak is a fictional volcano.) He goes there and meets the mayor of the town and her children and studies the volcano and comes to the conclusion that it is building to an eruption. The other scientists are skeptical of that until it's too late. The volcano erupts and the mayor's kids go to get they're grandmother because she didn't leave her house on the volcano. The mayor and Harry go to get the kids and they all leave the grandmother's house. That's all I'll say about the story. The movie's got great special effects and it's scary.,Dante's Peak
103,spj-4,all action without credibility - same old disaster-movie plot,5,22 December 2007,"I like Pierce Brosnan as an actor but this is just a film for the natural fury, without any redeeming features but for its superficial roller-coaster ride with fate! I would suggest even ""007"" & these companions in this one, would have surely been immersed into the wreckage several times in reality! I note comments on this site from scientific experts supporting the accuracy of its information about volcanoes. All well & good, but note no comment from them on the chances of a vehicles on fire with its tyres burning & still driving on regardless, occupants safely inside, insightful dog waiting to be rescued at high speed & just happening to be in the path of their escape, let alone a sinking motor boat with motor seized up in boiling waters, but just enough momentum to make the shore, where the heat is somehow not overwhelming. But there's so much more in close escapes, not to mention the trusty government subordinate being right, while his boss belittles his contributions in public, earlier on. True enough. There's a lot of blind bosses out there, but you could see it all coming, so predictably, in this lame offering! But yes, it will appeal to lovers of disaster movie dramas. It's just that this was made close to 30 years after ""The Poseidon Adventure"" & little imagination of progress is anywhere evident.I enjoyed watching it, once but that's all. If you want action with incredulous escapes, go & watch any of the ""OO7"" movies with Brosnan or others, or maybe the Indiana Jones adventures, or the likes of ""The Eye of the Needle"" & ""Three Days of The Condor"" & you'll be far better served than here! I also saw a movie I'd never heard of till today, named ""The Blue Butterfly"", & it was far better than this ordinary re-production of other disaster movies.",Dante's Peak

105,DesertDogMedia,Dante's Peak,7,14 July 2014,"Title: Dante's PeakCondensed Storyline: A volcanologist called Harry Dalton (Played by Pierce Brosnan) is sure that a volcano over looking the town of Dante will explode any minute so it is up to Harry to persuade his group and the town that it is. The whole movie is the scientist's boss won't believe the scientist cliché Notable Acting: Two big name actors in this movie are Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton. That's right, the 5th James Bond and Sarah Conner. They are actors who if you like them you'll like this movie, but if you don't then you're out of luck as this movie pretty much revolves around them. Everyone else is either a secondary character or a supporting character, this means that they do not get much screen time and/or are ultimately boring/typical filler characters. Annoying child actors as usual and not much else to touch on in that area. Noticeable Camera work: Birds tracking shot of getting out of the jeep, nicely done. Establishing shot of the lake and foot of the mountain. Tilting shot to show the sheer scale of Dante's Peak. Worms eye shot for when Terry goes down to fix the robot's leg. Framing of the shot where Harry has just hotwired a green pick up and comes towards the camera and smashed through the gate.Graphics: The practical effects of the explosions are realistic an nicely done and they work in good contrast to the CGI lava/pyroclastic clouds Incorrect Science: Volcanic activity can turn lakes surrounding the volcano acidic, but it can not melt metal anywhere as quickly as shown in the movie. The PH scale of volcanic tainted water would be around 3 to 5 on the scale. That is vinegar to black coffee, acidic and hot enough to cause damage to skin but not quick damage to metal. And before someone says vinegar doesn't damage skin, its not actual vinegar, it shares the same acidity as vinegar. The boat engine was cooled by a water intake system, seeing as the lake in this movie is PH 0, this would cause the interior of the engine to seize up and melt very quickly. Harry tries to drive a pick up truck over a thin crust of lava and comes out with 4 popped tire and a charred undercarriage, the science of lava shows that it is (1,366ºK/1,093ºC) this would melt the tires completely as well as melt the undercarriage along with igniting the fuel tank. There is a scene where they try and outrun a pyroclastic cloud in a truck with 4 melted tires. This is like a human trying to outrun a cheetah, it's not going to work. Pyroclastic clouds travel at 450 mph, you would need a Vesco Turbinator (Wheel-driven land speed holder) to outrun it. One correct piece of science is the helicopter scene, where the helicopter crashes because it is flying in the ash filed sky. Helicopters are similar to planes for the fact that they both have air intake systems for the engine, this can easily get clogged up by ash and cause the engine to stop. Overall Feel: This is one of the best, and when I say best I mean most accurate volcano movies, the science of the volcano is mostly correct and/or scientifically plausible. It is a classic natural disaster B-list movie, with good effects accompanied by decent acting and storytelling in it. So fun movie regardless and is better than Volcano, hands down. With the main point being that Dante's Peak is much better at pacing its movie and teasing the villain (Volcano) until the end of the movie for an enjoyable climax.",Dante's Peak
106,npdeo18,An Underrated Disaster Flick,6,12 October 2019,"I was quite surprised to see the negative reviews for the film. In fact the reviews for this film is quite critical in comparison with Volcano. But the direction of the movie and certain technical aspects of the film are better than volcano. Certain scenes may have been quite unrealistic & predictable but it still was able to evoke enough thrills for a disaster film. Pierce Brosnan was perfectly cast for the role, in fact the producers must have encased on his popularity of being the Bond. But the chemistry between Brosnan and Hamilton was not encouraging in fact someone else could have been casted in the role of Linda Hamilton and the mid portion of the film could have been edited or showcased in a better manner.
Overall the film can be ranked as one of the most under-rated disaster films of all time had it been for better editing and casting.",Dante's Peak
107,blackasp98,Excellent movie,10,2 April 2008,"For a lot of years i have seen enough disaster movies to be critical at seeing how we could see from a on site persons point of view as a vulcanist. This movie was very accurate in showing what the stages are when a volcano erupts violently. From small burps to the anxious singing a volcano does when the esophagus clears for more. The pyroclastic cloud was top notch and just as violent as always shown in the learning channels or discovery channels descriptions. Pyroclastic clouds can reach Fahrenheits of about 600 degrees outside part of a cloud and reach a higher inwards to about 850. It can also burn some ones lungs to a cinder in seconds, and blow buildings off of their foundations in about the same amount of time. This was a great movie to watch, the characters were really good, the backup characters of harry's team was also done well. And the special effects were also top rate, i almost believed that a real volcano was erupting in the movie. As for the other movie volcano with tommy lee Jones, it didn't come close in anyway to the insurmountable disaster that volcanoes have. Roland Emmerich will have to do better next time in his disaster tries down the road. As for this movie i was very impressed.",Dante's Peak
108,forrestwrs,There Is No Suspense,4,15 September 2010,"Dante's Peak is a below average disaster movie that benefits from the great on screen personalities from Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton, but suffers from... virtually everything else.Actually, I'll begin by saying that the everything regarding the erupting volcano looked really cool (except for all of the miniature cars that had no one in it and were obvious models). From the prophylactic clouds to the running lava to the way the earthquake sequences were shot, the erupting volcano looked really cool.But it only *looked* cool. This film is so incredibly predictable that there is no suspense throughout this movie whatsoever. The audience gets a good taste of every conceivable archetype that could appear. A boss who's underplaying everything and acts as the films ""villain,"" an expert no one will listen to, the stubborn old woman who won't leave her home even when it's three minutes away from burning down, the token children who are already one inch away from death...And the scientific inaccuracies are astounding, which includes a truck that *drives* *over* *lava*. If cars could do that as easily as it was in that particular scene, there wouldn't be much need in leaving, would there? Nothing unpredictable happens in the film. All of the good guys live, anyone who was ""bad"" or ""stubborn"" dies.The highlight of the film was Pierce Brosnan, who seems to be too good to even be in the film. He doesn't give what I would consider to be a ""powerhouse"" performance, but compared to all of the other relatively lazy acting that appears in the film, it's easy to view his performance as being exceptionally awesome.At the end of the day, Dante's Peak is nothing special. There's little to offer audiences, and there's no original thoughts in this movie.4/10",Dante's Peak
109,cmcastl,I wanted to bump up Dante's Peak ratings because...,10,7 March 2021,"... of its kind I think it one of the best scripted and plotted disaster movies I have ever seen.The special effects still stand well with today but that is not why I have come to praise it not to bury it.There is a warmth and chemistry in the characters played by Pierce Brosnan, as the vulcanologist, Harry Dalton, and Linda Hamilton as Rachel Wando, the most attractive small town mayor, in the words of one of Dalton's team colleagues, they had ever come across. Within the limited time confines of the plot, their relationship develops believably.What I particularly like about this film is that at least one third of the film is scene setting. The film does not start with an earthquake to build up to a climax, in the prescription of one of the old movie moguls, but the scene setting is allowed to proceed relatively leisurely within the confines of the time limitations, ratcheting up the tension gradually.Most of the characters are sympathetically portrayed and when a couple of them perish, there is a genuine pathos and sadness.The kids are cute without being annoyingly so.Excellent film score, tender and thunderous by turns as the scene requires.If I were a teacher of film, I would recommend this to anyone aspiring director as an example of intelligent and economic plotting and scripting for a disaster movie before all Hell breaks loose.I could and do watch this every few years. That is not the case for most of this genre .",Dante's Peak
110,happytoms,Everything pretty much comes down to luck,7,11 October 2019,"I remember watching this movie when I was very, very young and I kinda remembered parts of but I kept procrastinating watching it again now because I remembered how much I loved it when I was young and I didn't wanted to ruin the good memory of it.
So finally came the day I saw it and I must say even after all these years it's quite enjoyable.
The thing is the movie has quite a long setup building up everything and everyone and then everything just happens all at once and very quickly reaches the end. Overall I enjoyed it but looking at everything now it kinda feels like the characters for the most part in the movie don't think things through and just wing it and hope for the best which really puts them in great danger like the movie portrays it but usually à miracle happens in the last second which saves everyone and everything. This pretty much sums up the movie. I understand the movie has been made for pg-13 and you can't change anything about and I'm okay with that.Overall I think quite a lot of people will enjoy it and some not. Personally, after watching it this feels like not the greatest disaster movie and not the worst one, it's somewhere in the middle around 7 out of 10.

Critics panned it when released, but IMO it has the edge on 'Volcano'. Perhaps it just lacked a catchy tag line that the latter had.The plot is plausible (except the 'acid lake' -- that's just scientific nonsense), the acting is acceptable, and the special effects are, with a couple of minor exceptions, first class.  The exceptions are a couple of scenes during the pyroclastic flow that engulfs the town of Dante's Peak; some small models in that lot, quite obviously.More 'edge-of-seat' than Volcano.

113,Die Hard-3,Not great,6,17 October 1998,"This film was OK, but not as good as 'Volcano'.  The special effects are good, but it seems that the lava did very little.  I think that lava should be a major part of any film about volcanoes (like 'Volcano', when lava is pretty much all there is. At least Dante's Peak has a variety, I guess.) The lava was largely overshadowed by acidic rivers, earthquakes, floods, and so on.  I think that the beginning section could have been much better and that Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton are wasted in this film.  I had high expectations but I was a bit disappointed.",Dante's Peak
114,rorymacveigh-66661,Not as bad as all that!,7,30 March 2015,"For some odd reason we really got stuck with natural disaster movies in the late 90's didn't we? And while this film was released in 1997, at pretty much the exact same time Volcano was getting booted out as well. Out of the two though, this is by far the better movie, largely because it's a much more believable situation with believable characters and scenarios (for the most part, but I'll get to the jarring one's later).So what's the cabbage? Harry Dolton is a Volcanologist working for the US Geological Survey, and is sent to the small town of Dante's Peak in the Cascade Mountains after reports of strange anomalies regarding its local namesake mountain. Upon arrival, he meets with the town's Mayor and moonlighting coffee shop owner Rachel Wando. Although Harry is convinced that the dormant volcano is starting to reawaken, no one else believes him, and he has to try and convince the town and his superiors at the USGS that this mountain is big, bad and ready to blow!Now, the bad parts? This film really is too predictable for words. You know the mountain is going to blow at some point, and you know that the peaceful little town they try to show off as being all beautiful and lovely in the beginning is going to be wiped out. You know Pierce Brosnan is right and everyone else is wrong.Also there are a few very silly scenes that will make you scratch your head in confusion. Firstly, why did the three choose to drive their boat right across the middle of the acid lake rather than sticking to the shore? Why didn't Dreyfus get out of his car on the bridge rather than attempting the impossible? And, most obviously, you can't drive a pickup truck across molten lava and expect to come out okay! Nor can a pickup truck outrun a Pyroclastic Cloud travelling at 200mph! As someone who graduated in Geography, I may have a bit of an advantage, but I'm sure anyone will know that these things really don't happen! Also as a Geography student I was quick to point out the numerous flaws in the geographical accuracy of this eruption, but I won't bore you to death with that!As well as that, there's a few scenes which are simply played for action's sake. One example being in the wood cabin and the Lava bursts through the wall at our heroes. You can't seriously tell me that they didn't notice the fact that things were getting a little hot in there, especially since 1,000 degree lava is literally on the other side of a thin log wall!But there are many good points to this film as well. The story, although predictable, is still quite gripping. The buildup to the volcanic eruption is played quite well and suspenseful, even though you find the other characters stupid for not taking Harry up on his advice even though every single bit of evidence points to him being right!The CGI is also very impressive in places, though perhaps a little choppy in others. The practical effects are good though, especially with the destruction of the town and buildings crumbling. The acting is fairly robust, although many characters have confusing motivations and you wonder why they're thinking what they're thinking, none of the performances are awful per say.Overall, the film is quite gripping though predictable, and even a touch suspenseful in the first half, but doesn't really go down hill in the second half, so much as becomes the standard action movie of running away from the horrible danger with a crescendo of CGI and explosions to top it all off. Not the greatest film ever made and does indeed have many silly moments that do take you out of it somewhat, but it's fairly solid. For a rainy Saturday afternoon movie you can turn your brain off to, this is definitely a contender.",Dante's Peak

119,jamesjchapman-37903,You had to see this on the Big Screen....,9,14 July 2021,"All these years later, I still find Dante's Peak an edge of your seat ride; even on the small screen. But I remember quite vividly watching this on opening day in the cinema and loving every minute of it.Yes, critics will pan the Hollywood theatrics for being over-the-top and or unrealistic. But this movie is all about building volcanic intensity and making you feel like you're trapped in the town with those now desperate to escape. And for that alone I'd nearly rate it a 10 out of 10.There are some very real and tangible elements to what is happening with the volcano. Don't forget you only have less than 2 hours to establish credible characters, a believable plot in a realistic enough town to make this volcano flick unfold at the right time - and pace. Not an easy feat in itself. This movie ticks the boxes.Brosnan and Hamilton carry the movie really well with their key character performances, given that we'd like to see them get the opportunity to indulge some romance. But the big bag bast**d in the background is set to explode and ruin everyone's day - and make ours at the cinema!I love the way this film tickled your nerves in the cinema. There are lots of anxious moments. There are some really REALLY brilliant special effects; remember is was released all the way back in 1997. But all the time you can imagine how terrifying it would be to experience being caught in an event like this. And THAT is precisely what Dante's Peak succeeds at because you feel like you're there, living that moment. That's what good movie-making is about.It's a film about survival that keeps building as our escapees go from one traumatic challenge to the next. But after you watch the movie, you'd definitely think twice about living too close to a volcano - dormant or not. And if you read a little bit about volcanoes, you'll appreciate some of the details in the film just that bit more, too.",Dante's Peak
120,votesmall,James Bond from GoldenEye and Sarah Connor from Terminator team up and to stop a gigantic volcano,7,10 February 2012,"Okay,tell me, that just by reading that brief summary, that you INSTANTLY want to see that movie. I know I did. It all started when I saw The Poseidon Adventure. Then I saw the Towering Inferno. On that disc was a copy of Volcano. I watched it and thought it was fantastic. Tommy Lee Jones was cool and the special effects were pretty great. So, I bought this used for half off and it completely blew (ha ha ha) Volcano out of the water. Here's why. First off, Dante's Peak skillfully builds up tension and interest by slowly introducing the characters. Dante's Peak has been criticized for being too ""slow"", although there is a volcanic eruption in the first scene.Basically, there's this geologist (Pierce Brosnan) who travels to fictional Dante's Peak, Washington to oversee the local ""dormant"" volcano. The mayor (Linda Hamilton) is happy since the town has recently been named one of the most desirable places to live in America. This hot spring is turned into acid because of the volano (No joke, that's possible) and the geologist saves the mayor's kid. The mayor is grateful, and the geologist slowly bonds with the family. However, when the geolosist realizes that the mountain is giving off sulfur dioxide and that it is a ticking bomb, ready to explode. The geologist and the mayor both order an evacuation, but not everyone's exactly too eager to leave, as there is no proof that the volano is ready to blow. But it does, and it creates lahars (mudslides), tephra (airborne rocks the size of semi trucks), pyroclastic flows (gigantic clouds of heavy, superheated, pressurized gases), and ash (little shards of glass). Can they escape Dante's Peak, before the volcano buries them all? Okay, there are a few pros about this film. One, the special effects are awesome. There isn't too much lava, so it looks completely realistic, the tephra looks like it is coming at me, and the pyroclastic flows actually look like they are leaping off the screen. The acting is superb, not over-done, not under-done. Pierce Brosnan gets the perfect amount of root, sympathy, and depth. Hamilton gets the same. The problem is the kids. They are so whiny, stupid, and idiotic that they make me laugh. But other than that, the acting is superb. The plot is something we've all seen before, the ""unexpected"" romance, but this film, unlike Twister or Speed, actually makes it work. They actually build up to it, they seem perfect together, and they are pretty realistic characters.Okay, sure it may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I loved it.Worth a watch.",Dante's Peak
121,GeorgeC,Pointless action flick,5,10 January 1999,"Pierce Brosnan leads an otherwise unremarkable cast in a volcano thriller that never really grabbed me.  Linda Hamilton proves her limited acting range, and although there are some breathtaking special effects, they never integrate into the plot effectively.  A predictable script, except for an uncharacteristically realistic twist, followed by an even more uncharacteristically fantastic last scene, never moves away from its linear path into anything approaching interesting.",Dante's Peak
122,Thulemanden,Nightmare is in your living room,1,8 May 2000,Loodicris collection of movie clichés with a special effects department gone berserk in what is today routine ingredients.The movie is a strange hybrid - something between a naive Lassie movie and a science fiction alien invader movie from the 50's with few opportunities for the characters to make an impression and use their talent for character building.Whatever urged Bosnan and Hamilton to waste their talent on this is beyond comprehension.I still don't know what the staff wanted to tell us with this epic.The moviegoer's nightmare during this trial surely surpasses by far that of the unlucky citizens of Dantes' Peak.I give it minus 1 out of 5.,Dante's Peak

124,Chronus,Dante´s vision of calamity falling upon us should resemble this...,7,20 December 1999,"There´s an analogy, told by Brosnan´s character, that defines this great movie. If you drop a frog in scalding water, he´ll try to jump, to get away from it. But when you boil the water, slowly, with the frog already in it, the frog will dye, and that´s how the story, this story, goes.  Wonderful movie. Fine suspense, good plot (although not astonishingly original), good and well developed characters, good acting and believable special effects. And a fine soundtrack.  Pierce Brosnan is the man of the moment, no doubt about it. He is, by far, one of the best irish actors to appear on celluloid...and no one has yet seen his true potential. And this man knows his choices - he has the eye for detecting good scripts and good movies - from The Lawnmower Man, to Thomas Crown Affair.  Dante´s Peak is a movie about family. It portrays a small town where almost everybody would like to live in - cozy, small, nice, friendly. The delivering of a prize to the mayor of this town is a proof of that.  But before settling the viewer´s attention on Dante´s Peak, the director tells us what happenned to Brosnan's companion when a volcano somewhere in Colombia (?!) erupted. This introduces to the real undertone of the movie - it´s a tragic story, deep down.  Brosnan´s character (a vulcanologist - no kin to mr. Spock, he points out) warns the inhabitants of this town that something may be brewing beneath the earth. As usual, people do not believe him, as happens with every man or woman who tries to reveal new things or break news. This sets the tone for the rest of the movie...until, at last, something tragic happens.   The director showed a firm hand while shooting this story. It´s clear that he showed us and told us things exactly the way he wanted them to be showed or told. Ok, there is no surprise (at least not a big surprise) in the outcome of the story but there´s no need  for it. The sheer intensity of the events, the realism - all this is enough to grip the viewer from beginning to end. The menace to everyday normal life is tremendous, andfamilies must act accordingly or perish. The town perishes, some lives are lost - all due to lack of care and planning. So Dante´s Peak becomes, like Deep Impact, a warning. Pierce Brosnan is great, Linda Hamilton is good enough, and the kids, the grandmother and the colleagues of Brosnan´s character are excellent.
  The science behind the movie´s plot is accurate enough ""a la Hollywood"", naturally.  When I saw this movie, I felt I was in front of a fine work. Money spent on this movie is well spent, as it teaches us many lessons - besides being a pure piece of entertainment.  I recommend it, I loved it. I wish there more movies like this one and Deep Impact -  very well crafted catastrophe movies, not to everyone´s liking, but good examples of how sucessfull a story like this can be when is well told.",Dante's Peak
125,lllama,"Better than ""Volcano""",7,1 August 2000,"Though ""Dante's Peak"" had its share of faults, we (husband and wife) found it enjoyable, particularly the special effects and the small-town character. Having slugged our way through ""Volcano,"" we were not thrilled to be sucked into another volcano movie, but we decided to give it an optimistic try. Without Tommy Lee Jones, ""Volcano"" would have been completely intolerable. We felt sorry for Jones for having been roped into such a stupid movie. What made ""Dante's Peak"" more engrossing for us was the ""it could happen here"" feeling and the fairly smooth flow of plotline.  ""Volcano"" made us angry because the characters' behaviors seemed beyond stupid, in light of the circumstances.  It was as if someone asked them ""what's the worst, stupidest thing you could possibly do in this situation,"" and then told them to do it.  ""Volcano"" seemed so deliberately contrived, and it went on and on forever with contrivance after contrivance.  On the other hand, ""Dante's Peak"" moved along in a fairly logical order, allowing for some realistic human errors, such as the grandmother refusing to move, the children attempting to rescue her, and the boss who didn't want to unnecessarily upset the town.  Granted, if the acid in a lake can eat through a metal boat, it's gonna make quick work of a grandmother--so the grandmother/boat scene was foolish.  Also, a small truck cannot drive across molten lava and it is unlikely that a pickup can navigate a river.  If the director wanted us to believe in the truck's water ability, we should have been given a better reason for its having been equipped for water travel.  However, I don't know how he could have worked the ""driving over lava"" scene to make it more credible.  Perhaps a jump over a lava-filled crevasse or something.In spite of these flaws, the special effects were still convincing enough to keep us engaged.  The only time we began to get fidgety was during the tunnel scene in which Brosnan, attempting to make it to the truck, kept being pelted by falling rocks.  Either the rocks should have fallen at a somewhat constant pace or they should have fallen quickly once or twice. Unfortunately, the rockfalls kept recurring after every few steps taken by Brosnan, and every few moments after he entered the truck.  This repetition got lame awfully quick. Also, as the truck roof was caving in, it's elasticity cheapened the effect.  It was easy to picture a special effects employee leaning on the rubber roof over Brosnan's head.In spite of those things, we felt that the film portrayed a more realistic idea of what would occur if a dormant volcano near a small town became active.  With a few exceptions, the special effects were extremely well-done.  The acting was convincing, as well.  Linda Hamilton's coffee shop mayor reminded me of one of our local state representatives, who runs a small, popular nearby restaurant and nightclub.  Hamilton's character was friendly, helpful, and very likeable, much like our local rep, who's cheery smile and good work keep us voting for her.  Brosnan didn't appear to overexert himself, but he comfortably portrayed his usual charming, intellectual character.  The kids did a great job, and the volcanology crew was convincing.Because I usually find disaster movies somewhat trite, I didn't go out of my way to see this one, but now that I've watched it, I consider it one of the better ones.",Dante's Peak

128,Rhino-1,There's more to Brosnan than Bond,9,29 October 2002,"The plot is fairly a straightforward adaptation of Ibsen's fine play Enemy Of The People, which sees one man trying to persuade the rest of his townsfolk that a disaster is pending. Jaws is a pretty good example of how one man is forced to put his principles on hold before something eventually proves him right; with Dante's Peak, it's Geologist Pierce Brosnan predicting the eruption of a long-dormant volcanoNow Brosnan, while unlikely to ever play Othello or King Lear, is a fine actor in my opinion. He does exactly what it says on the tin, and here he plays the ""man against the world"" very well. He's supported very nicely by Linda ""Terminator"" Hamilton and some pretty impressive child actors, but none of them can hold a candle to the special effects. I'm a sucker for authentic or well designed effects, and the earthquake and eruption scenes here are the best I've ever seen. It doesn't matter that the story is a pretty lame attempt to do for volcanoes what Twister did for tornados; the brooding shots of the mountain that cut into most of the scenes are enough to keep you trying to guess not if, but *when* the whole damn thing is going to explodeThere's a very surreal scene where Pierce and fellow escapees are caught in a powerless boat on a lake that has been made toxic by lava flow; singing Row Row Your Boat while floating on an acidic deathbed - a nicely observed momentWith a neat score by John Frizzel and solid direction by Roger ""Cocktail"" and ""Species"" Donaldson, you could do a hell of a lot worse than spend a couple of hours with Dante's Peak",Dante's Peak

At least Volcano is entertaining, has good characters and a decent plot, and doesn't get on your nerves. This film does. I'm not even going to go into how unrealistic it is - most disaster films are and that's okay, but this one is so much less realistic than any other disaster film I've watched that you can't avoid noticing it - if I started talking about that this film would get a rating zero. As it is, I'm going to give it a four - only because it's so stupidly awful that you keep watching it so that you have a film to moan about afterwards, and a film that you can compare to any other film and say ""compared to this, that movie was brilliant!""",Dante's Peak

The kids were great And the bit with the dead charred squirrels and the acid fish in the boat part EWW!! I felt like vomiting after those bits. And also the kids weren't tools for Pierce Brosnan and Lynda Hamilton to save. The acting was surprisingly incredible and the cgi was used correctly and the sets were good and the pyroclastic cloud is unforgettable when you've seen this movie and the mine sequences were probably painful for Harry cause he got smashed by rocks and smashed by the trucks parts and so what do I think of this film??

132,einezcrespo,Better then that other Volcano flick.,7,29 January 2006,"Living in a geologically active area it's easy to see why Hollywood decided to make disaster flicks. Instead of earthquakes we get volcanoes. If any volcanologist would watch both Dante's Peak and Volcano starring Tommy Lee Jones, they would preferred the former than the latter. I also liked the fact that they did bother to explain a little bit about the science of volcanology in a manner that could be simple. I also approve of the location since the Cascade region does have a fair share of volcanoes. Pierce Brosnan is credible as Harry Dalton and Linda Hamilton is attractive as mayor Rachel Dando are ably supported by a good cast especially Charles Hallahan as Harry's boss Dr. Paul Dreyfuss and Elizabeth Hoffman as Ruth. The chaos during the eruption scenes was maybe a little too far fetched but that's Hollywood for you.

Spoiler Alert.,7,26 November 2011,"Spoiler Alert: I guess my major criteria for any movie is ''was I entertained?"" and my answer when it comes to Dante's Peak is Yes.I do have some issues with some of the details of this film but not enough to spoil the fun in watching it and the actors did a great job with this film, including the two kids.Spoiler begins here: I think my major problem happens near the end of the film when Harry has been trapped in the crushed truck for up to two days with a compound (bone sticking out of arm) fracture of his left forearm and the paramedic gets him out and he's standing up! First of all after two days with no water he'd be dehydrated and on top of that he'd have suffered considerable blood loss from the compound fracture and be in severe pain. He would also be in shock. One of the first things a paramedic would most likely have gotten started before trying to remove him from the truck would be an IV line with saline to replace some of the lost fluids and treat shock. He would probably also have a fever from infection from an open wound being exposed to the dirty environment of that mine further contributing to shock. He would not have been vertical for very long but been loaded onto a stretcher very quickly. But of course the drama of the scene where they are all reunited would have been lost if our hero was on a stretcher. Okay so I'm nit picking but it's a pretty big nit.All that being said, I do own the DVD of this film and have watched it several times because it does meet my criteria - I am entertained by this film and I happen to like Pierce Brosnan's and Linda Hamilton's performances as well as the performances of Jamie Renée Smith as Lauren and Jeremy Foley as Graham",Dante's Peak

Pierce Brosnan makes a convincing scientist, whose passion and desire to protect the townspeople plays off nicely with Mayor Linda Hamilton's similar concerns.But what I most want to say is that the volcano itself was both believable and accurate. So I want to commend the filmmakers for having enough integrity to make an entertaining film within the boundaries of scientific accuracy. And face it, you don't go to a movie like Dante's Peak to see insightful drama, or peer deep into the human psyche. The people and the volcano play off each other very nicely. It's not often you get a film with both chemistry and physics.",Dante's Peak
137,wbg02,watchable but formulaic disaster movie,6,16 September 2003,"Dante's Peak is essentially a formulaic disaster movie.  However, several aspects to this movie at least make it watchable.  Most importantly, the two leads, Pierce Brosnan as the geologist and Linda Hamilton as the small town mayor, give good performances.  They are likable stars, which makes the viewer care about the fate of their characters.  Another good point is that the movie does not include the stereotypical sleazy government or corporate type that ignores the warnings of the disaster.  The objections Brosnan's boss raises to his alarm are reasonable.  Finally, the computer-generated effects are well done. Yet, I can not give the movie a passing grade.  At its heart, it is just a CGI update of a genre that died out in the 1970's.  Also, possibly because of the fictional setting and the complete dependence on CGI, the danger that the town will be destroyed is never compelling.  The viewer wishes that Brosnan and Hamilton (and the dog) are saved, and the movie gives you interesting visuals, but not much more.  Therefore, a 6/10 for Dante's Peak, worth a viewing if its on cable but not worth renting or buying.",Dante's Peak

Brosnan looks good as always, but you keep waiting for some of the magic from the Bond films to come through and save this one. It doesn't happen. Linda Hamilton is still a favorite of mine, but wow... she had to have something to work with here... and between the story/plot and writing.... she was doomed with the rest of the film. Read about the actors comments themselves from interviews and they admit that this was just a paycheck for them.

After Rachel replied it was the red one her daughter said ""Oh! Oh that one."" Well, having been on the stage a few times I recognized a stage line and not a movie line.  One is subtle and the other is too obvious.  I know it's a little thing but since I want the move I rent or buy to be really good, little things like that bug me a bit. Then in the course of the movie we have to deal with an idiot ""Grandma"" who doesn't have a clue.  I guess that's why she lives alone away from everyone. I found myself not caring about her when she died and didn't feel the connection between her and her adopted family. While we're on the subject, why is it that the dog that runs away is soo ugly that your glad it's gone?  Did you notice it ran towards the lava that was headed towards them?  No big deal because the ugly dog lives. So much for the bad, now the good. When I watched ""Dante's Peak"" again I didn't mind the goofs as much because I knew they were there.  I liked Brosnan and even started liking Linda Hamilton in her roll as the Mayor of Dante's Peak.  The hardest thing for me to do was to see her in a romantic role as the only other movie I have seen her in was ""Terminator"" where she was absolutely cold (which was correct for her part).  Anyway, it took a second time thru to make me see her in a different role.  She wasn't too bad.  I guess that's the sign of a good actor. The special effects were quite good and the plot/story line moved forward correctly (for the most part). All in all the movie was a 6 and for me that's not too bad.  My own rating system is based on how many times i could see it in a year without going crazy.  This would be a 3 out of 12 meaning I ""could"" watch it 3 times during the year without any brain damage resulting.  Not a lot of movies get over a three and only the best movies get a 5 or 6.  I don't watch a movie that often except for ""The Natural"" which I made it a policy to watch every month while doing ""Month End"" on the computer system.  That was a long time ago and it is an excellent movie.  ""Dante""s Peak"" is good but not excellent.The Generic Critic",Dante's Peak
141,kevster007us,Excellent Disaster Flick,8,30 August 2009,"I watched this movie again about 6 months ago after having seen it at the movie theater when it first came out. Firstly, the effects are superb. Even with the development of cgi and other fx techniques in the last decade this movie holds up. If this was made this year I would still have been impressed. The plot was pretty standard but once the action started it didn't stop - really a roller coaster ride. Brosnan and Hamilton were fine in their roles though plot and character development took a backseat to the thrill ride. I was thoroughly entertained on a small screen and so was my wife (12 years after being thoroughly entertained at the movies). More please....",Dante's Peak
142,veestar614,"All effects, bad acting, and annoying script, makes DANTE a dull Movie",1,13 July 2002,"In a string of pretty BAD volcano pictures in 1997, DANTE'S PEAK is by far the worst. Although it may seem more likely that a dormant volcano comes back to life than a volcano that unconvincingly pops up in the middle of L.A., DANTE has taken the lava-toasted taco for the worst of the annoying strain. Pierce Brosnan's unintentionally funny dialog was by far the worst, aside from those annoying over-acting kids. I was especially annoyed with the kids, who clearly couldn't act their way out of a paper bag. Linda Hamilton-well-lets just say she's seen better days. The effects, on the other hand, exceeded that of VOLCANO and that, my friends, is where DANTE peaks over its competition. Thats all. Nowhere else. *1/2 out of four. -""You know its BAD!

143,daviddavidlim86,got to remember what ya looking for,6,6 July 2006,"i've always liked this film.. don't think it's crap at all.. well it's outdated when ya watching in year 2006, but you have to remember that this is a action/thriller film of the 90s era and you aren't required to bring your brains when you're watching such films. when i first watched this in 1997, i was very interested in volcanology and there were a lot of things inaccurate in the film, e.g. you never drive into a mine during a pyroclastic eruption because the rock around you actually heats up..then again, i think the criticism is unwarranted and really the critics don't know what they're looking for in this film.. are they looking for a documentary or an action/thriller? if you are one who really can't live without their facts, then you would think this film is a bit over-dramatic and totally inaccurate.. but sit back and shut your brain, and this film isn't too bad at all.. in fact it's pretty good with some of the best special effects seen in the 90s.. the ending is a bit nuff but then again there wasn't much in the film to work with..personally i think Dante's Peak is a bit better than Volcano because it's a lot more believable having the likes of Mount Rainier, Mount Baker, Mount St. Helens explode than the Tar Pits of Los Angeles!!",Dante's Peak
144,superferb,Arguably the best volcano disaster movie,7,15 April 2014,"I like this movie and there are a few reasons for that: 1. Great chemistry between Brosnan and Hamilton 2. Great Special FX without a minimum of CGI 3. Tight storyline 4. Realistic portrayal of a volcanic eruption 5. nice narrative ""tone"" Most people will disagree with me regarding the movie's plausibility, so let me elaborate on this quick: 1. ""You can't outrun a pyroclastic flow"" Yes you can. Some move with almost sonic speed, but some are much, much slower. having said that, the real point is that they don't ""outrun"" the flow at all, they just happen to be close enough to the mine to get there before the flow does. 2. ""There wouldn't be red hot viscous lava"" I agree, and i wish they would have stuck to the facts here. I guess they figured people would feel tricked to see a volcano movie without that kind of stuff so they felt urged to put it in. Also, the lava was used as a plot device, but they surely would have found something else that would have done the trick just as well. 3. ""You can't drive across lava"" I'd say it is possible, it just depends on its temperature and thus on viscosity. Since they are first attacked by quite thin lava, i'd say the movie is simply inconsistent in this regard. They could have made the first lava less fluid as well. However, i don't think the attempt to cross this lava was silly because if they couldn't get away, the pyroclastic flow would kill them for sure. So the decision was okay, and then they had a bit of luck but otherwise we wouldn't have movie, right? 4. ""The lake can't become acidic that fast"" Why not? If there's a real large crack underneath it, gigantic masses of sulfur could be released. I think it's possible, though not very probable. But again, this is a movie. It tries to show the otherworldly hostility of nature in the event of a large eruption. And that it does quite well. All in all, i think it doesn't get much more realistic in a Hollywood near-blockbuster disaster-action movie. It's not a documentary. I like documentaries about volcanoes, but this is fiction and it tries to tell a story. I think the movie hits exactly the sweet spot between storytelling and plausibility. So many more things could have been done wrong: The helicopter could have worked just fine, the volcano could be of the Hawaii-type with primarily thin lava to begin with. The ash and the falling rocks could have been neglected as a lethal force, not to forget the pyroclastic flow, which is not a common element in volcano depictions and might have disturbed some viewers because they just don't know what that is and what it does and that it's in fact so super dangerous. Okay, enough of this subject. Some quick words on those other cinematic qualities: I think the romance is pulled off well by both actors. The whole drama aspect comes across very natural and is not artificially loaded with forced conflict. They understood very well that the threat is the volcano and the volcano alone. I mean, you got a volcano. That kind of eruption is the most deadly thing that can happen to you, so why bother with a villain? Yet many scriptwriters would not lay off the habit of writing a villain in, just because that's what they usually do. And about the effects: It's mostly modeling work, and you can see it. But then, i can also see CGI (as long as the movie is not called ""Gravity""). I see both, and if it can't be done totally unnoticeably, i'm preferring the more organic look of models. The most important point is, that the look is consistent and believable, and this is the case here. After all, it's a disaster movie, so the story obviously is nothing world changing, but it works well. I'd say if you don't like Brosnan's and Hamilton's faces, this movie is not for you. But if you don't have a problem with them, it's a very entertaining movie, and for those not very into geology and volcanology it even provides a fresh and almost informative depiction of a real volcano eruption. Good movie, a narrow 7 if i consider all aspects of cinematic craftsmanship but it actually feels better than that.",Dante's Peak
145,IndiePhlem,What Else Can I Say? It Sucked.,1,29 April 2005,"Mmmmkay. First off I'd like to say that we watched this in science class to see how volcanoes explode, and I'm mad. I want a reason. I want vengeance. I want my 104 minutes back dammit! This movie had the worst plot ever, predictable to the last minute, and no good acting what-so-ever. Whoever wrote the script for this needs to be struck by lightning. This movie is action fodder. There's no romantic interaction for Rachel and Harry, the kids going up the mountain was the most friggin stupid thing I've ever seen done in a movie, and the kentucky fried grandma part was uncalled for. If you need to see a good action movie, count this out.Notes: -Why can't the grandma survive and everyone else dies? That would be cool.-The volcano needs it's own credit.-Peirce Brosnan must've really been tight for money.-I was expecting Rachel to be prettier.-Any movie where the characters say ""Safe"" and ""Desirable"" in the first five scenes is doomed to be crappy.I give this movie 20 burnt popcorns out of 20 possible well-cooked popcorns.

147,cheersfan213,A Kinetic Story With An Undeniable Human Element,9,8 January 2010,"Dante's Peak is a fantastic film that truly captures the essence of the human spirit and also serves as a fabulous achievement in the world of CGI and visual effects. Some of the sequences, such as when Ruth's cabin is inundated with lava, are breathtaking, so much so that you start to think the lava is real and is going to flood straight into your living room. The first hour or so is reminiscent of Alien, as we know something ominous is lurking but can't quite put our finger on an exact time but we know all hell is going to break loose. The best part of Dante's Peak for me, though, is Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton's fantastic chemistry. This is a couple you truly root for, and the intimate dialogue they share at certain parts of the film are the movie's most memorable moments. Only complaint would be the supporting cast--- not as dynamic as the leads and the film suffers for that to a degree. It's not the best action movie I've ever seen and I think the ending could have been slightly more dramatic and lava-filled. All things considered, though, a special film that I think showcases Pierce Brosnan at his most vulnerable best.",Dante's Peak
148,LawlessLegacy,Entertaining Disaster Flick,7,24 May 2012,"I want to direct the first part of my review to the idiotic people giving this film poor reviews. I got exactly what I expected and then some. This is a disaster movie, and a good one at that. People who submitted a poor review must have been expecting an entirely different genre. I read reviews where people criticized it because ""the cast contained too many unknown actors."" That is the biggest line of B.S. I've ever heard. You've got Pierce Brosnan who two years prior had played James Bond in Golden Eye (his best James Bond in my opinion), and Linda Hamilton (Sarah Connor). At the time these were two A list actors. Then I read people mentioning the acting was poor. It's a disaster movie! The acting was absolutely fine and even the children were strong in my opinion. The only negative I could see, which is present in almost every adventure/thriller/disaster/horror movie is when no one listens to warning or concern from the main character. But that's what makes these films. Just putting myself in the situation, I can imagine the frustration Pierce faced when he clearly sensed danger but no one took his word. However this is required to create suspense and allows a build up to the films climax. What I appreciated about the plot is how the grandmother essentially caused all the issues that led to putting the family in harms way then she sacrificed herself to save the lives of the others. I gave Dante's Peak a 7/10 as a general review. If I was rating strictly based on disaster movies I would rate this at an 8.5/10. Definitely worth a watch if you haven't seen it yet.",Dante's Peak

152,nev827,Not a bad disaster movie,7,26 January 2006,"The first time I saw this movie I thought it quite good, especially the roller coaster ride of the last hour or so. I saw it again and thought it not very good at all and now having seen it recently, I not bad, but not great either. It's a well done disaster movie with one challenge after another to survive being thrown at the main characters. This roller coaster ride really pulled me in and even reminded me of the very well done remake of The Fugitive, starring Harrison Ford. I'll admit some of the situations are a little hard to believe, but at least they keep the film from being boring.The chemistry between Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton, while not incredible, is still there. Also enjoyable was how the film makes use of its small town setting, including in the casting characters you'd expect to find in a small town: the female gossip, the gruff, but dedicated sheriff, and the more business-minded don't-rock-the-boat councilman. Finally, Harry (Brosnan) and Paul Dreyfus's band of colleagues also prevent the movie from being flat, but are a little too reminiscent of the characters from Twister to really leave their own mark.Also what impressed me was some of the camera work, which I think isn't given enough credit. There are a number of composite shots of the erupting volcano with the reflection (probably understood to be from a truck's window) of Rachel (Hamilton) looking back in horror that are quite well done. And the digital editing in of the volcano is also well done as well as some of the panoramas.A smaller problem I had with the movie is the development of Harry and Rachel's relationship. Initially their flirtations and the initial ""getting to know each other"" are quite cute. But I can't help but think why Rachel, who has been a small-town girl her whole life would be interested in someone like Harry who clearly states a that his job isn't exactly conducive to settling down. Sure Harry is everything her ex-husband isn't and it's obvious that the both of them are lonely to a degree, but it doesn't seem to me that a woman as sensible and who feels as great a responsibility as Rachel (to her kids, to the town, to her business) would find that to be enough. Also, Harry seems to get over the touchy subject of his dear departed Marianne to start making passes at Rachel in her kitchen quite quickly.My biggest problem with the movie is the writing, which is so bad in some places that it really brings down the parts in the movie where it is good. Harry's line about sex being like riding a bicycle because once you learn you never forget is laughable. Some of the Wando children's lines I found to be lacking in substance too and almost condescending to the viewer. But, as I said, not all the writing is bad: an example is the excellent delivery of a reference to Pompei by one of Harry and Paul's colleagues and another's excitement over Rachel's regular coffee deliveries.In the end, when this movie is bad, it's bad, but in general it's good.",Dante's Peak

Pierce Brosnan as the lead actor is stiff and not believable. With his bumbling leadership in trying to lead a family to safety, this should have been billed as a comedy.

160,Mike-369,A+ for escapism: C- for writing.,6,28 November 1998,"It you are looking for a movie that you don't want to think too hard about, this is the movie. It has lots of scenes and stunts that make this movie an action thriller. If you are looking for a movie that has good writing, continuity, commonsense, etc., you'd better look elsewhere.Harry Dalton, who is proclaimed to be a renowned scientist and foremost authority on volcanoes, comes off looking more like a spoiled brat, than an expert.  He attempts to try calling a townwide alert for a pending disaster that none of his colleagues agree with.  They ask him to give them some scientific proof to justify his claim of pending doom.  Instead, he pouts about it.Harry is assisting with the deployment of a mechanical device to measure seismic readings and the device gets stuck on the side of the mountain. The device cost more than 450,000. Why didn't the helicopter set the device down on the valley of the dormit crater.  Harry insists on alerting the town and not one of his collegues again agrees that disaster is about to occur. Harry starts to pout again and its off to a roll in the hay with the mayor, Rachel.When disaster finally does strike, Harry appears to lose any ability of commonsense, needed for even the simplest of disasters.  He starts off the movie, driving like it was a demolishion derby, then later in the movie, attempts to push a car off the bridge. Later, he trys to cross a stream that is at least three to four feet deep. He scoffs at other cars trying to do the same thing as really stupid. He gets stuck (dah)and only by the grace of the producers did he get away safely. Then, he drives away without any problem whatsoever.  The law of physics says that a motor immersed in water will not run. Harry proceeds to drive over debris with superhuman results. When it seems that they were trapped, they stumble over an alluminium boat for their getaway.  They notice all the dead fish and the boat being eaten by acid. As the water eats the propeller off the boat, Harry wraps his arm with his jacket and starts rowing the boat. When Ruth fears for everyone's safety, she jumps in the water and pulls the boat to safety. They show where the acid ate her legs off, but where the water had gotten on Harry, he appeared fine. Harry finds a truck and drives the crew off to safety. When he tries to drive over hot molten lava as wide as a river, I stopped and wondered if he was sane at all.  With a gas tank made out of alluminium, how did he, a scientist, expect to drive a truck, loaded with Rachel and her two kids over fifty to 100 feet of molten rock and not melt or explode as the gastank melted. Toward the end he finally gets smart and gets the NASA device. Why he didn't try to find another vehicle without melted tires is beyond me but, I guess thats Hollywood. Well, he puts that device in the truck and rams the truck into a cave.  The problem is he forgets to turn it on. Dah!  Harry - wake up!Two days later, Harry's crew sees the NASA light blinking and immediately realizes that Harry is ok. Why didn't it cross their minds that someone could have come back in town and simply turned it on.Maybe Harry was really the owner's son and constantly got into scrapes like this because he was overtly stupid and it was their jobs to lookout for Harry.In either case, watch it for fun, but don't analyze it for quality in script or content.",Dante's Peak

Now that I'm grown up and have rewatched it I can honestly say that while it isn't bad, it isn't as good as my 10 year old self thought it was. Definitely worth the watch though, and showing it to your children a few times when they're old enough to appreciate the story line.
Also, some of the reviews have mentioned Harry and Rachel's relationship and how it was built/forced. It said at the beginning that it was 4 years after Harry's fiance was killed plus they had a weak to get to know each other. And that doesn't take into account the fact that they were in a near death situation together.
Another comment I found is how it's far fetched that Graham was able to drive Rachel's truck when he's about ten years old. Not that far fetched since in real life there was a six year old who stole his parent's car and drove it home because he didn't want to attend church. And, aside from that, yes some of the things in the movie are far fetched, I won't deny that, but they also have more scientific facts in it than some of the other natural disaster movies that are from recent years.",Dante's Peak

Linda has been one of the most talented actresses around for a while. I was very upset that she did not get a golden globe or academy award nomination for T2:Judgement Day. She know what to bring to her roles and how to use them. Mr. Prosnan is a excellent actor. But he is better in this film than in most of the Bond films he has been in. The special effects were awesome and inspiring. Can anyone outrun a paraclastic cloud in a beat up and burned pickup that just drove over red-hot lava? The answer is yes but just barely. Dedication means that you stay with the truck and the NASA signal device for at least 2 or 3 days until someone can drag you out and also get the family you were trying to save.

166,SchuylarB,Dante's Peak and the Science Around It,8,2 July 2021,"Dante's Peak, named after the dormant volcano on which it resides, is considered the second most desirable place to live in the United States. Tasked with determining if the dormant volcano is due for an eruption, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) sends experienced Volcanologist Harry Dalton to the town. After his initial findings of a higher than usual acid content, along with the hot spring scorched bodies of a young couple, Harry determines the volcano is going to wake up and erupt very soon. Rachel Wando, the mayor of the seemingly picture-perfect countryside town, is the only one who believes him at first. After various small seismic readings, the USGS sends the rest of the team in. As soon as the rest of the team decides the volcano is showing regular signs of dormancy, larger earthquakes start at the center of the mountain. This is just the start until a sizeable earthquake occurs which is followed by an eruption that leads to pyroclastic flow, ash fall, avalanches, and more hazards. As Dante's Peak becomes increasingly dangerous, Harry and Rachel must rescue her kids and escape the fury of the explosive volcanic eruption.The scientific aspects of Dante's Peak are quite accurate to a certain extent. It is true that in real life volcano activity is measure with gas emission readings (CO2, SO2, and H2S) and seismic readings, just like in the movie. Another very realistic part is the tough decision placed on the local government to decide whether to evacuate or not as there are politics to consider and major economic loss on the line. It is possible for magmatic shifts to release hot magma into the springs, but it would explode rather than boil. Dante's Peak is modeled after Mount St. Helens and is realistic until it starts to spew basaltic lava which is characteristic of an effusive Hawaiian eruption and not a felsic explosive one. A very true to life effect that was a focus in the movie, where the super-heated and ominously dark pyroclastic clouds. As the eruption continues, the fleeing protagonist and love interest must get across a lake that has turned acidic due to the volcanic eruption. While it is possible for volcanic activity to create an acidic lake, it would take much longer for the lake to become acidic enough to melt the boat. Even if the lake was that toxic that quickly, the fumes would have killed them before they could safely cross. Another dramatic improbability is when Harry drives several miles directly into a mineshaft on lava burnt tires that are somehow still functioning.Overall, it is very science based, if not a little extreme for dramatic effect. It is a very good and interesting watch and should be recommended to any action movie or volcano enthusiast.",Dante's Peak

168,decembergrit-95984,LOVE THIS MOVIE,10,28 January 2018,This is a great movie. I've seen it more times than I can remember. It's 2018 and I still get anxious and upset when they go across the lake in the boat and the grandmother jumps out to save them; when Ruffie jumps in the truck; when they get in the cave and when Pierce gets stuck in the truck and turns on R2D2 and it beeps. :) lol It's a Classic for me.,Dante's Peak
169,omegaxshook,One of my favorites,9,19 January 2018,"First off, yes I get not everything is 100% factual, but it's not far off from fact. The movie is almost like a re-telling of Mt St. Helens. Its a good disaster movie to watch and I enjoy watching it. Linda Hamilton who played a tough woman in the Terminator movies, does a great job at playing her sweet damsel in distress type of character, yet strong and bold. Peirce Bronson is a guy I would want with me in this situation, he plays the character perfectly.Its a great movie, and if you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it.",Dante's Peak

171,ccccfagin,"Love this movie, but...",8,18 April 2021,"This is probably one of my favorite disaster movies, but a few things bother me about the storyline. After the incident in Columbia we see Pierce Brosnan's character get a call from his boss Paul stating he needed to come in. So apparently he was not going to be at work. He's told to go to Dante's Peak and check it out. Once there Harry is concerned enough to call in reinforcements. He's then told he's overreacting and to go on vacation. Why call him out if you're not going to listen? The second thing that bothers me is that the USGS is stated to be in Vancouver, but the characters state home base is in Portland...which is it? By now I've guessed I've watched it too many times and am over analyzing. But still great flick.",Dante's Peak
172,EmoFolkKid,Good example of how bad a movie really can be...,2,21 February 2002,"It was so terrible I can't believe how bad it was..It's a natural disaster movie and noone dies..FOUR PEOPLE, only two of which are of any significance, how unbelievable is that, typical sappy moment, with the Pierce ""Pathetic Performance"" Brosnan and Linda ""Least Desirable Female"" Hamilton kiss, Brosnan laid in car bloody and broken apart for 2 days and he climbed and walked away just with a limp, a dog with 2000 degree lava surrounding it jumped off a cliff into the back of a pickup truck, but the best without a doubt, was the giant volcanic cloud that moves in reality about 100-150 mph, BEING OUT RUN BY A PICKUP WITH FOUR FLAT TIRES..ugggggggghhhhhhhhh awful movie, if you waste your time, its your own fault...what a godawful movie",Dante's Peak
173,jack-mart,The greatest volcano movie ever,8,31 March 2010,"This was better than volcano. It had good acting. Good actors Linda Hamiltan, Peirce Bronsman They both played there parts very wellThe earthquakes sequences were realistictAnd good special effects. While it sometimes unrealistic such as well .Driving through lava in a truck. Outrunning a giant cloud . And a Kid driving a car.But it's a great film with a love story. This the greatest volcano movie ever made with a love story.Dante's Peak 10/10",Dante's Peak
174,rob_lake,don't bother -Spoilers,1,8 September 2003,"This movie might have the worst script I've ever seen.  It was purely an excuse to show off the special effects, which by the way are decent for 1997.  But the movie's storyline is SO AWEFUL, and the ability for the stars to escape harm SO UNBELIEVABLE, that the five minutes of special effects are just not worth it.  The only thing that could have saved this movie would have been to brutally kill Brosnan, Hamilton, and the dog.  I can't believe I wasted my time.  Don't make the same mistake.",Dante's Peak
175,slickwombat7,silly but fun,7,14 January 2004,"Dante's Peak is a disaster movie, and is saddled with just about every disaster movie cliché you can think of. Actors spend more time shouting and running than anything else; natural events tend to ""coincidentally"" happen right at the most dramatic possible moment; non-key characters are killed off so the stars have something to be sad about; and so on. It's even got what is, to me, a nearly fatal flaw: absolutely awful, strident child actors.So it's definitely formulaic and occasionally irritating, but for all that it's still a very watchable and enjoyable film. The volcano effects are realistic and exciting; there's enough background science to keep things interesting; and if the acting isn't exactly stellar it's at least appropriate. Definitely worth watching if (like me) you find volcanoes inherently interesting.",Dante's Peak
176,marqus32,Disaster Movie YES!!!,10,18 October 2013,"I really despise Hollywood disaster flicks because they tend to forget about the basics of life and try to entertain moviegoers. Which usually makes a crappy movie. I thank the man who woke up one day and said ""I have an idea for a movie. It's called Dante's Peak."" The movie consists of a geologist and his crew, a mayor of a town with her kids, and an sleeping volcano that awakes with a vengeance. The main character is basically trying to convince a mayor that the next door neighbor might be waking up soon and should take precautions to prevent fatalities if his predictions on the volcano erupting are correct. Eventually he is correct and the volcano blows up. The great thing about this movie is the amount of science used in the movie. The only thing that is off is that there is no possible way that a geologist can look as awesome as Pierce Brosnan.",Dante's Peak

178,jamesdew-28306,Its alright,5,9 June 2020,"When I was but a wee boy i thought this was the most terrifying movie ever created. I recently re-watched it and have decided that it is nothing better then mediocre.At a glance its just a movie about a volcano erupting and the people around it trying not to die; but when you take a more in depth look at it you come to the realization that it is, in fact, nothing more than just that.For all its flaws however it isn't a boring movie and it manages to trundle through its runtime without making me want to switch it off.Brosnan manages to carry the movie on his shoulders but the movie itself comes across as rather cliche, we know that he and the other main characters are going to make it out the other side; and of course there is some emotional deaths dotted about, but even they can be seen coming from a mile away.Although it isn't the best disaster movie out there it is far from the worse, especially some of the more recent ones (perhaps starring Dwayne Johnson). And finally if someone were to ask me to recommend a volcano disaster movie, this would likely be the first one to spring into my mind.",Dante's Peak
179,wdw26,Has its good points,7,8 May 2020,"So I've been revisiting or watching for the first time flicks during quarantine, and thought I'd give this one another shot. I originally saw it on DVD the year after it came out. I'm a fan of Pierce Brosnan's but this wasn't a fave movie of mine at the time. Watching it again, I was still bothered by the unrealistic scenes and cliques, but I think now that I'm older I appreciate the performances more. The movie did attempt to incorporate some science and has character development, which is more than can be said about most disaster flicks. The movie starts off slow but does get more exciting as it goes on. At the time I wasn't really into Linda Hamilton's character, but I connect more with it now than I did back 23 years ago, too. I was surprised that I enjoy Pierce Brosnan's performance more now than I did. He's low-key, but has a human, vulnerable side in this that's appealing. I actually think I like him more as an actor now than I used to.",Dante's Peak

183,wecard1129,Was the script written in a weekend?,4,20 March 2001,"I really think there is a computer somewhere that comes with a template for movie scripts.  I think this movie was written from that template.  The characters development never got deep, the plot was predictable.  The action sequences once the volcano started erupting were exciting, but I kept expecting something even bigger at the end.  They go into a mine and then they're rescued, then it's over.  It just dies at the end. Yuck.",Dante's Peak
184,peterhump3,Read a book instead.,1,17 July 2006,"This is one of the worst films ever made. Ever. The script at best simply reiterates the plot. At worst is drivel. It draws on historical events in an attempt to create believability in the film's plot however, there is no consistency of science throughout. My favourite scene is where Pierce is driving a metal fishing boat across an unusually rapidly formed lake of sulphuric acid. In the boat with him are the mayor of the town (who also works in a coffee shop) (?) Her 2 kids and their grandma. Halfway across the lake the acid has dissolved the off-board motor's propeller, although not the base of the boat. He proceeds to row the boat straight ahead to the shore with just his right hand wrapped in his jacket. The grandma jumps ship and walks the last 10 meters screaming, up to her waist in the acid. In the next scene her jeans are torn apart by burns (sorry I'm laughing now). Actually maybe the scenes where Bond drives a jeep style truck through a river without dying, then over flowing, molten lava with the tires catching fire but not actually melting are my favourites, it's hard to decide really. The saddest thing is that I lost about 2 hours of my life watching this on TV the other day, half an hour registering and writing this now and that there's no way on earth that this mess of a film is going to create enough enthusiasm in someone to actually read my carefully constructed thoughts.",Dante's Peak
185,extrememan_3,Dante's Peak might be worth a second look to find whats behind the scenes,6,23 October 2006,"Dante's Peak is based on the 1980 eruption of Mt St Helens, basically the same setting, people who live on the foot of a dormant volcano don't know it's dormant, don't believe scientists until it's too late. In movies, there are always heroes who alway survives conditions in the movie that will actually kill without doubt. I personally think that Dante's Peak is one of the best volcano films I've seen. Some facts sacrificed for our entertainment and action, there are some examples of where the movie changed the facts for us to enjoy like: - Glass lake couldn't have turned that acidic that quickly. (the bit where the Grandma's legs are nearly melted off) - The pyroclastic flow should have smashed the green jeep into pieces before it even got close to the underground hideout, seriously what affordable land vehicle can exceed 800kmph? - Too many people escaped the volcano's wrath while people would normally have a few minutes. - The noise of the eruption shouldn't have been heard by anyone in a 60mile radius. - The actual lava was too runny for a composite volcano of that size, the lava should have been slow and thick. - The tyres didn't melt in the extremely hot lava when it got stuck.Overall, I think that the movie itself was too concentrated on the relationship of Harry and Rachel not the actual eruption itself. I suggest a second look for people who have already watched it.",Dante's Peak
186,scrooge-15,most impressive,10,16 December 2006,"Dante's peak is MOST impressive. It is MORE realistic than ""Volcano"" I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes intense action all the way right to the end.I have seen it quite a number of times & I NEVER tire of it. It is SO exciting. This movie is the most impressive Volcano type I have seen. I currently have Volcano (DVD), Volcano : Fire on the Mountain (VHS) I also have Journey to the Centre of the Earth (1993)I just cannot stress enough how well ""Dante's Peak"" was made. There is not much more I can say here since 10 lines is a LOT.

187,Tramajunky911,Great Movie but Almost a Remake,7,27 October 2019,"While this movie was great for some of it's character development, and special effects, the storyline itself is almost identical to the 1981 film St Helens starring Art Carney. A volcanologist goes to a sleepy town and predicts the volcano will erupt, and is shut down by his superior as being an alarmist, yet the scientist is proven correct and along the way falls in love with a local girl, and there's that one stubborn person living by the lake at the base of the mountain refuses to leave. Only difference is this movie is fiction, while St Helens is based on actual events.

Someone should tell Pierce Brosnan that not only is not James Bond anymore, but he wasn't even a very good James Bond in the first place.  Linda Hamilton's only other REAL credit is the Terminator, need I say more?  The Grandmother jumps into an acid lake.  WHAT KIND OF LOGIC IS THAT?

190,filmdjango,Wasted opportunity,3,20 January 2003,"This could so easily have been much better. It's obvious that a large fraction of the budget was spent on the effects, but realistic destruction scenes do not make a good film. Had some of that effects budget gone into storyline and screenplay, it could have worked out much better.

It's just such a large eruption, which really hasn't been witnessed in our lifetime so people think it's overdone. It really isn't. It gets pretty cheesy at times though, the dialogue could be better. The part of this movie that's unbelievable is how everything that could possibly go wrong does, but somehow the characters always have a way out (as usual). Driving across scorching lava without the gas tank exploding? Come on. Most people faced with this situation would have no chance in hell of surviving but this is Hollywood folks.",Dante's Peak

Simple story line with likeable characters and possibly some of the best pratical visual effects Hollywood has ever done. It was only a few years later until nearly every movie was overflowing with CGI. Compare this film to one like 2012 and you'll agree that cgi is no substitute.,Dante's Peak
194,gramccrossan,Good effects that show good volcanology,5,18 April 2013,I thought that the effects for the volcano were impressive at the time and that they were very realistic in how the volcano erupted and that scenes such as the beginning were impressive at the time.There were some parts that were silly such as when Rachael's kids Graham and Lauren driving Rachael's truck to their grandmother's house and that the romance between Harry and Rachael's romance was forced at times. I also think that Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton were a bit out of place and that they didn't need to be in the movie. I also thought that the scene when Harry and Rachael's family drives a car over hardened lava which was just unrealistic as the car would have melted and kill them. If you're interested in volcanology you might like this movie.,Dante's Peak
195,elliottforbes-662-447949,"Strengths, weakness and overall review",7,18 April 2013,"I thought the movie was good in some areas. these areas were the special effects like when the volcano go's of. The movie was also very accurate in terms of the volcano's but it wasn't very accurate with realism for example when they drove through the lava near the end was very unrealistic because the lava would have been 1000+ degrees so the car would have melted and the fuel tank would have went up in flames and blew the car up. the story line it's self was good and very original and i have never seen a movie like it. The movie is very griping from the start there is action and it makes you want to keep watching.The things i didn't like about it was there wasn,t enough emotion in the movie i always felt like they were going to make it out alive. Another thing that i noticed was that at the start a pyroclstic bomb came down on Harry's girlfriend and the bomb would have drove the car straight into the ground taking harry with it.One thing i would have changed was one of the children getting killed to make it a bit more sad. so at the end about a year later they could have been putting flowers on the child's crave so it wasn't such a happy ending.I would recommend this to students aged 12~14 that is interested in Geography but overall i would say it is a good movie but not the most realistic.",Dante's Peak
196,thomasmayne99,Not Bad,5,18 April 2013,"It Was a alright movie overall.The things that i liked in Donte's Peak would have been the special affects in the movie for example how the mud-slides and lava were presented. Most of the movie would have a lot of tension when you were watching it because you didn't know when the volcano was going to go off. The C.G.I was well disguised like when the volcano went of and how the some cloud smoke would have been there. Some of the things that i thought were ""unrealistic"" would have been when the jeep went through the river because the whole of the jeep except the roof was under water so that would have flooded the engine and the engine bay so jeep would have cut out. Also the movie went to quick because one minute one thing was happening and then the next minute something else was happening. Last of all the movie could have contained more humor because the movie wasn't really that funny. To improve the movie i would have took more time to explain things more and added more humor. I would not recommend this movie to someone who liked to watch movies but i would recommend it to someone who studies or has an interest volcanoes and things to do with geography.",Dante's Peak
197,rhiannn-663-62554,Very entertaining movie:-),8,18 April 2013,"My class and I watched this last week as we are in the middle of learning about volcanoes so I thought this movie was very entertaining and helpful with teaching me and out volcanoes:-) some strengths that made the movie good were the technology and the graphics that they used good because it made them seem more realistic. I also thought the love story was good. Some weaknesses of the movie are when they are in he truck and he has to drive over the lava, it is quite unrealistic because the lave would have been 1000c so the tires wouldn't have just went on fire they would have completely melted.it also could have had a bit more humor in it as it was a bit too lovey dovey for me. I think at the end they should have ended it better by showing you the children and Harry and Rachel all going fishing like he promised them in the cave or even they could have ended it by showing you Harry and Rachel getting married which they probably will in the future. I would definitely recommend this movie to others especially anyone who is learning about volcanoes as it shows good images and describes the eruption of a volcano very well:-) Good movie to watch!x",Dante's Peak
198,sassydoo,Great movie! Could be improved.,8,18 April 2013,"I liked the movie because I enjoyed the effects and the build up to the eruption. The events leading up to the eruption were very dramatic as accidents happened that were disturbing. I also liked how there was a love story in the film to give it a twist. I didn't like the parts that involved really disturbing scenes that involved lots of blood etc. At times, I found it quite annoying how the love story interrupted some of the larger activities that were happening with the volcano and it's eruption. I was also uncomfortable during parts of the movie, this is because I felt I couldn't look at the screen due to some of the unrealistic events e.g. the boat melting and the dog making it through the eruption whilst the granny didn't. I think the movie could have been made better by making some scenes more realistic. I also think making the eruption more dramatic and not having such a happy ending would making it better. I think this because it is unrealistic for everyone except the granny to make it out alive. I recommend this film to those with a strong stomach for the special effects. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the film.",Dante's Peak
199,ExtremeICcream,Good Movie but unrealistic at parts,7,18 April 2013,Good Movie with good effects for the time the movie was made. As soon as the movie starts you are already watching an erupting volcano as it destroys a village. Sadly Harry's(Pierce Brosnan) girlfriend gets killed by a pyroclastic bomb as it falls through the cars roof as they were getting away.The movies itself could be more realistic as when they drove the car through lava it would have melted and blown up as it was so hot. The movie also could have contained more humour as it was serious at most parts and it contained quite a bit of gore such as harry breaking his arm. They also survived when they really shouldn't have because they would have been blown up in the car and the pyroclastic flow would have killed them as it moved way too fast for them.I would recommend it to people wanting to see volcanoes but if you don't like gore it really isn't for you also there was a bit too much love story in the movie and most of the time there wasn't much volcano scenes.,Dante's Peak
200,ltmcauley,Dante's Peak Review,6,23 April 2013,"Dante's Peak is a typical movie with both strengths, weaknesses and a good plot. This movie has strengths when coming to the volcanic effects e.g. the pyroclastic cloud and the unique eruption of the volcano. These fiery effects are realistic and believable. The plot of this film was intriguing but also had its downsides. A rewarding part of Dante's Peak was the tension that was gradually progressing throughout the movie. This was just enough to keep the viewer engaged and want to see the ending.Things that let this movie down were, when Pierce Brosnan drove over the flow of lava which just about melted his tyres, but somehow was unable to set the fuel tank on fire. Another, is when their dog made it across the lava and acidic river which easily could of killed the dog both times,these were unbelievable parts and didn't help the movie in anyway. Throughout this movie parts were skipped and there wasn't much time to familiarise yourself with the characters and their background lives.If re-making this movie I would change the story line and make it more educational and humorous. For me this movie lacked in humor and they must of found it difficult to disguise what was going to happen as you could clearly tell the volcano was going to erupt with one glance at it releasing its smoke. Dante's Peak could have been better but the effects and realistic plot is what made this movie stand out on educational purposes. For me I believe that this movie is good to show in schools as it lets you see just how villages,towns etc. react when under pressure and close to a major volcanic eruption.",Dante's Peak
201,nickbenrobbie-davis35,A review on Dant's Peak,7,21 April 2013,"I thought the movie was good in most of the the main areas. One of the areas were it was good was the plot,the plot had the right amount of of action and tension. Also the special effect were good when the pyroclastic flow wiped out the town. The CGI was used well because you would need a lot of it in a film like this. There were a few weaknesses like it was quiet unrealistic when the car drove over the lava flow, also how the dog got over the lava flow and finally their was not much humour in the film, it was all doom and gloom. What i would change in the film to make it better would be to make it more realistic also to add in some humour to keep the viewer engaged in the film also to add in a better ending with a bit more action in it.I would recommend it to people as it is a good film overall.",Dante's Peak
202,jamesmalcomson,make believe,4,18 April 2013,"Strengths: 1.I enjoyed the dog surviving numerous of times when it jumped into the jeep with only one chance it would have of surviving and also it coming out of the mine still living. 2.When Harry, Rachel the granny and the kids went to the hot spring and found the dead naked bodies, I thought this is a really good way of teaching the people watching this movie how hot the water really is. 3.I also enjoyed the scene when the granny died due to her acid burns which she got when she jumped into the river to save her grandchildren.Weaknesses: 1.The most unrealistic scene in my opinion was when a lava bomb hit Harry Dalton's a vulcanologist girlfriend on the head but didn't go straight through her and pass through the jeep floor at the start of the movie, this seem very strange that the lava bomb sat in her body. 2.That Harry Dalton ""vulcanologist"" could tell how long ago did Danté's Peak volcano explode by examining a rock on the mountain. 3.When the boat on the river as they where traveling downstream was melting due to the acid in the water, why is because acid does not dissolve metal that quickly that is scientifically proved. Opportunities: 1.This movie had also a romantic genre in it involving Harry Dalton ""vulcanologist"" with Rachel Wando ""Town Mayor"" that didn't lead to anywhere Harry only said at the end of the movie that Rachel, the children Lauren and Graham and himself would do and do things when the volcano settled down but the movie didn't show it. 2.When the experienced team that Harry worked for looked up at the volcano it somehow seemed much far away than when Rachel looked up at it from Harry's jeep window when it had exploded. 3.It was kind of obvious that the volcano was going to explode with all the tension before it explode but sill Paul the experienced teams boss still denied when Harry pleaded with him to put the town on alert, he wouldn't because he did not believe Harry that the volcano was going to explode. Threats: 1.If I was the director of this film i would make the ash cloud more realistic because it looked very similar to to another movie's black smoke effects. 2.Danté's Peak is boring for most of the film, is because it's poorly written and simply because I knew the kind of build-up because i've experienced it countless times before. There's not much to get excited about when you can figure out what's coming next without particularly engaging your brain. 3.I would most certainly change where they where in the mine because the mine collapsed, but did not kill Harry while he sat there in one position for at least two days said one of his workmates",Dante's Peak
203,hollymal11,My Dantes Peak review for DHS,8,18 April 2013,The strengths of the movie: The tension and Thrill in the plot was good. Had a lot of Cliffhangers. Good cast and some good acting. Educational to viewers who are learning about Volcanic Activity and Volcanos in general. Some of the effects in the movie are great for the time.The weaknesses of the movie: To many characters to remember and not many have really much of a background story or really mentioned through out the movie. Only when they are seen on the screen. They also didn't explain fully the effects of volcanic eruptions. They just expected you to know everything. Also depending on the budget and the time the movie was made the CGI effects could have been better. Some parts of the movie were a bit rushed and skipped.Bloopers and My opinion: It could have less characters . To many to remember for my liking. Be more educational instead of a love story.. Be more correct and realistic eg. The car tyres would have just melted by the heat of lava before even going on it.To others: I would recommend it but not for educational purposes but the thrill of the plot and the volcano. This was Holly reviewing Dantes Peak. Bye.,Dante's Peak
204,matthew-mcdade22,"Impressive, but unrealistic.",7,23 April 2013,"My friends had reviewed most of the movie up until he part i saw at the end. The last few scenes were very tense when the characters were trapped in the underground caverns and this made them really come together. The computer generated imaging was very impressive when th great Pierce Brosnan's elbow broke when he was nearly crushed by falling boulders. I found hat the special effects for the volcano were brilliant with the destructive with the destructive ash cloud and pyroclastic bombs hurtling down to earth. I found that the pickup truck driving over a 1000 degree lava flow with just the tyres bursting was kind of unrealistic, he whole car would have melted! When the dog had to make a jump to the car from the nearby rock it was sitting there like it was fine but the heat rising from the lava flow would have made it lose its hair and burn it, I found this unrealistic. I would recommend ti film to other year 10 pupils studying volcanology. I rate it 7",Dante's Peak
205,entrixclan,Nothing special...,7,22 April 2013,"The movie was a good movie, there was not much to it though. the story did focus a lot on the love of the two main characters and it should of been more focused on the volcanic activity and not interrupted the movie with an absurd love story during a volcanic eruption!!! to me it seams highly illogical. If you were consider viewing this particular film i would rent it and not buy it. The story of the film is based around a vulcanologist who goes to a small town and tests a volcano for activity and there appears there is activity and it could end up in a volcanic explosion... i will say no more as it is a massive spoiler if i do tell you anymore.this film was quite enjoyable and i would recommend it to a geology student and i would also say that it had good special effects in it for its time.7/10 volcanoes :)",Dante's Peak
206,amygray424,A Review of Dante's Peak.,7,22 April 2013,It was a very good movie. It was of use to me because I was learning about Plate Tectonics and Volcanology. The plot was good because of the tension and build up. I liked the special effects and how it was done. I liked the happy ending. I thought that it was a bit unrealistic because of when the car was driving over the lava the wheels would have burned and some of the car too. It was horrible when two people were found dead in the Hot Springs and when the Granny's legs were all blood from the acid in the lake. I would have liked to see if Harry done things with Rachael and the kids Lauren and Graham. However the movie didn't show anything after everything was OK. There was a little to much love story between Harry and Rachael. I would recommend this to other Year 10 students or people learning about Volcanoes as it is a useful movie to watch.,Dante's Peak
207,clingan1,Dante's Peak and my opinion of the film,8,22 April 2013,"I liked Dante's Peak because it was in good detail and it showed me how they measure and record the activity happening in the Volcano. I am also a year 10 student and it has helped me understand clearly how you know if a volcano is going to erupt and what makes it erupt and the damage it causes. It was good and exciting when Pierce Brosnan took risks to get out of town alive. Although I think there were some unrealistic scenes like driving over the lava,when they were in the boat in the acidic lake and it started to melt away, I think it melted to quickly and the pyroclastic bomb at the start which hit the car I thought would have done more damaged .They could have made the movie better by adding some more drama with the volcano at the start of the film. This film should be watched by others as I recommend it.",Dante's Peak
208,callum896,A very enjoyable movie!,7,23 April 2013,"I really enjoyed watching this movie, my class and I watched it last week in school as we were studying volcanoes. The movie had good special effects that looked realistic, and the volcano and ash cloud looked very good. It started off in the midst of an eruption of a volcano so it was tense and had you hooked from the start. I enjoyed the love story between the two main characters Harry(Pierce Brosnan) and Rachel(Linda Hamilton). I thought that it added a bit of life to it so it wasn't all a disaster movie. There were some moments that I found unrealistic such as the scene where the family are in the car during the eruption and they have to cross the lava flow, the temperature would have been at least 1000 degrees or possible more, the extreme heat would have done more than melt the tires, it would have lit the car on fire, and blown the fuel tank causing the car to explode! Also how did the dog survive through the eruption? It managed to find the family and was found perched on a rock surrounded by the lava flow. Being that close to it would have done damage to the dog and it being unharmed was slightly unrealistic. There was some sad moments in the film such as when the Grandma(Ruth) sacrificed herself to save the family. I thought it had a happy ending as well with Harry and Rachel becoming a couple and taking the kids to Florida to go fishing. I would definitely recommend this movie to people, it was also helpful if you are studying volcanoes. Overall a very enjoyable movie!!! :)",Dante's Peak
209,emma-mccoosh,This was an amazing movie.,8,23 April 2013,"I am studying vulcanology and this movie helped me understand it and made my work on volcanoes come alive. I liked the start and the end because it built up a lot of tension and introduced you to all the characters at the start, and I liked the end when the volcano erupted because there was a lot of action which made you keep your eyes on the screen. It was nice at the end when they all got out of the tunnel where Harry Dalton (Pierce Brosnan) got jammed in his car with all the back rocks falling on top of him breaking his arm seeing the bone protruding. In the middle of the movie when the volcano erupted and the two children went up the mountain to get their granny, it was predictable and you just knew that they were going to be trapped at Dante's Peak. I think they could have made this part a little less obvious. I would recommend this to anyone 13 and above and not just to people studying vulcanology.",Dante's Peak
210,esomerville74,"Great Movie, but where is the rest?",6,23 April 2013,"Dante's Peak was a really interesting and quite a good movie. I found this movie very interesting because I am learning all about volcanoes, and watching this movie helped me understand more about volcanoes.I really liked the whole plot and the tension that was built up and I just wanted to keep on watching the movie to see what happened.But despite the movie being quite good there were parts I thought that could have been much better like the special effects. The special effects didn't look like they were real and it sort of ruined the whole movie a little. I also didn't really like the way the movie jumped about so quickly from one thing to another and you were left wondering what happened during all those parts that the movie didn't show. And finally I would have also liked to see more of the volcano erupting because it only showed a little of the it erupting. But overall this movie was quite good but if it had better special effects and didn't jump about so much and you saw more of the volcano erupting then it would be a really, really good movie! But I would definitely say to you watch it because it is really interesting and if you are learning about volcanoes it really helps you understand more about them!",Dante's Peak
211,jordydog,Interesting and enjoyable. Worth watching!,8,23 April 2013,"I enjoyed the tension in this movie, how at one point everything is fine, then something can happen to change the story. The special effects were very good and made the film seem very real. The CGI in this film was also very realistic. I do think the film became very gory when you see Harry Dalton's arm broke in half. I think it was a bit unrealistic in the scene where Harry drives the truck over hot lava and gets it stuck. Should a vulcanologist not have known that hot lava would set the tyres on fire? I also think it was a bit stretched how quick the acid melted the bottom of the boat and the propeller, in the scene where Ruth is being rescued from her house. Overall I think this is a good movie and would recommend it to anyone, but especially to someone studying volcanoes as it is very informative.",Dante's Peak
212,jonahe08,Disaster movie about an erupting volcano,8,23 April 2013,"This film is about a volcano Mt St Helen's erupting killing people and destroying a small town (Dante's Peak) below it.The main characters are Pierce Brosnan the volcanologist and Linda Hamilton the Mayor of Dante's Peak.There is a good build up throughout the movie, getting to know all the characters and seeing their relationships develop before the disaster happens.The movie has many strengths. It appears to be scientifically accurate about the behavior of a volcano and how unpredictable it can be and the devastation it can cause. The scenery is stunning and the special effects are awesome. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole way through and you can believe every characters situation. It has a few weaknesses. A bit unbelievable that the young boy could drive a van up the mountain when his feet couldn't touch the pedals! Also trying to outrun the pyroclastic flow, I think you would be in pieces. Most unbelievable scene was driving the car through lava, very entertaining - lava can reach 2000 degrees, don't think there would have been any signs of the car left. Don't care about that I loved it. I would give the movie 8.5 out of 10. It really gave me an interest in volcano's and how they work. It showed how people might react against such a treat in their town and how the town's council would try and play it down hoping it wouldn't happen. I don't think they could have improved it, there was action, a love story, fantastic special effects and you learnt about volcano's as well. A bit soppy in places, but hey it's the movies.",Dante's Peak
213,ehamill2002,Brilliant story but parts of it are missing,7,23 April 2013,"Dante's Peak is a brilliant movie that is good for any 14 and up who are studying volcano's as the special effects of a movie over 10 years old are very good. Although the movie is very good it has a bit to much romance for me. It is has bits of humor throughout the movie such as ""coffee,my favorite time of day"". Some bits of the movie don't add up such as how the dog got over the lake when it was acid or how the grandmother didn't die instantly in the acid lake. Some of the ways I would improve the movie would be put some more action and be a bit more realistic. Some of the reasons this movie is good to go to if your are studying volcano's is because they're is plenty of volcanic words such as pyroctast which is a ash cloud.",Dante's Peak
214,lol-marcolol,Amaze-balls but unrealistic at times,8,23 April 2013,"We watched this movie in our Geography class and it was certainly worth watching.The Strengths of the movie would be the special effects of the Pyroclastic cloud and lava, the plot was very tense at times making us want to watch on and the cast were very good.The weaknesses of the movie though was that it was unrealistic at times, like, it lava was coming through your house, you would pretty much die by the heat etc. The Love relationship between Harry and Rachel didn't really go anywhere.Overall i though it was a very good film and would recommend to anyone studying volcanoes.",Dante's Peak
215,iiorangebubbles,Great effects from a 16 Years Old Movie!!,7,23 April 2013,"I liked this movie and I think it had many strengths but also some weaknesses. The effects were usually fantastic, especially considering that the movie was made 16 years ago. The movie followed a good storyline but I found that it was too predictable (e.g Harry was right about the volcano, although there was no proof.) Many parts of the movie were unrealistic like when the boat eroded away so quickly that Ruth had to sacrifice herself to get it across the river but their dog had somehow got across with no problems. I enjoyed how this movie had romance and occasional humor (coffee scene), after watching Harry's girlfriend's tragic death I was pleased the movie ended happily.Danté's Peak helped me understand more about volcanoes although I feel they could have added more detail/attention to this aspect of the movie.Overall I enjoyed this movie. I feel it educated and entertained me from start to finish.",Dante's Peak
216,eyalcinkaya949,Volcanos of awesomness!!!!,8,24 April 2013,"I though this movie was really good! It was full of suspense at the start and end. There was some gory scenes like broken bones, blood etc. This was a bad point because my friends are squeamish. The best part of the movie was the end, when the volcano started erupting because I love action. There was a lot of people at risk during the eruption, pyroclastic clouds and the lava, there was also a dead couple floating in the Hot Spring. I think overall they could have added more action, less love and more humour otherwise this movie was brilliant! Pierce Brosnan as Harry Dalton and Linda Hamilton as Rachel Wando both developed a good bond throughout the movie and ended it with a romantic kiss. Harry Dalton is an expert vulcanologist that tries to persuade his work partners that there is something going on and the town has to be put on alert but Paul (boss) refuses to do so until there is more information and mother have a massive part in the movie although Ruth (mother) has her leg burnt off and she dies I would recommend this movie to teenagers and action movie lovers!",Dante's Peak

This movie is partly love story, when Harry and Rachel get together and partly action with very tense music. This movie is mostly a very realistic movie with details including acid burning Ruth's (the grandmother) legs and rising fish to the top of the river. Also, helicopters being taken down by ash clouds choking its engine. There are also very unrealistic features for example, when harry drives over lava, that is not possible as tyre's would burn. They send a 'Spider' camera down the crater of the volcano which lets the volcanologists see if any activity is present. Pyroclastic bombs also star in the movie, they are rocks spewed out from the volcano when it erupts in the movie.",Dante's Peak

When his colleagues doubt his theories, Dalton enlists the aid of the town's mayor Rachel Wando, who though skeptical at first, comes to believe his theory that the long-dormant mountain is about to become a ragingly destructive volcano. With the earth's clock racing against him, Dalton must defy the orders of his superiors, defeat the demons from his own tragic past, and together with Wando, convince an unbelieving populace that the imminent danger before the towering mountain known as Dante's Peak unleashes its fury.",Dante's Peak
221,nwalker760,Excellent and Scienctific! :),8,25 March 2014,"Dantê's Peak was a very entertaining and factual film. It uses science and Vulcanology to enhance the movie. It uses actual Equipment like seismometers to detect changes in the earths crust. It also used a robot to go were it is too dangerous for a person to go. They also mention pyroclastic bombs and pyroclastic clouds emerging from the volcano. They also used a distress beacon to help locate them when they were stuck in the mine. they also tested the acidity of the lake which was very high, so high in fact that one of the characters dies in the lake. Overall I think the movie was very well made, with its' characters and script it makes a very enjoyable and intellectual movie to watch. Well done Roger Donaldson.",Dante's Peak
222,smccune733,This movie will make you hang off your seat with fear!!!,10,25 March 2014,"Film Genre: Action/Adventure (1997)(A Volcanic Disaster Movie)Starring: Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton Writer: Leslie Bohem Director: Roger DonaldsonStory Summary:Dr.Harry Dalton, a vulcanologist is sent by his boss to investigate volcanic activity in the small town of Dante's Peak, Washington, which is situated beside a volcano. After some preliminary research, Harry tells the town's major, Rachel Nando that the town should begin evacuation plans as he predicts imminent catastrophe. His boss, however and the local councillors are too cautious and do not want to scare investors away from the community so they call off the evacuation, insisting there is no need to panic - Disaster then strikes - the volcano erupts.My Opinion:The movie 'Dante's Peak' dramatises some real world concerns faced by communities which are located near active volcanoes.I thoroughly enjoyed Dante's Peak and believe that it is a great movie. The tension in the movie builds up very slowly with the two main characters, Harry and Rachel who develop a deep connection for each other and desperately fight for their own survival and the survival of others in the town.I thought it was an amazing action-packed thriller, which was full of excellent special effects. The plot is short and simple but there are so many special effects and drama that make it both very entertaining and a frightening suspense. The dramatic tension gradually increases as the volcano shows more signs of activity and eventually erupts and devastates the town.Overall, the movie is very realistic in that scientists, in many cases can anticipate volcanic eruptions. Harry Dalton was a acting USGS scientist (U.S. Geological Survey) scientist who do study and correctly predict in advance eruptions in real life.In many respects the movie's depiction of the enormous power unleashed during the eruption, the production of prognostic flows, clouds of volcanic ash and debris were very close to real life. However, lava flows tend to be thick and slow moving unlike the movie version!Volcanic ash clouds threatening the helicopters in the movie again is common in real life and the temperature change of the hot springs again is true to life, however it tends to build up more gradually. In the movie the town's water supply became contaminated when the volcano became restless and carbon dioxide killed the trees and wildlife – again this can happen in real – life but just more slowly!There is total chaos and everyone tries to escape at the same time and the excitement begins.The fight for survival is very gripping and the devastation is powerful.I felt extremely sad and very close to tears as the grandmother, Rachel's ex mother in law took the decision to die in the hot acid to save her grandchildren by pulling in the boat. I thought that this was horrific for the children to witness and I would not like to have been in such a position myself.The film has a geographically accurate basis, with a few exaggerations to achieve success. The opening scenes deal with real volcanoes and real science so it is very true to life. The images and sound quality are all excellent. I would thoroughly recommend this film to both teenagers and adults who are interested in romance, action and thrilling adventure.Stuart McCune",Dante's Peak
223,hhaslem724,Dante's Peak is an excellent movie,10,25 March 2014,"Dante's Peak is a very educational and interesting movie. The movie is filed with realistic facts and images. The characters in the movie are very good and Harry who works with volcanoes, he also knows a lot about them, he warns the village about the volcano erupting. the plot in Dante's Peak is very well written and structured and the plot is also believable. When the volcano erupts it causes chaos in the village and everybody is evacuated from their homes. The ash, lava and pyroclastic clouds are very believable. all the way through Dante's Peak it is filled with facts to do with volcanoes. It is a brilliant movie that from the very beginning shows and explains a lot about volcanoes and how they work. I would recommend this movie to a friend.",Dante's Peak
224,rgibson721,Be ready for an explosion of excitement!!,7,26 March 2014,"Dante's Peak was an Exciting and breath taking look into how a volcano erupts and the signs of eruption before it explodes. I really enjoyed watching this movie as it made you constantly think about what could go wrong next, This movie had an exciting take to the more scientific area of volcanoes, by introducing us to the robot that detects gas and also has a camera called 'spider-legs'. Dante's Peak has an interesting style, because while there was constant drama with the volcanic eruption, they made a romance occur between the town's Mayor, Rachel and a volcanic specialist, Harry. This gave the movie a really good story line, as whilst we seen everything about the eruption, you just wanted Rachel, Harry and Rachels two children to survive. I think most of the features were created very realistically , as the Pyroclastic cloud and bombs seemed so real, though I think the mudslide was the most unrealistic part. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to learn more about volcanoes, but also be kept on they're toes with excitement.",Dante's Peak
225,rnelson768-956-313795,Non-stop action movie,8,26 March 2014,"We watched Dante's Peak in Geography as part of our volcanoes study. Dante's Peak is a very well structured movie and is very scientifically correct, it is a very educational movie. The main characters are Harry(Pierce Brosnan), Rachel(Linda Hamilton), Ruth (Elizabeth Hoffman). Rachel has two kids, Lauren and Graham. Rachel is the mayor of Dante's Peak and Harry is a vulcanologist, who has been called to Dante's Peak to investigate unusual volcanic activity with his company. Throughout the movie a romance develops between Harry and Rachel. They sent a robot,""Spiderlegs"" up to the mountain,""Spiderlegs"" was a very interesting robot with many scientific uses, it had a camera which was linked to the comany's office and collected important information. There was a seismometer to detect volcanic activity.On the helicopter, there was a gas detector looking for SO2(sulphur dioxide). The volcano eruption happened at the sports ground. The Volcanic eruption was very realistic as it had all the features of a volcanic eruption, there was ash cloud, gas, pyroclastic bombs and pyroclastic cloud, this made the volcanic eruption seem very real. After the volcanic eruption happened a mud flow was formed due to there being snow,ice and ash. In some scenes this movie was very unrealistic, when Elizabeth got into the river, I don't think it would have turned to acid so quickly and when the volcano hit Elizabeth's house, they would have been killed instantly. I thought it was very unrealistic when they drove over the burning ash,the rubber of the tyre would have burnt straight away.Overall, I think this movie is very interesting and the scientific information is correct.",Dante's Peak
226,nhoy540,The volcano isn't so dormant after all!!,8,26 March 2014,"I think that Dante's Peak is a very good educational and scientific movie. The main characters in this movie are 'Harry' played by Pierce Brosnan, 'Rachel' played by Linda Hamilton and 'Ruth' played by Elizabeth Hoffman. Harry is a vulcanologist who lost his wife years before due to a pyroclastic bomb. Harry has been sent to Dante's Peak to investigate unusual seismic activity. When he is out with Rachel and her two kids he finds two dead bodies in the hot spring. He tests the water down at the lake and realises that it is very acidic. Rachel is the mayor of Dante's Peak and Harry tells her to alert the community as he thinks the dormant volcano is going to wake up. As harry and Rachel are discussing the matter, Harrys boss Paul, walks in and tells Rachel not to alert the community as there isn't enough evidence, but later on that night, Harry discovers the tap water is coming out brown!. The community are going to be alerted! Harry and his work partners go up to the volcano with 'spider legs' the robot that has a camera attached to it. It also has a gas detector on it just like the helicopter did, detecting for SO2 (Sulphur Dioxide). Harry and Rachel have a warm relationship that grows throughout the movie. My favourite part of the movie was the end of it when the volcano erupted with a pyroclastic cloud and lava, putting a lot of people at risk. I loved the action at the end of the movie but there were some unrealistic parts during it as well. Whenever Harry, Rachel and Rachel's two kids were trying to leave Dante's Peak, Harry drove over lava and the tyres didn't burn and also when the lava came through Ruth's house they would have died due to the heat. Altogether I enjoyed this movie and I think it is very educational with a great plot.",Dante's Peak

There was a good build up throughout the movie, getting to know the characters and seeing their relationships develop before disaster happens.I am currently learning about volcanoes so Dante's Peak was very interesting and helped me understand more about volcanoes and what actually happens. There were scenes in the movie that were realistic, like the pyroclastic clouds and lava, although there were some unrealistic features too. For example, when Harry the vulcanologist drives over a lava flow successfully. This could not be possible as the tyres would melt and the car would probably go on fire. The unrealistic features kind of ruined the movie, but brought in a lot of action which made it more enjoyable.I love how the movie was based on a love story between Harry and Rachel (Dante's Peak mayor) but was also filled with lots of action. I would love to see what happens next in the movie and i recommend Dante's Peak to anyone who loves movies with love, disaster and lots of action!",Dante's Peak
228,nenglish840,good movie :),9,25 March 2014,"The movie in my opinion was very good. The movie had a really good start. It starts off years ago with harry and his girlfriend Marianne but she got killed by pyroclastic bomb falling on her head. This shows the audience how dangerous eruptions are.It then brings the movie forward where unusual activity in the town of Dante's peak and harry is sent to investigate it because he is a volcano expert and that is why he was at the eruption years ago. When he gets to Dante's peak he meets the mayor Rachel and her two children they take a tour around the small town the children decide to let harry see the towns small peak that gives harry his evidence they find two dead bodies from a couple that has jumped into the spring and has been burned alive by the acids in the lava (mantle).harry tries to get his boss to reconsider about putting the town on alarm but he said the town would be at risk for tourist population decrease if the dormant volcano didn't erupt.The team of experts find information that could change this town forever and it does when the volcano erupts Harry, Rachel love grows stronger and the children and them go through many experiences such as crossing a lava river or nearly sinking in a river full of acid most of these movie features look realistic but the acid river didn't seem realistic as the boat wouldn't corrode as quickly as it did. Volcano features where all realistic from the ash cloud to the mud flow and overall I would recommend the movie to a friend or someone that is in my age group (14-15) as it was really educational but was really interesting in my opinion.",Dante's Peak

Throughout the movie it seemed to take the tale of being a romantic type as the two characters got along rather well. The robot 'spiderlegs' was quite interesting because it seemed to have many uses, to videoing and collecting information, it seemed to me, to be one of the more realistic parts and therefore I enjoyed it more.The main characters in the movie are; Harry Dalton geologist at the United States.(Pierce Brosnan)Rachel Wando mayor of Dante's Peak and food and drink shop owner.(Linda Hamilton) Altogether, I really enjoyed the movie and watching it.

The plot was very interesting and the romance between Harry and Rachel, made it much more better to watch. the children in the movie were also very fun to watch as they were very lovable.The science was very realistic with the camera's showing the volcanic activity and the sulphur dioxide and the robot spider.

It also contained a robot which had spider legs, a gas detector and a camera on it which they would use to check the volcano. The characters in the movie were also very good they played their roles well which made the movie even better. I liked it when the family were in some tense situations like when they were driving through the lava and when they were going through the lake these parts made the film all the more exciting and enjoyable.",Dante's Peak
232,apoots453,I was sitting on the edge of my seat through out the movie,8,25 March 2014,"I found Dante's Peak a very exciting, entertaining and interesting movie. I was on the edge of my seat through out the movie.In school I am studying volcanoes and earthquakes and this movie made me really understand what it must be like to in the situation of an eruption of a volcano. Dante's Peak also helped me to understand the science of volcanoes and how vulcanologist's can use different equipment like a robot called Spider legs Who can go down further into the volcano where it is not safe for humans . They also used a gas detector to identify what gas the the volcano was producing and a seismometer to predict when the volcano would erupt. It also taught me that a volcano can erupt at any time.I liked the part at the end when the the volcano erupted, there was a lot of action when Harry the vulcanologist and Rachel the mayor of Dante's Peak and her children were tyring to escape from the flowing lava and the ash cloud. They then drove into the mine to escape and got stuck there because the rock s all came crumbling down. They were eventually rescued a couple of days later, which was a reviling moment and a happy romantic moment because Harry and Rachel kissed!I sometimes found the movie unrealistic for example when Grahm and Lauren(Rachel's kids)drove up the mountain by themselves even though they are children. The lava also looked unrealistic and the lake had so much acid in it, it was eating into the boat. I think these parts were exaggerated. But overall I enjoyed the movie!",Dante's Peak

I found it interesting, exciting, the movie was realistic in most parts but the lava was unrealistic.The genre of this movie was romance, it was a really good believable story. The volcano robot (spiderlegs)was really good, it was made by NASA in the USA, this is part was very good.The ash clouds were amazingly created and were realistic. The mud flow (snow-ice-ash) were very good. The volcanic bombs (pyroclastic bomb) were well create, the earthquake was good. The seismometer to detect earthquakes was good. They could have made the part when the grandma jumped into the acid lake a bit more realistic. The acid lake was OK, but would the lake actually be that strong it would erode the boat away so quickly? In my opinion i would recommend this movie to friends etc.",Dante's Peak

The movie is definitely full of cliff-hangers. It is also very helpful as we are learning about volcanoes in class at the minute. It made it a lot more realistic and gave me a better idea of what it would be like.The characters including Harry, Rachel and the volcanic activity team all made the film seem like the disastrous volcanoes eruption was happening in real life.The film included lots of true scientific facts and machinery like the spiderlegs and the pyroclastic bombs. It was really helpful to see the actual eruption with the mudslide caused by the snow and ice, the ash cloud/ pyroclastic cloud and the earthquakes which they used a seismometer to detect.The downsides of the film were that at some points it was very unrealistic. I thought it was unrealistic when Harry tried to drive away from the pyroclastic cloud as pyroclastic clouds travel at 450mph and they couldn't be outrun by a pickup truck with no tyres. Other unrealistic scenes of the film included the motor boat in the acid lake, the children driving the truck up the mountain and surviving, the dog and Harry and the rest of the family trying to drive over 1000°c hot lava.There could have been more detail at the end of the film like a fishing trip with the children.Overall I really enjoyed the film and I thought it was thrilling but educational at the same time. I would definitely recommend to anyone but especially anyone learning about volcanoes.",Dante's Peak
235,dlyttle662,Enjoyed the film but some parts were unrealistic.,7,26 March 2014,"From the beginning of the movie I was interested in what would happen. I thought the beginning of Dante's Peak was really good, I liked that the beginning, when the main character, Harry's wife was killed by a pyroclastic bomb, gave the viewers an insight to why Harry was very cautious about volcanoes even if they were dormant for many years.I thought the relationship between the two main-characters, Harry and Rachel, was very believable, and as the movie went they got closer and closer.I didn't think when the volcano erupted that it was very realistic. Near the end of the film when Harry, Rachel and the two kids tried to drive through the lava, the tyres didn't melt. And whenever they sailed through the lake, I didn't think it was possible for the lake to become acidic and dissolve the boat.",Dante's Peak
236,dranson656,Blew me away but not 100% right,7,25 March 2014,I watched this movie in my geography class in school and it was very interesting and it was to help us on our topic of earthquakes and volcanoes.The movie has a lot of characters like the mayor the children and harry also the research team.Harry was from the land survey and was worried that the volcano was going to erupt so they set up a seismometer to see if the volcano is going to erupt.They also flew in a helicopter to see if there was any sulphur gas which was one of the signs the volcano was going to erupt.when it erupted it released a pyroclastic cloud with pyroclastic bombs fling around in side it some parts of this movie are realistic and some are not real at all.I am not going to spoil any more just go and watch this movie for the rest of the detail.director:Roger Donaldson,Dante's Peak
237,jferguson760,pyroclastic mayhem,9,25 March 2014,"I enjoyed Dantes peak, the build up and eruption of the volcano were realistic, it showed me all the different signs that a volcano is a bout to erupt, e.g the trees dying on up the volcano, squirrels dying and the the large amount of sulphur. The equipment they were using was realistic as well e.g spiderlegs-robot, Gas detector hung underneath the helicopter and the computer simulation of the prediction that the whole top of the volcano would blow. I enjoyed watching the eruption taking place with all the ash clouds at the start and the pyroclastic bombs. A side effect during the eruption was the large amount of snow and ice melting which mixed with ash to form mudslides, and destroyed the only bridge out of the town. This left Harry (The vulcanologist first at the scene) and the mayors family stranded in the small town... NO MORE SPOLILERS!!!! On the whole i thought it was factual and enjoyable.",Dante's Peak
238,csmiley111,Amazing movie!!!,7,26 March 2014,"I really enjoyed this film, it was spectacular. I thought that that most of the film was very realistic, although some parts were a little unbelievable. When Harry, Ruth and the family get into the acidic lake, I do not think that it would be so harmful as to eat through the metal. I thought that the volcanic eruption was very realistic, especially the pyroclastic cloud at the beginning of the eruption. My favourite part of the film was when Ruth saved her family and Harry from the acidic lake. My favourite character in the film was Harry because I thought that he was very enthusiastic during playing his role. In conclusion all in all I thought that Dante's Peak was a great film and had some very interesting facts included throughout.",Dante's Peak
239,tpriestley106-957-266892,Super cool amazing thing!!!!!!!!!!,8,26 March 2014,"Dante's Peak was very exciting from the start because it had an action scene first. I thought the movie was realistic in most places for example the science aspect because they used real scientific equipment, like the spider robot the sulphur testing, the size monitor for testing the vibrations and the gas tester and also the camera on the robot. The eruption was realistic in places like the pyroclastic cloud, the ash cloud, the volcanic bombs, the mud flow and the earthquake. The unrealistic part of the eruption was the lava, I thought this was unrealistic because Harry was able to drive across it and only one tire caught fire, I also thought it looked unrealistic. Over all I thought this was a good movie and very realistic in places. I thought the actors and Actresses performed well, Harry especially done a convincing performance.",Dante's Peak
240,smartin663-957-706882,Dantes Peak Review :)))))),8,26 March 2014,"i thought Dantes Peak was an interesting and action-packed film.The plot was very good and the romance between mayor and the vulcanologist added to the movie and made it all the better to watch. Most characters in the movie were very lovable like the mayors daughter and son. Other characters quickly became very annoying like the vulcanologist's boss who would listen to him about the warnings of the dormant volcano. The science in the movie was was very clever with the volcano robot and the CCTV cameras showing the volcanic activity. The sulphur dioxide was accurate as a volcano would show toxic activity before it would erupt. the volcanic eruption itself was very accurate as it did even show the mud slide of ash,ice and snow after the first eruption. Even before the eruption it showed the earthquakes and measured them with the seismometer. The pyroclastic cloud and bombs made the volcanic eruption all the more realistic.",Dante's Peak
241,mchambers063-957-464224,sheep-man review,7,26 March 2014,"From the beginning I enjoyed it because of Harry's wife being killed by the Pyroclastic bomb. This insight helps the viewers understand why Harry is so determined to save all of the people from the volcano. In some bits of the movie it was very unrealistic, such as the bit when Harry was able to drive his pickup truck through red hot lava and the wheels didn't even melt never mind it not blowing up. I thought Harry and Rachel's relationship was unrealistic too because they just suddenly feel in love when they first seen each other. I loved the bone that you could see that was pocking out of Harry's arm after he had broke it in the car. The science was right because they had a size-o-meter, spider legs robot and the gas detector was all correct.",Dante's Peak

So Harry rushes to Paul and shows him the water.Then Paul,Rachel,Harry and the crew go to the school gym and have a meeting with the town and tell them to be ready to have to go at any time. Rachel's kids go up the mountain to get their granny so harry and Rachel have to go up while the volcano is going off and the go into the mine it collapses and harry turns on a beacon and help comes they all escape.",Dante's Peak
243,rneill452,Overall i think Dante's Peak was a vey good and realistic movie.,7,31 March 2014,"The realistic parts in this movie includes the giant ash cloud which comes out of the volcano looked very realistic, also the volcanic bombs also looked very real when they were fired at the town, the lava flow was also quite good and realistic but you could still see it was fake but it was still quite good and also the Spider developed by NASA was also very good and realistic.Some unrealistic parts of the movie are when the car drove over the lava but was able to drive fine after it but in real life the lava would of melted the metal rims and the tyres would have burst and another one is when Harry is using his shirt to push the boat the acidic water would have spashed up onto his arms like when the granny jumped into the water her legs and arms were burnt of her.Characters: Harry-VolcomolisistRachel-Town mayor-Business ownerPaul-US Geographical study-Harry's boss Harry and Rachel have a bit of a romance going on and Harry and Paul have a bit of conflict about if the volcano will explode.",Dante's Peak
244,bferguson673,Dante's Peak,1,27 March 2014,"I didn't like Dante's Peak for many reasons,I thought it was unappealing to my age group and was very boring until the last half hour of the movie. The role played for Harry in Dante's Peak was a very bad choice , the character showed no emotion throughout the movie. Rachel's character and her two kids were pretty good roles they were the ones fill my satisfaction throughout the film. The movies was quite unrealistic in my eyes, I have never seen a car drive over a 1000 degrees liquid, have you? Some of the special effects over long distances of land were very unbelievably bad. An example of this is a scene were ash clouds swept over the forest. Overall I rate this movie 1/5 stars for its bad character roles, terrible script and woeful special effects.",Dante's Peak
245,amckinstry065,OK movie,7,31 March 2014,"The main characters in the story were, Harry who was a vulcanologist, Rachel who was the town mayor and also owned her own business and Paul who was the USGS boss. Some of the scenes where realistic and some unrealistic. The car drives over the lava which is over 1000 Celsius which would be impossible because the tyres would melt. One of the realistic scenes is the acid in the water and the explosive ash cloud from the volcano. The scientific parts of the movie was ash clouds, volcanic bombs , gas such as sulphur dioxide . In my opinion the movie was OK not the best because of some scenes.i would advise people to give the movie a go because it i quite educating and it has some exciting thrills",Dante's Peak
246,oferris766,this movie is not realistic,1,31 March 2014,"I really think Dante's peak is an awful movie as we are learning about volcanoes in school and this is very bad way to my learning. there was parts in the movie that on my opinion opinionated as realistic or non-realistic. in my opinion there was some realistic facts. some are; explosive ash clouds, lava flow, school gym earthquake, the coloured water and the acid rain, there are also some special effects which i thought were not realistic.

249,joannebranker,Dantes Peak Review,6,1 April 2014,"Dantes peak is a movie about a volcano that explodes and destroys a small town at the bottom of it. it is an a very interesting movie and compared to any other movies it id very realistic, but there is still stuff that isn't that real. the main character is called Harry Dalton (played by Pierce Brosnan) and he is a volcanic expert. The reason why it is so realistic is because of the stuff that comes out of the volcano such as the ash clouds and the gas. When they were checking the volcano for an volcanic eruption they used special robots called spiderlegs. This equipment is very technical and is used for going down into the volcano when it is too dangerous for any human beings. All in all i think this movie is one of the most realistic movies I have ever seen.",Dante's Peak
250,missladybird-963-654366,Realistic and entertaining,7,1 April 2014,"I thought Dante's Peak was very realistic as a lot of what we are learning in school about volcanoes and earthquakes was mentioned or shown. I thought it was exciting and fun to watch and sometimes scary and I liked this combination of genres. The special effects were really good and the scientific side was interesting when watching the explosions, pyroclastic clouds and bombs and the lava. The plot had a few nice twists and the characters were believable and easy to get to know. My favourite part of the movie was the suspenseful pyroclastic cloud as it was both realistic and exciting. I liked the movie overall and would recommend it to a friend because the science was there, the excitement was there , the good plot was there and lastly it was very believable.",Dante's Peak
251,ltait438,A review on Dantes Peak,7,17 November 2014,"I am writing a review on Dante's Peak as I have recently watched it and found it very interesting. The main character is Harry. His girlfriend is called Rachael who was the town mayor. She has two children called Graham and Lauren. There was a little old granny called Ruth but she sadly died in acid water in a lake. There was also a man called Paul and he was the team leader.There was lots of equipment used in Dante's Peak. Some of them where the E. L. f from NASA, a robot spider with 8 legs, video camera, audio, heat sensor, gas detector and a buried seismometer which had vibrations.Some of the video had scenes which where more real than others. One of which was the volcano it was very real looking and so was the giant ash cloud. I personally didn't think that the truck on the lava was very life like because in a real situation you couldn't just drive over it. For example the wheels would burst. I also thought that the pyroclastic cloud was very well done as it looked so real as it came after the characters in the car.The film had loads of emotions the main ones where horror and happiness. Some other emotions through out the whole movie where words like sad, relieved, happy, scared, worried and they might of have felt guilty like when they left Ruth on her own when she died. Over all I really enjoyed watching this movie and I recommend it to anyone who wants to watch it.",Dante's Peak
252,tgraham653,Dante's Peak,10,13 November 2014,"I am writing a review for Dante's Peak. Firstly I am going to introduce you to the characters. There is Harry who is the main man, Rachel-Mayor of Dante's Peak, her mum Ruth and her kids. Then lastly Paul who is the Geology team leader (U.S.G.S). The film starts off with Harry and his girlfriend in a jeep, driving speedily away from an erupting volcano. Sadly a volcanic bomb lands on top of the jeep and hits her on the head. Four years after the tragic event Harry is sent to Dante's Peak to check for an Eruption. This is when Harry first meets Rachel and the kids. When Harry first sees the volcano he is sure it is going to erupt very soon. However his boss Paul doesn't want a big panic over nothing and keeps calm as he thinks there is not going to be an eruption. Harry is right the volcano erupts and destroys the town and rips it to pieces and Harry, Rachel, the kids and Ruth are still very close to the volcano. As they try to save themselves form the volcano they come across a lot of challenges to escape the town of Dante's Peak. My opinion of this film is that it was very interesting to watch and sometimes very addictive form the very start. I would certainly recommend it to anyone that loves action films, as this film is very action packed and full of surprises. I would like to finish off by rating this film a 10/10.",Dante's Peak
253,dbernardi048,Dante's Peak Review,10,12 November 2014,"I am writing a review about Dante's Peak. This movie suited me because it is action packed, thrilling and exciting. The movie linked into the topic which I am doing in school.The plot of the film is that Harry (the main character) is a volcanologist and he is sent to Dante's Peak on holiday. When he sees and notices key fetchers like (e.g. hot springs bubbling, C2O rising and plants/ animals are died).The main characters are Harry (volcanologist), Rachel (Mother of Graim and Loran), Ruth (grandmother) and Paula good friends of Harry. He is also a volcanologist.The equipment in the movie includes seismometer which monitors vibrations, a robot called ""spider"" because it has 6 legs and a camera. There was a tracker which is called E.L.F. Which was given to Paul's team by N.A.S.A. In my opinion Dante's Peak is an excellent movie it is an amazing example of a volcano erupting. I feel not all of the movie was related to what would happen in some of the same of the situation which Harry and Rachel family got into e.g. car driving over lava. Over all a great movie.",Dante's Peak
254,bjamison538,"A very good, interesting movie",9,12 November 2014,"I recently watched Dante's Peak. It was a good movie. A volcanologist called Harry and his girlfriend were trying to get away from a volcano. Suddenly a pyroclast hit her in the head and killed her. The movie then fasts forward a few years were Harry is going to Dante's Peak. It is a popular holiday destination. He finds the out the volcano could erupt any moment and tells the mayor (Rachel) to considerate a possible evacuation. She believes him but when he tells his boss Paul, he disagrees and tells him to keep quiet. Then it erupts. Most people make it out but Paul doesn't. When Harry, Rachel and her children find out there trapped, they drive flat out down the mines. The mine then collapses but everyone gets rescued. Also, the realism isn't rite. There is a scene were Harry drives over lava and makes it out?I rate this movie 9/10 as its very interesting but the realism isn't rite. :)",Dante's Peak
255,ccully775,Dante's Peak,8,9 November 2014,"The main characters in this movie are Harry,Rachel,Ruth and Paul. In th e movie Harry is a vulcanologist who's girlfriend was killed by a volcano .Harry was then sent to Dante's Peak due to some volcanic activity. Harry thinks there will be an eruption but Paul (Harry's boss) doesn't. They call a meeting to evacuate the city. During the meeting the eruption happened. There was mass destruction and havoc in the city. The movie is quite believable but there are a few mistakes such as the acid lake and the take on lava. In the movie they used real equipment such as a Seismometer, Seismograph, E.L.F and a Spider Robot with eight legs that had a camera on it which showed any activity in the volcano because it was to dangerous for any human to go up into a volcano.They also use scientific information such as pyroclast, pyroclast cloud, ash, lava, dust and a cone.

256,bcoburn850,Dantes Peak,8,12 November 2014,"This is a review of the movie Dante's Peak I recently watched. Dante's Peak is a movie based on a volcano waiting to erupt. The equipment they used in the movie. For a start there is a Robotic ""Spider"" with 8 legs basically they use the robot to go into dangerous areas to test if there is anything dangerous like gas which will harm the people. The Robot has equipped to its inventory a video camera to record the footage that the Robot is seeing. It also has equipped to it Audio so that the people can hear what is going on around the Robot. I think the Robot is a good safe idea for the armed forces or any scientists to use. I am now going to talk about the scientific information which is used in this film. The people who study volcanoes and sees if it is dormant or active see when it is going to erupt is called a Volcanologist. The rocks which come flying out of the volcano are called Volcanic Bombs or the real name for them are called pyroclasts made up with Ash and Dust which clogs up aeroplane engines and car engines. The big cloud which comes out of the volcano is called a pyroclastic cloud which crushes everything in its way. The stuff which comes running down the side of the volcano is called lava which is thousands of degrees hot. Overall it is a really good fantastic movie. Its really educational for geography as my class in school watched it for the topic volcanoes and earthquakes. By Brandon Coburn",Dante's Peak
257,charper622,Dantes peak review,7,13 November 2014,"This is a review of the movie Dante's Peak I recently watched. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and will now be writing a review on it. I will start with how real I felt the movie was to real life. I don't believe that any vehicle could drive over lava because it would obviously melt the tyres and burn a hole in the petrol tank and that would explode the whole truck but in the movie there was a scene where the truck drove over the lava and was stationary on the lava for at least ten seconds, I think that is defiantly enough time for the lava to melt the petrol tank and that would result in the whole truck exploding. Overall I think the movie is not that realistic. This movie is good for people around my age in third year because we learn a lot about volcanoes in geography and this movie explains what happens when volcanoes explode, how they explode and the damage and destruction caused by a volcano that erupts. The movie is very enjoyable and is an easy way to teach and learn about volcanoes. In this movie you don't just learn about volcanoes but also all the equipment used to tell whether the volcano is active and likely to explode. Overall I think the movie is very good and explains things in a more fun way than being taught by a teacher, I would give this movie a 4 out of 5 star rating.",Dante's Peak

There also mum with 2 children. the theme is set in a town in front of a volcano.Dante's peak the film can be full of action at some times they used real equipment e.g. spider a 8 legged robot that goes into dangerous bits of an volcano e.g. inside the top of a volcano there also a machine called an elf as well Harry warns the mayor that the volcano is going to blow and kill all the locals but the other guy says the volcano is OK and to stop worrying the locals in the end the volcano erupts and all the locals try an escape but Harry try and helps Ruth's Family they go and collect Ruth when they get out to collect her the car catches fire from the lava so they have to get a boat into the acid water but the boat is metal so when they get half way the boat starts to sink the acid water nearly sank the whole boat but Ruth jumps out and brings the boat into the side.

The Scientific information in this movie is relatively good for example the pyroclastic bombs, the ash and the acid lake. The equipment used in this movie is exrtremly good like the E.L.F from NASA and the seismometer that they dug into the ground to record vibrations from the volcano to predict when the volcano is about to blow.The plot is an interesting one with Harry's Gf getting killed at the start of the movie because of a pyroclastic bomb. Then he goes to work on Dantes' Peak and then it blows. Rcahels kids run away up the mountation to collect their Grandmother and then then her grandmothers dog runs away. The realism is quite good like the acid lake and the ash, but the tyres on the lava is not very real because the tyres would burn off.It was very interesting but i wouldn't watch it again.",Dante's Peak

261,acrawford725,review,8,19 November 2014,"I am a year 10 pupil who just watched Dante's peak. I thought it was really good because it shows how a real volcano would erupt. It helped me understand how it would happen. The plot goes like this Harry who is a geologist is at another volcano eruption in Central America. He is going to collect his girlfriend. When he collects his girlfriend He drives away but after he gets further down the road his girlfriend gets hit by a pyroclastic blow which kills her. The next scene is where it brings us to modern-day where harry is sent to Dante's peak to look at a possible eruption. Harry thinks there is going to be an eruption but his boss Paul doesn't but Harry was right and there is an eruption. Harry then escapes with the mayor of Dante's peak and also her two children. Then there is a second eruption but Harry, Rachel and her two kids are in an old mine. Then soon after Harry uses the E.L.F to be located and they are rescued safe and well. The equipment they use is very expensive like the E.L.F this was on the side of The Spider. A robot with 8 legs that went into places which was too dangerous for Harry it also had a video camera and heat sensors. The characters in the movie fitted well with the story here is a list of them Harry –A geologist . Rachel-Mayor of Dante's Peak and mum of two kids. Ruth-Granny and mother in law. Kids-Graham and Lauren. Paul-Geology team leader. I thought that some bits of the movie was nor realistic for example the two people who were boiled to death they would have had time to get out because it would have not heated up instantly .when harry drove on top of the lava the car would have exploded but they are the only things that are bad about it.

Dante has signs of eruption and these people have to try and figure out when it will erupt and evacuate the area but it is too late to evacuate. The main characters in the movie are called henry, Rachel, Ruth, graham, Lauren and Paul. Henry is a geologist who's girlfriend died from pyroclast after a volcano erupted. Rachel is the mayor of the town who starts to date henry, Ruth is the granny, Kids are graham and Lauren who are Rachel's kids and Paul is the geology team leader. The realism in this movie is fake. Henry drives a truck through lava and the truck didn't blow up, Ruth jumped into an acid lake and lost her foot and she died, there were a couple of bathers who were boiled to death.

Harry the main character is a volcanologist, a few years ago his girlfriend died in a volcanic eruption while trying to get away.Harry works in the USGS with his boss Paul and the staff, Harry is sent into a nearby village to work on a volcano that they think might erupt. Harry goes with the major, Rachel, and her children to her mother in law, Ruth, for Harry to inspect the wild life around the volcano. Ruth offered to go swimming in the springs with the kids, when they get there they walk down the path and they spot squirrels and trees burnt down, later on they go for a swim and Harry notices the spring is boiling while the boy runs to jump in to the spring Harry jumps and catches the boy. When they go back to the village he tells the major to put the town on alert so they have a meeting to see what they should do, but Harry's boss comes and stops the commotion. The next day they go up the volcano and put a machine called a spider up for safety but the spider breaks and one of his colleagues go to try and fix it but when he was doing that an earth tremor breaks some rocks which fall on him and break his leg. A town meeting is announced and puts the town on alert, but when the meeting is still on an earthquake comes and everyone goes crazy. Harry and the major go and evacuate, but when they go to get the kids, they had already left to see her mother in law. When they get to the mother in laws house they try to escape but the road is blocked by lava so they drive through it. After they get through the lava they go on a boat across the lake to get away from the lava. When they were sailing the acid in the water burns the metal boat and the motor on the boat was also eaten away by the acid. So the mother in law gets out and pushes the boat to save them by getting them to the other side. As they walk through the ash, the mother in law stops and dies because of the wounds from the acid in the water. They find a car and drive back to the village and get a device called an elf, which is a transmitter. Harry runs back to the car and an ash cloud pushes towards them. They get into an abandoned mine shaft to get away from the ash cloud. As they walk deeper into the mine Harry goes back to get the elf as the elf is a transmitter which lets the USGS know they have survived. So they can be saved.I found the movie Dante's Peak interesting. The characters where well played and my favourite was Harry. I would give it a 5/5",Dante's Peak

Finally they come to the hot springs when they arrive the springs are letting of some steam so the kids want to go for a swim but when graham was about to jump in harry stops him because he has noticed to dead bodies in the water! After making these discoveries Harry wants to put the town on alert and evacuate but when Harry is going to give the the word Paul from the U.S.G.S (Harrys boss) comes in and stops everything, he doesn't want to worry or panic the town because of the tourism.They take a helicopter up to the crater of the volcano and send a robot (spider) down into the volcano and when the robot is walking around as it is doing this it stops working so Barry does down to try and fix it but there is a small earthquake and Barry leg gets broken when rocks fall on him. Harry then goes to Rachel's house and as he is getting a drink he notices that the water is polluted. Harry calls a town meeting during the meeting a big earthquake starts and the town goes into panic. Harry, Rachel and the kids go up the mountain to get Ruth then the lava destroys her cabin but they get into a boat on the lake but the lake is completely acid now so it is harmful to the skin the boat breaks down so Ruth gets out into the lake and brings them to safety but because of the burns on her body she dies. the rest of them escape in a truck and drive over some less dangerous lava as this is happening the volcano is about to blow so they drive into the mine and are trapped in it but they have the E.L.F that sends out a message saying they are alive and then they are saved.My opinion on the film was i thought it was very realistic and accurate but in some parts it wasn't completely true e.g. when the lake turned to acid i think it happened to quickly. overall i liked the film and would recommend it to people of my age group.",Dante's Peak

The characters were good. The main characters was harry the valcaulogist (Pierce Branson) he was my favourite actor. The other actor were Rachel the major , owner of a coffee shop and mother of her 2 children Lauren and Graham. My second favourite character was granny Ruth, as she just seemed to be a legend and her wee dog Ruffy. It started of 4 years earlier when Harry was in central America with girlfriend a volcano explorer who got killed by a pyroclast killed her, it then came back to now, harry was sent to Dante's Peak to investigate. After investigating, Harry decided to put the town on alert. The boss said no and wouldn't put the town on alertthen the volcano erupted. Harry, Rachel the 2 kids and they dog all survived, Granny Ruth died jumping into boiling hot water to save all them! I loved this movie, it's one of the best movies I've watched.

The main characters are Harry vulcanologist – Pieuce Brasnon, Rachel Mayer, coffee shop owner- Linda Hamilton and Graham and Lauren the kids. Members of the U.S.G.S Paul-boss, Barry broke his leg +3 others. There also was a dog named Rocky, Fluffy or Ruffy? The plot of the story went like this Harry was in Central America with his G.F when a volcano erupts and a pyroclast hit her on the head and she dies. It then skips forward 4 years and he is told to go to danté's peak. This is when he calls an town meeting and wants to put the town on alert because of the volcano, just when Paul (Harry's boss) arrives and tells the people at the town meeting to go home and tells Harry to go on a vacation. The water then gets polluted by the sulphur dioxide. The U.S.G.S calls a town meeting the ground then starts shaking and the people panic and run over each other. Shortly after that the volcano erupts, the kids drive a pickup truck up the volcano to get their Granny, Harry and Rachel then follow. The Granny's house gets destroyed by lava. They have to go in a boat over the lake but the lake has turned to acid (I did not like this as the lake would not just turn to acids that fast) and the boat starts to skin. The engine of the boat dies so the Granny jumps out of the boat and pulls it through the water. They get out drive down the volcano into a mine get stuck turn on the E.L.F to get help. In the end they all survive apart from Paul the boss. All in I thought it was a great movies, could have been more lifelike. I liked the plot good characters the ending was all right",Dante's Peak
267,wgreda,Dante's Peak Review year 10,8,23 October 2015,"Recently in class we have watched Dante's Peak. I thought that it had some great parts to it and some horrific parts. The good parts in the movie were the one's when Harry was right about the eruption,and the last scene in the movie , i thought was great, when Harry, Rachel and her children are saved from the mine that they were stuck in after the volcanic eruption. The worst parts to the movie, i think were when Harry's elbow broke and the bone was sticking out and when the two people in the hot springs got acidified from the sulphur dioxide that got into the water. I didn't like these parts as i thought they were too gruesome, and too disgusting. From a geographical point of view, i thought that most of the parts of the movie were unrealistic, for example when the granny jumped out of the boat and disintegrated, i thought that was unrealistic because the lake would not have acidified in the space of a couple of hours. Overall i thought the movie was good, but it could have been better by making it more realistic and less gruesome.",Dante's Peak

I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone. In one scene it thought it was quite unrealistic. The plot of the movie was very accurate and detailed. The movie started off with the main character Harry who studied Volcanoes with his girlfriend. They were in Central America, the town they were staying at was below a volcano unfortunately the volcano erupted and a pyroclast killed his girlfriend by hitting her on the head. Paul (Harry's Boss) sends him to Dante's Peak. He meets the Mayor of the town (Rachel) and her two children (Lauren and Graham). Rachel takes Harry and the children up the mountain to investigate if the volcano is active or not. While they are up in the mountains the children discover two dead squirrels, Harry then finds two dead trees beside a river. The children decide that they want to go see their Grandmother, and she decides to take them for a swim in a hot spring. As they arrive and get ready to jump in they discover two dead hikers that have been burned while swimming in the hot spring. Harry decides to put the town on alert but Paul (his boss) refuses as it may affect money and tourism. U.S.G.S go into the crater with a helicopter and a robotic spider while they are up in the crater with the spider a small tremor occurs and one of Harry's colleagues falls and breaks his leg. Harry then notices that the tap water has turned orange/brown colour. The next day he decides to call a town meeting, during the meeting an earthquakes hits and everyone panics, soon after the earthquake the volcano erupts and everyone tries to escape. MAYHEM! Graham and Lauren drive to their Grandmothers house and she refused to come down from the mountain. Rachel and Harry go to save the children and their grandmother. They find a boat to travel down the river in as it would be a lot quicker. The propeller gets eaten by the SO2 in the water so the grandmother gets out of the boat for the last few meters to push. The acid in the water disintegrates her legs and she dies. Harry, Rachel and her kids steal a truck, the then come across a path were the lava as spilled over and they need to get across it, they take a chance and drive over it. At the other side the dog Ruffy is sitting on a rock.They then get back to the town everyone has fled and collect the E.L.F.

Harry Dalton (Pierce Brosnan) is one of the most experienced geologists in the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and a 4 years bachelor after he lost his girlfriend, Marianne (Walker Brandt) to a volcanic eruption in Columbia. He receives a call from his boss, Paul Dryfus (Charles Hallahan) to check on unusual activity of a dormant volcano in the Cascades called Dante's Peak. While the town of the same name is celebrating their accomplishment to be number 2 on the most wanted place to live in the country, he meets Rachael Wando (Linda Hamilton), the town mayor and owner of a food and drinks' store. While Harry is checking on Dante's Peak he notices trees, animals and even people had died recently near the volcano, and he wants to put the city council on alert, but people are putting economical interests first and security second. Even Dryfus would not listen to Harry, invoking lack of real scientific evidence while actually being afraid of causing huge financial losses for the investors, and countermands Harry's alert. For a week, the volcano was not overly active, but then the activity began to increase. Just as the city council was put on alert, Dante's Peak erupts. Harry and Rachael must traverse through ash that falls like rain, lava, acid lakes and a pyroclastic cloud to escape from the volcano, and save Rachael's mother and her two children.

I thought that the movie was very good and bad because it was very exciting to watch this movie. It has helped me understand more about volcanoes and earthquakes. It was also bad because in my opinion it was way too gruesome. I thought the story line of the movie was very good because it started off with Harry's girlfriend being killed by a pyroclast, this was horrific but it started the movie off really well. After this he met a girl called Rachel who was the mayor, he had a bit of romance with her. She had 2 kids, Graham and Lauren they got on well with Harry. I loved all these characters but I didn't like the Granny, Ruth because she only thought of herself throughout the movie, she later died in the movie, from jumping in the acidic lake. My favourite part of the movie was when the dog, rocky jumped in the back of the pick-up truck, this saved the dog's life and I was really happy about this. This movie was geographically spot on besides the part of the movie when the lake went acidic in a number of days, this would usually take a couple of weeks. Overall I loved this movie, it was humorous and exciting to watch, and I would say that this movie is really intense.",Dante's Peak
271,hkennedy-14802,Dante's peak review,8,23 October 2015,"Dantes peak movie review I am a year 10 pupil at Dromore high school and in my geography class we recently watched Dantes peak. I thought it was a fantastic movie but is very gory in some scenes so if you didn't like that type of thing this movie isn't for you. The main characters are harry, the volcanologist played by Pierce brosan, then there is Rachel the mayor of the town and also own the local café played by Linda Hamilton. Rachel has 2 children, Lauren and graham there is also the U.S.G.S team, Paul ""the boss"", harry, Barry and three others. The plot was that harry was sent to Dante's peak to see if there was any volcanic activity. Harry soon finds signs that the volcano is active for example dead squirrels, vegetation begin to die due sulphur dioxide and he found a couple that had been boiled up in hot springs. Harry wanted to send out an alert but Paul (the boss) wouldn't let him because it wasn't scientifically certain that it was going to erupt soon. Harry and Barry then go up to the volcano and send spider down to seen what was going on spider then stopped moving so Barry went down to fix the problem he unhooked himself from his harness and a minor earthquake occurs, rocks fall and harry breaks his leg. Later on in the film there is certain sign that the volcano is going to erupt and so they quickly call the town in to send an alert as they are in the middle of telling people what was about to happen an earthquake occurs soon the roof was falling in and the people panic and rush out the building in fear. The volcano erupts and Rachel Hs to get her kids who have drove up the mountain to save there grandma they then have to face many obstacles as there battle to get back down .when they finally make it down harry makes the decision to ram the car into this building as it was too dangerous to drive about the town ,he then gets Rachel and the kids to a safe spot and then rushes to the car to send a message to tell someone they are down there but rocks fall on top of him and he breaks his arm but pulls through and sends out the message and gets himself Rachel and her kids to safety, then him and Rachel fall in love and that's it. I did think it some parts it was unrealistic and exaggerated but was a good story, I really loved all of the gory parts and would totally recommended it if you aren't squeamish. I give Dante's peak a solid 8/10",Dante's Peak
272,mcorbett-83116,An interesting take on how destructive volcanoes can be,8,23 October 2015,"Recently in Geography class, we watched Dante's Peak following on our topic of volcanoes and earthquakes. The movie takes an unexpected turn at the start, when the main character (Harry) and his girlfriend who are volcanologists, explore and try to escape a small village that has been overrun by the eruption of a volcano. Unfortunately the girlfriend gets hit by a pyroclast and dies. Set 4 years later, the movie focuses on Harry, who has been sent to a town called Dante's Peak by his boss Paul, and fellow co-workers of the U.S.G.S to test out the activity of a volcano (which is based on Mt St. Helens), but when he gets to the town, he realises fast that the volcano is still active and could erupt at any moment. He makes friends with the mayor of the town, Rachel, and her kids who are also concerned about the volcanic activity and help Harry quickly try to warn the residents of the town of this discovery and save themselves in the process. In my opinion, I thought the movie was fine though it could've been more scary and realistic. I liked the hints to a possible relationship between Harry and Rachel and the things they have in common such as losing a love interest. My favourite scene was when they saved their pet dog and got trapped in the mines and tried to find their way out. I thought the scene was full of suspense. I was quite angered by the fact that Paul would not let the U.S.G.S alert the town sooner as it could've prevented some deaths and injuries and more time for the residents to get out/be prepared. It was sad when the grandmother, Ruth died but then again it could've been such an avoidable death in my eyes. Overall, I found the movie enjoyable to watch.",Dante's Peak
273,csmyth-68776,Dante's Peak Review year10,7,23 October 2015,"Recently in class we watched Dante's Peak as part of our year 10 topic, Earthquakes and Volcanoes. I really enjoyed this film, some parts were unrealistic and other parts were unrealistic. The main characters were:- Pierce Brosnan as Harry and Linda Hamilton as Rachael. Harry worked as a vulcanologist and Rachael was the Mayor of the town and she owned a coffee shop. Rachael had two children called Graeme and Lauren. Four years earlier, Harry's girlfriend was killed by a pyroclast from an active volcano. Paul, who worked for the U.S.G.S. was Harry's boss and he sent him to Dante's peak as there was live activity. Harry found several signs such as squirrels and trees dying. They also found two dead bodies in boiling springs. He tested the water and it was acidic. Harry wanted the whole town alerted. The water supply for the town was contaminated and it had turned an orangy colour. A town meeting was called and during it  the volcano erupted. It was complete mayhem! They went to the kids' granny's cabin but the lava had destroyed it. Luckily granny had got out in time and so had the dog. There was a lake which they had to cross in a boat but the motor broke and they had to paddle across. The water was extremely acidic and very dangerous. I don't think this was realistic because it wouldn't contaminate as quickly as that. Granny jumped into the contaminated water to push the boat the rest of the way in order to save everyone. The bottom half of granny's body disintegrated and unfortunately she died. Harry and the others stole a truck and they drove over lava. I think this part was very unrealistic because the tyres would probably have melted. E.L.F. was in the back of the truck, which is a tracking device that can send signals to N.A.S.A. They then rammed the truck into a mine. The roof of the mine collapsed in but they all got out safely, even the dog Ruffy. I think the geography side of the film is quite realistic, especially the eruption with the pyroclast falling and the debris, ash and rock. They measured how much activity was happening with a seismometer which is what they use in real life. Overall I thought this movie was great and I would recommend it.",Dante's Peak

Harry was a Vulcanologist who lost his girlfriend 4 years before Dante's peak to a pyroclast in Centeral America. Personally i thought the scene when Harrys girlfriend dies from being hit in the head with a pyroclast was gruesome and gory but very interesting . Harry's boss Paul sends Harry to Dante's peak to investigate the volcano. Harry discovers that the river contains Sulphur dioxide that was being released from the volcano was acidic and that this was leading to the death of vegetation and wildlife around it. Although i found this un-realistic as the water should not have became contaminated as soon a sit did. When Harry learns that the volcano is active and not dormant, he wanted to put the town on alert, although Paul refused as it would effect the towns income and tourism and the volcano could be a false alarm. Eventually the volcano erupts and this is mayhem. Many of the events results in tragedy. The Mayor played by Linda Hamilton, looses her mother-in-law when they try to escape from the molten lava and extreme ash clouds. The Mayor, her kids and Harry escape the horror but get trapped in a collapsing mine.Help finally come to the rescue and save them. i really enjoyed the chaos and tragedy of the movie and i learnt a lot of geographical facts and I would definitely recommend it .",Dante's Peak
275,crichardson-44933,Dante's Peak - A Movie Definite,8,23 October 2015,"Dante's Peak Movie Review Recently, in class we watched Dante's Peak as part of our ""Volcanoes and Earthquakes"" topic. I went into class with low expectations that were quickly heightened when I watched this masterpiece of a movie. Drama, romance, action and horror in ONE movie! What more could you want? Both educational and exciting, this movie ticks all the boxes! For geography or science enthusiasts, you'll find Dante's Peak almost 100% accurate, give or take a few scenes. From PH tests to Sulphur Dioxide – this movie's informative, yet appealing to the naive eye. Although, I'm not sure a truck could survive driving through lava. Not only does this movie feature amazingly talented actors and actresses but also a perfectly portrayed plot! Pierce Brosman stars as the lead role, Harry, a vulcanologist who becomes romantically involved with Rachel, the mayer and coffee shop owner, played by Linda Hamiliton who's famous for her appearance in the ""Terminator"" movies. Not everything's fun and games though! With a pyroclast killing Harry's previous girlfriend and now a supposedly ""dormant"" volcano threatening to wipe out an entire area of people! I'm definitely not a big fan of gore but even I agree they could have had more. What there was plenty of though, was explosive scenes that could easily have you cowering behind a pillow. My favourite moment was when the grandmother, known as Ruth sacrificed herself by sliding into acidic waters. Even though the scene was not truly accurate, it still reduced me to tears. She's a truly talented actress and my favourite character by far as she gave a heartfelt performance. I'd definitely recommend this movie to anybody (except young children) but hold on because this volcano will blow your socks off!",Dante's Peak
276,pcopes,dantes peak,9,23 October 2015,Recently in class we were watching Dantés peek and I can say that it is a very good movie. It made a volcano look as realistic as harry is trying to find about the volcanoes and see if there is going to be another volcano at Dantés Peek.The characters where very good as Harry Grnesone as Piers Brosnon as he played it very well and it look very dramatic. Four years ago Harry was in Peru and he lost his wife by a phyroclast. He worked with Paul who was his boss and all of his crew including Barry and three others. Harry ends up going to Dantés peek to check the volcano levels. Harry tested the waters and they where proved to be acidic. Harry then seen two squirrels lying dead as the sulpher dioxide was killing them and the trees too as the birds were flying away. A man and women then got into the hot tub and they then boiled to death. Meanwhile Rachel was collecting was collecting an award for her town. Harry wanted the town to be alerted but Paul refused as the town could go bankrupt. Harry found out that the water had been contaminated and then went to the town's water supply to see it was discolored and poisoned. The volcano then erupted and the entire town became crazy. Harry and Rachel and the children rammed into the underground mine and got trapped but Harry got the Gadget ELF by NASA and sent a signal to his other workers and they found them and they got freed and took them home and kept them safe.I think this movie was very good because of the amount of gore in the movie and because it was very dramatic with so many cliff hangers. I think my favourite part of the movie was when they all got freed. I would recommend everyone to watch this move. Thank You!!,Dante's Peak
277,hollymckinstry,Review of Dante's Peak,9,5 November 2015,"Hello there, I am reviewing the movie, Dante's Peak. I watched this movie in my year 10 Geography class. Before watching this movie in, I had watched this movie more than twice with my family. It was a long time ago so I cannot remember. Now on to the review. This is a personally one of my favourite movie. I thought Pierce Brosnan (Mamma Mia) and Linda Hamilton (Terminator) were brilliant!! At the start of the movie I thought it was sad. It is where Pierce's character's (Harry Dalton) girlfriend got hit by a pyroclast that had pierced through the car, and had died. I quite liked the part of the plot were Linda's character (Rachel Wando), who was the mayor and a coffee shop owner, came around to the motel where Harry and his team where staying, to give them coffee and Greg (Grant Heslov) came bounding out yelling ,""Coffee, Coffee, Coffee, Cappuccino!"" I laughed so hard at that part. That saddest part of the movie was were Granny Ruth (Elizabeth Hoffman) died, trying to save Rachel, Harry and the kids from a lake that had turned into a giant pool of acid. They were travelling across the lake when the acid starts to eat the boat and it starts to sink, so Ruth jumps into the lake and pulls the boat to the side of the lake. The part of the movie where I thought it was unrealistic when they drove over the lave and the wheels of the truck ,they stole, burst into flames but I think the extreme heat from the lava would at least exploded the gas tank of the car resulting in the explosion of the car. I think the real star of the movie was the volcano because I caused the most mayhem. All together I really like this movie. I would watch this move about ten more times before I got sick of it. The rating for this movie would be 9 out of 10.",Dante's Peak
278,brandonjlong,It's Gonna Blow,7,26 June 2016,"Gather your essentials, and your loved ones, and get the hell out of here! Eruption is on the rise in Ronald Donaldson's Dante's Peak, which puts a town of the same name at risk of destruction from a once dormant volcano that is coming out of hibernation. Dante's Peak lies in the Cascade mountains in Northern Washington. In the midst of the town's festival, the United States Geological Survey receives seismic activity readings that must be addressed. Their best scientist, Harry Dalton (Pierce Brosnan), is sent to investigate the situation. He is welcomed, and ushered around town, by Mayor Rachel Wando (Linda Hamilton), who may or may not catch feelings for the presumed hero.After running tests, and making observations, Dalton is highly concerned with the activity the mountain is displaying. However, his team does not share the same concern, and they do not back up his idea to alert the town of the possible risk. With the town on the verge of substantial growth due to a major development, the council does not want to disrupt the community. Well, this decision turns out to be the wrong one, and calamity erupts throughout the town, along with the volcano. After complete destruction of the town, Harry Dalton manages to escape death, and save Rachel and her children. But what about the facts? How accurate can this volcanic event be?From what I have gathered, the eruption seems fairly accurate, to some extent. The volcano is a stratovolcano, which produces explosive eruptions with pyroclastic flows, tephra, and lava flows. Tephra is any debris that becomes airborne in an eruption such as, ash and rock. Flooding from the melting of snow, and ice caps, due to the release of extremely hot gases from beneath the crust is an actual possibility that the movie displays. However, the lava flow scene might not be as accurate. Given the type of volcano, lahar flows that are thick, debris filled flows that move slowly, are the type of flow that should have been depicted. The flows in the film moved at a much faster pace. Also, in a scene where Harry and his new friends are trying to make it back down the mountain, they are cutoff by lava flow, and he decides to drive across it. The truck would have never made it across. Heat from the lava can reach well over 1000ºF, and would have destroyed the vehicle. Hey, it is Hollywood, right?Despite a few inaccuracies, the film provides a pleasant, engaging experience and is overall a good movie. I recommend anyone to view Dante's Peak, and experience a nice natural hazard thriller. It may just spark an interest in geology, and volcanology for some. On a scale of five stars, I give it four stars.",Dante's Peak

In my point of view, this film is much more realistic and slightly more scientifically accurate (composite volcanoes do not eject fast-moving, low-viscosity lava) Although a lot of perspectives have their ups and downs, ""Dante's Peak"" is a good film, and it somewhat keeps the audience in suspense of what would happen next.",Dante's Peak
