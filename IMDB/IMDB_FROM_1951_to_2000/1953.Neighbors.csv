0,bkoganbing,Animal House redux,3,3 July 2014,"Zac Efron's relentless drive to get away from his Disney image took a quantum leap with this ode to Animal House film Neighbors. I'm not sure he'll like the direction. Neighbors is a witless and rather gross comedy about a married couple with their baby who have the misfortune to have a fraternity headed by Efron and his best friend Dave Franco. Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne play the couple and they for reasons I haven't figured out yet want to be seen as hip and cool to the frat boys. But when after one of their parties gets way out of hand war gets declared.Animal House wasn't all that much better, but at least it never pretended to be anything but what it was. I can't say that for Neighbors. I feel bad for Efron who gave such a great performance in Charlie St. Cloud.Sights of Efron and the other hunky lads in various states of undress should titillate the audience of teen girls and gay men. Efron really bulked up for the role.I hope something better comes along for you Zac.",Neighbors
1,SnoopyStyle,Fun chemistry and love all the characters but missing a bad guy,7,21 December 2014,"Kelly (Rose Byrne) and Mac Radner (Seth Rogen) are a young couple with a baby. They still want to be in their irresponsible youth. Their couple friends Jimmy Blevins (Ike Barinholtz) and Paula Faldt (Carla Gallo) are divorced and even more irresponsible. A college fraternity moves in next door. Teddy Sanders (Zac Efron) is the President, and Pete Regazolli (Dave Franco) is his right hand man. At first, everybody tries to get along despite the loud late night parties. Mac promises not to call the cops. However he soon breaks his promise and it's war.I love the pairing of Rose Byrne and Seth Rogen. She is almost as inappropriate and stupid as he is. That's the great thing about this pair. They have a hilarious scene about Kevin James. That scene is the essence of this marriage. I like everybody at the frat. Both Zac Efron and Dave Franco are solid. This movie is missing the edge or the tension that a great bad guy provides. Zac's likability counters any conflict the two sides have. He doesn't have to be the bad guy but somebody should be. The tension is never high but this is a funny movie.",Neighbors
2,Horst_In_Translation,Old people vs. young people,6,3 June 2015,"This is a one-year-old comedy movie from 2014 starring Seth Rogen, Rose Byrne and Zac Efron. A group of fraternity students moves in next to a young family and while the two try to get along initially, it becomes quite a confrontation as the film goes on due to the young guys' constant noise and partying. The film is 90 minutes long (without credits) and the MVP here for me is Rose Byrne (even if she is not on the poster), who shows a prime example performance of how hot women/actresses can also play funny characters. She also got the most awards recognition from the trio. This film was one of the big players at the last MTV Movie awards and took home wins there too. Sometimes the film is funny (like the airbag parts), sometimes not that much. Rogen does a decent job too, Efron was fairly forgettable and he seemed more evil throughout the film than his character asked for. I guess there is a reason why he is only starring in films with the lesser known Franco brother and not the Oscar-nominated James.The film's director is fairly experienced, worked on several known films in the past already, but the writer team really isn't that prolific (yet). Taking that into account, they did a very fine job here. I believe this is one of the best written comedy movies from last year and I'm looking forward to their next projects. Taking into account how the two have been working together for years, I am fairly certain, there will be a lot more to come in the next years. One of the best parts of this film was that they kept the dramatic moments (protagonists splitting up, a college professor getting severely injured...) really funny too, so this would not become too heavy and actually it took the 100% comedy path and that was the perfect decision. The only scene that I did not like that much was Efron's and Rogen's characters talking like buddies in the end after all that happened before. I didn't find it realistic, even if several months had passed. Minor criticism only and I recommend watching this film. Good job by pretty much everybody involved. Random side note: Rose Byrne, who I liked the most here, is Australian-born and there is a long-running Australian series called ""Neighbors"" too, which turned people such as Kylie Minogue into stars. Of course, the series has nothing to do with this film, just a little snippet of information. Oh and back to this film, I also liked the way they handled the closing credits with the help of the baby from the film.",Neighbors
3,Prismark10,Neighbours at war,4,3 September 2014,"Silly, bawdy teen comedy about a frat house in the middle of the suburbs whose all night partying who keeps Seth Rogen, his wife and infant up all night but strangely most of the other neighbours seem to be OK by the all night noise because the students help wash their cars and mow the lawn etc.As Rogen called the police because of the noise, he and Efron who is the lead of Frat pack call all out war which escalates.There are some nice bits such as the the De Niro party, The air bag cushion but you never sort of get over that Rogen is the old geezer here, the man is only 32 years old.Zac Efron who is only 5 years younger is almost psychopathic here, why get upset when you have repeatedly ignored reasonable requests to turn the music down and they have then been forced to called the police?There are a few laughs, some risqué humour, nothing is very sophisticated and the acting is broad. I have seen both Efron and Rogen in better stuff but their fight scene is good even though it seems to be a homage to the Cage/Goodman fight in Raising Arizona.",Neighbors
4,nogodnomasters,HE'S STILL ALIVE,4,12 October 2018,"Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly (Rose Byrne) just had a baby and try to convince themselves that their life is not over and they are not old. When a frat house moves in next door lead by Teddy Sander (Zac Efron), their delusion is challenged as the film breaks down into our couple attempting to sabotage the overly noisy frat house, the one that invented toga parties and beer pong.The humor for the most part was low brow ,crude, and juvenile. It was predictable humor which translates into unfunny. The swearing and drug use was forced and unnatural. This is a me-too crude comedy that failed to stay above the water of a flooded basement.Zac takes his shirt off, a plus for the ladies, but they must sit through Seth showing off his mammoth butt during a sex scene.",Neighbors
5,kosmasp,Bad Neighbors,7,20 September 2014,"Though the question is, who's bad? But let's refrain from song lyrics and get down to business. The movie is mostly funny, though it does have issues with its characters here and there. It does not rely on T&A as another reviewer suggests on this site, but that does not mean you will like this movie ... it's all a matter of taste. Maybe you hate Zac, maybe you love him and he can't do any wrong. This all influences your movie experience obviously.Also there are jokes in here, that might not be anyones taste or maybe they don't get them (De Niro/Taxi Driver references and more). Aside from that, this is a pretty decent effort to make something funny out of a crazy situation and shine a light on how relationships can work out.",Neighbors
6,Sleepin_Dragon,How to kick the Frats out of next door.,4,14 October 2015,"Mac and Kelly are getting used to life with a new born baby, a pretty cool couple, life is significantly turned upside down when the delivery men roll up, and a Frat house move in next door. Initial protestations to the noise are minor, then war breaks out between the neighbours. They try everything they can to get them kicked out of the houseI can see that most of the reviews on here are very negative, but there are a few funny bits. Crude at times, but worse some of it just isn't that funny. I like Seth Rogan, but it isn't the best of his work, he's tried so hard to be cool. Zac Efron is a cool guy, he looks like he could be some of his fellow frats dad.4/10",Neighbors
7,jboothmillard,Bad Neighbours,5,23 May 2021,"I remember hearing about this movie, because of the two leading actors, and because it got a sequel, so it I knew it must have been popular, I was just hoping for a good laugh, directed by Nicholas Stoller (Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Get Him to the Greek). Basically, Mac Radner (Seth Rogen) and his Australian wife Kelly (Rose Byrne) are settling down in a quiet neighbourhood with their new-born child, six-month-old baby daughter Stella (Elise and Zoey Vargas). The responsibilities of parenthood make it difficult for them to maintain their old lifestyle, they try to cling into being youthful and their sex life. They have become somewhat alienated from their friends Jimmy Blevins (Ike Barinholtz) and his ex-wife, Paula (Carla Gallo). Mac and Kelly are excited when they are getting new neighbours, unfortunately the new arrivals turn out to be the Delta Psi Beta fraternity. The fraternity's leaders, Teddy Sanders (Zac Efron) and Pete Regazolli (Dave Franco) come across friendly when meeting Mac and Kelly, but their housewarming party becomes loud and wild. Teddy and Pete aspire to join Delta Psi's Hall of Fame by throwing a massive end-of-the-year party. The couple ask Teddy to keep the noise down, but he decides to invite them to join the party. The Radners are initially reluctant but remain convinced that they still have a modicum of cool left in them and are happy to partake in heavy drinking and drugtaking. Teddy agrees to manage the noise for further parties, but has Mac and Kelly promise to always call him instead of the police. The following night, when another party next door keeps Stella awake, Mac is unable to reach Teddy. Kelly convinces Mac to call the police anonymously, but Officer Watkins (Hannibal Buress) identifies them to Teddy. Betrayed, Teddy leads Delta Psi in dumping their garbage on the Radners' lawn, this is known as hazing. Mac and Kelly complain to Dean Carol Gladstone (Lisa Kudrow), but the school has a ""three strikes"" policy before it will intervene; Delta Psi's first strike was burning down their old house. The couple try to force the fraternity to move by damaging their house, but this is unsuccessful. Mac and Kelly decide to join another party, pretending to allow themselves a night of fun. There, Kelly manipulates Pete and Teddy's girlfriend Brooke Shy (Halston Sage) into having sex, with Mac getting Teddy to catch them in the act. Teddy and Pete fight, and a passing professor is injured by a barbecue grill that rolls outside. This gives Delta Psi their second strike and places them on probation, effectively ending their party plans. Mac and Kelly ask Jimmy, who is jealous that Paula is sleeping with Delta Psi member Scoonie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), to help them shut down the fraternity. To acquire evidence of Delta Psi's recent hazing, they ask fraternity pledge Assjuice (Craig Roberts) to talk to Teddy and record him threatening retaliation. But Teddy shows Assjuice kindness, who cannot go through with the plan and openly admits Mac and Kelly trying to sabotage the fraternity. Teddy feeling vengeful pranks the Radners, by taking out the airbags from the car, and placing them under chairs and sofas to rapidly deflate, causing Mac to fly into the air or hit the ceiling. Mac and Kelly create a counterfeit letter from Gladstone lifting Delta Psi's probation. The fraternity prepares for their end-of-the-year party, which Mac, Kelly, and Jimmy widely publicise to ensure it will be out of control. Once the party is in full swing, they notify the police, but Teddy realises what the Radners have done, and stops the party just as Officer Watkins arrives. Jimmy throws himself from the balcony to distract Teddy, severely breaking his leg, which allows Kelly to sneak into Teddy's bedroom. While Mac fights Teddy off, Kelly cannot open the breaker box to restart the party. Instead, she lights one of the fireworks in the room and shoots it at the officer's patrol car. Paula convinces Scoonie to turn on the power, reigniting the party, and she reunites with Jimmy. Teddy takes the blame for the party, convincing Pete to flee with the others, and is arrested. The fraternity receives its third and final strike and is shut down. Four months later, Mac runs into Teddy, who is working as a shirtless greeter at clothing store Abercrombie & Fitch. They greet each other warmly and Teddy reveals he is attending night classes to complete his degree. Mac takes off his shirt and jokingly acts as a greeter with Teddy. While Mac and Kelly are taking pictures of Stella, Jimmy and Paul call and invite them to an event, they decide to accept their roles as parents and politely decline. Also starring Brian Huskey as Bill Wazowkowski, Jerrod Carmichael as Garf, Andy Samberg as Toga #1 and Steve Carell as TV News. Rogen, Byrne and Efron give equally funny and likeable performances, there are the obvious over-the-top slapstick and small gross-out moments, but the best moments are between the actors parring between each other, a fun comedy.

8,moonspinner55,"""It's not only offensive, it's f*****g stupid.""",2,20 June 2015,"New suburban parents, hoping a quiet, prosperous gay couple will move into the empty house next door, watch in horror as a rowdy fraternity takes over the property, turning their lives upside-down. Star and co-producer Seth Rogen is enamored of two things: himself and genitalia jokes; co-star Zac Efron, as the fraternity's president, hopes to be comically menacing but instead comes off like Rob Lowe having a bad day. Screenwriters Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O'Brien obviously want us to sympathize with Rogen and spouse Rose Byrne--even as the couple is continually terrorized-for-a-laugh--but with whom are they and director Nicholas Stoller simpatico with? Stoller seems to be getting off on the loud parties and the rampant destruction, while the uncharismatic younger players systematically hold their neighbors and the audience hostage. Ostensibly aimed at the age-range depicted in the frat house, but character names such as ""Assjuice"" aren't all that funny. *1/2 from ****",Neighbors
9,Quinoa1984,very f****ing funny,8,11 November 2014,"Neighbors is unpretentious, usually and fully laugh-out-loud entertainment from the director of Forgetting Sarah Marshall. From my point of view, even if this isn't as deep or memorable as that film, the efforts are still just as funny (or per minute funnier) which is remarkable. Seth Rogen is on top of his game, as we might hope, and is on fire with zinger after zinger as his character has to deal with not only this crazy-ass frat, but also his wife (the two don't really have any 'manufactured' rom-com problems, which is just wonderful, serious, how often do you see a married couple actually HAPPY and collaborative as they get?) But Zac Efron surprises the most with his best character - hey, just performance - yet, full of fire and energy and comic timing that matches up to Rogen. And there's loads of great improv - you know this was barely scripted right - and probably some scripted stuff, too. For a pre-summer season crowded with action spectacles, this did what it should have, if not as mind blowing as last year's diversion from Rogen and Goldberg and company, This is the End). Rose Byrne is also a comic revelation here too - previously I've just seen her in dramas and a few big movies like X-Men - as she actually sets the comic tone in many scenes, not just keeping up with Rogen and this crew. Oh, and Dave Franco is there, being... Dave Franco.It doesn't carry any big message, aside from, perhaps, a gentle nudge to 20 and 30 somethings that... you don't have to grow up ALL the way but making a little effort may help your self esteem, which is probably more powerful to me than any 'love' stuff. They even coin a new term, derived from 'hot-box-ing' called 'hot-house'. You'll see what it is.",Neighbors
10,tavm,Neighbors had some good dirty lines and scenes,6,19 May 2014,"Just saw this with my movie theatre-working friend. Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne play a married couple with baby having to deal with a fraternity moving across the street. What follows is a lot of visual and verbal jokes about partying, getting drunk and stoned, getting laid, etc. I laughed a few times then realized that the writers seemed to almost forget that the concern was supposed to be about the baby's well being instead of the hurt egos that seemed to permeate throughout. Still, overall, like I said, me and my friend had some good laughs and one shouldn't take this too seriously since this is a comedy. So on that note, Neighbors is worth a look.",Neighbors
11,edwagreen,Beyond Awful 0*,1,18 April 2015,"A most distasteful, annoying and disgusting film that I have seen in a long time.A very immature couple prone to using profanity live with their newborn in a house only to have a fraternity move in next to them. Joining them so as to beat them regarding the noise doesn't work so the film becomes devoted to each group doing nasty things to the other with complete mayhem resulting.Where is the rest of the neighborhood in all this commotion? The dean of the college comes across as a perfect idiot with her 3 strike system and the police are also looked upon to being quite foolish here. The film becomes so awful that it shows their baby swallowing a condom and that all this nonsense has a nasty effect on their marriage.",Neighbors
12,hitchcockthelegend,All aboard the familiar express that's bound for averageville.,5,8 March 2015,"A strange one this, the groundswell opinion on internet forums by film fans of various ages is one of contempt, whilst on the professional critical front reviews are more favourable, certainly on the plus side. Bad Neighbours is neither a 1/10 or a 7 - 8 - 9/10 movie, it's sits somewhere in the middle at averageville station still awaiting the signal for go.Trying to pitch together frat comedy and middle aged comedy worries is a dangerous idea, more so when the entire film comes off as a sketch show. Too many gags fall flat on their face here, the makers straining too hard to make something viable for a cross generational audience to laugh at. It mostly feels like ad nauseum, like we have been here before, seen it before and worn the tight fitting t-shirt.Rose Byrne and Seth Rogen deserve better than this, yet they are the only ones keeping the picture watchable, where even as they are forced to fumble around with weak willed gross - cum - sex comedy sketches (improvised or otherwise), there's a pull from them that at least gives off a grounded reality vibe. There's also a couple of comedy gold moments, of which do not need to be spoilt here.So it's not a total loss per se, but its comedy longevity is sure to be brief. 5/10",Neighbors

14,utgard14,"""We have caller ID. We're cops.""",5,21 September 2014,"We're getting to the point that these types of comedies, which Seth Rogen has made a career of, are losing all of their impact. You can only be so crass, gross, and vulgar before a desensitized viewing public starts asking ""what else you got?"" This comedy is enjoyable enough in spite of Rogen and his try-hard costar Rose Byrne, who apparently views ""women can be pigs, too"" as some sort of badge of honor. I don't get it but there you go. Anyway, the movie is watchable in spite of these two. The supporting cast makes it work, particularly Jerrod Carmichael as Garf and Hannibal Buress as Officer Watkins. Every scene these two have (which isn't enough) is funny. They're the only two characters that aren't walking clichés, also. Zac Efron has received a lot of praise for his turn here, most of which seems to be of the 'backhanded compliment' variety. Dave Franco basically plays Dave Franco. Christopher Mintz-Plasse has a minor role, which let's face it, is where he really belongs. Anyway, watchable and a few laughs here & there.

15,zardoz-13,"""Animal House"" Revisited!!!",8,19 May 2016,"""Neighbors"" is a riotous comedy of errors. The premise is pretty basic: a young, married couple with an infant daughter is settling into a starter home in the suburbs. Mac Radner (Seth Rogen of ""Knocked Up"") and his wife Kelly (Rose Byrne of ""Bridesmaids"") are experiencing their first burst of parenthood. Kelly lives and breathes according to the baby monitor, while Mac performs the dutiful chores as the breadwinner and goes to work every day. Although we don't know what kind of work he does, Mac has a naïve boss that doesn't like to impose himself as an authority figure on his employees. Meantime, Mac and his newly divorced best friend Jimmy (Ike Barinholtz) like to smoke marijuana out back during 'joint file' breaks. Mac and Kelly are learning how to stage their lives, particularly time for coitus, around their adorable daughter Stella. The first scene when Mac and Kelly are humping and bumping in a chair, with Mac sitting and Kelly perched astride him, is amusing because Stella is watching them with her big, round, bright eyes. Mac gets flustered because Stella is observing them, and he suggests that they turn her around. No sooner are they back to bumping and grinding than Mac notices that Stella has turned around and is scrutinizing their every move with infantile fascination. The trials and tribulations of young married parents is nothing compared to what awaits them when the college fraternity Delta Psi Beta buys the house and converts it into a party hardy paradise. Naturally, Mac and Kelly fear that the Greeks will not only keep them up but also Stella, so they plan strategies to dampen those shenanigans. Actually, one of my best friends had to contend with a fraternity that moved into a residential neighborhood and all the uproar that those college kids posed. In ""Neighbors,"" the frats and the young couple repeatedly refer to the distance—ten feet—they lie between them.Initially, Mac and Kelly, with Stella in a stroller, approach Delta Psi House and meet President Teddy Sanders (Zac Efron of ""17 Again""), Vice President Pete (David Franco of ""21 Jump Street""), and the rest of the kids. Naturally, everybody finds Stella too cute for words while the Radners welcome the Deltas but give them subtle warning about keeping it down. In an earlier scene, Mac and Kelly discussed the various ways that they could ask the kids to keep it down. The first night in the neighborhood, the Deltas stage a blow-out party and invite Mac and Kelly to it because Teddy is afraid that the couple could create trouble for them. Mac and Kelly are determined not to behave like 'old people' and they indulge themselves. Everything goes into the crapper during the second night. Earlier, Teddy convinced them that all they had to do is notify them when the music and the party got to out of hand. Teddy doesn't want them to call the police. After several attempts to contact Teddy and company, Mac and Kelly decide to call the police. Erroneously, they believe that they have made an anonymous call. They watch as the police, in the form of one cop, Officer Watkins (Hannibal Buress of ""The Kings of Summer""), arrives and informs the Deltas that they have having too much fun. Mac and Kelly watch from their front window and director Nicholas Stoller frame the shot from their perspective. Mac and Kelly are horrified when the cop points in their direction and everybody gravitates to their front door and the young married couple are revealed to be the ones who lodged the complaint. Mac and Kelly withdraw their complaint and the Deltas proceed to make their life a 'hell on earth.' ""Neighbors"" bristles with pervasive drug use. The Deltas smoke, toke, and puff with a variety of paraphernalia. The parties that they stage are virtuously as rowdy as anything that James Belushi and company held in ""National Lampoon's Animal House."" Like Delta Tau Chi Fraternity in ""Animal House,"" The Deltas find themselves in hot water with the equivalent of John Vernon's Dean Vernon Wormer, but Dean Carol Gladstone (Lisa Kudrow of ""Romy and Michele's High School Reunion"") is a woman. Nevertheless, she stays on the Deltas and has to run interference when the Radner comes to complain to her about the Deltas. A huge part of the problem is that the Deltas, particularly Teddy and Pete, have established new ground rules since they moved in next door to the Radners. They want to go down in history as path-breaking Deltas. Meaning, they want to partying to the next level. All of this sparks a war of sorts between the Deltas and the Radners and the oldsters are determined to run off the youngsters. At one point, Mac and Kelly decide to sabotage the plumbing next door, and Mac manages to smash a water pipe so that the basement floods. The Radners figure that if they can destroy the house that the Deltas will have to vacate the premises since they will not be able to pay for the improvements. Incredibly, the Deltas turn their predicament around. They sponsor a dildo yard sale and earn more than enough money to pay for a pool and these party animals really whoop it up. Mac and Kelly decide to attack the Deltas by setting them at each other's throats. Kelly comes up with a plan to turn Teddy and Pete against each other by getting Pete to bed down with Teddy's girlfriend. Of course, the Deltas strike back at the Radners. One of the funniest gags in ""Neighbors"" is the use of automobile air bags to surprise the oldsters. These scenes are totally off the chart hilarious. If you love to watch farces, ""Neighbors"" is good, mindless, fun. Seth Rogen has no shame, and the competition between the frats and the young married couple is lively.",Neighbors
16,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Amiable relations with some nuisances,7,18 July 2014,"Married with infant daughter Rosie(the twins Vargas, who we all agree are adorable and has some of the best moments) and living in suburbia is boring Mac(Rogen, still wanting to get stoned) and Kelly(Byrne, dying to get out of the house she is allowed to let loose, nearly steals the show, but does also do some of the worst things which makes the lack of consequences for the couple, and the clear way this sides with them). When a frat moves in next door, they both worry about the loud parties(which do get repetitive and exhausting, quick), and see a way to prove, in part to themselves, that they're still cool and irresponsible(for a while, they certainly live up to the latter). And once they call the cops on the bros, an all-out war is declared.This is very funny, but only the climax is non-stop hilarity. When it crosses the line into the offensive, it does actually make us laugh, it isn't pure shock value. The set-pieces are great, memorable and often inspired. There are some issues with the humor, a lot of it arising from trying very hard to make our sides ache. Too much awkwardness(when some of it, such as the response to a fist-bump, is actually really good), going loud for the end of a scene in place of a punchline, because it's a way to get a reaction(when that, by itself, isn't actually that compelling). And while a lot of solid material comes out of the improvising, it does grind the movie to a halt to let them riff off each other.In spite of some inconsistencies and vagueness to the personality in the background ones, this does get a lot of strong bits from its characters. Our two protagonists, and how they are together, and it becomes explosive when you add the president of the Delta Psi, Teddy(Ephron, dumb and determined to leave a legacy via a year-end epic blowout and while the whole trio get to play both extremes, his gentle, charming leader-type and his pure, unrestrained psycho are phenomenal). Likewise, this contrasts the two neighbors well(albeit never properly explaining why no one else in the area are bothered by the noise), with both jealous of some of what the other has be it a fun life, or a set future.This contains constant coarse language, sexuality, drug content, violence, and some nudity. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a raunchy teen comedy. 7/10",Neighbors
17,neil-476,Had its moments,7,9 May 2014,"Kelly and Mac, parents of baby Stella and talented swearers (in terms of quantity, if not quality), buy their first home and are worried when a fraternity acquires the house next door. After trying to get on, the late night noise proves an insurmountable problem and the two factions go to war.Seth Rogan's presence (as dad Mac) should tell you that this is a comedy: Rose Byrne as mum Kelly and Zac Efron as fraternity president Teddy, not so much. I went into this as someone who isn't a fan of Rogen (but quite likes Byrne and Efron), predisposed to sympathise with the parents, and therefore tending towards prejudging the movie as something I would feel antagonistic towards despite having read positive things about it - I hate hate hated Project X, another ""comedy"" about party loving young people making their neighbours' lives a misery because their right to be disruptive trumps the right of others to a peaceful existence.But Bad Neighbours is quite funny and moves towards an ultimately satisfactory resolution (in the course of which Rogen and Efron have an improbable fight which is physically very funny indeed).It is not without fault. It's unclear exactly where Efron's character lies: the affability with which he starts and finishes the film is at complete odds with the Mr Hyde transformation which appears to be provoked by the fact that Mac and Kelly phoned the police after specifically agreeing not to (even though they only did it because their repeated requests for quiet were ignored). The actions of the idiot policeman are not even slightly credible, and neither is the inactivity of the other neighbours.

It has its moments, but not enough of them.The problem is that the jokes the film sets up are just too stupid to enjoy. For example, the scene where Rose Byrne's breasts become engorged and she and Seth Rogen flop around slapstick fashion not knowing what on earth to do about it. I don't even have breasts and I know that she could have just milked them herself to ease the pressure, but does that idea occur to these two? No, it doesn't, though they're both far too educated and involved in their new parenthood for it not to. And the whole movie's like that, trying to wring easy laughs from lazy setups.I did like the film's final message though, that the world of irresponsibility and partying is not something to be mourned by adults who've grown out of it, and they don't need to apologize for not missing it.Grade: C+",Neighbors
19,anaconda-40658,Seth Rogen vs Mr. Rogers.,8,21 May 2015,"Neighbors (2014): Dir: Nicholas Stoller / Cast: Seth Rogen, Rose Byrne, Zac Efron, Dave Franco, Ike Barinholtz: John Belushi was in two comedies that seem to be combine here with National Lampoon's Animal House and Neighbors. This is that feeling one gets upon expectations arising. Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne play a young married couple with a baby, and Zac Efron leads a fraternity that moves in next door. As predicted good intentions are undone by broken trust and the two sides begin a back and forth feud. Nicholas Stoller has made such great comedies as Get Him to the Greek and Forgetting Sarah Marshall as well as the disappointing Five-Year Engagement. Repetition is countered by a great comedic climax and an ending that actually pays off. Rogen and Byrne have great comedic chemistry as they struggle to deal with the noise level next door. Rogen becomes the victim to an air bag prank that sends him through the ceiling at work. Byrne's has a scene that involves Rogen attempting to draw milk from her breasts. Efron gives perhaps his best performance to date as this handsome fraternity leader whose charm conceals a devious and vengeful side. Dave Franco steals scenes as Efron's best friend whom Byrne's learns has an infatuation with Efron's girlfriend. Ike Barinholtz plays Rogan's divorced friend and co-worker whose ex-wife still hangs out with them, which becomes awkward.

20,FlashCallahan,That's the wrong Sam Jackson speech....,6,16 October 2014,"Rogen and Byrne play new parents who are getting used to having a family when a Fraternity move in next door.When the noise becomes irksome, they go round to complain, but end up joining the party, they bond with Zac Efron, and at the end of the night, Zac asks that if it gets too noisy, just speak to him, and not call the police.The next night, after several attempts contacting Zac, they finally succumb to calling the cops. This begins a string of events that nearly leads to an all out war between the two households.I wasn't looking forward to this movie. The fact that it was released on a Saturday in order to garner a huge opening weekend irked me some, and I've never really really like any of Rogens work, apart from The Guilt Trip.But it's funny, in a really guilty pleasure sort of way, and even though some of the humour is below immature, the narrative holds the film together. Plus Efron and Byrne can really do good comedy.My opinion of Rogen hasn't changed, he's still the same character he played in Knocked Up, swearing for no good reason, and making a point of thinking that fat is funny. it's not, it's the person.All in all it's a funny film, especially if you are a new parent, because you can relate to the new parents.But you will forget it the day after.Top moments are the De Niro Part and Efrons impression of Christian Bale.",Neighbors

Sometimes it's originally laugh out loud funny maybe 60% of the time. Cute generational jokes here and there.The highly likable cast is the best part here. The lovely and very slender Rose Byrne can do anything from drama (Damages) to horror (Insidious) to comedy (Bridesmaids) and she is totally sweet and totally delightful to watch. The baby is cute too. Seth is less self indulgent than usual and the role is tailor made for his brand of humor. Zac Efron's deadpan and serious frat boy is the right counter part. Mintz Plasse is under used.Deserves to be the hit it is.,Neighbors
22,KineticSeoul,Eh...,5,21 June 2014,"On a positive not, this does have few amusing and even slightly funny moments that got few chuckles out of me. Maybe 2 or three times at the most. There is a lot of these versus types of movies with different premises and I thought the premise would be kinda cool. When it comes down to it, this is a boring movie that maybe youngsters or still have the mentality of a 12 to 16 year olds might find entertaining. Because of the fraternity party scenes. So yeah, it might be enticing for some viewers, but when it comes to the comedy and the core of the movie it just falls short. From the trailers I thought the grown up couple would be the side that the audiences would be rooting for and they will be the victims that put up a fight. But it's the fraternity boys that I seemed to have more of a conscience, besides the whole air bags under the seat parts. As a matter of fact the grown up side seemed more immature at times and the chemistry between the fraternity bros were much more higher that the grown up couples. I give this movie a 5.9/10 because the realistic points of views of certain grown ups and coming of age aspects.5.9/10",Neighbors
23,Hellmant,Not quite up to my standards for a Seth Rogen flick.,8,14 May 2014,"'NEIGHBORS': Four Stars (Out of Five) New hit comedy film from Seth Rogen; he stars in and produced the movie, with Evan Goldberg (his usual producing/writing partner) and James Weaver (who also produced 'THIS IS THE END' with the duo). Nicholas Stoller directed the flick (he's also directed hit comedy films like 'FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL', 'GET HIM TO THE Greek' and 'THE FIVE-YEAR ENGAGEMENT' and written or co-written funny movies like 'YES MAN', 'THE MUPPETS' and 'MUPPETS MOST WANTED'). It was written by debut feature film writers Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O'Brien and tells the story of a couple, who are new parents struggling with getting older, that are forced to put up with the harassment of a fraternity (that moves into the house next door). Zac Efron, Rose Byrne and Dave Franco (James Franco's kid brother) costar in it. I found it to be pretty funny but not quite up to my standards for a Seth Rogen flick.Rogen and Byrne play Mac and Kelly Radner; a couple that just moved into a new house, in a quiet neighborhood, with their newborn baby. They're trying to adapt to the parent life and accepting getting older (while unintentionally distancing themselves from their friends). Their new life is derailed when a fraternity moves into the house next door to them. That frat is called Delta Psi and their led by Teddy Sanders (Efron) and Pete Regazolli (Franco). Teddy and Pete are always throwing wild and loud parties and really want to make Delta Psi's Hall of Fame. Mac and Kelly try to make peace with the frat (and ask them to keep it down) while Teddy and Pete make the couple promise to call them first (before the cops). When Mac and Kelly can't get ahold of the frat leaders, one night, they renege on their promise (and call the police on them). A war then erupts between the fraternity and the new parents.The movie had a huge opening weekend (close to $50 million) and is on it's way to becoming one of the most financially successful comedy flicks ever. I think that's great but it doesn't quite deserve it. Seth Rogen is my favorite comedic actor and I love almost everything he's in but this is not nearly as classic as 'THIS IS THE END' (which this is constantly being compared to for some reason), 'PINEAPPLE EXPRESS', 'SUPERBAD', 'KNOCKED UP', 'THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN', etc.. It is a funny and well made comedy film (don't get me wrong) but it's not one of the best ever. Some of the jokes are misfires, and more awkward than anything else (which I'm fine with and like), but it's not laugh out loud hilarious (at least not from start to finish). It is a decent comedy movie though; Rogen and Efron are both good in it (and Stoller's directing is fine) but the script could have used a few more rewrites.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVg96qKy2R0",Neighbors
24,thesar-2,"Project X, but FUN, FUNNY, WELL MADE, ETC.",7,11 May 2014,"2014's Neighbors, a comedy not to be confused with the dark comedy from 1981 with the same name and similar looking male leads, was, indeed, part-Project X, but 80x better. Unfortunately, with the crapfest Project X was, that usually isn't saying much.But, since I'm only comparing the two films due to the raving frat house party, I'll drop Project Xas should the studio have done before that movie was made.Neighbors was one of those movies that wasn't just absolutely hilarious, but deserves, no – needs, at least two to three viewings to get it all in. While I got most of what I needed, there were more parts I would've surely paused during a home viewing to let it sink in. Also, I was laughing too loud to get all I needed from the comedy, writing and dozens of cameos.Currently, I am rating movie 3½/5 stars, but I do believe it may increase in stars and liking with at least the second or third viewing. My two biggest problems involved the script and editing. The script that seemed to need at least another run-through and I'm not referring to the jokes. 85%-90% of those worked. But, the slight base of the story was shoddy at times. As was the editing where scenes seemed to abruptly end and without rhyme, reason or even a second, they began a completely different direction as if a ton was cut out that would've explained a bunch.Basically, it's a simple, but enjoyable story of a fraternity house that moves in next to an ""old couple's"" house and with their newborn, they like things quiet. At the same time, they miss their youth – both of the ""old couple.""Nevertheless, they do all they can to sabotage the title characters right out of the neighborhood.Funny. I should relate to this movie more that the target audience it was aimed at. I am about the same age of that ""old couple"" and the reason I keep using quotes should be obvious. I don't find them old, per se, but that's the idea of the movie. We have ""old"" (30s-40s) verses the ""young"" (teens to early 20s.)I can relate because the bulk of my work peers/friends, the ones I see the most during the week, are all in their mid-twenties and though I am not seen as an outcast – at least, I don't think I am – I'm still more than a decade older than all of them. Hell, I'm even eight years and 1 month older than Seth Rogen – the target ""old"" guy in this movie.There is a point here: should people attempt to live their lives in the present or regret and try to hold onto the past? Our heroes, or the ""old folks,"" have to make that realization here.Besides the somewhat message, the movie is an absolute riot and I would think is geared more towards young male's humor (Seth, you still got it) I believe women would love it to. If not just for the strong and fun character of Kelly Radner (Rose Byrne,) Seth's wife in the film, I'm sure they'd also love the endless shots of shirtless and buff Zac Efron.Personally, and shamelessly, I went to this movie to see the endless (and somewhat more) shots of a shirtless Seth Rogen. I'm glad, at least, they gave everyone what they were looking for: shirtless hunks, shirtless bears and potty humor for those who like neither of the above.Enjoy and cheers!* * *Final thoughts: I cannot spoil a lot of the cameos or references from this movie – they were all fantastic, but I will say my favorites were from the 1970s beer pong party as I love their TV show. That's all I'm saying about that.As for the references, my favorite was from the TV show I am currently finishing off today. Over the past two-weeks, I've first-time, binge- watched the entire series and it was extremely topical, for me at least, to reference this TV show at the very tale end of this movie. Again, no spoilers, but when you see it, know that I only had four episodes left – which, again, I will finish off today and I thought that was hilarious and cute.",Neighbors

26,Robert_duder,"Honestly, for being exactly what it presents itself to be...it wins in that regard.",7,23 May 2014,"So let me lay out my cards right here. I'm not a huge fan of comedies. I have a very specific taste when it comes to clever comedy. I hate Seth Rogen (yep its true, get over it) and I hate raunchy, stupid, unintelligent, toilet humour. Did I know Neighbors was going to be all that and more? You bet. I knew exactly what I was in for. I went because friends were going and I will watch pretty much anything. You cannot go into Neighbors and come out disappointed with what it gives you because it is exactly what it looks like. That is why I actually enjoyed it, laughed a little, and didn't hate every minute of it because I knew going into it what to expect and it delivers that in spades. It is pointlessly filthy, ridiculous juvenile, drug filled and outlandish but it has its moments where you can't help but laugh. To me American Pie was a brilliantly raunchy, actually smart comedy. There are no brains behind Neighbors at all. It is mindless. None of what I just said is meant to be a negative because you should know going to see this that is what it was made for. It did have slightly more of a story than I expected and a couple of surprisingly decent performances and its ridiculous. What more could you ask for? Seth Rogen...oh Rogen...the bane of my comedy existence. The man has made a name for himself by being a fat, disgusting stoner and I hate him for it. He is what's wrong with comedy and film making nowadays because everything he does lowers the intelligence scale just another notch. In Neighbors Rogen is...Rogen. He smokes dope, he talks with a slur, he looks stupid, he uses his weight as a comedy crutch and he is what everyone (except me) loves for Rogen to be. What else can I say? Rose Byrne is probably the highlight of this film. This is such an outrageously raunchy role for her and she seems so cute and awkward and yet she drops her F-Bombs and turns on the raunch matching every punch with Rogen and the rest of the cast. She was literally the reason to see this. Her and Rogen seem ridiculous together and yet somehow they work and that might be the best thing about this film. Zac Efron is really making an adult name for himself and for good reason. He is a good actor and a good comedian and he proves it again in this as the bull headed, macho jock leader of the fraternity. Efron and Rogen are decent together and their cat and mouse prank game that drives the film works well enough. The supporting cast are decent but they have specific points to their characters and they fulfil them dutifully. Dave Franco and Christopher Mintz-Plasse are decent but they're typical for this type of film and they are there to back up Efron. Mintz-Plasse is almost background fodder in this film. In any good comedy the ""buddies"" are vital however Ike Barinholtz and Carla Gallo are completely underused and almost unnecessary as Byrne and Rogen's best friends.Darn this movie because it has Seth Rogen and stupid comedy (which I hate) but blends together ridiculous physical comedy (which I love.) And you know what? The physical comedy (despite being WAY over the top) is hilarious. The airbag bit, Rogen's stumbling around like a buffoon...it works and I laughed. I would be lying if I said I loved this film, I didn't even come close to loving it but normally if someone said ""sit down and watch this"" I would have rolled my eyes and given it a big fat zero but I checked my expectations and looked for the good in it and there was some. Nicholas Stoller is relatively new to directing but already has some raunchy fun comedies under his belt and this should help solidify him as a comedy director. You will laugh and you'll roll your eyes and it is absolutely the definition of a ""stoner"" comedy. You MUST check your brain and all common sense at the door to even remotely enjoy it but lord help me...I did enjoy it. It was entertaining and I respect it for that. 7/10",Neighbors

Its story is simple, progressing pretty much exactly as you'd expect, but it offers up plenty of opportunity for comedic shenanigans and, as such, serves its purpose. Its characters, too, are particularly well realised, feeling much more realistic and rounded than those usually found in this sort of fare. It's a film without an agenda, one in which there are no real bad guys and the general message is good-natured. There are a couple of iffy jokes, but for the most part the humour is relatively smart, typically well-intentioned and often successful. The movie isn't hilarious but it provokes its fair share of laughs and it's always enjoyable to watch. It's affable and entertaining; that's all you really need. 7/10.",Neighbors
28,bowmanblue,Everybody needs bad neighbours,7,19 November 2014,"Do you like Seth Rogen? Basically, if you do, you'll probably enjoy 'Bad Neighbours' as much as you've enjoyed the rest of his output. If you don't like him, then there's not much here that will change your mind. Seth Rogen basically plays the same Seth Rogen-like character he does in every other film (with the possible exception of 'Observe and Report'). This time, he's married to Rose Bryne (yes, she's waaay out of his league, but, for the film's sake, we need to believe that she'd marry him) and they're living happily with the baby daughter in the leafy suburbs until a bunch of college students turn next door into a 'frat house.' Naturally, this is going to cause some tension and this provides the basis of the film, i.e. how the students attempt to wind up Seth and Rose, while, in turn, they do their best to get rid of their unwelcome neighbours.That's the story in a nutshell, but, what makes it very watchable, is the fact that the characters are pretty cool. Seth and Rose work well together and the audience will naturally always root for them. It would therefore be easy to turn the leader of the Frat house (Zac Efron) into a total villain. Yes, he's very full of himself and immature, but you can't help but feel he is a little deeper than just a loud-mouthed college jock. He does exhibit a sensitive side which gives the 'war' that ensues a little more balance.Plus, it's funny. I just thought I'd mention that as I seem to see more and more 'comedies' coming out of Hollywood that simply don't contain a single joke. The humour is 'adult' in nature and so you'll need to expect plenty of swearing and sex-gags. It's only an hour and a half long and that's plenty enough.So, if you're okay with Seth Rogen's style of comedy, plus you don't mind the strong adult humour, you should definitely enjoy spending an hour and a half in Seth, Rose and Zac's company.",Neighbors
29,ThomasDrufke,Typical Raunchy Rogen Comedy,7,11 May 2014,"This film came out exactly the right time of the year, as every frat boy is coming back from school and seeing a summer Seth Rogen comedy with their high school buddies. Along with 22 Jump Street this was the most anticipated comedies of the year. The trailers looked incredible but sadly showed most of the jokes ahead of time. Trailers are always risky for comedies because they want to make the movie as appealing as can be but at the same time don't want to show all the jokes. I enjoyed Neighbors, but while it's nowhere near the disappointment as hangover part 3, I think I can consider myself at least a little bit let down.There are some laugh out loud hysterical parts. Surprisingly the scenes involved Rose Byrne, and as far as I know this was her first comedic role. The breast-milking scene was deservingly the funniest scene in the entire movie. Rogen is always good at throwing these small one liners in and making it seem effortless along the way. Though you don't get to hear his iconic laugh much in this movie. Zac Efron was actually good in this role as well, he obviously breaks out of his Disney phase with this dirty comedy.I was very mad they showed both of the air bag scenes in the trailers. The narrative is the major weak point as it really doesn't have an intriguing story at all. The film has memorable scenes but the movie as a whole is nowhere as good as Pineapple Express, Superbad, 21 Jump Street, or even This Is the End. The build up led to a slightly disappointing movie that I think still can be called as a Jeremy Jahns deemed 'Awesometacular'. Efron and Byrne have a bright future in comedy, and Rogen is always Rogen.7.7/10",Neighbors

31,g-bodyl,The Battle of Neighbors!,8,28 March 2015,"Neighbors happens to be quite a funny movie for the most part, although there are several juvenile moments which were hit-or-miss. I recently graduated from college, so I thought this film is relatable in terms of fraternity parties and how they can be bothersome. Anyhow I found the film to be quite amusing whether is was the frat throwing a Robert De Niro party or whether it was a baby chewing a condom, but this movie has all the jokes the college kids can respect. Nicholas Stoller's film is about a couple in their early 30's who are thrilled when they get neighbors, a fraternity led by the hotshot Teddy. Teddy is quick to make friends with Mac and Kelly to receive their support. Teddy promises to keep things quiet, but he backtracks that promise which causes Mac to call the cops on them thus sparking a neighborly war. Seth Rogen is his usual self in this movie and that is not necessarily a bad thing. I thought Rose Byrne was excellent. I do not usually see her in these sort of comedies, but she should stick with them. Zac Efron actually impressed me with his performance, an exact opposite of his High School Musical performance. Dave Franco also delivered the goods as Teddy's right-hand man. Overall, Neighbors is a pleasing comedy for the most part. There are some juvenile moments (ahem baby condom joke), but there are many moments where I could not control my laughing (De Niro joke). The movie plays out a theme about how frats can be bothersome and in all honesty, they can be. It is really nice to see Efron take on something out of his wheelhouse and same as Byrne. A not perfect, but a solid comedy.My Grade: B+",Neighbors

Does that make it a bad film? Not necessarily, but it is not for everyone.Personally, I prefer my humor to be a little more intelligent. But the real problem with this film is its story. It feels rather disjointed, like a sequence of skits. One might criticize ""Animal House"" for being that way, too, but ""Animal House"" was mining new territory, so it gets points for originality.Rose Byrne does a pretty good job as the wife of Seth Rogen--the young parents who must endure the rudeness of their fraternity neighbors. But the best part of the movie was the set of twins who played their infant daughter.

37,ironhorse_iv,"Don't mean to be a party pooper, but Bad Neighbors was indeed pretty badly done. The Frat Humor was really flat.",6,11 May 2014,"This movie was no Animal House! Directed by Nicholas Stoller, Neighbors or Bad Neighbors known internationally isn't that funny. Originally titled Townies; the movie is about Mac Radner (Seth Rogen) and his wife Kelly (Rose Byrne), trying to raise their newborn daughter in a quiet neighborhood. It was going well, for them, until one day, the couple, finds out that Delta Psi, a fraternity known for their outrageous parties, has moved next door. Leaded by Teddy Sanders (Zac Efron) and Pete Regazolli (Dave Franco), the fraternity is searching for the ultimate party that would give them, short-term fame. After a few loud parties, Mac and Kelly ask them to keep it down, only to have Delta Psi begin to constantly haze Mac and Kelly to dangerous lows. I have to say, the movie is just big irritating movie that really wants to push your buttons. The fraternity are certainly not the heroes, nor the really bad immature and irresponsible parents, Mac & Kelly who love to party hard, too. I get it, Kelly and Mac haven't yet quite accepted that parenthood will mean the end of their old, irresponsible life. It wasn't until meeting the frat, that they realize that. Still, just think if the parents were actually responsible adults conflicting young frat boys; it might be a lot better. Instead, both camps are really just horrible dumb unlikeable people for the most part. Honestly, I lost all respect for both characters half way through the film, as I couldn't root for any of them. Attempted murder & threats to a New Born Baby was just too dark for me to find funny. I know some comedies wouldn't fit in the tone of logic, but the movie tries really hard to be realistic, here, but fails badly. It's hard to believe that no one in the neighbor would mind their obnoxiously loud, all-night parties, besides the Mac's family. It defy logic even more with the movie lame excuse on not calling the cops. The movie even set up a theme about growing up and taking adult taking responsibility that somehow gets lost due to its skit to skit plot line. It was so disjointed that it barely manage to retain some vestige of a plot. Don't look for any smart or cleaver humor, here. Most of them are really cretin. The film camera work is pretty awful in the party scenes. It looks and felt like a really bad trip, with light potentially, that could trigger seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy. Add the large amount of nudity, drugs use, and drinking that make you feel dirty for watching it. It's rated R, but feels more like a NC-17 film. Honestly, it's was made painful like a hangover, when you think how mean spirited and degrading, everybody is. There is a considerable amount of profanity that doesn't make it funnier. This comedy shows a lot of crude humor from a frat guy has his penis around a girl's neck, circle jerking, to a baby eating a condom, but for me, it was more misses than hits. None of it is in good taste and many will be offended many people. I do have a sense of humor, and find certain toilet humor, funny, but Seth Rogen pothead, perverted style of humor has gotten old, and felt out of place here. Don't get me wrong, Seth Rogen is definitely funny in certain movies. It's obvious that he doesn't appeal to everyone taste, but this was a void of humor. Talk about art imitating life, Zac Efron during filming had to go to rehab stint for substance abuse. I don't know if I call his acting, great. I don't really hate the guy. Efron seems to be playing a simple water down version of himself; here. Relying on good looks and charm rather than any real talent to make his way in the world. Rose Byrne is well-used in her role, but there was an oddly place, fake looking milking scene, that wasn't really needed to enforce the main plot. It just serve as an excuse for a gross-out. Another character, oddly place is Christopher Mintz-Plasse. I really don't remember any funny moments from him, at all. I do have to say, a character really noticeable is Ike Barinholtz as Jimmy. He really made the movie, fun for me. I do have to say, the baby Stella played by the Vargas Twins are just cute and adorable. I wish, they feature more of the baby into the plot, as it's seem really odd for the baby able to sleep well, during most of the loud parties. It seems that both Mac & Kelly were pretty neglectful of the baby, during these parties' revenge scenes. It seem the plot was hardly about the baby, but saying it was. Honestly, the ending was pretty cheesy. Without spoiling too much of it, I really don't see Mac & Teddy ever being friends again. Come on, he threaten your family, Mac!!! Overall: Mediocre as hell. If you saw the trailer. You saw the best bits of the film. While the humor, mostly appeal to the high school/college audience. I do believe that the jokes could had been retouch a bit, to appeal to a wider audience.

38,The-Sarkologist,Fear of responsibility,8,12 May 2014,"A part of me is wondering why it is that I go to these types of movies, and why I sit in the cinema laughing out loud. I sort of question myself as to whether I really should be exposing myself to lude, crude, rubbish such as this. What is strange though is that I have enjoyed similar movies such as We're the Millers and This is the End. Maybe it has something to do with the culture that it portrays, and reminds me of my own days wondering through the drug culture. I also wonder if I will continue to go an see such movies, or whether I will end up growing out of them. To be honest, and I can appreciate people not liking the crude nature of this movie, to me such movies, in a way, allow me to laugh at myself in what I used to be and no longer am.There have been criticisms about the parents in this film in that having a couple such as them undermined much of the comedy because they were not the puritanical parents that one would expect in such a movie, and I can, in a way, appreciate that aspect of it, but to be honest with you I do not think the movie would have been anywhere near as good if the parents were your average middle class parents living in suburban America. In fact, what we have is probably two groups of people who are very close in age but at different stages of life. The frat boys are in university and some of them are in their final year and are looking towards their working career, while the neighbours have probably only been out of University for a couple of years, have recently married and had their first child and are discovering that life is no longer the endless parties that they were used to.In a way this film is a coming of age movie in a somewhat different form. The frat boys are confronted by the neighbours because, in reality, they are no different to them (as is evident when they share the drugs and join in the party at the beginning) except the neighbours are now forced to work in the real world and to interact with real people, and in a way that scares them. In fact the head of the fraternity, as the film comes to a close, is told that the reason he hates them is because he knows that this is where he must go and it scares him. In a way he simply does not want to grow up.What the neighbours represent is the fact that just because you have entered the real world you don't have to give up everything that made life worth living. They still went to the party, and they still smoked Marijuana. They even dressed the baby up as Walter White for a rather interesting calendar (and watching the baby suck on the blue 'ice' was also quite amusing). However, it also comes out with the choices that you made. I remember partying at one of the houses that I lived in, and some of these parties were pretty massive. However these parties were not every night (though sometimes I wanted them to be) and we had fun, however we have now grown up, and I guess it is time to move on (though I guess it might be tempting to have another party sometime).",Neighbors

I never enjoyed Zac Efron's presence in any movie. I consider him one of the worst, according to my taste in actors and their performances. And again this movie crashed down because of him, otherwise somehow it could have been an enjoyable flick, especially with the stars like Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne in it.These two guys tried to lift it up, but the other side of the story failed. The two unmatched set of the cast that did not pay off as one as what the audience wanted, the fun. So it is kind of mixed feeling to me about the movie like half enjoyed.

The direction which was made by Nicholas Stoller was very good and he presented very well his main characters along with their personal stories. The interpretations of Seth Rogen who played as Mac Radner, Rose Byrne who played as Kelly Radner and Zac Efron who played as Teddy Sanders were very good and the characters connected really good between them and the plot.

41,zkonedog,Seth Rogen MAKES This Movie,6,3 March 2017,"About once a year or so, I'm down for a raunchy, ""party"" comedy. Some of them are truly horrible and I feel worse for the experience. Some, though, like ""Neighbors"", actually have enough thought put into them to be a fun outing.For a basic summary, this movie tells the story of new parents Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly (Rose Byrne). When a frat house gang led by Teddy (Zac Efron) moves into the house next door, a chain of one-upmanship hilarity begins in the ""battle for the neighborhood"".Simply put, what makes this movie funny is Seth Rogen. The guy plays the same character in practically every movie he's ever been in (or at least that I've seen!), yet it continues to work because it is so relatable. He's the slightly-pudgy ""average joe"" who has the perfect one-liners and sly comments that we all wish we could come up with on a daily basis! Without his unique brand of humor, this would be a ""lost ship"" of a film.Basically, if you've seen ""Knocked Up"" and enjoyed it, watch this one too and expect similar results. It's the same type of schtick, only with Rogen playing a slightly more mature version of his role in that earlier film. If you don't like crude (often extremely so) humor and hundreds of pot jokes, then stay away.""Neighbors"" gave me some good laughs in the theater and took my mind off the everyday grind for an hour and forty minutes.

The film draws connections between the two house, new parents Mac and Kelly Radner (Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne) secretly crave their old wild lives, while the boys at Delta Psi look at their brotherhood as a sort of stable home environment. Neighbors at first seems to string along many unconnected pieces then eventually we see he first connection come along and start to process as the film goes along. It is a silly comedy and many of the negative reviews seem to have complaints about this. It isn't trying to be a masterpiece or anything special but what t does, it works and there are a specific audience for these kinds of comedy.",Neighbors
43,eddie_baggins,A fast paced and often laugh out loud comedy,7,8 May 2014,"You've certainly got to hand it to Sir Seth Rogen and his ever willing and expanding group of cronies who have made quite a successful habit of turning one-note films into entertaining, critically accepted and normally financially successful comedies that play to the low brow and proudly so, and with Bad Neighbours (or Neighbors in various other countries) there is no change to that formula. This is a film that whilst not likely to make it's way into classic Superbad or This is the End territory is still a highly enjoyable comedy that provides a high frequency of laugh out loud moments.Playing off from a very bare bones story of a new to parenthood couple verses a bunch of party loving college students, Get Him to the Greek helmer Nicholas Stoller keeps the story moving at a fast pace and cares very little for character development or progression instead focusing on the next gross-out moment (a milking incident springs to mind here) or scene with a shirtless Efron (surely some CGI touch-ups were applied to this mans body?). With such a consistent pace it's hard to truly care much for these people like we did in say Knocked Up, or again Superbad, but everyone in the film has enough natural charisma to carry the plot, with Rogen again possessing some unique man-child like ability to make us like an immature late 30′s type man and Australia's very own Rose Byrne again shows us why she has become one of our most successful Hollywood exports. It's in the form of the college led cast that the film loses some of it's edge.Undoubtedly a financial win for the filmmakers, Zac Efron try's and almost succeeds at being the arrogant and daft leader of the college crew but his Teddy is a pretty unlikeable and uninteresting player opposite other members of the frat and his partner in crime Franco doesn't do much more that repeat his 21 Jump Street role and therefore is pretty unlikable to. With these two being different versions of arrogant 20 year olds it's up to supporting players in the frat to take center stage and other bit players in the film to shine, and the film succeeds whenever many of the supports show up, with a large portion of the film's funniest moments coming from these elements. McLovin himself Mintz-Plasse gets some quite ""large"" jokes here that work well.Fast paced, filled with bad taste and low-common-denominator jokes (isn't that what we audiences like these days?) and with a good cast mix, Bad Neighbours is a film that is never dull and with an equally fast paced and loud soundtrack no one will be accusing the film of having quiet moments which is how comedies should be. With enough lough out loud moments and with another successful lead comedic turn from Rogen, fans of his ever increasing man child repertoire will be in for a treat and all haters of his previous work should stay as far away from this as possible. Bad Neighbours is forgettable comedy at it's finest and most meaningless, and there is something quite entertaining about that.3 and a half stolen air bags out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",Neighbors

Well, the movie supposed to be funny. But to be honest, I didn't laugh at all while watching it. Maybe during the fighting scene, but that's it. Too many sexual jokes, again not even funny, too many sexual imitations and too many parties. At some points the film did try to get a deeper grasp of the characters, but failed to carry that through. I guess Dave Franco and Rose Byrne were good enough, Seth Rogen was his well known self and Zack Efron was just cruising by, being hot and all, trying to get back his high school musical moments. And it is a same, because he can do much better than that. Now I think I saw somewhere that they are making a sequel, which is a really terrible idea, as I don't think there is much more to the story that wasn't covered or even worth being repeated.

45,leonblackwood,Hilarious in parts! 5/10,5,21 September 2014,"Review: This movie is more silly than funny. It's really far fetched but you can't help laughing at some of the scenes, like the part with the airbags, which was brilliant. I liked the chemistry between Byrne and Rogen and the little baby was really cute, but the storyline was way over the top. Basically, that's what made the film funny because it's harmless fun for the whole family, except for the little ones. The whole, how to get rid of the neighbours, concept does get out of hand after a while, but thats what people have grown to expect from a Seth Rogen movie. Anyway, I did enjoy the movie because of its light tone and the non-stop crazy drama between the two neighbours, but it's not anything amazing. Watchable!Round-Up: Seth Rogen has really become a bankable actor who can't seem to do any wrong. His movies always make quite a lot of money except for a couple of bad choices like The Green Hornet and the Guilt Trip but he always bounces back with a blockbuster. In this movie he is acting like he has in a lot of his earlier projects, but that's not to say that he isn't a great comedic actor. I would like to see him in a few serious roles, just to see how versatile his acting skills are. As for Rose Byrne, she really has blossomed after starring in Damages and I can't see her career slowing down anytime soon. Zac Efron's role really did suit him. It's good to see him play a decent comedic role after starring in so many romantic roles over the years. Anyway, on the whole, it isn't a bad film if you want a couple of laughs, and judging by the profit it made, it must have ticked all the boxes for audiences around the world.Budget: $18milion Worldwide Gross: $268millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there comedies about a neighbour and his wife who try there utmost to get rid of there noisy neighbours. 5/10",Neighbors
46,TheMovieDiorama,"Bad Neighbours is your standard American comedy filled with drugs, sex and alcohol.",6,25 February 2018,"Add a fraternity lead by a hot guy, an Australian hormonal mother and a chubby wannabe-hipster father. What do you get? Bad Neighbours. The old peace seekers versus the young noisy hooligans. Standard formula is standard. That is literally the plot. Yet, this allows creativity and innovation to be injected into the film to bring out the hilarity. Surprisingly, this has several funny moments (even after the nth viewing). Ranging from Robert De Niro impression parties (""are you talkin' to me?""), weird hazing sessions and a dance off to the background music of Flo Rida. Random, but somehow oddly amusing that does conjure up a few laughs. Some of the jokes are high on the profanity level and does tend to feel like a competition to see how much the film can gross you out. Grows tiresome unfortunately. Acting all round was functional. Zac Efron has come along way since High School Musical and luckily has good comedic timing. Sure he looks fantastic...heavenly...I would even say Godly, but he can act. Seth Rogen is Seth Rogen. Rose Byrne pulls in a more natural performance and is a personal favourite of mine. Aside from that, it never pushes itself to more than just a crude comedy. If you like that, then great. I however like wit and subtle humour. That's not to say I didn't enjoy this, in fact in terms of recent comedies this is ranked highly. Also, the air bag scenes had horrendous human CGI that just detracted from everything else. If you couldn't do it without CGI, don't do it at all...especially in a comedy like this that utilises many props to give that sense of authenticity. Slight nitpicks but they do amount to negatives towards the film. It's undeniably watchable and a good comedy, but its contents grows tiresome as the runtime goes on.",Neighbors
47,matthewssilverhammer,Humor and Heart Outweigh Unevenness,7,3 June 2014,"Neighbors mashes up three classic comedy genres: fraternity comedy, young family comedy, and the bickering neighbors comedy. Balancing all this could be a difficult task, but director Stoller handles each with aplomb and a ton of great laughs to boot. It's a fairly realistic look at modern day family life juxtaposed against the freeness of young adulthood, everyone learning how to grow up responsibly but freely. If only the story weren't so uneven and some of the jokes less juvenile; however, the underlying truths and the over-arching humor win out. It focuses on a young married couple with a newborn baby who've just bought a new house. Not long after settling in, the house next door becomes a frat house, led by Efron and Franco, who long to party hard enough to go down in Greek history. The casting from top to bottom is spot on. Rogen and Byrne actually play a couple that LIKE each other, and have a natural chemistry that produces many of the laughs. Efron, Franco and crew do some of their best work, convincingly balancing goofy with affecting. Most surprising is the great commentary: the futility of popularity, the strength in being one with your spouse. If only the story and plotting were just a bit tighter. Instead of forcing every joke, allow the story and characters to move along naturally. All of this adds up to a mediocre story filled with great comedic debauchery, which is enough of a reason to recommend it.",Neighbors
48,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Rather hysterical, and a generational snapshot",8,26 November 2014,"New parents take on frat boys in ""Neighbors,"" the latest dirty R-rated comedy from director Nicholas Stoller (""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" ""Get Him to the Greek"") and produced by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg's Point Grey Pictures. Yet what separates ""Neighbors"" from the heap has a lot to do with the script, written by novices Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O'Brien. Their unusual yet familiar concept results in a comedy accessible to both college guys and to 30-some-year-olds with babies along with everyone in between.Yes, you do need to move beyond the preposterous notion that a neighborhood would ever be zoned to allow fraternity houses to move in in order to enjoy this movie, but the comic treasure chest this premise opens is well worth it. Rogen and Rose Byrne (""Bridesmaids,"" ""Get Him to the Greek"") star as young parents Mac and Kelly Radner, who are adjusting to being homeowners and caring for human life, even if it requires having sex in random rooms of the house just to feel young and adventurous again. Of course when the Delta Psi fraternity moves in next door, the Radners feel their quiet adult life being threatened, while also not wanting to be the unhip couple that calls the cops when the noise gets too loud.After awkwardly befriending Delta Psi leaders Teddy (Zac Efron) and Pete (Dave Franco), the Radners betray the boys' trust when they call the cops, and a war is waged with the fraternity making the their lives miserable and the couple scheming of ways to get the fraternity kicked off campus.Naturally, these 30-somethings find themselves in situations they are way too old for, and anyone who's ever had a moment in which they feel like they can't party as hard as they used to will relate. Rogen and Byrne are hysterical together and their relationship is the backbone of the movie.Also, anyone in a fraternity or who has ever been in one will appreciate the way ""Neighbors"" exaggerates fraternity life, as there are some moments that show the brothers' bond and sensitivity. Of course the portrayal still perpetuates fraternity stereotypes, but we've at least moved beyond ""Revenge of the Nerds"" or National Lampoon depictions of all frat dudes being jocks. Efron and Franco are ideally suited to portray the ""modern bro,"" with Efron making a statement that the ""High School Musical"" days are far behind him.What will surely go most under-appreciated about ""Neighbors"" is the unusual tail-end Gen X vs. Millennial clash going on. Mac and Teddy's argument about who is Batman (for Mac, it's Michael Keaton, for Teddy it's Christian Bale) perfectly represents this divide in its most fundamental sense, as college kids today watched Christopher Nolan's trilogy throughout their formative years whereas to someone in their 30s, the original Batman films in the late '80s early '90s were those movies. Either way, until now there hasn't been a movie that pits such similar age groups against each other, with college guys striving to be legendary and nervous about their future and young adults clinging to whatever 20-year-old version of themselves they have left.So on the surface, ""Neighbors"" looks like (and very much is) a war between college kids and new parents, but it's actually an impressively spot-on depiction of generational struggles in 2014. The Macs and Kellys out there today don't see themselves the way parents of babies have been depicted on screen for ages. They identify with this couple, striving to be youthful and spontaneous while recognizing their responsibilities. With this in mind, I would not be surprised if older adults did not like this film very much.This truthful component of ""Neighbors"" won't be what those who see it remember most (it earns its ""R"" rating to be sure), but it adds surprising depth to a rather funny comedy that without these layers would've been entertaining enough anyway. Still, the ""realism"" here is what makes ""Neighbors"" actually funny rather than just playing for laughs, and it earns the film consideration as one of the year's best comedies.~Steven C Thanks for reading!

53,freemantle_uk,When two tribes go to war,7,14 May 2014,"The new comedy Neighbors (or known as Bad Neighbours internationally) is a film that wants to be both a frat boy/party film and a gross out comedy with mostly successful results thanks to the direction of Nicholas Stoller and some inventive gags to help Neighbors stand out.Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly (Rose Byrne) are a married couple who have just had a baby and settling down to suburban monotony. Their worst nightmare happens when the Delta Psi Beta fraternity moves next door and their President, Teddy (Zac Efron) wants to join the legends of the brotherhood and create something that would go down as party history. Soon war breaks out between the family and the frat as Mac and Kelly look for any way to get rid of the fraternity. Yet the fight puts some spark in the couple's lives.Neighbors winning feature is the gross out gags and violent slapstick as both male and female characters have eye watering moments involving anything from the penis to the breasts. The humour is crass but it's done very well, providing many moments of belly laughs as Stoller has a no hold barred approach to the gags. The humour is not for everyone, but fans of films like American Pie and Ted will enjoy it.A fine cast of comic talent was assembled, Rogen, Byrne, Dave Franco and Efron with his emerging comedy abilities. Even actors of high calibre such as Lisa Kerchow, Christopher Mintz-Plasse and Ike Barinholtz are involved in minor roles. Though Rogen somehow gets another unobtainable woman he works well with Byrne and he plays on his man-child persona as someone who wants excitement in some form. Efron and Franco do make a good double act and have a bromance, using plenty of energy with their roles. Franco does something very rare for him, he plays someone we can sympathise with.Stoller adds plenty of visual flair to comedy, using video talk and filmed footage on cell phones appearing on the screen, different filming styles to reflect different periods and events and a unique looking party, mixing dark lighting and fluorescent colours to make it visually distinctive.The writers Andrew J. Cohen and Brenden O'Brien ensure a theme of growing up is prevalent as Mac and Kelly juggle parenthood and their responsibilities and their want for excitement that they use to have and not wanting the consequences of either. The frat too have these issues, Teddy wanting to go down as a party legend whilst Pete (Franco) sees the bigger picture beyond college life. This is a film that blends comic exaggeration of the conflict and pranks whilst acknowledging the wider world of responsibilities the characters have. This is not like 2012′s Project X which lived in a moral vacuum where nothing matters more then partying and popularity.The physical and gross humour is strong, the verbal humour is more hit and miss. A particularly bad example is when Teddy and Pete go through many rhyming variants of 'Bros before Hos': a joke that was not that funny to start with and outstays its welcome. Cohen and O'Brien do more work by create a very episodic script, tying different comic set pieces together as the warring parties try to 'one up' each other than they do in creating a cohesive story. Neighbors does also take the occasional dark turn which is very out of place, one moment especially being when Teddy threatens Mac and Kelly.Neighbors is a crude and lude comedy that will please fans of that type of humour. It pushes the rude humour to creative levels. Some of the jokes are misses but there are enough big laugh moments to make Neighbors a worthwhile experience for its demographic.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com",Neighbors

55,dee.reid,"Like good ""Neighbors""...",8,10 June 2014,"2014's Nicholas Stoller-directed ""Neighbors"" is a riotous ""bromance"" comedy of the first degree. It stars America's favorite developmentally arrested man-child, Seth Rogen, who it would appear has finally passed the torch of chronic arrested development to his younger co-star Zac Efron (though in reality, the two are separated in age by less than a decade - but I must digress).Mac Radner (Rogen) and his beautiful wife Kelly (Rose Byrne) are new parents in a quaint college town. Their quiet life as new parents with their newborn baby girl Stella is interrupted when a rowdy fraternity moves in next door. Led by seniors Teddy (Efron) and his VP Pete (Dave Franco), these guys - who make the rowdy frat-boys in ""National Lampoon's Animal House"" (1978) look like amateurs by comparison - are out to throw the most epic party in their fraternity's history by the end of the school year, which causes problems for Mac and Kelly, who just want peace & quiet for themselves and Stella. Lewd jokes and pranks continue to escalate into a battle of wills from there as Mac and Kelly do everything in their power to get rid of Teddy and his fraternity.As would be expected, ""Neighbors"" pushes the envelope in many places. But like any good raucous ""R""-rated comedy of late, the lewd jokes, pranks, ""bromance,"" and meaningful subtext about man-children being dragged kicking & screaming into adulthood are what keep this thing moving forward. If this is your type of comedy, then ""Neighbors"" is custom-made for you. I know it was for me. Seth Rogen is one of my favorite stars of the moment. It's a nice role reversal to see him playing an ""adult"" (so to speak) for once, though we can still see some of the adult man-child in his character. And Rose Byrne also gets some of the best lines in the movie in the film's most prominent female performance. In fact, one of the most painful (and sublimely ridiculous) moments in the entire film is at her character's expense.I thought that the real charge here was Zac Efron as the couple's young nemesis Teddy. I mentioned earlier that the torch has been passed along somewhat from Rogen to Efron, the latter whose character Teddy soon realizes the painful truth that the party can't possibly go on forever. But nonetheless, the conflict that arises between Mac and Teddy does unexpectedly yield into a friendship by film's end, being that the two get to revel in a brilliant physical joke just before the credits roll.8/10",Neighbors

58,meeza,Worthy enough I guess to go ahead and knock on this Neighbors' door,7,13 October 2014,"The comedy ""Neighbors"" had its uproarious moments, especially the Robert DeNiro impersonation scene, that was really talking to me with laughter. However, it did get a bit outlandish throughout the third act of the film. Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne star as Mac & Kelly Radner, a young couple with a baby daughter who find out that their new neighbors are a party-animal crew of fraternity brothers led by Zac Efron''s character Teddy. Teddy just can't bear the nose complaints from his neighbors and neighboring feud havoc follows.

59,drqshadow-reviews,"A Very Simple, Funny Premise That Fails to Stretch Itself",6,5 January 2015,"Seth Rogen continues his comic tour of middle life, as a new father fighting the impending realization that youth culture has escaped him. The arrival of a party-all-hours fraternity in the vacant house next door hammers that point home, and when Rogen pulls the ultimate grown-up move (calling the cops at 4am) it quickly ignites an escalating game of one-upsmanship with the chapter president (Zac Efron). It's the very definition of one-note, like a ninety minute sketch from SNL, but at least it plays that key admirably. Rogen's usual mix of snarky one-liners, aging stoner tropes and gross-out payoffs are spread thick like a jar of Jiffy, but it all still feels fresh enough and he gets a lot of help from Rose Byrne in a hilarious supporting role as his let's-throw-down spouse.

61,alindsay-al,A great comedy that adds to this groups collection,8,20 February 2015,"I am a bit fan of Seth rogen comedies and I finally got a chance to see this film and I think it is great. The premise of this film sees a married couple with a newborn child who have a frat house move in as there new neighbours. A battle commences between the two groups for neighborhood superiority. Some people criticise Seth rogen of just being the same character in everything but he does it so well that I love it. He is great in this film and funny as always His chemistry with Byrne and efron really carry this film. Zach efron has had an interesting career to say the least but I truly believe that this is the breakthrough performance that he needed. His character is really funny but he also manages to make his character sympathetic which is a big thing considering he is the bad guy in the film and that takes acting talent. I have always known that rose Byrne is funny but this was the film where you truly see that, she is just really cool and a woman that you would love to hang out with. I do feel a little sorry for Dave Franco because it is clear that he is the weaker of the two Franco actors but he was funny in this film and he did the annoying character well. The story was okay I mean I liked the characters in it and also the ranking aspect worked. But I felt like there wasn't enough drama in the film to make us care more about the characters. The script is great with allot of quick witted dialogue that made these characters fun and easy to get along with. The style worked for this film with the absurd levels of action working however, there are some parts of the film that are so absurd that it takes you out of the film. Overall this is a great comedy and if you are a fan of these types of comedies then you should see this film.",Neighbors
62,estebangonzalez10,Not as funny as I expected,5,8 July 2014,"""Do you think maybe we've gone too far? I'm a child of divorce and I sympathize with them.""I don't think director Nicholas Stoller nor screenwriters Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O'Brien went too far with the comedy in Neighbors considering it felt like a rehash of hundreds of raunchy comedies we've seen before. I was expecting a much funnier film considering Neighbors has a talented cast and it was warmly received by critics and audiences alike. Unfortunately, I laughed very little and was disappointed with how un-engaging the story and characters were. Seth Rogen is a hilarious guy, but there have been some rare occasions were I really didn't find him all that funny, and that was the case with Neighbors. Surprisingly I did enjoy Zac Efron and Rose Byrne's performances. They had the funniest scenes in the movie, but I just felt those scenes were too far spread out and that as a cohesive whole the film failed. I enjoyed Nick Stoller's previous comedies although I think his best one was his feature debut, Forgetting Sarah Marshall. With Neighbors, Stoller is taking a step down and giving us a comedy with no emotional attachment or interesting characters. Neighbors has plenty of obscene and vulgar humor, but I just didn't find it funny.Neighbors centers on a couple who have just moved to a quiet neighborhood with their young baby girl. Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly Radner (Rose Byrne) are enjoying their married life and trying to adapt to grown up life now that they have a child. Things take an unexpected turn when frat brothers move in to the house next door. Teddy (Zac Efron) is the president of the fraternity and his right hand man is Pete (Dave Franco). At first Mac and Kelly warmly welcome the frat brothers trying to act as the friendly and cool young couple. They even accept an invitation to party with them, but after several nights of heavy partying and loud music, Mac and Kelly can't take it anymore. They try to politely ask for the guys to turn the volume down, and when their request is ignored they call the police. Feeling betrayed for being rated on, the frat brothers declare war on the young couple and pretty soon one cruel act is responded by another as they go back and forth trying to outdo one another. The comedy didn't really work for me although I have to acknowledge some scenes that I found hilarious. My favorite scene was the one in which the frat brothers were having a Robert de Niro themed party, quoting some of his famous lines (""You talking to me?"" ""You've broken the circle of trust"") from his movies. The closing scene at Abercrombie and Fitch was also hilarious, although I heard it was unscripted. There are few loose scenes like these that save the film, but as a whole I just found it boring and uninspiring. Rose Byrne is the real star of this film and she does steal every scene she's in, but it just wasn't enough for me.",Neighbors

This is moderately more funny if you are a parent as you have the perspectives of: wish I could go out and live it up but I can't because I have an infant at home and let's be cool with the young neighbors because even though we are older, we are still cool.

It's certainly hard to argue with success, but after watching 'neighbors' I'm starting to think that it may be time for Rogen to stretch his wings a little.While the set-up here is pretty straightforward and uninspired, it does serve to hold together a string of amusing, occasionally laugh-out-loud funny gags.

The casting is perfect, and I thought that all the actors nailed their roles. Zac Efron is the perfect choice for the beer can crushing typical frat guy. He has that believable college party dude essence about him. And he doesn't look too bad either. This quote in the beginning of the film is very true. ""He looks like something a gay guy created in a laboratory!"" And as a gay guy I can say that yes that's very true lol. Seth Rogen is a great comedic actor and he does well as the new father who still wants to live out his younger days and becomes obsessed with battling the next door fraternity.

And omg Lisa Kudrow (Friends) has a small role as dean of the university the fraternity is associated with. She is hilarious as usual, one of my favorite actors ever! The comedy works very very well, this is one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen actually. I really suggest that if you're looking for a great well made comedy then I 100% suggest Neighbors!

The Robert De Niro party idea is wasted, and editing in the last 30 minutes makes no sense... where are the other neighbors which logically would make up a subplot, and half the movie is spent with the audience asking ""where is the baby""... Dave Franco must have busted the casting couch in Hollywood to get this part, and the talent of the terrific Zac Efron is again wasted. This is crude ugly film. Stupid and unfunny.

70,aharmas,They should refund our money and time,1,11 May 2014,"There was promise in the premise of two opposites dealing with a too close for comfort situation. Sadly, every single element here is the worst of the worst. From the writing, to the non existent ""comedy"", to the horrible casting choices and the lack of chemistry in many of the different couples here. It's hard to feel any empathy for the old couple, or even believe any of the brothers were really fond of each other, and the unbelievably stupidity of the script dragged everyone to even lower levels. This was one time when one was wishing for negative numbers to be used for ratings here.Seth Rogen, usually a very likable everyday type only annoys everyone from the beginning, and Gowan can't lend any credibility to her role as the wife of this loser. This is probably to the fact she has always played women who are either a plain Jane type or have the ability to manipulate or deceive those around them. She doesn't seem capable of showing any degree of sexiness, and the dialog she has been given makes the situation more ludicrous than ever.Here comes Zach who doesn't fare as badly, but there is still nothing he can do with the horrible puns, lines, and directions, if we can call them given to him by whoever was directing this mess. Sitting through this is probably the equivalent of water torture, medieval sadism, or something worse. It was torture for the sense because of the endless barrage of vulgarity, ineptitude, and huge amounts of contempt for those in the audience. It was offensive in so many levels with its visual display of scenes that deserve an NC-17 more than an R.

We have seen it before, and it has been at least entertaining or done in a creative manner to suggest an action, rather to give unnecessary graphic imagery. What is happening here? We had ""The Watch"" and their obsession with male private parts and scatological jokes, then ""The Wolf"" came along, and we were supposed to believe drug abuse was good cinema, and now this came to top everything else.

71,aidanratesmovies,A Most Underrated and Misunderstood Comedy- Byrne and Efron shine,10,27 August 2020,"Hilarious, profane, and by all means inappropriate- many may miss the point of this fast paced college comedy- but to all those who find the humor funny, it's an absolute blast. First off, I want to talk about the casting of this film, which is on point. So many comedies have great leads and big named actors attached to them, but few make as good use of them as this one does. I have never been a huge fan of Zac Efron or Rose Byrne, but after watching this film, I have come to love their performances here. Efron plays his role as the antagonist with great taste, and Byrne plays more than just a damsel or angry mother, and seems like a far more rounded character than most comedies are willing to put the time into. Rogen is good as always, providing many clever gags, and hilarious lines, as well as Dave Franco moving from his high school role in 21 Jump Street to this college centered flick. As for the flaws of this film, I did feel one scene was a bit out of place, and kinda flawed the overall tone of the film. I won't go into specifics, but to those who watch and pay attention, you'll find it. I also did feel a couple of transitions were a bit choppy, and didn't seem as clean as they could have been, as if they ran out of time and/or money to truly put their all into the editing process for the film. In the end though, Neighbors was an absolutely hilarious and well cast comedy that I wouldn't mind watching again sometime.
My Rating: 9.5/10",Neighbors
72,Amari-Sali,"As with most Seth Rogen movies, the comedy is about the oddness of close male relationships, jackass style violence, and somewhere amongst that is character development.",8,26 May 2014,"Whenever Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg come together, usually magic happens. The only exception being The Guilt Trip, and maybe The Watch as well. Otherwise, they are comic masterminds. They will use this bromance culture and push jokes about intimacy between men to the point it almost seems like homophobia. Then, of course, there are the jokes in which you look at these grown men, the people who seemingly have too much of a love for Will Ferrell, who are seemingly are always on the brink of something. Be it the brink of adulthood, in this movie; the brink of realizing they may have outgrown their friends, like in This Is The End; and in each Seth Rogen movie, and maybe Judd Apatow as well, you can see people on the brink of a major life change trying to get one last hoorah before they have to settle for normalcy. And this movie is no different.Characters & StoryMac and Kelly Radner (Seth Rogen & Rose Byrne), have just had baby around 6 months ago, and now have a new home to really perfect their little family. Thing is though, with them having a family comes the idea that they can't be fun anymore. They can't go out with party girl/ best friend Paula (Carla Gallo) or creepy best friend Jimmy (Ike Barinholtz) because they have a baby. But then a fraternity, Delta Psi, ran by Teddy (Zac Efron) and Pete (Dave Franco) move in next door.Now, when they first move in, Mac and Kelly have mixed feelings about them moving in. But, with Teddy trying to win them over, he invites them for a party and things get pretty weird, but overall Teddy bonds with Mac, and things seems cool. However, when one party gets too loud and Teddy doesn't pick up the phone to hear how Mac wants them to turn it down because its 4AM and he has work and a baby, they call the cops and this breaks the circle of trust.From there, it is an utter war between the two houses, featuring lots of comedic moments, but with an underbelly dealing with the issues of adulthood. Mac and Kelly get a thrill out of going back and forth with Delta Psi, Kelly especially who comes up with some of the biggest comebacks, and you realize that this whole thing is their last big hoorah before they have to settle down to be some type of example for their daughter. As for Pete and Teddy, Pete is on his way to become something, and since his parents seemingly had a nasty divorce, Delta Psi, and Teddy especially, really create a stable family environment he feels loyal to. Then, when it comes to Teddy, he seemingly is trying to get one last hoorah just like Mac and Kelly, if only because he isn't capable of growing up yet. His GPA is a 2. something, and while Pete is going places, Teddy seemingly puts all his efforts into the frat. Making for a film which tries to balance a revenge plot with four people scared and anxious about what it means to be an adult.Praise54 laughs for a 97 minutes movie isn't that bad in my opinion, and while the jokes are certainly not the kind which may make you think, you will be laughing to the point of maybe getting a headache from the lack of air in your chest. Efron and Franco seem like a match made in bromance heaven, and their relationship in the movie is just as close and intimate as Rogen and Byrne's. Their friendship, even without a huge amount of details, you can see it as what grounds the other person, and even when a girl almost gets between them, they try to work through the issue. And while the film is essentially a comedy, I do appreciate how like This is The End and Bad Grandpa, there is an attempt at a deeper storyline amongst all the jokes.CriticismThing is, unlike Bad Grandpa and even This is The End, the attempt at creating a slightly deeper story isn't that smooth. It is good enough to get the point across, and allows Efron especially to get some good scenes, but considering how far the jokes go, it is hard to really listen to Efron's problems with getting serious about post grad life, as well as some of his issues with Franco's character, and really take it seriously. If just because the time line of the movie feels rushed so when Pete betrays Teddy's trust, they fight and makeup within a day. When Kelly and Mac fight, and Kelly leaves Mac, again, they get back together within a day. So, it is like these moments when things get real are just there to give you a moment to catch your breath than to really, properly, evolve the characters.Overall: Worth SeeingAdmittedly, I am leaning toward saying this is TV viewing, but the jokes are what push this film toward me thinking it is worth seeing. For while the jokes are the usual style of a Seth Rogen or Jonah Hill movie, their shtick, to me anyway, hasn't gotten old yet. I must admit though, I do feel the amount of jokes and comedy are made to compensate for a rather basic story which has the potential to give us flawed and interesting characters, but rather make you laugh than really allow us to understand the issues and reality of the characters. But, at the same time, not every film should be planned out to be a dramedy right?",Neighbors

75,jadepietro,There Goes the Neighbor Hood,7,14 May 2014,"This film is recommended.Conflict has been the basis for most prose, be it the tragic plays by Shakespeare or more contemporary work like Tennessee Williams' The Glass Menagerie, or the comedic work of Chaplin or the Marx Brothers. Drama and comedy are a mere coin flip away from each other. Which takes us, surprisingly, to the recent gross-out comedy, Neighbors, a film that sets up its menacing premise to mine its comic potential. No Shakespeare it ain't, but it is fun.￼The menagerie in question is a frat house that sets up residence in a family-friendly neighborhood and creates havoc upon the young married couple next door. The formula is Animal House meets Revenge of the Nerds vs. Knocked Up, the latter movie also starring Seth Rogan. In Neighbors, Rogan takes on the more ""mature"" role of Mac, a young father and doting husband to Kelly (a deft Rose Bryne). Their perfect world become unhinged when the frat pack moves in, bringing with it a large assortment of dysfunctional louts, headed by their leader, Teddy (Zac Efron).￼As tensions escalate between the neighbors, the film ratchets up the gross-out humor with mixed results. There are far too many topical pop references that will date the movie for future generations, but most of the jokes work well, thanks to the interplay of the performers involved. The two lead actors use their screen personas to fine advantage: Rogan as the overweight common man / child and Efron as the hedonistic stud. They have a strong chemistry and their physical differences reinforce the contrast between those characters quite effectively. Adding fine comic support are the aforementioned Ms. Bryne as Mac's frustrated wife, Ike Barinholtz, Lisa Kudrow, and Dave Franco.￼Director Nicholas Stoller takes this formulaic comedy and skillfully creates a highly entertaining film, avoiding a sitcom appearance. Part of the film's success is due to a clever script by Andrew J. Cohen and Brendan O'Brien that wisely establishes some character development instead of depending solely on sophomoric humor and gross-out gags. Yes, the raunchiness and sex jokes are there in full force, along with the overuse of profanity, but it is tempered with some genuine moments of humor and charm.￼The comic energy of Neighbors does dissipate and tends to peter out by the film's end, but the laughs are plentiful amid the hijinks and slapstick in this film.

76,Seraphion,The jokes are sometimes lame even disturbing,5,12 May 2014,"The story follows Mac and Kelly, a young couple with their newly born kid Stella, living in a normal American suburban neighborhood. One day a group of fraternity college students move in next door. At first the couple are okay with them, but the constant partying to late at night and the over-bearing sounds the frats make just make them had enough. The couple tried telling them nicely to no avail. But the frats take it as vengeance when the couple called the police on them. After enduring mischiefs and pranks, the couple with aid of some friends then decide to tear the frat from the inside. They make a truce and join one of the parties. There they succeeded in creating a conflict between Teddy and Pete, the frats' top members. But the frats gets over the conflict and redirect their effort again to the couple. The couple then again tried their strategy, to the ultimate time, by planning to magnify the frats' party to a level so big then call the police on them.The frats realize this too late but manage to regain control of their own party and sending away the unwanted guests as the police comes. But Mac and Kelly managed to turn the party on again and as crowds rush back in, they pulled a prank on a police car. Teddy then takes the blame so Pete can scoot out.The story tries to cross the comedy sub-genres of family comedy and young adult/college comedy. Well, in my opinion the cross is successfully done, but I don't think the same at the choice of jokes. The college jokes are too practical and doesn't really convey any depiction of the whole college comedy scene. And the family jokes don't fare so well either. The air bag pranks are funny though they raise questions on how the pranksters could have any access to places they are reinstalled on. For me the drunk breast joke is too much of a 'disturbing picture' category. It's funny but the depiction is just too disturbing to see. There are quite many properties that can be incorporated into a joke that are not being developed in the movie. The baby for instance, just sit there as a baby to complete the scenes, but no jokes involving the baby at all.Well, for me the movie is not that good as it doesn't get to a funny movie entirely although it has many funny scenes. From another angle, it could viewed as depicting college students being bullies to others. My verdict is then it's a 5 out of 10 score for Neighbors (2014), but I do recommend you to go and see it. It can be funny, just don't expect it to be that entertaining.",Neighbors
77,burlesonjesse5,"Neighbors is hilarious, the best comedy of the year so far",7,9 May 2014,"As of this moment, I have now seen three films by British born director, Nicholas Stoller. His Forgetting Sarah Marshall strained for laughs while his 2010 effort Get Him to the Greek, was hampered by the annoyance of one Russell Brand. Now with his current release entitled Neighbors (no relation to the 1981 John Belushi flick), he finally breaks through by unleashing an uproariously funny, overly crude, yet very well plotted frat comedy. Now granted, it does have a weak, feel good ending and a slow, almost guffaw-free beginning. All things considered though, I'd say that the laugh ratio throughout this vehicle's 90 plus minutes is pretty darn high. And if you're wondering whether or not I left the theater with a big fat smile on my face, well the answer is a profoundly stark yes!Featuring a two part cameo by Friends alum Lisa Kudrow (where the heck has she been) and a scene in which a bunch of males make clay molds out of their genitalia (to raise money of course, how insightful), Neighbors follows the conflict between a married couple named the Radners (Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne as Mac and Kelly Radner) and chiseled up, professional college student Teddy Sanders (Zac Efron). You see, the married couple are full fledged adults. They have a kid, jobs, and a need for sleep. As for Sanders, well he's the president of a fraternity. He likes to throw loud, revolutionary frat parties and you guessed it, he's their next door neighbor. After a friendly meeting and a reasonable exchange of words, it all goes downhill when these two parties become constantly at odds with one another. Things get personal as they begin to pull pranks on each other (rather violent ones too), destroy each other's moral and eventually try to get one or the another kicked out of their respective domains. Something of note: mysteriously, it seems that only one house (the Radner house) is affected by the relentless noise and the late night rock n' roll lifestyle exhibited by these frat dudes. That notion is kinda put to rest when a scene occurs in which the frat regulars and pledges reluctantly pay off other neighbors so that no one will complain in the future. The movie never really tells you what the other neighbors are being paid off with. I mean, the fraternity in question doesn't have much money anyway so it doesn't make much sense. Right?Anyway, the casting consisting of actors/actresses who seem older than the parts they are playing, is pretty good but it's also sort of hit or miss. Seth Rogen is the ideal guy to be in a movie directed by Nicholas Stoller. He pretty much plays himself by once again doing the whole befuddled stoner bit (except now he plays a father with I guess, a five month old). Also, Rogen likes to improvise a lot and as evident by Stoller's previous work, improvisation is an absolute given. Then there is Rose Byrne and she is for the most part, appealing as Rogen's character's stay-at-home wife. We also get James Franco's little brother (Dave Franco) playing Pete Regazolli (the vice president of the fraternity, Delta Psi). His friendship with Efron's Sanders and their dialogue exchanges are a downright hoot (there's a scene where they elaborate on the adage of brotherhood coming before female companionship and it had me rolling in the aisle). They represent the best quote unquote, ""bromance"" that has ever been captured on film. Oh and did I mention Efron? Well he's just perfect playing the antagonist who has a zero GPA (it's mentioned halfway into Neighbors that he never goes to class) and doesn't want to venture into the real world after college is over. Zac appeared earlier this year in the clichéd flick entitled That Awkward Moment. He bounces back here with a role that shows that he really can indeed act.Now Neighbors, with its sometimes shocking bits of mild violence and amusing, well developed supporting characters (especially Franco as Efron's fraternity ally and Rogen's divorced friend played by Ike Barinholtz), could very well be the comedy of the year. Its only missteps involve the behavior of the parents by which the story is built around. First off, I didn't believe for a second, that Rose Byrne's Kelly Radner would ever marry or have a life (let alone a kid) with a dope like Seth Rogen's Mac. In the movie, we all find out that she is obviously from Australia so I'm thinking that when she came to the U.S., she settled for the first guy who hit on her (that's the only rational explanation I can think of). Also, I couldn't get over the fact that during a bunch of scenes where they go over to the Delta Psi house, this negligent couple ends up staying there for long periods of time (to get revenge of course). My question is what about their infant child who's all alone next door (you can't hear a baby monitor too well at a place where there's a lot of debauchery and loud noises)? Oh and what's up with Rogen's Mac going to an initial frat get together (to meet his new neighbors) only to end up in a situation where he eats shrooms and smokes large amounts of weed? Really? If the filmmakers are trying to depict him as a lousy parent, they're doing a heck of a good job.Regardless, Neighbors succeeds by making the viewer laugh without being too outlandish, too gross, and ultimately too offensive. It's the perfect blend of R rated comedy (despite what you might have heard from other moviegoers) and fleshed out humiliation. And dare I say that I plan on seeing it again. I mean, who wouldn't want to borrow sugar from these ""neighbors"" just one more time.",Neighbors

The trailer for NEIGHBORS seemed mildly amusing but it was Stoller's involvement that got me into a theater to watch it. So how was it? Not bad. It wasn't on the level with Stoller's best, but it was more fun than his last film, THE FIVE-YEAR ENGAGEMENT. Here, Stoller continues touching on a theme he hit on a bit in his last film: adulthood. Mac and Kelly Radner (Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne) are new parents who have invested all of their savings into their new home where they're hoping to start an idyllic life. Soon, a fraternity moves in to the vacant home next door and threatens their peaceful existence. At first, the frat president Teddy Sanders (Zac Efron) and his vice president Pete (Dave Franco) welcome the two of them in, giving them a refresher taste of college party life. But it all falls apart when Mac and Kelly call in a noise complaint one night, shattering the trust between the two houses and igniting a prank war that will test everyone's breaking points. But this war isn't about trust or revengeit's just a convenient distraction for Mac and Teddy to avoid facing reality.NEIGHBORS is a comedy so the most important question is: is it funny? Sure. Well, mostly. I wouldn't say it's as consistent as last year's THIS IS THE END, and its sense of humor achieves record levels of low-brow. Coming in to NEIGHBORS, expect plenty of genital gags and shock humor. Some of it lands, but some of it was met with an eye roll and a groan at their blatant attempts at reaching for ""oh-no-he-didn't!"" reactions. As with much of Stoller's work, NEIGHBORS also incorporates a lot of improvisation which, in the right hands, can be awesome but can also feel horribly forced when mishandled. There's some of both here. Rogen is arguably one of the best at modern dialogue improv in movies (say what you will but he hits more than he misses, and he's built a successful career on it) but he seemed like he was struggling to come up with material at times here. There are definitely spots where the improv ran unchecked and should've obviously been cut; a prime example is a moment later in the film when Teddy and Pete are bonding following a bromance-shattering party with alternating ""bros-before-hos"" lines and it falls apart fast. The scripted parts and plot points are, for the most part, hilarious and that's where the movie succeeds but NEIGHBORS probably could've done with some more discriminating editing to trim the fat. So is NEIGHBORS funny? Yeah, I'm sure it won't disappoint and you'll certainly find plenty to get you laughing.I think the most interesting part of NEIGHBORS is Zac Efron. Of all the talented (or semi-talented) cast in this movie, I never would've expected Zac Efron to be the funniest character. I'm not going to liegoing in to this movie, I still viewed Efron as a talentless pretty boy famous for garbage teen musicals from the Disney Channel I'd been forced to suffer when my niece would watch them. But, wow, I didn't give the kid enough credit. He's got a great sense of humor and he has a natural comedic timing that, in the end, made him my favorite character. Teddy is a buff, narcissistic moron who's spent his entire college life perfecting the art of the party while neglecting his studies. Efron is talented enough to give the character some depth and make it feel natural when it comes to light that he's dealing with the realization that he has absolutely nothing going for him when he enters the real world. Rogen is his counterpart, terrified of letting go of juvenile behavior and accepting adulthood. Rogen gives his usual performance, bumpy but effective. His charming schlub routine fits the character of Mac perfectly. Rose Byrne seems to have some trouble running with the improv crowd here. She was hilarious in Stoller's GET HIM TO THE Greek but she seems uncomfortable at times here with the open, directionless dialogue flow. Still, she has some great moments.NEIGHBORS probably won't find it's way onto any top ten lists but it's a fun, throwaway time at a mere 90 minutes. It's cheap laughs but I love that it tried to incorporate themes of growing up and it never felt shallow. And it established Efron (for me, anyway) as a comedy talent to follow and I hope he finds more roles in the Apatow/Stoller crowd. So turn off your brain, prepare for some childish erection gags, and enjoy. Delta Psi!",Neighbors
79,bkrauser-81-311064,Old School for the New School,7,10 May 2014,"It's a bittersweet moment when you realize you may be getting too old for the bawdy, gross-out, college humor comedies. The beer doesn't quite taste as sweet and the deafening party mix that used to jolt you into a street streaking frenzy has become, well just plain deafening. Forget going on a bender and living it up like its 1999, it's closer to 2019 now and you've got work in the morning.Seth Rogen's Mac Radner knows that feeling well. He's got a responsible big-boy job wearing khakis and filling out joint files and has put a lot of money into a new home for his wife (Rose Byrne) and child. Settling into a life of responsibility has felt uneasy as of late for the couple and the arrival of a new Fraternity house next door rattles the Radner's definition of themselves and their priorities. Can they make nice with the neighbors? Or will things ultimately lead to a chaotic confrontation. I don't think I'm spoiling anything by saying that the Radners and the boy of Delta Psi don't see eye-to-eye. What initially starts as an ""anonymous"" noise complaint turns into an escalating cycle of recycled youtube pranks and crafty manipulations, most of which is highlighted in the trailer.To their credit Rogen and Byrne have great chemistry as the young couple and for their efforts Zac Efron, Dave Franco, Jerrod Carmichael and Christopher Mintz-Plasse do on-screen wonders as the offending frat. The gags are effective in what ends up being a boilerplate raunch-comedy and the message while rudimentary was received by the audience I saw the film with. It's not much of a stretch to say Neighbors (2014) is a good movie and a solid comedy so if you're an 18 to 35-year-old fine with low hanging fruit I say give it a go.Perhaps it's a testament to my age that all I kept thinking of were other films that have done this sort of thing first and better. Animal House (1978), Revenge of the Nerds (1984), The 'Burbs (1989), Changing Lanes (2002); all pilfered by director Nicholas Stoller and scribes Andrew Cohen and Brendan O'Brien for the sake of a pedestrian ode to college life. And don't kid yourself, for all the revelry Neighbors has in store, on the whole the ceremonies are pedestrian. Even Old School (2003) had the good sense to have Will Ferrell streak. What will Neighbors's legacy be to the throngs of pop-culture consumers? Jerrod Carmichael's pubic hair torn out by plaster? The brinksmanship of two neighbors at war never reaches its full potential, culminating in a confrontation that is less hilarious than it is wincing. If I wanted to see an out of shape man getting his butt kicked by an inept Abercrombie & Fitch model I'd see Here Comes the Boom (2012) again. The most volatile rifts in this Judd Apatow-less feature are concocted by Rose Byrne's character who decidedly does more damage with more success than any of the bros in this movie. Unfortunately her contributions to the chaos serve only further the plot not necessarily to get the belly laughs going. In addition to playing a mean Iago, she's also the subject of one of the movie's most memorable gross-out gags which ended up only being sporadically funny and ultimately pointless.At one point in the movie Rogen and Byrne lay in bed contemplating the future. Rogen asks ""Do you think we'll make good parents?"" to which Byrne replies ""I think we'll be good and bad parents."" It's moments like this that make Neighbors ultimately worth a watch. There's genuine heart and thought put into the characters, even those on the other side of the fence. Yet without any animosities really reaching a fever pitch or any gags not in the trailer reaching new heights, you might have to acknowledge this frat pack might fall flat for those with allegiances to better party school films.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",Neighbors
80,moviexclusive,"To our surprise, there is quite a bit of heart in this f***in' hilarious comedy",8,10 May 2014,"The year was 2006 – street cred wasn't the first thing you'd associate us with if we told you we were fans of High School Musical. The Disney Channel TV movie was a fine example of a guilty pleasure. We couldn't stop listening to the soundtrack, singing along to stars Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens' duet ""Breaking Free"". The successful hit made stars out of the former real life couple. Two sequels followed, the two broke up and life happened. While Hudgens wasn't at fortunate, Efron went on to, well, win a Best Shirtless Performance at the recent MTV Movie Awards.Yay? The 26 year old actor embodies the term ""guilty pleasure"" (for female viewers at least). And that was why we thought this Nicholas Stoller directed comedy might turn out to be a bland concoction of a few chuckle worthy jokes. How wickedly hilarious can a movie starring Efron be, considering the fact that there may be market considerations of pleasing his fans?Boy, how wrong we were. The dude who crooned radio friendly hits eight years ago isn't just shirtless (in countless scenes) to show off his bod, he also (warning: parental guidance is advised for the following content) beats people up, takes drugs, speaks dirty and makes plastic dildos moulded from his own manhood. Yup, you read things right – that's the reason why this movie is rated R21 for sexual content, nudity and drug use.We should have known seeing how Stoller's past works include the equally raunchy Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008), Get Him to the Greek (2010) and The Five Year Engagement (2012). The English American filmmaker is also known for his writing credits in comedies like Yes Man (2008), The Muppets (2011) and its recent sequel Muppets Most Wanted. No pretty boy is going to stop him from making a fun comedy which has been absent from the cineplexes for a while.Efron plays the leader of Delta Psi, a fraternity known for their outrageous parties. When a young couple moves in next door, little do they know they are in for a life changing experience. With Seth Rogen on board to come head on with Efron in a battle of, well, many things, you can expect an outrageous barrel of laughs that will keep you adequately entertained throughout the movie's 100 minute duration.The comedian who has made us LOL-ed with his performances in movies like Superbad (2007), Zack and Miri Make a Porno (2008) and Pineapple Express (2008) takes on the role of a man who suddenly realises what ""growing up"" has done to his life, and besides making us laugh, has us thinking about what ""moving on in life"" means. His on screen wife is played by Australian actress Rose Byrne (Insidious, X Men: First Class), who flexes her comedy chops. A gag involving breastfeeding is one unforgettable sequence you won't get out of your head for some time.The cast also includes Dave Franco (21 Jump Street, Now You See Me), Christopher Mintz Plasse (Kick Ass, Pitch Perfect) and MADtv funnyman Ike Barinholtz, all of them leaving us chortling with different gags. As for Efron, let's just say he has left an impression with us with his portrayal of a teenager who's hanging on to his ""best years"" behind (ditch those sappy chick flicks like Charlie St Cloud and The Lucky One, dude). We were actually moved by the themes explored in the movie. When the movie ends with the shirtless Efron and Rogen outside an Abercrombie & Fitch store, we were left pondering where life has taken us. Do we really have to choose between a drool worthy six pack bod and a flabby beer belly?",Neighbors

82,Sergeant_Tibbs,"Very funny, but familiar and too irreverent for its own good.",6,28 August 2014,"It's felt like it's been a while since we had a likable stream of Seth Rogen movies. With This Is The End, Neighbors and the upcoming The Interview, it's quite nice to have his sharp, self- deprecating, sentimental and simple dick joke humour back in the mainstream mix. I always liked him since he burst onto the scene. But Neighbors is a film held up by its ensemble as quite unusually for a film like this they all really put their backs into this rather than lazily reading lines. You can see Rogen, Zac Efron, Dave Franco and Rose Byrne really making an effort for improvised laughs and a spontaneous atmosphere. It's a very funny film and meets This Is The End in that regard, especially with better pacing, but sometimes it's a little too irreverent for its own good.With its freedom of inserting anything for a gag, surreal slapstick and tangent referencing, it feels like a few extended yet throwaway episodes of Family Guy stitched together. It's held back by Stoller's limited vision and stunted production. It's simply too dark all the time and there's no need for hand-held. It's crying for the slick atmosphere of Superbad. They can't help the budget but it feels like they cut corners for a bigger buck looking at those box office receipts. Did they really think it would fail? Nevertheless it's still a good time, although its emotional threads are very familiar and I don't really connect to its 'party is heavenly' mentality, it's certainly a welcome addition to modern R-rated comedies which can be far too mean-spirited than they have to be.6/10",Neighbors
83,Screen_Blitz,Killer funny Seth Rogen comedy,9,22 May 2015,"Seth Rogen was one of the funniest actors in Hollywood, he has been one of my favorite actors since Knocked Up (2007) and Pineapple Express (2008). In this comedy directed by Nicholas Stoller, Seth Rogen plays Mac, an average man with his wife, Kelly (played by Rose Byrne) and an infant daughter, who move to a suburban neighborhood to start new lives. Everything starts off well until Delta Psi Beta, a college fraternity lead by Teddy (played by Zac Efron) moves next door. Mac and Kelly do their best to become friends with them. However, after Mac and Kelly call the cops for a noise disturbance during a wild party, an all-out feud ignites between the two neighbors.Neighbors is a killer funny comedy that had me laughing almost non- stop. Seth Rogen, Rose Byrne, Zac Efron, Dave Franco, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, along with the rest of the cast were quite hilarious. Seth Rogen and Zac Efron showed excellent comedic chemistry with each other. The party scenes in the frat house showed these actors at their finest comedic performances. Like many Seth Rogen comedies, this film has it's raunchy sex humor. If you've seen This Is The End (2013), Superbad (2007) or other Judd Apatow comedies, you will be pretty familiar with the humor. Although it may take it's R-rated humor to the extremes at times, including a scene where the baby is caught with a condom in her mouth (as shown in the trailer), but it is always funny and never tries to be overly gross. This film also does a well job at realistically portraying the experiences of college fraternities, as Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne are constantly competing against the fraternity in a series of ridiculous, crude pranks and antics. Neighbors is a must-watch for Seth Rogen fans, as well as those who enjoy raunchy R-rated comedies.",Neighbors
84,Troy_Campbell,Fails to ignite.,4,11 May 2014,"""Family vs Frat"" reads the tagline for this bawdy motion picture, but it also neatly sums up exactly why this flick fails to ignite. The wittier new-parent humour is aimed at an older audience – a lot of whom have either had children or have family/friends who have had children – whilst the cruder college comedy has a far younger demographic it's targeting, and the two just aren't gelled together successfully enough. Firing off jokes at a mile a minute a few inevitably stick and draw out some chuckles, although it's not until the rambunctious finale, where Zac Efron's party boy and Seth Rogen's peeved neighbour come to blows, that there's a genuine belly laugh to be had. These sort of movies tend not to focus on their storytelling and generally get a free pass for it, but Bad Neighbours is excessively stupid in it's plot contrivances and induces countless eye-rolling moments that are just too dire to go unmentioned. On a positive note, the duelling lead stars are actually really solid, with Efron displaying decent (and previously unseen) comic timing to hold his own against the genre veteran Rogen. Unfortunately, their support is not up to scratch. Aussie Rose Byrne proved with Bridesmaids and I Give It a Year that she has a knack for tickling the funny-bone and Dave Franco's comic turn in 21 Jump Street was impressive, yet they both fall flat here as Rogen's partner in crime and Efron's right hand man respectively. A wild climax exceeds the so-so standard set in the preceding hour, but it doesn't cover up the fact that this is a mildly diverting timewaster that only deserves a viewing when you can pick it up for a few bucks in a DVD bargain bin.",Neighbors

Question was whether the movie will live upto its promise.Hell break loose on a couple with newborn baby after group of care-free young college kids move into their neighbor.From the not-so-great films like Forgetting Sarah Marshall and The Five- year-engagement , Nicholas Stroller strikes a chord with this one. The movie is a thorough entertaining without a single scene to get bored and is filled with some of best comic scenes I've seen in recent times. Sex comedies with good storyline definitely sells and Neighbors succeeds in achieving this and wins the heart of audience. I believe a good movie is remembered even after the audience leaves the theater and same is the case with Neighbors. On the flip side, some scenes are little vulgar and weird ( common in Seth Rogen films) and screenplay looses the moment in between but in the climax makes it fun to watch again. Editing is good. Cinematography is decent. Art direction is just about okay. Background score with few chart busting numbers add well to the mood of the film.

I am not a huge Seth Rogen fan, but he can be funny, sometimes. This time he has struck out. Sadly and drudgingly, this story muddles through a dialogue which was so disjointed and choppy, it was impossible to detect any semblance of a punchline. I understand potty-humor is popular with some people...just not with me. Maybe this story might grow on me. I might see the humor in the gross abuses of drugs and alcohol? Nah.

89,phubbs,Bad Neighbours,4,27 August 2014,"The whole nightmare neighbours thing has been done to death, anyone remember the Aykroyd and Belushi movie 'Neighbours' from 1981? There are other examples that vary on the premise but the idea is old hat, this movie uses the old frat house theme against the homely couple which in itself is not entirely original. None the less its an opportunity to see Rogen act like a beer swilling unkempt overweight slob and...oh wait, that's not entirely original either.So the young-ish couple with a baby living in some huge huge detached house in suburbia are horrified when the other huge huge detached house next door gets turned into a frat house. This kind of thing doesn't really happen in the UK, we don't have frat houses and the concept does sound quite ludicrous frankly although I'm sure this situation has been exaggerated. Most folk in the UK don't live in detached mansions either by the way. At first the young couple get on with the party mad...err frat guys/people, but sure enough tensions mount and eventually the situation boils over into a feud.I kinda found this film to be along the same lines as the comedy 'Identity Thief'. Now when I say comedy I use that term loosely as both movies revolve around situations that aren't really funny, this is how I see them as similar. In reality if this happened to you (either movies plot) it would be horrible, a real nightmare, thusly watching this film kinda made me feel uncomfortable, I actually felt tense and nervous because the whole scenario is just nasty. Sure there are amusing moments...kinda, at first everything is sorta OK but you know it won't last of course. It starts with simple noise pollution as the teens party all night long, little jibes here and there, nothing too bad. Then as things start to heat up Rogen's character attacks the frat house causing bad water damage which the lads somehow manage to fix by selling...dildos?! they make about 10K I think it was...wut?! From there on various things happen which just aren't particularly funny, nothing really seriously malicious like horrific serve vandalism but just dangerous pranks like somehow setting up Rogen's car airbags to go off on his work seat. How on earth did they manage to get into his work place and do that? let alone find out where he works. The same could be said for the airbag pranks inside Rogen's house...how? plus would they really make a fully grown male as heavy as Rogen fly in the air like that? it all seems illogical and it looked stupid.I guess the whole thing just feels completely predictable and like something we've seen before many times over the decades, oh wait we have. All the usual drinking pot smoking visual gags, the nerdy older couple trying to be cool and mix in with the younger kids by dressing idiotically and talking like some street wise surfer rap hoodies (am I showing myself up to be out of touch with that comment?). The party montages are the usual epileptic fit inducing variety with hot scantily cad chicks, neon lights, dance floor grinding, insane activities and close ups of Rogen's bare disgusting hairy gut. What's really kinda weird is the young frat guys keep threatening to do things to get back at Rogen and co yet they never really do much accept for the airbag jokes and just being plainly annoying. The film keeps building up the plot as though something epic is gonna happen but nothing really does. Then in the end after the frat house is shut down and you'd think the frat boys (mainly Efron's character) would be really angry and out for revenge, he just makes up with Rogen as if nothing ever happened! I was like...that's it?!"" after all that you just shake and be friends! what was the point of all this again?I like Rogen I really do, he can be a funny guy, a good average Joe type fella in solid everyday bloke type movies, he's relatable. This just feels like a vain ego trip (seeing as he produced it) which just doesn't work and feels totally forced. Trying too hard and coming across as overbearing with the attempted laughs, get a new schtick Rogen.4/10",Neighbors
90,KnightsofNi11,If you like to laugh see this movie,7,22 September 2014,"Prepare to be disgusted, horrified, offended, and wildly entertained by Forgetting Sarah Marshall director Nicholas Stoller's new uproarious comedy, Neighbors, that brings you a solid 90 minutes of non-stop hilarity.Neighbors stars Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne as a couple who just moved into a new home with their infant daughter. Their dreams of a quiet, peaceful suburban life are instantly tattered when the house next door become a frat house run by Zac Efron and Dave Franco, two maniacal party animals who immediately start to tear it up. After some hysterically failed attempts to play it cool, Rogen and Byrne decide enough is enough and the frat takedown schemes begin, resulting in one absurdly grotesque and inappropriate scenario after another that will keep you laughing from start to finish. This is a movie that could have gone either way. Sometimes these big studio comedies can line up a stellar cast and then still fail, but every once in a while a bit of comedy gold is struck. Such was the case with Neighbors. It's cast brings all of the wacky energy with a non-stop cavalcade of jokes that cover all ends of the funny spectrum with fart jokes, poop jokes, boob jokes, pop culture references galore, and slapstick level dick jokes.Neighbors is actually a really well written flick with pure genuine comedy coursing through it's veins., even if it does have some of the transparency almost all studio flicks do these days. It was clear that the whole cast loved the material they were given, and everyone in the film does their best to take it as far as it will go. Seth Rogen is hilarious as always even if he is playing the same character he always plays. Rose Byrne is somebody I had only ever seen in serious roles, but it turns out she is extremely funny. Her and Rogen play off each other beautifully and the two create one of two superb dynamic duos in this film.The other of course being Zac Efron and Dave Franco as the fraternity brothers who are on a mission to party as hard and as loud as possible to appease the great ancestors of Delta Psi. Coming from his rom-com pretty boy background I never thought much of Efron and his chiseled douchebaggery. Turns out he's also incredibly funny and his bromance with Dave Franco is simultaneously adorable and hilarious. Franco is also great, and his contrast from Efron's character actually adds some depth to this movie as well! If you like to laugh, and I hope you do, then you'd be doing yourself a big favor by watching Neighbors. This movie isn't funny because of whose in it, who cameos, or because of how many pop culture references there are, although none of that hurts. No. It's just funny, plain and simple. It's solid comedy that pushes the limits, but has a purpose. It's a movie that is constantly trying to one-up itself, but isn't that what frat parties are all about? Neighbors is just one big party, and I love it.",Neighbors
91,RforFilm,"How is it that for Neighbors, Zac Efron has the more interesting character then Seth Rogan?",7,21 May 2014,"One thing that I'm noticing more often now that I'm older is that a lot of teenagers like to keep their distance away from adults, which is a lot easier thanks to online social media trends. At first I thought about blaming newer technology, but then I realized that as teenager, I too wasn't too fond about getting scolded at by adults, informing me that I'm being too loud or distant from them. I think that any adult can agree that they've had some sort of rebellious phase where adults are the enemy. Even though I was on good terms with my parents and teachers, I could think of several people that I felt were ""just being old"" the make my life miserable.High school and young college kids develop this kind of attitude for one reason; fear. They know that their days as a kid are almost over and when they look at the most stern authority figures, they see the people that they don't want to be. Once you pass into adulthood, you are now aware that aging is inevitable and you will grow old one day. So as an adult, it's up to you to make each day extraordinary, allowing for new memories, rather then living with nostalgia. Neighbors is about the fine line from childhood to adulthood.Matt Radner (played by Seth Rogan) and his wife Kelly (played by Rose Byrne) have just gotten settled into a new home along with their newborn girl Stella. They've settled into the idea of suburbia; a picket fence home surrounded by similar houses, a nine to five job for Matt, and Kelly staying home to care for Stella. It may seem simple, but there's nothing wrong with simple. Their lives couldn't be betteruntil they get new neighborsa fraternity.Delta-Psi moves in next door to Matt (we later find out that they accidentally burned downed their last home on campus) along with their leaders, Teddy Sanders (played by Zac Efron) and Pete Regazolli (played by Dave Franco). At first, Matt and Kelly try to play it cool by telling them to keep the music down and not get too rowdy. But a call to the police from another parties noise level leads to a war between the two man-childs Matt and Teddy. Matt tries to mess with their plumbing, the fraternity does a sale (I won't give it away as the product is too funny) that has everything repaired. Matt and Rose try to stir up a ""bros before hoes"" dispute between Teddy and Pete and that leads to an interesting conversation about leaving college soon.Neighbors is one of these movies where you think one character will be more interesting then the other when it turns out to be the other way around. I like Seth Rogen. I assumed he would be playing a more complex person that would have him figuring out that line between having fun and being responsible. But while it's not a bad performance, it's a typical Seth Rogan performance we've seen him in before; not much difference. The real star here is Zac Efron.That's right; the frat house party animal is a more interesting character then a new father. Zac Efron takes a real turn here, playing both a cocky arrogant college student that just wants to have fun, but also a scared animal that has never planned ahead. With the way its written, it wouldn't surprise me it was purposely written so that the story can sum up the career of Efron, take a jab here and there on his personal life, and give him advice on what to do next.Now as a story, Neighbors is a feud comedy that I know I've seen before. You know where two people are at war with each other for a dumb reason. But there are some differences here. In a 1980's college film, the frat house guys would have been the heroes, so it's a nice change to see them as villains. But their also fun villains to watch, with what kind of party their gonna throw or how their gonna raise money to fix their plumbing. Matt and Rose may be the responsible ones here, but their not total kill joys. They too get some good lines and even have some fun at the parties. What I do have trouble with are some of the side characters. I hardly remember them and most of them come off as too mean spirited. Plus theirs a fight between Matt and Rose that could have been cut as it goes nowhere. There's nothing wring with having an eighty minute comedy.I'll give this seven Delta-Psi letters out of ten. It's a fun movie to watch, though I could have been a greater story had they give Rogan more to do with his character rather then have him play himself. I know the guy can act. Neighbors will make for plenty of late night screenings in both frat houses and living rooms.",Neighbors

Its their 'war' with a bunch of ""frat"" student neighbors which is the main story.But of course in keeping with the type of movie this is, the film makers want to glamorise the likes of drug taking and drunkenness et al.This film sums up much of what is wrong with America.No wonder the USA is in such a mess.1/10.",Neighbors

And yes, although James Franco is not in this, his cute younger brother with the annoying voice takes over...I was bought this for Xmas and my husband wanted to watch it, even though he hates Rogen, but more than likely because a roids built Zac Efron (complete with matchstick legs as most men in the US don't know about leg workouts) was topless for most of the movie.Yes we giggled ever so slightly in a few scenes, most of which are contained in the trailer, but within ten minutes the drugs were introduced and the bottom of the barrel vile had already been kicked off!I long miss the classic humour of Mel Brooks, Gene Wilder, Steve Martin etc who's movies all stood miles taller than the crap Rogen and team are forever giving us. They didn't need to rely on gross drug comedy to get a laugh because they knew how comedy worked. Something most of today's stars and directors in Hollywood don't have a clue how to do.Bad Neighbors sucks.

97,Christian_Dimartino,"Funny most of the time, but the marketing kind of spoiled some of the fun.",8,15 May 2014,"I saw Nicholas Stroller's Neighbors almost a week ago,I just held off on writing a review... until now. Until Godzilla, which comes out tomorrow, there have only really been two big releases of the summer: this one, and The Amazing Spider-Man 2. I have seen both, and I can't believe I'm saying this, but Neighbors is the best movie of the summer so far.Neighbors is a movie that lives up to its promises, which TASM2 kind of did but not completely. It has just the right amount of stupidity to make it work. Most of the time. The movie did make a few stumbles, but hey, it managed to prove that Zac Efron was talented, so I'll give it credit for that at least.Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne play happily married parents named Mac and Kelly (yeah right, like she'd marry HIM)who move next door to a frat house. The fraternity is led by Teddy (Efron), who Mac claims ""looks like something a gay guy created in a lab. In an attempt to be cool again,Mac and Kelly become friends with the fraternity... and party with them.But soon, the partying and the volume next door becomes a problem for them. So when they call the police, lets just say, the fraternity doesn't take it well. Soon, the frat house starts tormenting them with pranks and before you know it, there is an all out prank war between the two houses.Neighbors mostly succeeds from its dialogue. There are a few of the gags that are funny, and them some of them miss the mark. Also, the trailer kind of takes away the surprises from the movie. Sure, there are still plenty of other laughs to enjoy. But scenes like the ones with the airbags lost their touch once I got to the actual movie, because I saw it so many times in the trailer. Overall, I've seen funnier movies, and then I've seen unfunnier movies. The cast, especially Efron, who nails the frat leader role, and Byrne, who is one of the hottest chicks in the business, executes their lines perfectly. Also, Dave Franco does a fantastic Robert De Niro impersonation. I hope I have sold you, it is pretty good. So for what it's worth, see it. B+",Neighbors
98,MattyGibbs,Poor comedy,3,21 February 2015,A couple with a young baby are tormented by a group of students who move into the house next door. Despite a promising premise and a good first 15 minutes this quickly degenerates into a lame lowbrow comedy with absolutely no class. I'm not a massive Seth Rogen fan as he just plays the same character in every film. His wife is played by Rose Byrne who brings nothing to the table apart from the ability to be irritating. Strangely enough the acting honours are taken by Zak Effron which I think says it all about this film. The toilet humour wears thin quickly and has been done better in many films before it. The film meanders aimlessly from one unfunny situation to another aided only by more witless moronic dialogue. The only thing I'll remember this for is the young baby (probably the cutest baby yet committed to celluloid) who also happens to raise the only laughs in the film. Unless you are a massive Seth Rogen fan there is little to recommend this very poor comedy and it must be watched with the lowest possible expectations.,Neighbors

As far as I can tell, fewer than 10 of them rate this film at 7 stars or above, yet its average rating is slightly more than 7 stars. In fact, while the vast majority of reviews on the first five pages give it only 1 star, the ratings summary says that only 1.2% of those rating it gave it just 1 star.This is a long way of saying that it's now inescapable fact that trolls, spoofers, and studio shills dominate the site. A system is only useful until enough people figure out how to game it, and this is (sadly) now the case for this site.On to the review: Neighbors had a big challenge to overcome with me, as I just don't normally find Seth R. and his ""Seth Pack"" to be very funny. Unfortunately, this film fails on every level to provide either humor or entertainment. It's a rare film that can depict all characters as totally unsympathetic and get away with it. After all, the viewer needs to be able to identify with SOMEONE in a story or film, even if it's the third-party narrator. This movie has absolutely no sympathetic characters in it at all. It's the essence of comedic nihilism. I didn't like any of the characters, none of them said anything that was vaguely funny, and I didn't identify with any point of view expressed in the film. To make matters worse, the director relied solely on profanity and T&A for shock value.Totally worthless movie. Don't waste your time.",Neighbors
100,Laakbaar,The Seth Rogen show,7,18 May 2014,"Seth Rogen did not direct or write this movie, but it feels very much like a Seth Rogen movie. He essentially plays himself in it. I like his humour: it's deadpan, rapid fire, unpredictable, outrageous, off-the-wall, observational and self-effacing. Sometimes he gets hysterical. This humour suffuses the film. It's a style shared with Jonah Hill and Jay Baruchel. As usual, the main themes are sex, drugs and partying. If boner jokes are not your thing, don't go to this movie.The other actors seem to be there to keep up with Rogen. Rose Byrne and Ike Barinholtz pulled this off quite well. Zac Ephron was hot and did OK, despite being comedically out of his league. Lisa Kudrow was hilarious.The frat house scenes in the film seemed unrealistic and over the top to me, although I suppose the point of these scenes was to fuel teenage fantasies and indulge the narcissism and sense of entitlement of the internet generation. No college frat house is like this. It was too sexual, too druggy, too extreme. I kept thinking how much I had preferred the simple and more believable hijinks of ""Animal House"" when it came out.Still it's not that bad a film, even though I didn't enjoy it as much as ""This is the End"".

102,TheSquiss,Over-egged & devoid of genuine humour.,2,28 May 2014,"It's taken me almost a fortnight to get around to writing this review. That tells you pretty much everything about Bad Neighbours (or Neighbors if you're in the USA).The 'selling point' that it's a brash comedy ""From the guys who brought you This is the End"" was enough to put me off from the outset. Then I saw the trailer, laughed out loud and chided myself for judging Bad Neighbours prematurely.The trouble is, both funny moments are in the trailer and they're just not funny second time around.I'm well aware that Bad Neighbours' target demographic is late teens to late twenties and I was fortunate to find the perfect audience to watch Mac (Seth Rogan) and Kelly (Rose Byrne) romp about with hilarity in their neighbourhood warfare with Teddy (Zac Effron) and his fraternity when they move in next door. However, guess how many laughs I heard from the audience? I could hold up five fingers and have a handful of change.It stinks. It is severely over-egged, lacks restraint, completely misses the delicate art of comedy and eschews the rule 'leave them wanting more.' Bad Neighbours doesn't know when to stop and probably shouldn't have started in the first place.There are some comedic gems that are visually set up and then pummeled until absolutely every dim-witted drunk in the audience 'gets' it. Sex with topiary? Yep, we'll keep on humping that sculpted bush until subtlety becomes a distant dream.Bad Neighbours is (yet again) another great idea for a work of comedic art that is hammered rather than sculpted. Director Nicholas Stoller (The Five-Year Engagement) has forgotten to rein in his actors and attempted to wring a laugh out of every single syll-a-ble rather than stepping back and looking at the effect of the broad canvas.The result is a labored, embarrassing mess.

Sure, I laughed at the trailer and that could either mean I would laugh at some additional scenes that were contained in the film or I would just chuckle lighter at the ones I already haw-haw'ed at. So, yes, I knew I was going to have a hearty hardy har har at the film but I wasn't prepared for how funny I was actually going to find it. Spoiler alert: I found it extremely hysterical! I know some people hate how vulgar comedies are and pine for the days when a pie to the face was enough to make someone wet themselves but I'm one of those degenerates who revels in the swear-encrusted, insult-based, raunchy, debaucheries of comedic adventures that guys like Seth Rogen are synonymous with—that isn't to say that pies in the face aren't good either. That being said, ""Neighbors"" isn't trying to do anything new in the world of comedies that contain sex gags, genital references, F-bombs, and the occasion moment of bodily harm; however, the film is still utilizing a great formula of a prank war between two factions that are wonderfully written and so excellently performed that I found myself cheering on both sides because their beef resulted with laughs on my end.One thing, above all else, that stood out to me was how great the cast was in their roles. Sure, Seth Rogen was a sure thing because this is his type of comedy and Dave Franco is getting funnier and funnier with every comedy he does but I wasn't ready for how great Rose Byrne and Zac Efron was. While Byrne was great as the straight lady in ""Bridesmaids,"" I was super impressed with how well she held her own in scenes with more established comedic stars and, occasionally, outdid the likes of Seth Rogen. Efron, on the other hand, has always been an actor I just don't bother acknowledging because he was a Disney product that was never meant to be sold to me and, admittedly, I thought his presence in this film was the usual tween star doing the R-rated film in order to breakout of their wholesome previous work. I was wrong. Efron was excellent in the film and made it look like he's never been in anything like ""High School Musical"" and has spent his entire career in comedies and movies like ""Neighbors."" I thought it was going to be okay and mildly amusing but ""Neighbors"" proved to be a lot funnier than I was ready for. The story is simple enough and fertile enough for comedic happens and the cast is great and all really proved to be perfect for their roles. The end product was a film filled with hilarity and fun. ""Neighbors"" will definitely be one of those comedies I will watch many more times down the road.Salutations! My name is Rev.

104,bbickley13-921-58664,Hilarious!!,8,11 May 2014,"Look at Zac Efron trying to be more than just a pretty face, though its' obvious that's the main reason they hired him. I remember seeing him in the Paperboy a few years back and even though he was decent in the serious drama, he lucked out in getting the role cause he looks good in nothing but his underwear.He was funnier in That Awkward Moment, which he had a hand in getting made, but that makes sense cause this movie is all about Rogen and his skills at writing jokes. His observations on life which always feel like improv are all over this Frat boy comedy. It's an interesting combination of the Frat movie and the Family comedy. A group of rowdy Frat boys led by Efron and co-lead by Seth's boy toy, James Franco's little brother Dave, as the smart conscious of the group, move into a residential neighborhood. Everything you would expect from a Frat movie, from wild parties to toilet humor, is all over this flick. Everything except the large amount of naked girls that I would have expected from a Frat film.Maybe that has to do with the family part, as Seth and Rose Byrne play a couple whose lives changed drastically now that a baby is in the picture. Though you herd the jokes over and over again about how the baby takes too much of your time, and you use to be the life of the party and how you envy your friends cause they can drop everything to do whatever they want, but we have not herd pot enthusiast, Seth Rogen tell this joke and that's what makes it refreshing.These two stories intertwine when the Frat house moves in next store to the family, who attempt off the bat to seem cool while telling the Frat to keep quiet. They almost pull it off, but it does not take long to show how much a baby can age you and how immature a 21 year old frat boy can be. Zac Efron's villainy is fun to watch. I noticed he plays ass hole very well. Christopher Mintz-Plasse from Kick Ass has a small role in the movie as a Frat boy which I honestly feel should have been bigger, as I think he adds some star power to the flick. Ike Barinholtz who I remember from Mad TV was hilarious as Seth's single and dull minded friend. The only real Tragedy in casting was Hannibal Buress, who plays a patrol officer. This Guy is too funny, but the movie does not use it.Overall a great energetic R rated movie. Any Seth Rogen driven comedy is a blockbuster worth seeing.",Neighbors

All is going well until they find out the new neighbours turn the house into a fraternity house. Now they must find a way to get the peaceful life they always wanted.The idea of the film is quite good. It is a very amusing film, it's just not very laugh out loud funny. I did laugh a few times, but it was only at the scenes that were already shown in the trailer. I liked some of the fights they had. The neighbours really went to war and it made for a good movie. I loved the way they always tried to outdo each other.I felt like the baby in the movie was not really needed. The parents in this film were terrible parents. They swore in front of the child, smoked weed and at some points I am pretty sure they left the kid at home alone. I just think it would have been better without the child because the couple who had the kid were not really likable. I always thought that in films the good guys were supposed to be liked, but I didn't really like them. I also didn't like the new fraternity neighbours. So, it just made me not really care who won the battle. It was just fin to see them fighting all the time.The acting was really good from everyone. Even though I didn't like the characters, the actors did a good job at what they were doing. The film stars Seth Rogen﻿, Rose Byrne and Zac Efron﻿. Seth is a good actor and so is Rose. I have always liked most of their work and I think they do a good job in this. Now... Zac Efron has had a lot of work to do. I hated High School Musical and thought he couldn't act to save his life, but I have to say he was actually very convincing in this. I hated him... but that is exactly how he played it. At first you liked his character and thought he was an understanding nice kid, but then the war begins and you really see what his character is like. Zac did a great job and I think he would get far in Hollywood as long as he chooses the right roles.This film was fun to watch and it is very entertaining, i just felt a sense of disappointment after watching it. I was really hoping it to be more funny.

Not seeming to be stuffy fogies, this couple tries to first be cool about keeping the fraternity mayhem to a minimum by trying to join them, then compete with them, and then go at war with them. This movie is a bunch of bits put together.

108,ArchonCinemaReviews,Gratuitous vulgarity can make you laugh,6,28 August 2014,"Do you complain about morals? Then Neighbors might not be the movie for you.If you like profanity, crude sexual humor and typically view yourself as immoral and love vulgarity, then stick around because Neighbors (aka Bad Neighbors) might be for you! Kelly and Mac Radner are adults and they can prove it: they are married, bought the house and recently had a child. A fraternity buys the house next door and the Radners are conflicted. While they want to secure their quaint suburban family life they also may not be ready to give up their youth just yet. They betray the frat while trying to strike a harmonious balance while still being 'cool' and retaliation ensues.This movie is far more 'indecent' than the trailer led potential viewers to believe. The Radners, played Rose Byrne and Seth Rogen, are not mature adults in conflict with college kids. They are stir crazy twenty-somethings coming to terms with their inevitable adulthood. The humor is also far more vulgar and blatantly sexual and drug related.That being said, if you like that kind of thing then you will enjoy this movie. Somehow Neighbors manages to take crude humor to the next level, surpassing innuendos. To say there are drugs and sex in this movie would be an understatement. I'm a fan of ridiculous crude humor that makes people squirm and it was prevalent. A lot of times it seemed like a competition between actors for who could make the other break.The chemistry between the head frat boys, played by Zac Efron and Dave Franco, was excellent. They were the focus of most of my enjoyment from watching the film. Franco and Efron were perfect parodies of the college bromance. Rogen and Byrne do a sufficient job of being lame responsible adults but at times went a bit overboard.This movie was definitely made for a younger crowd and while the plot development was minimal and the film escalates inexplicably quickly it's ridiculous and funny.More reviews at our website.",Neighbors

Wow. This is a perfectly cast comedy with countless truly hilarious moments. Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne (of Damaged fame) are perfect as the couple who are trying to raise an infant in a house next door to the newest fraternity of all night long partiers. What's so funny is as wild as this film gets, it all remains plausible; nothing goes past what could possibly actually happen in such a situation. I'm serious--this film made me laugh out loud constantly throughout. It earns its place among such classic comedies as Slap Stick, King Pin or Pineapple Express. And it has heart.

110,Cinemaniac1984,Watching this overrated comedy was a very underwhelming experience,2,24 January 2015,"I know it is called Neighbors in North America, but for the purposes of this review I will continue to refer to this movie as Bad Neighbours as this is the title in Australia. The trailer and the many good reviews for Bad Neighbours looked very promising for this to be a funny and enjoyable movie. Upon watching this movie in the cinema, I was dismayed at how overrated and mostly unfunny the final product was. It was as if the trailer used all the funny moments and used them all up. There was very brief moments of humour, but I could count on one hand the amount of times I had a brief laugh. To be honest, the movie tried too hard to be funny. I walked out of the cinema very disappointed.Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne play Mac Radner and Kelly Radner, a couple with a newborn baby who are settling down and have become content with parenthood until a university fraternity with a reputation for wild parties have moved next door. At first the relationship between the neighbours is amiable , particularly with the fraternity leader Teddy Sanders (Zac Efron, who has buried his pretty boy Disney image) until after a particularly noisy party Mac and Kelly are forced to call the police to ask the neighbours to turn the noise down. When the police identify Mac and Kelly as the culprits who have called the police, Teddy and the rest of the fraternity declare war on the neighbours, which results in a series of pranks and acts of sabotage between the two neighbours.Crude and sexual humour is often hit and miss, and Bad Neighbours often overplays that card to a point where it grows very tiresome and unfunny.Seth Rogen is unconvincing as the new father as he still behaves like a man who refuses to grow up and still act like a teenager. I liked Seth Rogen in Knocked Up, Pineapple Express, and Observe and Report, however his humour can be very hit and miss at times. This movie is not one of memorable movies. I found Rose Byrne to be seriously miscast as she seems to be more at home in dramas and thrillers. While it was good to see Zac Efron move on from his days of being typecast in such movies as High School Musical, I wasn't a big fan of him in this movie.I'm sure there were a lot of people that liked Bad Neighbours and found it funny, however I am not one of those people that found it funny.

No one older than a four year old (or someone profoundly retarded) would mistake this swill for humor.I didn't expect much, of course. Who would? But I at least thought there would be a coherent storyline or plot structure. Not that it's needed if you have a bunch of ace improv'ers. But Rogan has never been in that league. He can be amusing on occasion but he tends to rise or fall with the quality of the film, director, and other actors he's sharing screen time with. Many times he's just the weakest link. There are points in ""Neighbors"" when the flat chemistry between Rogan and Byrne threatens to deafen you even more than the soundtrack (which is actually quite good). Neither seems to know what to say next but, really, what *does* one say after you're forced to spray breast milk into the face of your co-thespian? The desperation here is excruciatingly palpable.And how about those mostly stellar mainstream media reviews? The Rotten Tomato average is 73% with many huge outlets loving this piece of crap.

The film has a smart and engaging premise, a very talented and charismatic cast, really solid direction, a well written screenplay and even manages to pull out a couple of surprises here and there, but obviously, most importantly of all, it does deliver the laughs and many of them. The humor keeps coming and even though it is a bit uneven in the sense that in some parts your laughing very hard in others your simply smiling, you never get the sense that laughs are being thrown at you for the sake of it and this makes up for a perfectly flowing and entertaining movie. The jokes that made me nearly roll on the floor where the pop-culture references, there are many and they all hit a home run in laughs, especially Dave Franco's impersonation of Robert De Niro and Zac Efron's gag on the ""you talking to me?"" from Taxi Driver, those two really had me gasping for breath. The other very, very remarkable element of the movie are the party scenes; they are very well put together and effortlessly entertaining, in particular the dance competition between the two leads was another thing that had me laughing my ass off. But amongst all the laughter the movie does have heart and wants to say something of its own. It does have pacing problems in the first act, a couple of secondary characters don't seem to fit in the story fluently and sometimes feel unbelievable and the emotional component of the movie isn't as resonant as it should be. Anyways this was a very funny comedy that definitely delivered what it was aiming for.",Neighbors
117,shawneofthedead,"Much funnier than you'd expect, with a standout turn from Byrne. But great it ain't.",5,1 July 2014,"Was anybody really expecting anything great from Bad Neighbours? Its trailer limped into cinemas, packing what you'd suspect are its funniest gags (an air cushion lurking dangerously in an office chair) and not a lot of laughs. And yet, this lowbrow comedy with a bit of a heart won plenty of plaudits in America - perhaps because of how it was, surprisingly, quite funny after all. That much is true: the film will make you laugh quite a bit, frequently with the sheer audacity of its raunchy humour. But it's still too scattershot an effort to really succeed as a coherent film.Great comedy is built on friction, tension and fundamental differences. What could be more different than Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly (Rose Byrne), a young couple with a newborn baby, and the raucous frat boys who move into the house next door? A lot, the film seems to suggest: Mac and Kelly have grown-up responsibilities that college boy Teddy (Zac Efron) and his best buddies don't. And so, when Mac and Kelly call the cops on a party getting out of control, a war of increasingly outlandish (and downright dangerous) pranks breaks out between the two sides.There is, actually, quite a lot that does work pretty well in Bad Neighbours. Mac and Kelly are given an unexpected amount of depth, both as individuals torn between their youth and their new child, and as a couple. Teddy, too, comes across as a bit of a lost boy: a Peter Pan who can't see beyond the lazy hazy days of college, even as his best friend and love-rival Pete (Dave Franco) starts exploring the world beyond. Spice it all up with a clutch of really funny gags, and much of the film goes down surprisingly easily.But the film also meanders in search of its comedic soul, often feeling like a series of hopefully funny set-pieces strung together with little care for depth and nuance. You'll be bombarded with humour so bawdy it's downright offensive - and not necessarily in a good way - like Kelly's painful brush with alcohol-laced breast milk. It often feels as if the film is operating without a script, the actors improvising their way through a bunch of scenes while director Nicholas Stoller leaves his camera rolling. The battle between young couple and frat boys also becomes ridiculously protracted and quite unbelievable by the end.At least Stoller's cast is immensely fun to watch. Rogen plays his standard everyday-schlub role very well, and Efron continues to prove that there's hope for him yet beyond High School Musical. But the real breakout star here is Byrne: more the straight (wo)man in Bridesmaids, she lets loose here and proves herself to be a wonderfully adept and very brave comedienne. She soldiers through scenes that can't have been easy to shoot, and does so with such grace and charm that you can practically see where they'd have gone (further) wrong without her.If you're looking for a lowbrow comedy with a reasonably good hit rate where gags are concerned, Bad Neighbours might hit the spot - it's even got a set of characters who are pretty fun to be around, though the outrageous situations in which they keep getting themselves might turn you off. But just because this amiable, dumb and admittedly fun film turned out better than you might expect doesn't mean it's actually good.",Neighbors

119,gavinp9,Very fun Seth Rogen comedy,8,2 January 2018,"'Bad Neighbours' is a really enjoyable and well-made comedy. Plenty of laughs throughout, with a great cast and decent ending. Rogen plays his usual loveable buffoon and Byrne is surprisingly good as his wife, as she's allowed to keep her Aussie accent, rather than doing a fake American one. But the way they act together, with their cute baby, is quite realistic and charming. The whole plot is really simple - a frat moves in, they don't like it, so a battle to get rid of them escalates.There's an excellent support cast - Hannibal Buress as the cop (particularly the Garfield bit), Lisa Kudrow as the Dean & Jason Mantzoukas as the doctor all have some great lines. There's some drawn-out fraternity/party scenes, but overall it's well-paced, with constant jokes and funny moments throughout. Even the baby gets a few laughs, particularly during the calendar shoot!Efron & (the younger) Franco do a good job as the frat-boys, but it's pretty predictable - except for some of the pranks (& fights) they pull, which have heaps of laughs. It's probably not as good as 'Old School', but still better than some of Rogen's recent comedies.",Neighbors

This is a lazy piece of hack filmmaking that relies heavily on improv to stretch this paper thin premise to unbearable feature length. Rose Byrne and Seth Rogan never feel believable as a couple and they just feel like two actors riffing off each other. It's painful to watch these two talented people drown in this lame material, trying to out wit a script and premise that always works against them. Every damn scene in this laugh free bore is structured like a network television situation comedy with profanity - frat moves in next door, so we get endless riffing from Rogan and Byrne about how to approach them and still be cool. Crap like this goes on and on - and on, ad nauseam. Rogan has saved scenes from his previous films with his quick wit and bouncing improv off other talented actors who can run with it - here, Byrne can't keep up and while her energy level always seems amped (just like a real mother with a new born) it's not in her skill set to improv anything that's not scripted on the page. Neighbors just feels dead on the screen.",Neighbors

An interesting vehicle for Zac Efron, he had started working on more serious films but seems to have taken a huge leap back in this zany comedy. Nevertheless he played his part brilliantly. Zac stars as the president of a Fraternity who move into a nice neighbourhood next door to new parents Seth Rogan and Rose Byrne. Deciding to start on the offensive the young couple go to the Frat House with their baby to try to set some ground rules, however when the couple call the police to complain about the noise an all out war begins. If you are expecting a nice tasteful comedy then this film is not for you, it is definitely an American Pie style comedy, lude and crude and judging by most people in the cinema, quite entertaining.

This movie is the same. Some times over the top gags are still pretty funny. If you've seen any of Seth's movies this one is no different. The main plot for Neighbors is a couple has a new baby and a Frat house moves next door. They call the cops on a noise complaint and all out war starts. Seth is as funny as ever and Zac Efron really shines in his role as the Frat leader. He's absolutely perfect. The only cast member I didn't like was Rose Bryne. She plays Seth Rogans wife and she's not that great. But the film as a whole is very well cast and super funny. This comedy though is not Seths strongest. It doesn't reach the hilarity of This Is The End or Pineapple Express. That said, It did have a lot to live up to but just couldn't quite make it as a stand out comedy flick. The gags that start to go down as the film progresses are really quite funny. And some of the on going jokes between Zac and Seths characters are awesome. But the jokes don't fly at a million miles an hour like they usually do. But when they do come they're laugh out loud funny. All in all Neighbors is a solid comedy with a likable cast, Great on going jokes, and a stand out Zac Efron.

Others however, just write jokes and connect them with a thin storyline.Rogen displays a rare talent to make people laugh again and again. Not with making faces, but with original and clever jokes. But after a dozen movies, the jokes get less original. With 50/50, Rogen proved to be a good actor. With The Green Hornet, Rogen proved to yell a lot and be a horrible, annoying who hijacked the screen from decent co-actors.Thruth be told: I laughed a lot during Bad Neighbours. There are enough funny moments which you want to remember and tell your friends. For example the boobs that need to be milked. Props to Rose Byrne who can hold her own in comedy, while displaying some good acting. She's more than a pretty face.But the majority is made (or ruined) by Rogen, who repeats the formula, with a lot of yelling, yelling and more yelling.

You should not be required to throw reality out the window in order to enjoy it. Seth Rogen's typical charm is non-existent in this film and when Dave Franco gives maybe the movie's best performance, you've got to question what you could've been doing during those 90 minutes that wouldn't have been as painful. Bamboo shoots underneath finger nails comes to mind.That being said, there were two redeemable elements to the movie. The first is that Rose Byrne is absolutely gorgeous. She is stunning and should be in more movies than she is. The second is that the fight scene in the end with Rogen and Zac Efron is hilarious.

In the other hand you could think it was extremely entertaining and funny. There are some very funny jokes and likable absurdities during the competition between the two houses, they are pranking each other back and forth, which is fun to watch. I feel like there are a great chemistry between the stars; not only between Rose Byrne and Seth Rogen who are fantastic together, but also between Efron and Rogen. They are really good. Indeed, both of them are in the same path but in different ways. They are experiencing the same things. There is a gap between them as one is going from teenage hood to adulthood as he experiments the fact of being a dad and the other has to face the harsh reality leaving college and working world.

129,Semisonic,Vulgar yet true tale about ageing and family life that some prudes can't handle,7,27 August 2014,"Seriously people, all these 1/10 reviews - what were you thinking? That you'll be some second Mother Teresa for down-voting something you consider immoral and crude?Ever since Shrek we know that all the substantial things tend to have layers, and even Transformers claim to have more than meets the eye. Sorry for those clichés, but i can't help thinking that all those people who bashed this movie outright just never made it past the ""raving frat boys vs the not really smart couple who recently became parents"". And obviously those people got very grossed out with what they saw here.Yes, this might not be a Casablanca or Shawshank Redemption of 2014, but rating it so low is just hypocritical. Honestly, this movie's miles better than some lazy Adam Sandler or Eddie Murphy production they've been doing recently. I admit, this movie is crude and vulgar, with lots of penis jokes and stuff like that, but it's the best indicator whether you're a prude or not. Because some people tend to think that their life is so pure and they are all perfect, while it's not true and they have the same vices or weaknesses that everyone else does - they just hide them in their closets and pretend they don't exist. And when they see their own weaknesses in someone else who's not afraid to admit them - it hurts so much in their butts that they can't keep the hate at bay.Guys, this is a typical Seth Rogen movie: it is gross sometimes, but it's as true as truth comes. Some scenes in it may feel awkward for you, especially if you're some 30-40 year old person at the early stages of a family life. But that's only because you can't help recognizing the familiarity. The characters in the movie are so believable that sometimes it's like laughing at yourself - which isn't always an easy task.Yet the movie's more than just the overall silliness - even though the silliness alone is so hilarious here the movie would've done great even without any deeper levels. Yet they present themselves in a form of an eternal antagonism of desperately trying to be forever young and actually accepting your maturing as a part of the whole game and learning to enjoy it. The way this antagonism is played on the both ""younger"" and ""older"" sides is amazing, which adds some drama level to the genre you don't really expect any seriousness from.For being frank with the audience yet not using it as a reason to play dumb all the time, this movie deserves all the praise a comedy with fart jokes and prosthetic penises may ever receive. Just give it a shot, and try not to be overly serious or morally judging - and you'll definitely get your satisfaction.",Neighbors

The movie weighs itself in the basis of Family vs Frat, as Rogen's character Mac Redner, married to Byrne's Kelly Redner and with a baby to raise, go head-to-head with a fraternity that moves next to them in the neighborhood. This frat is spear headed by president Teddy (Efron) and VP Pete (Franco). The comedy's objective was to fully gross you out and get those awkward laughs from the audience. Whether this is to your liking, or not, will determine your enjoyment of it. I personally love these types of movies and their sheer ridiculousness. As for this one, great comedic performances always help, and all members of the cast do what they do best to entertain and make us laugh.

He has now turned that trifecta into a quadrifecta with his newest comedy Neighbors.Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly Radner (Rose Byrne) are a married couple with a new home and an infant daughter. Their lives revolve around caring for their kid. One day, they noticed that a college fraternity has moved in next door to them. Realizing what the fraternity will be doing, Mac and Kelly go over to introduce themselves and nicely ask fraternity president Teddy (Zac Efron) and vice president Pete (Dave Franco) to keep the volume down. The fraternity doesn't listen, so Mac and Kelly go over and party with them and form a friendship. However, Mac breaks their trust by calling the cops, and all hell breaks loose between the Radners and the fraternity guys. The only one who is not willing the tolerate the nonsense is the college's Dean (Lisa Kudrow).Nicholas Stoller has done another awesome job as a director, with this story of older couple vs. college fraternity. Stoller continues to show his talents behind the camera with making the film feel like a breeze, getting good performances out of his actors, and continuing to go for the laughs at just the right time.Seth Rogen still shows some of the same stuff he's done in past performances, but this time he shows us a guy who is more grown up and mature compared to past characters like Ben Stone or Zack Brown. Rose Byrne is hilarious as the wife who is just as much clever as she is attractive. Byrne gives another one of her best performances. Efron shows that he wants to shed his younger image and gives us a interesting role as a guy who will stop at nothing until he proves his dominance over the Radners. Dave Franco is also interesting as a smart guy who puts his wants in life over his fraternity. The surprise to me is Ike Barinholtz as Mac's best friend Jimmy, a divorcée who wants nothing to do with his friend's plans until he realizes a frat guy named Scoonie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) is having sex with the ex-wife Paula (Carla Gallo).",Neighbors

With talented and popular comedic actors like Seth Rogan, Zac Efron, Rose Byrne, and Dave Franco, it could have been a raunchy but likable comedy. No such luck. The fault lies not with the lead actors, who do what they can, but with the screenplay. In fact, if it weren't for the leads, this film would deserve a negative rating. The film's ideas of humor are just disgusting. I don't mean that it's dirty or raunchy in a funny way, either. Raunchy humor has its place if its done with wit and talent. But not here. There are lines and gags which are so gross, they would embarrass as sex-starved 13 year-old. The condom swallowing scene is among the most offensive of any film this year or even decade. The breast milk clogging scene deserves dishonorable mention, as well. Seth Rogan delivers his lines very well, but he should be banned from ever doing a nude scene. Zac Efron can give a good performance, but here his shirtless torso does most of the acting. Rose Byrne is likable and looks nice topless, but her talent and breasts are wasted in this rotten movie.

134,FilmMuscle,A Neighborhood of Pure Obnoxiousness,5,14 May 2014,"I guess that I'll just have to start getting used to living in an age where incessant simpleminded sex and stoner jokes are funny. This new generation of comedy-viewers has wholly bought into all the trashiness and bawdiness Judd Apatow and Seth Rogen have introduced into the comedic fray, which certainly explains why vacuous titles like Bridesmaids and This is the End are somehow considered ""absolutely hilarious."" Neighbors carries with it a very simple premise that doesn't require three paragraphs of expansion: a couple—with a baby—is forced to deal with a wild fraternity house right next door. In this case, as usual with Rogen films, the humor herein completely relies on crudeness; in fact, I only found myself laughing three or four times throughout the movie. What awaits is a series of very senseless, unbelievable events that serve to conveniently move the plot along. For instance, somehow, the family convinces the frat party into believing that their probation has been lifted without the film ever even putting effort into explaining it. Did they find some way to hack into the university's notification systems or what? On top of that, we're also supposed to believe that this no-good, dimwitted group of college kids knew exactly where Rogen's character worked and knew exactly where he sat in order to place the airbags in the right regions. You can call me a nitpicker all you want, but lots of actions performed throughout are either utterly moronic or downright implausible. Furthermore, that ending really feels shoehorned in and totally forced after an hour and a half of blatant debauchery and repugnance. To be fair, the film paints itself as a fairly douchey comedy, and it comes to no surprise how repulsive a fraternity can be. The bigger surprise is the lows our protagonists—who we're supposed to be rooting for, mind you —stoop down to. They're indulging in the same type of impropriety numerous times throughout only to apparently despise it shortly thereafter. No regular human being would engage in the same activities and methods this couple had just to crumble a fraternity. Again, with the humor, the film never offers anything cleverer than a profusion of tired dick and vagina jokes. Moreover, modern comedies seem to love implementing pop culture references when most of them turn out awkward and go on for far too long. Wow, the hundredth Christian Bale-Batman imitation—so funny! Hmmm, a promising start to a Robert DeNiro imitation sequence only to divert to sheer messiness and prolongation. Now, for what it's worth, the flick is actually largely entertaining regardless. The pacing is solid, and there's never a lame moment, despite their flat jokes. The party scenes are very well shot and edited in all their extravagant vibrancy and radiant inebriation. In addition, Zac Efron definitely delivers, and I've always been a supporter of Efron since he does possess more acting talent than that of a generic pretty boy. The guy can both convincingly portray a likable, sympathetic character like we saw in 17 Again and an utter douchebag and stereotypical frat boy with this one. Rosa Byrne was the other showstopper, effortlessly stealing every single scene she was inwhile Rogen just played his usual vulgar self. All in all, you've probably seen a multitude of raunchy comedies similar to this one—plenty of them starring Seth Rogen, for that matter—and this one is hardly any better, innovative, or memorable. In the meantime, I think I'm done with Rogen's immaturity and mindless sense of humor. Actually, here's a little tidbit: on the set, Rogen laughed until he cried when the baby was eating the condom—enough said",Neighbors

140,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn! review,7,9 May 2014,"I'm not a Seth Rogen fan. The only movie I've seen featuring him was ""This is the end"", and I thought it was boring and unfunny. Moreover, a movie featuring Seth Rogen will most likely prompt me to ignore its existence, instead of making me want to see it (is it because of his face?) – and that's exactly what happened with Bad Neighbours. But, you got to do what you got to do, so I just went in the theater with the lowest possible expectations, and came out pleasantly surprised. I love it when a movie does that. Still, Bad Neighbours isn't great and has flaws I'll be sure to point out soon.Bad Neighbours is about a couple, Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly (Rose Byrne), who have just moved into their new house with their little daughter. They don't want to feel and be seen by friends as old, but at the same time they realise their life has been irreversibly changed by their baby. So when a fraternity, led by Teddy (Zac Efron), moves in the neighbouring house, the couple act friendly and participate to a party, hoping to get the fraternity to keep quiet in the future. When this doesn't happen, the couple and the fraternity declare ""war"" to each other.One of the best qualities of this movie is that it succeeds, more or less, in being a comedy. In this modern world, plagued by Adam Sandler and similar untalented money-making people, comedies are definitely becoming a genre more intelligent people avoid. In Bad Neighbours, however, even some primitive or infantile jokes are able to make most people laugh. Another commendable feature of the movie is its cast: all of the main actors are very good – Rose Byrne really stands out, even compared to Rogen – and those in smaller roles, while not being important (almost) at all, are fine.Now for the negative characteristics. While some jokes work, others are so extreme they just make you uncomfortable, and many scenes make you feel what Germans call ""fremdschämen"" - the embarrassment felt on behalf of someone else. Because of all of this, the movie is often difficult to watch. Also, if you catch yourself trying to uncover the reason or the logic behind some (many) of the actions – like for example, why aren't the other neighbours ever complaining about the noise? – you'll find there is none. This is a frustrating trademark of bad movies that will probably hit you once you exit the theater. But, ultimately, if you're looking for a couple of good laughs in a not very smart comedy, Bad Neighbours is a good choice.Rating: 7/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",Neighbors
141,vistheindian,Not bad at all,7,12 May 2014,"Quickie Review:Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly (Rose Byrne) just had a baby girl, and are settling down in a nice, quiet neighborhood. This all changes when a loud partying fraternity, led by Teddy (Zac Efron) moves in next door. And so a stream of funny schemes ensue as they try to make each other move out of the neighborhood. This movie could have easily gone down the route of typical frat comedies, but surprisingly there is more heart to it than one might expect. This may not be the funniest movie ever made, but you will definitely leave the cinema with some memorable moments and an overall enjoyable time.Full Review:Honestly when I first saw the trailers, I had quite low expectations. I thought this might be just another frat comedy with a collection of mediocre gags. However, the main cast really did make this movie funnier than I expected it to be. By now most people are familiar with Seth Rogen. He is a one-trick pony, so don't be surprised to see him be the same dopey man-child that he usually plays. Still, that is not a bad trick, and it ends up working very well for the comedic times. However, the real surprise performances were of Zac Efron and Rose Byrne. Efron actually brought some depth to this seemingly stereotypical frat boy. There are moments where you actually see the non-douchie side to him and sympathize with him. As for Rose Byrne, she really does take charge in this movie, and is pivotal in some of the funniest schemes they pull off. I am not a woman, but I'd assume this is the type of strong comedic actresses that women actually want to see, unlike some recent crap-fest ""comedy"" releases, **cough** The Other Woman **cough**. Keeping up with the comedic timing of Seth Rogen is no easy achievement, but both Efron and Byrne pull it off to great effect.Comedy is the most subjective of all genres out there. What might make me laugh may not necessarily make you laugh. This movie will not make you laugh every minute, and some jokes don't always hit the mark as hard as the writers thought it would. However, the chemistry between the characters is great and their awkward, scheming ways is a joy to watch. There are also some moments that are so memorable, that you are bound to recall it and laugh again with your friends. Overall I had a fun time watching it, and I am sure you will not leave the cinema disappointed.P.S. this movie possibly has the cutest baby in movie history.",Neighbors
142,jbacks3,I have to admit there were laughs...,6,10 May 2014,"I've always regarded Seth Rogen as a potheaded version of Adam Sandler. In a perfect world, both of these guys wouldn't find work in Hollywood beyond bagging groceries at Ralph's on Van Nuys Blvd. Sandler is responsible for drek like Little Nicky and Jack & Jill, whereas Rogen should be held criminally responsible for The Green Hornet. And it was only out of equal parts boredom and trepidation that I saw Neighbors today. It's crude, predictable and takes wild stabs at shock value for laughs. Some of them work (I'm a tough crowd and there were 3 laugh out loud gags)... but whether you like Neighbors or not will depend on your tolerance for dick jokes, recreational drug use and lactation. This is not a kid's movie. Neighbors looks like Citizen Kane compared to The Green Hornet. I'll be generous and call this a 6, only because it exceeded my low expectations.",Neighbors
143,Dannyboi94,One of the greatest comedies of all time,9,20 May 2016,"Bad Neighbours is a fantastic comedy, and one of the rarer ones at that. Most comedies that have been realised over the past few years have been OK at best, but this one was different. Throughout the entire movie you are filled with laughter and joy, there is not one dull moment.While this film will not be the next classical comedy, as it does not have the greatest story in the world, but it has some of the best characters in comedy. Their chemistry is fantastic, and Seth and Rose are a very believable couple with great acting. The writing is also very good, and it does not seem forced, but the best aspect of this movie is, Zac Efron. Usually when he is in a movie, you would expect some ridiculous teen romance, but here he shines. His comedic performance is fantastic, and some of the best scenes are with him in it.I have seen that this film has not had a lot of love on this site, with a 6.4 rating, but it deserves a much higher one. It is a blast, and a great comedy to enjoy while chilling.I would give this movie a 8.6/10 one of the funniest movies of the 2010s.",Neighbors
144,eryui,It just hurt,1,5 February 2016,"I have to review this, because the current rating and the title have misled me. After twenty minutes I was just shocked and I started to go ahead faster with the forward button, stopping here and there looking for its redemption. But nothing, until the end. This is a completely brainless (in its bad meaning, not relaxing) movie, seems made by some stupid adolescent to spectators I really hoped didn't even exist. Define this as comedy is an offense to comedies, to compare it to ""animal house"" it is a sacrilege. Everything is annoying and forced, the actors, not a single joke worthy of note, not a single scene. Nothing, under any aspect, in this movie show a little mentality, it is just unintelligent, puerile and plain stupid. It was so bad that I removed from ""movie to see"" the others with Rogen as actor and Stoller as director. I do really hope this will not be the way the human culture is going to laugh and have fun. And yes it is 1/10 without any exaggeration by me, and it is 1 just because I couldn't give it 0 or less.Failed on all fronts. Just waste of time.",Neighbors
145,chris_rowe-881-168820,Don't get people's negativity,9,4 May 2014,"I will never understand why people slate films like this, comedies are never going to have Oscar winning performances or scripts, so to the people who come and review films like these I think why go in the first place, you watch different types of films for different reasons, comedies to laugh, romantic films for dates etc etc.....The main reservation I have with comedy films recently is that most seem to have all the best bits in the trailer and the rest of the film is kinda flat, this was not one of those at all. I laughed from start to finish and so did my girlfriend.I'm not the biggest seth rogan fan, I liked a few of his films and hated others but he was awesome in this, a real down to earth guy you can relate to, his wife played by Rose Byrne was also very funny, women tend to have comedic roles toned down in films but she was as good if not better than rogan. Their acting was good, they clicked well and seemed like a couple most could relate to.Then comes the frat boys, led by zac effron Christopher mintz plasse and Dave Franco who were all superb at what they did, considering they were all 6-10 years older than their roles they played them perfectly. Good chemistry between the group. Also had some great cameos including Lisa kudrow as the dean. The casting and acting were great. The actress who stole the show though was Stella played by twin babies, she is the cutest baby I have ever seen and was really funny. Zac effron although begrudgingly is one fit dude, he seems like a decent comedy actor as well, I loved 17 again so maybe this could be a more common role.Being English I don't fully understand fraternities and the American traditions and I'm unsure that a university would purchase real estate in a suburban neighbourhood knowing it to be a loud party filled mad house. But either way I don't care about how something may or may not happen it was a good plot and worked well throughout. Zac and seth were great together! The overall chemistry was great and the film looked so much fun to make.I loved this movie there are easily 15-20 hilarious moments which had some cinema goers clapping (that never happened when I saw the snoozefest gravity which is a supposed masterpiece) everything is there to make a good comedy film, chemistry, relate-able characters, a plot that if it happened to you you probably would act similar to how they played it! Start off as cool neighbours before entering all out war.The flat bits in the film where there's more dialogue were fine, it never felt slow or boring, the hilarity was well worth the wait. The film is easily the best comedy in years. I won't say much more than if you've been disappointed with recent comedies you won't be by this, go to the cinema or wait for DVD cut ages 10-30 will love this! Maybe even the older folks to, ignore the low reviews and scores , people have lost their sense of humour!9/10 must see",Neighbors
146,TheSeaLion,"Watch ""The Simpsons"" episode ""Two Bad Neighbors"" instead of this",3,17 May 2014,"""Neighbors"" reminded me of an episode of ""The Simpsons"" entitled ""Two Bad Neighbors"" where the former president moves in across the street from the Simpsons. Homer does not get along with his new neighbor and the two begin a feud with one another, pulling pranks and making the other's life miserable. The reason I bring this episode up is that it has a fairly similar premise to it, but it was done in a much better and funnier way.A fraternity presided over by the stereotypical obnoxious and out-of- control teenager Teddy Sanders (Zac Efron) moves in next to Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly (Rose Byrne) Radner, who have an infant daughter (Elise/Zoey Vargas) and are constantly making noise. Fearing to be branded as uncool, the Radners try to make an anonymous call to the police, but are sold out, creating tension between them and the fraternity. With the fraternity not about to leave, the Radners, along with their friends Jimmy (Ike Barinholtz) and Paula (Carla Gallo) try to get rid of the fraternity once and for all.Strangely, I find myself hating most of the characters in this movie. Almost every character in this movie is just immature and completely stupid. As I said, Zac Efron's character is the stereotypical frat boy who parties and makes a lot of noise. The Radners are our supposed heroes, but to get rid of the fraternity, they break into their house and set up Efron's girlfriend (Halston Sage) with his best friend Pete (Dave Franco). Jimmy and Paula, ex-spouses who are friends with the Radners complain about one another and then are suddenly back together at the end of the movie without any motivation for them to do so. The only character I found myself liking even a tiny bit was Pete, as he was the only one who was not acting immature every second of the film.Each group of characters, the Radners and the fraternity, both have a plot point to them that is unimportant to the whole story. The Radners daughter serves no purpose and their struggle with the fraternity and the plot of the movie would have been the same if they had a daughter or not. The fraternity has this wall of memorable moments in their fraternity's history, which Teddy wants to get put on at the end of the year by throwing a big party. At the end, this goal is never accomplished and it is completely forgotten by the end of the movie. I will give the movie credit because it is trying to have the theme of growing up, but none of the characters really grow up. Teddy does learn a lesson, but there is no buildup to it so it comes out of nowhere so we don't actually see him grow up, he just is suddenly grown up. The Radners just talk about how they like doing stuff that younger people would not like and they're suddenly all grown up. Jimmy and Paula just get back together and they don't seem to grow up at all. The only character who does grow up is Pete, and he was already the most adult one of all the characters. So, I admire that the film tried to have a theme, it just failed at it.The humor is mostly pop cultural reference and toilet humor, but some of it is just uncomfortable, and not in a good way. In a movie like ""Airplane!"", the part of the film with the little boy (Rossie Harris) and Captain Oveur (Peter Graves) is uncomfortable, but it is funny. In ""Neighbors"", there is a scene where the Radners are making out in front of their baby and it keeps watching them, yet they still keep trying to make out. There are other points where the joke goes on too long, an example being Teddy and Mac just discussing who they think the better Batman is an impersonating Christian Bale and Michael Keaton. While ""Neighbors"" makes genuine attempts at comedy and having a theme, it ultimately fails. The characters are unlikable and the comedy is unfunny. Watch the episode of ""The Simpsons"" I mentioned at the start of this review. It has a similar premise to it, but done so much better.",Neighbors
147,nzswanny,"Idiotic characters, idiotic story line...a well below average Seth Rogen film",4,24 May 2016,"It may be only 95 minutes long, but it felt like 2 hours long! Seth Rogen presents an unfunny movie with the worst story line, worst characters and most important of all, worse jokes! Instead of laughs, we are delivered a depressing movie instead of a comedy movie, and are expected to sit through the whole thing. Wow! Seth Rogen could of lost his career if this got the reviews it deserved, and that's just being nice! There wasn't a single laugh from me and overall, the picture is about as funny as a disabled guy falling down some stairs, which is pretty much what you'd expect from one of those spoof movies where you sort of go ""meh."" If you still aren't convinced about how bad this movie is, well, let's get started on describing the three big bad flaws in this film, which is story line, characters and humour. But I will also talk about movies that you may like if you liked this movie, so do keep reading the review to see if you'll like this movie. So, shall we get started on describing the flaws?STORYLINE: The story line was god awful! It's about two parents who have some teenagers that party and take drugs that move into their neighborhood, and the parents don't like the noise they're making in their parties. The parents go tell the teenagers to quiet the noise down, however the teenagers persuade them to join the party. The parents leave the baby behind somewhere, I don't know where, and the idiotic parents stay at the party for the night and take many drugs, including magic mushrooms. After that night, the parents go back to normal and go back home, and take care of the baby. But, the next night, the teenagers had another loud party. The parents try to call the teenagers to tell them to keep the noise down, but the teenagers don't, so the parents call the policemen. Because they did that, the stupid teenagers started making the poor parents have a living hell of a life! They harass them, leave condoms on their lawn, trim hedges with butts (don't tell me that's funny) and spy on the parents having sex so they have no privacy. Then the parents stay the night again their. That's pretty much the start of the movie, and I think you'd be able to consider about what you are getting into when watching Bad Neighbours. If that isn't convincing enough, let's explain about the idiotic characters! CHARACTERS: The parents leave the baby on the lawn when they went to the party over at the neighbors. How'd they get their baby back, exactly? They didn't quite explain that in the movie! The parents were dumb enough to go into the party AND take drugs that an adult their age should know not to take! But of course, these parents are idiots. They would just ditch their baby anywhere and go into their neighbor's house and have a party. What? Also, around the last half of the movie (this isn't a spoiler), a person is found getting an erection and the teenagers decide to throw some stuff at him because he got one. What? The characters are just so harsh! Also, the bush scene was just...bad. Not funny at all. Go look it up and have a watch of it, and you should be able to see how stupid the father is for...well, doing that to the bush.HUMOUR:It's tasteless, sex, sex, and a bit more sex mixed with Seth Rogen sex humour. That should explain what the humour is like. However, if that doesn't explain, let me explain to you some movies with the same humour as this, or at least similar humour. You will probably like this movie if you liked Movie 43, The Watch, This Is The End and The Hangover Part 2. If you like those movies I just said, you will probably enjoy this movie, so go ahead and have some fun with this movie. If you don't like any of those movies I just mentioned, don't watch this movie! Keep away from it!! This may not of been that much of a helpful review, but I hope it was helpful enough. Overall, I'd rate this a 4.3/10! And that's just being nice.",Neighbors
148,robinski34,Bad Moon Rising,6,28 June 2014,"In the increasingly regimented parlance of modern film criticism, Bad Neighbours might be described as a post-gross-out, frat house shock comedy. Lowering your expectations to accept casual bawdiness and a careless disregard for the consequences of ones actions will certainly help you enjoy this film. There are plenty of laughs to be had, but most of them are guilty ones. While great comedy is about subtlety, timing and emotional response, Bad Neighhbours is not, relying instead on the current penchant for shock, awe and improv. The film's problems are clear to see. Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne's new parents are not as sympathetic as they could be, and the conflict seems to go from an amiable 2 or 3 to all out war 11 very quickly. This is probably just about dealable with, but seeing the joins in the improv sail past as some gags outstay their welcome is unnecessary. Zac Efron probably emerges with the most credit, eschewing his heart-throb image to get his hands (and mouth) dirty as the frat king, ably supported by Dave Franco, and there are some other familiar faces to spot, including an underused Lisa Kudrow and Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who also has little to do. That Bad Neighbours does not pull its punches is a good thing, and there is sufficient to like and to laugh at (guiltily or otherwise) that shortcomings can be forgiven, especially after a glass of wine (or a keg). Watch out for a blink-and-miss-it cameo from Andy Samberg of Brooklyn Nine-Nine and SNL fame, although fans of Officer Peralta might be left wishing for more of the excellent cop comedy instead of the Bad Neighbours' schlock.",Neighbors
149,moviescoundrel,Not Mister Rogers Neighborhood,8,9 May 2014,"""Neighbors"" introduces the problem slowly. We first get introduced to Mac and Rose with a young baby girl in the middle of their attempt at procreating on a table, but can't quite get past their little girl giving them the stare down. They are new parents, in a new house, and neither one of them seems that content with their career decisions. Mac (Rogen) is in a job that he must take that serious since he smokes blunts outside during his breaks with no real care of getting fired. Interesting office job that allows that sort of thing. Kelly (Byrne) doesn't seem to be totally embracing the motherhood aspect of her life, or maybe is just too stressed to really enjoy and embrace her new role. So what could help transform and mature these new parents? Why what else, except the purchase and transfer of one of the local universities fraternity houses. Teddy (Efron) and Pete (Franco) are the fraternities president and vice president and after a few minutes, it is clear that they are probably not going to be the local community's best neighbors.What ensues for the next hour is a very humorous look at new parents trying to get through raising a child, and maintaining their marriage, while still trying to make their neighbors KEEP IT DOWN (the volume from the neighbors). This turns out be a very funny chess match of fraternity brothers vs. married couple as they fight for their right to either party or be left in peace. The film gives a pretty good glimpse at fraternity life, although the realism and probability of this scenario happening in real life is highly unlikely, it doesn't seem to take away from the believability, humor, and even some suspense as the events unfold and transpire on screen. I believe this was a win due to Stoller's ability.",Neighbors
150,stephenlovelette,Undershadowed,8,13 May 2014,"In a comedy, it's quite rare the female lead is just as funny as their male counterpart.The only other example is Leslie Mann and Paul Rudd in This is 40.But in Neighbors, Rose Byrne as Kelly Radner, is just as funny, if not funnier, than Seth Rogen as Mac Radner.The recent trend in Hollywood is to release multiple comedies during the summer season. Most of the time, the general public responds to one funny movie in particular, and that comedic blockbuster is what's remembered.Last year, the hit of the summer was This is the End, in 2012 it was Ted, in 2011 it was Bridesmaids, in 2010 it was Get Him to the Greek, in 2009 it was The Hangover.And, every year, another funny comedy is overshadowed by the success of the box office hit. Last year's We're the Millers, 2012's 21 Jump Street, 2011's Horrible Bosses, and 2010's Hot Tub Time Machine.'09 was a rough year, but '08 makes up for it with some serious winners. Step Brothers is the most fondly remembered of that year, but let's not forget Pineapple Express and Zack and Miri Make a Porno. (I'm a sucker for anything with Craig Robinson.)Seth MacFarlane's A Million Ways to Die in the West comes out May 30, so it'll be interesting to see which movie ends up overshadowing the other.Because Neighbors is great!With an awesome cast, subject material that is both relatable and timely, and a hysterical script; director Nicholas Stoller's got himself another winner here, folks.Zac Efron's performance in Neighbors is fantastic. He really sells it. Oftentimes, like with Barbra Streisand in The Guilt Trip, a daring cameo can fall short. In Barbra's case, her performance feels very artificial; like it's been jammed into a comedy for outrageous effect. And unfortunately, her acting abilities just aren't meant for making the modern audience laugh.But Zac pulls it off; he plays a compelling and likable character, whom the audience feels compassion for. Not once does he feel out of place or miscast. There isn't a single slip-up in terms of acting performance and he fits in quite well leading alongside Seth Rogen.Rogen, for me, is always hilarious. But whether you like him or not, there's plenty of other stuff to laugh at. Did I mention how funny Rose Byrne is?I like that Dave Franco. He's great in this movie, and is turning into quite a talented actor.Neighbors earns its 'R' rating through a bevy of phallic jokes. One of the film's high-points is the sheer number of comedic performances it gets out of a cast of knowns and unknowns alike.A young black actor, Jerrod Carmichael, plays a frat boy named Garf. His scene-stealing hilarious moments are numerous, and I've never heard of him before. But I wouldn't mind seeing a lot more Carmichael in the future.There are particular sequences worthy of note.The first is a montage of period pieces; three scenes with different styles of shooting, depicting moments in the fraternity's history. Each is led by cameos from comedic favorites, including the guys from Lonely Island, the Workaholics trio, and Jake Johnson from New Girl.The other is reflective of an overall theme in Neighbors. It's a movie for major cinephiles because there are tons of films references throughout. The 'Robert De Niro' party is one of the most uproarious moments and has the entire theater rollicking with laughter.One funny thing is the cameo by Jason Mantzoukas (as Dr. Theodorakis). He's well-known as Rafi on FX's The League. His character in Neighbors utilizes the same gag as the misleading doctor in Arrested Development. A similar joke appears in Family Guy and 30 Rock.A final matter worth mentioning are the modern issues it offers commentary on. Lisa Kudrow has one of the funniest cameos as Dean Carol Gladstone, and all she's concerned with are newspaper headlines.In several ways, the movie makes a compelling argument for the harmlessness of fraternities. As of late, much to-do has been made over the evils of frat life. It's nice to see somebody finally arguing for the other side.Overall, Neighbors is a riotous batch of fresh laughs from a combination of reliable comedic mainstays and surprisingly proficient newcomers.Whether it's overshadowed by A Million Ways to Die in the West in a few weeks is of little concern.For the time being, just know Neighbors is worth a trip to the theater!",Neighbors

Aside from that, it's not very funny. A lot of the humor and situations have been used in films like Old School, Animal House, Superbad, Project X, etc. and to greater effect. If you enjoy seeing Seth Rogen naked and numerous comical situations revolving around dildos, this will be your movie. If that's not the case, don't rely on the dialog to save the movie.My friend and I were getting annoyed at the frantic, panicky ""back and forth"" dialog between Seth Rogen and his wife (played by Rose Byrne). It really consisted of them saying the same thing over and over, back and forth (the camera moves rapidly suggesting we should find this funny). An example of this is when they are discussing how they should tell the fraternity house to keep the noise level down; Rogen: ""Keep it down,"" Byrne: ""Keep it dooown."" Rogen: ""Keep it doooooown,"" Byrne: ""Keeeeeeep it Doooooooown."" The movie is full of scenarios like this which I find to be truly unfunny and sadly characteristic of Rogen's most recent movies, another being bad acting.One of the only good actors in this movie which surprised me to say the least, was Zac Efron. He didn't have much to work with, but he was funny when he needed to be and also serious when the situation called for it. The family friend to Rogen, played by Ike Barinholtz (had to look him up) was atrociously acted and written. He dropped the N-word a couple times which just seemed random and didn't fit in well. Considering his other film roles include ""Disaster Movie,"" and ""Meet the Spartans,"" I'm not surprised he sucked it up in this movie.This movie is just not that good. It tries to go 0-60 from the start, but it stalls out relatively early. Jokes miss, situations fall apart, dialog stinks, characters are shallow and flat, and you just can't wait for it to be over.

Long review: The movie is essentially two of the most immature and irresponsible parents on this planet who live next door to a dozen of the most immature and irresponsible college frat boys. They each try to force the other to move out of their respective houses. Humorous hijinks were supposed to ensue. They did not. Unless you find the following things inherently funny: 1) the ""F"" bomb 2) Hearing jokes about male genitalia 3) Seeing male genitalia 4) Toilet humor 5) Seeing an infant playing with a condom If you are already busting a gut reading the above list, then you will enjoy the film. Otherwise I can't recommend it. There is no plot, no characters. Most of it seemed like 90 minutes of improv with the direction being ""be as vulgar as you can be, use every profanity you can think of, every dirty joke you have ever heard of. Now go!"" Seriously. I am probably making the film seem more fun than it was. If the parents were educated, respectable, intelligent and upright people, then contrasting them with the frat boys might have given way to some legitimate humor. By having the parents be just as stupid and immature as the fraternity, there was no contrast. Everyone was stupid, childish, and vulgar. How this movie avoided an NC-17 rating is beyond me. I think my friend, who went with me to see it for free, summed up the experience the best. ""well, the price was right."" A part of me hopes this film bombs. If too many people actually find this infantile and vulgar film really funny, then it may erode my faith in humanity.

154,john32935,Not worth visiting this Neighbor-hood,2,8 February 2015,"A truly awful attempt at comedy. Not sure that there a single line or scene that had even the slightest chance of generating laughter. Roughly set - the fraternity (led by Zac Efron, looking more and more like John Stamos) moves in next door and causes too much noise for the family (Seth Rogen, Rose Byrne) raising a baby. First, the neighbors attempt to win the boys over by being cool. Being cool meaning spending all-night at the frat party and watching the baby through the use of a baby- monitor. Good parenting at its best, but the premise can be overlooked in the pursuit of comedy.When the boys have another party and do not respond to phone calls to keep it down, the neighbors call the cops who are as unsympathetic to their plight as could be imagined. And so, taking matters into their own hands, begins the ever-escalating attempts to get the frat boys to leave or to be banned by the school, and the counterattacks to make the neighbors truly miserable.Nothing original. All over the top. Not grounded in any semblance of reality. The writers and director should rewatch Animal House to see how this genre was meant to be made.And the ""good news"" - this movie made so much money that a sequel has just been announced.

155,Kingkitsch,Seth Rogen's back hair + utter stupidity = Neighbors,1,5 December 2014,"You know you're in trouble when you get an eyeful of Seth Rogen's back hair within seconds of the start of this crapfest. Before the credits even roll, you are bombarded with lousy sex jokes and some of the lamest dialog ever written, to wit: ""I'm taking you to Bonertown"". Throw a baby, a house next door overrun by frat boys from Hell, and 100K F bombs and penis gags into the mix and you reach for the remote wondering where the fast forward button is located. If this is truly the state of American cinematic comedy, we might as well just hold the funeral now and get it over with. Who was this movie made for? Evidently the 15-to-18 high school bro demographic who find incessant dick, drug, and party jokes totes adorb! I only watched the first two scenes, and the last two. Everything you needed to know was in the opening, and the resolution was exactly what you knew would happen in the closing moments. All that happened between didn't need to be seen. The old chestnut about dissimilar neighbors duking it out over petty squabbles is pretty much played out, but Rogen and Co. don't care. They simply up the ante here, swearing like ten-year olds who just learned a dirty word, taking drugs with wild abandon, and hammering the same point over and over with the occasional gay joke thrown in to spice things up. I pity those who stuck it out for the entire running time. At the finale, watching two men fight with dildos and yelling ""I'm Batman"" at each other is akin to the Death of a Thousand Cuts. You just pray for it to be over.There is however, a very strange thread running through this truly awful movie: Seth Rogen's character seems overly obsessed with Zac Efron's body. Rogen rambles on about it from the first time he sees Efron's character. How hot he is, his arms, etc. The final scenes are more of this same odd behavior in front of Abercrombie and Fitch. Rogen tells the shirtless Efron that Efron's torso is ""an arrow pointing to his penis"". Really. Maybe this was really just a bromance all the time? Rogen appears to have the hots for Efron, but I really don't want to know about it. One of the worst movies of 2014, and obviously a misstep for all involved. Let's see how long everyone involved in this stinker keeps it on their resume. I've already seen this movie in the five-buck bin at a local Wal-mart, which is still too much to pay to suffer through it.",Neighbors
156,slicedbread117,Some occasional big laughs can't save Neighbors from disappointing,6,9 May 2014,"There's one major issue that kept me from giving two thumbs up to Neighbors: the fact that this is college level humor. The inability to create a decent slew of logical and well thought out jokes makes Neighbors just another stab at pulling in a comedy-redundant, high school/college audience, and the lack of said laughs hurt the movie to the point of no return.There's a way to tell when you're watching a ""immature"" movie, if you will. When you're in an audience that is filled with about 80 percent of people 16-22 years old (myself included) and there's an enormous uproar of laughter when Zac Efron's character unintentionally hits himself with a beer can by throwing it off a mini trampoline, and almost no laughter during the brief Robert De Niro-themed party, with hilarious references to the legendary actor's movies, you know you're in trouble. Unfortunately, there is too much focus on dumbed down humor, featuring cheesy drug, sexual, and modern culture related humor. Now don't get me wrong, the use of these elements in humor can be down right hilarious, and is vital for plenty of successful comedies. Without a doubt, Neighbors had me laughing out loud on a few different occasions, providing some great laughs using the aforementioned elements of humor quite well. But it's the way that the humor is played out in Neighbors that makes it feel so forgettable, specifically the college fraternity setting that the film's humor bases itself off of. The screenplay just simply doesn't have enough depth to attract a larger audience than the younger aged group I previously mentioned. While in its own right this is completely fine, Neighbors sacrifices widespread success for the acceptance of a younger audience.For the most part, plot is not really too important in a comedy unless, of course, the plot is ridiculously funny. The plot in Neighbors is not important or enticing at all. Neighbors aims to display a theme that is ultimately a story of realization that the good old days have to put behind you to provide for a better future. In its purest sense, the message delivered in the movie is not bad, especially for a crazy, party filled comedy film. It gives what's most likely to be a college audience an idea that life isn't just one big party. I applaud the larger, yet subtle theme that director Nicholas Stoller displays in the background of 96 minutes of getting really high and watching very awkward Seth Rogen sex. Speaking of Seth Rogen...let's face it, Seth Rogen, (with the possible exception of ""This Is the End"") hasn't put out a truly enjoyable movie since 2008's Pineapple Express. Co-staring alongside pop culture phenom Zac Efron, Rogen again has a roller coaster performance: laughing out loud one minute, and then aimlessly watching his jokes for the next 15. I find Seth Rogen hilarious on most occasions, but it's time he moves on to a project that feels different. Something outside of his box, rather than continuously playing a fat pot head over and over again. Zac Efron surprisingly delivers the better performance of the two co-stars. I originally expected Efron to be just eye candy for the said younger audience, and while he does show off his good looks for the ladies quite a bit in the film, his acting chops hold up just fine as well, and he provides some solid laughs throughout. The supporting cast includes Rose Byrne as Rogen's wife Kelly, who at times can be funny but really is down right annoying during most instances. Dave Franco, who potentially takes the cake as the best actor in the movie, with his charm and wit winning me over. And the underused Christopher Mintz-Plasse, also known as the famous McLovin, whose screen time is limited, but memorable nonetheless. Overall, the cast was OK, showing the potential resurrection of Zac Efron, rise of Dave Franco, but also the decline of Seth Rogen.So is Neighbors an absolutely God-awful movie? No, it's not. There are still plenty of decent laughs to be had while watching this comedy. However, most of the parts this movie aims to be the funniest, are the parts where the true lack of comedic depth show deepest. While the plot's message was a pleasant surprise for the movie, and most of the acting remains moderately entertaining throughout the film, the poor screenplay, filled with too much dumbed down humor, and the so-so performance by Seth Rogen among others doesn't give Neighbors a fighting chance to be recognized as a memorable comedy in my repertoire.6/10",Neighbors

Effron, besides being buff and shirtless in almost every scene (poor guy), was pretty funny along with Dave Franco. In my mind, their antics and comedic timing saved this ""Animal House"" want to be movie, which it was not even close at being.Too many, far too many, gratuitous scenes to get a laugh and few did. The actress playing Rogan's wife was also one of the reasons I kept watching - she played the ex-college rabble-rouser turned responsible mom character very well.If you want to see Effron prance around half naked through most of the movie, then watch away.I was hoping for a lot of laughs, instead I only got a few.",Neighbors

Let's see how many times we can show sex, gratuitous or supposedly otherwise.I will keep posting about how offensive the language is in today's films. Do people really talk this way? Do writers/directors think if they cleaned up 75% of the obscenities that they would LOSE theater-goers? If you have a good movie, everyone will enjoy it.

160,thomas-w15,Kind of funny but never reaches the next level of comedy,5,22 November 2014,"Neighbors 5.5/10- One of the reasons that myself and most of the general public thought that This is the End was so funny was because the guys making it knew how stupid it was and they were able to achieve great success because they played off that factor. Neighbors, on the other hand, does try to be serious at times and I think that if they just continued to just do non-sense the whole way through, like This is the End, they would have gone to the next level of comedy. Neighbors achieves at being a solid R-rated comedy with the perfectly casted actors and a nice handful of jokes, but does still disappoint in its effort to really stand out from all of the other R-rated comedies that have come out over the past couple years.Now, I am not saying this movie does not have its fair share of those dumbass moments because after all its premise is a street war between a well-to-do couple and a wild, hard partying fraternity. Moments where a baby is playing with a condom or whose the real batman talk were really some of the golden moments in this film simply because they were just so stupid that they were funny. More writing like those would have made Neighbors twice as good as This is the End. One thing that I really applaud this movie for the most is getting a perfect cast. Seth Rogen ,playing the out of touch, thirty-something father that is desperately tries to keep some excitement in his life, paired up with Rose Byrne ,who surprisingly had the best performance in this film, were both comedic gold together. The chemistry between a couple where one is clearly hotter never gets old and I have not seen a pair as good as these two since Will Ferrell and Eva Mendes in The Other Guys. Now we come to the antagonist of the film, Zac Efron. He is perfect for playing a dumb frat guy who ends up getting in an escalated neighbor battle with Seth Rogen. These three all just played so well off each others performances and really if the writing and directing was just a little better, they all could have done wonders with this film. There is not much else to say about a comedy like this one due to its simplicity in the writing that was almost, for lack of a better term ""stupid enough."" I am not saying at all it is a bad movie, I still think it is a solid comedy and with the lack of solid comedies right now I definitely recommend Neighbors if all you want is to relax and have some good laughs.For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",Neighbors

164,yourfavoritecritic,Another Mediocre Outing From Rogen and the Gang,5,9 April 2020,"Neighbors, directed by Nicholas Stoller, is a 2014 comedy starring Seth Rogen, Rose Byrne and Zac Efron. The film follows a couple with a newborn baby taking drastic measures to evict a fraternity that just moved in next to them. Neighbours was met with pleasant critical and audience reception, so back in 2014 I was somewhat anticipating the film, however once I finally saw it I was left wanting a bit more, and after seeing again a couple years later the feeling still remained.Now starting off with the good, I like the concept for the film, it's something that (sure has been done before) can present some funny antics and although I don't feel like they were always capitalized upon, the film still did have some memorable sequences. A large part of that is thanks to set design and cinematography, though this film does feature the cliche 2010's comedy colour pallet of really bright colours, I felt this film used it to its advantaged and had moments that I would not expect in a summertime comedy flick, such as the moment where Zac Efron's character, Teddy, begins to lose his mind. The use of dutch angles and strobe lights during this scene is something that'll stick with me, making me associate that scene with the film for a very long time. Speaking of Teddy, Zac Efron, is probably the best part of the film. This is seemingly one of his most dramatic roles despite it being a comedy, his character goes through a range of emotions throughout the film and I thought he played his part well. Even though his character arc may be a little cliche, it did go some places I did not expect for this type of movie.I'm not going to pretend this film is some masterclass comedy with deep themes, as a majority of it remains very forgettable. It doesn't push any boundaries that makes the film feel memorable outside of the aforementioned Teddy. There's many jokes that don't land, most of the time feeling lazy, like ""boy, isn't it tough being a parent, we can't do the stuff we used to do anymore"", I suppose a handful of new parents or millennials could find this funny. Speaking of millennials I should mention that I kind of liked how they juxtaposed older people born in that generation (i.e. Rose Bryne and Seth Rogen's characters) against the ones born later (the fraternity), but outside of the surface level comparison there's not much more that was done with that theme.By far my biggest complaint with the film had to be, the filmmakers not knowing whether to make something based in reality, or something that is outrageous. Instead the final package is sort of an ""in-between"", and doesn't know what it wants to be. The film will feature something realistic, such as consequences the characters could face, but then the next scene is completely over-the-top, and left me with a feeling of uncertainly as to what this type of comedy it wants to be taken as. That is one of my biggest issues with most mainstream/Seth Rogen comedies, and why I find them to be very average. Either be completely absurdist like a This is the End or The Jump Street movies, or stick with an authentic mood like a St. Vincent. Pick a tone, and stand firm with it, don't try and be a middle man trying to juggle both, as it rarely succeeds.Overall, Neighbors, was a very average comedy that will probably get lost amongst the midst of other forgettable 2010 comedies. Despite having a concept that could've been funny, it just didn't capitalize on it. I'm sure there's people out there who will get enjoyment out of this film, however it is something that just didn't work for me, and for that reason I'm giving Neighbors a 5/10.",Neighbors

Bad neighbours can stand proudly in that pantheon of utter dross.This film just keeps delivering just when you expect it to improve it continues in the same formulaic vein, vacuous genital and drug humour proliferate like in most of Rogens work.If you had any growing disenchantment with Rogen then watching this garbage will truly cement your dislike of him. Its just the same old fecal matter.It is 90 minutes of unforgiving sewage. Nobody comes out of this film unscathed, all who took part should bow their heads in shame.As someone else has pointed out, the IMDb rating seems way off, i came on the site expecting it to have received a generous 4.5, maybe 5 but for it to get a 7 is just ridiculous, even Rogen fans would have to admit to this being an extremely unfunny effort. I couldn't wait for the end, i spent the first 20 minutes trying to like it, which is never a good sign, but then, as it began to dawn on me that it wasn't going to improve but actually get worse, i just wanted it to all be over and if it wasn't for the company i was in i'd have gotten up and walked out.",Neighbors

A look into what parenthood may be like for us when we hit our early 30s.Out of nowhere, as if brought in by the Gods of ""lets mess your life up"" wanted fun, Teddy (Efron) and Pete (Franco) move in next door with their College fraternity Delta Psi. A few nights after they move in Mac and Kelly go around to complain about the noise, however end up getting high as kits and drunk as skunks, during this night is probably the funniest scene in the entire movie. When Mac and Teddy have a Batman-off, obviously Keaton vs Bale.And obviously as movies go, their unlikely allegiance doesn't last, in few scenes afterwards Mac and Kelly are complaining once again about the noise to the cops. Setting off and almighty battling feud between both households. Resulting in at one point Mac flooding their basement in order to try and draw them away.I can't really say much more without ruining pranks and what are supposed to be funny scenes, however for me all the funniest parts where given away in trailers with the exception being the Bat-off.Overall, if you were to take the opinion of reviewers to heart, I would personally say it's and OK watch. However wait for a friend to buy it or until it is on a streaming website like Netflix or Amazon. I will say it is not the worst Comedy movie I have ever seen, just not as a good as other Comedies.

167,InMyHonestOpinion,An improv disaster film. If disgusting is your thing you'll love it.,4,26 December 2014,"So I have a riddle for you What do you get when you cross Seth Rogan, Rose Byrne, Zac Efron, Dave Franco and as much vulgarity and utter crudeness you can fit into 96 minutes of film?!? Oh my, such a horrible film, there was so much wrong with this film it was laughable. I have no idea what happened to the script or director but at some point it seemed to be let go and ""say whatever the hell you wish to say"" came into play. The scenes between Seth and Rose who play new parents Mac and Kelly tried ridiculously over the top to just be ""real"" but failed so hard it was laughable and usually quite sickening to watch and hear. So one day while Mac (Seth Rogan) and Kelly (Rose Byrne) are enjoying their new bundle of joy: baby Stella, some new neighbours begin moving in, it's quickly realised that it's not just a family but a frat house a rather loud and rude bunch of boys and their pledges for the New Year. Mac and Kelly decide to go next door and introduce themselves and in one way or another ask the frat brothers ""to keep it down"". Soon enough Teddy (Zac Efron) and Pete (Dave Franco) Break their word and the noise wakes Stella so Mac and Kelly decide (even though the promised they wouldn't) to call the police for a noise complaint. This is when the war begins, the frat brothers do all they can to upset their neighbours and the neighbours do all they can to get the frat house expelled from its college. That's the story. Throw in some of the most stupid dialogue ever put to film, acting skills that belong in a Year 7 end of year play and enough crudeness and total vulgarity to make Richard Pryor turn in disgust and you'll have Bad Neighbours. Rose Byrne is the films saving grace, she is a very funny lady even though she has one of the most disturbing scenes involving mothers milk she has more to give than anyone else in the entire film, unfortunately though she still has to put up with the shocking script but does her best to make it work. Seth I'm sorry mate but I feel your time has come, it's time to give up the films and maybe go back and learn how to be somewhat funny again. I do feel that the couplings that were made could actually work if given the right equipment, I thought Zac Efron and James Franco were actually good characters it's just what they were made to do that ruined it for me. I would actually watch another film with the same characters as long as there was a new writer and new director. I'm sorry but this is by far director Nicolas Stollers worst film to date Why couldn't he deliver another ""Get Him to the Greek""?!? Or even ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall""?!? I was expecting so much more from this. So my final thoughts for this film are; If you are rude, crude, and crass you will most likely love this film, but I think the audience for this film are most likely still in high school and playing most of the games the frat boys are playing either with each or other or themselves.",Neighbors

169,swellframe17,Another exaggerated college comedy.,6,13 July 2014,"2 1/1 out of 4 stars.Nicholas Stoller's ""Neighbors"" is a college comedy that is similar to ""Animal House."" It's about Mac and Kelly Radner (played by Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne, respectively) whose new neighbor is a college fraternity led by Teddy (Zac Effron) and Pete (Dave Franco). The Radners have a newborn daughter and are both excited and scared by their new neighbors. A happy beginning soon turns into a war between the Radners and the fraternity. Comedy ensues. ""Neighbors"" is another exaggerated college comedy that gets caught up in the crazy fraternity parties. It can be funny at times, but it can get very raunchy and the jokes can be a little stale. There's a great scene towards the end of the film where Rogen and Effron fight. It's hilarious. I think Stoller's ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" was great, but didn't enjoy his ""Get Him to the Greek' as much. His ""The Five Year Engagement"" and ""Neighbors"" fall into an in between section for me. Rogen and Byrne have good chemistry and Effron and Franco are solid as the fraternity students. I liked how the film looked at the transition from college to the ""real"" world and questions if we ever truly grow up. Is there always some part of us that will be that crazy college kid? It's an interesting idea to me and I liked how the film handled those scenes. Stoller's ""Neighbors"" is a decent college comedy with enough laughs to make it worth watching. I think most college students and adults can relate to the struggle of wanting to be a college kid and wanting to be an adult. It's a film for people who liked those exaggerated comedies and Appatow films. If you don't like raunchy and exaggerated humor, you probably won't enjoy this movie as much.",Neighbors

171,anthonymora2,Neighbors,7,10 May 2014,"To start of this review, let me note that this movie just happened to be released around the exact same week that my own personal life is taking a drastic step forward. This movie is a foreshadowing of my future... kind of. Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne are a couple who are just starting their lives as parents. They have a beautiful baby girl, moved into a nice looking neighborhood, and are going through some of the obstacles that come with this raising a child. Their picture perfect world soon takes a belly flop into a pool of debauchery and ""turnt upness"" when a college fraternity move into the neighboring house. At first, they try to come to a peaceful agreement and settle on some ground rules, but of course that's no fun! Soon an all out battle ensues between the two houses and also some battles within the characters add to the drama and there we have the clear Summer Comedy to beat this year. I'm a fan of Rogen, always have been. Does he pretty much do the same role in every film he's in? Sure, but Seth Rogen is probably the only actor working today where the shtick just works every time. He bring his usual ""lovable man child"" plate to the table, but let me talk about his two opposites in the movie. First, Rose Byrne... wow! Not only is she just a pretty face, but she was great in her role. She plays Rogen's wife and while he's spitting out crude joke after crude joke, she knocks it out of the park with her comedic chops and really was a great counterpart to Seth Rogen. I like her in the Insidious movies, I absolutely LOVED her in this one. Now Mr. Zac Efron, you sir, have finally shut me up. Like every other guy around my age, we all try to scrape anything High School Musical out of our minds, Efron was just another piece of eye candy for the ladies with some pretty poor film choices. He shines in this one and really surprised me, he was actually pretty funny and even pulled off some good dramatic scenes with very goo d acting. This is by far his best vehicle. Dave Franco was alright and there are some pretty sweet cameos spread through out this movie.The cast can only be as good as the movie itself and the movie is pretty excellent. The chemistry between all the actors is really good, it adds a lot of heart to the movie and that heart works surprisingly well with the raunchy, R-rated comedic material. The movie is also directed really well, it actually has the look of a film unlike most Adam Sandler movies. The party scenes are really cool with great use of lights and set. Director, Nicholas Stoller has made decent comedies in the past, this is now my favorite film of his.There comedy hits hard and the more grounded, softer moments feel welcomed instead of just being there to try to make a sappy moment. There were some minor flaws for me, like the scene with a police officer completely doing his job wrong, then there's scenes with a dean and a home Realtor that were unbelievably fake, but the comedy masks it. There were also some joke moments that may have dragged on for a bit too long.Neighbors is the best comedy of the year. It's slim pickings sure, but this one was good enough that I really don't see much competition anywhere down the road, 22 Jump Street better blow it's predecessor out of the water. The cast is enjoyable and the comedy works, this is a great summer comedy that threw enjoyable surprises at me while also giving me the grown man child comedy that I've loved from this group.",Neighbors

As many people pointed out in their review, I wish to reiterate that this movie barely broke a laugh in me too whilst watching it, in fact I found myself at a struggle on various scenes on whether to force a laugh in empathy to the actors or just sit silent like watching a crappy documentary.The first 15mins of the film unravels OK, and the movie appears to have some form of a decent plot, this is later steam-rolled by cliché acts of revenge and incoherent verbal abuse like a shitty mash-up of Home Alone and Van Wilder.This movie could have been done in 60mins flat, but my guess is that 1.) Zac Effron begged the producer to appear ""more shirt-less"" (with that tanned/waxed body of a 13 year old gym junkie) and 2.) The rest of the cast threw in improbable situations that they thought would be funny. At no point throughout the length of this movie was I immersed enough to believe the current exchange of tripe was somewhat real, it was overshadowed by shitty facial expressions and horrid acting.Keep away from this.",Neighbors
176,Nothinggrandproductions,It's stupid in a great way,9,3 June 2014,"I love stupid comedies. And no I don't mean like Adam Sandler stupid. I mean a more self-awareness of stupidity like Seth Rogen movies or most of the movies out of the Apatow group of people. I loved Neighbors. Why? Well I have plenty of reasons why. For one thing, it mixes raunchy humor and pop culture references with ease throughout the entire movie and still has a slight underlying sense of plot with the characters despite it being minimal. For me, I was consistently laughing throughout the entire thing and it's one of the funniest comedies I've seen in quite awhile especially in regards to R-rated comedies. The concept is fairly simple, a couple (Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne) live in a quiet, suburban neighborhood with their baby until a bunch of frat boys move in next to them lead by Teddy Sanders (Zac Efron). This basically causes a war between the couple and the frat boys with them trying to best each other and mess with each other as much as possible. The war between these two different groups causes plenty of crazy things to happen including Robert De Niro impressions, lots and lots of drugs and pop culture references, sex and more sex, airbags used in the most violent way possible, etc, plenty of gags and raunchy humor throughout that I personally found funny.Some people were ""offended"" by the movie and for some people I guess the humor didn't work which the latter being understandable. I think people get way too easily offended by most things and need to get over it but I found myself laughing pretty much from start to finish. Zac Efron has officially moved on from his Disney stardom and become a solidified figure in comedy in my eyes which started with Josh Radnor's Liberal Arts and now with this movie, he kills it in nearly every scene with great comedic execution and a great portrayal of the stereotypical dumb frat guy. Seth Rogen is typically good in his roles, your opinion of him won't change from this movie if you already don't like him but I do, the guy is funny to me. Rose Byrne also does a great job and isn't an actress I actually recognized but later found out I've seen her in a few films before. Dave Franco is also fantastic which I expected especially after 21 Jump Street. The cast as a whole is hilarious and plays off each other well. The movie isn't sophisticated nor does it try to be, it's aware that it is a dumb comedy with lots of dumb but fun jokes and pop culture references like Kevin James or President Obama or Breaking Bad, I appreciate the awareness, I appreciate the fact that dumb comedies like this can still be appreciated by those who aren't offended like myself, who don't really have a filter and are perfectly okay with that, I like swear words and dumb sex jokes and dumb things if done with an awareness of their dumbness. That's my ending point here, Neighbors is stupid and fun and that's why it's good because it's stupid and fun and knows it and no, there isn't some ""ironic"" love (forget that) for this movie I honestly and genuinely loved it and it's one of the best comedies I've seen in awhile.",Neighbors

Moving on, the plot moves quickly and there are a lot of funny moments during the first 30 minutes. It has a decent running time (96 min) but it feels very short, the movie is so entertaining and funny, 10 minutes more would be great.The dialog is a little bit overcooked and quite insane sometimes. Neighbors is for a very specific audience, it's a very crude comedy. Also, I loved the cast, Rose Byrne was terrific! there's a scene involving her boobs and it's definitely the best scene in the movie. Zac Efron gives his most standout performance since ""Hairspray"" and Seth Rogen as I said he's just watchable. In addition, Dave Franco was great too and he has the most realistic character in the whole film; finally, there's a cute baby called ""Stella"" and she will steal your heart. (B+)",Neighbors

Oh and Dave Franco, I mistook him for his brother James Franco (I was telling my friend the guy in Bad Neighbours was the Harry Osborne in the Spiderman trilogy) and then started wondering why is he shorter than Zac Efron (Oops!). If you've watched the trailer, you will know why is the film hilarious, and guess what, those are NOT the only funny parts. I'm so glad that there were more than that (hint: the airbags; and you will know what I mean when you watch it.)Yea, I know you'll think I'm biased for rating the movie so high because there's Zac Efron, which is true because I watched the movie BECAUSE of Zac Efron, but I did not come up with the rating.

Heading the fraternity, Teddy (Zac Efron) and his deputy, Pete (Dave Franco) party for a living. Teddy somehow reminded me of Leonardo DiCaprio's in Wolf of Wallstreet, albeit a younger, milder version, with a body much hotter! Whereas Pete's the brain who stayed for brotherhood and besides the butt-showing scene, it was difficult for Dave Franco to perform much beside a charming Zac Efron. No worries, he's still charismatic in his own ways. The rest of the guys don't make much of an impression, OK fine, with exception of Christopher Mintz-Plasse (from Kick-Ass) as a minor sidekick, Jerrod Carmichael for his accidental waxing and Craig Roberts for his ""honesty"" which are enough to make me return to the cinemas again.Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne Seriously, if I'm to have a family next time, I hope my relationship with my husband will be like Mac and Kelly's.

183,sunshinebeachcinema,Bad Neighbours? Bad Movie.,4,27 May 2014,"Bad Neigbours (2014) Directed by Nicholas Stoller; Starring Seth Rogen, Zac Efron, Rose ByrneRating: 2/5This film was simply called Neighbors in the US, but was renamed Bad Neighbours in the English speaking commonwealth to avoid confusion with the popular Australian soap of the same name. The international title's more on the money. The neighbours are bad, and the movie is bad.It's not atrocious, there are a couple of laughs, but there are only a couple, and that's hardly enough to justify forcing yourself through all the dildo, condom and erection-based humour the movie throws at you. We know sexual comedy can be done well – just look at the American Pie series, which remained consistently well written and hilarious over four films and for over ten years – so what's going wrong here?The basic premise is that of a young family (Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne) who are unlucky enough to have a college fraternity (led by Zac Efron and Dave Franco) move in next door. The frat boys want to party all night, and the couple want them to keep the noise down so they, and their daughter, can sleep.It's a decent enough if simple premise, further developed by the family's desperate attempts to remain 'cool' and down with the kids, even attending a few of the frat parties, and the frat boys legitimate attempts to build bridges, even if they refuse to stop partying.Once the family call in the cops with a noise complaint, all bets are off, and what ensues is a chronicles of steadily escalating one- upmanship which makes bitter enemies out of both parties. What's slightly jarring is that there are plenty of occasions when there is a genuine chance to bury the hatchet, but both sides often chose the pettier, and more destructive option. We're supposed to go along with it all; although it's not clear which side we're supposed to take (it could depend on your own generation), rendering the conflict inconsequential.This is part of the deconstruction the film is attempting of fraternities in general: that they are essentially a bunch of overgrown children with little to no maturity – and this extends to the characters played by Rogen and Byrne. Ultimately, it all feels a little too despicable, and alienates all the characters from the audience.The film also brings the relatively dated atmosphere of Animal House (1978) into the 21st Century, making the fraternity setting contemporarily relevant and showing its effect on the wider community. If you think that means more drugs, more drink and more sex, then you'd be half-right, but there was plenty of that in Animal House to begin with. Here, it essentially translates to more neon, and to an extent, more fireworks.While it's very much a film of the moment, there are a number of currently chuckle worthy references which will severely date the film in years to come. Of some note is Lisa Kudrow's brief appearance as a truly useless college dean.I went to see this movie for some comedy and to keep my head in the modern world. It's just shy of okay, but if I wanted something that fit that glove, I should have stayed at home and continued watching the cheesy vampire and zombie movies I've been watching for the past couple of weeks. What is a relief is that it's not too long. That's not because I was desperate for it to end, but because so many films these days simply don't know when to rein it in. This restraint is commendable.",Neighbors
184,oscarxp25,Efron shines but the movie is forgettable,6,12 May 2014,"Seth Rogen has been the king of comedy for the last ten years. From ""The 40 year old Virgin"" to last year's ""This is the End"", he has given us comedy that glorifies the slackers. In the new comedy ""Neighbors"" Seth's character, Mac, is the most stable of his friends. He has a beautiful wife, who is played by Rose Bryne, a house, and a precious young baby. He appears to be the responsible one, but he still yearns for the days where he had no responsibility. It is an attitude that the film shares. It has something to say but is afraid of fully saying it.Kelly (Bryne) and Mac are doing everything to keep away from becoming what every young person fears..boring. They try to act youthful, fun, and irresponsible, but with a child in the house that goal is impossible to achieve. They crave the excitement they shared in their youth. Their stable world is shaken up when a fraternity buys and moves into a house next door. The leader of the young frat is Teddy Sanders. Sanders is played by Zac Efron, who does quite well in this film with both the comedy and limited dramatic scenes he is given. At first, both parties try to appease one another but it is obvious that ship is going to go down quite quickly. Even after Mac and Kelly attend one of the parties and bond with the frat, promising not to call the cops, they fold on that promise and this is where the games begin.The back and forth antics of both sides are humorous but really add nothing new to the genre. The best gag involving three stolen airbags has been played to death in all the advertisements for the film. Even so, each scene just feels like a bunch of skits tied together instead of having that natural flow a comedy film should contain. Though I must say that one of Bryne's ideas on how to break up the frat is very smart and played off perfectly. It is one of the few moments where the film really comes alive and feels something of its own. Bryne is fun and doesn't play it safe in this film. She really does well with the comedy. Rogen though comes off as tired. His act is starting to seem old. Sure, some of his one liners are funny but the character is the same exact one we have seen him play in so many of his films. The screenplay really doesn't give him more to do besides to hold on to what he knows.Behind the filth and outrageousness of the story is a lesson about growing up and becoming an adult. It is a subject the film promises to make something out of but shys away from constantly. Efron's character is given scenes that seem to be the start of something. One particular scene shows him at a job fair, with all the other senior frat members, looking lost and scared all at once. It is a really deep moment that lasts, seriously, for a moment. In that one second you see so much of who Teddy is and how he has no idea what to do after he graduates. While Efron does let loose in this film quite some bit, it is this scene that really sells his ability to be a versatile actor. There are other scenes that try to come about but they are are thrown away too quickly in trade for typical frat scenes we have come to know all too well. One scene in particular with Teddy, after an existential moment, shows him threatening the couple, comes off as forced and out of touch. Who also really shines here is Dave Franco, brother of James, as a frat boy who is, unlike his president, can party with the best of them but also has a future after college ends. Franco may have more charisma than his older brother.This is, first and foremost, a frat movie and what makes this frustrating is that director Nicholas Stoller, should have been able to balance out the seriousness and over the top antics perfectly. He did it perfectly with 2008's ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", but seems to have lost his touch here. ""Neighbors"" just seems to be the run of the mill college frat party film, which many people want, but it could have embraced the themes a bit more and been something really special. A film with a great message on top of the laughs.",Neighbors
185,HollywoodJunket,Zac Efron Brings the Party to Neighbors!,9,9 May 2014,"Written by: Myles Warden for Hollywood Junket NEIGHBORS is an original comedy (which doesn't happen too often these days) written by Andrew Jay Cohen and Brendan O'Brien. The movie stars Seth Rogen as Mac Radner, a recently married man with a newborn, and Zac Efron as Teddy Sanders who is the president of the fraternity that just moved next door.Mac Radner and his wife Kelly (played by Rose Byrne) have just settled in to their newly acquired home, which that have spent ""ALL"" of their money on, with their newborn child when Teddy and his frat move next door and turn the neighborhood upside down. If you've just had a little baby girl the last thing you want her doing is growing up next door to a frat house full of partying, horny, and shirtless boys but unfortunately that is the situation Mac and Kelly have been placed in. As if sleep weren't hard enough to come by with a newborn throw in a 24 hour party next door and you can forget about ever sleeping again. After Mac's attempt at peace by befriending the frat fails Mac spends the rest of the movie trying to get the frat to move, kicked out of the neighborhood, or arrested while Teddy tries to make Mac and Kelly's life a living hell.Mac and Kelly are a textbook case of not yet ready to grow-up and embrace their thirty-something ages.   Faced with the major life-shift of raising a baby gives them a rude-awakening and strong contrast of what their lives once were by the reminder of the young college kids that moved next door.   After complaining about the noise one night, Teddy (Zach Efron) and the fraternity vice-president Pete (played by Dave Franco - yes, brother of James Franco) decide to try to win them over on their side - as they have with all of the neighbors, by inviting them into the party.  The ""old people"" (Mac and Kelly) gladly accept.   However, the very next night, the couple break a promise that they made to Teddy, and this is when an all-out war between the neighbors start.  That's where the movie gets very interesting and even cartoonishly funny during some key scenes.  You'll know which ones they are.Honestly I wasn't sure if this premise could hold up for 90 minutes without being extremely repetitive but I'm amazed at how the writers were able to pull it off using some very sound logic. I'm sure veteran director Nicholas Stoller (The Five Year Engagement, Get Him To The Greek, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, etc) aided in this as well. Every time you would say to yourself ""well why don't they just do ""this"" that's exactly what the couple would try or think and it wouldn't work. For that I take my hat off.Not to give all credit to the supporting cast, and even though Seth Rogen was the great Seth everyone loves, I must say the best performance belongs to Zac Efron in what is one of his best leading performance yet. I feel the role provided him an opportunity to show us sides of him we haven't seen (except in glimpse in Grown Ups 2) but worked as he'd been doing these type of characters for a decade. You can tell when an actor genuinely enjoys what he's doing and Zac had fun bringing the party to college and to the movie. Hopefully he'll do more comedies in this lane.Full review and more at: HollywoodJunket.com",Neighbors

The new comedy, Neighbors, takes neighborly warfare to a whole new level. Mac and Kelly have a new baby, Stella. Their lives are dominated by constantly having to take care of her. They are slowly turning into another ""old married couple"" and it is not going over so well. Other than the baby crying in the middle of the night, their lives do not contain too much noise or excitement. That changes, however, when a fraternity moves in next door. Initially Mac and Kelly attempt to be open with their new neighbors. Joining them for a party, they bond with them and we think everything is going to be OK. The president of the fraternity, Teddy, promises to keep it down, and if need be, to call him before they the cops and he'll keep everyone in check. It doesn't last long and after not being able to reach Teddy, the cops are called, and a war begins over a broken promise.This is where things start to escalate. From cans and toilet paper strewn across their yard to a hilarious sequence of stolen airbags, the war goes from mild to extreme rather quickly. I won't ruin any of the gags not seen in the trailer, because there are quite a few great moments in this movie. Seth Rogen (Mac) is essentially the same character he plays in every movie, which is not necessarily a bad thing. He is lovable and hilarious, sporting both a stoner side and a father side. His reluctance to grow up helps make him even more lovable because we can see he is trying to mature and let go of his past. His chemistry with Rose Byrne (Kelly) also fuels their relationship. They both make jokes and are a great team at fighting back against the fraternity. The fraternity is made up of Zac Efron (Teddy), Dave Franco (Pete), Christoper Mintz-Plasse (Scoonie), and many others. Teddy is basically a mirror image of Mac. He is reluctant to grow up. He is not the best student and therefore is worried about his future, but instead of fighting for it, he fights against it by throwing outrageous parties. The script is smart enough to give him a reason to do it instead of simply being an obnoxious neighbor without any motive for being obnoxious. Efron's comedic chops are outstanding and he definitely takes the spotlight and shines. The supporting cast is also great, with each of them offering up a couple hilarious moments. The movie surprisingly has a fair amount of truth. It isn't an insane party movie just for the sake of partying. It tries to justify the character's behaviors, which isn't normally seen, and for the most part it works out. Neighbors is hands-down one of the funniest movies to come out for some time now. It is full of hilarious moments and some great comedic acting. So, go check it out if you want your gut to hurt from laughing too hard.for more reviews, check out ragingfilm.com",Neighbors

Although quite outrageous at times, the film does have some unexpected additional layers of complexity which prove beneficial, adding greater depth without hurting its comedic aspects. Surprisingly enough, Rose Byrne stands out from the cast that includes such talents as Zac Efron and Seth Rogen, and her performances is undoubtedly worth praising as she displays great comedic ability. Overall, Neighbors can be described as a highly energetic film which stays true to itself and with a short running time is aware of its limitations, ultimately resulting in a funny comedy that delivers in every way and is definitely worth watching.",Neighbors

Rogen is really phoning this one in, pretty sure they were paying him in weed, and they were filming all of his parts after he came down from the high. The other problem is the screenplay was just awful. The guy knew nothing about fraternities or much of anything at all. Seemed like a screenplay based on a screenplay based on a screenplay. And I love raunchy, love it!

190,mistercsays1,Frat boys take on the suburbs.,5,8 May 2014,"There have been myriad movies made that feature the chaos and craziness of fraternity life in American universities, from Animal House to Revenge of the Nerds to the abysmal Sorority Boys or the female-centric The House Bunny, this is a genre that has never really aimed too high. The latest entry into this mostly mediocre collection of films is Bad Neighbours (released elsewhere as Neighbors), starring Seth Rogen and Australia's own Rose Byrne. Directed by Nicholas Stoller (Forgetting Sarah Marshall, The Five-Year Engagement), Bad Neighbours offers everything we have come to expect from films of this type, with the central point of difference being that that the debauchery takes place in the suburbs rather than on a university campus. Whilst the change is setting is the set-up for everything that follows, it is this shift to the suburbs that makes the entire series of events somewhat problematic.There are those who will say that the film critiques the attitudes and behaviour of young men and the failure by university administrators to address excessive drug and alcohol consumption and the mayhem that results, as well as the challenges faced by young people in making the transition into parenthood and the various responsibilities that come with it. If the filmmakers had made an effort to address these issues in a more mature way, it may have made for a more engaging experience because, ultimately, this is just another frat movie that celebrates the arrogance and excess of young men living collectively with little accountability for their actions. Rogen and Byrne are Mac and Kelly Radner, a young(ish) couple with a toddler who invest everything they have to set up home in the suburbs. However, soon after moving in, the Radner's discover that a fraternity has purchased the house next door and, from this point, the story is nothing more than a series of tit-for-tat retaliations that lead to increasingly outlandish attempts at one-upmanship. Although initially lured into the maelstrom of music and good times on offer next door, the novelty soon wears off for Mac and Kelly and, from this point, they set out to 'shut down' their neighbours; actions that only spur the frat boys into even more outlandish behaviours.In a case of art imitating life, the recently rehabbed Zac Efron plays Teddy Sanders, the fraternity President committed to nothing other than having a good time and the obligatory hazing of pledges, with all the humiliations that this entails. The fact that he maintains a chiselled physique despite his insalubrious lifestyle is impressive if utterly unlikely. It really seems as though Efron is simply playing a version of himself; relying on good looks and charm rather than any real talent to make his way in the world. For Rogen, his character and performance are very familiar to pretty much everything he has done before in that Mac is a chubby, immature and somewhat clueless 30-something with a mundane job who has somehow snared a beautiful Australian wife. It is Byrne who fares the best of the various players here, further demonstrating a flair for comedy that she honed in superior product such as Bridesmaids and I Give it a Year as well as Stoller's Get Him to the Greek. Dave Franco is conflicted as Teddy's second-in-command, while Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Ike Barinholtz and Carla Gallo occupy supporting roles that don't add too much of substance to the course of events. Lisa Kudrow also makes an appearance as a University Dean whose attitude is probably fairly accurate in its depiction of the somewhat ambivalent attitude towards the raucous behaviour of college fraternities.There is fun to be had here but the few genuine laugh-out-loud moments are tempered by many more that don't work as well. As you would expect, everything is pushed to extremes and, as is the case so often in films of this type, the police are rendered as incompetent and ineffective. Likewise, the rest of the neighbourhood are all but invisible, which seems highly unlikely given the level of chaos unleashed as the hostilities between neighbours intensifies. There seems little doubt that this film will prove popular with young men and perhaps that is all that really matters as far as turning a profit. Whilst the ending seems an attempt to deliver some kind of warning shot with regard to the consequences of partying to excess at the expense of everything else, it really is a somewhat hollow gesture that seems contrived and disingenuous given what unfolds beforehand.",Neighbors

Having also seen him in the Green Hornet (which was pretty terrible all round, so I can't pin that entirely on him) I should have realised that Seth Rogen + movie = turkey. However the preview of this didn't look too bad. Having sat through the entire movie willing it to get funnier/less puerile/find a plot it seems that the preview did in fact contain the only funny part of the whole movie.

Why Seth Rogan even gets parts in movies is beyond me. Rogan's acting (if you can call it that) is completely one note and he is disgusting to look at.Maybe bathing,shaving, a haircut and a career change would be the best thing for him.",Neighbors
194,Rage-Kage,2014 good year for comedy so far,8,4 June 2014,Neighbors is the first comedy on my list of movies to see in 2014 and so far so good. I remember when I first saw the trailer for this movie a while back I saw Zac Efron and thought... nope but I also saw Seth Rogan and thought well maybe it will be funny. I was right to think that it would be funny and I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I was wrong to think it would be bad because of Zac Efron. I don't really have a lot to say about Neighbors so I'll keep this short.There really wasn't any character in this movie that I didn't like. Everyone whether their part was big or small did a great job doing what they needed to do for the movie. Seth Rogan and Rose Byrne were a really believable couple aside from maybe how unbelievably bad parents they were. Zac Efron and Dave Franco were really good as frat boys. Both characters were really likable despite the fact that they were pretty big jerks sometimes. Watching the frat and the couple clash was just an all around fun time. I really liked how Zac Efron was not just a jerk. He was a cool guy who was really just afraid of growing up and I enjoyed seeing how he dealt with that fear throughout the movie. It was also cool how Seth Rogans character had kind of a similar problem. He was already grown up but didn't really want to be grown up. So in a way the two characters kind of grew up together.So overall Neighbors was a funny and entertaining time at the movies. I probably could of gone into greater detail but like I said I don't really feel like it. So go see the movie for yourselves and if your a fan of this kind of humor you should enjoy it the same as I did.I give Neighbors an 8/10,Neighbors

I mean, imagine if we made movies the way critics wanted their perfect movie to be? LAAME!

Plus most of the jokes are obviously improvised, like they just walked onto set that day with a rough idea of how the scene should play out and just decided to wing it, and for about every 1 joke that hits, there's about 5 that don't.I also hated the huge lapses in logic, what about the other neighbours? wont the noise coming from the fraternity irritate them as well? and why do these parents think that a discarded condom would immediately give their baby HIV? and I don't think the Dean of the university would have been so blasé about a complaint from the public.What difference did it even make to have them be a fraternity anyway?, The story would have worked just fine if it had been a group of loud, obnoxious young people.

No surprise, but in This Is The End, it was funny because that wasn't the entire film. I think if you have to be THAT immature to be ""funny"" then you aren't very funny.This movie is so damn boring and not funny. I laughed because something funny happened twice. I laughed about ten thousand times at how stupid this movie is.There isn't much else to say about this movie, because it's a comedy, and not some Transformers or Marvel movie. It's terrible.

200,blankenshipdk,Only A Rumor of Humor,2,10 February 2016,"I've always read that it's hard to get a movie made in Hollywood, especially these days, yet it somehow still manages to spew out sub par dreck like this on a consistent basis. This film actually made a lot of money which is another horrifying gauge of the cultural devolution of our society towards single celled life that will ultimately function with no brain, apparently only having a mouth to eat & eyes to watch flickering images of mediocre talents who have somehow been relegated to star status by accident or via satanic contracts. The premise of this movie is simplistic enough and continues to remain unsalvaged by any further indication of creativity as it progresses and I use that term in its chronological sense only. It's probably even dumber than the half baked idea for a movie you wrote down one afternoon on the partially used napkin you stuffed in your coat pocket after lunch except you had the good sense to realize later upon further reflection that it was as tainted as the stain left by the remnant of the salad dressing adjoining it. I laughed one time in this movie although technically it was probably more of a chortle or a snigger rather than a guffaw. Rogen's brilliant specialty appears to be jokes about naughty body parts ( penises are emphasized in this flick with boobs placing a distant second ) and pot. These concepts may in fact work if ever injected with any actual humorous aspects but no such consideration remotely exists in this script. I gave it 2 stars because any movie gets one star for simply existing although I could be tempted give it 5 stars if we could go back in time and delete it meaning that I wouldn't be subjected to viewing it in the first place and that's a potentially contradictory comedic premise that this crew could clog with dick and reefer jokes.",Neighbors
201,bloodclay,'Neighbors' is a laugh-a-minute,9,11 May 2014,"Seth Rogen is absolutely fantastic, there's no going around it. From the pot smoking goober in ""Pineapple Express"" to his eerily similar character in last year's ""This is the End"", he has a lock on raunchy comedy like no one else in Hollywood. His style and comic timing are almost impeccable and he effortlessly lights up the screen every time we see him. And though he may depart from his typical stoner role in his new film ""Neighbors"" he certainly doesn't leave behind any of the laughs. Thriving alongside a talented cast including Zac Efron and Dave Franco, he brings us some of the funniest work of his career. This new feel-good comedy follows Mac and Kelly (Rogen and Rose Byrne), a couple settling down in a quiet neighborhood with their newly born daughter when a fraternity, headed by buff college students Teddy and Pete (Efron and Franco), moves next door. Constantly throwing obnoxious parties and continually waking their baby up from the loud noise, the new parents must face-off with the brothers in an effort to get them to move. Outrageously funny and definitely deserving of its R rating, this is an experience meant to be seen on the big screen. Efron and Rogen work together perfectly, providing most of the physical gags and hilarious moments. And unlike most of the films in this genre, it doesn't just treat the leading lady as eye-candy, giving Byrne an equal driving force in the plot. Rated R for language and sexual content, ""Neighbors"" may be too foul-mouthed for some, but for me, it was a laugh-a-minute.",Neighbors
202,edgereviews,Neighbors Review,9,8 May 2014,"There are very few actors who I am guaranteed to be excited for and see any movie that they are in, no matter what that movie may be. Seth Rogen is one of those actors. He consistently stars in comedy movies that I consider to be among the best ever made, with the likes of 'Superbad', 'Pineapple Express' and last year's 'This Is The End' to name just a few. Upon hearing about 'Neighbors', I was immediately sold due to the great concept and the excellent cast that also includes the likes of Zac Efron, Dave Franco and Rose Byrne. I'm happy to say that 'Bad Neighbours' doesn't disappoint in the slightest, as it's a contender for funniest film of the year.'Neighbors' tells the story of Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly (Rose Byrne) who have a newborn baby and encounter trouble when a college fraternity moves into the house next door, led by Teddy (Zac Efron). As soon as I heard of this premise, I knew it had the potential to be very funny, and it is. The movie doesn't just rely on laughs though, at various points there wasn't any comedy but I was still engaged because the story is interesting and I wanted to see where it went next. I was also surprised that the movie had some pretty good thematic elements about growing old and the effect that it has on people.The acting is phenomenal, which is as expected from such a great cast. Seth Rogen has impeccable comedic timing as always, and I suppose you could say that he's playing the same type of character that he usually does but he does a good job doing it, so who the hell cares? Rose Byrne is also great, this was a very different role for her than what I've seen her in before (the 'Insidious' movies and 'X-Men: First Class') but she proves she can do comedy really well. Zac Efron is excellent as he always is; if you're someone who still thinks he's a bad actor because of the 'High School Musical' movies then get over yourself and accept the fact that he's one of this generation's finest young talents. For me, it was Efron and Dave Franco who stole the show, with Efron providing a lot of the laughs and Franco giving the movie some much needed humanity.Although this movie may not be as funny as, for example, last year's 'This Is The End', there are still some moments that are absolute comedic gold, including a fight scene towards the end of the movie that's absolutely incredible. Nicholas Stoller gives great direction, I was particularly impressed by the party sequences, which included amazing colour schemes and some very stylised cinematography and direction. While 'Neighbors' may not be an instant comedic classic like many other Rogen movies are, it's still incredibly funny and is a must see.",Neighbors
203,JoshuaHarryMurphy,Forgettable,5,24 June 2014,"'Bad Neighbours' is a comedy film directed by Nicholas Stoller (Forgetting Sarah Marshall / Get Him to the Greek) and written by Andrew Cohen and Brendan O'Brien. The film stars Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne as a couple who struggle to come to terms with their new parental responsibilities as a cluster of frats (Zac Efron / Dave Franco / Christopher Mintz-Plasse) moves into the house next door. Whilst the opening act of the film does register a few laughs, the one dimensional characters and narrative descension into horrifying 'Project X-ish' raving nonsense leads to a flat, laugh-less closing act. The director endeavours to grapple with issues surrounding mid-life crises and the loss of a social life following a baby, but labours to achieve this as characters rarely seem life-like and genuine. As such, it's an uphill battle to have confidence in these character's very existence, let alone engage with their difficulties. Whilst Rogen and Byrne do certainly have on screen chemistry together, rarely do their character's relationship and struggles seem anything other than fabricated and inconsequential. Zac Efron's character shares the same malnourishment of substance. His character is so cookie-cutter and one-dimensional that any questions which are raised regarding the transformation from boy to man mostly fall flat, as every action he takes seems completely ridiculous and preposterous. Therefore the attempted sensitive ending for this character fails as this emotional connection simply fails to be established. On majority, whilst the film does commendably attempt to manage these themes and transform the film into more than the superficial (Zac Efron's abs are represented as almost a driving force in the narrative), the director forlornly fails and this results in an instantly forgettable film. At least it's not too stupid.",Neighbors
204,rebeccalynnpickles,BEST COMEDY EVER,10,18 November 2018,"Laughed the whole way through. Amazing acting by Seth Rohan, Zach effron, Franco and the main girl actress. One of my favourite movies that I can watch over and over and still laugh!!",Neighbors
205,Yesh4,"A sporadically funny,shambles of a comedy",4,19 May 2014,"I was so excited to see this film ever since the trailers came out in around February. And boy was I disappointed when I went to see it. The story is about 2 new parents(Rose Byrne and Seth Rogen)who move next door to a fraternity house. The neighbours have wild,noisy parties every night and they refuse to turn it down after their neighbours' many requests. So they decide to fight back and hilarity ensues...except that it doesn't.Let me start by saying what was good about the film. Well, although it wan't the a-laugh-a-minute raunchy flick I expected it to be, it wasn't completely deprived of laughs. There were a few funny lines towards the end(the Ambercrombie and Fitch scene was really funny). Also, there was the gorgeous eye candy: a frequently shirtless Zac Efron and Dave Franco wasn't too bad either. The sound track was pretty good too.So what did I hate about it? For starters, it was unnecessarily crude and tasteless. And don't say it's because I get offended by crude humour ; ""40 year Old Virgin"",""SuperBad"" and ""American Pie"" are some of my favourite movies. But what's the difference between those and ""Bad Neighbours""? Well, in those movies although the characters are flawed and portrayed as sex-crazed, the writers show respect for the characters by making them nuanced and likable, they learn something. The characters in this flick are one-dimensional, vapid and you just don't find yourself caring about them. It was so poorly written and directed and the acting,except from Rogen's, felt phoned it. This was quite a shame because I have seen Dave Franco and Rose Bryne do great performances in their previous movies.And finally, don't make the mistake of going to see this with your parents. I did and it made for an extremely awkward viewing.",Neighbors

Still, if you're able to pass the first truly atrocious minutes (what can I say, I'm too old) set in the frat house you're in for a funny (if at times truly gross) comedy. I think all the hate the movie is getting on IMDb is the same reason I kind of appreciate it (again, I'm old): it looks like a frat comedy for a young audience, but the humor (although often crass) is more for a middle-aged audience.

But I didn't laugh or even smiled at one single thing. Seth is really starting to be more than repetitive in every part his on. Its just the same character all the time. The only one that has some kind of funny bone in this movie is Rose Byrne when she tries to be the ""cool"" person. This movie does not work. The youngster in the party house ain't funny at all and are only annoying. When the couple and the college kids party together and start to become friends its so bad that its beyond bad, I actually feel bad for the script that has to have this combination of words put together. And the actors suck and surprisingly make it even worse, and thats an achievement in itself. The inescapable conflict between the two houses could have some funny moments.

The two main characters never really did it for me and I never really wanted to root for them. 3. Those two as a couple was just downright bad casting. There was no chemistry. 4. None of the characters felt real. I don't expect every character to be well-rounded, but this was the other extreme. I thought that Zac did a good job, but again he wasn't complete, wasn't a real person. He is supposed to be this crazy unhinged frat guy, but honestly, they were way crazier than he was.

I know it's rated R but theirs some rated R movie that the themed and moral always reign but in this movie I cant help its hard to recognized those good scenes anymore because the movie was drowned by the goal of frat leader to have great party to be putted in frame and so those neighbors retaliation began.

212,edwardscissorhands12-874-850830,Neighbors,9,17 May 2014,"Seth Rogen has once again solidified that he is the number one male comedic actor in the game. Yes, all of his roles are pretty much the same, but the amount of genuine acting he brings to each role not make it only hilarious, but he finds something new to do with his characters in every role to make them funnier and funnier. The other leads of the film five phenomenal performances as well. Rose Byrne steps out of her normal type of roles to give a hilarious character good heart, and often times being the number one scene stealer of the movie. But most impressive of the leads is Zac Efron, who proves himself as comedic gold in the douchiest, most convincing role as the frat punk who sets up the story.The story is simple enough, frat vs. family. Some may say not enough effort was put into a plot like this to be able to consider it a ""good"" movie. But thing that makes this OK for Neighbors is that it knows it is a simple story and that the sole reason people are seeing it is to laugh. So, NEIGHBORS piles on laughs after laughs, almost never letting the audience catch their breath from the hilarious content. It successfully incorporates elements of pop culture to create humor, in contrast to other movies who throw it in there to make themselves look cool. By blending past media references to future, it makes the film one that anybody can go to and enjoy. I can't really say that this movie is as good as last summer's hit THIS IS THE END, but besides this one, NEIGHBORS is the funniest film in the last five years.

I got the feeling that the plot was pandering to the fraternity crowd, with the excessively long scenes of wild party stuff, irrelevant to the plot. The other type of pandering, which seems ever more important in American movies, is to SOMEHOW mention that the main actor is Jewish. God knows why this now seems to be a RULE in Hollywood - perhaps a cynical ploy to get the (often Jewish) reviewer's nod or something... but it is most usually utterly irrelevant to the story, but seems necessary ""for some reason""... financial success is my guess.... I find this really annoying. There are over a hundred completely different nationalities on the planet, why do at least 65% of the movies I see, like this one, make reference to being Jewish?Anyhow, this is a common gripe with these commercial movies.

It will probably be a classical comedy in years to come. Apart from the great cast,there is nothing special about this movie really. There is nothing that makes it better than other comedies.

Secondly, being an English graduate it's hard to imagine what level of fratboys culture (part of the films content) is actually true. I only hope that at least a percentage is true - and all these young American do have that much fun.Thirdly, I didn't hate it, BUT I made sure from the start I didn't take the film to seriously, and I found it fairly funny. In the main Seth Rogen (Mac Radner) and Rose Byrne (Rose Byrne) did a goodjob at being the cute in love couple (in general you wanted them to win). The humour was on point - but obvious. Just before posting this I saw on IMDb lots of negative words - I have no idea why people are complaining about the content. When the saw SETH ROGEN did they think it he going to singing hymns and stuff???? Although on the one point I do wonder now what the hell you have to do to get an 18 certificate in 2014 - the film completely simplified the issue of drug as a teen age years and pushes quite a few boundaries. What do you have to do to be an 18???? Casting did well recruiting the world's cutest and best behaved baby of all time.

Instead I wound up wasting my time sitting through something that most definitely was not funny. Actually, the funniest thing that happened during the movie is that the popcorn machine in the concession stand at the theater I was at (Franklin Square, NY) malfunctioned and starting burning the popcorn, which set the fire alarm off and stopped the picture dead for 20 minutes (no, I am not making this up). This happened 10 minutes into the picture and little did I know at the time that it was a reprieve rather than an interruption.

I went with my eyes fully open, expecting a tasteless, crass assault on the senses, and I was in the mood for exactly that. Sometimes those kinds of movies are just what you want even if you come out after feeling like you should scrub yourself vigorously with bleach-soaked sandpaper and say a million hail mary's.And this film delivers... half the package. It is crass and unnecessarily rude, chucking in a few c-words for shock value, a few boobs to keep the spotty teenagers (and spotty adults) happy, a bit of violence etc etc. But WHERE WERE THE FRIGGING LAUGHS? I chuckled about 3 times, and one of them was because I heard my mate laugh and assumed I had missed a joke (he was in fact, quite understandably, attempting to suffocate himself by ramming his head into his Pick N Mix).There were a couple of promising moments in the opening scenes which I can't even remember now. If I had known that they were to be the only laughs in the entire film I would have made more of an effort to record them. As it was I blithely assumed that there would be more to come. In retrospect I blush at my naivety.Millions of my brain cells short-circuited themselves just so that this utter toilet-juice could not be transmitted into my head. If you suffer from seizures/are prone to heart problems/or are at risk from having a stroke... do not worry, you are more likely to die from boredom/suicide as you watch this brain hemorrhage of a film.Everything about it is annoying - the actors are annoying, the script is annoying, the product placement is annoying, the music, the plot (hahaha), the pacing, the *stupid* *unfunny* 'hilarious' to-and-fro's between Seth Rogen and Rosie Byrne, the sickly Hollywood moralising ... all *annoying*, and worse still sometimes just plain dull. How do you make a film of this genre *dull*, I mean at very least you expect it will tick along at a reasonable pace; even if it is depressingly badly done surely the loud noises and flashing lights will stimulate some part of your brain, yes? You would think so because you are a rational human being and someone has placed a product in front of your eyes that cost millions of dollars to produce; something that took months of writing, planning, acting (cough), editing, all done by *professional* film makers working for a major Hollywood film production company. But no. I have sat through more exciting and rewarding bowel-movements (by a huge margin, but then perhaps that's setting the bar a little high). You probably get the idea: I didn't like it.I know I mentioned the 'comedy' 'back and forths' between Rogen and Byrne, but I feel it is necessary to clearly state that you will feel physically sick during these. They have attempted to make these exchanges appear spontaneous, as if the comic tension between the two of them was crackling and sparkling with such fury that the director just said 'hey you guys, you don't need a script, you don't need me, hell you just stand there and vomit me comedy gold'. Well they vomited... right over your clothes and in your hair and in your eyes.

I'm not a huge fan of this Judd Apatow/raunchy style, but some I do like, King Of Staten Island, Superbad or TED for examples. I feel like this film just really tries to be dirty and vulgar but it doesn't work. Positives I found with the film were the talented cast, who were good being as they had a pretty bad script. I still laughed a bit at times. The only reason it's 4 stars is because I laughed out loud a couple of times near the start, and I really thought the movie would keep this going, but it didn't. But oh well a laugh is a laugh so I have to give the credit. I'll have to admit when I went on the review page and saw all the one star reviews I was shocked. But it goes to show that Seth really needs to put that wit he used in Superbad again, not just throw in some random disgusting stuff and think people will always laugh their asses off at it. I won't criticize it's fairly simple plot, because comedies aren't known for complicated stories, it's more about their executions. And this executed quite poorly.

It's really not that bad of a movie, it's very entertaining and Rogen and Byrne's performances are both great for what they are. People on IMDb have given this movie really horrible reviews, as a matter of fact I scrolled through the reviews and couldn't find anything above a 3/10. That's just wrong. Neighbors is not supposed to be Citizen Kane for crying out loud. It's a silly frat comedy and should be taken as such. I saw one reviewer complaining about the municipal guidelines that the frat refuse to acknowledge. What?? It's a fine movie that WILL make you laugh at least once or twice, if not throughout depending on your sense of humor. It will entertain you for it's whole runtime. The movie isn't trying to win any Oscars, so on that note some technical aspects of the film. It's edited in an interesting way at points that I found myself really enjoying. The cinematography is never upsetting which means that it's not shot by Roger Deakins but it never once really made me gag or anything (another thing reviewers have said). Stoller directed this movie in a really interesting way as well, and again I think the movie would be a lot worse without his direction, but again it's by no means directed by Hitchcock nor is it trying to look like it. All of the performances are great, if not entertainingly and appropriately slightly over acted. My point is, see this movie as a silly frat movie. Don't expect it to make you belly laugh from minute one to minute 95. Let it entertain you. It's a good movie that I'm never upset by re watching. DON'T LISTEN TO THE HATE!!!!!! 7/10",Neighbors
235,blagomeni,A&F commercial at its best,5,26 May 2014,"I like to follow careers of young actors and predict the paths they may take. It is mostly lots of fun and when I prove right, I derive pleasure form the fact which, to be honest, does not help much in my everyday life. Bad Neighbors is a comedy based on a simple story about new neighbors and gradual deterioration of their fragile relationship. A couple with a baby wakes up one morning only to find out that a fraternity is moving in to the house next door. We are conditioned by the American movies not to expect anything good from those ridiculous fraternities of theirs and this story does not fail to deliver in that respect. An exhausted housewife with a small baby and an office worker living a nine to five life have very little in common with rowdy students who mostly make parties and think of the noisy ways to dull the urges of their highly hormonal post teen lives. This is the corner stone of the story in this movie. Starting as a relationship based on mutual understanding and respect, the situation rapidly deteriorates into a war between incompatible neighbors. The means for achieving their respective goals become more and more dangerous and destructive. There are occasional scenes in this movie which may fall into the category of funny. Overall, there are not too many of them. Mostly, this movie serves as a promotional ad for young Zac Afron and his meticulously developed and groomed physique. In my opinion, he had nothing more to offer than that. One of the last scenes in the movie shows him as an Abercrombie & Fitch model working as a front door eye candy at one of their stores. If he continues to take parts that mostly rely on his good looks instead of his acting capabilities, I worry he may end up as a real A&F model. Do not get me wrong. I have nothing against those fine young men and women of A&F. They must have worked very hard to get where they are now. This movie is one of those that you watch when you want to relax and forget about the hardships of your everyday life. In that respect, it is a movie that delivers.

Identifying with them became impossible.It quickly devolved into a string of tired comedy stereotypes and clichés, and I do not blame the actors. They did what they could with this lame script.I suspect that this well has been drawn from too many times.

Actually it was a Redbox rental, about $0.99 overpriced.I'm more of a horror, sci-fi, fantasy movie buff but every once in a while I indulge in a comedy.

I'm sorry, but this movie is the manifestation of everything that's wrong with comedy and why I often shun the genre.The sense of humor here is Half Baked (1998) meets the vulgarity of South Park; but without the clever satire or commentary of a social issue. Bad neighbors... yes, we've all had them, but none of us can relate to how Mac and Kelly deal with them in the movie which makes it so boring.Seth Rogen basically plays himself. Rose Byrne plays herself. They inject themselves into a series of SNL skits too risky for TV, and BOOM... there's your movie.

I chuckled away merrily for the whole thing. The problem is that I was laughing more at the uneven, three-wheeled bizarreness of the whole movie than at any of the jokes.""Neighbors"" was written by Andrew J Cohen and Brendan O'Brien, two of the unsung heroes of the Judd Apatow comedy universe (Knocked Up, The 40 Year Old Virgin etc) and they've even managed to bag Apatow regular Seth Rogen as a lead. Their style is as tangible as gravity. You get plenty of regular, Joe Schmo characters and pop culture references that do, somewhat, keep the film anchored in the real world.Unfortunately, every other aspect of the screenplay seems to be trying to tear the movie out of reality and into some kind of Harold and Kumar or Looney Tunes universe. The basic plot of the movie is that an ordinary couple, Mac and Kelly (Seth Rogen and the miscast Rose Byrne) have their lives turned upside down when a rowdy frat house, headed by ""The Teddy"" (Zac Efron) move in next door. Straight up, in reality this would break so many zoning laws that it would be easier for the frat boys to set up a toxic waste refinery next to a nursery.We are also quickly and with very little reason expected to buy 100% into the idea that, based on one contested noise complaint, the cops will no longer help or even listen to Mac and Kelly as the parties next door continue night and day. Right away, this shatters any real audience connection with what's going on. What made similar movies like Knocked Up great was that the characters felt like real people with real problems. It lets the audience connect to what's going on on a deeper level than just recognising that the humanoids on the screen have the same number of limbs and digits as themselves, and even speak a comparable language.The plot develops along fairly routine feuding-neighbor lines, with each exchange taking it further and further. The screenplay can't seem to decide who is right and who is wrong, and in a movie as cartoonish as this, you really need a clear bad guy. They humanise the Zac Efron character by having a psychology undergrad explain to him that he's afraid of the future and it taking it out on this out-of-shape slob next door who may well represent himself a few years down the line, but ultimately this plot strand doesn't pay off or feed into a big resolution.In fact, there's no real resolution. The movie just sort of stops, with the frat boys busted after the couple sabotage their big party. Why The Teddy doesn't retaliate in a major way after this is never explained, which makes no sense given the escalating-antics format of the previous events. He just sort of gives up for no reason.I had a lot of problems with the Zac Efron's performance. I'm aware that in Hollywood it is sometimes necessary to cast people who are clearly in their thirties as college undergrads, but it can work, as long as they act the part. At no point does Efron seem even remotely recognisable as anyone who could really exist. He's too cool, calm, collected, and confident to be what the part really requires - a certain little-boy-lost, overcompensating vulnerability.Female characters in Judd Apatow-esque movies tend to be histrionic shrews, and unfortunately the Kelly character has even more of a buzzkilling load to bear, as the responsible mother to Mac's clownish father. Rose Byrne tries her best to inject some carefree, twentysomething fun into the character, but the filmmakers's utter inability to create or handle female characters really slays this dead. It also doesn't help that she looks uneasy and detached around a baby, like she's waiting for the offscreen handlers to come in and do something with this awkward screaming lump. There's also the fact that looks like she still has a reasonable shot as being a model. All the other females are slutty, disposable party girls, or brain dead, self absorbed bureaucrats. It strongly seems that Hollywood is still telling women their only true role is to be a wife and mother.Complaints aside, the script throws lots of absurd jokes our way and I did find myself laughing quite a lot. I really didn't know what was going to happen next or where the film was going. One criticism you could certainly not apply is predictability.I also have to give the movie a few points for creating some of the best on screen parties since Project X. It really felt like you were there. The UV party was especially well done. I'm not even envious that I didn't go to one party as remotely cool as this during my entire time at university.

My hopes went down a little when the opening scene is Mac (Seth Rogen) and Kelly (Rose Byrne) trying to have sex but can't get their daughter to stop looking at them. And then it was one joke after another about how neither of them came, which was just really awkward. But it got better. Kind of.There's some laughable moments (that weren't already in the trailers) and I thought Rose Byrne did a good job, I had her in my mind as the mom from Insidious so I was weary on whether she'd be funny or not, but she wasn't bad. There are a few things that kind of ruined the movie for me and things that just don't make sense, like the party at the end with copious amounts of weed. One thing that's brought up in the movie and actually used against the frat house is the fact that they're broke and have no money, so where they got money to get pounds and pounds of weed, who knows. They literally take handfuls and throw it into burning barrels. And something that kind of ruined the whole movie for me was when Scoonie (aka McLovin from superbad) is, like, dancing/hopping away from Ike Barinholtz (jimmy) and he says ""yolo"" in a melodious manner. Out of all of the things they could have refrained from using it could have been that stupid term, but of course they had to stick it in there.But, it is a college based movie, and with that comes sex and cum jokes,everything centered around partying and beer, and overuse of the ""F"" word. I read in another review that it would have been funnier if they would have made the parents actually responsible grown-ups, and I completely agree. They party just as hard as the college kids and they're insanely irresponsible and childish, which makes the whole premise of the movie kind of hard to believe. Overall it's not the worst.

I feel like the reviews are just a bunch of parents in their 30s to mid 40s that thought the movie was about acting more mature and to not have fun. No, the message was that being a parent doesn't have to keep you from having fun from time to time, but always be sure it's at the right time. They became cool with each other in the end, if you just watched it and didn't leave the theater immediately, and ran home to write a review. And a bunch of other people said that the movie was ""vulgar and brainless"", which shows me enough that people don't into movies as much as they should, in fact, I don't think people look into these kinds of movies at all. Yes, I understand that this movie has a lot of drug use and profanity, and there is a good amount of crude humor with sexual content and graphic nudity, but that doesn't really make the movie completely vulgar. This movie had a lot behind that adults need to understand. Plus, not to mention, it was a movie about frat boys living next door, were you expecting this movie's humor to be pleasant? I honestly thought this movie was fairly funny, especially the airbag scenes, and even if it wasn't, I'd still enjoy it, because it lets you know that you can still have fun from time to time, and nothing will keep you from doing that for a long time. You have to look into a movie more before you review it.",Neighbors

Just watched it on tv and it was so bad , so unfunny , and so immature even my husband, who is a fraternity alumni fell asleep. He said none of that happens with the frats except partying... I wish I could give this negative stars for how simple minded and non-clever any of the ""jokes"" are and how degrating the movie is to.women..are you serious hollywood and rose byrne? What a waste of time. NONE of the characters are likable NONE of the acting is good & NONE of the movie made any sense.
Why didn't the neighbors put up a fence and trees ? Instead they pay a kid 1000k to wear spy glasses? Laughable. Why do the parents have no common sense about their baby or life in general yet they were going to take a baby to a rave? How.is that funny? And the baby watching them have sex? Unrelatable. Why didnt the mother understand breastfeeding after her baby is like 9 months.. By 2 months all mothers know what they are doing... Immature men in Hollywood directing this pathetic film...

252,thephaseshift,Bad taste is being continually redefined...,3,22 August 2014,"I like to watch these kinds of movies to pass the time now and then...but they're not always this bad.It's like an 11-year old boy got a huge budget and was allowed to make a movie, basically.One scene in particular is more than an eye-roller, it's so bad-taste it defies description. Yeah - the milking scene. My pregnant wife was sitting next to me and we could both only shake our heads in disbelief. Yeah I know - not everyone has a pregnant wife, or is pregnant. Still, it's pretty bad.I guess the most disappointing thing in the end was that the main actress - Rose Byrne - seems too smart to be in this role. She acts stupid in the movie, and it doesn't feel right. It looks like she's dumbing herself down to the level of her hubbie. Maybe it's the Australian accent which is all too easy to confuse with a stereotypical ""smart English"" one, but still, she doesn't fit. Add to that various tired stereotypes and frankly boring dialog, and you have a real winner of a movie. To be honest I'm really surprised at the relatively high meta-grade it got at metacritic. Go figure.But hey, this is just my opinion, and I'm not an 11-year old kid. If you are, maybe you'll love it. But I hope not - I have higher hopes for 11 year olds than this.

It will remind you of Jackass because you will see graphic nudity (sexual intercourse between a man and a woman,a man was forced to suck a dildo,people reveal their butts and throw fire works by means of their butts). Honestly,I did not find this movie worth watching at all,because it lacks 90 % of comedy and it tries to tempt the audience to see it through cheesy and explicit sex.

259,collantesj,Worst movie ever!,1,8 July 2014,"I went to see this movie with my teenagers hoping to have a good laugh. You had Seth and Zach in it. Boy was I wrong!First the plot: Two new parents who think they are still young and hip, have a fraternity move in next door. They set some limits, break the limits, do not call the police and have the Fraternity screw their lives up, until they come up with a totally illegal way to screw the fraternity up. Sounds innocent enough right? In between you have sex, more sex, bad sex, immorality, women portrayed as stupid or nymphomaniacs, brain-dead kids, stupid police, woman being abused or coaxed, women being degraded, men being degraded, etc. etc. etc.Huge problem, the writers could not make a single joke that did not involve sex, porn, nudity or some variation or combination of these two, basically brain dead. The characters are not real, when will writers realize we know when a character is just doing things because there is no way anybody in real life would do the same thing. It insults your brain.One more problem, if you respect women, love your children and believe that violence and sexism should not be promoted in movies, this is not for you. A penis around someone's neck is NOT comedy, its gross.Finally, this film confirms that some actors will do anything for money. Zach and Seth were on a great path of making great movies, it seems they either smoked or drank their last paycheck and needed some more money and did this. This will definitely stir me away from future films they make.I miss this type of comedies that actually relied on good writing and stories. Now it's all shock therapy, even my oldest son thought it was too much and felt robbed of time and money. We are not too religious or prudes but this was in another dimension,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY IF YOU HAVE SOME MORALITY IN YOU, YOU WILL FEEL FILTHY AFTER WATCHING THE MOVIE.I am sure a lot of misguided teenagers without a moral ground will find it hilarious and that is to me the biggest problem, if Hollywood made it, it's because there is an audience, let's hope it's small.",Neighbors

Seth Rogan and Rose Byrne give a great performance as the parents and i was very convinced that they were actually parents and Dave France had a pretty good performance as the 'smart guy' in the film but the star of this movie is Zac Efron giving the best performance i have ever seen by him!. The film is very cleverly written and will keep you intrigued until the end with the great references and intelligent dialogue. Each scene is very well placed out whether it be and in the office or inside the homes of the characters everything seems very well placed and perfect, the parties are realistic and have meaning throughout the film, with the crazy soundtrack and lighting that will make you feel like your actually there this film is a roller coaster ride from start to finish. The film isn't outrageously funny but their is some funny moments throughout, don't get me wrong the film is great but it isn't as great as last years 'This Is The End'. Although this film is lacking in comedy for a comedy it is a really fun and an entertaining movie to watch, and i would highly recommend you take some friends to see this movie as it can be very relatable to yourself and others. This movie isn't for the people that dislike or despise nudity and or coarse language because there is are lot of it in this film.

The jokes were not funny and predictable and it was a waste of opportunities. The most fun I had was, spotting the cameo appearances of other funny actors.The weirdest thing was, Zack Efron's character seemed to be incoherent. That has left a lot of room for development. In the beginning he was rather shy and seemed like a sensitive boy. At some point, I thought the movie would explain that his loud parties are just cover ups for his internal flaws, and that maybe a deep friendship was going to develop between him and his neighbor. That was never fully explained in the movie and his character was very one directional.On the other hand, Zack was the hottest thing in the movie. His shirtless shots are as usual, priceless. Other than that, this movie has not much redeemable value.",Neighbors
264,breytie,A film about the noble man,10,24 July 2014,"It is not realistic to think students in the USA have the kind of money to spend on parties like we see in this film. So it has to be a metaphor. To my mind the parties represent modern daily life in the city. It mainly consists of noise, but also sex, drinking and eating.Amongst all the noise, sex etcetera there has to be small pieces of truth and also some lasting principles. The two men Teddy, a student, and Mac, a young father, become neighbours somewhere in suburbia. While all the noise and stuff are going on, it appears that one of them stands by his convictions of honesty, loyalty and male bonding. The other does't mind backstabbing, corrupting and waging a personal vendetta with the help of the shallow life of noise, sex and drinking.The final conclusion is very interesting. Just like in real life, the one who pursues the higher values, ends up betrayed by people who gave lip service to those values and he goes on alone, but probably not lonely. The other neighbour is more acceptable and ""good for business"". So he keeps on as ""the more attainable goal"" to be followed by the masses.Who is the bad neighbour?",Neighbors

He's always the vulgar, lazy drug using average Joe. Not funny, not cool, not sad, not dramatic, not relevant. His last funny scene is years in the past.The rest of the film is just as irrelevant.

266,viktor-hammarberg,Why all the hate? Since when is vulgarity cause for negative reviews?,10,5 July 2014,"Okay, first of all I'd like to state that I rarely review films because I tend to think IMDb does a great job giving people a general picture of how good/bad a movie is, and the mixed reviews tend to allow for a pretty balanced perspective. But what the f-bombing f-bomb is going on here?I went through pretty much 5 pages of 1/10 reviews of this film and then I just exploded with frustration. I had to interrupt this copycat streak. It goes to show that it's in peoples nature follow the herd and if they see enough negativity they'll convince themselves that's how it is. This movie is obviously not targeted at the old people writing these reviews, nor the young people following their lead to appear ""intelligent"" or whatever they're trying to achieve. Since when is multiple usage of the f-bomb a plausible reason to dislike a movie? I am in complete shock.I watched this movie sober, late at night, by myself and I laughed out loud a multitude of times and I rarely laugh when I watch comedies alone even if I find them funny.The dialogue was f-bombing hilarious, witty and extremely clever. The much used f-word adds authenticity and flavor in an comically exaggerated scenario. I personally use the word (almost) equally much in casual conversations with my friends. Obviously things are exaggerated though, otherwise you'd be making a documentary.Based on all these negative reviews, I guess you could say that many fail to realize and appreciate when things are intentionally lame and intensionally exaggerated to the point when it almost doesn't make sense, but since it is intentional it in fact does make sense. The movie makes use of a lot of satirical elements and is in a sense is making fun of people who doesn't get this type of humor. I, for one, love Seth Rogen and personally think this is one of his best. ""The Hangover"" which is praised by so many people for example, I re-watched it the other day and holy s-bomb is that humor outdated. I did not even smile. Zach is good, but unfortunately it's been used to the point where I want to vomit. THAT is a stupid movie, this movie is actually made by someone who's so intelligent most people don't even get it and render it stupid and immature. Humour is evolving as quickly as technology, and like 9GAG, if you're not active or within that atmosphere many of the jokes will be almost impossible to grasp or seem extremely lame, but lame is the game. This (in my opinion) is a very small piece of the dawn of a new era of humor. If I could define this movie I would call it a comically exaggerated satire of both early marriage, frat life and friendship. The message is there, but I guess a lot of people get scared off by the constant swearing and profanity to look past it and not take it so f-bombing serious.I loved this movie and it scares me to see that the average reviewer is on an intensely different page, and has failed to take the movie for what it is. I'm with the critics on this one.10/10",Neighbors

I was, however, slightly disappointed. Seth Rogen however steals the show along with his wife/sidekick Rose Byrne, who offers up another incredibly comedic performance after Bridesmaids. It's when we get to Zac Efron that I think this film has faults, I don't believe that he's funny, but rather the material wrote for him is. His performance is wooden and rehearsed, unlike the naturalistic comedy we get from the likes of his peer Dave Franco, whose performance is great and one of my favourite things in this other wisely let down of a film.

The movie was hilarious. Yes, it was over the top, a bit raunchy and crude, but the interaction between Seth Rogen and Zac Efron's characters was priceless. I could completely empathize with Seth character and his wife. You can see the new parent haze that they are going through while at the same time you can see how living next to Zac Enfron and the rest of the tenants would make you lose it.In the end, while the movie is over the top, it was also a ton of fun.

The idea was pretty good, the jokes were funny and the actors were cool (still talking about the trailer). I do consider myself a mild Seth Rogen fan; he's rather funny and sympathetic but that's besides the point. When this movie started, I was immediately thrown off by how boring it was; where was the funny stuff from the trailer? By the end, nothing really changed - it was predictable, very Project-X like and, to be honest, not that funny. I did not hate it, I think the actors did as best as they could to give the cheesy script some credibility but weren't able to. In the end, the bromance jokes were overdone and the jokes either stayed in the trailer or never made it into the movie. To me, it was boring. I kept thinking when it was going to end, so I can go watch Game of Thrones and it's usually not a good sign when I think about watching something else instead. However, I'm giving it a 6/10 for the ending. I did enjoy that - finally, a party-movie with repercussions and (little) consequences. It was alright, I guess, but I wouldn't watch it again.

I like Seth Rogen's humor in other movies like Superbad, This is the End, and 50/50 as well as some others. When I finally saw this movie, I was left with major disappointment. It wasn't as funny as I had expected. The trailer is hilarious and the movie isn't. All the good jokes were spoiled in the trailer. All the other jokes that weren't spoiled are forgettable or not funny at all. Other times, this movie takes it's raunchy jokes and pushes them to the extreme almost along the lines of the jokes in ""Brüno"".The characters in the movie aren't the best written ones and in the end it comes down to the actors. This movie was well acted for the most part. Seth Rogen did a good enough job with what he was given. Zac Efron was actually better than I had expected. Then we have other actors like Dave Franco and Christopher Mintz-Plasse. I like both Dave and Chris but they weren't given much to make them unique. What I'm saying is that they could have been replaced by any other actors. Dave was annoying at times and Chris didn't really have any good jokes like he did in Superbad and Kick-Ass.Overall, this movie isn't really worth watching, even if you like Seth Rogen.

I tallied 2- 3/10 from the several pages I read. Its average ranking rates above many of what one could call the seminal and decent movies you've seen over your viewing lifetime.

I enjoyed Rose Byrne and thought she was probably one of the funniest characters in the movie which was a shock. Zac Efron played well and Dave Franco didn't really do anything great, except his scene with Jinxy. I thought some actors weren't needed and that their jokes were so dumb that even dumb and dumber wouldn't laugh. I found McLovin (he will always be McLovin) not funny at all and not needed. His acting was awful, just as in Role Models.

This movie had the chance to be very funny if they had of concentrated more on the comedy and less on rude, crass scenes with little or no meaning. The concept was appealing that's why I went to see it however, the director, actors, script writers virtually everyone involved let this movie down big time. Its such a shame to see some decent actors/actresses involved in a movie of this calibre. Basically I am sorry I wasted a cent paying for a ticket for this movie, I wouldn't even hire it on DVD don''t waste your time, it isn't worth watching.",Neighbors

I can't believe any parents would be as irresponsible as the leads were. What local police, or for that matter, what neighborhood, would tolerate all the noise without complaint? This could've and should've been done so much better. I don't usually go for Seth rogan films and this is a good example why. Not very funny, poorly written. How this is rated 6.4 is beyond me.

But even at that, I felt it was a sheer waste of my money and time. The movie was one-joke endless take on a frat house moving next door to a married-with-child couple. The jokes were sophomoric, boring, and grasping to be funny. Watching the trailer just showcases the whole idea. Sitting there for 90+ minutes to watch this repetitive magma of crude comedy does not bring laughs. Add nudity, simulated sex, urinating, hazing, same-sex kissing, dildos,stale Seth Rogen shtick with his endless trying-to-be-so-cool and you have a feeble attempt of a movie with actors and extras vying to see who can be absolutely gross.Parents leaving a baby home alone all night to get wasted is sheer irresponsibility along with having said baby chew on a condom seems like some kinda crazy abuse.

I think people are expecting a little bit too much from this film, sure it's not a ""masterpiece"" but it's not bad either.If you just want to watch a movie just because, then you should consider watching it. But if you want to watch something for your own entertainment, then this film is probably not your best choice.So, I believe that you should rent this movie and if you like it, then by all means, you should buy it, but in my personal opinion, I would recommend seeing this movie more than one time.",Neighbors

Pretty much every time they were doing something stupid, it wasn't even funny, but the spectators in the theater were laughing. In resume, it's about adults with newborn trying to get drunk, high and feel young again. And when the thing goes wrong, they started a war with their neighbors.

So I switched off the brain, warmed up the cheek bones in preparation for some rib-ticklers, but sadly they were few and far between. Seth Rogan and Rose Byrne star as young parents forging a life together with their infant child. Their peaceful suburban lives are turned upside down when a college fraternity, lead by Zac Efron and Dave Franco, move in next door. What ensues is a cat-and-mouse game between the warring neighbours involving childish pranks.Seth is a funny man. His crass, dim-witted, improvisational-self does attract chuckles in a few scenes but the emphasis is on FEW. The trailer sadly contains all the jokes so the rest of the movie is just padding. Also the chemistry between Rose and Seth seems off. Seth would have approached this role very casually, which for him comes naturally, Rose is very stiff and scripted. Zac and Dave try hard and do an OK job. There are a few amateur acting scenes such as when Zac and Seth are impersonating the batman of their generation. Zac's facial expressions are weird. This movie is being rubbish by other critics and I can understand why but by now you should expect the juvenile dick jokes when lead actor is Seth Rogan is involved. This is nowhere near being a masterpiece but for the 17-25yo age group there enough in there to ensure a laugh or two with your mates. Plus the girls (and maybe some guys) will enjoy a shirtless prancing Efron. Everyone else just needs to lighten up and enjoy the jokes as they come up.",Neighbors

It was neither of those things, I was thoroughly impressed. Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne characters made an excellent couple showing there conflicted yet loving relationship, while experiencing problems with there new neighbors Zac Efron and Dave Franco along with many others. There is great chemistry between Zac and Seth and some of the things they do left me in stitches. The film made good use of pop culture references for laughs and shows fair amount of immaturity through Cannabis jokes, nudity etc. This is a a movie that can touch upon the younger generations as well as the older.

One of the more interesting scenes involves the couple crossing the street to meet the frat boys. The conversation is witty, albeit awkward at times. It is dialogues such as these that makes a film memorable but regrettably, such dialogues are few and most of the film's conversation are filled with childish overtures and over-the-top pranks played by one against another.Seth Rogen wasn't in top form in this film, when one compares his remarkable acting in ""Knocked Up"" or ""SuperBad"". However, his on screen chemistry with actress Rose Byrne is great.Zac Efron uses his looks to great effects here as one of the lead characters within the frat team, and he was one of the better additions to the cast in this film.The story premise is rather simple, and more intricate plots can be added for a more interesting plot line for this film.It's an OK film for a watch but don't expect much from the conversations or the story itself.

That's about it.Essentially, this movie's humor comes from mediocre slapstick within it, even though it puts effort into a plot that ends up being very basic, and overall -- it's not great.There's nothing original besides a few periodic zingers expressed. You won't be laughing out loud, but will be smirking periodically, along with a possible chuckle or two throughout.Overall, in my book, it gets a C. Given the basic premise that the movie resides on, the only real room they had to make it a Good or Great movie would to have had given it more complexity with running sub-plots coming together at the end (which good humor movies do).This one failed at that.

This movie was awful and that's sad because I really wanted to like it. I like Seth Rogen and Zach Effron but this just...sucked.First off this should have been rated NC-17. It seemed every 5 minutes someone was having sex. The scenes are supposed to be humorous but it was just awkward and unnecessary. I think the only part of the movie where I did laugh was the flash back part when they showed the guys from Workaholics as past members of the fraternity. Too bad that was only 10 seconds of the whole movie. My boyfriend didn't laugh the entire time and actually fell asleep. I watched it all the way through hoping it would revive itself and instead it slowly withered and died.

318,WednesdaySPN,Depressingly Bad,1,20 November 2014,"*** This review may contain spoilers *** The film is the worst film I have ever seen. It enraged me and then deeply saddened me. Amid the pervasive ""Drugs and Alcohol are Cool"" teeny bop-per mentality that is catastrophically contrived and boring, there are racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic ""jokes"" that are 'so done'. Ridiculous sexual myths are once again being trudged out to yet another generation who might buy into them. Myths such as the penis size being of all importance, dildo's somehow being treasures to women, vagina's being stretched, Women having orgasms by simply hopping on and off, etc. ad nausea, all of which perpetuate an immature and misogynistic perspective of human sexuality. Any adult watching the film would be bored, if not insulted.The worst quality of the movie is that the viewer is also made to suffer through the complete degradation of women and their bodies. Stella, a nursing mother, seems inexplicably unaware that her breast milk is affected by alcohol; fortunately, her clever husband knows that she should not breast feed the baby with her alcohol laced milk. Honestly, every nursing mother in the world knows this. The remedy is to pump the breast milk off but of course, klutz husband steps on the pump and they have no backup. Another unconvincing set up. Curiously, she is incapable of relieving herself and must get her husband to do it. If this seems contrived, it is. It takes 3.5 minutes to set this scenario up and another 2 minutes to execute a bunch of one-liners: "" Oh, gross. They're hulking out. They look like my grandmother's legs."" (This in reference to her swollen breasts)""Get on your hands and knees. We need a pail or something."" ""I got like four pails out of you.""""We should go mom tipping later."" ""Just trying to lighten the mooed. Mooed. That was udder lee traumatic. How much of you was traumatized 2%? 1%?"" Five minutes devoted to degrading and equating women to cows. That's 19.2 percent of the movie. This segment appears exactly half way into the film. The climax. And why? To delineate the whole point of the film: Let's see how we can take something as beautiful, natural and essentially, sacredly feminine as breastfeeding and portray it in the most disgusting and degrading way we possibly can. How could any young woman after watching this possibly feel good about her body and look forward to nurturing a child? How will she be able to nurse a child without these horrible insults haunting her? Do we really need to teach a new generation of young men to degrade women and their bodies and regard women as disgusting cows? The writers, Andrew J. Cohen, and Brendan O'Brien should feel nothing but shame for themselves. There are millions of writers who could probably write a better screenplay in 24 hours than this pair could in their life times. Shame on the producers, Evan Goldberg Seth Rogen, and James Weaver who backed and promoted this film. Shame on Hollywood for allowing these people to require artists to prostitute themselves in such a rank cesspool.Probably the most poignant recurring comment in previous I.M.D.B. comments is not the number of adults who left during the film but the dead silence during and after the film for those who slogged it out. The silence. The silence of an audience who has matured and recognizes Hollywood for what it has been; immature and misogynistic. Humanity deserves better. Can't we move on?",Neighbors

I walked out about 1/3 of the way through it as it was too difficult to watch. I would recommend NOT seeing this film as I think it is about the worst film I ever saw in my life. The writing struck me as infantile writing in that it didn't always make sense and was unrealistic. There was a lot of vulgarity which didn't make me laugh or strike me as being necessary or original. I thought it was targeted for the IQ level of about 75...anyone with a brain would not go for it. How can anyone make a film this BAD?? Save your money and don't even think of seeing this one. I can't believe that it has any good reviews? Also, what is wrong with rotten tomatoes? I went to see if based on their review. What a mistake for me! I agree with one of the reviewers here....see ""Revenge of the Nerds"" instead....that was a good film.

My mistake for glancing at the numerical values on the Google search rather delving into the literature posted by other moviegoers. Never have I heard so many instances of the F-word, which incidentally seems to have a growing trend in mainstream cinema. It simply goes to show how much American morality has slid precipitously, especially within the past ten years. I don't see how anybody, especially the 'professional' critics could rate this piece of trash. The storyline is thin at best and as mentioned before, the language deplorable. In fact, the longer I sat in the theater, I could literally feel my IQ dropping. As mentioned by another commenter, the MPAA should have rated 'Neighbors' as NC-17.

Zac Effron played really well alongside Rogen, and most of this movie was hilarious. Also, the fraternity aspect was quite accurate (I'm currently a college student with friends in a fraternity). This movie went over the top to get laughs, which is exactly what everyone who thought about the cast of this movie for a second imagined it would do.I thought Neighbors added a nice spin on typical fraternity movies, and watching Rogen try to act like a responsible adult was entertaining as hell.

328,mscubman,The baby was the funniest actor,2,23 May 2014,"This one was pretty brutal. I love the raunch comedy (Old School, Step Brothers, Knocked Up, 40 Year Old Virgin, Dewey Cox) but this one forgot the comedy side of things.There were a couple chuckles at the beginning, but that ended about 15 minutes in. I've liked Rose in a couple things, enjoyed Bridesmaids, but all the scenes with just her and Rogen seemed forced. The sex scenes were brutal. They may have been stereotypical but poorly executed. She's good as a supporting but she has to have a strong lead.Which brings us to Rogen. Looking back on movies I've liked him in, he's had pretty strong characters around him, whether minor supporting or lead actors. It was almost as if he was doing a slightly older, bad impression of his character from Knocked Up.There could have been some really good bits. Like the kid who could get a boner on command. Could have been a great bit, but the timing was way off. This, like other things (magic mushrooms (again), breast milk pumping, calling the cops, the scene with Rogen/Byrne and the Dean, etc. etc.), seemed to be bad writing and bad directing.Never seen Efron in a movie before, but this didn't seem like his wheelhouse. Compared to okay performances by other good looking, cool/obnoxious bro characters (Reynolds as Van Wilder, William Scott as Stiffler) this effort just fell flat.Also thought they could have done more with Rogen/Byrne's friends, too. Carlo Gallo has some decent comedy chops, she was pretty good in Californication and more straight laced in Bones. And Ike whatever his last name is hilarious (The League, Eastbound and Down). Both seemed under used.All that being said, maybe it got better. I say that b/c I only made it through 62 minutes. It's the first movie I've walked out of in at least 10 years. I wanted to leave after 30 minutes, but I thought, ""give it a little time, more interaction w/the frat boys"". No. It was terrible, with a capital bull.I remember not making it through half of Anchorman and Dewey Cox the first time watching it and love both of those now. Maybe I'll give this a try once it's on HBO or something.

329,luxcen,appalling. meretricious.,1,13 May 2014,"If there were any justice this film should be a career killer for rogan, byrne, and efron.The sheer bankrupt cynicism that gets these worthless pictures financed is more or less guaranteed because they keep making money from a feral generation who think this is what humour is.But this is a comedy without humour or any redeeming merit. The studios go on believing rogan is funny because his films reference a lost generation of sybaritic wastrels, who have no cannon of judgement by which to measure taste and intelligence, but who have the price of a ticket.The mistakes are all in the writing -- the work of two no-hopers whose only track record is in collaborating with each other. They should go back and study the rudiments of plotting, structure and joke-writing itself.There wasn't a single laugh in my audience and overall, the picture is about as funny as a broken arm. the obscene language keeps on descending to idiocy in every rogan film until it has no impact left at all on a desensitised world.Efron's performance is borderline psychopathic and his internal dialogue shows on his face as disgust at himself. I have never seen such worrying ambivalence in an actor before. Actors don't know what is good and what is not. They rely utterly on feedback, but never quite believe the feedback. They call it going out on a limb and exposing themselves to risk. Their obsequious flunkies never tell them the truth so they find solace in anticipating the next good project and half-remembering the last bad one.The production is ugly, improvised and worthless. One shot is actually out of focus. But they think you don't notice such things.Do not see this film. Save your money. Don't encourage them to make another like it. Pass over the ordure you're being offered on a regular basis by the amoral cynics behind a class of film that will condemn this generation with all future generations.If you saw Movie 43, then you know exactly what to expect from this effort.

Most of my laughs came from Craig Robert character, the crudely named 'assjuice' however I may be slightly biased by this as he was in one of my favorite films of all time 'Submarine' and therefore I did have an obligatory giggle whenever he was on screen. Though I wasn't best pleased with his American accent. Another positive was Rose Byrne who was for all of the film much funnier than Seth Rogen. I get the feeling that Seth is just playing himself in films now and because of this all his characters become boring very fast as they are all the same. However you can tell that Rose Byrne is really enjoying herself and she adds a lot of energy to the film, which would have certainly failed without her.

Most of these other reviews were written by formal journalists or principals of elementary schools or something. I am a nineteen year old college student who loved Knocked Up, This is the End, and other Seth Rogen movies. In other reviews you'll see that those reviewers didn't like those movies. Well, no surprise they hated this one. It's not their sense of humor. It's not meant for them. It's meant for people like me, the immature kid who's willing to laugh at erection jokes and fraternity impossibilities.

There's a lot of bad language, sex jokes, and drug use but there's also a ton of great one liners and quotes that you'll be using with your friends for a good while. It should be looked at as a film that rivals Superbad and Stepbrothers, and will have you laughing from start to finish. So yes, it's a little over the top, but what raunch-com isn't? Seth Rogen is a genius. He's such a master of improv that you know when he's improvising because no one can deliver comedic lines that well if they were written.

If any of these viewers/reviewers know anything about a Seth Rogan film, then they should know it's going to be immature and full of sex jokes & drug use. The only exception would be ""Green Hornet,"" which is probably his most boring film. This movie was pretty damn funny. Not quite as good as ""The Hangover,"" which someone already mentioned, but definitely funnier than either of The Hangover Sequels. It was like an R-rated ""Grumpy Old Men"" mixed with ""Project X."" Funnier than ""Project X"" even (though nowhere near as timelessly funny as ""Grumpy Old Men."")I held off watching ""Neighbors"" for way too long based on the bad reviews, and was a touch worried at the start of the film that the humor would be too tame, since it initially sets up Seth & Rose's characters as a new family that can't party like they used to. Luckily Seth's wit was matched quite well by Rose, as well as by Zac & Dave. The pace of the story picked up quite well once the frat house was filled. For probably the first time, I did not watch a Seth Rogan film high and still laughed out loud unexpectedly quite a few times.

365,phil-pankhurst,Exactly what it set out to be.,9,21 August 2014,"So many people complaining about how awful this movie was, how vulgar and terrible it is, the problem with those reviewers is their missing the point of what this movie is supposed to be. It's not set out to be a classic masterpiece, it's not pretending to be anything other than a Seth Rogan comedy farce, and it delivers really very well. Be under no illusion, as with most movies staring one of Hollywoods most avid marijuana advocates it leans a lot toward people who are likely to watch this under the influence, that being said it's certainly not reliant on that, but if you're anti drug, steer clear.The comedy aspect is faced paced, and cleverly written, with the scenarios the characters find themselves in, always leading deeper and compounding the chaos before the culmination of the movie. The sincere points are relatable to some, feeling old, the stages of change having a baby brings about etc - as consistent with many movies in this category, the sincerity is heartfelt but not intended to be a humanity lesson, merely a script for a comedy movie where everyone is having a great laugh making it, and I imagine a lot of on set writing took place! - There's plenty of ad-libbing going on, and the actors are clearly comfortable exploring their characters. Yes it uses clichés, yes it is pro drug, vulgar and peppered heavily with sexual aspects, but the point every reviewer seems to be missing is that IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE! So many people review a movie as though it should conform to what their standard of film should be, rather than what the film is trying to be. It's akin to reviewing The Godfather as though it was meant to be a romantic comedy, it'll get 1 star. You can't review a movie like Neighbors without first being aware of what it is trying to achieve. And this achieves it well. IF you like Seth Rogan, his other films, or if you like the style of comedy associated with that his peer group, the Franco's, Jonah Hill, Jason Segel etc etc then you will thoroughly enjoy this movie I assure you.For those that claimed refunds and left the theater in a dramatical huff because the frat house wasn't abiding by the council by law and lawn keeping schedule, therefore this movie is factually incorrect...you have the entire internet at your fingertips, watch a few trailers, and don't just go to see a movie because you like the comedy genre, it's 2014 now, and you will often be disappointed!",Neighbors

But, its lacks a continuity in its humor, there are many parts of the movie where the comedy just drops down and the movie feels like a boring documentary on a couple dealing with frat house related problem. If you are a fan of Seth Rogen's work, you might find this pretty fun because, he stills brings his humor to the scenes that he is famous for. Some scenes are awkward but, funny. This movie did make me laugh but, it made me check my watch even more. Although the bad reviews, this is a pretty original story that could have been better brought up. Even though this is a comedy movie, the dramatic scenes did not fit in with the cast, there was a chemistry that was missing except for the couple which surprisingly better portrayed than I thought.

374,ajmaddison88-668-74144,Bad Neighbours is fun,6,19 September 2014,"There comes a point in life when you must make that all important decision: Do I grow up or carry on acting irresponsible?Nicholas Stoller's 'Bad Neighbours' (or 'Neighbours' as its called in the US) tackles the aspect of growing up, with a dash of comedy on the side. This is Stoller's fourth feature, and like his previous movies, he tries to put a fresh spin upon predictable Hollywood comedy. 'Bad Neighbours' is not too dissimilar to two of his more successful and better movies, his brilliant feature debut 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' and 2012's rom-com 'Five Year Engagement'.The premise of the story is simple enough, a frat house led by Teddy (Zac Efron) move next door to the couple Mac and Kelly (Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne) who have a new born. From that premise it is a constant battle of hilarious over-the-top pranks between the two houses. However 'Bad Neighbours' has the twist that each side want what the other has: Mac and Kelly went the party life, while Teddy wants a possible future beyond the wild parties and hot tub shenanigans.Rogen, who acts as producer with frequent collaborator Evan Goldberg, falls back into his usual 'Seth Rogen character' from 'Knocked Up' and 'Pineapple Express'. It is a far stretch from his more dramatic roles, such as '50/50'. Rogen offers nothing new with his character development and loud mouths his way through the movie. He does however have great chemistry with the excellent Rose Byrne. Byrne proves that she is more the capable a providing comedic prowess, even if she swears on cue throughout the movie, performing in her native Australian accent. It is scary how easily she can manipulate both a guy and girl into hooking up after kick starting their libidos with rounds of shots. An issue with both characters though, is how exaggerated and irresponsible they are. There are various scenes where you think: As a parent should you really do that?The most surprising element in the movie is Zac Efron's performance. Efron showcases his acting ability, which have drastically improved since his 'High School Musical' days, providing a well rounded performance as Teddy who is struggling with growing up. Teddy has the most character development, as we can see his decisions backfiring and you actually feel his regret when it dawns upon him he should have went to class.Other performances are solid, with Dave Franco as Pete, Teddy's intelligent sidekick with an amusing trick, Christopher Mintz-Plasse as a guy with a large 'package' and Ike Barinholtz who plays Jimmy, Mac's friend. The other frat members are forgettable, showing up now and then to provide comic relief.As a comedy 'Bad Neighbours' succeeds. The comedy is extremely over-the-top and crude at times, but it works and provides a lot of 'laugh out loud' moment. A lot of these moments are from the slapstick scenes, such as the airbag gag (unfortunately shown in the trailer) and the creation of home-made dildos.Overall the movie is hilarious and will provide you with ample over-the-top gags. It does have its short comings, though they are not enough to detract from the movie.Check out my website: alexjamesmaddison.wordpress.com for further reviews",Neighbors

376,odwyer_mary,To be avoided like the plague (or annoying neighbours),3,30 June 2014,"''Bad Neighbours''is a 2014 film directed by Nicholas Stoller, and stars Seth Rogen, Rose Byrne and Zac Efron. As one would probably expect (It being the latest in a string of repetitive, modern American comedies), the plot is simple and decidedly insignificant. It could be summarised as merely ''respectable family vs. rowdy frat-house'' but I presume a bit more effort is required on my part, trivial as it may be. Mac Radner (Seth Rogen) and his Australian wife Kelly (Rose Byrne) are a young, fresh-faced couple who move into a picturesque, seemingly-friendly neighbourhood shortly after the birth of their newborn child. Low and behold, they quickly discover that they live next door to an unruly frat-house led by Teddy Sanders (Zac Efron), who openly aspires that his current group will be immortalised as a particularly lively bunch. After an amiable introduction, things quickly turn sour, which inevitably leads to enmity between the two households.In comedies such as this, no-one expects any game-changers. The progression and ultimate conclusion of the plot are ostensibly the same every time, simply with a different setting and different characters. Hilarity is the only concern. The setting and premise merely act as a stage upon which jokes and gags can be performed. This means that the writing and directing must adequately do two main things - Establish a memorable premise, and come up with an exceedingly funny script. ''Bad Neighbours'' undoubtedly fails to do both these things.The premise of this movie is not memorable by any means. Not only is it inexplicably flawed, it is also shamelessly derived from superior frat- house comedies such as Animal House (1978) and Old School (2003). You may ask, how can a relatively simple plot like this be inherently flawed? Well, the conflict between the two central houses is relatively realistic, albeit hyperbolic. However, this movie seems to have forgotten that it takes place in the real world, not in a parallel universe devoid of any law and order. The other residents in the ''neighbourhood'' don't even bat an eyelid at their boisterous, destructive young neighbours. Rather, they are seldom featured, as if Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne are the only two residents of the neighbourhood that are not deaf and dumb. The writers try to avoid this inexcusable plot hole by including a short scene in which the the frat- house cheerfully (and cheesily) win over the other neighbours through various benefactions. In reality (which, I maintain, this movie is bizarrely out of touch with) such sentiments would hold no weight. Meaningless acts of kindness would certainly not ensure equanimity in the neighbourhood, especially considering the later actions of the frat- house. Figures of authority are perhaps even more absurd. These include a police officer who is quickly swayed by Efron's ridiculous pleading, as well a College Dean who's only concern is a positive reflection of her school in newspaper headlines. Never before have I seen characters as irredeemably quixotic as these put to film.Of course, one's biggest hope while watching a comedy is that it will actually be funny. Apart from a few quiet chuckles and repressed guffaws, this film failed to evoke any laughter from me. While I'm not the most expressive of moviegoers, I would have expected to break out into uncontrollable laughter on at least one occasion. Disappointingly, such an occasion never came. The script is, for the most part, boring and surprisingly innocuous. When gross-out scenes start to appear, they comes off as desperate. I would almost make the claim that I cannot fathom how anyone would find them funny, but such a statement is ignorant and pretentious. My favorite scene in the movie involves a random smattering of Robert De Niro and Samuel L. Jackson impressions, but this is mainly due to my liking of the respective actors, and not due to the integrity of the script itself.Whether it be because of the acting or because of the script, I also noticed a distinct lack of chemistry between Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne. I was certainly not convinced of their love for each other, but hey, what do I know? Most of the dialogue between them is jumpy, awkward, and unconvincing. At times it was almost like two drunk people having a conversation about how they are going to turn things around in their life. Everything feels fake, temporary and underdeveloped. This can be seen when they try to convince themselves that they are still young and hip - their childlike affirmations are embarrassing to say the least. Rose Byrne's confused Australian accent certainly doesn't help in this regard. The frat-house residents are formulaic. You've got the stoner, the dumb blondes, the ambitious boy who wants to leave the craziness behind him - they are not even worth discussing.The thing that I hated most about this movie was Zac Efron's character, Teddy Sanders. Efron's performance is standard, but the character of Teddy is despicable. Throughout the movie, he is portrayed as a malicious and unmotivated charlatan. At one point, he explicitly vows to do all he can to make his neighbours' life a living hell. It is saying something that I would rather have Walt Kowalski from Gran Torino (2008) as a neighbour than Teddy Sanders. Despite all this, attempts are made to evoke sympathy for him from the audience, such as the phony suggestion that his raucous and insensitive actions are made to mask his inner fear of an uncertain future. By the end, all his stupidity is pushed aside, and we are supposed to like him for it. The movie as a whole attempts to do the same thing - Use an empty, repetitive, boring plot, slap some likable actors on the poster, and hope the audience will like it. I don't like the Teddy, nor do I like this movie. In life, bad neighbours are something that one tends to avoid. A similar attitude should be shown towards this film.",Neighbors
377,intheinaka,So-So Stoller,7,4 May 2014,"'Bad Neighbours' (as it's titled here in the UK) is the latest feature from one of my favourite comedy writer/directors of the last few years, Nicholas Stoller. Featuring Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne (who worked with Stoller in Get Him to the Greek) as young parents pitted against the frat boy next door, Zac Efron, Bad Neighbours fails to hit the highs of the director's previous outings, but is solid fun all the same.Rogen and Byrne have recently taken the final step into mature, married life, sinking their savings into a new home in a nice neighbourhood, with the intention of raising their little daughter, Stella. They've barely taken down the 'sold' sign, however, before Efron and his fraternity buddies move in next door. The tried-and-tested formula is given a twist however, when it quickly becomes clear that Efron's character, for all his chest-bearing, hard-drinking ladishness, is actually a relatively sweet young man who is quite happy to try and accommodate his older neighbour's desire for a bit of late-night peace and quiet. Regardless, conflict inevitably ensues, and the best laughs are to be had from the scenes in which the three main cast members find themselves at loggerheads. Honourable nods as well to Dave Franco and The Mindy Projects Ike Barinholtz in supporting roles.Bad Neighbours lacks the emotional grounding of Forgetting Sarah Marshall, The Five Year Engagement or The Muppets (which Stoller wrote) and perhaps suggests that the director is at his best when he's working in tandem with Jason Segel (or perhaps that he should have penned the script himself); but it is certainly worth a watch, and is the best film I've seen starring Seth Rogen for a few years.",Neighbors

379,raynjuls,An Open Letter to Seth Rogan,2,3 November 2014,"Dear Seth,I just watched your latest effort in the ""Neighbors"". Here are a few tips for you, your current and future directors, writers, producers and movie execs, to help you to not make another movie that my somewhat intoxicated adult friends turn off less than half way through.1. Saying ""F*ck"" in every sentence does not give you street cred, nor is it particularly humorous after about 5 seconds. 2. You are in crappy physical shape. Quit having your writers put in sex scenes with you and the obviously unattainable women you are cast with. The sexual chemistry between you and Rose Byrne was about as believable as the chemistry between a swan and a water buffalo. 3. Watching a nearly middle-aged man-child get f'd up on shrooms, pot, etc. is about as entertaining as watching a dog lick its b*lls. It is mildly entertaining for about 10 seconds, and then is simply disgusting and annoying. 4. You are NOT a modern Jimmy Stewart ""everyman"" character. You are in fact the very antithesis of that. Overweight, pot smoking, video game playing D'bags that refuse to grow up have very little in common with folks that have to work for a living, raise a family and muddle through. 5. You are a middling character actor that, through some Faustian bargain, has become a quasi-leading man in romantic, raunchy comedies. Grow the F up, learn a little more range of emotion than ""Holy F*ck Man"" and ""I'm so F*cked up"", and maybe you can keep you soul (if you indeed ever had one).Sincerely, Raynjuls",Neighbors

I watched this movie a few days ago and I went to the movie theater with high expectations because of the fairly good rating (7,4 at the time of watching). But boy was I wrong. The story was nowhere near original, the acting felt wrong as if everything was improvised and the worst aspect: the jokes were only occasionally funny. I guess a lot of people in the movie theater shared this opinion since it was awkwardly silent at parts where you were supposed to laugh. I really missed someone hilarious like Steve Stifler in the American Pie movies whose quotes would stick around. For your money you get a dull comedy with lame jokes that you will most likely have forgotten the next day. Save your time and your well deserved cash and don't visit this one. Unless you find it funny when a baby eats a used condom. I'll give it a generous two because I did laugh two or three times.2/10",Neighbors

Then there was the f-bomb every other word, which I didn't care for. Then came the drugs! I'm against drugs, always was and will be, and I just couldn't stand how ""fantastic"" the movie made them look. Hated that. I was happy to see Zac Efron and Dave Franco, whom I find to be attractive, was moderately repulsive and made me uncomftorable.

I almost left (my parents told me to stay put) with my grandmother to go see The Amazing Spider-Man 2 again! I unfortunately had to sit until the horrific thing was finished. Waste of production.

And seeing him naked is something I sadly will never get out of my mind. The movie showed waaayyyy too many private areas, and was a disgrace to the movie industry. This film was poorly directed and written, and had only 3 truly funny parts in it (which were already shown in previews). The movie shows neglectful parents leaving their baby alone in their house while they went to party and try to start war with frat boys. About 70% of the movie is nudity, and the other 30% is taken up by drug use, sex, foul language, and down right DISGUSTING details. Might I add, they showed the baby eating a condom. I sound like a total parent here, but I'm just stating the truth. I LOVE movies like 21 jumpstreet, we're the millers, etc. But this film took things WAY too far, and I just felt very uncomfortable 99% of the movie.

Of course it was underneath the vulgarities and comedy, and purposely to an extent. But the main theme being fun.

Not that the gags and jokes aren't funny enough, they just seem misplaced all the time. It all would work perfectly as an animation, but this isn't the case.Eventually, as the dispute between the two houses get hotter, the script creates situations where the life of a baby is at risk, what isn't just not funny, but also clearly not the intention of the writers. What would have happened if Seth Rogen seated on the armchair with his daughter in his arms? Not to mention the condom scene and the HIV joke.The main couple, in the other hand, saves the movie, taking the married- and-getting-older thing to a much welcome fresher point of view. Both their arguments and sweet moments are delightful, for they don't come up as a worn off stereotype. We can finally see the female figure in a rare position, not claiming her husband to step out of the mess, but joining him in this immature journey.Gladly, this is a movie that has nothing to say about life, about growing up, about life decisions, etc. It has nothing to teach us, what is better than other dumb movies that try to shove ridiculous silver-linings down our throats every now and then.",Neighbors

Since when does Seth Rogen play the bad guy? This movie is all about making sure that the party next door stops. Normally, Seth Rogen plays one of the party animals, dumb guys or just a drug addict. this time he is the asshole. This movie could have bin great if other neighbors were complaining and Seth Rogen and Zac Efron would mess with them.All the other reviews look like they come from 30-40 year old people who have kids themselves. Of course it's a bad movie for them. I was just hoping this was another hilarious movie were Seth Rogen does some hilarious stuff (like pineapple express, 21/22 jump street, This is the end, Zack and Miri make a porno,...) I think they wanted to make the movie good for all ages (above 17-18 years old of course). so that young people could be cheering at the party and sex scenes, and older people could be like yeah, get those loud annoying teenagers out of that house and raise your child in peace! But the mix awesome party and hatred against parties just doesn't work.So basically, for me, the movie was to much about wining about an awesome party next door then the awesome party. It's still worth a 3/10 for laughing my ass off at the party, sex, hangover,... scenes, but after that, it went straight back to wining.",Neighbors
409,hunateist,"Pretty fun, unless you are prude/brainwashed",8,22 August 2014,"This is my first review, and there is a reason for it. I usually puke when i see these typical Hollywood movies, which are like a chain of cliché's. Now the Neighbours do have a few of those too, but its trying to break out of it. Most of the jokes are vulgar and childish, but i very much think that these kind of jokes are pretty entertaining and have their place in a movie like this. And these jokes are the reason why this movie is getting so many 1/10 ratings. The movie isn't that bad, but simply people are OUTRAGED, it goes against their typical cliché's and they are so used to those, that they cant accept anything else. This movie is like the American pie, but with more solid humor and not everything is about getting laid. I liked the movie and thats quite something...give it a goThe acting is alright. Surely the characters are a bit exaggerated, but normal people are quire boring, so deal with it :)",Neighbors

It is an insult to everything! I RARELY have such opinion about any movie, in general, but this one... really pushed me off the edge! DO NOT waste your time watching it... go to the car wash... more beneficial! Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne... was that acting??? Zac Efron... what did you tell yourself? Are you serious?

Not quite as good as most of Seth Rogen's films, but not far off. Lots of good laughs.

I HAD to write one for this movie. I do not like sabotage, and someone , a LOT of people have it out for this movie, . I just watched it.. VERY funny, solid. there is NOT rampant Fbomb profanity like they claim, yes, cussing, but its a SOLID comedy, with Seth Rogan doing his usual funny stuff, and zac efron carrying the lead very very well. I have NO clue why these fools choose to sabotage the movie on IMDb, but they are not telling the truth. Its a solid comedy, really good flick.This movie combines a lot of genres, it borrows heavily from Animal House, and is quite funny. The neighbors are really good, it has the Dean of the school played by Lisa Kudrow that does a good job, and all kinds of other surprises in the film. I would give it a higher score, but i do think an 8 is pretty solid. If you are a fan of Zac Efron, again you will like this flick, as he is always solid in everything he does.

413,pearlypilot,Felt rob of time and laughs watching this film,3,30 September 2014,"To use the word awful to descried this movie is a understatement. While I understood the main concept of the movie was the idea of struggling with growing older in life and having to let go of youthful actions that was once loved and done by the older couple, with the college kids representing the lost youth. The concept was dragged and felt like was beating a dead horse. The ""funny"" parts of the movie seem to be like every low brow comedy that was ever release using private parts, drugs and bunch of bad language to be ""funny"". While there is nothing wrong with raunchy humor, this movie heavily relied on it. Most of the movie seem to just drag on with many forgettable scenes and force laughs just to make yourself seem like you didn't completely wasted your time and money. As far as the acting, Seth Rogan seems to never really go into character, in fact it was just Seth Rogan being himself with a different name. Zac Efron as the glory frat boy who cared more about partying than school, fell very short. At times it seem to be like he was overacting a little bit too much. Dave Franco has the nerdy frat boy who likes to party, but has a good concept of why he's really in school for. His acting came across as fake and not believable to the character, at times was almost pain to watch. Overall the only reason I gave this movie a 3 was because of one scene where Zac Efron and Dave Franco characters were making up after a big fight and the conversation they had actually made me laugh pretty hard. The acting, storyline,and plot was unoriginal and not funny what to ever.",Neighbors
414,michael-gurdak,Is The New Neighbor Here To Stay?,7,1 October 2014,"One of the newer movies in town, Neighbors is chock full of crude humor intertwined in a storyline that mirrors concerns of the average homeowner about his or her neighbors: what if they throw rambunctious parties all of the time? Mac (Seth Rogan) and Kelly (Rose Byrne) Radner have just become parents and are attempting to leave their old lifestyles of immaturity behind, in order to become good parents. When the fraternity Delta Psi Beta moves into the house next door, the couple believes that they can talk to the owners about limiting the noise of their college parties. Teddy Sanders (Zac Efron), the president of the frat, agrees to keep the noise down. If the parties ever became too loud, Teddy asked the neighbors to come talk to him first instead of directly calling the cops. However, on a night when a massive party was thrown and Teddy wasn't answering his phone, Mac decides to anonymously call the police. The cop arrives at the scene, but is able to tell the frat who made the call, due to caller ID. Teddy is extremely disappointed that the promise was broken. The fraternity retaliates, from partying on the Radner's lawn to trimming one of the bushes to look like a bent over man. Mac and Kelly devise several plans to try to shut the fraternity down or make them move, but all to no avail. The plot comes down to one last party-crashing plan to try to stop the fraternity from destroying their livelihood.The acting and cast selection for this movie fit the storyline phenomenally. Director Nicholas Stoller did himself a major service by making the always hilarious Rogan a co-star of his movie. He was a perfect choice for the role of a dad who doesn't want to grow up. Efron fit the mold of a frat boy perfectly, with his attitude and college boy look. The supporting cast (Dave Franco, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, among others) was great as well, providing laughs and helping develop the characteristics of the college lifestyle along the way.The setting played effective to the movie's plot too. Filmed in what appeared to be a small neighborhood of older and lower end homes, this was the perfect backdrop for an up-start family to clash with a pack of college kids. Recording mainly took place on West 20th street in Los Angeles (movie-locations.com), the go-to party city for college students. Cinematography was accurate and up to date for a movie that was created in 2014. The lighting was excellent, as if you were at the actual scene. With a comedy movie like this, there never really becomes a moment where the story is dreary and sad. The colors were clear and crisp, and it was always sunny outside, thus contributing to the overall happy, lighthearted tone.Aside from the humor and excellent acting, setting, and graphics, the storyline to Neighbors seemed very predictable. It never took a turn that was out of the ordinary or contributed anything more to the movie. Once Mac called the cops on Delta Psi, it was just a constant retaliation battle back and forth between the neighbors. When the fraternity did things to tick the Radners off, the couple turned around and tried to retaliate with a plan to defame or ban the group. When the plan would fail, Delta Psi would retaliate back, and the whole cycle would start over again. Yes, the plans and pranks performed by both sides were interesting and funny at most times, but not unforeseen. Stoller could have done a better job of mixing things up instead of just a back and forth conflict of the plans and pranks.Overall, Neighbors was a fairly good film. It provided a lot of off-color humor that truly makes a movie a comedy. Any movie with Seth Rogen is almost guaranteed to be funny, so it is worth it to see his acting. It was easy to get somewhat of a lighthearted sense of what it would be like living next to college kids, more specifically a fraternity, as grown adults. But as stated earlier, the storyline was too predictable. This certainly was not a Quentin Tarantino movie. Stoller did a sufficient job of keeping the audience entertained, but he could have thrown in some curve balls that made the story that much more appealing. Todd Jorgenson of Cinemalogue,com agrees with just that in his review of the movie, saying ""the story meanders in a predictable direction"". But, he also adds that despite this, ""it features several inspired comic moments"".The humor that comes with a conflict between grown adults and college students is obviously the strong point in this movie and helps make up for the lack of a multi-layered plot. However, it does have some potential for re-watching. I give it a solid 7 out of 10.",Neighbors

416,s-g-waights,Horrible women-hating film,1,10 October 2014,"This was possibly the most horrible film I have ever seen. It seems like the only point of the film is the degradation of women. At every instance men and their bodies are portrayed in a good light whilst women and their bodies are portrayed negatively. In one particularly horrible part, the couple encourage a friend to join them in the fight against the nuisance frat boy neighbours by reminding him that one of the frat boys was having sex with his ex- wife. They remind their friend that the particular frat boy has a very large penis. Their friend is then driven to help them by the unpleasant thought of his ex wife's vagina being enlarged by a large penis. This would be to him like getting a lent t-shirt back from a larger friend that is all stretched.This is a really bad case of body-shaming, making women feel negatively about their sexual organs whilst trumpeting the man's.In another scene the frat boys mould dildos from their penises which, of course, all the women go wild for and they make thousands of dollars in sales. Constantly though this film, the men's body parts is portrayed as being fantastic whilst women's are regrettable or shamefulThe mother's breasts are shown as a constant source of difficulty. In one scene the father is shown squirting milk from the mothers breasts all over the room under the pretext that they needed to be 'milked' since they were nearly bursting. This was disrespectful and made the mother look ridiculous.The mother is also continuously shown as being homely and boring, whilst the father is a fun guy apparently tied down by his family. For example, when the couple go to a party, the mother is seen at the party timidly dancing and constantly checking the baby monitor, whilst the father goes completely wild doing magic mushrooms. She is shown talking to a group of girls who are apparently too stupid to do anything other than cooing and aahhing, whilst the father has a 'cool' conversation with one of the boys about batman actors.This sort of crap perpetuates the negative images in society of women, especially pregnant women and mothers. The extent of women- hatred in this film is unbearable. I felt utterly horrible after watching it. I only wish I could unwatch it.",Neighbors

If you enjoy your comedies vulgar and crude, with plenty of sexual innuendos, condom gags and actual sex scenes, Neighbors will hit the mark. However, if you desire more sophisticated comedy (such as, say, the kind that was common in movies twenty, thirty years ago), Neighbors will fall far short of the goal. It has its moments of enjoyment (the finale, airbag scene and the Batman argument between Zac Efron and Seth Rogen were my favorites), but in between there will be scene after scene of condoms, nudity and other crude references.

419,miller-6007,Neighbors,4,25 November 2014,"It's taken me almost a fortnight to get around to writing this review. That tells you pretty much everything about Bad Neighbours (or Neighbors if you're in the USA).The 'selling point' that it's a brash comedy ""From the guys who brought you This is the End"" was enough to put me off from the outset. Then I saw the trailer, laughed out loud and chided myself for judging Bad Neighbours prematurely.The trouble is, both funny moments are in the trailer and they're just not funny second time around.I'm well aware that Bad Neighbours' target demographic is late teens to late twenties and I was fortunate to find the perfect audience to watch Mac (Seth Rogan) and Kelly (Rose Byrne) romp about with hilarity in their neighbourhood warfare with Teddy (Zac Effron) and his fraternity when they move in next door. However, guess how many laughs I heard from the audience? I could hold up five fingers and have a handful of change.It stinks. It is severely over-egged, lacks restraint, completely misses the delicate art of comedy and eschews the rule 'leave them wanting more.' Bad Neighbours doesn't know when to stop and probably shouldn't have started in the first place.There are some comedic gems that are visually set up and then pummeled until absolutely every dim-witted drunk in the audience 'gets' it. Sex with topiary? Yep, we'll keep on humping that sculpted bush until subtlety becomes a distant dream.Bad Neighbours is (yet again) another great idea for a work of comedic art that is hammered rather than sculpted. Director Nicholas Stoller (The Five-Year Engagement) has forgotten to rein in his actors and attempted to wring a laugh out of every single syllable rather than stepping back and looking at the effect of the broad canvas.The result is a labored, embarrassing mess. Think: Animal House for the lobotomized.",Neighbors
420,inalertness4055,Horrible,2,4 December 2014,"Not sure I can add much that has not already been said in previous reviews. I rented this, and settled down with the wife expecting a movie that would reflect the 73 score given to it by critics. What I got was a film with maybe three laughs that you can see watching the trailer, and the rest filled in by painfully unfunny trite.Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne are a totally unconvincing young middle class couple who have the misfortune of having a fraternity move in next to them. What follows is a series of dumb skits (the ""plot"" is non-existent here) that will leave you...well staring at the screen waiting for the laughter to start. There is not a single believable moment here. Most of the jokes fall flat, others take things too far (think cringe factor here), and others will just leave you rolling your eyes thinking you are watching a Setzer/Friedman film. The characters actions here are so ridiculous and over the top that for a second I thought this was an Adam Sandler film. Rogen looks like he is at least trying, but it is not nearly enough. Byrne checks out to the level where she does not even try and hide her accent. And Effron, who actually has some talent, looks completely lost. This does not work is a normal comedy, it does not work as a dumb comedy, it does not work as a bawdy comedy, it falls flat on every conceivable level. It is a shame, because there is talent here, and the film's premise is a promising one.The director of this movie is Nick Stoller. His previous efforts include the actual funny films Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him to the Greek. I have no idea what went wrong on this film (well, the script was probably the beginning, but alas), as both he and the actors apparently gave up very early in production.

It's about two neighbors and after the couple gets tired of all the loudness and parting every night they call the cops and that meant war. Teddy said to just let them know if they are being too loud instead of calling the cops and they didn't so they decided to mess with them and it just keeps on going back and forth.
