0,TheLittleSongbird,"The worst of the series, and a big disappointment",3,3 September 2010,"I enjoyed the first two Mummy movies, they were pretty mindless but very likable. But this one was a big disappointment, and by far the worst of the series. Granted, the scenery and cinematography are very good, the music is good enough(no Jerry Goldsmith and Alan Silvestri though) and Jet Li does try hard in his role. But the direction is uninspired, the story is clichéd(as are the characters), the pacing is uneven, the CGI is superficial and distracting, the script is awful and with the exception of Li(the only actor who tries) the acting is dreadful. Maria Bello is alluring but forgets her acting skills, Brendan Fraser is disappointingly bland and John Hannah's Jonathan is rather tiresome. The comedy and adventure this time around seems rather tired too. Overall, a big disappointment. 3/10 Bethany Cox",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
1,bkoganbing,My Mummy's Eyes,5,1 August 2008,"For the third Mummy film, The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, the location and time and place have now shifted to China in the post World War II years. For those of you historically minded, this was the years of struggle between the Chinese Communists and the Kuomintang government of Chiang Kai-Shek. But there's another guy with bigger ideas than all of them. Someone of course we don't hear about in the history books.That would be Anthony Wong Chau-Sang playing one General Yang. He's got a plan all his own to take over China and maybe the rest of the world. He's been dabbling in the Chinese occult and he's on to a way to raise the legendary Dragon Emperor and his entire army. The Dragon Emperor discovered the secret of immortality, but a girl who was two timing him for his chief general and was also a Chinese witch, puts a curse on him.First things first and that is raise the Mummy. For that we get the son of that famous archaeologist Brendan Fraser and Maria Bello from the twenties and that would be Luke Ford. Then get the magic jewel needed to raise him. After that it's a merry chase through war torn China to, and I kid you not, Shangri-La.Tomb of the Dragon Emperor moves at the pace of an Indiana Jones flick and this one bares no small resemblance to Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade. Imagine that one set in Tibet and you've got some idea of what this one is like. Tomb of the Dragon Emperor also makes Indiana Jones look like a Shakespearean classic.The computer graphics are nice and the trick is not to take this kind of film too seriously. The actors sure didn't I can tell you. Then you can enjoy it.And if you don't break into convulsions when the Abominable Snowmen are called in to aide Fraser and company, you have no sense of humor. Or when Emperor Jet Li turns into a three headed dragon. This film is an absolute hoot.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
2,Leofwine_draca,Such potential,4,15 November 2011,"Hearing that the third in this kiddie-friendly family series was to involve an ancient Chinese mummy rather than the usual Egyptian Pharaoh, I decided to give it a chance. After all, I love China and both Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh, who star, are favourites of mine. Sadly, about halfway through the production I realised that the filmmakers were happy to carry on making the same kind of nonsense as in the first two movies. The Chinese setting doesn't even come into it, except for the presence of a few familiar Chinese actors (such as Anthony Wong).The story is thin and overpowered with all manner of special effects that leave nothing to the imagination. I'll admit, I loved the look of Jet Li's mummy in this one, even if the actor hardly got the opportunity to actually appear on film (and Michelle Yeoh, as an ancient sorceress, gets even less screen time). The stuff involving the terracotta army, fine. But who on earth decided to include the stupid yetis in this film, and turn it into a ridiculous I'd-laugh-at-it-even-if-I-was-a-kid movie? Chase builds upon chase, there's a massive CGI battle at the climax and the humour comes thick, fast and stupid. John Hannah has by now played one of the most irritating character in film no less than three times, and shows no signs of slowing down. Fraser is wooden, Bello a poor replacement for the poor Weisz (enough of that plummy accent already) and Luke Ford is a meathead, plain and simple. Let's hope they don't make a fourth!",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
3,SnoopyStyle,Bloated CGI movie without any fun,4,4 January 2014,"Evil Emperor Han (Jet Li) was cursed by the sorceress Zi Yuan (Michelle Yeoh) who transformed him and his army into mummies. In 1946, Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and Evelyn O'Connell (Maria Bello) are retired from their adventures. They are asked to help return the Eye of Shangri-La back to China. Unbeknowst to them, their son Alex (Luke Ford) is digging in China, and discovers the tomb of the Emperor. It's a horrible way to lose Rachel Weiz as if she was never real. But I guess they couldn't think of a good way to write out her character. Fraser and Bello just can't get the same chemistry back. Luke Ford is a dud. Jet Li is a rather cold unexciting villain. This is basically an exercise in injecting as much CGI action as possible. After yet another endless battle or fight, they all become meaningless.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
4,claudio_carvalho,Entertaining and Funny Conclusion of the Trilogy,7,22 November 2008,"Centuries ago, the evil Emperor Han (Jet Li) was cursed with his army by the sorceress Zi Juan (Michelle Yeoh) and transformed into a mummy. In 1946, the explorer Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and his wife Evelyn O'Connell (Maria Bello) are invited by the British government to take the relic The Eye of Shangri-La to China. The ancient stone is capable to resurrect the Emperor Han and to point the way to Shangri-la and give eternal life to Han. When the couple reaches China, they meet their son Alex O'Connell (Luke Ford), who has discovered the tomb of Han, and Evelyn's brother Jonathan Carnahan (John Hannah) in his night-club. However, they are betrayed by their friend Prof. Roger Wilson (David Calder), who is associated to General Yang (Chau Sang Anthony Wong) that wants to serve Emperor Han. He resurrects the mummy and the guardian of the tomb and Zi's daughter Lin (Isabella Leong) tells them that the only way to destroy Han is avoiding that he reaches Shangri-la and stabbing his heart with a dagger cursed by her mother. They travel to the Himalaya in the beginning of another adventure of Rick and his family.""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" is another entertaining and funny adventure of Rick and Evelyn O'Connell and her brother Jonathan Carnahan, in spite of the absence of Rachel Weisz and the excessive explosions and CGI. I glanced many unfair reviews in IMDb, but I liked this conclusion of the trilogy. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Múmia  A Tumba do Imperador Dragão"" (""The Mummy - The Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"")",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
5,classicsoncall,"""I guess mummies bring out the best in me.""",7,18 November 2020,"Somehow I missed the first sequel which I might have to go back to see, but this is one that's certainly not necessary. Brendan Fraser looked like he could have taken a pass here, and I won't even mention the absence of Rachel Weisz, which somehow I just managed to do. The story is OK as a stand alone I guess, but by now we pretty much get the idea of corpses coming back to life and endangering the entire world. I did have to marvel at the Big Band sound at a Shanghai night club, you think that was historically accurate? There are some good action sequences in the picture, with the wagon chase through the streets of Shanghai of particular note. And while John Hannah provided a bit of comic relief to the story, it just didn't feel the same as the original. But boy oh boy, things seemed to go downhill during the second half, and I was struck repeatedly by the cliched dialog that made me cringe every time I heard some goofy line like Alex (Luke Ford) to his father Rick (Fraser) - ""When I saw you lying there, Dad, I... I've never been so scared in my life"". Special effects aside, this one ran pretty much by the numbers and ultimately comes across as less than memorable. Nice touch with the Yetis though.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
6,gavin6942,Full of Action But Not much Else,6,17 April 2011,"Despite not being a fan of Brandan Fraser, I generally enjoyed this film, brought to you by the largest special effects crew I have ever seen attached to a movie.Most people seem to dislike it because Rachel Weisz is no longer in it. I respect that. I am a big fan of continuity, and would agree that if you cannot get Weisz, you could at least write her out somehow. But if that is your biggest problem, look at the film again.The plot is thin and probably makes little sense. There are yeti, more mummy curses, and other strange things. I felt like I was watching a ""National Treasure"" film, with all the intelligent historical references removed. But the action was good, if I overlooked the effects.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
7,jboothmillard,The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,3,27 December 2010,"Taking over from Stephen Sommers, director Rob Cohen (Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story, Dragonheart, The Fast and the Furious) drops the Imhotep storyline and give us a brand new and not as good plot. Basically centuries ago in Asia, Emperor Han (Jet Li) was cursed by sorceress Zi Yuan (Michelle Yeoh) after he tried to raise a bigger army, so he and the one he had were turned into mummies. Forward to 1946, Rick O'Connell (National Movie Award nominated Brendan Fraser) and his wife Evelyn 'Evy' (Maria Bello, replacing Rachel Weisz) have retired from exploration, but are invited to take the relic diamond ""The Eye of Shangri-La"" to China for the British government. The stone is what can resurrect Emperor Han and his army, but it is also capable of guiding whoever has it to Shangri-La where there is the pool of eternal. So the couple reach China, and there they meet son Alex (Luke Ford) who has been excavating the sight believed to contain the Emporer's tomb, and Evy's brother Jonathan Carnahan (John Hannah) comes along too. An associate of General Yang (Anthony Wong Chau-Sang), Prof. Roger Wilson (David Calder) betrays the O'Connell's trust, and help's to resurrect the dreaded mummy Emperor and his army, and now they are trying to find a way to put them back in their graves. Then they find the guardian of the Emperor's tomb, Lin (Isabella Leong), daughter of Zi Yuan, who has have left for two thousand years thanks to the pool, and she knows how to kill the Emperor. She has a sacred dagger that has to be stabbed in the ruler's heart before he finds the pool of eternal life himself and raises a much more vast, dangerous and unstoppable army of soldiers. After she sacrificing their immortality, Zi Yuan is killed in action, but Rick manages to stab the Emperor with Lin's dagger, the mummy army disappear into the sands of time, and everything is fine. The acting is still as, if not more, cheesy like the predecessors, Li as the Emperor isn't a big deal, the story is only interesting in part, and the special effects are okay, overall, not a period horror adventure sequel I'd really see again. It was nominated the National Movie Award for Best Action/Adventure. Adequate!",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
8,ccthemovieman-1,"Yes, It's Bad, But So Were The Others",5,28 April 2009,"Wow, I've never seen so many negative reviews in my life. Most people here really hated this movie. Thankfully, after reading some of these, my expectations were extremely before I saw a DVD of this movie. As usually happens in that case, the film turns out to be - yes, bad - but not as bad as expected.This Mummy version, the third in recent years, was entertaining and had some cool special-effects. Was it dumb? Sure. Did it insult your intelligence? Certainly, but do honestly think first two Mummy movies were ""intelligent?"" I don't think so! Duh.....they're all dumb! They are only supposed to entertain us with a wild stories and even wilder special-effects. That's it. They are hardly educational! The dialog is stupid and the characters mostly annoying, and you go with it (or skip it)..I admit the story in this Mummy is even dumber than the first two films. You shake your head in amazement at some of the stupid dialog in here by all of the leading characters. No one is spared. The ""kid"" is probably the least offensive of the lead roles. That's ""Rick O'Connell's (Brendan Fraser) son, ""Alex,"" played by Luke Ford. Thankfully, the stereotypical bickering son-and-father routine doesn't last the whole movie as they all get on the same page in fighting some (typically) bizarre superhuman zombie-like villain whose face keeps falling off. Rick's wife ""Evelyn"" (Maria Bello, joins the fray, of course. All three of them have a kill ratio of about 25-0, which is part of the nonsense.No point going into the story; it's too dumb. But, if you like FX (especially on the Blu-Ray disc), there are some jaw-dropping scenes that it make fun to watch here and there. Obviously, you ignore the story.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
9,Tweekums,The O'Connells must stop an ancient Chinese mummy this time,7,5 February 2017,"In ancient China the warlord Qin Shi Huang conquered the surrounding kingdoms, learnt magical powers and was declared emperor; that wasn't enough though he wanted immortality. To this end he summons Zi Yuan, a sorceress, who has the power to make him immortal. She casts a spell then he kills his friend and closest ally, who is also Zi Yuan's lover. It then turns out she has cursed him and his army; he burns while his army turns to terracotta.In 1946 Alex O'Connell, the son of Rick and Evelyn, the protagonists in the original two film, is searching for Qin Shi Huang's tomb. He finds in and, after surviving a number of traps, excavates it. Its contents are then taken to Shanghai. In an apparent coincidence Rick and Evelyn have been asked to transport the 'Eye of Shangri-La' to China. They are reunited with Alex just as they all learn that they have been betrayed; General Yang, a rogue military commander, has plans to use the eye to raise the emperor from the dead so that he can rule not just China but the whole world. The Emperor is brought back to life but is still effected by the curse; if he is to be free of the curse and raise his army the Emperor must travel to Shangri-La something that the O'Connell's, along with Lin, a beautiful Chinese woman who is charged with guarding the tomb and has the only weapon that can kill the emperor, and Rick's brother in law, Jonathan Carnahan, are determined to stop.This the third of the Mummy movies was entertaining for the most part; I liked how the action had moved to a new location even if it was probably motivated by a desire to make money in China. The action is almost non-stop and for the most pert it is pretty exciting. Introducing Rick's son added a sense of danger as at one point it looked as though Rick was going to die and pass the baton as series protagonist to Alex. The cast did a solid enough job although I missed Rachel Weisz, in the role of Evelyn; Maria Bello wasn't bad in the role but I think it would have been better if she had been an entirely different character. Luke Ford was a good addition as Alex and I enjoyed Isabella Leong's performance as Lin. Michelle Yeoh impressed as Lin and Jet Li was okay as the Emperor sadly most of the time he was hidden behind CGI so felt somewhat underused. As well as action there was plenty to laugh out; some of the gags were more groan inducing than laugh out loud funny but that didn't matter. Overall this isn't a must see film but it is solid enough and while there is a lot of action it is of the type that can be enjoyed by most ages.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

11,Quinoa1984,just one more big-time money maker with no soul and mundane (though continuous) action,3,7 August 2008,"I guess I remember liking the first two Mummy movies well enough (matter of fact if I look back at my old reviews they might have been given B+ a piece), but at the same time I never remember having a desire to re-watch the movies either after seeing them once as a big-time summer blockbuster as a teenager. With Mummy 3, they're not even trying anymore, and simply isn't worth your time let alone your money. It's just soulless Hollywood product propped up to try and squeeze any drops left in a franchise that is a *reboot* of the original 1930's Mummy series. In short, it's a little like the Transformers of 2008, although I don't even think this will have its defenders like Bay's cluster-f***.Now, granted, I wasn't expecting anything really spectacular- frankly it's hard to imagine Dark Knight being topped for pure excitement as a summer movie- but here it's just dumb, and not always the kind of 'fun' dumb that I was hoping for (or that might be attempted by the writers). It's basically a rehash of the plot of Hero, and ironically stars Jet Li and Maggie Cheung as the main players, and Li plays this Dragon emperor who wanted to take over the world and was ruthless but got frozen in time. His curse is unlocked, however, in the 1940s, and set to reign all over again with his 'mummy' army. Then steps in the O'Connell family (Brendan Fraser, Maria Bello inexplicably replacing Rachel Weisz, and Luke Ford as son Alex) to get back in action once again to try and stop this mummy invasion... again.To try and go for any plot is more than just moot; in the past movies, for all is homaging (or just ripping off) of Indiana Jones movies and old-time matinée serials, there were some original ideas and visuals and action set pieces. This time, it's all just a continual loop of Indiana Jones rip-offs (a friend of mine repeatedly whispered ""oh no, it's not from Raiders"" or ""it's not from Last Crusade"" sarcastically). There's almost no real invention, even as the climax goes for ANOTHER rip-off (300, anyone?), and the one cool part of the movie- the Yetties (is that how its spelled) who are big, hilarious abominable snowmen- lasts all too short an amount of time to have any fun. The rest of the running time is used up for corny, un-funny ""jokes"" and dialog, false romantic sub-plots, and a performance from Jet Li that is practically non-existent (and, in fact, he's mostly a skeleton for half the running time despite getting second billing). Did I mention the new addition, Luke Ford, is so bland and annoying that he makes Brendan Fraser a charisma magnet? It's simply another studio piece of 'whatever', not a total bomb but without a shred of invention or intelligence in the writing or direction. If it's on TV, watch it for a minute and decide what's going on. But it's bound to be a disappointment even for those who somehow have a nostalgia (yeah, nostalgia within a decade) for Mummy and Mummy Returns.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
12,hitchcockthelegend,"Not the same Mummy twice, nor thrice for that matter.",4,24 March 2010,"Well it's been pretty much universally panned has this third Brendan Fraser led instalment of the new age Mummy series. So lets not beat around the bush here, it's not very good, but it's hardly deserving of the 1/10 ratings it has been given by amateur on line reviewers.The plot (for what it's worth) sees young Alex O'Connell, now amazingly a grown man in a short space of time, unearth evil old Chinese Emperor Han and his accursed Terracotta Army. Naturally some bonehead is going to bring him back from the dead, and naturally the now retired O'Connell's are forced back into their Mummy fighting ways. Can Rick, Evelyn and poor Jonathan save the day? Will Alex prove his credentials as the offspring of such daring-do parents? Will anybody care come the finale?Rachael Weisz has (wisely) bailed and into her shoes comes a woeful Maria Bello, with fluctuating accents and zero chemistry with her leading man, Bello has undone the promise shown in World Trade Center & A History Of Violence. Steer clear of action movies dear. Fraser looks bored and can barely muster the energy to deliver the now tired and stilted lines. He admitted once that The Mummy 2 was basically a cheeky remake of the first film, quite what he has to say about this one I await with much interest. John Hannah is merely a bystander and it's probably the easiest money he will ever earn, an utter waste it be. Luke Ford does OK as Alex and Michelle Yeoh, Jet Li (the Emperor) & the beautiful Isabella Leong make do with what the unimaginative script gives them to do.What saves the film from being a bottom of the barrel feeder is the action quota. Even though the spectre of poor CGI hangs around every corner, the sequences come thick and fast and they at least keep the blood pumping, thus stopping the audience themselves from drifting into a centuries long sleep. There's some good gags too (you will yearn for more of Liam Cunningham), while the choreography for the fights involving the Asian stars is not to be sniffed at. Stephen Sommers left the directors chair for this one, handing over to Rob Cohen, which explains why the film is more concerned with action accelerate over substance. But Sommers, who gave us a genuine genre delight with the first film, has a writing credit and was on production duties for this effort. I trust he now feels saddened by what his franchise has now become. 4/10",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

It's not like anyone will notice or care "" I can't really say I cared about this film or the franchise . Thankfully it doesn't have Stephen Sommers as director but that's hardly a selling point and this is total "" let's wring out as much money as possible from the gullible multiplex audience "" fodder .

Everything is noisy , flashy loosely plotted with nearly everything existing to set up a tongue in cheek CGI laden set pieces that you've seen twice before in the first two films .

14,Doylenf,Good popcorn movie is loaded with almost too much action...,6,12 August 2008,"A little more concentration on a witty script would have helped out when they decided to film THE MUMMY: TOMB OF THE DRAGON EMPEROR. But to tell the truth, this one in ""The Mummy"" series starring BRENDAN FRASER is a lot better than you would suspect from some of these reviews.Fraser gets to mouth some good lines once in awhile, but his performance seems to be lacking the sort of vitality he showed in the earlier ""Mummy"" films. MARIA BELLO has a convincing British accent but she's really not an acceptable replacement for RACHEL WEISZ nor does she blend well with Fraser. And, as others have commented, Luke FORD does look a bit too mature to be their grown son who has a habit of getting into trouble on a regular basis.It's a good thing JOHN HANNAH is around to lighten things up considerably whenever the action scenes need to be punched up a bit with laughter. He's the best holdover from the others in ""The Mummy"" series.It's obvious that this was an expensive undertaking--with striking use of sets, costumes and CGI--as well as a busy background score that accents all the danger and thrills. I found it an enjoyable way to spend a summer afternoon getting away from New York's humidity.Summing up: An exotic feast for the eyes, all style but not too much content.

The triumvirate of Fraser/Weisz and Hannah kept the first two ""Mummy"" films pacy and fun; this one is almost torporific as it sets about to resuscitate an ancient Chinese emperor who wants to take over the world.

Luke Ford adds nothing as a rather unlikely hero and although Liam Cunningham tries to inject a little humour this film falls pretty flat.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
16,dbborroughs,disappointing,5,10 August 2008,"Disappointing third film in the Brandon Fraser series of undead frolics.After the second world war the son of Rick and Evie ahas dropped out of college and managed to find the tomb of dragon emperor. he had been cursed by Michelle Yeoh two thousand years earlier when he asked her to give him immortality. Just before the artifacts are to be displayed Riok and Evie show up in Shanghai to deliver a jewel to a museum there. Its quickly transpires its all a set up to resurrect the emperor by a general who wants to share in his power. The emperor is brought back to life and back on the trail of immortality.This mad romp only works in fits in starts. I don't know if its the fact that the film essentially mashes the first two films together and resets them in China or if there are other problems. Probably its a combination of both. I know the recasting of Mario Bello as Evie hurts the film. Its not until the second half of the film where she becomes more of an action gal that she finally seems comfortable in the role. Jet Li cut an imposing figure but other than his brief tussle with Yeoh there is no reason that he needed to be cast (Though I'm guessing Sammo would be too heavy and Jackie Chan would never be accepted as a villain). I know the fact that film is far from the organic engines of the first two hurts it. Where the earlier films moved from location to location, this film jumps from set piece to set piece simply because thats where the next bit of action is.Its not bad, its just not gripping. Frankly until the final set piece at the great wall there is no sense of danger because you know the characters have to get to this one place for this one fight. The earlier films had a sense of anything could happen and anyone could get hurt, thats not the case here.Huge disappointment. Watchable, but far from even a guilty pleasure. Let me put it this way, there is a reason the first two films are forever on rerun on cable, they are entertaining and grab you when ever you step into them, this one never grabs you at any point and so will not join the earlier films in rerun hell.5ish out of 10",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
17,Boba_Fett1138,The series taking a big fall.,5,20 April 2012,"Honestly, I liked the previous two Mummy movies for what they were but this one is really hard to enjoy however.Hard to say were things went wrong, since it's a combination of so many factors. First of all, it's having a different director this time around, so the style and approach to it is already quite different, when compared to the two previous movies, directed by Stephen Sommers. He understood the characters, its universe and the do's and don't's with it all, while Rob Cohen, who directed this movie, clearly was all new to it and was just shooting away, without any regard to telling a good story, or let the characters do the things the audience wants and expects to see them do.It was also quite weird for the series to take a totally different approach this time with its settings. China just ain't no Egypt and watching a bunch of mummies walking around there just doesn't ever feel right. It's a totally different atmosphere and mythology involved. But really, this is all perhaps still the least of the movie its problems.It simply didn't had a very good script to work with. First of all, the buildup to it all is taking far too long and when the pace and action starts to kick in, you are almost constantly wondering to yourself what it is that you are watching exactly. All of the action seems to happen so very random and certain characters just come and go, whenever the movie pleases. It besides is lacking a good, original and clear main plot line. OK so the emperor mummy, played by Jet Li, is evil but why exactly? And what does he want? The movie too often doesn't really seem to be heading anywhere and most of the stuff seems to happen without any consequences, which also already takes away quite a lot of its tension and any of the involvement with its characters and story.Basically all of the The Mummy movies had been some Indiana Jones knockoffs but this movie really takes the cake. It comes across as some real lazy writing when a typical Indiana Jones moments happens in this movie, that isn't being original or creative in any way.And really, when Rachel Weisz refused to reprise her role in this movie, her character should had been written out and not recast. Or maybe this was just something that bothered me because Maria Bello did such an awful job at playing the Evelyn character. But none of the actors really come across too well, with perhaps an exception to John Hannah, who simply continued to do his thing as the comical relief of the series.The movie was also being a bit too heavy on its special effects, which became especially distracting because not all of the CGI effects were that great to look at, though obviously plenty of money still got pumped into this movie.No, it's not a completely horrible movie and not really one that I hated watching, though I'm probably still making it sound that way right now. As simple entertainment, it does has its moments but overall there really is no way I would recommend this movie to anyone.5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

Does Weisz at least return? Nope, she could smell the script from far away. At least she's replaced with one of the hot chicks in this. Thus, the acting in this is lousy. OK, Vosloo and The Rock are just as unconvincing as him, but they can be *fun* to watch... Jet Li isn't, nor is he intimidating in the least. One girl can't decide on which specific British accent she wants to butcher. As far as Rob Cohen vs. Stephen Sommers, it's tough to say who's more inept and ADD'ed. They both clearly prefer style over substance. Well, the latter insists on overwhelming us with a screen full of stimuli. The CGI tends to be pretty bad, actually... granted, there are some decent visuals. Unfortunately, the director would rather linger on those than be interesting. What can I say, this is just not entertaining. Well, a little of the action, with martial arts, unarmed or with swords, is reasonable. That alone raised this from the lowest possible rating I could give. While I could tell this would be painful from the trailers(as with the first two that I didn't care for either), I didn't know it would be a full-on extraction of multiple teeth sans anesthesia. At least it was on TV, I didn't pay for it. I recommend this to those who refuse to listen to warnings. 2/10",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

Lackluster third entry into the vastly popular ""Mummy"" franchise with Fraser's reluctant hero archaeologist Rick O'Connell trying to save his son (newcomer Ford) from the fate of unearthing the remains of an evil Chinese emperor (Li). Director Rob Cohen's overuse of CGI is an assault on the senses throwing everything from mummies, to dragons, to Abominable Snowmen (!) oh, my! with overloaded synaptic hamfistedness.

20,neil-476,Great fun,8,6 August 2008,"If you didn't like the previous two movies, you're not going to like this one. I did, and was predisposed towards this one, and thoroughly enjoyed it.The story is quite strong enough to act as a vehicle for the visuals, and the visuals are a delight. In particular, there is meat on the bones - the film addresses the emptiness of Rick and Evie O'Connell's lives now they have forsworn danger and adventure, and also the way they (and Rick in particular) have developed a dysfunctional relationship with son Alex who, in every way, is a chip off the old block.This movie is, in many ways, a strong CGI successor to the Harryhausen school of big, over-the-top animated movie monsters, with some great creatures (both goodies and baddies).The cast is good, with Brendan Fraser being given such strong support that he doesn't have to carry the film on his own. I never cared for Rachel Weisz particularly, so I'm not unhappy to see Maria Bello in the role of Evie, despite her posh British accent not ringing 100% true. Michelle Yeoh is always a class act, and Jet Li brings his customary gravitas as the Emperor, albeit not so much by way of martial arts. John Hannah once again gets all the best lines, my favourite being ""She speaks Yeti??"" There is a missed opportunity towards the end for a (necessarily brief) reunion to have taken place between the resuscitated General Ming and his consort and daughter.But this is really just an action-packed eye-catching romp - popcorn-munching fun, firing on all cylinders.Smashing!",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

The Dragon Emperor is revived after a curse placed on him by a woman whose lover he murdered. He wishes to become immortal but is stopped by those who hadn't the opportunity to employ their talent to a better film. Director Rob Cohen loses control quickly. He is responsible for bringing the world Dragonheart and The Fast and the Furious. Brendan Fraser is back and his irritating son is grown up and rising Dragon Emperors. Fraser is no Harrison Ford and here he seems to be running the same stupid drill. Maria Bello plays his wife because Rachel Weisz probably realized just how stupid the script is. Jet Li plays the ill tempered Dragon Emperor who can shape shift. Li can do these types of roles and here he goes from being slain, to being revived to wage war. His defeat is one of those dim explanation bits leaving us wondering why the weapon actually works. Michelle Yeoh plays the woman who cursed him due too the death of her lover. Or perhaps she was so angry about being cast in this junk that she decided that she needed to take it out on someone and Li seemed fit.

22,FlashCallahan,The Yak yacked!!!,6,17 July 2015,"It's 1946 and Rick has retired and Evie has changed into Maria Bello, who is also now an author. After a bit of espionage during World War II they decided it's now the easy life for them. The only problem is that they are becoming bored ,so they jump at the chance to deliver a precious gem which the UK government is returning to China. Jonathan is now running a nightclub in Shanghai, and they are surprised to also find their son Alex, who is supposed to be at university, is on an archaeological dig with an old friend, Professor Roger Wilson. They soon find themselves involved, as a corrupt Chinese General needs the gem to resurrect Emperor Han and his army who have been dead for thousands of years......The first two Mummy movies weren't the best thing in the world, but Sommers and Fraser gave the movies the desperate edge that they needed. Unfortunately, despite the sound plot, and the flowing narrative, the film just feels desperate.Like the same years Indiana Jones movie, this three-quel feels like its trying to pass the torch to Alex, in order to restart the franchise for a new audience, and it just tries too hard. Fraser is as good as ever, Bello is a wonderful replacement for Wiesz, but the chemistry is lacking between the leads.Hannah goes full bonkers as Jonathan, cranking up the hilarious sidekick knob to eleven, and spoiling the charm he had in the previous entries, and the biggest mistake is that Li is totally wasted in his role. Had he not been CGI for the majority, it could have been a lot more tense, but it's a special effects movie, so what can you do.But it's still fun, it's just missing a the chemistry between the cast that the first two had.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
23,Aaron1375,Really like the other mummy movies except for the setting.,8,10 August 2008,"Well the setting and the fact Rachel Weiz was replaced. Still, I thought it was a good movie for what it was. Basically, the mindless popcorn flick of the summer where you really have to turn off your brain to have a good time. Though seeing the score here I have to think I am in the minority as far as people liking this one. I compare it to Van Helsing a bit...short on plot, but makes up for it with a lot of action. It passed the time nicely for me. The story, well another mummy has been reawakened. This time in China, a legendary emperor played by Jet Li. Well the mummy is discovered by Brendan Fraser character's son and the O'Conells who were apparently spies or something between mummy movies are sent to China with a rare artifact and of course their on a collision course for adventure and action. Granted, the plot is not all that great, but then when is it ever in these mummy movies? Great initial chase scene, some good action in the mountains and a nice concluding fight at the great wall of China. Like I said this one had loads of action and was pretty well paced, so basically expect a mindless summer movie where you if you sit back and turn off your brain you will enjoy it a bit more. I think this one is not liked as much because people have been getting slightly better fare lately during the summers, which is also a good thing, but I can still appreciate something that does not provoke you to think about it long afterwards.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
24,Wuchakk,"High adventure in China, albeit totally overdone",6,8 December 2019,"In 1946 Rick & Evy (Brendan Fraser & Maria Bello) are bored in their middle age in England and so take an assignment to China where they meet Evelyn's brother (John Hannah) and their son (Luke Ford) who has discovered the tomb of a tyrannical ancient emperor (Jet Li). Unfortunately, there's a secret plot to resurrect the mummified remains of the Emperor and all hell naturally breaks loose. Michelle Yeoh and Isabella Leong are also on hand.""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" (2008) is an overblown action/adventure horror/comedy popcorn blockbuster, just like the first two flicks. It's not as good as ""The Mummy"" (1999), yet it's better than the unabsorbing ""The Mummy Returns"" (2001). Yes, it's overdone like the second one, but the story is more compelling.While it's regrettable that Rachel Weisz opted out of this third film in order to be with her one year-old son, Maria Bello is a solid replacement and actually looks better in tight pants (as she's curvier and therefore more physically appealing).Of course the film's preposterous in the tradition of the previous two and the Indiana Jones flicks. But let's give credit where credit is due: ""Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" bends over backwards to entertain with tombs, priceless artifacts, mummies, Shanghai, the Great Wall, the Himalayas, yetis, Shangri-La, zombies, a three-headed dragon and martial arts.If you can get past the absence of Weisz and embrace Bello (which, let's face it, isn't that hard to do), this is easily the second best of the trilogy. Interestingly, Roger Ebert maintained that it was the best and he ain't no slouch when it comes to appraising pictures, whatever the genre. Yet my wife zeroed-in on the film's flaw, which is the same as the previous flick: It tries too hard. It frantically throws in everything but the kitchen sink and is the lesser for it. (Yetis, seriously?)The movie runs 1 hour, 52 minutes, and was shot in Buckinghamshire, England; Montréal, Québec; and China (Beijing, Shanghai, Inner Mongolia, Tianmo, Heng Dian, Dongguan & Terracotta Warriors Museum, Xi'an, Shaanxi).GRADE: B-",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
25,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,5,5 August 2008,"A friend was curious why I wanted to give this show a chance. The answer is simple, and I will not deny that I sort of enjoyed the free-wheeling, breezy summer action-adventure-comedy with a generous dose of special effects thrown in, which the Mummy and The Mummy Returns offered, together with the great chemistry between Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz and John Hannah. But this installment of Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, came hot on the heels of the Hollywood bandwagon of raiding their own franchises in order to rake in millions around the world, and therefore fell short on many counts.The main creative force behind the Mummy franchise (discounting the spin off of The Scorpion King) is writer-director Stephen Sommers, and this time round, he's handed over the reins to Rob Cohen, who of course is no stranger to action flicks like this, but you know what? He's never done a follow up movie before. He starts franchises, like The Fast and the Furious, and xXx, but never taking it over from someone else. Therefore, whatever original essence and flavour that the earlier movies possessed, became lost in the change at the helm. Even the jokes, usually having John Hannah delivering the bulk of them, seemed contrived, tired and just jarring - oh we need a joke now, cut to John, say something, and cut back to the action.Then, the change in lead actress would have signalled that something was amiss. While this isn't anything new (just ask Christopher Nolan when he replaced Katie Holmes with Maggie Gyllenhaal), it does tell you something that Rachel Weisz had a good reason not to reprise her role, and good for you, girl! Maria Bello was a poor replacement who lacks the great chemistry that Weisz shared with Fraser, and worse, was let down by the storyline. In fact, you can even take out her Eve O'Connell, and you won't miss a thing, not to mention that she now has to share the limelight with 2 other actresses in Michelle Yeoh, and contend with a younger upstart in Isabella Leong.There were plenty other missteps along the way, more noticeably in the Asian casting. While Jet Li got star billing, he had only limited screen time, while his digital double had chosen to do battle with Batman in a bout of who's having the gruff voice of the year. Michelle Yeoh as a witch with magical powers might just stretch it a little, though she does get some justice here when she got to go one on one against Jet, after having her role unceremoniously dumped in their earlier collaboration Fearless. While Isabella Leong primarily fulfilled her flower vase role successfully, Russell Wong given a cameo and even Wu Jing managed to appear for 5 seconds, Anthony Wong recycled his uniform in The Painted Veil for an appearance here, and also recycled his performance in being the quintessential baddie. Yes the role probably had a lot more Asian faces than your usual Hollywood blockbuster, but these are roles that are nothing to shout about, and being so only because the movie is set in Post WWII China.And don't get me started on the story. This marks the 2nd consecutive time that Jet's character got cast in stone, the previous being in The Forbidden Kingdom, and unless he wants to make this a habit, I'd say he better screen his next script properly. His role here is similar to that of The Rock's in The Mummy Returns, so you'll probably be bored by the sense of deja vu, especially when the story develops in familiar ground, like high speed chases through the city at night, and set action pieces in preventing mummy dearest from achieving full power. It took a leaf out of Return of the King, and had CGI armies pitting themselves against each other in one messy lump. Arrows are cool, and the show reminded us again. The effects, while nicely rendered, still felt too tired from its paying homage to whatever had already gone before.If you're a fan of Brendan Fraser, I'd recommend you to go watch him Journey to the Center of the Earth because he disappears into the background here no thanks to the insipid story. Even the 2D print showing here would beat The Mummy hands down in the entertainment department. Unless of course you prefer having to watch something of the same-old, which had woefully lost the magic its predecessors possessed. I guess some Mummies do not deserved to be resurrected.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
26,siderite,"Take Mummy 2, add a little Indiana Jones, dilute it with water",6,12 September 2008,"What is wrong with Jet Lee? How much money can one get for allowing Brendan Frasier to kick their ass?! :)Anyway, the film itself is OK as an adventure. It has special effects, nice landscapes and lots of smart remarks. The plot, however, it ridiculous! There is not one moment where one can relate to any of the characters. What a powerful and compelling performance Arnold Vosloo gave when interpreting the complex role as the mummy in the first two films and what lack of depth of any kind was bestowed on Jet Li's character.Bottom line: it was a fun film for children. That is, if they haven't seen the first two mummy films to make the comparison. Given the general lack of interesting movies nowadays, I guess this has to be a box office success, although the money it makes must have been the sole concern of all involved in making it.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
27,JamesHitchcock,Too Fast and Too Furious,4,20 August 2008,"The original ""Mummy"" film was officially a remake of an old black-and-white movie from 1932, but it, and its sequel ""The Mummy Returns"", essentially copied the formula of the Indiana Jones franchise. Both are adventure series set in the twenties and thirties, both have an archaeologist as the hero and both feature that hero's fight against the forces of evil, both human and supernatural.The third film in the Mummy franchise transfers the action from Egypt to China, presumably to cash in on the Peking Olympics, which opened on the same day. (I know the Communists want me to call it ""Beijing"", which is why I don't). The year is 1946. Alex O'Connor, the young son of Rick and Evelyn from ""The Mummy Returns"", is now an archaeologist in his own right, excavating ancient Chinese tombs, and has discovered the tomb of the notorious Emperor Han. (He is presumably based upon the first Emperor of China, Ch'in Shih Huang-Ti, who created the terracotta army and built the first version of the Great Wall, but Han was the name of the dynasty which succeeded his).The plot is complex and lives up to the exacting standards of realism and verisimilitude set by the first two ""Mummy"" films. We learn that Han and his army were cursed by a sorceress and have spent the last two millennia in suspended animation. Unfortunately, Alex is tricked by a warlord into reviving Han's corpse, and, once reanimated, the ruthless despot, with the aid of his terracotta warriors, sets out to achieve his original ambition of conquering the world, an ambition which was only frustrated the first time around by the curse. Fortunately Alex is able to call upon the assistance of his parents, well versed in the art of frustrating the designs of malevolent mummies, as well as that of the sorceress and her daughter, both surprisingly attractive for women who must be well over 2,000 years old. Alex, clearly a lover of older women, promptly falls in love with the daughter.Rick, played by that rather stolid actor Brendan Fraser, was never an action hero to compare with Harrison Ford's Indy, but the first two films in the series had compensations in the shape of the gorgeous Rachel Weisz as Evelyn and Jonathan, Evelyn's brother, played by John Hannah for laughs as a cowardly and avaricious upper-class twit. The first mistake made by the producers of ""Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" was failing to secure Rachel's services as Evelyn for this film. (Apparently she declined after taking one look at the script, and I cannot say I blame her). Her replacement, Maria Bello, cannot hold a candle to her in terms of looks, acting ability or charisma. Her attempt at British accent was, to say the least, inadequate. At times I wondered if the storyline had been changed to make Evelyn an American. Luke Ford's Alex seems even more stolid than his screen father and Jonathan seems to have less to do here than he had in the first two films.The second mistake the producers made was to replace Stephen Sommers as director with Rob Cohen. Mr Cohen once made a film called ""The Fast and the Furious"", a title which might serve equally well for ""Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"". His hectic and exhausting direction lacks Sommers's lightness of touch; the effect is similar to being trapped on a two-hour roller-coaster. The special effects, which include the warriors coming back to life and the shape-shifting Emperor transforming himself into various noxious creatures, are well done in themselves, but the plot seems like little more than an excuse to get from one special effect to the next.The dialogue is undistinguished and the attempts at wit, like Jonathan's line about ""the yak yakked"", generally fall flat. (In any case, Jonathan is supposed to be British, and in British slang the verb ""to yak"" means to talk, especially foolishly or excessively. It does not mean ""to vomit"").The third mistake the producers are apparently intent on committing is making a fourth episode in the series; Jonathan's line about moving to Peru certainly is a hint in this direction. The Mummy III"" is definitely one episode too far. I doubt if ""The Mummy IV"" would be any better. 4/10",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
28,Smells_Like_Cheese,Sadly disappointing,5,4 August 2008,"I do have a question, what ever happened to the slow walking lame Egyptian mummies? I mean, as silly as they are, they're still entertaining. Now we have The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, I loved The Mummy, The Mummy Returns, it was watchable, but this one was just an excuse to make some quick cash. I was actually looking forward to seeing this movie, I got the opportunity to see it today, I was excited, but unfortunately, we now have Chinese mummies that can do anything that will fit into the CGI budget. Another disappointment was the recasting of Evelyn, I know Rachel Weisz turned this script down, but she was seriously needed, Maria Bella, who is a decent actress, actually made Evie a very flat character and not as enjoyable. Then not only that, but we have Brendan and Maria who do look incredibly good for their age, they have a 20 year old son in the movie? This story was a waste of time and money.The Emperor of China wanted to rule the entire world, but when a Chinese witch curses him and his army, he is put to sleep for thousands of years. Rick and Evie are now retired and have lost the spark in their relationship, but when they are asked to go to Shanghai to deliver a small little ball, they bump into their son who has discovered the Emperor. Rick and Evie are forced to wake the mummy by his followers. Now the whole family with Jonathan and the protector who was supposed to keep the emperor from rising, must destroy the Emperor or he will take over the entire world.The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor has some OK moments, I loved the beginning story and the ending battle scene is held pretty strong, it's worth the look for that, but I would say this is more of a rental. It's just a sad disappointment, considering how much better it could have been. The one liners were too cheesy and we have three headed dragons, karate kicking abdominal snow men, why not just go all the way and have leprechauns with machine guns? That's how out of control the CGI effects are. Luke Ford makes Brandon Fraiser look like Marlon Brando with his acting and the love story between him and the protector girl was useless.

30,Buddy-51,A mummy in need of re-wrapping,4,1 August 2008,"The antagonist may be different, but it's still the same old nonsense in ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,"" the third installment in the series that began with ""The Mummy"" in 1999 and continued with ""The Mummy Returns"" two years later. Brendan Fraser revives his role as Rick O'Connell, a sort of poverty-program Indiana Jones who, in this edition, finds himself trying to prevent an ancient Chinese king (Jet Li) from resurrecting an army of invincible terra cotta warriors and taking over the world. Joining Rick in this mission are his wife, Evelyn (Maria Bello), and their too-big-for-his-britches archaeologist son, Alex (Luke Ford).While watching this latest ""Mummy"" adventure, I began to suspect that writers Alfred Gough and Miles Milnar simply tossed everything they could think of into the mix in the hope that something at least halfway decent might ultimately come out of it. That may explain why the story includes a side trip to Shangri-La, an assortment of friendly abominable snow creatures, an ancient Chinese palace that is a veritable funhouse of Rube Goldberg contraptions, two clashing armies of the undead, weak helpings of humor and sentiment, and action sequences that are far more hectic than they are exciting. Goodness knows, one doesn't go into one of these ""Mummy"" extravaganzas expecting a ""Lord of the Rings"" or a ""Lawrence of Arabia."" But even the most fanciful of adventures needs an intriguing storyline and a compelling cast of characters to counterbalance all those freakishly pumped-up and excessive special effects.A few words of praise should at least go to Simon Duggan for his richly-hued cinematography and to Nigel Phelps for his equally impressive production design.But as directed by Rob Cohen, ""Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" turns out to be all busyness and very little fun.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
31,thesar-2,Jet's Landing Delayed,4,6 July 2013,"Some sequels should not be made. Sure, it's all about the money – and this is no exception.The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor had no reason to be made other than money. Sure, they finally increased the budget (or talent) on special effects – the previous installments were jokes in regards to FX. But, this one was just overkill.And, like the other unnecessary Lethal Weapon 4, Jet Li appears in both movies for about two minutes and yet, gets top billing. Now, I like Li. Love his action, frame and composure. It's just too bad he's so underused here. I guess, they thought the general public loved how The Rock was CGI'd for roughly 2 minutes in Mummy 2 and the audience – stupidly – wanted more of that.By now, it appears I hated this movie. Not at all. In fact, it's mucho better than #2, even without the title character (the ACTUAL Mummy from #s 1-2) making an appearance. But, it's so incredibly excessive in the series, that I just don't care where this movie lands when it reaches its conclusion.Basically, series headliner, Brendan Fraser's Rick and (newly – and poorly casted Maria Bello as) Evy are retired, but their dumb son, Alex, is trying to mimic Indiana Jones and find the lost Chinese dictator. Naturally, the monster comes back alive and it's up to Rick, Evy, Alex and some pitiful-CGI Yeti to thwart (another poor CGI creation in the form of) Jet Li's Emperor.If you liked the first two, this might make you feel all nostalgic, especially with the silly humor and sometimes terrible graphics. But, new comers, please just revisit the fantastic Indiana Jones chapters that this one mocks. Hell, even National Treasure films were better. Watch those instead.Even when not a complete waste, it's not recommended.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
32,bensonmum2,"""You guys are like mummy magnets!""",3,3 August 2008,"I caught The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor with the family this past Friday night and couldn't be more underwhelmed by the experience. I'm not much of a fan of the first two Brendan Fraser mummy movies, but with Jet Li in the cast I was actually looking forward to this one. I honestly didn't expect much more than a mindless action movie. But what I wasn't expecting was something quite this vapid. Bigger and louder with more explosions isn't always a good thing. The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor went beyond being mindless to the point it began to insult my intelligence. The tissue paper thin plot (which I'm not going to bother to even go into) seems as if it were made up on the spot and merely serves to string together a series of action set pieces. And there is little to no attempt made at character development. If you aren't familiar with the other movies in the series, I bet you'd be hard pressed to know anything about Brendan Fraser's character. And whose bright idea was it to have Luke Ford play Fraser's son? Was he born when Fraser's character was about 12 or something? Just one of the many examples I could cite of things that really bothered me about The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.Despite what I've written so far, the movie isn't a total waste. Some of the action set pieces really do work despite the idiocy surrounding them. For example, my single favorite scene in the film is when Jet Li faces off with Michelle Yeoh. It's magical! Unfortunately, that scene only lasts for a minute or so and we're back to the action by-the-numbers nonsense.Finally, I feel the need to mention the opening 10 or so minutes that provide a back-story for the Dragon Emperor and many of the events to come. That looks like it might have been an interesting and intelligent movie. I'd pay to see that story fleshed out. What I won't pay for, however, is anymore of these Gawd awful mummy movies.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

34,bowmanblue,Better on a second viewing,6,14 January 2015,"I'm writing this review after sitting through the third instalment of the popular 'Mummy' franchise. Basically, on my first viewing I didn't really like it. In fact... I couldn't really tell you anything that had happened up until I'd watched it through for the second time, so it was basically like watching it fresh. However, I am glad I gave it a second chance.Let's get this out the way first... No, it's definitely not as good as the first and not even as good as the second, but it is watchable.I loved the first 'Mummy' film. Granted it will never be remembered as a 'cinema classic,' but it was the perfect blend of fun and silliness that all the family could enjoy on a Saturday afternoon. The second outing was okay, not as good – a little formulaic, but okay. Here, the cracks to show, but it does pick up enough in the second half to warrant at least being talked about alongside its two predecessors.The most noticeable thing about 'Part III' is that Rachel Weisz is absent. Her role has gone to Maria Bello. And, sadly, Bello doesn't seem that comfortable stepping into someone else's – well established – shoes. Therefore, the chemistry between she and Brendan Fraser does suffer. As does their combined chemistry with their (now grown up) son, Alex. Instead of our old Mummy (now finally dead, obviously) we have Jet Li – who is sort of a martial arts expert mummy who also just so happens to want to take over the world.Perhaps its major drawback is the plot. It's basically the same as the previous two, only with some of the cast missing and the ones who remain looking tired. John Hannah is a welcome return, he still maintains his natural banter with Brendan Fraser which is a nice respite from the similarities.However, for all its – many – faults, I couldn't help but enjoy the second half. Yes, it's a rehash, but it's a fun rehash. The yetis are cool and the final battle is probably the best out of the three films. So, as long as you know what you're letting yourself in for, i.e. that it's not as good as the first two, you should find it an okay little distraction. If you've never seen any of the Mummy's offerings, it's probably best to start with the first and see if you enjoy it before dabbling with parts II and III.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
35,MLDinTN,slightly better than the second Mummy,4,3 August 2009,"I really liked the first Mummy. I thought it was witty and mummy special effects were good. I hated the second film; I thought it had one of the worst plots of all time. I thought this movie was a little better than the second one. One of the problems with any sequel to movies like this is the plot is pretty much the same. They use the same humor and it seems the special effects just keep getting worse because the director puts in more and more silly/ outlandish creatures and stunts. For example, yeti come to the rescue??? But one of the worst features of this movie is they had to get another actress to play Evie. Rachel Weiz was great in the role and they chose a non-Brit to be her replacement. Sorry, Maria Bello just doesn't cut it as a witty, British beauty. It is so easy to tell her accent is so fake. She never gets it right.FINAL VERDICT: This movie is geared for those that like action no matter how worthless the plot is.

Yes, the movie did have some flaws but I have seen movies that suck big time(none of them reviewed) such as Jet Li's Hero. Brendan Fraser returns as Rick O'Connell. This time he and his wife Evy are forced out of retirement to China where they accidentally released an immortal king who wants to enslave the world. The O'Connells are joined by Jonathan, Alex, and two immortal ladies who serve as protector of the Chinese mummies.Pros: Brendan Fraser did a good job a third time around. I liked all the actors except Maria Bello. The special effects are very good. They should be Oscar-nominated. I liked the music composed by Randy Edelman. There are great action scenes especially between Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh. Cons: Where the heck is Rachel Weisz? She is the only person who should play Evy. Maria Bello disgraced Evy's character for generations to come. Did you know that Brendan Fraser and Luke Ford look almost the same age? I did wish that Oded Fehr appeared at least for a little while.Overall, this is a good movie. But, I should have rated this a 5 or 6 because of the cons I listed. I have great respect for the Mummy series and that's why I rate this film 8/10.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

38,tabuno,Exciting and Creative Action Film with Flaws,8,20 January 2019,"3 August 2008. While this third Mummy movie isn't a classic nor the greatest, the producer, director can be complimented for taking some big risks and introducing an improved action movie that pushes the envelope while allowing some significant flaws to creep in. This usually and mostly amazing, dazzling chase and action sequences has an edge, a bite that is noticeably different and captivating than most other action-thrillers. Unfortunately, the sometimes stereotypical and predicable as well as illogical sequences almost intrude to the point of irritation, but not quite. The rich and sometimes overdone humor works and is nicely balanced with some darker moments. Overall, this is enjoyable and compelling movie with some excellent new fireworks. As an aside, Mario Bello who is the new Evelyn O'Connell character starred along with William C. Macy in The Cooler (2003) whose main setting was the Shangri La Casino in Las Vegas in an interesting coincidence to the Mummy's storyline where Brendan Fraser and Mario Bello go in search of Shangri La and their sidekick, John Hannah, even goes so far as mentioning turning Shangri La into a casino.

The Mummy (1999) is better OK. The Mummy returns it also better. But real is not an awful movie. For from it. This is better then The Mummy (1932). It very scary and has a lot action. Brendan Fraser has real interesting. Jet Li play a guy who come back from the dead and can turn into a three headed dragon. And people are worked because some also other then Rachel Weisz played Evelyn the pretty girl in the movie. Big deal. The actors and writes and director. And every one also in the cast and crew worked real hard and did really good job. Rachel Weisz is good actress. But do you no what so is Maria Bello. Brendan Fraser and Jet Li are also great actors. This is not the first movie made without Rachel Weisz and will not be the last. This one of the best horror movies from 2008.,The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
40,briancham1994,Completely disappointing,5,11 August 2020,"Coming after the first two Mummy films, this one was a total let down.

However, it completely squanders it through silly special effects, yeti, forced romance and more. What a disaster.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
41,johnnyboyz,"I don't think any of us ever thought we'd say it, but: ""come back Stephen Sommers - all is forgiven!""",4,12 October 2011,"I don't think The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is the sort of film people especially enjoy ripping on, but with a title like that and that fact it is just plain rubbish, and really rather goofy rubbish, it's difficult not to get ever-so-slightly wound up at the sheer, unhinged stupidity of the project. I think any film in which a character gets their ""flame grilled ass spanked""; is later covered in yak vomit and sees one of their allies, amidst fighting the apocalypse and desperately striving to save the world, have a discussion with their son about sex education just prior to encountering some American Football playing Yetis, is looking for a bruising. Oh yeah, the Yetis - the last time any of us saw a Yeti in a movie must have been 2002's Monster's Inc., a delightful little animation doing more in ten minutes of its ninety minute runtime than this does in its entire showing. In that movie, the CGI Yeti's presence was funny and original - the film taking this idea that a Yeti could exist in our world and making a joke about it that was good fun. Here, all director Rob Cohen can do is have them rear up and hit people.Things have moved on and times have changed in the O'Connell household; it is now the 1940's, and Brendan Fraser's Rick, as well as his wife Evelyn, (Bello, replacing Weisz) are self-consciously ageing. Rick practises fishing in a bid to find something to amuse himself during retirement, but after having earned your corn saving the world and fighting abroad with foreign armies uncovering things no man has seen in centuries, what do you do to keep yourself occupied at age fifty-plus? Over in Shanghai, Evelyn's brother Jonathan (Hannah) is busy running what looks like the Obi-Wan club from The Temple of Doom, whereas propping up the family is their son Alex (Ford), now a fully rounded action hero like his Dad after growing out of infant beginnings in the last film. Oh, and he's lost that accent - sporting an American one now as well as a reputation for being a bit of a rebel. Alex is the franchise's future; there for those in the audience new to the series, the existing O'Connell's of Rick and Evelyn present for the rest of us – so, anybody over the age of about ........twenty-one. With Rick struggling with his newfound hobby; Evelyn suffering writer's block as she works on a new work of 'fiction' based on romps-past and their love life all but dead, if only there was some way to fix all three and instill a bit of adventure back into their lives....Hark, for hundreds of years ago, a bored looking Jet Li playing the titular emperor, named Han, employs the services of Michelle Yeoh's witch, Zi Yuan, to use her skills in casting immortality upon him. She does so, with some complications Han did not envisage, and the tyrant is actually killed with the spell before being buried, thus seeing the world saved of him: for now. At a dig site in China years later, a bunch of faceless Chinese assistants are killed off so that Alex and a stuffy British archaeologist may live on and discover him. They inadvertently awaken after getting the better of those dastardly traps, but why would there be traps in the tomb? You'd think he'd perhaps want to be found. Perhaps they were put there over the years by this entries' equivalent to the Medjai, a group of Chinese people looking to keep the Emperor and his terracotta army silent - I forget. Han rises, as do his army, and the world is threatened once again.Preplotting where it is the film ventures from here is no complicated feat. Along the way, there are allies and foils and double agents - none of being it particularly interesting and most of it particularly soul destroying if one thinks of 1999's The Mummy with any degree of nostalgic fondness. Gone are the edges that first film had, that romping; frolicking and often comedic sensibility which kept it grounded and a good crack, blending uneasily with frank and perturbing scenes involving Vosloo's character which did enough to keep a sense of danger prominent and the film 'adult' enough without necessarily making it a freak-show. The character stuff is equally stagnant. A lot is made out of the fact the family unit are dysfunctional and troubled when trying to work as one, the mid-life crises Alex's parents face, and their disconnection from their son, goes on to be painstakingly healed; as is the rift in Alex's persona when it's established he lives an ill-judged and often wayward lifestyle, the encountering of a female Chinese ally in this film acting as the key to setting that particular record straight.The franchise began life as a 'remake' of a 1930's Universal horror studio picture, updating it into an Indiana Jones-esque romp which flashed wildly from dumbo, teen-aged orientated, spectacle-imbued kicks to content rather often unnerving, but did the job. The sequel, 2001's The Mummy Returns, was an unnecessary cash-in trying to up-stakes and go above the original without ever actually going anywhere at all. Here, the leap from Ancient Egypt to a 3rd century Chinese dynasty in order to what studio executives usually classify as ""taking the franchise in new directions"" feels about as smooth as bathing with a piece of sandpaper instead of a wet flannel. Perhaps we're being too harsh, since there is one link between the two: the fact that The Pyramids and The Great Wall of China ARE both magnificent feats of architecture - admittedly, it does has this fact going for it in the argument against this being a ham-fisted cash in devoid of wit and creativity, but that and that alone.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
42,filipemanuelneto,A movie made for the box office and not for the quality.,2,20 April 2017,"This is the third and last movie of ""The Mummy"" trilogy. It had a big budget and kept (at least) one of the actors from the previous films (Brendan Fraser) but it cut with everything that had been done before, with a new cast and a story set in China instead of Egypt. The plot has moments of solidity in which it promises good entertainment, but everything falls apart due to the poor development of the story and poor work of the director and the generality of the actors. The best is undoubtedly sets and an excellent cinematography, but this isn't enough to make it good. Jet Li is the best actor here, achieving a very strong performance, but I don't know how much he has benefited with the weak participation of the remaining cast. Even Fraser was far from what we saw in two previous films! The film is loaded with poor quality CGI, too evident to deserve any credibility. Soundtrack is acceptable but doesn't have brilliance and doesn't stay in the ear. The film tries to maintain usual humorous comic strips we've seen in the previous two films, but it's such a weak humor that it's not funny, just stupid.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

But this is not how to do it. An utter mess is the only way to describe the execution. Our beloved archaeologists and treasure hunters have been tasked with one final mission, to deliver the ""Eye of Shangri-la"" to China. Alas, a faction of devoted soldiers wish to resurrect their lost emperor from the dead...and so we have a ""Mummy"" movie. I have too many gripes with this, so let me get the positives out of the way. Plenty of mindless action, Brendan Fraser is so damn likeable (I seriously miss him...), good father and son onscreen chemistry and Michelle Yeoh is always a plus. Those are the four points that this film earns. Now...onto the negatives! I noticed a small little detail that was missing...Rachel Weisz. Maria Bello, I'm sorry, you did your best but Weisz just cannot be replaced. Jet Li was wasted and had no charisma. The script was completely mediocre where the humour was injected into every other line, as if I was watching a classic 70s adventure film. Know your current audience Gough and Millar, because this sucked and was hugely unfunny. Rachel Weisz isn't in this. The visual effects for the most part were average, however the first use of it was horrendous. You know the scene...Jet Li melting and solidifying into a terracotta statue. Urghhh was painful to watch. Blowing up an ancient Tibetan monastery as a 'Plan B' is immoral and culturally despicable (someone give me a Nobel Peace prize!). Rachel Weisz isn't in this. Yetis? Really...YETIS!? We're going there are we? Might as well have a three headed dragon whilst we're at it...oh...never mind. You're wondering what I'm getting at right?

47,funkyfry,fun third installment in the series,6,1 September 2008,"I wasn't looking for or expecting this to be any kind of serious movie, since I've seen the first two already. The film met my expectations and in some ways exceeded them. It's just as much fun in terms of the comedy and action as the first one, far exceeding the tepid sequel. Largely that's thanks to the superior direction of action movie veteran Rob Cohen.The third film does somewhat improbably ask us to believe that Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and Evelyn O'Connell (Mario Bello) have already aged enough to have a full grown son who can take part in their adventures (Luke Ford). In that sense it immediately reminds one of the early summer's hit ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."" But to be honest I liked this movie better than the mediocre Indy entry. I think Spielberg has done at least one too many of those, and in this case Cohen brought a bit of freshness to the series. I found Ford more interesting than Shia LaBouef in the new Indy movie as well in the similar role. Jet Li as a new Asian mummy brought a difference in style from what we saw in the other two films. I just thought that the images of the terra-kotta mummy warriors was more compelling and unique than whatever the other ""Mummy"" sequels offered. Also I greatly appreciate the absence of ""The Rock"" or Dwayne Johnson or whatever he calls himself these days. This one felt a lot more breezy and wasn't weighed down as much by the demands of the characters and genre. A lot more of the series regulars were here too than I expected; it was fun to see John Hannah back in his recurring role as the brother-in-law comedy relief.This movie is just action product, and it doesn't have anything really to say. But it also doesn't pretend to have anything to say, which is a plus in my book. It offers nothing more and nothing less than stylish action-fantasy in the pulp action mode. The movie is somewhat beneath Maria Bello's talent but right in Fraser's prime territory. Personally I really enjoy Brendan Fraser, I think he uses his ""lightweight"" screen persona to good effect. He is the natural heir to the throne of people like John Agar and Peter Graves, playing a heavily self-serious character with a light touch that makes the thing come off effortless on screen.For those who know what they're getting into, this is going to be very satisfying. There's a lot of laughs, quite a bit of predictable but compelling action, and a lot of exciting effects.

48,FiendishDramaturgy,Enjoyable In Spite Of Bad Reviews,7,6 September 2008,"Historically speaking, this era was fraught with war and difficulties. Chiang Kai-Shek's Kuomintang regime was defending its position against the insurgent Chinese communists and there were many smaller factions vying for position, should either side fail.Out of that time of uncertainty and unrest, this story is woven. But this story, written lovingly by Alfred Gough & Miles Millar, delivers a breathtaking, epic tale of the ruthless Emperor Han and his journey to forgiveness and redemption...or self destruction. I like the story.Some have reported experiencing difficulties accepting Maria Bello as Evelyn O'Connell, but I must say...although I am a huge fan of Rachel Weisz, I found Ms. Bello's performance delightful. I enjoyed the story, the action, and flow, the performances, and the overall presentation of the finished product.Jet Li? He was the one piece of perfection this movie had to offer. He has grown exponentially as an actor, and it really shows here.All in all? It appealed to the child in me, the adult I've become, and the critical eye I've developed over time.

Brendon Fraser brought a lot to it as the humorous adventurer Rick O'Connell, so did Rachel Weisz as his wife. Now for the third one, while watching this one, it becomes clear that it was the incredible CGI effects that pretty becomes the whole movie, because the acting falls on a dead plate. Brendon Fraser looks amazingly bored this time around, maybe he had nothing better to do, or maybe he missed Rachel Weisz. Maria Bello is a great actress, but she is a terrible shoe in Rachel Weisz. And I didn't buy Luke Ford(who looks a young Nick Nolte) as Frasers son in the movie, they look more brothers, especially Frasers character has appeared to have not aged a day since the last two mummy films.

I mean, they should have known, rarely do franchises or TV series survive when a key character is replaced by a new actor.James Bond and Bewitched are the only two examples I can really think of. Other than than the quality sort of plummets. Audiences don't except it.It would have been better just to write her character out.But then again, it doesn't seem like a Mummy movie without Egypt, or even the Mummy.So here you have a film with one of the main cast members replaced, another removed entirely, and the familiar setting totally removed. Of course people aren't going to like it.And they didn't. It totally killed the series.So now they are rebooting it and too soon. We can only hope they redo it entirely and shoot for a totally different Mummy movie, maybe a return to horror. just to distance from the reboot/remake"" feel...but we already know they won't.The action and the humor are still there, but the changes make you feel like it's a cheap copy. It feels like an after-market Mummy film.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
51,freemantle_uk,A Great Example...,3,7 July 2009,"...of a movie franchise that is too successful for its own good. The first film was a decent, fun romp, nothing specular but it wasn't setting itself out to be high art. The Second was a run in the mill sequel and nothing that good. The Mummy Returns even set up a spin for the Scorpion King which was a pet project for the Rock and even that had a straight to DVD sequel which was rubbish.2000 years before the main events of the film, Han (Jet Li) became the emperor of China by force. He sets out to control the country, the elements and even overcome death. Han is able to recruit the help of a witch, Zi Yuan (Michelle Yeoh) to become immortal. Han falls in love with Zi Yuan, but she is in love with General Ming (Russell Wong). After Zi Yuan does make Han immortal, he betrays her by killing Ming and attempts to kill her, but Zi Yuan being a clever woman puts a curse on Han and his army, turning them into terracotta. Fast Forward to 1946. Alex O'Connell (Luke Ford) is now a young adult and a expert in Chinese history and archaeology. In Western China his team finds the Terracotta Army (see where we're going). This becomes major news very quickly and he becomes famous in Shanghai. In England Rick and Evelyn (Brandon Fraser and Maria Bello) are living in retirement. Evelyn has become a successful author and very rich. But both bored with live and quickly take up an offer from the Foreign Office to return the Eye Of Shangri-La to China. When they arrive in China they are surprised that their son has dropped out of university and living the high life. Also in China they are forces at work to bring Emperor Han back to live and rebuild China. The ride is one to stop Han from regaining his power.They are many problems with the film, from writing, direction and acting. The story itself is just a carbon copy of the Mummy, but this time set in China. Jet Li is now the mummy and Oded Fehr's role is replaced with Michelle Yeoh. The beginning is even the same as the first two. It hardly anything original. The jokes are poor, John Hannah doesn't have a lot to work with. They are plot holes and just things done just to move the plot or action along, regardless of logic, e.g. the Yetis. What really surprising is the 'writers' of the film wrote the brilliant Spider-man 2. They must have done the for the money and the studio didn't bother asking for a second draft. Finally, the setting of the film is China, why? China was not known for mummification and most films set with Mummies are in Egypt. Even if a change of location was needed, why not South America, North America, Africa or the Middle East? The only reason why is because of the market China offers.The director has been changed from the workmanlike Stephen Sommers to the workmanlike Rob Cohen. The Mummy was Sommers' baby and he at least made the first one fun. Cohen is a hack who only made one good film, Dragon: the Bruce Lee Story. He makes poor casting choices, he can't handle the story, the CGI was poor, he over edits and what is really bad, for a man who made a decent martial arts film and has Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh, directs a terrible first between the two. Most of the time Emperor Han is a CGI creature, so why bother casting Jet Li? Finally Rob Cohen is an unusual choice because he doesn't normally do family films, he film are normally aimed at young men who just action films like Dragon, the Fast and the Furious, xXx and Stealth. It's a sad state of a affairs when you are missing Stephen Sommers.Finally the acting. Rachel Weisz was smart enough to see the script was a dub and rejected her role. Maria Bello replaces her. She was very good in A History of Violence, but poor in this, unable to do a decent English accent. Brandon Fraser had to do the film because of his contract, and it shows, his heart wasn't in the film. He was event side-lined for Luke Ford, an Australian actor who can't act. Plothole hear are how can Brandon Fraser play Luke Ford's dad when they look like cousins and how does Alex O'Connell turn from English in the Mummy Returns to American in Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh are both wasted and both are known for doing better work such as Kiss of the Dragon, Fearless, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Tomorrow Never Dies and Sunshine. They are giants of Asian cinema. Finally they is Isabella Leong, an actress from Macau. She is easy on the eye but poor with acting talent. I hope this was just her first English language role and she could improve.Everyone knows that the Mummy series is Indiana Jones lite, lacking Steven Spielberg's and George Lucas' magic touch. This was just a cast in because of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (which was poor anyway). Just watch the original Indy films and the Mummy.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
52,ebiros2,Could have been better,6,17 April 2009,"Production of this movie somehow didn't work out well. First of all, this movie just had bad script. Story was bad, each scene lacked central focus, and had characters who you could care less about. One big mistake in casting was Maria Bello. She killed the flow of the movie. I was thinking, this is the actress that replaced Rachel Weisz ? But even if Rachel was playing the role, I don't think she would have been able to save the bad script. She was smart to turn down the role. Jet Li's acting was terrible. Even I could've done his part.Cinematography was also pretty bad. I don't know what kind of post processing tools they're using, but I've seen this kind of harsh looking effects where edges looks jagged, and textures all washed out in movies like MI III too, so they must be using the same tool (or an operator that uses the tool in this way). They should study beautiful cinematography of films like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (one thing director Ang Lee is very good at is capturing beautiful scenes).Good in this movie was Michelle Yeoh, and Isabella Leong. Michelle Yeoh's acting had lot of believability to it and Isabella Leong was kicking ass with her moves. Anthony Wong who played the Chinese general was also believable. Luke Ford, didn't bring much to the character, but was putting in serious efforts. Rest of the guys, I don't think believed the part they were playing.Story lacked intrigue of the first two Mummy movies. The antagonist had character in the first two, where the Dragon Emperor in this one had none. In this movie, the antagonist was the CG special effects.So, the movie failed to be the worthy successor in the series that was entertaining and fun to watch.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
53,dfranzen70,"Tepid, like swirling water in a descending drain.",6,23 January 2009,"The third Mummy film is like that one guy in the office who always speaks loudly without saying anything, thus masking his lack of knowledge with the effective weapon of volume. The Mummy: The Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, is silly, bloated nonsense that's helped in no small amount by excellent special effects, allowing it to (barely) overcome dull characters and an illogical plot.The Mummy movies are essentially Indiana Jones wannabes, but the reason they've succeeded to this point is that their plots, although simplistic, made a lick of a sense, and the lead characters were engaging. It's not always the case in this third movie in the series; rather than a storyline driving the effects, it's the other way around, and it's noticeable. That, added to the lack of chemistry between Brendan Fraser (playing Rick O'Connell) and Maria Bello (playing Evelyn O'Connell) makes this more of a miss than a hit.Actually, calling it a lack of chemistry isn't entirely fair. Fraser and Bello, replacing Rachel Weisz are okay together, but Bello isn't entirely believable. The transition from Weisz to Bello just isn't seamless; when you look at Evelyn you can't help but notice she's not Rachel Weisz. Bello's Evelyn seems, at times, to be more simpering and matronal than Weisz's ever was, but part of that has to do with the progression of the lead characters: they met in the first movie and had a kid for the second movie, and now their intraconflict has to do with their now-grown (!) son, and it's a weak conflict.And that's the second problem with the movie. Apparently, the producers felt that Rick and Evvie shouldn't be toting a tot around the world - as they did in the second movie - so they moved the kid's age up to early twenties instead. Trouble is, the last movie was only seven years ago, when little Alex was in single digits. Suddenly, he's all grown up. Fraser looks the same, though, making it all a tad incongruous.The plot? Oh, something about an evil Chinese emperor-mummy being raised so he can restore China to its rightful throne of the most awesomest country in the universe, or something. Seems this emperor (played by Jet Li), seeking immortality, was instead cursed by a double-crossed witch (played by Michelle Yeoh), turning him and his entire army into terra cotta. (The terra-cotta-warriors part is based on the real-life Qin Dynasty, believe it or not.) Emperor gets raised, the O'Connells are contrivably involved, and mayhem occurs.Highlights include the sweeping cinematography (by Simon Duggan), typical of the Mummy films, and the work of the Asian actresses - Yeoh as the immortal witch and Isabella Leong as her immortal daughter, who naturally falls for Alex O'Connell (played by Aussie Luke Ford). And the action sequences are fun to watch, particularly the climactic standoff at the temple at Shangri-La.But overall, this feels like unmemorable and wasted time. If this had made money (it didn't quite recoup its $145 million price tag), the idea was that Alex would have taken over the series, since star Fraser's three-film commitment is complete. Truth is, while Fraser's okay in the lead, he doesn't bring anything extra to the table - he's just a generic action guy. In fact, he's a generic action guy who makes a lot of these exact movies, like Journey to the Center of the Earth, as if it were some calculated studio plan to make him into an A-lister who can open action movies, to use industry parlance.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
54,jimbo-53-186511,Most of the fun and charm offered in the first two films has all but disappeared by this point,4,1 July 2017,"Centuries ago, a witch Zi Yuan (Michelle Yeoh) puts a curse on an evil emperor (Jet Li) for killing the man that she loved. Several hundred years later Alex O'Connell (Luke Ford) discovers the mummified body of the Emperor and unwittingly leads to the Emperor being resurrected after he is stabbed in the back by his close friend Professor Wilson. Alex's parents arrive in China with the Shangri-La (a precious stone) which they intend to hand back to the Chinese. However, General Yang manages to get the stone from the O'Connells and begins the process of resurrecting the Emperor and his army; the consequences of which will have a catastrophic effect on humanity...The first question that ran through my mind when this film started was where was Rachel Weisz? There are conflicting stories according to IMDb trivia explaining her absence from this film; one being that she didn't want to be away from her son for several months during filming in China or two that she didn't like the script... Hmmm I wonder which was the real reason? As one other reviewer rightly stated it's hard to believe that Rachel Weisz would be missed from this franchise(until you watch this film). Maria Bello does try her hardest, but she isn't as good an actress as Weisz and her chemistry with Fraser is rather poor. This has a knock-on-effect with Fraser who sadly seems rather ill-at-ease in this film. Whenever I watched him here he looked uncomfortable and rather embarrassed and you're left wondering if he thought to himself ""Hell maybe I should have bailed with Rachel"". The performances are a big problem here and another issue lies with Luke Ford's portrayal of the O'Connell's son. Rather than just being his own character it felt like he was trying to emulate Brendan Fraser in the first two films, but he has neither the screen presence or the acting ability to carry this off. The Asian members of the cast fare much better with the likes of Yeoh and Leong putting in strong performances and Jet Li was good in the non-CGI aspects of the film.The only person who seemed to keep in spirit with the original films was John Hannah who managed to make a lot of this film more enjoyable than it has any right to be - although even he has become less funny with each passing film.I would only recommend this film if you absolutely loved the first two films because in this film the weaker aspects from the first two films are magnified much more. It's not as fun to watch as the first two films, not as charming, and not as entertaining. In fact, the kindest thing I can say about it is that it was, at least, slightly better than The Scorpion King.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
55,sauravjoshi85,Nothing new and exciting!!,4,5 May 2021,"The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is an action, adventure, fantasy movie directed by Rob Cohen and stars Brendan Fraser, Jet Li, Maria Bello, John Hannah, Luke Ford, Isabella Leong and Michelle Yeoh.Alex O'Connell the son of Rick and Evy O'Connell unearths and accidentally resurrects a mummy but this time the location is China.The movie is nothing but just a cocktail of previous two movies with similar plot and similar execution and the only difference is that this time the location is Eastern part of Asia. The concept of the movie is awful and the location setting is terrible.Screenplay of the movie is clichéd and apart from very few funny one liners and funny scenes nothing is much exciting, John Hannah who was great in first part and decent in second part was also a disappointment, it seems that he is not been over from the hangover from the previous two movies. Brendan Fraser were decent and Maria Bello was purely disappointment. Jet Li was impressive in the role of Emperor, Michelle Yeoh is been wasted. Luke Ford and Isabella Leong also weren't impressive.CGI of the movie is decent to good and barring few scenes is particularly good. Climax of the movie is predictable and doesn't excites.Overall the movie is major disappointment and I would rather wish that the mummy should've been kept buried in the tomb instead of serving the stale dish. Please watch only if you are a die hard fan of mummy series for others there is nothing new, fresh and exciting in this movie.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
56,3xHCCH,"Now, I Really Missed Rachel Weisz In This One!",5,31 July 2008,"I really like the Mummy series for its epic action, sense of humor and great special effects. I was very excited when I started seeing teasers for this sequel to be shown in July, mostly because it was quite unexpected.This movie has all the required elements of epic action, sense of humor and great special effects. Of course there is still the swashbuckling hero Rick O'Connell played in grand style by Brendan Fraser. He undoubtedly has this action-comedy genre sewn up right in his alley. John Hannah is still around playing his brother-in-law, Jonathan, in his old annoying manner.For the new stuff, the setting shift to China as the titular ""Mummy"" now refers to an ancient Chinese emperor who desired immortality, played by Jet Li (who really personified his anti-hero role with relish here). The emperor sought the help of a ""witch"" (played with much bravado by Michelle Yeoh), with whom he gets attracted to. However, the witch fell in love with his main general (played by Russell Wong, whom you'd wonder why he isn't getting more breaks in Hollywood). From hence starts the conflict and the resultant curse on which the movie stands.The requisite martial arts you would expect in a movie set in China are of course in full play. Very well choreographed, especially that thrilling sword fight between Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh. The exciting action sequences inside the booby-trapped lost tomb, the truck and chariot (!) chase in the streets of Shanghai and the final fight sequence with the ""Mummy"" are all executed very well as in the two previous installments.But then there are the drawbacks that for me pulls this one down to a five star rating. The quality of the spoken Mandarin is at times unintelligible. However, the major beef involves what for me are severely miscast actors.The actor who plays the now college-aged son of the O'Connells, Alex, looks too mature to be the son of Brendan Fraser. I just checked to see that the actor Luke Ford was born in 1981, but he looked older than that, so it was a bit of a stretch to believe that he is Brendan's son. Furthermore, he also does not act like a son, but more like Brendan's younger brother.But the worst and damaging mistake was the decision to cast Maria Bello in the beloved role of Evelyn O'Connell, which is wholly owned by the more beautiful and credible Rachel Weisz. I felt absolutely NO chemistry between Maria and Brendan. Her acting was also quite wretched when compared to Ms. Weisz, who was able to maintain her intellectuality, demureness and gentility on top of her topnotch fighting skills. Ms. Bello fails miserably in this regard to recapture the unique character of Evie we have loved before, in my opinion.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
57,TOMNEL,I miss the mediocrity Stephen Sommers brought to the first two films.,2,2 August 2008,"Stephen Sommers is a crummy writer and does a poor job directing any action scenes, but compared to this, Sommers is a genius. In fact, compare anything in the previous Mummy films to this one, and they will look like masterpieces in comparison. This movie is bottom of the barrel bad, with only the mildest amount of entertainment saving it from being a total bore. Some laughs can be had in spite (and because) of it's stupidity, but really, this movie should not have been made! The new villain in this Mummy picture is the very nonthreatening Dragon Emperor (Jet Li), who's given a lengthy stretch of background information and character traits...something none of the main characters get. Rick and Evelyn O'Connel have slowed down now that their little boy Alex is a big man and out of the house. Evelyn is now a struggling writer, and Rick a struggling fisherman (among other things), and Evelyn cannot quite think of a third book to finish her Mummy stories. Alex has just made a find, and the gang is off to China. Luckily Jonathan (John Hannah) now owns a bar there so he can join on yet another mummy adventure, too. The gang ends up awakening the Dragon Emperor and going to the Himalayas with some friendly yetis. Chaos ensues when the Emperor tries to start up his Terracotta army.This movie was not thrilling in the least. Each scene was cut so tightly, the action scenes felt like montages, and the epic battle scenes were like schoolyard fights. The humor featured here are jokes that would be cut from a typical sit-com for being too corny. The acting is about what you'd expect, with the exception of Luke Ford as Alex, who gives a Pauly Shore worthy performance, acting like a idiot teen.Time to nit pick. I hated this movie, and don't want to go into detail all the big things that were bad about it...it was just bad. Here are the small things. The movie had the weirdest set-up. It was a 15 minute flashback, followed by 25 minutes of boredom and clichés, followed by 10 minutes of action, leading to the 45 minute long climax. Why was the climax so long and drawn out? It was awful! The scene where Rick was fishing is more climactic than the actual climax. Also, what happened to Alex's English accent. He went from a cute little English boy to a big cocky idiot with his head up his back side. What a jerk he was in this one. Why was Jonathan turned to even more of a sex starved imbecile than he was in the last film?Were yetis necessary to include? The scene with them was stupid and I felt like I was watching some bad Sci Fi channel original movie, not a Mummy movie, though in turn, this is a bad sci fi movie, so whatever, they fit fine in the stupidity of the writing. Speaking of stupidity, and jumping to the next nit pick, one line that didn't settle right with me was Rick's line ""I hate mummies!"". Okay, that line works fine in the trailer, but in context it makes no sense. He and his wife are fighting off Terracotta soldiers, with the help of mummies...so he hates the people helping him win the battle? What an ungrateful man.How did Michelle Yeoh survive to become immortal? She walked all the way to the Himilayas, only to find yetis who knew the cure to dying? Impressive.In one scene, Jonathan meets up with Rick and Evy after the mummy comes to life, and he shouldn't know what happened, yet he immediately refers to them as ""Mummy magnets"". How in the world did he know that it was a mummy? Is he psychic or something? Also, his disregard for anyones safety but his own got tiring. Too bad the yetis didn't rip his head off when they had the chance.I'm sorry my review is bouncing all over the place, but that's what this movie does to your mind. You think back to every other movie this has stolen from and your mind will be constantly wandering throughout this braindead picture. 3 mummies is too much...please don't make a fourth!!!! My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 110 mins. PG-13 for violence and sexual humor.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

Brendan Fraser is our staunch hero, Maria Bello (as a replacement for Rachel Weisz) is his loyal wife.

59,aharmas,Atrocious,1,3 August 2008,"I do like movies, so it's hard to find a film that I find utterly bad. However, those rare films do show up, and the third entry in the Brandon Frasier mummy series easily finds its niche as one of the worst movies ever made. There is very little to like in here because even trying to see the film is difficult.One of its most annoying qualities is the inept editing and framing of every single scene. This movie is not dynamic and energetic, its frenzied and out of control, it appears as if the director abandoned the set, everyone started messing around while the camera was running, then the editor was asked to come back and given orders to save what was left. Sadly, it's not like there is anything good buried in the middle of this mess.Even the winning elements from past movies suffer from the total chaos. Fraser himself is a total waste as he tries to ham it for the camera, but he seems to be aware that there is a paycheck at the end of the road, and that he needs to do nothing but plant himself in front of the camera and let the director pretend that he is doing a good job. Rachel Weisz jumped ship and gave her role to Maria Bello, who after dieing her hair a rather ugly shade of brown can't find her character, her motivation, or her way out of the chaotic mess the film is. For a truly gifted actress this is rather sad moment.Now the really bad in the movie: the special effects, which can be sophisticated and divine in this day and age are as bad as anything put together by a bunch of elementary school kids with access to sophisticated computer equipment. There is no way to enjoy or appreciate them, and without any support from the director, editor, and a rather lackluster villain, things have no way to go but straight into cinema hell.One of the least charismatic actors ever to show up in a Hollywood movie makes a horrible appearance in this film. Jet Li who has fewer facial expressions than one of the terracotta statues in the story, makes one of the most boring villains ever. He stands around, trying to look threatening and is at times as laughable as anything ever shown in a Hollywood movie. He gives anti-climatic a new meaning.Another one of the casualties is the wonderful Michelle Yeoh, a subtle and quite capable actress with more than a dash of class, but this time she is utterly lost, not knowing where to direct her attention and apparently unable to find her motivation. She should have look at the horrible mess around her and pretend she had to destroy the sets or whatever passed as screenplay.There is no magic, fantasy, thrills, or any type of joys in this film. It is a film that should be burned, buried along with type of legends attached to its story.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
60,Enchorde,Poor Jonathan...,6,17 January 2009,"Recap: The O'Connels are at it again. This time it is Rick and Evelyn's now adult son that manages to dig up and resurrect an old Chinese emperor bent on world domination. Being buried for a couple of millennia don't seem to have changed his mind much and now the O'Connel's must stop him from becoming immortal and invincible and resurrecting his army.Comments: Poor Jonathan. Where ever he goes he seems to find himself surrounded by mummies. The others are a bit more guilty keeping on resurrecting them, so they can just blame themselves.Anyway, the Mummy is back for a third installment, this time in China. A wise change I think, as a third third time with Imhotep would just be plain wrong. A good movie with some new steps and ideas but it doesn't quite live up to it's predecessors. I'm not quite sure why it doesn't. One thing might be that is more or less, even with the change in scenery, are more of the same. It is pretty entertaining with Rick (Fraser) getting himself in trouble and delivering witty remarks, but it has already been done. Twice (as Rick himself points out).One other factor might be that Bello has replaced Weisz as Evelyn. I like Bello, and I think she does it quite nice. But replacing an actress, giving a character a new face and behavior is always a risk, and it doesn't quite work. Not initially at least, as the movie progresses I thought less and less about it.The effect was that I didn't get the right feel for the movie. The previous ones has been quite intense, high-paced, witty humoristic (almost cheeky). This had all those elements but not so much of it. It was slower, thinner and didn't really hit it off.Still, it was good for an evening. If you enjoyed the previous two, i can recommend this one as well.6/10",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

As self-centered as Johnathan is, why on earth would his name his casino Imhotep's? 3. Why would an Asian lounge singer in an Egyptian themed casino in the middle of China be singing in English? 4. Why did the emperor's pose change from when we saw him turn to stone and when he was found? 5. Why didn't the writers just leave Alex in college? His character was very irritating.6. Why can't Hollywood ever get it right? First they get Maria Bello to replace Rachel Weisz(they look and act nothing alike + Maria's English accent was too upper crust...the original Evelyn did not have a snooty accent), then they get a 27 year-old to play a 20-year-old lad.7. Are we to believe that only 1 arm ripped off of general Ming's body after he was pulled in four directions by four separate horses? 8. Why on earth would anybody set a cow free in the middle of the Himalayan mountains? 9. The movie was in Mandarin/English with subtitles here and there, why then would Michelle Yeoh's sorceress cast a spell in English to awaken dead oppressed Chinese soldiers/workers? 10.

It works.I highly enjoyed seeing Brendan Fraser and John Hannah back. I liked Maria Bello though she certainly is NOT Rachel Weisz, she is pretty good considering being a subsitute isn't easy. I have fond memories of the first one esp. and if I thought this was bad or whatever I certainly would say so. It isn't.The two second leads-Luke Ford and the Chinese lass-weren't that good, blocks of wood if you like. I don't see the franchise carrying on w/ either as leads, its either Fraser or nada.I liked the Yetis-FG and all, seeing Fraser running around w/ sticks of dynamite and doing the two-gun kid routine, the sword play, the bad CGI in the Mtns, etc-it all just seems to fit in w/ what has come before.By all means check it out if you liked the first ones, but don't go expecting Indy Jones or whatever, it's def.

64,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Better Than The Second I Think,9,16 January 2012,"According to most people the third installment of Stephen Sommers ""The Mummy (1999)"" is truly the end to this trilogy. I would beg to differ; I actually think this film played out better than The Mummy Returns (2001). What seemed to be missing from the second is back and that's not all. Some extras were added and the story line is a little more improved. Yes, there are some set backs, which I well get to but really it's not a big deal. Even the ending I thought finished better than the second film. The only two actors to reprise their characters in this film are Brendan Fraser and John Hannah. Contrary to what I've read or heard, all the characters are the same as before. Nothing has changed and the jokes are still funny. Stupid slapstick, I think not. Fraser and Hannah still have their charm. As for the other characters, Maria Bello plays Evelyn whom at first I wasn't sure how she would turn out to be the next Evelyn. But in the end, I was pleased with her performance. I would have preferred to see Weisz come back but I think Bello was the next best choice for Evelyn. Alex O'Connell has also grown up which is nice to see because Alex was cool as a bratty child but now that he's grown up, he can really help out his parents (and uncle) to help take out this new mummy. Alex O'Connell is played by Luke Ford who I have not seen act in many other films. However his performance was convincing enough to be the son of the O'Connells.Michelle Yeoh and Isabella Leong also play significant characters and it's great to see them give some individuality for once instead of having the same people all the time (although I did like Oded Fehr and Arnold Vosloo). I also think people were turned off because it's a ""mummy"" movie and yet it takes place in China. OK so the villain really isn't a ""mummy"" (and wrapped and buried) but he still has the same traits as Imhotep; banished from his lifetime with a curse and awaits to when he is resurrected again to concur the world. And what's even better is that it's not the same story line. The Mummy Returns (2001) was almost like a retread because it was the same story from The Mummy (1999), except this time it included the Scorpion King. Jet Li plays one heck of villain and if he were to head up against Vosloo, Jet Li would still win, especially that he has all the earthly elements at his disposal.Another thing I didn't appreciate much from the second film was how a lot CGI was used for certain scenes. However, this one had a nice blend and I don't know if that's because this movie took some time to hit theatres after the first sequel or if it was Rob Cohen's direction but I like the feel of it more. The music is good too, which was composed by Randy Edelman, who keeps the feeling real and energetic. The last element to this film that I think really makes it worth while is the story; and I don't mean that because it took place in China! I like the story because it reunites the O'Connell family. In the beginning of the film the viewer will notice that the O'Connell family is not the family they used to be. But once the mummy business starts up again, things return to what viewers love about the O'Connells; fighting mummies together.This ""mummy"" film may have a different director, different actors, and a completely different story, but in more ways than one, this film plays better than the first sequel. It has more character development, the same funny comical vibe and still retains exciting action sequences.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
65,eric262003,Another Third-Part Downer,6,14 September 2009,"As it follows in the same format as the other two ""Mummy"" movies, ""Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" takes us back to ancient China, where a continual rivalry takes shape between the Dragon Emperor Han(Jet Li) and his adversary General Ming (Russell Wong). This all started when Ming was having a secret affair with a witch Zi Juan (Michelle Yeoh), who claims she holds the key to immortal life and summons her to give him that gift. When the Emperor hears the news about this, he kills Ming and threatens to kill the witch as well. But little does the Emperor know is that he has already been placed with a curse and is now an entombed mummy.Next, we turn our attention towards the O'Connell family, who have decided to live a peaceful tranquil life as they had promised a few years ago. It's actually quite hilarious to see this couple sitting around living a rather mundane lifestyle. They get assigned to to hand over an ancient artifact to China at the site where Emperor Han was buried. Things have changed these last few years since we've last seen the O'Connell's. For one thing, little Alex (Luke Ford) is now all grown up and is following in the family business, searching for artifacts, exploring ancient cities and civilizations and has joined his iconic parents Rick (Brendan Fraser) and Evelyn (Maria Bello in place of Rachel Weisz) to China in search of the Emperor's tomb. The meeting place for the O'Connell's is Club Imhotep in China which follows up to the other two ""Mummy"" movies. How ironic that Evelyn's upper-class brother Jonathan (John Hannah) happens to be the owner of the resort. It seems that Alex and Uncle Jonathan have been staying in touch for a while. Jonathan is obviously the most enthused member of the family in this thrill-seeking quest with uninspired drivel towards his hatred against mummies.Of course that provokes the mummy as he embarks on a violent frenzy towards a group of military people who have awakened him in his eternal rest. The action scenes were very entertaining and never loses its appeal, but the realism seems absent. The special effects were there, but were not put in much use. The movie is just self-righteous in patriotism and by adding Uncle Jonathan to the fray, proves that this movie is pushing towards American patriotism. One might enter the theatre expecting some exciting, high-flying, quick-paced martial arts action because it features such stars like Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh, in the end it was a letdown, because the action was really dull and lacked very little tension at all. The smirk on Li's face when Fraser demands him to ""fight like a man"" indicates the Li was bored out of his mind to be in this movie. Li was sadly miscast in this film, not because his action scenes were watered down, but knowing that he has starred in more better films than this one. Yeoh seems emotionless in most of her scenes and when a sign of emotion was needed when she raises the undead below the Great Wall of China. Not that they are the blame for their poor performances, but because mostly to the trite script. Overall this movie is another reason why the third part of a sequel never measures up with the two scripts before it. It doesn't have that grimness or suspense like the other two ""Mummy"" films.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
66,moviewizguy,A New Evil Awakens.,7,2 August 2008,"In the Far East, trouble-seeking father-and-son duo Rick and Alex O'Connell unearth the mummy of the first Emperor of Qin -- a shape-shifting entity who was cursed by a wizard centuries ago.Imagine the first two Mummy films and add a whole new Asian twist to it. The result is what you'll get in ""Tomb of the Dragon Emperor."" Believe it or not, doing just that adds a whole new originality to the franchise. The good thing about this is that you don't get anymore sand, pyramids, and the whole Imhoptep thing again, which I like.There's no question about it: ""Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" should only be seen by people who wants to have a fun time at the movies. It's no Dark Knight, a movie that makes you think a lot. No, instead, it's a ""shut off the brain"" type of movie with fantastic action sequences and humorous scenes, although with a very cheesy story and probably not brilliant screen writing.I believe this is the best in the series, including the most entertaining one, but that's just me. Ironically, this film is the most family-friendly movie in the entire trilogy, although the events that happen in here is much more violent and shocking. Yes, what I'm saying is that the violence in here is not pulled back. You get decapitations, mutilations, melting skin, and all that.Brendan Fraser does a great job with the action adventure scenario, as always. Maria Bello now replaces Rachel Weisz's role from the previous two films and well, I obviously think Weisz plays it better but Bello does a decent job. John Hannah is not as funny as he was in the previous two but funny enough and Luke Ford was decent as the son who is probably seen 10 years younger than Fraser. Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh both do surprisingly well with their roles as well.Why did the critics pan this? Obviously, they just don't know when to have a fun time at the movies, or at least that's the impression I'm getting from them. If you think this movie is a waste of time, don't bother watching it. If you do, it's a fun family film. Although the movie is dumb, preposterous, and sometimes laughable, that doesn't stop it from being entertaining and funny. When the ball gets rolling, it's just non-stop fun from there.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
67,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"Third ""Mummy"" film is pure, non-stop fun! Logic and Intelligence need not apply...",8,22 August 2008,"Director Rob Cohen and writers Alfred Gough and Miles Millar take over for Stephen Sommers to create the third film in the ""Mummy"" series, ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor."" And they deliver the thrills, excitement and non-stop laughs that made the first two so much fun to watch! Now, I know what you're saying- ""This movie looks so silly!"" Well, that's exactly the point! This isn't the next contender for Best Picture- it is simply a dash of pure adventure. Intelligence need not apply.As with the first two, the film starts us off with the back story of the villain, this time China's Dragon Emperor (Jet Li is, as always, makes a great villain), who was a dreaded conquerer that sought the assistance of the sorceress Zi Juan (Michele Yeoh) to help him find the secret to eternal life. But when the Emperor discovered that Zi Juan (who he wanted to become his queen) had grown to love his top General, he turned on them both, killing the General while his love Zi Juan watched. Then, as he descended upon her, she revealed that she had managed to curse him, transforming the Emperor and his army into terracotta statues, where they shall remain for all eternity... Or at least until a giddy adventurer revives them! (The terracotta soldiers are a nice touch, as they are based on actual terracotta soldiers, which were burial art created for China's Emporer Qin Shi Huang.) Flash to the 1940's. Alex O'Connell (Luke Ford in a fairly good performance), the now 20-or-so-years-old son of adventurers Rick and Evie O'Connell, has just discovered the tomb of the Dragon Emperor, and is charged with bringing his remains to a museum in Shanghai.At the same time, Rick (Brendan Fraser, fitting perfectly back in) is trying to adjust to his new life of retirement. He is introduced in a hilarious scene where he attempts fly-fishing, at one point quipping something along the lines of: ""THIS is what people do when they retire?"" Evie (Maria Bello, doing a good-enough job taking over for Rachael Weiz... mostly) is doing better. She has spent her time adapting her and Rick's two previous adventures into ""ficticious"" novels, which have become all the rage. The novels, of course being ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns."" Unfortunately, she made a deal with the publisher to write a third book, and she just can't seem to get any inspiration. And it becomes painfully clear that both Evie and Rick miss the good old days of adventuring and excitement, though for the sake of each other, they deny it.At least Jonathan (John Hannah, perfect as usual), Evie's brother, is doing alright, having opened an Egyptian-themed club in Shanghai called, oddly enough, ""Imhotep's"". I guess he can't let go of the past either.Soon, Rick and Evie are persuaded to take an ancient and priceless artifact to the same Shanghai museum where Alex is delivering the Dragon Emperor's remains... And after a shaky but humorous family reunion at Jonathan's club, it becomes very clear that this was no coincidence, as the artifact that Rick and Evie transported holds the key to resurrecting the Dragon Emperor. It is here that the character of Lin is reintroduced. She fought and nearly killed Alex back in the crypt of the Emporer, but we now learn that she is simply trying to stop his resurrection, and so she forms an uneasy alliance with Alex. (Which of course ends up blossoming into a romance...) Basically, two evil generals (Yang and Choi) lead a military cult which worship's the Dragon Emperor and desires to bring him back. And soon, during a tense action set-piece, the deed is done, when the artifact the O'Connells have (actually water from a spring of eternal life) is smashed on the Dragon Emperor's body, brining him back in his ferocious Terracotta form.From there on in, it is a race against time to stop the emperor from regaining all his powers (which include control over the elements, and the ability to transform himself into the dreaded creatures of old- such as dragons and boar-like demons) and raising his Terracotta Army from their tomb.The film is a roller-coaster ride, featuring everything from puppy-dog-like Yeti's that know how to kick bad-guy tail, to a giant battle between two undead armies, the Terracotta soldiers and an ancient army that the Emperor murdered and had buried under the Great Wall during its construction so long ago. (""These are the good undead guys... right?"") What struck me about this film, in comparison to the last sequel, is the amount of time given to the characters and their development. Take the scene where Rick is looking at his old Legionaire get-up from the first film with an amazing longing in his eyes- it is a beautiful little moment. Or the awkward moments where Evie pretends that she is no longer interested in exploring and adventuring... you can tell she truly wants her old life back.I attribute this to writers Gough and Millar, who gave a lot of heart to the characters, as they have with their previous works. And Rob Cohen, though his track record is a bit inconsistent, does know how to deliver visual goods on amazing levels. Definitely an interesting team to take over for Sommers, who remained as a producer.And while I have a few problems with the film, mainly that I felt it should have been just a little longer and perhaps further explained the legends and history it is based around, I cannot complain that much about it.So, here's to ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"", this Summer's underrated gem of pure, dumb-fun adventure!

70,Sirus_the_Virus,"Sue me, I liked it.",7,10 January 2010,"Alright, alright quit booing. I enjoyed The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon emperor. I am going to review film series that I never got around to reviewing. The Mummy series is first on my list. Though I am going to review them in reverse order for some reason I don't know why. The Mummy 3 isn't the best in the series. I am going to say second though. Cause it was more original than the second one. Though stupider. The Mummy 3 is just plain dumb fun. Roger Ebert saw what I saw but what clearly nobody else saw. This is obviously a flawed film. For instance, there is yetti's shown here. Also, there is dragons and other stuff. Also, Brendan Fraser, the leader of these Mummy films, is only like 5 years older than the guy who plays his son. Maria Bello is probably a similar situation. Another thing is that Maria Bello is definitely not British. Her accent here isn't awful but it's not great.Now i'll admit that I liked the first two. I liked the entire trilogy. I am not going to say that these movies are underrated cause I will agree with people that this is a stupid film. But they never have any boring moments.What's the third one about? Well, here, The Oconnell Clan(played by Brendan Fraser, Maria Bello, and Luke Ford) have moved on with their lives. Rick and Evy are now retired. And Alex is God knows where. Evy is writing novels on their old adventure. One afternoon they are asked to look after The Eye of Shangrila or something like that. So they travel down to Hong Kong where they run into Johnathon(my favorite character played by John Hannah), Evy's brother. Also, they run into their son. When they go to the museum, they accidentally unleash a new Mummy, The Dragon emperor(played by Jet Li), a Chinese king who was cursed years ago when he killed Zen's(played by the always likable Michelle Yeoh)lover. So obviously they have to try and put him away.Whjat's weird about the mummy here is that he isn't exactly a mummy. He is a statue and then starts doing stuff. He is a shape shifter. Alright, the film is a little silly. But they are fun. They are far from perfection, but they are enjoyable.The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon emperor: B",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
71,Angelus2,It's a good family film...But the comedy is a little too much,8,23 October 2009,"I watched the 'Mummy' movies as a kid and so this film kind of brought back memories; however now a little older and wiser I think that the comedy here is over-bearing on the actual script.The plot is basically kind of the same, only set in China.Rick and Evie's twenty year old son, Alex uncovers the kingdom of the Dragon Emperror but it turns out that there is an evil organisation looking to awaken the mummy...(Didn't see that one coming) The cast provide satisfactory performances, Brendan Frasier who hasn't had much luck in getting good solid work in anything else, returns as the tough and witty Rick O'Connel, which Maria Bello replaces Rachel Weiz and her fake English accent becomes quite annoying...Luke Ford kind of reminds you of Rick during the first film, while John Hannah simply fails with the laughs here....Jet Li and Michele Yeoh are simply dazzling, Jet Li looks really menacing while Michelle is beautiful as always...My favourite scene was the arrival of the Yeti's which look amazing...Yes, the films opening is weak but the action makes up for the bad script and after all it's a family adventure movie...",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
72,Sergiodave,Curse of the 3rd movie,4,21 September 2020,"The only reason I gave this 4 star was because if for some ridiculous reason you hadn't seen the first two movies in this trilogy, you might think it was passable. For those who have, this was bad. The worst part was Maria Bello playing Rachel Weisz's part. They should have written her character out, died in childbirth or something like that. At least we won't have to stomach a Mummy IV, thank heaven for small mercies.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
73,TheUnknown837-1,one of the biggest disappointments in my movie-going experiences,2,18 October 2008,"Upon seeing the trailers for the third installment in the Brendon Fraser mummy series and reading articles and reports on its production, I was starting to get some doubts onto how good this movie was going to be. The fact that Arnold Vosloo's Imhotept, director Stephen Sommers, actress Rachel Weisz, and many other elements from the first two movies were going to be absent in this installment had already given me a feeling in my gut that this film was going to be pretty lackluster. Still, I was excited to see it since I loved the first two movies, I just didn't realize that by predicting it to be lackluster, I was giving an understatement.Brendon Fraser is back as adventurer Rick O'Connell; he is now retired with his librarian wife Evelyn (now played by Mario Bello) who are given the assignment for some odd reason to deliver a precious jewel to the Chinese government around the same time that their son Alex (now played by Luke Ford, who is strangely no more than ten or fifteen years younger than his screen parents) has unintentionally awakened a new mummy played by Jet Li. They pick up Evelyn's brother Jonathan (still played by John Hannah) and once again, have to tackle the forces of the undead. They face the mummy, its allies, strange creatures, and so on and so forth.Even though this movie had some plot elements that, if wielded right, might have turned out to be acceptable, if not fun action movie and an okay third installment, it just does not work. It was not wielded right by the screenwriters and new director Rob Cohen and as much as I hate to admit it, this movie was just pure boredom from start to finish. I loved the first ""The Mummy"" (1999). I thought it was the quintessential action-comedy movie of all time and I still believe that to this day. While ""The Mummy Returns"" (2001) was not as good, it was still a lot of fun and I enjoyed it tremendously. But ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" is not a worthy sequel. The script is poorly-written, the plot is murky, the comedy is dull, the action is numerous but poorly-executed, and it's not until within the last ten minutes that I actually felt what I went to the theater for: entertainment. Performances by the cast were good. I was surprised as how well Mario Bello took over Rachel Weisz's role in the film. But as good as the acting was, they were just playing characters that did not work. Frazer's Rick O'Connell in this movie is just a watered down version of his previous two performances. There's only one moment in the film where he says ""Time to go!"" that was so memorable in the first two movies. Here, it's so low-key and dull that it doesn't work. It needed a few more takes, as did the whole film. Here, because he has poor material to work with, Frazer plays a boring character. I also did not like how Alex O'Connell was transformed from this bright, smart-mouth kid into this calm, in-control Indiana Jones-want-to-be. Now he's just bland and sometimes irritating. The new mummy, though well-played by Jet Li, is not interesting. Imhotept, played by Arnold Vosloo in the first two films, was an interesting mummy. This new mummy is boring and there's no mystery or questioning as to what he's going to do. In fact, they reveal the way they are going to kill him two minutes after he is awakened from the dead. In the previous two films, there was conflict as the characters worked on a way to conquer their undead enemies. And goofy, lazy brother-in-law Jonathan just isn't funny anymore. He's a background character. Everybody in this movie is a background character. The special effects and the action scenes aren't very well-done either. The CGI done for this movie was pretty lackluster. There were some effects that were well-done, but other effects including this scene where a man melts into mud and those abominable snowmen look like they came out of a cheap video game. Putting aside the lackluster effects, even they would have worked if the action was good. But it wasn't. It was all predictable and happened too fast or too long and thus, it wore itself down and wore me down. And the fact that the music was unfitting did not aid either.I was yawning a lot during this movie.Bottom line, this is a very poor third installment and I shall not give it a second chance. It is a disgrace when compared to its two prequels and is just a disgrace of film-making itself. And the thing is; at the end of this movie, there's this supposed-to-be funny epilogue message stating that mummies were later found coming to life in South America. I hope that does not mean there's going to be a fourth mummy film. I've have enough. The first two were exceedingly good action-comedy films. This is cinematic trash.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
74,PatrynXX,Erm. Well this makes Battlefield Earth look good. :(,4,31 May 2021,"Yes Rachel Weisz was right. Brenden shouldn't have been in this one. Gonna age a son what 20 years well this those parents aren't gonna be looking like they can jump thru walls. True if Asian women are involved I'm taking their site. Even the bad lady who well does a Hellboy thing. Wonder what movies they didn't rip off for this. For sure some Indian Jones 2 and 3 (with Rope and healing and the graphics were better done in 1989...) Hellboy (Hell hath no.. whatever for us as the general and the scarred one get really pressed together... One too many love stories stuffed in this movie. I think the only one that bothers to hold the movie together is Lin and. Zi. (and this came 11 yrs after Tomorrow Never Dies.... ) Considering what the director said of Rachel there'd be a reason I didn't watch it till now. Oh she's a really bad actress ... um no when it takes a 20 yr old Ling as a subplot character to be the better actor in the movie. Eh Some actors need good directors. Some actors don't. Brenden usually needs a good director. So Mummy 1 and 2 were just fine. This one primarily the Chinese characters showed any emotion. The 20 yr old actress is like 25 % chinese Michelle a bit more .. I would not have guessed it though.. Wish she was in more movies but this one was not the best choice even though she held the movie up. Zero chem between Brenden and the replacement. Brenden and Rachel well yeah. But this one turned her into a Dominatrix sex bomb. O_O Someone shoulda yelled You are Fired director. Especially with no mummies in a Mummy movie. Most Chinese mummies were from Caucasians . But I ended up with this one cause it was more or less free with the 4K set.. $47 invidiually or $31 for the set. Dad got it on bd as one of our first ones but I've never watched it. Mainly because what a Sexist the director is about about really good Actresses and this is not a Soap Opera!!!Quality: 4/10 (mainly because of Isabella Leong.Entertainment: Action scenes 6/10 Everything else 2/10 (with the exception of the Mother/Daughter plot. )

75,vip_ebriega,"""Does the term Rest in Peace mean anything to you?""",4,21 August 2009,"My Take: An effects-heavy sequel that's only in it for the money. The MUMMY franchise has pretty much run out of gas, but if you know Hollywood, they can't send this franchise to its tomb just yet Allow me to admit that I love the first two MUMMY movies. They're not exactly brilliant film-making but director Stephen Sommers clearly has an admiration for the good old action adventure, yet he also understands what makes the audience want in a movie. Marring these two, he has managed to make a cool blockbuster while living up to the quality of a rip-snorting pulpy adventure movie. So I guess a third MUMMY movie done by the right guys, tired as it will be, might just be worthwhile for this fan of the franchise. But THE MUMMY: TOMB OF THE DRAGON EMPEROR already showed the makings of a true disaster. Stephen Sommers backed out from the director's chair and is replaced by Rob Cohen (THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS), not exactly one of my favorite directors. Rachel Weisz refused to return for the role of Evie, so (for unknown reasons) they decided that Maria Bello will be a perfect replacement. Good actress, but an odd choice for the role. And don't get me started on Luke Ford as an adult Alex (wasn't he somehow British in the last film?)! Oh yeah, did I mention this one is set in China now? There are enough problems with this third MUMMY movie to give me a reason not to see it, so I intentionally missed it on the big screen. Seeing it on TV with very low expectations might probably help. Despite a new locale, it's business as usual for the O'Connells: Rick (Fraser) and Evie (Bello) are retired but still yearns for the days of adventure, Alex (Ford) refuses to study in college in order to uncover the legendary Dragon Emperor and his Terra Cotta Army, petrified years ago by an ancient witch. As if not learning anything, they reawaken the age-old evil who again wants to take over the world. So it's up to them again to slay the Emperor and save the world. All in a days work! It feels like a cheaper spin-off of the original movies, and sure, the casting mishaps and excessive CGI are overbearing. Only John Hannah's return for comic relief as the long-suffering Jonathan managed to charm. Fraser is still game as our hero, but is given very little to do, while Bello and Ford are just ridiculous in obviously faux accents. Ironically, the best stars of the show are the ones getting the least screen time. Jet Li seems to enjoy hamming it up as the Emperor (who appears in both the opening and closing scenes) and Michelle Yeoh gives a rather dignified appearance as the wise old sorceress. Unfortunately, THE MUMMY: TOMB OF THE DRAGON EMPEROR is just a tired affair that's not as fun as the first two movies. Cohen lacks the certain snap the Stephen Sommers gave in the first two movies, partly because of his interest in making a movie about China, but not so much in the franchise which therein lies the problem. It's watchable stuff, but it's all second-rate stuff, really. Rating: ** out of 5.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
76,adamscastlevania2,Popcorn fluff cash-in,5,4 October 2014,"(46%) A second sequel made for the benefit of the money men, rather than the audience, as this ticks boxes like a grocery list. There's the same shooting based action of the other two, the near indestructible mummy bad guy, and a chase through a built up city that feels cut and pasted. Brendan Fraser is largely the same as he was in the other movies, which is both a good and bad thing; although losing Rachel Weisz is the stuff of TV sitcoms. Jet Li is hardly in the movie as himself, rather than a CG monster, and he's maybe one of the blandest bad guys ever. On a plus side though there is a lot of action, even if it is too shakily shot, and there is some fun to be had; but is is a very forgettable, overly hectic watch.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
77,ivo-cobra8,I like it! Defending an underrated hateful third Mummy ride!,6,5 December 2015,"Disclaimer: If you are a viewer that mainly prefers art-house-type movies, then you might as well ignore this review. In addition, if you're not able to take the third solid entry of the trilogy franchise, ignore this review, as well. We'll both be better off. The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008) is very underrated solid good third entry of the Mummy at least much better than The Scorpion King which that movie was really awful and terrible this one isn't! I prefer The Tomb of the Dragon Emperor over The Scorpion King. I have enjoyed this third movie I thought was a good movie. I am wondering I am the only one who did like this movie and wasn't annoyed with the cast Maria Bello and Luke Ford as the new replacements? It did not annoyed me, this Mummy was still fun to watch despite it went on a different direction. This film wasn't terrible, but if you think is terrible why are always the trilogy so underrated tell me why? Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines a solid flick better than reboot. Jurassic Park III better than the fourth movie, Blade: Trinity, Rambo III, The Godfather Part III and Beverly Hills Cop III. I like them all even tough they aren't so good and they are flawed movies. Next Year we are getting a reboot of The Mummy with Tom Cruise in it. I don't think the movie will be great been PG-13 rating and ruining a classic film The Mummy including the remake of my favorite franchise. I am choosing this movie over remake simply is that. Another thing I want to say: Maria Bello did a good job been cast as Evelyn Carnahan after Rachel Weisz declined to reprise her role back for the third time. Brendan Fraser and John Hannah did return in this flick. The new director Rob Cohen from (The Fast and the Furious) did a good job, despite Stephen Sommers did not direct the film and almost had nothing to do with the film, except been a producer. Critics on this film were harsh on it despite the film went on a different direction. In this movie are also Jet Li, Michelle Yeoh and Russell Wong./: Jet Li and Russell Wong started together in the movie Rome Must Die (2000) eight years earlier. In my opinion the new cast the director and the writers did good job despite the movie was a flop, it is still good on, it's own way. People get to into the hype and get themselves all excited like a kid at Christmas and then of course no movie can ever live up to those expectations. This is a good action flick in the Mummy world. If you liked the mummy returns, then rest assured you'll like this movie. When a 2,000-year-old curse is broken, a ruthless dragon emperor (Li) comes back to life with a diabolical plan to enslave the world. Mankind's only hope against him and his legions of undead warriors lies with the courageous O'Connell family, who chase him from the dangerous catacombs of China, to the icy Himalayas and beyond. Featuring intense battle sequences, breathtaking visual effects and extraordinary creatures, it's a thrilling journey that Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times calls ""the best in the series!"" The only one problem with the film I have the mummies are in China, there are no Mummies in China!! The story was really lame even tough they made a different version of the trilogy, that is the main problem. I am a hardcore fan of the Mummy trilogy and I do agree this movie has more flaws than The Mummy Returns has and It is lame, but is not that bad people. If you liked the first two movies why not liking this one? Geesh! You love Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade but you hate The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor that is lame for me! I am giving a 6/10 I don't care what you haters say or are you with me or not, I thought on it's own way was a good film and Brendan Fraser did a good job in this movie. Stop bashing it!

78,fernandoschiavi,"The Mummy 3 fails to capture the essence of its predecessors, bringing us unnecessary entertainment, which tires us already in the first half of the film",5,5 July 2020,"The franchise ""The Mummy"" started in a spectacular way, bringing an adventure tone as not seen in cinema for several years. With worldwide success, a sequence was soon ordered that, although inferior and not original, also achieved an excellent collection at the box office. Seven years later, Universal Pictures decides to take a third part to theaters, which would close the arcs of the main characters. The film was directed by Rob Cohen, written by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, who devised a script based on the real life of Qin Shi Huang of the Chin Dynasty, who was buried amidst thousands of worked terracotta soldiers, the so-called Army of Terracotta, at the latest until 210 BC (Incidentally, the Terracotta Army is actually mentioned in the end as something that will be discovered in the future, despite its relationship with the emperor's army, or rather, how the destroyed army managed to enter the place is left unexplained). Stephen Sommers (director of the two previous films) returns only as a producer. Brendan Fraser, John Hannah, Luke Ford, Jet Li and Maria Bello, who replaces Rachel Weisz, who did not return for ""problems with the script"", in addition to having just given birth to her son.Perhaps the biggest problem in this third part of the franchise is the heart. Even if compared to the first A Mummy, of 1999, and the continuation of 2001, the third loses. While the first iteration normally emerges as an original perspective and charged with contradictory elements that peer into it with complexity, fun and satisfaction, the following ones end up losing a little of their luster and fall into the ruins of oblivion, labeled as ""generic films"" and with a great loss of potential. Unfortunately, this is the case here. History exchanges the sands of Egypt for those of China. What really hurts Mummy 3 is the script, written by the creators of Smallville, Alfred Gough and Miles Millar. Such a film is already expected to be full of continuity holes, but Gough and Millar do more. Annoying catchphrases and out-of-the-minute jokes are expected, but the writers excel. Enter the action scene (explosion, funny phrase, exchange of shots, funny phrase), cut to a dramatic element (emperor gains powers back, assistant explains aloud ""the emperor is gaining his powers back!""), Closes action (the avalanche begins on the mountain, the assistant explains aloud ""avalanche!""), cuts to the transition of set pieces (all inexplicably on board an airplane), begins the next action scene, and so on.Things here are represented through utilitarian and unnecessarily pseudo-metaphorical Manichaeism, for while Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) brought with it a historical arc and an archetypal outline that transcended the concepts of good and evil - even if it was driven by a corruptible desire -, Han is simply the result of creative weariness on the part of screenwriters Alfred Gough and Miles Millar and does not emerge as a character neither pleasant nor hateful - but simply ... Existing. Imhotep's revenge was bathed in a past of romance and betrayal that took him down an obscure path and culminated in his condemnation to a fate worse than death - suspension in purgatory. The Emperor is essentially evil, but this aspect of his personality is not explored very hard and does not allow the connection between the created world and the viewer.
The script, in addition to being little inspired, does not develop well the few conflicts it creates. An example of the lack of creativity in the text are the obvious strokes that permeate the production, whether in the alternation of disposition of the main couple in their aristocratic home, or in the battle scenes in which Rick's jokes are restricted to a single gag with a shirt. Let us also not forget the apparitions of the abominable snowmen (where they really came from) and the plane that teleports, aside from the ridiculous and pathetic ""hook"" at the end of the work. Gough and Millar give us the impression that they had no idea what to put in the text and end up introducing new elements countless times, creating holes and situations too convenient, such as the villain's ability to change form, the need for his army to cross the wall to become immortal or the dagger as the only weapon capable of killing him once and for all. None of these points are minimally worked on throughout the film, they are simply played in the narrative and we need to accept them, in the same way that the characters get rid of any possible and imaginable questions.Brendan Fraser returns as Rick in yet another of his comic incarnations. However, what seems is that the haughtiness of yore that accompanied his character through adventures and allowed him to dose the comedy and drama in a balanced way gave way to scenic lethargy. The chemistry between him and Weisz was enviable and showed in a mutual way how the potential of two actors could go beyond the physical limits of a feature film and spill over into the public's fixed eyes; but with Bello, that passion is nonexistent. The promotional material says that Li would not have much time available for filming, but he didn't care that his character was recreated on the computer. In his quick appearances he is quickly transformed into creatures of sand and even a flying dragon. To complete the cast, the always great Michelle Yeoh grants some respectability to the sorceress Zi Juan. The beautiful Isabella Leong is very willing in her first work in English, convincing like the mysterious Lin, although she still appears somewhat insecure on the screen. Veteran Anthony Wong has the ideal air of authority for General Yang, being quite comfortable on paper.The result is too cold for an adventure film. The script makes an effort to give humor and lightness to a heavy dinosaur. The appearance of a son of the character of Brendan Fraser is a somewhat poorly developed solution. Jonathan, Rick, Evy and Alex are not in the same narrative tune and seem to be tied to each of their microcosms, each fighting for the rectification of values - rectification that is not explored even superficially by history.The production designer is one of the best things in the film. The construction of the scenarios is interesting and manages to bring the best of two worlds to the same sequence. Timelessness is a clearly visible element when we have, in the same frame, the presence of post-war modernity arriving in China - revolvers, clothing, automobiles and even New Year's decorations - entering into a pleasant shock with the medievalist of the imperial government, with sumptuous architecture and a constant belief in the supernatural. Visual effects, on the other hand, are the reason for an incredible $ 175 million budget and justify that. Particularly effective are those used to conceive the villain experienced by Jet Li and his stone horses - and even if the inclusion of a tribe of Abominable Snowmen sounds like another desperate measure of the script (don't ask), it's a consolation to note that these are technically flawless. On the other hand, not even the best effects in the world can bring emotional resonance to a poorly developed narrative - and to see two gigantic armies made up of computer-generated anonymous facing each other on a vast and equally virtual plain is an experience that fills the eyes, but that does not make no dramatic impact. As if that were not enough, Cohen films and assembles the fight sequences in a chaotic way, wasting even what should be an iconic moment: the fight between Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh.
Rob Cohen, despite his talent for more pyrotechnic scenes, here does a poor job of directing. Conceiving some simply ridiculous plans (in a certain dialogue between Rick and Evelyn, the camera is ridiculously positioned), Cohen ignores basic principles of how to tell a story, trampling facts and inserting impossible ellipses, besides showing his little familiarity with the franchise ever knowing how to lead your actors in the correct tone of this. Mummy 3 abandons any vestige of the self-parody that made its predecessors bearable, as Fraser and Hannah seem to be the only ones to insist on a semi-comic approach - in an effort sabotaged by the script, co-stars and Rob Cohen's chaotic direction, who, without understand very well what sustains a comedy, uses Randy Edelman's weak score to pack, with a funny song, scenes whose comedic efforts have already failed (suffice it to say that in two moments separated from each other for a few minutes, Cohen and Edelman they even appeal to the old - and worn - out joke of the romantic track that is suddenly interrupted when a character's efforts to seduce are thwarted by the partner). It is worth saying that the writers' despair in the conception of the jokes becomes so intense that, at a certain moment, they even throw a cow in the film without the slightest explanation, placing it on a plane for the simple purpose of including an eschatological gag; as soon as it fulfills this function, it is discarded without us finding out why it was there.The third and final film in the A Mummy franchise marks its own decline, noticeable since its predecessor. Through a very weak and unidentified script, ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"", therefore, fails to capture the essence of its predecessors, bringing us unnecessary entertainment, which tires us already in the first half of the film. Having in their hands the opportunity to constantly renew the franchise, the directors throw everything up in an attempt to offer something great and, in this endeavor, forget that the most important element of this series is the atmosphere of adventure and not the epic tone of great battles or super powered villains. When not even the humor of this reboot of The Mummy manages to arrest us, it becomes very clear that the series must come to an end.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
79,Danusha_Goska,Goofy Fun,8,3 August 2008,"""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" was a lot of goofy fun. The special effects were new to me: I've never seen an army of terra cotta soldiers fight an army of skeletons. There was a coherent plot that was worked through from the first scene to the last (a couple of comic book / boy's adventure movies I saw this summer had no plot whatsoever.) There was a convincing and poignant love story between the beautiful Michelle Yeoh and the handsome Russell Wong. The rest of the cast is all great, with Jet Li as a marshal arts expert and evil emperor, Anthony Wong, who was so good in ""The Painted Veil"" as his worshipful follower, General Yang, and most of the rest of the very excellent gang from the previous mummy films. The costumes were stylish and often beautiful. Michelle Yeoh wears a lovely turquoise gown that I'd watch the movie again just to see.Unlike other summer, 2008 boy's adventure movies that don't even deserve to be mentioned here, ""Dragon Emperor"" does not take itself seriously. Even so, it is smarter and more interesting than 2008's self-important, inexplicably well reviewed comic book movies. Like ""300,"" ""Dragon Emperor"" addresses the West's anxieties about the stereotypical image of ""oriental despotism"" v. Western freedom and individuality, and it addresses the West's current anxieties about the rise of China. General Yang knows he is resurrecting a despot, and he thinks that that is exactly what a chaotic China needs  a bossman at the top who will order his faceless, nameless masses to their deaths at his command. Not all the Chinese characters are evil. Michelle Yeoh and Russell Wong are excellent and admirable Chinese freedom fighters.The movie isn't perfect, but it is a lot of fun, and it does not deserve the bad reviews it's been getting.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
80,swilliky,A failure to add another installment to a dead franchise,3,11 June 2017,"The third and final installment in this Mummy series takes the adventure to a different part of the world while dipping in quality and recasting major characters. The story begins as all the others with a prologue of forbidden romance narrated by the witch Zi Yuan (Michelle Yeoh) about the evil Dragon Emperor (Jet Li). Centuries later, Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) has settled into a simpler life. The recasting of Evelyn (Maria Bello) is a strange thing and feels very off for this installment. Maria Bello is a fine actress but this role was established in previous films and just felt off for this film. Alex (Luke Ford0 has grown up and is on a dig in China. He invades the Tomb of the Dragon Emperor setting off every trap possible and getting nearly all of his coworkers killed, except the old man Roger Wilson (David Calder). He is attacked by a ninja, Lin (Isabella Leong) but escapes. The O'Connells head to Shanghai transporting an artifact back and to see Evelyn's brother Jonathan (John Hannah) who runs a bar.

81,manitobaman81,Good,7,5 September 2014,"I find it impossible that anyone associated with this film expected the audience to buy this. This is one of the worst movies ever, and that's why you must see it. It is more unintentionally funny than most actual comedies, and it provides as much entertainment value by accident as many movies do on purpose. Here is what I think happened: the producers decided that they wanted to cash in on the franchise one more time. The scriptwriters cooked up another story. So what do we get? We get sludge. You can tell that everybody in this movie knew that it was a stinker, so why try? Maybe the worst thing about this movie is that deep down, beneath the bad acting and the awful script, there were some okay ideas. This one shows up on satellite somewhere every once in a while, and if you can catch it, I recommend it.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
82,jdkraus,"Ignore the bashing, this is something worth seeing!",9,1 August 2008,"Like many people on IMDb, I thought this movie was going to blow. The main reason was because this Mummy did not have Stephen Sommers as the director/writer, and Rachel Weisz as Evelyn (who turned the role down because she did not like the script). Without those two key players and also Rob Cohen as the director (probably one of my least favorite directors), I thought the movie would lose it's originality of the first two films and fail. Despite these two absences, I learned after seeing this film that it should not be judged solely on those problems. ""The Mummy: Tomb of The Dragon Emperor"" is actually a pretty darn good movie.It is 1946 and Alex O'Connell (Luke Ford) goes on an archaeological dig to find an emperor (Jet Li) in China who has been lost for thousands of years. Meanwhile, his parents (Brendan Fraser and Maria Bello) are retired from their adventures, trying to relax for the rest of their lives. Once again, they are called to action to go to China for a mission and later discover that Alex (whom they thought was in college) had found a mummy and there are some bad guys who want to resurrect him. It all goes from here.Even though the story is unrealistic (like the first two films) I found myself enjoying it. I liked the Chinese mythology they throw in the mix as well as some of the fantasy elements, such as the emperor's ability to control fire, water, metal, etc.The visual effects are amazing. The first two Mummies are diminutive compared to this one's. One of the most awe-inspiring scenes is the battle clash between the two undead armies. I have not seen something that cool since last summer's blockbuster ""Transformers"".As with the actors, I liked them all. Brendan Fraser is his typical self as the heroic yet funny Rick O'Connell. Jet Li was not a bad choice as a villain. He was no Imhotep, but he was still evil and menacing. Maria Bello as Evelyn was not a bad pick. I've only seen her in a couple of other movies, but she was believable. I still prefer Rachel Weisz though. Michelle Yeoh and Luke Ford were also good sidekicks as Zi Juan and Alex O'Connell. But the real screen charmer was John Hannah as Evelyn's hysterical brother, Jonathan.Overall, this is a surprisingly great movie. I will admit though that I find it funny Evie's and Rick's son has aged to a young adult yet Brendan Fraser has not changed a bit in age. This is not the best thing in the world, but it is better than many other movies I have seen this year. Ignore the bashing, this is something worth seeing! 9/10",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
83,Carycomic,OK! Let the inevitable comparisons begin.,10,2 August 2008,"Was this better than IJ/KOTCS? Slightly! But, only because it was set just after WWII, rather than the mid-1950's. Hence, there was a little more swashbuckling light-heartedness than in Harrison Ford's flick (which seems to be the primary objection among the latter's detractors).Does this copy-cat Ford's flick with the father/son bonding subplot? Superficially! ""Mutt"" Williams, as played by Shia LeBeouf, seems to be a teen prodigy searching for one specific thing (=field of endeavor) in which to channel all his talents and energy.Yet, Alex O'Connell, as played by Luke Ford, has already decided what he wants to do. He wants to follow in his parents' globe-trotting footsteps! Rick O'Connell is approaching middle age, however, and he wants to be a more responsible adult than he was twenty years earlier. He particularly wants Alex to avoid making the same youthful indiscretions. What he fails to realize, though, is that trying to _force_ his son to be an honest man might actually make him do the opposite, out of spite.Should Ford's flick have stuck to the same quasi-mystical theme, rather than delving into science fiction? Definitely not! The 1950's was considered a time of looking to the future. And, space exploration was considered part of that future. But, the mid/late 1940's was a time for concentrating on the present. Rebuilding what World War II had destroyed. And, reconnecting with the loved ones not killed during it. Or, in Alex's case, finding that oh-so important first love (which is usually regarded as ""mystical"" in its own right).Did MUMMY: TOTDE have better special effects than IJ/KOTCS? Not really! It simply had more of them. My three particular favorites? The CGI Yetis; the matte painting of Shangri-La; and the climatic Battle of the Zombies!Last, but not least: Should everyone who disliked Ford's flick go see this sequel? Oh, yeah! Most definitely so.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
84,anselmdaniel,A rapid departure,5,12 October 2019,"This review contains spoilers.The Mummy: Tome of the Dragon Emperor is an action adventure movie that premiered in 2008. The movie is directed by Rob Cohen and is written by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar. The movie stars Brendan Fraser, Jet Li, and Maria Bello. The movie is the sequel to The Mummy Returns and departs from its Egyptian setting.The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is not a good movie in both the context of overall movies and in The Mummy franchise. This movie is too much of a departure from the original two movies and it serves as an example where the flaws in the writing severely detract from the overall experience. This movie does a theme and setting change that is not executed well in the movie. The same old characters from the first two movies are present here but they do not exist in the same capacity as they were in the first two movies. The setting and characters feel different. Part of this can be attributed to the long time gap between The Mummy Returns and The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. The changes can also be attributed to the small switches in cast and the writing overall.The movie does have its moments in the action set pieces. They are nice to watch but they are ultimately hollow. The movie absolutely dragged when it came to the overall movie. The movie did not do a good job mixing its action and story scenes. Overall this made the movie feel incredibly forgettable and generic.I would not recommend 'The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor'.Grade: C",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
85,gigan-92,"Oh God, What Horrors Await the Viewers...",4,23 March 2010,"Damn it! DAMN IT!!! First, in most ratings you'll discover the first two films are excellent, but as soon as the third comes along things go downhill. Among the victims are the ""Jurassic Park"", ""X-Men"", ""Mummy"", and ""Halloween"" trilogies. Some quadriolgies also suffered from this coincidence, such as the ""Alien"" and 80s/90s ""Batman"" films. Very rarely do they start off good and continue to do so after a third. Several themes or 'puns' can be derived from this pattern, but the best two would simply be ""Three's often a crowd"" or better yet ""Quality over quantity"". That proverb should've clicked in the filmmakers' heads who would continue to make all those horrible slasher horror films that had NUMEROUS sequels (""Jason X"" and ""Halloween H20"" being two very poor attempts to keep a franchise going).Brenden Fraser returns, John Hannah as well, thank goodness. Somehow their son is a grown-ass man and the most horrible mistake ever possible is actually carried out: Rachel Weisz doesn't return as Evelyn. Oh @#$%, stop right there. As soon as her absence became a factor, the film should've been cancelled. But no, they went right ahead and if they don't realize their mistake now they never will. Secondly, the mood is way off from the first two and isn't played out very well if you ask me. To make things worse, the dialogue is so off-key it gets annoying not long into the flick. Jet Li killed the film off most definitely. He just doesn't belong here, sorry Jet Li fans, but the truth hurts, doesn't it? The only thing I did like was the dragon form of him, a blue King Ghidorah and that devil dog thing at the climax. And oh yeah, because trust me I did not forget, the score was garbage that grated on my nerves....Peace out.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

In Tomb of the Dragon, Alex O'Connell finds an ancient tomb, and accidentally brings back a Mummy back from the dead. Alex and his family has another challenge this time around. Jet Li was great as the Emperor Han. I like how different this movie is compared to the previous movies. It has no relation to the previous movies in any way.

89,nicholls_les,Watchable ...Just,5,21 November 2016,"I don't consider this movie quite as bad as some have made out. it isn't brilliant but fairly entertaining in places. The special effects were pretty good and the action for the most part not too bad. I don't get others problem with Rachel Wiesz being replaced as her character, played this time by Maria Bello didn't have very much to do.However the movie could have been so much better. It had Jet Li in it, it was set in China, it had some pretty good Martial arts. It had the incredibly good Michelle Yeoh, Russell Wong and Isabella Leong so it had all the ingredients of a great movie, but it just didn't quite get there.I think it hammed it up a bit to much and some of the cgi was silly. It seemed as if the director wasn't sure if he was making a spoof of Mummy/Martial arts films or an action movie, but he didn't do either very well.Silliest part was the Yeti's, there was no point to them and it almost made me turn off (I did watch this on DVD and I did fast forward a lot)I do think one of the problems with Hollywood, is that they never know when to end a series of films, (are we on Rocky 10 yet?) and the sequels seems to come out almost for the sake of it.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
90,policy134,Weisz is sorely missed,3,2 December 2008,"Not much to compliment. There is an utter lack of discovery to the exhausted movie franchise of The Mummy. While the first was an exceptional blend of breezy comedy and Indiana Jones-style action sequences, this is more like a demo video game, blended with boring exposition about the mission which the characters will undertake.Who cares about this movie? Certainly not most of the main cast. Brendan Fraser look extremely bored and John Hannah is for the most part totally separated from the action. Maybe he wanted it this way. He does give the best line in the whole disaster, involving the extremely ludicrous yeti battle. As for Maria Bello taking over the part from Rachel Weisz, the only positive thing you can say about her performance is she can almost fake a British accent.The part of the son, played by some Australian actor is totally uninteresting and he doesn't come off as anything but arrogant. A scene involving the bonding of him and his father feels more than a bit tacked on to please the audience, who for some reason needs everything to be tied up nicely (I can't imagine anyone who will).The most satisfying thing about this is Jet Li as the evil emperor but he is mostly confined to being a special effect. Michelle Yeoh, of Tomorrow Never Dies fame is completely wasted, as is the part of the daughter.So as for many of this summer's pop corn movies you can say this: ""It needs salt!""",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

And as is expected from this type of film, all Hell breaks loose.I must admit I've never really seen the second film but I liked the first one, but not that much. When I saw the trailers to this third part my interest was raised a little because it didn't look half bad and it had enough elements to get a half decent story going. So I went to watch. I can say it wasn't an altogether bad choice - the film does deliver some nicely depicted quick action scenes and it is funny at ends.But it isn't good action overall nor very funny overall. There's too many spots where it just drags on or repeats on earlier things done and all that and that just won't do in these times. It was fun though to see the terracotta army in action.

92,statuskuo,They Tried,4,14 April 2020,"While beautiful to look at, I am astonished how anemic the movie felt.
While director Rob Cohen (taking over for Stephen Sommers) knows how to start a movie, somehow this one gets muddled in too many logic flaws. And the worst thing that could happen to a movie, which is...the characters are dumb.I'm also perplexed on, casting of Luke Ford as the son, Alex O'Connell, when he appears to be in his mid-to-late 20's while Brendan Fraser seems to be in his early 30's. WRONG! At least give Brendan a greying beard or something. The guy is still yoked (for a 1940's guy who had been sitting around with no adventures in the last 8 years besides flyfishing?). Poor choices like this sink the ship.
And though we grew accustomed to Rachel Weisz's Evelyn O'Connell (which lingers with a heavy feeling of dread)...Maria Bello does do the best she can with weak material. To me, they probably should've casted an Englishwoman. But Bello seemed hot off of Jerry Bruckheimer reparatory troupe, so...why not?
This movie just has a very straight to video feel. Not that the concept wasn't an interesting one. It seems Jet Li was woefully placed as a ""favor gig"" to China-a-phile Cohen. He's not given much...like The Rock before him. To me, it's all wasted time to re-create a sense of wonder that was from the first one (""The Mummy Returns"" wasn't that great either. Looking back, it's actually a slog).A few others things that seem lazy is casting Michelle Yeoh, whom, as a witch, reads incantations in English. Can't explain why. And her daughter and her speak to each other in English, though...they speak Mandarin before that. Why? These things matter, and it seems lazy when they drop details, when this movie is all about details.
Though the production design is draw droppingly beautiful (Shanghai in particular), the cinematography of Simon Duggan does add a ton to the nostalgic feel of that era. It's glossy and it glitters, but the story really and resolution will leave you...flat. It was a nice attempt.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
93,beresfordjd,Too much of a good thing,5,26 December 2012,"If only there could have been more action in this film!! Actually the problem was too much action to the point of utter boredom. There was a pretty good idea at the bottom of the ceaseless action but it never really came to life. I mean did we really need Yetis and an animated terracotta army in the same film? Then to incorporate a three-headed dragon and an undead army was a bit much. As for the actors Brendan Fraser never looked convinced or convincing and Maria Bello is appalling as his wife, she just cannot act. John Hannah is so much better than a cheesy comic relief character and I hardly even remember the son - so bland he has no character. Yes the special effects are great, cgi well done but a movie needs more than just that to make it truly entertaining.

It seems they didn't improve things in this one. I liked the story and I did enjoy watching it a lot, but it was just let down in places.I don't like the idea of Rachel Weisz just being replaced by someone. Don't get me wrong, Maria Bello did an alright job, but Rachel should not have been replaced. I always believe if an actor or actress doesn't want to return to a franchise, then the character should be written out of the story. It doesn't work if you are watching the films in order and all of a sudden a new face is playing an old character.Another thing that didn't quite fit in this film for me was the fact that Brendan and Marias son in the movie looked as old as Brendan does. That is bad casting. I thought at first it was his brother!I liked Jet Li's character. I thought he was great. But then Jet Li is great in almost everything he has done (that I have seen so far).There were some creatures in it that I didn't like though. Halfway through the film there were these abominable snowmen. I actually laughed when I saw them. They didn't really belong in this movie and I think it would have been better if they found another way of doing it.I know I have said a few negative things about this film, but i honestly did quite enjoy it. It is worth watching as a movie, but try to separate it from the Mummy franchise as I believe it shouldn't be there.I will give it 6 out of 10.It's quite good, but it's also a film that didn't need to be made.

The should have just gotten rid of the character & had her be someone else. I remember the 1st Mummy film rather fondly for the time & thought the special effects were pretty good for the time as well. The special effects in this are actually worse than in the 1st film.

Yeah international audience and all that but wow this movie is going to tank in the coming weeks (I'm betting at least a 70% drop it's 2nd weekend in the U.S.) because the word of mouth on this is going to be bad.

There's no need to revisit something that's already on the beaten path as far as franchises go. It's just the same old same old with a new setting and some new monsters but not even those could save the film from it's own mediocrity. The script didn't demand much on everyone's part involved but when you lose one of the key and lovable characters from series past it falls apart literally. I miss the loss of Rachael Weisz, her character had charm and personality. And to recast her as Maria Bello was a disaster. her accent is awful and so is her acting. Brendan Frasier is good but he seems unmotivated by what's going on around him and is basically just ""going through the motions"". I could care less about his now teenage son because he's just simply lame and didn't add anything. Jet Li's barely in the movie at all. Most of the time he just walks around looking evil. Wow, what a great way to make a menacing villain, Mr. Director.The franchise wore out its welcome a long time ago. Part of the problem was that the producers, for some inexplicable reason, decided to give Ms. Weisz the ax and added an unexciting bland story that really doesn't go anywhere.

The reality, fortunately is not as bad as some would have you believe.Firstly, let's get the bad stuff out of the way. Brendan Fraser is half hearted as lead Rick O'Coonor. Maria Bello is spectacularly miscast as his wife. Her English accent is appalling, her acting wooden, there is no sexual chemistry between her and Fraser, and they both look too young to be the father of Luke Ford who plays their son, who again produces no chemistry with his ""parents"" and is hopeless. Mindful of the fact that Ford is 27, and Bello and Fraser 40, this is not surprising.The dialogue is risible,( Rachel Weiz saw the script, laughed and turned down the chance to reprise her role) and John Hannahs comic cameos descend into pastiche. But..................The action sequences are terrific. Although Director Rob Cohen clearly struggles with acting and drama, give him a big budget, and plenty of CGI and he delivers, as befits his track record with ""The Fast and The Furious"" and ""XXX"". Jointly financed with the Shanghai Film Corporation, the release date coincides with the Olympics to shamelessly exploit an interest in all things Chinese. the action shots in Shanghai are colourful and fast moving, the set piece battles a visual treat. Jet Li as ""baddie"" Emperor Han is excellent, but is sadly entombed for much of the story, making his contribution somewhat limited.Michelle Yeoh plays his nemesis, Witch Zi Juan, with considerable aplomb.Although the plot does not bear any sort of scrutiny, the running time just short of two hours does not outstay its welcome.The humour, narrative warmth and style of the first installment in particular is missing. In it's place is an all action ride which offers brashness and speed pretty much at the expense of everything else.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
101,barrys82,Enjoyable and recommendable but expected more,7,2 August 2008,"The Mummy 3 follows the same formula as the previous two. With tons of action and adventure, very good sense of humor, a story of magic and fantasy, excellent CGI and awesome special effects. The plot begins when Alex O'Connell (Luke Ford) found the tomb of China Dragon Emperor (Jet LI), an evil Chinese general pretends to bring the Emperor back to life and rule the world. It is Rick O'Connell (Fraser) and Evie O'Connell (Bello) to stop him and bring things to normal. But not everything is as good as it seems, I think that the time line of the movie is a little awkward and confusing, for example, Bredan Fraser and Maria Bello's characters are let's say on its 40's, so how could they have a son in his mid 20's. The cast is good only two actors from the previous movies are in this third. Brendan Fraser, whose performance isn't what it was on the other two, but it is still convincing enough, John Hannah with his character of Johnathan is the comical relief of the movie, Maria Bello is good but she is not Rachel Weisz, Luke Ford as Alex O'Connell was convincing enough and Jet Li was good but could be better, expected more from him.

Instead, we get a franchise that really is in its death throes.Jet Li is, instead, the de facto 'Encino Man', while Brendan Frasier is more like the 'Incognito Man'. Li is the legendary first ruler of China, who later became paranoid and drank poisonous potions to obtain eternal life. Li didn't get to show how paranoid and murderous he could have got. Instead, he had to fight Frasier with a dead army.Somehow, Brendan Frasier's son, Luke Ford, also gets a love interest. Isabella Leong gets to show she is no longer a Hong Kong starlet. But tell that to Frasier.I can make all the Encino Man jokes, but one thing remains. This film was average. The fighting was sometimes good, sometimes corny. I wish Frasier and Li got to fight it out. Instead, Li's army looked pathetic. And this film was Luke warm as a result. ""C""",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

That's right Rachel Weisz did not return to this third entry and instead we have Evelyn played by American actor Mario Bello - who does alright to be honest, still doesn't capture what Weisz had but enough to go by. What we also have is a 21-year Alex all grown up. Jet Li is the villain in the movie and to be honest I am not sure whether he was actually in the movie the entirety of the film as his character was dolled up with CGI. In other words, I wouldn't be surprised if he played a very small portion and the rest of the film where we see a rotting mummy or the emperor encased in terracotta in most of the film was just CGI. We have Rick who is trying to learn fishing by blasting his guns into the water, Evelyn promoting her new book titled ""The Mummy Returns"" while she has a writer's block for her supposedly third new book and Jonathon who opened up a casino in China which is named Imhotep's. Everyone seems to be doing fine but in reality, they thirst for adventure, which is where grown up Alex comes into play. The movie feels a different aesthetic in comparison to the previous two flicks, the director doesn't explain the stories or subplots correctly plus there is so much weird editing. Plus, during the firework battle during the car chase, did the people in the tram die after it blew up? And what is it with the script?? We have Jonathon going weird and hysterical when he sees Rick and Evelyn but in a non-Jonathon way plus he yells out spank me spank me to Rick - what the? The fight sequences felt dizzy and weird due to poor editing. The cool parts of the film where the CGI helped was the Yeti - the abominable snowmen. But once I saw a dragon, I knew this film past its due course for entertainment. Luke Ford who plays Alex is a miscast, the bloke doesn't get it right and I blame this to poor scripting. And what about a cool reunion between General Ling and both his lover and daughter? The story is thin and overpowered with all manner of special effects that leave nothing to the imagination, overall a poor film 5/10.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
106,curtis-8,"Should have been ""Mummy 2"" instead of lame ""Returns""",7,6 August 2010,"I just watched Mummy 3 on video. I'd stayed away from it when it played the theaters because of all the bad reviews. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. This was a fine contemporary adventure movie. At least the equal of the original in the new series. In fact, if you can forget that Mummy Returns existed, this one would stand up much better as a sequel to Mummy 1. (Forget about Scorpian King 1 & 2 as well). In fact they should have come up with a film like this AS Mummy 2 instead of just continuing that same storyline with the same Mummy. And while I think Mummy 3 is just as good as Mummy 1, I also have to say that it also suffers the same flaws--a bit too over the top with the SFX, a bit to frantic for its own good, and a bit too noisy. Will easily fall into the ""assault on the senses"" category for anyone over 30.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
107,stormhawk2021,Digging his own hole...10 years after,1,19 July 2018,"If you've:a) Never seen the first two Mummy films, but are aware of what they are,b) Like Michael Bay-esque dumb special effects pictures with quick-cutty action (cause God knows people seem to enjoy that crap),and c) Have no high expectations for entertainment, then you'll probably like this film.If you're smarter and have seen the other two Mummy films, going to this one is a major shift. If you thought 2 was different from 1, get a hold of this one. Especially when watching all the films in a row it is much more jarring than I remember it to be. I saw this on TV thinking it would be okay like the previous ones, but when it ended, I've turned off and I said ""It's AWFUL!""The main change in plot is that the mummies are no longer in Egypt, but in China and made of chocolate from Willy Wonka's factory, er...terracotta. Alas, the execution was poor, everything is tonally different. The way its shot and the editing is hardly consistent with the last two pictures, favoring a lot of cuts and congested camera framing, making action set pieces that seem potentially fun and silly turn incomprehensible and joyless. This film falls into CG syndrome and favors a lot of CGI effects that looks like a video game. Clearly, handing the film off to a director who's had a mediocre-bad track record was bad: this is Rob Cohen (the man who helmed ""Fast and Furious"", ""Stealth"" and ""xXx""); and a bad script written by the duo Alfred Gough/Miles Millar (""Shanghai Noon""/""Shanghai Knights"", and the then-TV hit ""Smalville""). Even the characters aren't as fun here. Brendan Fraser seems tired and has lost his comic touch (maybe cause he's ironically older in this film). For Evelyn's role, the original character is lost and replaced with one that doesn't hold a candle to the original one. British actress and Oscar winner Rachel Weisz did a phenomenal job portraying a cute, smart and feisty librarian in the previous ones; this time, American actress Maria Bello is filling her shoes, who in a stark contrast, transforms Evy into a soft and fluffy bunny of woman, speaking with an unconvincing English accent. She looks like Rick's mother than his wife and the chemistry between both was poor. Jesus, it's like to cast an American actor for James Bond or Harry Potter. Even Evy's brother, Jonathan, is reduced to bad comic relief; and even, a grown-up Alex, played by the 27-years-old Australian actor Luke Ford, looks like older than his dad (Hello! In 2008 Freddie Boath wasn't available, despite he was 17-years-old?). The saddest thing about both characters, Jonathan and Alex, was is that they speak with a fluid American (or maybe Canadian) accent when they are supposed to be Britons. The villain of this sequel is lame, while the previous mummy portrayed by Arnold Vosloo was terrifying, this new ""Mummy"", portrayed by Jet Li isn't intimidating and he had an only ONE fight scene.Something good...a pack of yetis who looks like white Teletubbies kicking the baddies' butts and then celebrating like football players; and finally the Dragon Emperor appears, who is actually King Ghidorah's twin brother rather a Chinese dragon. It's a shame that Godzilla or Ultraman didn't come, because they are Japanese, although of course, that to America doesn't matter, because China and Japan it's the same. What is it trying to be? Fantasy? History? Myth? It ends up being a cloudy haze of a mess.At the end of the movie, after defeating the Emperor, everything is happiness and fortune cookies for Rick and Co., and Jonathan says ""I wanna go somewhere where there's no mummies, like Peru"". Before the screen fades to black for the credits roll, a caption says: ""Soon after, mummies were found in Peru"", which hints a fourth entry that never happened: ""The Mummy: Rise of the Aztecs"". Maybe they will show Peru like Mexico or Guatemala in this fourth entry....we will never know.If we could've just waited for Stephen Sommers, a better script, and have convinced Weisz to actually join the film with the better script (she declined this film because she disagreed with the script used), we could've had a nice return for the characters. Unfortunately, this big, dull, joyless bland return for the franchise may be the last we ever see, and its a bad way to go. Surely isn't terrible? Maybe average, right? I'm surprised to say it really is terrible. Unwatchable? Yes, it is painful to watch as you certainly feel heartbroken and insulted to see that a chance for a return for these likable characters was wasted off on a poorly executed effort like this, and to know there's likely no chance in hell we'll get another attempt to do so ever again.P. S.: For all the reviewers who seem happy with the recast for Evie's role; yeah sure, maybe you'll say that Maria Bello deserved the role because she is much prettier than Rachel Weisz, just because in real life she is blonde. Hey folks, when ""The Mummy 4"" appears, don't expect for the British R. W. (Rachel Weisz) to decline once more to play as Evy, and then to be another blonde, the all-American R. W. (Reese Witherspoon) who plays a ""different Evy"" (an expert in martial arts and guns, learning Inca culture and Quechua language, speaking with an faux Brit accent, and voila! Here you have your new ""Evy Carnahan"" played by ""Elle Woods"") to see if you like her (I'll see you say that Witherspoon deserves the role of Evy, not only because she is prettier than Weisz, but because she is much younger and was born in 1976) or you feel heartbroken when Weisz doesn't had returned. Bon appetit.Also, I warn you that when that day comes, you're still sinning from being open-minded to that pointless changes, go watch ""Power Rangers"" instead, so you can see how they constantly recast members, season by season. Hey men, you're acting like Cassie Chan (Pink Space Ranger) with this attitude.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
108,The_Amazing_Spy_Rises,"It's more of the same (literally), but Rachel Weisz is sorely missed",5,3 August 2008,"I can honestly say that I was not disappointed by this film. But, that's still not saying much, as I was never the biggest fan of these films (I consider them to be B-class action films and Rick O'Connell to be a poor man's Indiana Jones), and saw this film just because I can see movies for free. The trailer really tells you everything you need to know about the film, so it is a highly effective trailer. The film is full of great visuals and awesome action, yet also infested with cheese dialog and is one of the worst scripts of the year. Even for your typical summer action/adventure vehicle, the script is horrid. Brendan Fraser's puns are even more distracting than they were in the past, and I also have other issues with the film that we'll get to in a moment.I'm well aware that the Mummy series is based in fantasy. That's a given. What struck me as odd is that this film is set 20 years after the events of The Mummy Returns, yet Brendan Fraser doesn't look like he's aged one bit, nor does he look like he's the father of the 26 year old Luke Ford, who plays the 20-something version of his son, Alex. Add in that the much loved Rachel Weisz is gone, replaced by Maria Bello, and you've already got major problems. They didn't even bother aging either Bello or Fraser. I would have appreciated some CGI induced wrinkles, or hell, hair with some gray in it. Rob Cohen didn't find that necessary, so he thinks you shouldn't either. Well I found it sort of distracting.To continue on a rant about Rachel Weisz absence, I think this is where the main problem of the film lies. However, don't take that to mean that Maria Bello is god awful or anything - she's not. It's not her fault Weisz opted not to return. It's pretty obvious to me that since she didn't return, the producers pressured a script that did NOT showcase the explosive chemistry between Rick and Evelyn (which was, let's admit, the BEST thing about these movies), instead featured the couple's son in a more prominent role. Luke Ford...eh...The kid tries, there's no doubt about it, but the script really doesn't allow for a ton of character development on him (besides the basics, and really, he's an entirely different character this time around). I also had a problem with his accent. He's the son of an American and an Englishwoman, yet he sounded Australian (which Ford is)...How did we get THAT? At least Bello's accent was convincing. Brendan Fraser has never really impressed me, and is one of my least favorite performers. This film is no different. Although, I think I may be biased against him.Yet ANOTHER beef I have here is that the execution of this film reminds me of Rush Hour 3. The end result is good, but unfortunately, it borrows so much from the previous films that it hurts the final product. A lot of events replicate themselves, and a pivotal moment from one of the previous films occurs again...just with a different character. Also, the film's climax left me wanting more.Now...after all that ranting, I can finally get to the good stuff about this film. First up, the strong acting comes from our Asian imports Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh. Jet Li has very few villainous credentials under his belt, but after this, I'm sure he'll get a few more offers in that department. He does a great job in the role, and seems to be enjoying every second of it...even if he doesn't speak any English in the film (about 1/4 of the total dialog is in Chinese with subtitles). Michelle Yeoh gives a gripping and emotional performance that is probably the best in the movie, and she goes above and beyond what the script has in store for her character.When it comes to our action sequences, Rob Cohen did a good job. We've got a healthy balance between gun fights, sword fights, old school warfare, and new warfare. It was actually really cool to see a huge army of soldiers run forward and get shot at by guns. I liked that idea. Although one unintentionally funny action sequence was when Brendan Fraser's character thought it would be smart to take on Jet Li's character in hand to hand combat. Hilarious.The film has good pacing that balances out a sometimes shaky camera that zooms too far. A lack of a decent score doesn't hurt, but it does leave the viewer wanting more. All in all, this isn't a terrible film, nor is it great. It's your typical summer movie that will give the viewer what they are expecting. Ultimately, however, I really think this could have been great had Rachel Weisz been in the film and the script could have centered more on Rick and Evelyn again.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
109,Maleplatypus,"Zombie Wars: The return of the empire that strikes back, and so on",3,14 June 2013,"This one is really easy to review: Good: Direction (given the ""raw material""), SFX (outstanding), some actors (and even that partially).Bad (horrible, even): Everything else.The legacy of Sam Raimi gone bad. Evil dead vs. good dead. Only a few actually alive people here. Lots of meaningless running, explosions and screaming. Even my dogs could predict next scene in this movie (and without watching it). Could be suitable for kids if the weren't so much killing. More yetis and less zombies than in Plants vs. Zombies. Among the ""undead breeds"", zombies definitely rule and are actually and often fun.

111,gregeichelberger,Tomb it may concern: Third time not a charm for 'Mummy' franchise,4,13 January 2012,"Originally published on Aug 6, 2008 The third film of a series oftentimes has a checkered past. Take, for example, ""Return Of the Jedi,"" one of the worst ""Star Wars"" movies ever. Then there is ""Superman 3,"" a truly awful addition the the genre, as well as ""Batman Forever,"" the third of the original Batman films.Now, that ""junior jinx"" has caught up with another franchise. ""The Mummy,"" a sleeper hit from 1999, spawned a successful sequel, ""The Mummy Returns,"" two years later; and now comes the third installment.Titled ""The Mummy: Tomb Of the Dragon Emperor"" (because they could not think of anything else to call it, I suppose) this movie comes in almost a full decade after the first hit movie screens. And while it's not horrid, it does nothing at all to enhance the series.Fresh-faced Brendan Fraser returns as the tougher-than-nails-adventurer Rick O'Connell (think Indiana Jones on steroids), who meets and marries Evelyn (now played by Maria Belo after Rachel Weisz's efforts in the first two) while mummy hunting in Egypt in the late 1020s.It's now 1946 and the couple's son, Alex (Luke Ford) is off on his own archaeological adventures - in China - unearthing the huge terracotta army of an evil-cursed and mummified emperor, Han (Jet Li).Rick is estranged from his boy (so we're told), so he travels to Shanghai, where - conveniently - Evelyn's brother, Jonathan (John Hannah), now runs a swinging nightclub.Meanwhile, a member of the Chinese army (is this the Nationalist or the Communists? The film does not indicate), Gen. Yang (Anthony Wong Chau-Sang), decides to revive the old king so he can bring ""order to a chaotic world."" How this can be completed is not dwelt upon too long, though, as a strange Chinese girl enlists Alex's help (as well as his meddlesome parents) to stab the cruel Han in the heart with a special knife. Never mind that he is supposed to be immortal, there are ALWAYS ""special knives"" in films like this.Just when it appears all is lost, however, there's an goodhearted witch who raises ANOTHER army, this one consists of the skeletal remains of workers who died building the Great Wall. The final battle then pits modern Chinese soldiers aiding the emperor's long-dead troops versus the O'Connells and their skeleton allies.One will need more bandages than a typical mummy wrapped around their heads to recover from this confusing conclusion.Certainly not the worst film of its kind, but it could have been much, much better. For instance, while many fans of Jet Li admire his martial arts athleticism, here he spends most of his time trapped in a dried chocolate suit, unable to freely move about and walking like the robot in the old Johnny Sakko TV series.Then, there's the terrible acting. Fraser and Hannah are charming, as usual, but Belo is badly miscast, while Ford is just plain awful. The movie also introduces some low-budget CGI, including yetis that bark, yell and carry stretchers (don't ask).Asian locations and some hint at the culture are pluses for this picture, and ""The Mummy: Tomb Of the Dragon Emperor"" should bring is some decent box office revenue (especially as a respite from ""The Dark Knight""), but that does not mean you should spend money to see it.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
112,shadowman123,Should of been the best one in the series !,6,29 September 2008,"I was actually looking forward to the third instalment of The Mummy Franchise, after all the first 2 movies were very good and worth a watch. However when you know Jet Li is attached to a movie , it will be nothing short of brilliant. However unfortunately Tomb Of The Dragon Emperoer just falls straight on its face . I mean from just watching it you see that it has all the right and perfect ingredients for a good night out however unfortunately that is not the case. The first flaw is that well , the poor acting I mean with the expectation of Jet Li who as usual was great but yet again it seems for this role that Hollywood has type cast into there is no preparation required , although watching him kick ass is great however the other characters just well had 'lets get it over and done with attitude' . Another thing was the CGI , most of seemed very blatantly fake and that the tone of the movie just feels like a mess and further more bad jokes being added to it just add insult to injury. I in many ways wanted to defend it but unfortunately the problems are very academic in it that anyone can see and they are hard to defend because the most disappointing thing is that you expect bang for buck and unfortunately you don't that here !THE MUMMY: TOMB OF THE DRAGON EMPORER6.7 OUT OF 10A NEW EVIL AWAKENS...",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
113,carlos37andre,Even tho it has plenty action scenes it manages to be quite boring,5,11 June 2020,"I'm gonna just write my lose thoughts about the movie next.It's insane how you put Jet Li in your movie and don't use his fighting skills.Why does he turn into monsters...? They never mention it in the 10 minutes opening scene, and suddenly he's a huge dragon, and then... a monkey thing? Idk.I didn't like the additions to the cast besides Liam Cunningham I found the new characters (and the new Evelyn, which had no chemistry at all with Fraser) quite mediocre to say the best. The romance between Rick's kid and the girl is obvious from the start. Like so many elements of the film.But when you compare with Mummy Returns for example, it doesn't have that truly bad part (even tho the Yeti thing is really stupid), it's just boring and predictable for most of the time. And besides Rick and Johnathan none of the other characters are likable. In other words, I would still rather watch Mummy Returns, cause of the first act, and also The Rock's CGI.At the end of the day, The Mummy: Tom of the Dragon Emperor isn't horrible (as I thought it would be) but is just a mediocre film, who doesn't know how to use the best skills of their own actors (like Jet Li), and fails on building new and exciting characters, that were surely thought at the time, to be a some what new face for the franchise. Obviously, it didn't work.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
114,kooleshwar,Tomb of the The Mummy Franchise,5,9 August 2008,"As i say this im well aware of the resilience of the Hollywood studios, how many movies have we prayed ""let this be the last"" but have still gone on to see 5,6,7 and THEN THE REMAKE.I guess we as much to blame as the producers.For what its worth this movie isn't really that bad.The special effects are decent for the obviously low budget, THEY AT PAR WITH THE ORIGINALS WHICH IS GOOD ENOUGH THOUGH BY TODAYS STANDARDS THATS SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE.The one liners are pretty good, i laughed at most of them, even though some of them were very childish and clearly aimed the children in the family audience that the producers hope will see this movie.In fact the humour in this movie is mostly good even though its obvious jokes have been included to appeal all sections and ages of society.The movie isn't long so by the time you realise that other aspects such as mystery excitement are missing the movies over.John Hannah actually stole show in this movie.The plot actually had potential but....AND HERE COME THE BIG BUTS..The actors looked bored and unconvincing, the entire movie had a feeling of lets get this done with, and it showed on screen and it definitely infused a similar feeling in me.The movie lacked the narrative and smooth flow that the original had, even though the original was longer you always had the feeling that somethings happening or will happen.In fact even though the plot had loads of potential (as much as sequels may have) clearly the lack of movie making skills has let down this movie.The movie feels like a bad remake of the first and second parts combined.The family sequences look altogether unconvincing and are quite irritating.There is lack of entertaining and interesting smaller characters that were aplenty through the earlier fims.STANDARD SEQUEL WEAKNESSES APPLY.Its not really that bad a movie, it has its moments, and the humour is quite good, also a suitable family movie.That being said this movie is at best seen in times of desperation (for example me and my friends stuck with nothing to do on Friday night), or the family not being able to make up its mind on which movie to watch.-s weak script, bored actors, standard sequel weakness.=/-s appeals to everyone??!!.+s good humour, never boring, John Hannah, maintains a now medium standard.total 5/10 (my original rating was 6 considering it met my low expectations but 6 crosses into good territory and you will only get that if you expect 5 which is OK so....)",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

Not as good as the previous two but it still is worth a look. Average visual effects, good battles scenes. A good movie to see with some friends.It was a big mistake changing from Egypt to China. It doesn't have the same effect. It was weird having terracotta moving statues instead of mummies and the mummy didn't even look like a mummy. I missed Egypt.Egypt wasn't the only thing i missed. I never thought i would say this but i missed Rachel Weisz. The new girl was so empty compared to Weisz.I recommend this if you liked the first two.

116,jemps918,They should've waited longer and stayed in Egypt...,5,3 August 2008,"Yes, this was pretty bad. If you're gonna do a third installment, especially after two successful Mummy movies, you gotta do it right. This one felt forced and very much unlike the previous two Mummy movies.Mummy 3 reeks of Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skulls; much anticipated but ended up a disappointment. Mummy 3 moved away from its Egyptian roots into China (timing it right before the Beijing Olympics?), so the myth was pretty much gone and everything else felt staged and, well, boring. Let's not even get into the use of yetis as deux ex machina!But it wasn't ALL that bad. Brendan Fraser is thankfully still spry enough to do his action scenes as adventurer Rick O'Connell. The CGI was good when the Eye of Shangri-la opened but everything else was pretty flat and didn't fit seamlessly with the rest of the scenes (such as when Emperor Han transforms). Rachel Weisz wisely didn't reprise her role as his wife Evelyn, and so the poor casting choice of the usually okay Maria Bello was saddled with the slack.Jet Li as the evil Emperor Han was mostly in terra cotta or CGI mode, so his charisma didn't really shine through, much like Michelle Yeoh as the good witch Zi Juan. John Hannah as Evelyn's opportunistic brother Jonathan Carnahan did not have enough witty lines unlike in the previous movies. Also surprising is the other casting conundrum of Luke Ford as the O'Connells' son Alex. He does look like Fraser, but he seemed too old for his still-young looking parents. Plus, he does not hold the same appeal as his younger incarnation in Mummy 2.They should've waited longer to produce a better script and stayed in Egypt in keeping with the franchise's theme.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
117,lyubitelfilmov,Those mummies again! or How to successfully ruin a good streak,6,15 November 2020,"Adventure. An unnecessary sequel to the previous 2001 film The Mummy Returns. I admit that I used to periodically look at this picture, but only because of Brendan Fraser and the shooting scenes, and how good it is that this sequel did not come out during my childhood, but oh well. Since this series of adventures is my favorite, then I will evaluate the final picture of the trilogy with maximum bias (because I do not like this picture), and here is my brief opinion - How to successfully ruin a good episode. Although I immediately have another question, ""Was there any point in starting at all?"" But, I will consider both the advantages (which are here) and the disadvantages that more and more influenced the assessment. Then let me start spreading this expensive miscarriage of Universal Studios.
So, the advantages:
1. Familiar characters - Rick O'Connell, Jonathan, mummies, adventure, humor, ancient secrets - how I love it. Rick again shoots at the hateful mummies that he is terribly tired of, but he can't imagine life without them, Jonathan is still joking (and funny at the same time), again the mummy rises from the grave and again wants to conquer the world (kudazh without it), again in front of the viewer the adventure unfolds. It was only thanks to all this that I looked at this picture, and for the sake of this review I reviewed it again.
2. Humor - despite occasionally successful jokes, its overall quality has decreased, and most of the jokes evoke a faint smile and nothing more. Stephen Sommers (the director and screenwriter of the first two parts) stayed here as a producer, but you don't even feel it, and the script was written by other people altogether, who of course cooked up a more or less decent script - but no more. As soon as Sommers left the script - and please.
3. Fights, chases, shootings - they look good, the scale is visible in some moments, it cannot boast of spectacularity, the battles are not at all pleasing to the eye. Only staging and jokes save.
So the disadvantages:
1. Where is Rachel Weisz and the real Alex? - this is a rhetorical question, since only they had enough intelligence and respect for themselves and the fans of the first two parts, so as not to spoil their images here - by refusing to act in this performance. It's a pity that only they did it, if Brendan Fraser and John Hannah had followed their example - then this picture would not have existed at all. Maria Bello as Evelyn is not a canon and a perfect emptiness against the background of the beautiful Rachel, not to mention the new Alex.
2. Self-repetitions - the series no longer knows where to go. Even the scene was moved from Egypt to China, but the essence remained unchanged - an ancient curse, a villain overwhelmed with a thirst for power, his short-sighted assistants and the O'Connell family, who will have to deal with all this as quickly as possible. And if Sommers tried to beat this scenario in the second part (and even mock it), then here it was turned several times, and it was completely unconvincing.
3. Why? - The box office success of the second part was obvious, so Universal decided to milk the cow while she brings cabbage. But there were no ideas for the third part. Sommers in the second has already made the most of this story. The best has never been and never will be. But the thirst for cabbage forced Universal to start developing an unnecessary sequel, while kicking Sommers out. The result is known. At home, it was a complete failure, which the creators did not count on, because in the final of the picture there was a hint of a continuation - which did not happen! HA! HA! HA!
A little about the main characters:
1. Rick O'Connell, played by Brendan Fraser, is a retired adventurer, but this is only at first glance, because his combat past will never let him go. Brendan does not play Rick here - he enjoys the fun, for Rick has long been part of Brandon.
2. Jonathan Carnahan performed by John Hannah - Evelyn's brother and the main comedian of the whole series, who holds more than half of the jokes. And even here he managed to cheer me up. An inconspicuous hero, without whom the rest would be very bad. John did a great job. Well done!
3. Qin Shi Huangdi performed by Jet Li - the first emperor of China, who is here called the ""Dragon Emperor"" or simply ""Emperor"", who put an end to the centuries-old civil strife and united under his rule all the kingdoms of China, and after all the accomplishments he wanted to become the ""ruler of the sea ""and so on. Jet Li is obviously working off the fee here - that's all. There are practically no emotions, only pathos, pathos and again pathos.
In 2017, the ""long-awaited sequel"" was released, or rather a restart called ""The Mummy"", which was so pathetic that even this picture seems to be a masterpiece against its background - and it successfully failed at the box office. Finita la commedia!
As a result, we have a watchable, but completely unnecessary continuation of a good adventure series, with good humor, Chinese entourage, several familiar heroes and famous actors, some of whom did their best.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
118,springsunnywinter,"Bigger, Faster, Louder & Better",10,1 August 2008,"If you were disappointed before the release of the film that Rachel Weisz is not back as Evelyn and Stephen Sommers (The director of the previous two Mummy films) is replaced by The Fast & the Furious director Rob Cohen, then good news The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is more brilliant, cool, awesome and amazing than the first two.I really liked the Mummy films and I was hoping that this one will turn out to be as good as the first two but it turned out to be better than them. I thought that The Scorpion King was the third installment of the franchise but it was actually a spin off and that was good as well. I was really waiting for the third part and it's finally out now 7 years after The Mummy Returns.The story takes place in China 1946 and is about Rick O'Connell (Brendan Fraser) and his wife Evelyn (Maria Bello) are now retired, but they must stop the resurrected tyrannical Han, the Dragon Emperor (Jet Li), a mummy awoken from a 2,000-year-old curse, and whose army was found by 18-year old Alex. The Emperor now wishes to rebuild his empire, and threatens to plunge the world into his merciless, unending service with his Terracotta Army. Their chances of stopping him are thin, for the Emperor has not only an army of great magnitude, but controls the five elements. The undead Terracotta Army faces another, smaller, raised-from-the-dead army made of the Dragon Emperor's enemies, who died when they were crushed under the Great Wall of China.The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is the biggest action adventure blockbuster of the year with jaw dropping special effects. The movie probably has the biggest special effects budget of the year. With all those dazzling visual effects including Yeties & Dragons you can see where the $175 million budget is spent. Maria Bello was a really good Evelyn and is Rob Cohen's best film to date. The movie was so good that it did not make me go crying to my Mummy.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
119,helmutty,It is made just for entertainment only!,7,2 August 2008,"When I was young, I remembered that I was scared watching the first and second movies. After some long years, the sequel is finally made. This time, it turns to be action-packed loaded with great CG effects. Its story is the weakest but who cares when watching action-packed movies with CG effects. Its actions and CG effects are the main appeal of the movie and do not expect more than those.The story: Like I said, the story plot is the weakest thing in this movie. I forgive that, the action and the CG effects make this movie entertaining. The director, Rob Cohen who did Fast and Furious and xXx, did a great job in the action scenes. The acting is great with some great humour. Now it makes me want to watch the first and the second movies again since now I am not scared of mummies.Overall: It is a blockbuster movie with non-stop action and CG effects which is not unusual. It is not bad but could do better. I am not afraid of saying this: I can't get enough of the action and hope that this would be longer. Those who can't get enough of big blockbuster movies like Hellboy 2, The dark Knight should watch this. After this, you will have to wait until next year summer for big blockbuster action movies. So watch it, I bet all the blockbusters this next year will make you crave for more. This will or may not help you wait until next year but it did help me.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
120,mr_popcorn,The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,3,23 September 2008,"Rick O'Connell: ""Here we go again!"" The blockbuster global ""Mummy"" franchise takes a spellbinding turn as the action shifts to Asia for the next chapter in the adventure series, ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor."" Brendan Fraser returns as explorer Rick O'Connell to combat the resurrected Han Emperor (Jet Li) in an epic that races from the catacombs of ancient China high into the frigid Himalayas. Rick is joined in this all-new adventure by son Alex (newcomer Luke Ford), wife Evelyn (Maria Bello) and her brother, Jonathan (John Hannah). And this time, the O'Connells must stop a mummy awoken from a 2,000-year-old curse who threatens to plunge the world into his merciless, unending service.Doomed by a double-crossing sorceress (Michelle Yeoh) to spend eternity in suspended animation, China's ruthless Dragon Emperor and his 10,000 warriors have lain forgotten for eons, entombed in clay as a vast, silent terra cotta army. But when dashing adventurer Alex O'Connell is tricked into awakening the ruler from eternal slumber, the reckless young archaeologist must seek the help of the only people who know more than he does about taking down the undead: his parents.As the monarch roars back to life, our heroes find his quest for world domination has only intensified over the millennia. Striding the Far East with unimaginable supernatural powers, the Emperor Mummy will rouse his legion as an unstoppable, otherworldly force...unless the O'Connells can stop him first.I admit, I was quite amused with the first two installments, it just seemed enjoyable at the time and it stars Rachel Weisz, one of my favorite actresses. The first two is admittedly just borderline ridiculous, but it was fun. The clone of Indiana Jones kicking mummified butt is just to good to be unnoticed.This one however, from the get-go, I knew would suck. Stephen Sommers, the director of the first two, dropped out so he can move on to making GI Joe. He was then replaced by one dimensional director Rob Cohen who gave us such atrocities like Stealth and xXx. That's the one right there, from this point on there is no doubt in mind that this film is destined to be on everyone's Worst Films of 2008.Bad became worse when Rachel Weisz decided she will not reprise her role as Eve stating ""creative differences"" as her main reason for dropping out. Creative differences also means ""Sorry, but the script sucked kthxbye"". A one-two punch to the third installment and I was becoming more and more uninterested to the project. The role of Eve then went to Maria Bello, I don't really know her work except for a couple of films but she wasn't really the lead so she's unfamiliar.Boy was I right after seeing this film. From the cheesy dialogue, horrible script, uninteresting character development and Maria Bello. Yes, Maria Bello in her worst form ever. She had the worst English accent I've heard and she just tried too hard to be the smart, cute lady the character's supposed to be. Its sad to say but she didn't match up with Rachel's clever take on the character. Then there's Brendan Fraser. I don't know what happened to him but the feel and aura of Rick O' Connell is just lost this time around. It seems like he's just uninterested to be in the film without Rachel Weisz and Stephen Sommers.There are however a couple of things that I found amusing in this gullible piece of trash. First, the Yetis. I would gladly have that as a pet so they can punt my worst enemies like it was football. Second, hot ninja Asian girl doing the hot ninja stuff and Jet Li who is made completely out of clay...and still kicks ass. Come to think of it, I think Jet Li's just about the best thing that happened to this movie but even he can't save this horrible piece in its hopeless plight.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
121,honorhorror,They are making fool of foreign cultures.,5,4 August 2008,"Mummy: tomb of the dragon emperor must be one, if not the worst, of bad summer movies. The reasons are following: 1, The set and the special visual effects are so cheesy, they can not even match the last two movies. Mummy set up new standards for motion-detection technology and has so many hilarious funny scenes. Mummy Returns may be not as memorable as the first one, but still delivers tons of fun and made money. But Mummy 3 completely falls short of people's expectation for special effects.2, Two of the greatest Kungfu masters in Chinese movie industry give appearances in the 3rd Mummy. The result? Booomm! They are equally bad because the director had no sense of utilizing the action heroes. The only fight between Michelle Yeon and Jet Li is so short and lame. yes, lame, I will use this word repeatedly. Their characters seemed so dull as if you are watching C-class cartoon. Such case can also be applied to the rest of the cast. Maria Bello and Brandon Fraser are still naive and their son seemed as mature as they are. A joke? 3, The story is maybe the lamest in years. There are simply no twists in the movie. Everything can be predicted. I was expecting to see some real actions even though I already knew the story is going to be lame. But to my disappointment, the actions are equally lame. There are virtually no exciting moments, not a single thrill, not even a little danger would the heroes be involved in. The Chinese zombie, or mummy, aka Immortal Emperor can transform himself into a 3-headed dragon(a European-style dragon) and a half-bear-half-lion monster. Sounds strong to you? Don't worry, he deserve a KO after 3 minutes' fight, we all know that, don't we? The conclusion is this movie tried so hard to pull multi-cultured elements together but finally become a funny monster. Compare to Kungfu Panda, which also promotes Chinese culture, Mummy 3 is an interbreed freak.5/10",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
122,gcsman,"Good fun, though not much more than that",5,26 March 2018,"The original The Mummy (1999) with Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz was a bang-up success, its sequel The Mummy Returns (2001) not quite so much, its spinoff The Scorpion King (2002) even less, and now a decade later we have Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008). Actually, it's not bad as popcorn entertainment which doesn't aim terribly high but delivers the goods that you more or less expect. For the purposes I used it for (something to watch in instalments while I was exercising at home), it worked fine.All the standard tropes of Mummy-type films are on display and the plot motors through them with a kind of cheerful energy: discovery of an ancient Chinese tomb, awakening of the evil Emperor (Jet Li) who, of course, intends to rule the world once again, an army of his undead soldiers, Shangri-La and a pool of eternal life, lots of kung-fu action, young romance. Brendon Fraser is back as the square-jawed Rick thrust not entirely willingly back into crazy adventuring, but Maria Bello replaces Rachel Weisz as wife/adventure-partner Evelyn who, after some initial resistance, plunges fully back into action-hero mode along with him. I though Bello did fine, but Weisz in the original pair of movies had an extra degree of charisma that is lacking here.The young-romance leads here are filled by Rick and Evelyn's now-adult son Alex (wholesomely handsome Luke Ford), a chip off the old devil-may-care block, and Lin (the beautiful Isabella Leong), secretly the immortal daughter of the custodian of the Pool of Immortality --- really, the only way to pick up on all the plot complexities is to go watch it on Netflix. Smaller but fun parts are filled by the always-welcome Michelle Yeoh as Lin's mother, and Liam Cunningham as crazy bush pilot Mad Dog Maguire. John Hannah is back as Eveyn's brother, the unrepentedly venal though inept Jonathan, but the third time around his character has become pretty much a bore. There are some surprising ""guest stars"" in the form of three Himalayan yetis, who are great fun. In the end this whole thing probably falls victim to its own complexity and lack of anything really new, but it's a good cast and a fun ride. Incidentally, pay attention to the end credits. They show fun graphics versions of the characters, along with a nice, driving, energetic score by composer Randy Edelman.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
123,BrickNash,Stylish but sorely lacking any soul of the prequels.,6,2 June 2013,"The Third sequel to the ever popular Mummy film comes along a hefty 7 years after the last instalment and seemingly from out of nowhere!One of the first things I do when a sequel comes along is check the crew list, more specifically the director. Now I'm not saying that a change in the head man is a bad thing, I mean look at Empire Strkes Back but the Mummy films were obviously a lovechild of writer/director Steven Somers and his not being at the help is pretty obvious.The main thing when doing a sequel to a really popular franchise has to be continuity. Without it fans lose their connection with the characters and the whole thing falls apart. Tomb of The Dragon Emperor is heavily guilty of continuity crime, the most glaring of these being that the character of Evy is no longer played by Rachel Weisz. This is a hugely bad move and it would have been ultimately better to have just written her out the story rather than expect the audience to re-adjust to a new face which, really doesn't ever happen even with the silly in joke provided.Other flaws come in the form of Alex O' Connell who has grown up from a bright nice little boy into some sort of gung ho rogue with little trace of the previous likable character. His accent has also very noticeably changed from English to North American which you just can not get away with from todays audiences and is either sheer laziness or simple apathy for the story on the filmmakers part.The characters that do return are obviously just in it for the paycheque. Fraser has lost his charm and sparkle under a pretty average script and John Hannah isn't even trying with his native Scottish accent slipping through on more than one occasion which shows his complete disinterest in the project.All this does is distance the established characters from the fanbase and as such the film seems empty and there is not much really to care about because they all seem like different people to the one's we know and love!It's not all bad news mind you, the films visuals are of a very high quality and all the sets and special effects are very good indeed. The shift to China from Egypt is a little strange but interesting though it serves as little more than an excuse to put some martial arts action in the film and with it come some pretty respectable names from Hong Kong cinema, though the fights themselves are very 'Hollywoodised' and not really a patch on proper Hong Kong fight sequences.Tomb Of The Dragon Emperor is really nothing more than a studio's attempt to squeeze some more cash out of a franchise it still holds the licence to and while the film has suitably stylish polish to it it's ultimately what you'd expect from such a venture. Empty, cold and none of the spritz and sparkle that made the prequels such great entertainment.Watch if you have to, it's not bad but you won't care enough about what's happening in the film to make it to the end.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

126,tom_koopa,"Far inferior to the two prequels, but still slightly entertaining",6,30 July 2009,"I loved The Mummy. I ADORED The Mummy Returms. I... was slightly entertained by Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon emperor.Characters return, the same humor comes back and several links are made with the prequels, but this movie just doesn't have the magic and suspense that the two previous movies had.The story is a little far-fetched, but it works I guess. A Chinese emperor is cursed and turns into a clay warrior (terracotta I believe it's called), along with his army. In the far future (20th century) he is brought back to life using the elixir of eternal youth (how convenient...). Now it's up to our Mummy fighters from the previous movies to put a stop to him before it's too late.The acting was a little... childish. I think they tried too hard to make this movie more 'kiddy' then the prequels. The previous movies had real scares and good, frightening moments. This film however wasn't scary at all, just a bit gory at times; but it's not much and usually looks a bit cheesy.However there is one good point: the CGI effects. There's a lot of creative eye candy in this movie. So this movie is slightly saved by the effects, but not enough to ensure a must-see status.Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is sadly a disappointment compared to the prequels. If you are a die-hard fan of the previous movies (mainly the characters), then go watch it. Just don't expect as much as you did with the prequels.In the end, this movie gets 6 out of 10 stars from me. Watchable, but not for more then once.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

128,RCWjr,Fun,7,2 August 2008,"My one-word summary pretty much says it all for me. Mummy 3 is, like the previous installments, a fun distraction from all the bad news that the front page of the newspaper reminds us of every day.Frasier is back as Rick O'Connell. Leaner and meaner from the last time we saw the character in 2001, Frasier brings the same A-game to what is essentially B-movie fun. Much has been made of Maria Bello replacing Rachel Weisz as Evie. Yes, Maria is no Rachel, but still, she is more than up for the challenge. Everyone involved seems to be having a lot of fun. It was great to have John Hannah back as Jonathan, he is always great to have around to lighten the atmosphere. Luke Ford is believable as Alex O'Connell. He has many of the same traits and physicality of Frasier's ""Rick"" that you believe this is what Rick and Evie's could would look like and act like. The effects, like in the previous films, are good enough to tell the story, but will not win any academy awards. Many miss that point; these films are supposed to appear lower budget and have predictable stories. They are homages to the films that the Indy series is steeped in. There is nothing highbrow here, but there is plenty of entertainment for a much needed distraction.Jet Li does a lot with saying very little. His Emporer is much like Imotep in that he spends a good portion of the film not in flesh form. He is given much more screen time than I thought he would. I did think there was a martial arts geek moment missed when the fight between Li and Yeoh was not longer. These are two of the greats and it would have been fun to see them go at it longer.The story is pretty much the usual fare for the Mummy films. We have an opening prologue that sets the stage and then our heroes stumble into the middle of everything and some how come out on the end. Simple, but fun story telling. All in all, great way to spend 2hrs just sitting back and watching the O'Connell's and Co. take on another adventure.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
129,jaredpahl,"Cheap, Dumb, Reasonably Entertaining Schlock, Drained Of The Series' Signature Energy",5,5 August 2017,"The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is stupid. The plot is goofy, the dialogue is banal, the actors are going through the motions, and the direction is ordinary. The thing is, nobody going to a movie called 'The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor' is expecting anything from these traditional pillars of cinema. This movie is made for 12-year-olds looking for something cool to daydream about and inner 12-year-olds who want a diverting two hours of adventure. On that front, how does this third Brendan Fraser led Mummy film hold up? Well, let's call it an admirable disappointment. From the perspective of a huge 'Mummy' fan, Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is a clear step down from the first two Stephen Sommers blockbusters. Mummy 3 lacks the energy, scale, and humor of The Mummy and The Mummy Returns, not to mention their director and star. With Rachel Weisz gone and Stephen Sommers relegated to producer, Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is clearly a lesser caliber popcorn blockbuster. For late summer entertainment, it gets by. The sets and costumes are pretty, the characters are likable, and the action is fun, but there is no escaping that old familiar feeling of franchise fatigue. The most noticeable change for The Mummy 3 is the ancient history the filmmakers plunder for the story. Gone is ancient Egypt and, ironically, mummies. The background of Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is ancient China, where a ruthless emperor, played by Jet Li, and his army are cursed by Michelle Yeoh's immortal sorceress to become terra cotta statues for the rest of time. Of course the emperor has to be resurrected, so retired adventurers Rick and Evelyn O'Connell, as well as they're grown son Alex, can go through another series of conventional Indiana-Jones-style exploits. This is the type of story where there is a sacred book, curse, or crystal to suit any situation. There are admirable attempts to bring some familial drama to the stock adventuring, but the bottom line is, this is dopey, schlocky stuff. Not that anyone really cares about the plot of a Mummy movie.What really matters in an action adventure like this is the action and the adventure. This is where Sommers' movies really shined, and The Mummy 3 comes up short. While the sets and locations are attractive (I can never get enough of hidden temples or secret tombs, and the Himalayan/ Chinese ones here are nice) the director, Rob Cohen, just doesn't have the skill or personality to bring the pretty pictures to life. Stephen Sommers is no Martin Scorsese, but when it comes to personality, energy, or even action staging, he is a major leaguer. Cohen is playing Little League by comparison. Still, what Cohen does with the action is satisfactory. The obligatory shootouts, fights, and chases are diverting, sometimes fun, competently helmed popcorn action. Brendan Fraser and John Hannah, two thirds of the charming and good-natured cast from the previous two movies, return, and they do what they can. The exception is Rachel Weisz, replaced by Maria Bello who tries her best, but can't match Weisz' natural enthusiasm. With Bello, everything seems forced. She looks like Weisz and behaves like Weisz, but she just doesn't have the spark that Weisz brought to the character.In any case, The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor can't quite pass this fan's summer adventure test. The filmmaking is subpar, and there are no surprises to discover. It's a hacky job from Cohen, who fails to make use of the lovely set and costume design, as well as Brendan Fraser's always-welcome manic energy. It's not impossible to enjoy The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. It's a high-concept popcorn adventure. That alone keeps me interested, but I can't, in good conscience, recommend the movie. For fans it will be a diverting but disappointing step down in quality, for those who never embraced the goofy Mummy franchise, don't bother.52/100",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

After the interesting opening, the movie seemed to take forever to get going (not the last of its dry spells), which really hurt the flow, and quickly became decidedly uninteresting. All the close-up shaky-cam action scenes didn't do the movie any favors at all either. The CG yeti looked like disgruntled bunny rabbits on steroids. Maria Bello is nearly unrecognizable.

First and foremost one should applaud Rachel Weisz, who does not even feature in this film! Due to her differences with the screenplay she decided not to continue her role as Evie. Although Weisz would of been offered a considerable amount of money to retain her role, she made a wonderful decision in light of this charmless picture. In fact one does miss her presence in this film, although it would have had little impact on its woefulness. Why have they decided to press so far into the future from The Mummy 2? Immediately you feel disjointed and unattached from proceedings, what had happened in the prior years? Bello and Fraser have not got the chemistry to help with this matter and Fraser lacks the panache and vigor of the earlier films.The screenplay is awful, the quips and asides which are mainly left to John Hannah are uninspiring. When you watch a film and you consciously begin to cringe at ensuing events, and get embarrassed by dialog you can only pity the time wasted. The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is bland, one-dimensional and lacks any imagination. Films obviously have to make money but to produce a film which comes without any heart, and to do it with such obvious disregard for fans of the previous films is upsetting.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

Rachel and Brendan and an amazing chemistry, but Maria Bello was abysmal as the new Evelyn. Her fake British accent and melodramatic acting was inexcusable. The sets looked like they were built by 3rd graders, the effects were overwhelming, the scenes were disjointed and the cheesy one-liners got old fast. Sure, Brendan Fraser still looks hot in a tux, but he still looks 35 even though his son is in his young 20s. Overall, I was terribly disappointed.

So what if it wasn't set in Egypt...why fault the producers for trying to keep it fresh? If they make another I would like it to be set in the Byzantine empire...nothing is ever done about that tremendous civilization, its as if it didn't exist for over a thousand years??

Going into this movie you have to expect unrealistic and weird things to happen. Nothing in this movie is believable really. The movie it's self though is entertaining and fun. The visuals in the movie were very cool as well. The movie even had a few laughs as well. Brendan Frasier did a really good job and was pretty funny as well.

136,simonparker1990,Raised from the dead,8,7 August 2008,"I'm going to risk a lot of my very tiny amount of credibility by praising this movie. I'm aware straight off I am in the very small minority of people that actually enjoyed this movie, I realise I'm also in the even smaller minority of people who would like to see a fourth Mummy movie as a result of this, but the truth is, as naff and as flawed as this movie truly is, I haven't had as much fun watching a movie for a long time. The Mummy series was very hit and miss, the first movie being brilliant and a definite hit, The Mummy Returns being fun but ridiculous and the ending destroyed the film, The Scorpion King (not really part of the series) was a disaster and I would rather have my eyes gouged out that watch it again. But this latest effort, despite the high criticisms, I found to be the second best entry in the series. The movie is fast paced, has some good action sequences and its also very entertaining. Sure the lack of Rachel Weisz is noticeable, while Maria Bello does a half decent job she just doesn't replace Weisz. The movie also has a huge tendency to go very over the top, yetis anyone (yes you read that), but then again lets face it this series has never been one for being subtle. While its as stupid as can be I really enjoyed the movie and am willing to be scaved as a result of enjoying it.So onto the performances. First off is Brendan Fraser returning on leading man duties. Fraser in my eyes is a very competent and fun leading man. He was one of the highlights of Journey to the Centre of the Earth (once again another surprisingly good movie, also in the minority for liking it here), and he stole the show in the past two Mummy movies. In this third outing he admittedly is not as good as he was in the original movie, yet he is still an interesting character. Fraser delivers his usual, generally quite funny puns, has some great action moments, and just seems so likable. Maria Bello is the one getting the most criticism out of this movie, really its quite obvious why. Everyone misses Rachel Weisz, hell I did, and Bello just doesn't live up to her. Still once you get over that, it only bugged me for the first half hour, you realise despite a slightly dodgy English accent Bello is more than competent enough to pull it off. Her and Fraser have chemistry together, not as much as Weisz had though, and they make the scenes more fun when they are together. Jet Li does a competent job on lead villain duties, while his Mummy is nowhere near as menacing as Arnold Vosloo's Imhotep he still manages to do a good job. Michelle Yeoh is brilliant in her all to brief screen time, but her scenes in the prologue really are superb. John Hannah returns as Jonathan, and once again has some very funny stuff, although his scene with a vomiting yak are questionable at best. I suppose the one weak link of the cast has to be Luke Ford as Alex, the little kid from the second movie. While he isn't as bad and annoying as the kid from the second movie, the grown up Alex is lacking a personality to be blunt. He's alright, but I'd have preferred he'd have been left out of the movie.The third Mummy has left Egypt and gone off to China, when I first heard this I was horrified. While I still do prefer the Mummy movies being set in Egypt, the setting of China did surprisingly work and the whole Teracotta army being the Mummy's is actually a decent idea. As I've previously mentioned this movie does get a tad silly. The yetis are the most questionable aspect in my eyes. While they are not as bad as I feared, I just cannot make my mind up about them. They have a cool action sequence, and to some extent their point in the movie is explained, but seriously yetis? A three headed dragon appears at some point as well, as well as a big wolf/dog monster thingie which I can't explain, they're pretty cool though and they are explained. The action is undeniably cool in this movie, a chase through Shanghai being my personal favourite, and the clash of two undead armies being a close second. The one fight that does fall flat on its face is between Michelle Yeoh and Jet Li, while it gets set up quite epically, when it actually happens the fight is pretty bland. Just an average sword fight that quickly ends. The script is about average, but Mummy movies have never been known for good scripts really, just the action and entertainment value.So overall The Mummy 3 in my eyes is a good action movie that I will quite happily watch again. While its nowhere near as good as the original movie, it is a hundred times better than the second movie and The Scorpion King. Rob Cohen does a decent job of resurrecting a dead series, but then again as I've said I'm in the minority here, so whether we get a fourth movie or not is very questionable.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
137,margulanabutrlov,The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor Review,10,23 March 2019,"It's 1947, and retired adventurers Rick O'Connell (Fraser) and his wife Evelyn (Bello) are summoned to China for one last job. But things get complicated when they turn up to find that their archaeologist son, Alex (Ford), has found the mummified remains.
We never thought we'd say this, but where's Stephen Sommers when you need him?
The previous Mummy films - particularly 2001's The Mummy Returns - may have suffered from Sommers' penchant for extraneous characters, overblown action sequences and decidedly ropy CG, but at least they were fun. They bounced along at a jolly old pace and had, in Brendan Fraser's Rick O'Connell, a have-his-cake-and-eat-it-too action hero who poked fun at ridiculously overblown machismo while simultaneously slyly indulging. But Sommers is merely a producer on this belated addition to the franchise. Parachuted into his place is Rob Cohen, director of Stealth, and while he tries valiantly to keep things breezy, ultimately Cohen's Mummy movie is a cold and lifeless husk that could have done with a big injection of the F-word.
The Mummy movies have always invited comparison to the Indy series, and those comparisons are more apt than ever this summer - especially when the opening reintroduces us to a very different Rick O'Connell. Bored, missing the juice of the hunt, like Indy, he's the mythical hero, coming to terms with his own mortality. But this thread is dropped just minutes in when Rick and Evie (Maria Bello, replacing Rachel Weisz in body but not in spirit) recant their retirement and head to Shanghai, where - as luck would have it - their son Alex (Luke Ford), and Evie's brother Jonathan (John Hannah, stranded as the comic relief to such embarrassing effect that you want to hug the poor sod), are currently stationed. And then Li's Emperor is awakened and all hell breaks loose.
Well, tumbles loose might be more apt. There are decent ideas here - a chase through the streets of Shanghai is enjoyably frenetic and a battle between Han's terracotta army and thousands of zombie soldiers showcases above-average effects. But too often the pacing is one-note and hampered by Cohen's decision to shoot much of the action with a Bourne-style shaky-cam. For a franchise as determinedly old- fashioned as this, it's a jarring choice. As for the big fights, they're a huge disappointment - the much-hyped clash between Li and Yeoh is blink-and-you'll-miss-it stuff.
But most of the film's problems stem from its clunker of a script, by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, riddled with clunky exposition, wafer-thin characters and plot developments that should be a giddy, pulpy delight, but which instead feel cold and devoid of real inspiration.The appearance of a friendly group of Yetis about halfway through, for example, is a world away from the audacious giggle it should have been.
Far more disastrous, though, is the decision to shift most of the focus from Fraser onto Ford as Alex, Rick and Evie's chip-off-the-old-block son, presumably with one eye on future sequels. Notwithstanding the fact that Fraser looks like he could be Ford's older brother, the newcomer is a charisma-free zone who may bring a certain physicality to the role, but can't compete with Fraser's carefree charm. Having said that, Fraser's O'Connell here is a poor facsimile of the cocky chancer who lit up the first Mummy. The wisecracks are tired and infrequent, the heroics forced and routine. And for a series that may be named after its villain(s), but derived its spirit and drive from its hero, that's an glaring flaw.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
138,I_Love_Spielberg,"Not as bad as people are saying, but still the weakest of the trilogy",6,23 June 2009,"""The Mummy: Tomb Of The Dragon Emperor,"" takes place 13 years after ""The Mummy Returns"" where Rick and Evie O'Connell have retired, and their son is out of the house and digging up mummies. But once he digs up an old Chinese emperor that, as usual, has a curse upon him, he and his parents are in for trouble. When I heard who was going to do this one and who was going to be in it, I was really skeptical. I thought this movie was going to be a total failure because it didn't have Stephen Sommers in the director's seat like he was with the first two, and it didn't have Rachel Weisz playing Evie like she did in the first two; it had Maria Bello instead. So, I was really skeptical about it, especially Maria Bello, as good as she is, and I thought she was really good in ""Secret Window."" Still, I wasn't sure. But then, I saw it, and it exceeded my expectations. It really did. I thought Maria Bello did a really good job of filling in Rachel Weisz's shoes, even though I still prefer Rachel Weisz to Maria Bello. Now, even though it did exceed my expectations, it still had some things that could've been done better. Some of the writing could've been better in some places, and the visual effects weren't that great. They were just cartoonish, and the sad thing is, ILM has done movies where the effects look realistic, so I wonder why they wouldn't do the same thing to this one. Having said all of this, even though it exceeded my expectations, I consider this one the weakest in the trilogy. But I'll still watch it whenever I get the chance.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
139,andell,This Story is Terrible!!!,2,1 August 2008,"First of all, I have to say that I am no fan of ""The Mummy"" films. I think the general overtone of them have been asinine to begin with- and the only reason I even chose to watch this film was because seeing Brendan Fraser wearing a bomber jacket that holds a very erotic overtone for me was something I was really excited to behold.And Brendan looked great in that bomber jacket...really attractive- however it wasn't enough to save this colossal, annoying, absurd film.The story follows that Rick and Evelyn have retired from their Mummy searching odysseys and are living a life of luxury and retirement that most would dream of, but they are bored of. By contrast, their son Alex is off in China, having quit school and partaken in a dig that will unearth the biggest find since King Tut! Bizarre, eh? Why send kids to school when they can quit and find glory? As it turns out however, the dig is really a cover for a Chinese military factions effort to resurrect an evil King who has control over the elements, and plans to conquer the world.Throw into this an insipid farce with Alex falling in love with the very young looking 2,000 year old daughter of a witch, who seems every bit as naive as him, Evey's especially useless brother making an obnoxious nuisance of himself over and over, and resurrected armies that could've been taken by Barney and his gang, and what you have is a complete and utter waste of time! But if you relish the idea of Brendan Fraser looking sexy in a bomber jacket for twenty minutes or so, the movie isn't a total flop. LOL",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
140,cyclone259,All we are is dust in the wind...,4,2 February 2009,"It's difficult to add different commentary to the numerous quotes by others who didn't care for this stumbling, misplaced adventure and third installment in The Mummy series.I'll start with my first point of disdain, the most obvious being the departure of Rachel Weisz and the obvious lackluster performance of her replacement, Maria Bello. I can't judge Ms. Bello on previous endeavors, but in this incarnation, Ms. Weisz was sorely missed. Maybe it's just my own preference, but I can't stand it when a studio just thinks the audience won't notice when a major character is 'poof!' replaced by someone completely different (think Jodie Foster as Agent Starling from 'Silence of the Lambs' to Julian Moore in the same role). Actors bring their own personalities to the table (we hope anyway) to who they portray on the screen. Personally, I'd been OK with Evelyn O'Connell's absence (ie. divorce, etc.) but, instead we were forced to endure Ms. Bello. While I realize that The Mummy 3 isn't 'Sense and Sensibility' by any stretch, Ms. Bello took the movie down about 10 notches for me and ended up being a distraction.One of the most glaring issues, was the grown-up son of the O'Connell's. While fans of Brendan Fraser will admit that he's a nice-looking actor, even nice-looking actors age and I didn't buy that his son was in his 20's. I'm sorry, but Luke Ford doesn't look anything like Brendan Fraser and if I remember correctly, the actor who did play their son had a British accent. Before I'm criticized for this, yes I know it's NOT the same actor(s), but it would've been nice to have some continuity from the earlier movies, especially since we're expected to buy the complete character change I mentioned before.The Mummy is all about suspending belief, as a lot of sci-fi, fantasy and adventure movies are, but c'mon... throw us a bone. When you only have one or two of the major players from the original films, something might tell you 'hmmmm... maybe we shouldn't proceed'. It's like all of those reunion rock band tours from the 70's and 80's with only the soundboard guy and the drummer left. As others noted, it looks like they did this one to make a buck and I can say I wholeheartedly agree.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
141,movieman89-2,The Mummy? Are you sure?,3,9 April 2010,"I am a huge fan of the mummy films, ever since I was young, especially the second film.I did read things about this the magazine Empire. I felt unsure about change of director. I was very concerned about changing the actress of the character Evie. I watched it and I'm not really impressed.The story is not too bad, it still keeps you involved.The scripting was laughable and too cheesy. It kept on reminding us that this was somehow a sequel to the first two. For example the quote ""Yeah, same mummy, twice!. Also, Jonathan's night club called Imhotep, which was the mummy's name in the first two.Marie Bello as Evie was terrible, she was trying to hard with her English accent. I miss Rachel Wise, who was awesome as Evie.The most annoying thing was what they have done with the O'Connel's son, Alex. Luke Ford was awful and annoying. He came across as arrogant and annoying. There is also a big continuity mistake with him, he was not American in the second film.The effects on the mummy were not right. I ended up calling him Clayman instead of the mummy. Jet Li, don't get me wrong, a good martial artist and good actor usually, but this movie seemed like an excuse to see him with his martial arts.Overall, it was rubbish but with some good points. I would rather start off with the first two mummy films which are much better than this.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

143,Red_Flag,A franchises best left dead and buried,1,18 August 2008,"""I've seen enough mummies to last me a lifetime"" squeals John Hannah minutes before the awakening of yet another mummy. And, as poor as the line might be his is painfully accurate. I have seen enough, period! Yes I am quite obviously talking about the third (and hopefully last) in The Mummy franchise. That's not to say I hate this series in general. Part one was a fun but fatally flawed roller coaster that managed to entertain. But with part two majorly short-changing its audience on plot and or characters it's hard to get excited about this really.Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is such novice textbook film-making that it's almost impossible to care about any of these characters, you don't fear for them because you know they're going to come out of this smelling like roses. This is the very definition of PG13. And it's in the oh so textbook screen wrighting that Tomb of the Dragon Emperor really fails. You do not accidentally have a scene in which a yak throws up just so you can say ""The Yak, yakked"".But that's what John Hannah's for, he's Mr Obvious. He's the guy going around pointing out objects just to patronise s its audience even more. ""An avalanche"" he screams. Boy it's a shame it didn't kill him.There's your second problem. With the introduction of new characters and no room to explore them it's almost impossible to care about them. Its actors therefore wasted. And no I'm not talking about Brendan Fraiser his career was over long ago. No I'm talking mainly about Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh two of my favourite martial artists who have clearly lost their way. Jet Li shamed his creation with the Americanised garbage The Forbidden Kingdom (one of the few movies I have walked out in) and whilst I can judge without seeing it, Yeoh's Babylon A.D. sure doesn't look like a masterpiece.The Fast and the Furious director Rob Cohen continues the tale set into motion by director Stephen Sommers with this globe-trotting adventure that finds explorer Rick O'Connell and son attempting to thwart a resurrected emperor's (Jet Li) plan to enslave the entire human race. It's been 2,000 years since China's merciless Emperor Han and his formidable army were entombed in terra cotta clay by a double-dealing sorceress (Michelle Yeoh), but now, after centuries in suspended animation, an ancient curse is about to be broken. Thanks to his childhood adventures alongside father Rick (Brendan Fraser) and mother Evelyn (Maria Bello), dashing young archaeologist Alex O'Connell is more than familiar with the power of the supernatural.VERDICT: If you enjoyed the atrocious part two you may just find yourself enjoying this. Everybody else will just scoff. You've seen this all done before, you've seen it done much better. If there's anything The Mummy 3 is good at it might just be at reminding us how much better Indy 4 was. With respect, I think it's about time to lay the mummy to rest.

China I don't know... whats so scary about a reanimated terracotta statue and a rebel communist faction?

145,powerfull_jedi,"Mummy 3 shows signs of fatigue, but this has spunk",7,30 November 2008,"During Dr. Jones's long hiatus, at least two characters have been successful as adventurers/tomb raiders. We have Nicolas Cage as Benjamin Gates as a smart scholar/treasure hunter, the other one is no other than Brendan Fraser's Rick O' Connell, in two action packed films that pray tribute to the old Mummy movies. A third movie as been a long time coming, I missed the film premiere, but I rented the DVD yesterday, so does this movie fly like an eagle or does it just crash and burn?Taking cues from the original film, we get about 10 minutes worth of an evil Chinese Emperor(Jet Li) who seeks out an attractive sorcerer(Michelle Yeou) that can give him everlasting life,however, his own general steps on his toes and pays with his life, the sorcerer then curses the emperor and his army which in turn are turned into stone. It's an unusually long setup(it almost feels like another movie) and it takes even longer to jump start the actual plot.Right off the bat, continuity is a mess, Brendan Fraser and Maria Bello(filing in for Rachel Weisz) are now apparently retired, seeing how this now takes place 10 years after the second movie. However no of them look any older than they were 3 years ago, yet self-referencing age jokes proliferate in this one, which is an odd choice. It might fly with Indy, but Brendan Frasier hasn't even turned 40! Anyway, continuity is a complete mess, Rick and Evelyn look like they barely aged at all, yet they've already retired, but his son goes from a British boy to an American-speaking treasure hunter and colleague dropout(what's with this obsession nowadays?). He also seems to be enamorated with a mysterious girl who seems to be guarding tombs. Evelyn's brother returns, but this time given much less to do, aside from being comic filler. Maria Bello isn't quite a miscast, but Rachel Weisz's absence makes her interaction with the other actors feel awkward, at least to me as a viewer, but c'est la vie.Like I stated before, the plot takes forever to get going, it really starts at the 30 minute mark, when the crew suffers an unthinkable betrayal to help an aging Chinese extremist general resurrect the dragon emperor. Aside from that, and the continuity goofs, this third installment is a satisfying, if average action movie. Nothing that you see here is remarkably different than the older films. As action set pieces rage on and quirky one-liners are mixed with the usual family torn apart sub-plot, with Rick and his son's occasional arguments about everything from him not taking his son seriously as well as weapon analysis.As far as acting goes, Brendan Frasier is a notoriously bad actor, but the Mummy movies and well as the new Journey to the Center of the Earth, really make him stand out as a decent action movie star, there's some charm and I do appreciate the references to the earlier movies. Luke Ford takes a while to get used to, as he sorta fades in and out of focus, especially before he reunites with his parents, afterwards, he is mostly stuck with action pieces and his romantic subplot with Isabella Leong's Lin, who later reveals herself as the sorcerer's daughter. Jet Li is always a welcome addition to this film. I guess he does OK as a villain, but then again with a fully fleshed out back story, who wouldn't?",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
146,~AleXa~,The Mummy half-digested and regurgitated in China,5,13 February 2014,"The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2011) Reviewed February 8, 2014 after 1st viewing (Blu-ray) Universal – Directed by: Rob CohenThe Mummy half-digested and regurgitated in ChinaDisappointing to say the least Mildly entertaining to say the most. I am a huge fan of the first two films in this series, however once I found out that they were proceeding with this movie without the lovely and talented Rachel Weisz, I knew it was doomed for failure. That is one of my cardinal rules for sequels beyond a credible, well-written plot—You MUST retain your original core cast members to have a CHANCE of success with certain exceptions of 4th installments that are set further in the future and revamp the series for a new audience (i.e. Terminator Salvation, Scream 4, etc.) The second biggest mistake is to switch directors mid- franchise, particularly when the originals were written and directed by the same person. No one will ever treat your creative genius the way you do, as seen in JP III for example.It starts off well enough, with an engaging back story shot on location for the classic grand scale effect. Cut to Rick attempting to find new, inventive things to do with his time, and we watch a refreshingly humorous show of his true nature. We then see the same mansion we saw from TMR, a nice bit of nostalgia. Then we find the O'Connell's in their home—and it happens. We see Maria Bello with her dyed hair and what can only be one of the worst English accents in cinematic history, which comes and goes as the movie drags on by the way.When we meet Alex, Rick and Evey's son, he looks more like Rick's blond younger brother. I still don't understand why they couldn't have set the time of the film for him to be an older teen. Nonetheless, from this point forward, it's just a convoluted mess of resurrecting the same plot elements from the first two films set in China. The story jumps around quite a bit and we meet two new characters, neither of which are that interesting. Same 'ol, same 'ol about immortality. And on that note, apparently mummies are not the only creatures that are fair game in this one. It becomes a free-for-all with Yeti's, shape-shifters, stone horses, and the like. There is no cohesiveness nor connection to the audience; it just all seems so incredible and far- fetched, and as much as I loved the first two films, I just found myself not caring about the journey because I knew what would happen in the end. Sad to say, but there is absolutely nothing original in this film. The director just chose to runaway with his imagination and budget, not caring about the quality or substance of the story the way Stephen Sommers did. There is just no chemistry between Fraser and Bello whatsoever, and that's saying something. I find it interesting that they have romantic scenes hardly ever, as if the director knew they had no chemistry and tried to avoid it as much as possible. In one of the pivotal plot points, they think they're changing it up by switching which character nobly sacrifices their own well- being for that of another. And the predictability continues.In conclusion, this movie was maddeningly mediocre and formulaic, but that's what you should expect when the creator abandons his creation. I do not lament in the least not seeing this one in the theater, but it pains me that we will never see what could've been a worthy conclusion to a wonderful trilogy. They waited seven years—they could've waited a few more for a better script, Sommers to direct, and Weisz to return. Heartbreaking.4.5 out of 10.0",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

150,janos451,Mummy Chop Suey,3,30 July 2008,"""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" is an indelicious admixture of Hollywood and Hong Kong exploitation flicks. To be precise, it has three of the four basis elements of the genre: gratuitous violence, special effects and assorted mayhem, yes; naked flesh, not so much. Oh, well, you can't have it all. Still, this ""Mummy"" tries very, very hard to do all, to be all, from an intergalactic-sized avalanche, to abominable snowmen flying through the air (if Yeti are always men, how does the species survive?), to one of the least convincing romances in movie history - between two ghastly young principal actors, Luke Ford and Isabella Leong.Their underachievement, along with embarrassing performances - in the leading roles, no less - by Brendan Fraser and Maria Bello is all the more significant in the starry presence of Michelle Yeoh and Jet Li. A mix, indeed, ugh.One must believe in mummies in order to source the current overwhelming curse on Hollywood, of countless comic-book, super-hero, special-effect permits to print money with movies devoid of (non-monetary) value. And now the blitz has gone multicultural, but not in a good way. This third film in a series hearkens back to the fictional Emperor Han (another mix here, of China's real first emperor, Ying Zheng, also known as Qin Shi Huangdi, and of a ruthless character in search of eternal life), his betrayal of the wizard (Yeoh) who could have helped him, and her curse on him. Han is Jet Li, not so much a mummy as a flaking metal statue, almost constantly on fire, and fairly walking through this misdirected mess. The misdirector is Rob Cohen, of ""The Fast and the Furious,"" someone who can provide scenes, but nothing beyond them.From the opening scene between Li and Yeoh, establishing the origins of the story, ""Mummy"" moves to an exciting fly-fishing scene in England, where retired Indiana-wannabe Fraser hooks himself in the neck. Things get worse when he goes home to a similarly retired but more cheerful and less awkward wife (Bello) for an evening of strained inactivity. Ford is their son, skipping school in China to discover the whole Han terracotta army and the mummified/metalized/fire-breathing emperor. And so it goes, for 112 minutes. (The Korean version is one minute shorter, and one wonders which crucial 60 seconds Koreans have been denied.)",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
151,rbsjrx,"Ignore the reviews, make up your own mind",7,9 August 2008,"I almost didn't see this in the theater due to all the bad reviews. What changed my mind was Roger Ebert giving it a rare positive review. Since I agree with Ebert more than most critics, I decided to go see it.I have to say that none of the reviews or comments I've read tell the whole picture, IMHO. Neither Ebert's praise nor other critics' pans are entirely appropriate. Lets' start with the basics... ""The Mummy"" was a modern retelling of a 30's ""B"" monster movie with up to date FX. It wasn't great drama, but it was a rousing thrill ride that capably did its job of entertaining you if you weren't too picky about plot, etc. The two sequels have continued this tradition. I'd rate this as inferior to the original but slightly superior to ""The Mummy Returns"".Much has been made about the casting of Maria Bello in the role originated by Rachel Weisz. While I'm not a Rachel Weisz fanboy, she is a very capable actress and I just don't believe Ms. Bello was up to the role. There is simply no chemistry between Bello and Brendan Fraser. There are basically only two legitimate reasons to make a sequel: 1) either there are loose ends to tie up, or 2) people really like the characters and want to see more of them. Each film in the Mummy franchise ties up its own loose ends, so the producers are risking commercial suicide to change the characters in any significant way. If they couldn't get Rachel Weisz, they should have been much more careful in recasting the role. There's very little physical resemblance between the two actresses, and Ms. Bello simply doesn't seem to have the acting chops to carry it off. That unfortunate casting choice casts a pall over the whole enterprise - but not enough to sink it.Some have criticized the film because they don't believe that Brendan Fraser looks old enough to have a son Luke Ford's age. That's arguable (all of the holdover cast is starting to show their age - especially John Hannah) but, again, it's not a deal-breaker.OTOH, the secondary roles are excellent. Michelle Yeoh and Isabella Leong are excellent while Jet Li gives another great performance as the evil emperor. Luke Ford is somewhat bland, though, and doesn't appear to be a good candidate to carry the franchise into the future.The CGI FX are generally excellent but nothing we haven't seen in the first two films. The exception to this are the yetis! With only a few minutes of screen time, they pretty much steal every scene they're in. Where the FX do seem lacking is in imagination, scale, and scope when compared to the previous two films. Perhaps that's because more of the action in the previous films took place in dark, claustrophobic settings, while here many of them are in brightly lit sunlight. The battle scenes in particular suffer in the inevitable comparison to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.Was this film made principally to milk the franchise? Almost certainly, but then so was ""The Mummy Returns"". But that doesn't mean it fails on its own terms. It is entertaining and supplies much of the same appeal as its predecessors. If you can watch it on those terms and if Maria Bello's casting isn't too disappointing to you, then go see it - you may have a good time. I did.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

153,EXodus25X,The death of a great franchise.,4,10 August 2008,"Complete and total let down, this is how you ruin an entertaining franchise. I want to start off with an explanation of my ratting, the only thing that saved this film from a lower ratting was it's special effects. Having seen movies of this horrible quality that also have awful special effects I have to give The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor some respect because of the great special effects through out. Now back to the crap, replacing an actor in a franchise is always a bad idea, if Rachel Weisz didn't want to make another then just write her character out for the third movie and add a new female lead, that way if you make a fourth you still have the option to bring Weisz back then if she is interested. But instead the studio decides to push on without her, now Mario Bello is a great actress but not here, I'd like to hope that it was the terrible script that contributed in a large part to how bad and unconvincing she was as Evelyn. I must admit though I do have much respect for the director's unique way of introducing Maria Bello as the new Evelyn O'Connell, I thought it was a funny and very clever touch, unfortunately that was the last clever thing this film did. The script is awful the one-liners that we had come to expect after the first two films were in no way funny here and came way to often. The story was lame, not to mention once again all in the trailers. Also remember how the films in this series were once both scary and adventurous, what happened to that idea and why is Rick O'Connell now such a complete idiot. I was glad that Jet Li was in statue mummy form most the film because at least then through the magic of special effects they could even make Jet Li express emotions. So all summed up this film was hugely disappointing and over the top corny, I can't even find the words to express how stupid this film was at times.

I don't even know where to start, I didn't see this in the theater, didn't pay to rent it. (I borrowed the DVD from a coworker) and I still felt ripped off. I knew from the first five minutes I was in deep trouble. Rachel Weisz was smart to turn this down, I only wish Fraser had followed suit, then at least the idea may have been scrapped. Maria Bello had all the charm and acting ability of a coat rack. She is a poor excuse for an actress, more or less a replacement Evey. Brandan Fraser looked tired and old. Normally I enjoy him in just about everything, he's got a great sense of humor and likes variety in what he acts in, no matter how cheese-ball it is (he knows it too!). He just looks terrible and puts minimal effort into Rick.Luke Ford, playing the O'Connell's son Alex, looks just about as old as Fraser. I actually sat slack jawed as I was supposed to believe this was their college age son?!!! Who are you kidding! Not only does he look way too old, he's very wooden, generic and boring, even in the action sequences. Jet Li was good. Underutilized but good. It's a shame he had to waste his time and skills in this miserable dreck. The entire first half of the movie reminded me of an Indiana Jones rip off, the whole scene on the ""tomb"" discovery was ripped right from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", and ""The Last Crusade"". My final straw came from the tepid ""chase scene"" through the streets of China with John Hannah yelling about his ""ass being on fire"". I'd like to tell you something more about the movie, but I shut it off shortly after this scene. Roger Ebert (whose insight and reviews I generally respect) had the actual nerve to give this movie 3 stars. Shame on you Ebert! Were we watching the same movie?

155,GLanoue,Series exhaustion claims another victim.,1,20 February 2011,"For all you buffs out there: this is one of those rare films that ends with a threat: yes, mummies have been discovered in Peru. After watching 90 wasted minutes, this is not the hint of a sequel, but a genuine menace of more disasters to come. Everything is wrong with this stinker: just one whiff of non-mummy decomposition given off by this cinematic zombie was enough to send Weisz running as far as her agent could send her. Her role is played by Maria Bello, who is completely charmless and incapable of generating any chemistry with Brendan Fraser, who only looks embarrassed throughout. He also looks way too young to be her husband. Bello also seems to have three or four different accents, not all of them English. Were the director and continuity person asleep? The script is abysmal, starting with Bello's very first comment, a wink to the public that she is a completely different person than the protagonist of her book, so, shazam, we will now not think that the producers were either too cheap to meet Weisz's salary demands or incapable of generating a convincing script. This wretched blundering continues throughout. The script is so bad that Michelle Yeoh's and Jet Li's considerable charms are completely absent, and the less said about Luke Ford as the son twenty years later, the better. He talks like a Frat Boy on the hustle with a hormonally supercharged 16 year old recycled Valley Girl in some suburban basement kegger, yet we are to believe that he is a brilliant archaeologist (and yet (MILD BUT INCONSEQUENTIAL SPOILERS FOLLOW), he wakes up the mummy, which I can't be bothered to explain, and is seductive enough to win the heart of Michelle's two thousand year daughter (sorry; ditto). At some point, Yetis are summoned as a Deus ex machine to save the heroes' hides (again, I can't summon the energy to explain after having my soul crushed and the life force sucked out of me after contact with this dreck), and then, when their powers aren't enough to keep the action moving, our motley crew finds itself magically in a plane in the middle of the Himalayas. What I don't get is why the producers spent their entire budget on CGI when it was obvious that it was the charm of the protagonists that carried the first two instalments of this franchise, especially Vosloo as the mummy, Kevin O'Connor as the weaselly associate and of course Weisz as the love interest that launched a thousand mummies? This humourless disaster just proves that at the heart of film as a visual medium is a solid script, with characters, good and bad, with which we can identify. And here's another no-brainer: a decent script takes one writer, one imagination and one computer three weeks of work, yet it takes three thousand engineers and artists to generate thirty seconds of convincing CGI.

I won't share spoilers from the film itaelf as the story and effects were great as usual. Jet Li makes a fantastic villain. Maria Bello is not and will never be Evy - the quirky warmth, sassy attitude and innocent beauty of Rachel Weisz canmot be encompassed by the toothy Miss Bello whose attempt is stunningly poor at best.

( Which is rich after making that crock the Fountain, which was unwatchable.) But his does have some merits. We get closure on how several characters got older and developed. We get to see some great special effects and it was at least as good as other preposterous Pulp Fantasy genre offerings like Hellboy 2.The really annoying bit was the numerous deleted scenes on the DVD. Why were these bits cut out ? All of them made the movie's plot more logical and some even made better sense of some connecting dialogue. What would have been really great would to have included a Director's Cut version on the DVD with all these scenes back in the right places. Who the hell decided to cut them out in the first place ? Was it just for running time ? It certainly didn't help the narrative.Oh, and Guy Ritchie take note, all the guns were contemporaneous with the period depicted.

After the movie we (three teenagers and I) counted up the actually funny scenes (moments) and we got to four before we ran out. The opening was fine but insulting if you have any knowledge of history, then a scene where Brendan Fraser shoots at trout (1) - then there was a long dearth of anything funny but a flood of really really bad script and performances to match. Then they are on a plane and the pilot says he was too cheap to install safely belts. Brenda Fraser laughs...and then says ""Why am I laughing?"" (2). Then hot on the heels of that one, a cow on the plane gets airsick and barfs into a barf-bag. (3) Then in a chase scene John Hanna's seat pants catch fire. Brendan Fraser says ""Your ass is on fire."" and John Hanna says ""Is my ass on fire?"" (4) Then that was it. The rest of the movie hammered me down in my seat until I was almost sitting on the floor. Hard to really identify what was most wrong with the movie but my vote would go the script and a complete lack of imagination by the director.

161,joben-525-633946,Two Mummy's are enough!,2,24 November 2012,"While the CGI effects and cinematography is undeniably impressive, 'The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor' is woefully short on almost every front, making it a resoundingly dull conclusion to The Mummy trilogy.The plot follows Alex O'Connell (Luke Ford) who gets parents Rick and Evey (Brendan Fraser and Maria Bello) embroiled in a battle between followers of the deceased Emperor (Jet Li). This is after Alex unwittingly steals 'The Eye of Shangri-La' diamond - a diamond which has the power to resurrect the evil Emperor from beyond the grave. Should the Emperor's forces gain this diamond, it could spell disaster on the world. As you may have predicted by just scanning over the above, the story is abysmal and incredibly ridiculous. An even greater problem for director Rob Cohen is the cast he has assembled is shockingly amateurish and the fact they are all professionals in their profession is rather difficult to believe. Maria Bello is appallingly below bar in comparison to predecessor Rachel Weisz who delivered a fine performance as Fraser's on screen wife in the two previous movies. Only Jet Li is respectable in this acting shambles!The brief highlights to 'The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor' are in its expensive budget. This means the movie entails some exhilarating scenes in short spurts, particularly the O'Connell's pursuit of the Emperor.

162,bastiaan0740,This movie IS a mummy alright,3,6 October 2008,"I really liked the first mummy movie. It successfully rekindled a lost concept, the mummy movies. And it was nice to see it all with a 1990's budget and special effects. I felt the first mummy took on too much: comedy, action, history, adventure, horror, love story... probably to reach the biggest possible audience. It compromised the concept somewhat. But overall it was a great movie. And as with all sequels, a new pitch was needed. This is mainly offered with the Chinese theme. Nice try. Unfortunately, it doesn't really work. It just doesn't 'feel' right. In this movie, we get Mario Bello as the new heroine. The replacement of Rachel Weisz didn't bother me too much, I never specifically liked her anyways. Nor did Bello's acting bother me as much as it did the other reviewers. Luke Ford's age difference didn't bother me too much either, I just accepted it all as a given and prepared to enjoy the movie. Sadly, I didn't. Some things are seriously wrong with this movie. Amazingly, I started to dislike Branden Fraser from the start. He keeps barking on with a low-pitch testosterone voice from the get go. Jet Li acts well within his role, but his qualities are seriously underused. The interaction between Fraser and Ford as a father - rebel son is seriously annoying. And Ford's love interest theme is just a joke, especially compared with Fraser's and Vosloo's ones in the previous installments. I guess they just had to add one here. The acting and action are quite good, the special effects are mostly OK, but the script is rubbish. There is no build-up, just a series of action scenes pasted together, with some awful jokes mixed in-between to ruin it further. Instead of an army of scarabs in the first Egyptian mummy, we now get an army of friendly and intelligent yeti's; which didn't quite work for me. This movie is polished by the high budget, but has an unfocused feel about it and ends up a thorough disappointment.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
163,anifanmc,May have possibly ruined my childhood memories,4,2 September 2008,"It pains me to give this movie such low ratings but frankly it was trash. I disliked most of it and by most of it, I mean nearly all of it. This film was an utter turd in comparison to the first two films, which I absolutely loved.The plot is amazingly, predictably simple in comparison to the first two films. It didn't help that it was spelled out word for word in the previews by the damn movie announcer guy who they use for every bad upcoming movie. But I digress from... wait, no I don't. The plot is every bit as bad as I thought it would be. Alex O'Connell, the annoying kid from the last movie, wakes up the Dragon Emperor Shi Huang'di, the famed builder of the Great Wall, and of course his parents are tasked with helping him kill the guy. John Hannah returns as Jonathan, Evy's annoying brother, in trying to kill the resurrected mummy. What is his ultimate plan?Try to take over the world while allied with crazy Chinese nationalists. Gee, didn't see that coming. Of course, this is all pre-Mao, since we can't offend the sensibilities of the Chinese gov't.The movie has two big, big reasons it fails beyond the horrid plot. First, the dialogue. It felt like it was written by a B movie writer (read: George Lucas) and then slapped together with glue. Lines like ""you guys are like mummy magnets!"" were featured prominently in the previews. What, is the base audience now four year olds? In a movie which features mild sensuality and some pretty bloody and violent scenes, I'd say this film is the least suited for children as it could get. Others in my hall of fame include ""welcome to the twenty-first century!"" which was, alas, also put in the previews. How the world do they expect us to swallow this tripe? And then the awkward scenes with Alex and Lin were just brutal to the senses. They were far from romantic and intimate, they felt worse than forced.Which leads into my second point. Maria Bello is a terrible actress who does not do justice to the role of Evy O'Connell. Rachel Weisz was in a class of her own and was not only funny and smart but incredibly talented. Maria Bello is none of those. She's trite and has a terrible English accent, horribly forced and agony on the ears compared to Weisz's nearly flawless accent. It really doesn't help that it's compounded with poorly written dialogue. Brendan Frasier looked as uncomfortable as ever with her, he clearly was not pleased by the fact that she was replacing a seasoned actress he was used to working with. There was no spark between the two and anything they said was forced and poorly delivered.Not only does this movie do an injustice to the series, it is a gross injustice to the very, very good actors in the movie. The few shining moments in the film involved Jet Li as the titular emperor. Not only could he act supremely evil in a role which he generally is not suited to, he busted out some very potent martial arts. The times he was in the film, I was pleased. The reason Imhotep was such a powerful enemy in the last two films was because he was so solidly developed in both backstory and character. Jet Li's character has about, three seconds total dedicated to development. Simple solution? Make the damned movie longer and have some more solid dialogue dedicated to it. In fact, bring back Oded Fehr, Ardeth Bay the Med'jai was amazing as a character. He should have been in China for whatever reason. It would have made me very happy.Also.... at one point, Frasier said to Bello that it was the worst situation they'd been in... no, the worst situation you've been in is agreeing to star in a movie with huge potential that succumbed to second-rate writing. I dared to call a turd a turd this time.... I hope others take some solace in the fact that they'll hopefully not see another.If they do... god help us all.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

Since the main characters are white - I think this is a solid white power film, just as if the characters in most Chinese movies succeeding over others despite all odds is a ""Chinese power"" film.
The characters do not have any depth.

Jet Li is also mostly wasted in the role. That said, the story moves along at a rapid clip, the Yeti's are a cool addition (pun intended). There is some romance and plenty of action... and therein lies the biggest problem of all. It seems that since the second Bourne movie, several directors are crazy for hand-held, let's-see-if-we-can-spot-nose-hairs-or-minute-blemishes on the actors. This dizzy approach to film-making sets true artists of the cinema back nearly a hundred years. There is no panoramic scope to this asinine type of photography. It's so close to the actors that the audience can't tell if it's a fight scene or if the camera man is trying to evade an angry wasp. I curse the pretentious, idiot critics who pan this type of ridiculous camera work instead of telling the truth. It sucks! Also, we had a loud popping during the action scenes and I hope it was a faulty speaker. It's terribly annoying otherwise.

167,piksplanet,"naaaahhhhhh, but i'd still watch another one..",6,10 September 2008,"The Mummy : Tomb of the Dragon Emperor arrives in theatres right at the end of Hollywood's 2008 Summer Blockbuster Season. The film is directed by Rob Cohen better known for making XXX, Dragonheart and The Fast and the Furious. Stephen Sommers who directed the previous two Mummy films, produces this one.The good thing about the film is that it brings back Brendan Frasier in the lead, as Rick O'Connell. If you have seen the first two films, you will know why it is so crucial that he plays the lead role. He is the landmark in a Mummy film when it comes to comedy, timing, expressions, everything. Rachel Weisz makes way for the flat, but funny and expressive Maria Bello. John Hannah as Jonathan is once again a treat to watch. We have a new mummy. An Asian mummy - Jet Li plays Emperor Han, with style! He singlehandedly leads through the film. There's just something about Jet Li that makes me pay attention to his every move. Whether it was The One or Cradle to the Grave or Fearless, Jet Li is amazing. That being said, Tomb of the Dragon Emperor lacks the urgency that the first two Mummy films had. The special effects are not as good as the previous ones. The cast additions, namely Michelle Yeoh, never really impress. The one hour and 45 minute film doesn't seem that long, solely because it fails to get you involved. The narrative is a huge let-down.However, given the fact that it is a Mummy film, it is fairly enjoyable, although the first one is the best of the series, then the second and now this. They leave us with the promise of a fourth installment, which I will most definitely watch because anything to do with mummies is fun! Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is B-grade stuff, and the makers probably knew that when they made it. It is harmless fun, with a lot of bad jokes at the wrong time.

171,DevastationBob-3,Tomb of the Mummy Franchise,2,25 May 2009,"I'm back Mummy movies, Mummy Returns hurt me in ways I'd never been hurt before, but I had to face my demons. For some reason I wanted to see Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. Maybe it was that lingering hope that the first movie instilled in me, like the hope that a cheating ex won't cheat on you again THIS time on the third takeback. Maybe I just wanted to see if any film could top the Mummy Returns in sheer cinematic excressiveness (that's a word i made up that combined excrement and excessiveness). And the short answer is no, but the long answer will be the bulk of my review. The Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is pretty much just a regular bad movie. Rachel Weiz didn't come back (she has a career to think of) and Brendan Fraser did (he doesn't). Replacing Rachel as Evie is Maria Bello. She speaks clearly and with good diction and thus is considered to be English. I'm pretty sure Evie was just a librarian, but now she and Rick are in a stately manor with a butler and everything. Apparently Evie didn't love Egypt enough to not sell off some of their national treasures to fund this. As expected, characterization is being ignored. Bello's Evie is pretty much just Rick with an English accent because since Terminator 2, action movie girls HAVE to kick butt. They can't just be the brains or anything, yes reincarnated Egypt-fu aside, I prefer Evie's character from the first movie. Proving genetics true, two personality inhibited action heroes will have a child who is much the same. Thus, Alex O'Connell emerges as a slightly smaller Brendan Fraser choking the screen with mediocrity and boredom, HURRAY! John Hannah is back as Evie's brother Jonathan, and some comedic relief would surely make the less actiony scenes bearable, but he's really not given that much to do. Speaking of the actiony scenes, they're pretty standard. You've got a little bad wire-fu, some cgi Kitten Men (I think they're Yeti's with an anachronistic knowledge of pro-football), and a villain who's more menacing as a CGI construct than as a living person. Jet Li, fine martial artist, but he's no Olivier. And he really doesn't do that much head-kicking anyway. The story, if you want to call it that, is pretty much ""There's another Mummy and we have to stop it."" Not that i'm expecting the Usual Suspects or anything, but come one, try harder than THAT. So, report card Acting-Bland, Action-Meh, Story- Huh minus. On the other hand, there were no rocket balloons.

Even after seeing the forbidden kingdom i think this is a low point for jet li. It contained a few funny lines like ""no way you two are like mummy magnets."" and ""yah put down the same mummy, twice."" but not much else. the acting was atrocious. brendan fraser was a horrible O'connell in this one.

173,blackasp98,Seems so sad,3,31 July 2008,"I have not seen the movie yet, but i would like to in accordance with tradition sequels. Yet not having Rachel Weiss was a very bad move indeed. From the reviews i have read about their character son being too old i must agree that it is not balanced enough. Having a son too old in the picture is by far a drop out money gainer. This script was not thought out enough, by the looks of Brendan Frasier he hasn't aged a day really, but seeing the fully grown son throws it off base by a mile, but it would have been more plausible having a pre teen take the role making the scene more believable. To me Stephen sommers did a great job of the first two mummy's it would have been much more of an adventure if he did the third installment. But since another director took the reigns, it seems to me that the films creators were under pressure to get it made as soon as possible, cutting corners to fit the script to the screen. This is bad movie making in full force, and not having RW there was a blow to everyone who made or watched the first two films. With her she gave Evelyn the charisma and bravery and funny hip jokes which made her lovable on the big screen. It was a bad blow to my nieces when they found out that their favorite female hero was not there to help Brendan face more mummy's or evil sorcerers from two thousand years ago. If it could be possible, it would be nice to have Stephen sommers consider making a new film with the original cast, a kind of full throttle movie with more spills and chills and roller coaster rides that we are used to seeing from the legendary sommer team.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
174,fatemaster2003,Pretty Good Movie,8,19 August 2008,"Just got out from the theater and watched this movie. Feeling satisfied but yet, there is a little something that felt wrong at the same time.Well, I have to say, this movie still got it's magic on it. The words ""mummy"" definitely has it's own vibe.The storyline start pretty much the same as usual, where an emperor who wants to have everything in the world for him, and felt that life itself is too short to have it all. And so, begin the stories of the mummy: tomb of the dragon emperor.And for the casting, I have to say that this time, the producer made 2 biggest mistake ever. And that is, by replacing the actress Rachel Weisz with Maria Bello, and put up Luke Ford as Alex. Because to my opinion (I'm sure, every people who have watched the previous two, will feel that something is a little bit ""off"" with the replacement of the main actor and actress), Maria Bello's acting has no charm to it (somehow felt dense) compared to Rachel Weisz, and Luke Ford is too old to be the son of Rick O'Connell.But still, it's worth watching. The action, the CG and the special effect, plus the charming Rick O'Connell's action (mix up with comedy), made it a good movie. And don't forget the other main actors in here. Yup, that's the main enemy, Jet Lee and the witch, Michelle Yeoh. The only minus here, is the replacement of Rachel Weisz and the actor Luke Ford who is acting as Rick's son. That's all.So all in all, I want to say, watch it. Even if you are not happy with the replacement of Rachel Weisz, watch it. If you felt that China is not very suitable to be turned into a mummy case, then watch it just for fun. Remember, movies are just for fun, especially this kind of movie. This is not a history or documented movie. It's just a movie filled with fun and all wild imagination from a human being.I rate it 8/10.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
175,DashTheGreat,Horrendous by all accounts.,2,26 January 2009,"What a disastrous piece of feces this movie was. You know a movie is horrific when the original actress who starred in the first two refused to do it after reading the script. First of all, the entire plot was stupid. I was hoping that this movie would at least be entertaining, but every acting performance in this movie was horrific.The fact that Brendan Fraisers's son suddenly picked up a Brooklyn-type accent has to be one of the most laughable things I've ever seen. His cliché, overused, annoying character just served to make me hate this movie even more. For every time I looked for a good part of this movie, I was busting my gut at how over the top and cheesy it was. The son also knows karate, and fights off a ninja? Lmao! Are you kidding me? If she chopped his head off, it would have at least redeemed this movie a little.Now, for the most insultingly horrific part of this bomb - the Yetis. When Brendan Fraiser uttered the words ""Abominable snowmen!?"" I started busting my gut at how horrible this piece of crap was. It was completely out of nowhere, and the definition of pulling a contrived savior out of ones' ass. Even funnier was when the horribly CGI'd yetis were carrying Fraiser off of the mountain. Horrible. Just horrible.Come to think of it, this movie had 20% Mummy action, and 80% boring crap that isn't worth watching. If you're thinking of watching this boring, cliché, over the top piece of dung, avoid it by all costs.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
176,Xex-Arachnid,meh,6,2 August 2008,"Well my son liked it and that's saying something as in ""mission accomplished"" since it was seen only as a treat for him.I never really cared for the first Mummy or the Mummy Returns but when comparing this one against the two previous films, I must say that this one fails.I'm not trying to down this film as much as I seem to be doing after all I did give it 6 out of 10. Well I don't know if this movie is trying to be at a level with the latest (and last?) Indie flick; with the adventurer(s) at a later age, and dominant, ass kicking would be tomb-raiding hero having problems with his adult son, but it sure seems like it at times.I don't care too much for Rachel We-what ever her name is either but her presence is surely missing in this one.To put it short, the only thing that saved the movie for me (a couple of times) is Jonathan but that's it.I thought the Yeti's showing up was cool but a blue eyed, friendly, muscular shape Yeti?-come on.My personal take on this movie and movies like this in general is that I ask what is the sense of the bad guy having supernatural powers only to die a rather natural death and on that note, if Jet-Li's character (which was flawless which is saying something considering I don't care much for Jet-Li either) eventually becomes immortal, then he shouldn't be able to die; an obscure and painful form of banishment yes, but death-no.

177,Nyx_Selene,Disappointing,4,16 August 2008,"I like the two first Mummy-movies, as well as Brendan Fraser, John Hannah and Jet Li, but I can't say much good about this film.The idea involving the terracotta soldiers is very interesting, but sadly, it is poorly executed. The entire production seems tired, the attempts at jokes fall flat to the ground and the dialog is awful. The movie introduces YET ANOTHER crazy pilot, as if two weren't enough, the characters of Evelyn and Alex O'Connell are horribly overacted by Maria Bello and Luke Ford, there is no chemistry between Brendan Fraser and Maria Bello what so ever and not even any kind of sibling chemistry between aforementioned Bello and John Hannah. I wish that Rachel Weisz would have re-prised her role as Evy, but I understand why she didn't.Fraser, Hannah, Michelle Yeoh and Jet Li are good, but honestly, only Jet Li makes the movie worth watching. He is great as a villain and looks like he was born to wear ancient, royal armor.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
178,FromBookstoFilm,Not bad could have been better!,5,2 August 2008,"The Mummy:Tomb of the Dragon Emperor though not as good as the Mummy 1 and 2 I enjoyed it more than the prequel The Scorpion King. The story I thought wasn't bad. The script could have been better. The special effects were decent. I really enjoyed the Yetis (Asia's equivalent to Bigfoot) and the Himalayas Shangri La immortality issue (Shangri La immortality concept was actually based on centenarian plus inhabitants of the Himalayas,Georgian peoples of the Caucasus and the Hunza People of West Pakistan.). Once again the story has an ancient love triangle. The first and second films we have midlife crisis Pharoah Seti,his twenty something treacherous unwilling mistress Ancksunamun and her virile handsome high priest lover Imhotep who is Seti's ""supposed trusted friend"". This film has the sorceress Michelle Yeoh who is two timing the Dragon Emperor with the Commander of his armies Russell Wong. Second thing in common with the first two films the Dragon Emperor and Imhotep are both placed under curses. I'm glad John Hannah was back in the series. This movie could have been worse if the screenplay writer decided write the Medjai leader played by the gorgeous Oded Fehr into this film. Nothing against Oded Fehr he was wonderful in the Mummy 1 and 2. With the writing of this screenplay I really wouldn't have been surprised if they had added Oded Fehr luckily the screenwriter did not. For lovers of the Mummy genre this film was better than some of the 1950's and 1960's Aztec Maya mummy movies from Mexico which were ripoffs of the Universal and Hammer Egyptian Mummy movie series. All they did was change Kharis and Ananka and Imhotep and Anckesenamon to some Aztec priest and princess/priestess. Forbidden love.Priestess dies in human sacrifice ritual (in Egyptian mummies princess dies of illness or like Ancksunamun suicide).Priest is buried alive for sacrilege for having loved a princess or priestess (Aztec and Maya Movie) and trying to save her from sacrifice. Egyptian mummy movies the High priests Kharis and Imhotep try to raise their beloveds with Tana Leaves embalming (1940 to 1945 universal films)fluid,Scroll of Thoth (1932 and 1959 Mummy)and Egyptian Magic Books (1999 and 2001 movies)and the Mummies love interests in all the films are reincarnated and the Mummy faithful to his one true love does admire the beauty of other women. He carried off other women in enough films (usually at the command of a lusty lecherous High Priest)before he is reunited with his one true love. I did enjoy this movie and I hope that the Mummy movies will travel to the Western Hemisphere for some action. Mexico or Guatemala would be perfect. O'Connell Junior goes on archaeological dig in Aztec or Mayan ruins falls in love with beautiful girl of Mestizan(Central American Indian and Spanish)descent with nightmares of a horrible past life and through hypnosis finds out that she is the reincarnation of Aztec or Mayan princess or priestess who had her beating heart torn out by Priests and lover was drugged and buried alive as punishment for trying to stop the sacrifice and is to guard the temple or pyramid from desecraters till the end of time. Peru and the Andes would be a great setting to. Lots of mummies of all ages and walks of life in Peru and the Andes mountains. I'm glad I subscribe to archaeological magazines and groups. I would love to see at least two more Mummy films with Fraser and company and Central and South America would be the perfect locations. Universal had four Kharis the Mummy movies The Mummy's Hand,The Mummy's Tomb,The Mummy's Ghost and the Mummy's Curse. All solid movies. This current crop of mummy films could go for at least two more films and then call it quits. So this film got some bad reviews if this series continues and takes the story to Mexico and they recreate the Aztec or Maya civilization (example Mel Gibson's Apocalypto Maya city scenes) and use the ancient Mayan or Aztec (Nahuatl)language as was done with Coptic language in the millennium Egyptian mummy movies. Universal could have box office appeal once again and also popularity with the Hispanic populations who are descendants of these past cultures.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

180,filmbuff20,Welcome to a world where The Mummy Returns is a masterpiece...,3,16 August 2008,"If someone were to have asked me about this film prior to my having seen it this evening, I would have replied that director Rob Cohen may not be the greatest in Hollywood, but is pretty reliable for entertainment value. See The Fast and the Furious, xXx and Stealth for example. Fun, action packed, nothing more. My one major mistake in that logic is forgetting that the director's last foray into the world of fantasy was the woefully abysmal Dragonheart. Needless to say, I now advise anyone to avoid all Rob Cohen films with the word ""dragon"" in the title at all costs. We begin with the obligatory Mummy prologue which as it happens is as good as it gets. It pumps the juices and readies you for a thrill ride that never comes. We learn that an evil Emperor (Jet Li) was encased in molten rock back in ye olde China by a sorceress who plans to leave him there for all eternity. Then we flash forward to London 1946, in which we find retired adventurers Evie and Rick O'Connell increasingly desperate to get out there for more action, while their son sets about predictably unearthing the aforementioned Emperor over in China. In a twist of contrived fate, Jonathan, Evie's brother (once again played as irritating toff by John Hannah) happens to have a night club in Shanghai, prompting everyone to meet up for a spot of Mummy reviving. Chaos ensues and Jet Li spins around quite a bit, while not being the least bit intimidating.Maria Bello, so wonderful in such films as The Cooler, A History of Violence, and even Coyote Ugly, puts in the worst performance of her career, turning even the most cringeworthy portions of the script into excruciating torture, her nasal Brit accent like nails on a blackboard. Dick Van Dyke beware, she's trying to nick your throne. The rest of the cast struggle with a screenplay that must have been produced by a 'type genre here' kind of script generating software. Only Brendan Fraser comes out mildly unscathed, while his director blows things up around him as messily as possible, chucking in everything from crappy CGI yetis, flawed fantasy logic and some poorly judged humour. I'll be happy never to have to hear John Hannah yelling for Brendan Fraser to spank his arse ever again, while the Yak incident hits rock bottom so hard that it's a wonder anyone on set wasn't hit by the flying shrapnel. The soundtrack blares over the pointless one liners, pillaging from both the previous scores, saying nothing new or memorable, and while the sound may be hard to make out, Cohen's Bourne-infected camera tries very hard to make each set piece harder and harder to see. These films are inspired by Indiana Jones and 40's serials, and part of their charm is their style of old school cinematography, so the jerky MTV camera here is jarring to say the least.While the film may have it's small moments, overall it's a waste of time and talent. The change of setting is not enough to give this franchise anything particularly new, since it continues to follow the same beats of it's predecessors religiously every step of the way. The first two movies may have had their short comings, but both were still highly entertaining Jones rip-offs and quite obviously a labour of love for their creator Steven Sommers. This is just another blockbuster off the factory line for Universal, in no way a challenge for the disappointing but infinitely more enjoyable Indy IV. My advice? Go and see The Dark Knight again.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
181,amalank,I liked it,9,18 August 2008,Many people hated this blockbuster but I actually found this latest installment to the Mummy franchise much to my satisfaction The storyline was OK. It is different from the first two movies but this was a better idea rather than being in Egypt again and using the same mummy or type of mummy otherwise it would have been a bit of a put off and a repeat of the previous movies. I really enjoyed the action sequences. The best I've seen in a summer blockbuster this year. The CGI was pretty impressive. And then there is the comedy. The Mummy films had very good humour and the new installment is no exception. I will admit that there are one or two silly moments which did displease me.Overall I thought this was an enjoyable blockbuster.,The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
182,on_the_can,Weisz and Sommers are missed!,6,3 August 2008,"I'll admit I went into this film with a handful of skepticism, I'm a huge fan of the first two films but couldn't help but feel uneasy about the replacement of the franchise's original director and co-star, non the less however the trailers looked to promise a good dose of action adventure and fun and I couldn't call myself a fan if I didn't give it a chance.It's been about 13 years since Rick and Evie had their last adventure, putting down Imhotep for good and killing the Scorpion king at the same time. The two of them are now retired, Rick fills his days with hobbies that don't quite satisfy his craving for action and Evie's been writing about their adventures with the undead, but now with no more experiences left to tell of, she's stumped with writer's block and finding herself in the same funk as her husband. All this changes though when their son Alex (now in his early twenties) uncovers the remains of China's Dragon Emperor, a ruthless dictator who was turned to stone way back when. Rick and Evie are invited to China to help deliver an artifact for MI6 and while there, the Dragon Emperor is reawakened and they're back in action.Once the Dragon Emperor receives his wake up call we are pulled into an adventure that I dare anybody to find unentertaining. It's funny, it's exciting, it's imaginative...and just has a lot of really cool stuff. The problem though lies in the opening twenty minutes. We're forced to believe that Brendan Fraser is the father of a twenty-three year old, only seven years has passed since the last one but they want us to believe it's been thirteen and that's pretty hard to swallow. In the name of entertainment you might be able to look beyond that if not for all the emphasis on their retirement and boredom in their lives. If you do the math it's possible for Rick and Evie to be in their forties and still have their adult son, but if that's the case why are they moping around, depressed they don't have any excitement left when they're clearly in good enough shape to be raiding tombs like the good old days. This, for me anyway, was a major black eye for the movie, the adventure that ultimately ensues would be so much more meaningful if you could care about the characters and their situation, if only their situation wasn't so damn hard to buy into. This isn't helped at all by Maria Bello's attempt to replace Rachel Weisz as Evie. Bello is a good actress but she is nothing like Rachel Weisz or the character she brought to life on the previous two adventures. She puts on a fake English accent that to me doesn't really work and seems to be trying too hard to hold an English heir that Evie never really had. Not to mention the obvious problem of her face resembling nothing of Weisz. That may seem superficial but lets be honest. Maria Bello's not hard to look at but how can you take her relationship with Brendan/Rick seriously when she's not the one he fell in love with in the first film.As for the director, Rob Cohen does an admirable job here. The guy hasn't always been handed the best scripts but he knows his way around action and can deliver some pretty impressive money shots. Unfortunately though as a fan of the first two superior films you can't help but ask yourself what Stephen Sommers would have done. There are also some very convenient plot devices and inconsistencies that the franchise's original creator likely would have worked around better. For one, Alex had a distinct British accent when he was 8, now he sounds like he's from the states, this could be justifiable, but at least hint at an explanation.So like I said, the movie is a lot of fun, and is genuinely entertaining. I'll watch it again for sure, but without Rachel and Stephen I think this franchise would have been better laid to rest.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
183,predator_silver77,Third Time Isn't the Charm! WOW!,2,16 December 2008,"The Plot: The 3rd installment in the Mummy franchise, after battling mummies from Egypt, the main star ""Rick O'Connell"" (Brendan Fraser) is back. Now in this insane adventure of a Emperor of the past who was dominating the land. Then was cursed by a woman who he was trying to make his, Cursing him to a frozen state of mind (Rock). Then Rick's son unleashes this Emperor from his banished curse, and you can pretty much guess what happens! My Spiel: First of let me say this is a horrible movie. Yes, you heard right, I am a fan of Jet Li who made an appearance in this movie, but that couldn't help this abomination. This movie was obviously going for the special effects. Which this movie succeeded in that category. I only really liked two things about this thing, the effects as I mentioned above, and the actress Isabella Leong, who was the love interest to Rick's son. I have grown to ignore ridicules crap in movies, but this movie just had to much crap that I couldn't believe was happening! To many one liners shooting out of Rick and his son's mouth. I knew I wouldn't like this movie I wasn't a fan of the second one. with the ridicules monkey's and the retarded scorpion king at the end! End Result: Well if you are a fan of the Mummy 2 and it's insanity and can learn to live with anything that makes absolutely no sense.

184,Rob_P,A cracking adventure!,10,26 December 2010,"This is a movie to be enjoyed and not analysed.In the truest tradition of the ""boys' own"" adventure stories that were popular in the early half of the twentieth century, this is a rip-roaring roller-coaster ride of your life.The movies starts with a short back story similar to the first movie. We learn of a ruthless emperor who crosses the witch who can grant him immortality and he finds himself cursed, along with his army, to be first burned and then entombed in terracotta for all time. Such is his ruthlessness, guardians watch over his tomb so that he may never be awoken from the curse and released upon the world.But Rick and Evelyn's son, Alex, has discovered the tomb and, unaware of the consequences, he hopes his discovery will put Tutankhamun in the shadow. But he has underestimated his colleague who has been corrupted by modern-day General Yang, sworn to resurrect the evil emperor.Set in 1946, we discover that Rick and Evelyn have not been idle since their last adventure. They are respected members of the espionage community and carried out missions during the Second World War. Now they are entrusted to return a national treasure to the Chinese people.This treasure is the only way for the emperor to find Shangri-La and be reborn to rise up again.So you have the back story.What follows are chases, battles, explosions, death defying stunts, a little bit of love thrown in for the girls, corny one-liners and a great big bag of characters with bigger than life personalities and plenty of good-old fashioned gumption.The CGI is excellent yet it does not overshadow the plot or the characters.I will admit to one, tiny annoyance and that was the three characters who turned up at the tower to help them fight Yang's forces. Please indulge me when I say that it was the only bit that stretched the imagination(!) - I know, I know.Sit back and enjoy 111 minutes of good old fashioned adventure yarn. This isn't Shakespeare but it's very entertaining and I watched it right to the end. I couldn't tear myself away!",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
185,Dream_seeker,I'm really sorry guys I tried to let my mind go with this move but......here my review!,3,3 August 2008,"After seeing Iron-man my first thought was that this is going to be the start to great summer movies...then i saw Indiana Jones and even though i was anticipated to see it, i was shot down by very poorly scripted story, and bad directions that could of made that movie an instant classic...but then, ""The Dark knight"" re leaved my doubts and yet much like anyone who loved the first and second, ""Mummy"" movies saw the trailer for, ""The mummy 3 and thought...this movie is going to be the S**t. Well i got a chance to see Mummy 3 and I'm sorry i went into that theater with a mindless wonder and even still....this movie failed to capture me like the others...but for those that read my reviews i will give you the benefits of this movie before i set off with the negative so are you ready here we go: The mummy 3 started off pretty strong (but i have to be honest it felt like the director was trying to recreate the original but in a Asian stand point) continues the saga of the O'Connell's as they face a mid-life crisis...basically the courageous Rick O'Connell (Brandon Frasier) is now a failed fisherman trying to deal not being in his ""action junkie"" fix and Evie O'Connell (Maria Bello....NOT Rachel Wietz!)has a writers block after writing the mummy and mummy returns (Yes it seems as the first two adventures were nothing more than stories from the mind of Evie...how DUMB is that!?) but yet as she put it, ""it was a completely different person""...haha in a sarcastic way! So in a nutshell the son Alex O'Connell (Luke Ford....NOT Freddie Boath!) is out in china on a dig which due to some cohesion by the curator uncovers the tomb of the dragon emperor...oooooooh! and from there this much becomes a rush amalgamated mess of different cliché's from different movies like, ""Big trouble in little china"", ""Crouching tiger"", and the original ""Mummy"" movie only except replace Ardet bey (Oded fehr) the guardian of the tomb of Imotep with Lin (Isabella Leong) the guardian of the tomb of the dragon king....duh duh duuuuuh!What ensues after this is got to be on record as the most rushed display of story, character development, and a typical display of romance than I have ever seen in a movie and I've seen A LOT of movies. I'm sorry i was trying to put positive to a pretty bad story...well, the soundtrack was good...and the action was very ummm abundant?? But that's what I mostly saw; it didn't pack that close-quarter danger and intensity as Imotep and the original mummy series, i mean after looking at this movie i thought, ""The scorpion king"" was a great movie and i don't like the scorpion king that much! When you have a director like Rob Cohen (Fast and furious, XxX, Electra and other pretty cheesy movies) who for some reason thought CHINA out of oh I don't know....Africa, SOUTH America....Hell EASTER ISLAND was the best place to make a mummy movie, Writers from, ""Smallville"" who ruined the plot, never really gave any depth to the characters and pushed a seamlessly typically rushed (sorry, i mean forced) East meets west romance, Replace a good actress like Rachel Weitz (The reason she turned it down was because she was a mother first and she didn't want to travel to china knowing that she has to take care of her kids...just to let you know!)with a person, Maria Bello who was trying her Damn-est with a bad English accent and attempt...replace a kid for someone who could of been written into the story as Rick's younger brother instead of son, have CGI of Terra cotta soldiers that look like marionette with Big weird looking baby faces and have a climatic fight seen that can be best described by one reviewer as, ""Crouching tiger on the Nile"" and pretty much like a cheesy video game and the end result is a action filled mess that failed to capture my senses like the original. The movie lasted for nearly an hour and a half, and already i felt bad for Brandon cause it really looked like he was trying his hardest to make it work; Jonathan (John Hannah) was making his wise cracks and it did hit its mark but only just a tad. Jet Li was pretty cool but i felt that his powers wasn't used to the fullest....you see unlike its predecessors where Imotep used the sand and water to its full potential, Jet Li didn't. And the fact he only had very short screen-time didn't help the status of the movie either. I felt this movie should of been straight to DVD and it probably would of still made strong sales and hold more clout but it didn't and this movie became a hype that is failing badly. But that's my opinion as a reviewer...you have to see this movie for yourself and give your point of view but i tried to let my mind go for this film i REALLY wanted to like it...but i'm sorry with a typical east meets west storyline it feel flat fast. 3/10 for very strong beginning but fell short FAST. A forced set of character development and a very pushy romantic set up; movie started and ended way too quickly and didn't have the strength and eeriness as the original mummy....and having a son that's old enough to be your brother didn't help much. And i've mentioned this in my other review...i'm getting really tired of the typical white guy saves and fall in love with Asian female set up...its getting really tired, REALLY fast. Thanks Rob for screwing up another good franchise now go back and make Fast and the furious 4: The final frontier.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
186,fred-kolb,"Nothing special, but good entertainment and action",7,10 August 2008,"After having seen ""The Dark Knight"", a movie that has every chance of becoming a classic, I was pretty skeptical going into an action movie, that would probably depend on its special effects, rather than its story. Well, it was pretty much like I expected, but I was entertained and enjoyed myself during most part of the movie.I really like Brendan Fraser. He will probably never win an Oscar, but he's very sympathetic and humorous, and I usually enjoy the movies he's in, including this one. He manages to make the audience smile and laugh quite a bunch of times and he's fit to carry a movie by himself.This is definitely not Jet Li's best role, but not the worst either and he has some pretty good fighting scenes. Michelle Yeoh always seems to be surrounded with a mysterious aura, no matter what role she plays. Maria Bello, Luke Ford and most of the cast does quite well, but this is not an acting movie,and there are other things much more important.The special effects are great and I'm always surprised, how far technology has advanced over the past years. As for the dialogue, well, I guess it's always the same with those kind of movies.. it doesn't really make much sense, but somehow it's good enough not to be totally ridiculous.Something that always disturbs me is that there always seems to be a solution to every problem, and if there's none, the writers just come up with some far-fetched idea of mythical monsters or mysterious places.All in all, The Mummy III, is not the best movie of the year, but makes a good impression on a big screen and you will most certainly enjoy yourself, if you can live with some logical flaws.7.5/10",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
187,crazychap,"Not the Best Mummy film, but still enjoyable nevertheless",6,2 August 2008,"It has been a decade since the events of part II, and seven years since the release of that film. Imhotep and friends are now permanently embalmed, but a new kind of mummy is in its stead, not in Africa or the Middle East, but in China, the other ""EAST"". The year is 1947, and the O'Conells have retired from mummy adventures and wartime espionage. Evelyn has released two-best selling books based on her real-life adventures (named after the previous two movies), while Ricky O'Conell tries unsuccessfully to make a living out of fly-fishing. Alex (played by Australian actor Luke Ford) is now an adult and has dropped out of school to follow the footsteps of his parents by discovering the long-lost army of Han, the Dragon Emperor. With backing from his old professor, Roger Wilson, he achieves this goal, but suddenly receives an uninvited guest in the form of a mysterious woman named Lin (Isabella Leong). Meanwhile, the older O'Connells come out of retirement to send a diamond known as the Eye of Shangri-La back to China as a gesture to maintain solid British-Chinese relations. In Shanghai, they reunite with Jonathan, who owns Imhotep, a posh nightclub named after the antagonist of the previous two films. After arriving to the museum in which Alex has moved the Dragon Emperor to, Roger Wilson double-crosses them and, with the aid of General Yang and his second-in command Choi, they bring back to life the Dragon Emperor and a new Mummy returns to claim his share of glory in the modern world.First of all, this movie is NOT as bad as the cynics might say. I've seen films that are a lot worse than this one, and the movie's 114 mins are not wasted time in any way. Let's start with the movie's strengths: First of all, the film's assets are the special effects, which are breath-taking, and so are the highly-imaginative action sequences (especially the Shanghai chase scene). The jokes, although cornier than the previous films, still make you laugh and Maria Bello makes an acceptable replacement to Rachel Weisz, who played Evelyn in the first and second Mummy movies. Jet Li's character is an adequate substitute for Imhotep and it's nice to seem fight hand-to-hand combat in the finale.Now comes the weaknesses: the movie suffers from a number of credibility issues. First of all, Alex O'Connor seems to have aged dramatically while his parents have not, especially his father. It is awkward to see Brendan Fraser's character, who has not even aged a wink from the previous films, be the father of this young man. To me, Rick O'Connell looks more like an older brother than a father to Alex. Maria Bello is satisfying here, but Rachel Weisz had more edge. Also, I don't think this movie is trying to rehash the story of the previous films, but rather it's trying too hard to stand out from its predecessors. Lin, Alex's love interest, is an interesting newcomer to the clan, but the screenplay hinders much of that character's potential.The movie is not a bad one, but it is not that great either. It is definitely flawed, but not to the point that makes it a pain to watch. As a summer actioner, you'll never be bored as it has enough mummies, laughs, car chases, and special effects to make your money's worth and makes it stand out from your typical big-budget flick. If you're stressed out, bored, or just want to see another movie after seeing the Dark Knight many times (such as myself) then this movie is for you, and you won't regret spending 114 minutes of our time watching it.

I'm really beginning to wonder who is publishing this stuff and why. Quick money is the first answer that comes to mind. Can't say for sure though.Special effects seem to be the focus here, as in so many recent films of the new millennium. Plot, story and scripting are in the backseat at all times. This is truly a sad phenomena, because we should be getting better at these things as time goes on. Unfortunately only the opposite seems prevalent. It's disappointing too, especially when acclaimed film critics like Roger Ebert endorse a project like this one and carelessly throw out tag lines like ""Best of The Series."" I can only say that I feel like I just flushed my money down the toilet. It's no wonder that stores won't take back films and such once they've been opened. They would surely be overwhelmed with returns.When Rachel Weiz avoided this project, that's when everyone else should've gotten the clue to leave it alone and forget it. As bad as it was, the lack of her presence only took the film down to the final level, as her stand in did nothing to hold a candle.In my opinion, and contrary to old Ebert, this was the worst film in the series.

Rachel Weisz smartly declined to reprise her role as Eve and instead we get Maria Bello who shares none of the charm and intelligence of the character. The romance between the immortal chick and the son of O-Connells doesn't work at all, it's stale and bland. There isn't much to be said about the originals but that they're a good time, but this one manages to be somehow worse, when it's not really hard to please The Mummy fans.

Having read some of the reviews on here first i was put off a little about going to watch it but i went and i have to say that i really enjoyed it. Yes its not as great as the first two, mainly because Maria Bello wasn't that great at taking on the role of Evelyn (i do prefer Rachel Weisz) but it wasn't as bad as people are making out. I don't think she got quite into the character but she did an OK job. I was so glad that John Hannah was back because i think that his performances in all 3 make them, his character is so funny and i think he was far the best actor in the third film. The story was the usual but it works and i liked it, the cinema was quite full and there were lots of laughs and i got the feeling that everyone enjoyed the film. I really cant understand why people are slating this film so much, if you are a fan of the first two films you will be sure to like this one. A good 7/10, well worth a watch.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
191,evilresident097,I'm a Mummy fan and even I was disappointed!!,4,16 December 2008,"I'm a fan of Stephen Sommers' Mummy series. I really loved the first one, and The Mummy Returns was pretty good as well. But Dragon Emperor totally ruined the series.On the good side, the effects were awesome, as usual. And the action, though limited was pretty enjoyable. I liked the fight at the end between Brendan Fraser and Jet Li.But the acting is horrible!!! Fraser spits out stupid one liners like ""I really hate mummies!!!"" It was so horrible it was funny. But I didn't come to see a comedy. Maria Bello tried her best to catch the accent of Rachel Weisz for the role of Evelyn, but it ended up useless. And even though Jet Li is what, the title character, he's just CGI for a majority of the film.If only Sommers decided to direct again instead of Rob Cohen, who brought the stinker known as Stealth, then this would be at least a somewhat good entry. But now I say it's time to close this tomb for at least a good while.4/10",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
192,michael-turner13,Look Mummy,5,10 August 2008,"When I went into the cinema I did not have very high hopes. I was expecting a two or a three out of ten film, boy was I surprised.The level of acting is above that of the first two films and so is the storyline. But these are far from perfect The action scenes are what really stand out about this film. In my opinion they really help define the film.The soundtrack was for the most part good but like the rest of the movie far from perfect.Overall not the greatest film ever made but better than the first two instalments.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
193,shushens,Why did Stephen Sommers attach his name to this abysmal project?,1,12 November 2008,"Abysmal. In one word. Lots of stuff happening. All are out of place. Maria Bello is good for a lot of roles. I loved most her performances. A History of Violence, Coyote Ugly, Jane Austen Book Club, Butterfly on a Wheel, etc. etc. But an actor should always know the ceiling of his/her capability. There are a few things Maria Bello is not; exotic, dream-rendering, charming in epic proportions to name a few. And Jet Li/Michelle Yeoh? That completely/absolutely/superlatively ruined what charm was still left in The Mummy project.Stephen Sommers must have gone hysteric. Otherwise he would not let his name appear anywhere in the credits. If you want to see some cheap Kung Fu movie, see this one instead. Otherwise, take a walk.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
194,owlglass,What is the matter with these people?,9,31 January 2009,"Why does everybody seem to hate this flick? No need to rehash what's in it; that's in other reviews. But, seriously, what's the beef? As for me I thought it was good fun, the plot was pretty much what it used to be (and why would we expect or want anything else?), the characters were sympathetic and made me at least care what happened to them. I enjoyed it and I'm going to get the DVD when it comes out.It took place in China, so maybe that's a turnoff for some. It didn't have Rachel Weisz, and that might put off a lot of people; though I thought Maria Bello was cool, without being Rachel, which is as it should have been. The kid wasn't a kid anymore, which maybe people just can't handle.Still I ask: what's the (real) problem?? I just don't get it. The script certainly wasn't any worse than what had gone before. The Mummy got more character-impact and was considerably nastier than the hapless Imhoptep. There was, if anything, more 'character' element than in the previous ones; and it was better done, too.Anyway I'm giving it 9/10, that rating being one in relation to the other 'Mummy' movies, rather than an 'absolute' one.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
195,darlybrito,Not as good as the previous two,6,19 November 2008,"I was very excited about the movie. I thought the first two mummy films were great and entertaining. Before watching The Mummy 3, I thought it looked bigger and better than the previous two. After walking out of the theater, I completely change my opinion. I was disappointed with the story, acting, and action. Yes, the action.Rick O'Connell (Bredan Fraser) is back to fight off a resurrected mummy named Emperor Han (Jet Li). Rick is joined by his son Alex (Luke Ford), wife Evelyn (Maria Bello) and Jonathan (John Hannah). They travel all the way to China and the frigid Himalayas in order to stop the mummy from conquering the world. But in order to complete his mission, Emperor Han awakes a massive 10,000 warriors (Terracota army) to finished the job once and for all. The O'Connells are up against an unstoppable army and an evil Emperor that will do anything to get the job done.The story was very interesting, but the script was not. I thought they should had focus more on the mummy than Alex's life. I felt like Jet Li didn't have enough screen time or even just the mummy. Another thing that I felt a bit disappointed was the beginning of the movie. I liked how they were introducing Emperor Han and how everything started, but it felt like a documentary after a while.I had mix reactions about the performance in the movie. I didn't have any problem with Fraser's performance. He fits his character and he was great in The Mummy and The Mummy Returns. Maria Bello was not as good as I thought she would be. She did okay, but the accent was kind of weird at times though.The action and special effects was probably the best thing in the movie. The action sequences were very good, but I thought they could have been better though. I wanted to see longer battles. Like a longer version of Jet Li fighting Michelle Yeoh and Brendan Fraser at the end of the movie. I thought Jet Li should off had a big fight with Fraser. It was suppose to be an epic one-on-one fight, but it fell short. The special effects were good and believable. I didn't have no major problem with the effects what so ever.The Mummy 3 was a fun movie to watch, but the film has it's flaws. If the the script was better, then I would have given the movie higher rating. While I'm not that interested for the next movie, I am curious to see how it turns out.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
196,sklose32,"Great entertainment. Over the top action, good humor",9,15 August 2008,"As a fan of the first two installments I was happy to hear that a 3rd one was gonna hit theaters. Then I checked IMDb and saw that it only got a rating of 5.4/10. Still, as a fan of the first two I went into the movie with high expectations. And oh boy, I wasn't disappointed. The plot in short: O'Connells son digs up the remains of an ancient evil emperor. Who, if brought back to life, will bring havoc to all mankind. So after a few twists he enlists the help of his father (Brandan Fraser and his wife) who are both retired by now but happily come back for one last mission. It's hard to describe the movie because it's one thrill after another. You go from a chase on the streets of china to a battle in the mountains and then to an really epic battle in the desert. What can I say, the movie is really, really entertaining, it contains a lot of great humor and also features special effects which are rivaled by no other movie I have ever seen.So despite some bad reviews this movie is definitely worth seeing. It delivers fun for the whole family. Don't let yourself be bothered by some fan boys who gave this movie a bad review. Go out and watch it and decide for yourself. If you liked the first two you will love this one.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
197,bmcdannell,From a 50+ perspective: Thumbs (sadly) down,3,2 August 2008,"Since we saw Mummy III and Hellboy II as a drive-in double bill we're doing sort of a twofer - reviewing both movies simultaneously and posting under both titles - because we discovered that we were actually watching the same movie twice. It was a fascinating way to see these films; giving us the opportunity to directly compare and contrast them and analyze why one succeeded and the other failed.Synopsis: Ancient Relic must be returned to Undead Villain so that Villain might be reanimated in order to summon his Demon Army and destroy the World. Hero's task is to thwart this process. In the course of attempting to prevent Armageddon, Hero is nearly killed but is saved at the last minute by Love. Hero's power is not great enough to stop Villain, so secondary characters must make the Ultimate Sacrifice in order to dispatch Villain and Save the World. The End. If it all sounds familiar it's because it's also the plot of nearly every superhero or fantasy movie made over the last umpteen years. Note to Hollywood: It's time to come up with a new plot line, OK? Please? We were expecting to enjoy Mummy III. First, there was Brendan Fraser and most of the cast of the previous Mummy films. Then there was the rich potential of the setting - the Terra Cotta Warriors, the mystery and lore of China...even a trip to Shangri-La and Yetis. The table was set for a feast of mystery, wonder and enchantment. How could they not produce an entertaining film out of all this? One word: Writing. We're always amazed when megabuck films apparently cap the writing budget at a buck ninety-seven. Early on, didn't anyone involved in this say, ""Hey, the script we're working from really stinks!""? The rich mythology available to them was utterly wasted by the writers. Shangri-La was a cheesy set that served only as a platform for one of the progressive plot elements. The Yeti, though well done, performed their little shtick and left the scene. One appearance by the shape-shifting villain as a three-headed dragon and so much for the fascinating potential of Chinese dragon lore. The hero's skeletal army could have offered another little tribute to Ray Harryhausen (as was done so well in the first Mummy), but no, why bother? And the dialogue was uniformly clumsy, blunt and contributed nothing to either character development or plot movement.The writers in Mummy III were obviously in video game mode. Video games need progressive plot tasks. So the Relic is returned to the Villain. But wait - now the Villain must carry a jewel to the mountains that will reveal the location of Shangri-La. But wait - now the Villain must enter the waters of Shangri-La to be fully restored. But wait - now the Villain must return to his tomb and summon his Terra Cotta Army. But wait - now the Army must make it over the Great Wall in order to achieve immortality. And so it goes. Played out like the levels of a video game, and with even less explanation of the rationale than you'd get in a video game. These are game levels rather than story elements, and since the audience's need to be informed isn't fulfilled, it winds up not understanding - and consequently not caring about - what's going on.In Hellboy II director/writer del Toro had the more difficult task. Without a wealth of Chinese mythology to squander, he had to invent his own...but he does it so very well (to see what we mean, watch Pan's Labyrinth - please!). Del Toro is an imaginative story teller and myth maker and proves it in Hellboy II. He also appreciates something the writers of Mummy III don't - the wonder of small magic. The single moment in Mummy III that made my wife ""Ooooh!"" was the transformation of the egg-thing that awakened the emperor. Beautifully done - but the only thing of its kind in the movie. Everything else was bigger than life, overblown. In contrast, del Toro is full of small magic. From tooth fairies to troll markets to wheels within wheels, he understands that an audience can be just as enchanted by the small wonder as by the huge spectacle. It's the difference between stage and close-up magic. Make an airliner disappear and I will only wonder about the mechanics of how you did it. Make a coin float in mid-air before my eyes and I will be mystified.A hallmark of both the Mummy and the Hellboy franchises is the effective use of humor. Mummy fell flat at every attempt. thanks to inept writing. Hellboy pulled it off very well - two love stricken, clueless guys getting plastered to Barry Manilow's ""Can't Smile Without You"" was delightful. We also have to mention del Toro's mastery of lighting, set design and mood. His movies are consistently visually evocative, which makes a good movie even better.The movies shared one flaw with several other recent movies: climactic action scenes that go into visual and auditory overload, causing the eyes to glaze over and reducing the ability to comprehend what's going on. When we lose the ability to take in what you're showing us this is a bad thing. Please don't toss everything at us at once just because you can - let us absorb your work so we can fully appreciate it. Had the intense action not drenched us a few times in Hellboy II it would have another star.In summary, both movies had capable casts and premises with wonderful potential. Mummy III failed, sadly, to capitalize while Hellboy II succeeded very well. The difference was the quality of the writing and the talent of the directing. We only wish the Mummy III crew could take a mulligan, sit down and take a few lessons from del Toro and try again. It's a shame that can't happen.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
198,Lily-32,Worth at least one viewing at a cheap price.,6,23 December 2008,I had a hard time swallowing the new Alex's believability at first but it and the script got less annoying as it went along. It didn't live up to the first one but I didn't totally hate it so I'll call it a win. I had a harder time accepting the new Evie than I did the new Alex (though his lack of accent bugged me). By the end of the movie I was satisfied that it was worth the dollar rental (though I actually got it for free) and I didn't feel like I'd wasted all my time but I won't be adding it to my movie collection. Mostly on account of the fact that I just got rid of the first two for personal reason and to have the third by itself would be silly. ;),The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

I know it's pretty bad now, but when i was younger and my taste in cinema was very underdeveloped, I loved this flick. Honestly, I still don't begin to understand why it's so hated, I mean it's really not that bad. There's fun action, some cool effects, and Brandon Fraser is always fun to watch as Rick. There's also some very cheesy, but funny dialog that I always liked. This flick is the pure definition of a guilty pleasure for me - h*ll, I even own the blu-ray. Anyways, I can't exactly recommend The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, but if you like a fun, campy, adventure movie, I might say check this one out.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

201,Jadamwood,Almost kiddish. A joke.,3,7 April 2013,"This movie, unlike the first two, was a joke. Lacking an actual mummy story and going for a mild history lesson gone bad, this movie disappointed me and I found better entertainment playing a game on my phone during the parts where there was absolutely no entertaining action, humor, or MUMMIES whatsoever. For an action adventure comedy, this movie lacked all of the above and had cheesy humor during most battle sequences for what seems like the children. Without Rachel Weisz as Evelyn in this movie was a bad choice and I can almost tell Fraser was disappointed with her acting performance and it seems like he did it to refresh his bank account. To me, overall this movie was a dud.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
202,dianefhlbsch,Quit While You're Ahead,3,11 March 2012,"Evie and Rick are trying ""retirement"" from their adventurous archaeological work, with a mixed bag of results, as their son Alex tries to forge ahead with his own career.The premise of the movie was rather interesting, and it seemed like a fun idea to see the characters a decade later. Unfortunately, too much was changed in the process of filming. The first mistake is that it is not Rachel Weisz playing Evie – and she IS Evie. This is an entirely different character, without that passion for Egyptology and research as well as the ditsiness that made her so lovable. The wonderful chemistry between Rachel Weisz and Brendon Fraser does not exist with her replacement. If they are retiring from adventurous exploits, then why wouldn't she be a museum curator or lecturing on her field of study instead of writing romance novels? Since when would she be able to read ancient Chinese – she's an EGYPTOLOGIST. And where did the whole spy thing come from? Evie's brother Jonathan is finally doing something successfully. But there were a ridiculous amount of stupid lines that were supposed to be comedy. And why the Scottish accent? (I know the actor is Scottish, but the character is not!) We are also introduced to new supporting characters to get the job done. Unfortunately, they don't resonate with the charm and appeal that Bennie and Izzy did.We are reintroduced to Alex, but instead of that quick and precocious young scholar we met and loved in ""The Mummy Returns"", we meet an annoying, arrogant, cocky, somewhat whiney young man – not someone you really want to care about. The latest historical dig introduces us to a strong and touching new subplot with wonderful characters, but not until AFTER the dig. The subplot is great and actually is what makes the movie worth viewing. Someone needs to remind the director that action and special effects are supposed to ENHANCE the story, not BE the story. In short, the main plot and characters should have been thrown away, and a new movie should have been made from the subplot alone, with a completely new title, and more focus on the story.Watch it for the great subplot and great performances from those characters. But if you are looking for that ""Mummy Magic"", don't look here.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

204,ariwriter,"Mindless entertainment, nothing more",5,30 July 2008,"A friend invited me to an advance screening last night and I was hesitant at best. I'd only seen a trailer and read minimal previews of the film as a means of walking in with a fresh pair of eyes.My friend and I were each disappointed. He hoped for more Jet Li action and I hoped for more kick-butt mummy battles.After a longer-than-usual introduction setting the background, we meet the O'Connell family, 50% of whom are played by new actors. James Bond and Batman are believable with new actors, but Evelyn and Alex O'Connell are not. To me, anyway. If you haven't seen the earlier films in the trilogy (which you don't need to see to understand this new plot), you wouldn't blink.In favor of the film, I enjoyed the cinematography, costumes, set direction, and stunning visual effects. But acting? As another reviewer wrote here, ""Meh!"" But I enjoyed it, despite few one-line comedic gags that ruled the earlier films.

205,brokensilent,Sadly disappointed,4,6 August 2008,"Well, loving the first two, I went into this with high expectations. Perhaps a bit too high but nonetheless, this movie didn't even strike close. Maria Bello just could not take the place of Rachel Weisz. Her acting was sadly flat and it was difficult to care for her character anymore. She took a super cute, spunky Evie and turned her into just another woman. The storyline was as transparent as they come, anyone who didn't see the plot twist regarding Alex's love interest wasn't paying very much attention. All I could think as I watched the film was that they made this movie simply to cash in on the martial arts craze that is going on right now and failed miserably to create either an entertaining martial arts movie or an adventure film. The computer graphics were too much. Rather than being entertained, I found myself rolling my eyes, especially at the end of the movie when they finally lay the emperor to rest. I loved the first one, liked the second one, and didn't care about this last one. There were a few funny moments but they were so eclipsed by the eye rolling and yawns that I found it's one of those films not worth seeing in the theater. Hopefully they stop at this one but since this came across as one of those films purely made to cash in on the success of the original, I doubt they'll be able to help themselves.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

I went to see The Dragon Emperor fully expecting the worst based on critical assessment but nonetheless intrigued by Ebert's good review. I understand what Roger was driving at: the picture is very sound in that it doesn't pretend to be anything more than it actually and exactly is. No attempt at messages or Deeper Things or pseudo symbolism attempted by some film maker trying to mix popcorn and deep thought. So by its very lack of pretension and naked embrace of bangboom it is good. Put aside big expectations and you'll come out of the theater OK with this film.

Other than that Imhotep will not be included in this film, instead you get Jet Li playing as the new mummy, some things of this film are going to be annoying but there were some upsides to this movie. This film does contain good humor and does make you laugh, not as much as the first 2 but something is something. It'll have action and it will be entertaining, so don't worry, and the obvious expectations for a fight between Jet and Brendan in the film, won't say how it'll turn up but at least it happens. This film is OK, but only as like a once a month thing, it's a good family picture, if you expect this film to be as good as the original films then you will be disappointed, but other than that this movie isn't that much of a waste of time, it's an entertaining way to spend time with family and a have a few laughs.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

The special effects are outstanding and the fantastic creatures are interesting to watch and look real even on a big screen.Where this movie does not succeed is the scripting. The story progresses in the most uninteresting and predictable way, people think and act like puppets on strings. The worst parts are the scenes when there is no action - you may need to pinch yourself not to fall asleep.The introduction of Maria Bello as a substitute for Rachel Weisz's character can hardly be called a success: she lacks the youth and passion required for this role. Luke Ford (playing the son Alex O'Connell), is believable, but he looks just as old as his father on screen!

211,Vergilya,Mummy dearest not,7,12 August 2008,"Before I saw this movie I heard and read so many bad reviews about it I wondered why I should watch it in the first place. Being a die-hard movie goer who doesn't rely on ratings I went anyway. After watching it I realized there were a few elements which the Mummy fans were looking for that weren't there that made them curse the movie much more than a mummy can.First of all there was no Rachel Weisz. Secondly Michele Yeoh and Jet Li stole the movie much more than Brandon Fraser could help save the day. Thirdly, there was more emotion, though not developed very well, than just the usual mindless drivel and madness. In a way, it was kind of like a cool Kung Fu movie with English speaking actors. Other than those flaws I enjoyed it nevertheless.Jet Li's powerful characterization need no analysis. Brandon Fraser being Brandon Fraser still has his leftover days of Airheads, which he keeps very close to portraying him again and again in his recent films. Michele Yeoh, the Ipoh girl who has rubbed shoulders with the rich and famous and traveled the world over is always that cool Asian chick who knows Kung Fu. Even in Sunshine, without the Kung Fu, she's still the cool Asian chick with her head screwed on when everyone else is going berserk. It would be nice to see her playing a role where she is not that cool to make her even cooler.That said, Mummy 3 is in the same vein as The Forbidden Kingdom where Jet Li gets fossilized waiting to wreck havoc.It doesn't have the grandeur of the Egyptian mummy with its mystical charm, lavish costumes and erotic implications but for a kickass (though not as much as before) time with mythical creatures, martial arts extraordinaire and awesome effects The Mummy 3 is all about letting the good times roll.

212,Visitor_C,A Sad Excuse Of A Film,5,31 May 2014,"In the world of franchises, some clusters of films try hard to live up to the expectations of previous films. Other times, the new installments tend to torture the viewer and kill its predecessors. This film is an example of that sort of film. The first issues I had with the film came from the actress change for the character of Evelyn. Don't get me wrong, Maria Bello is a grand actress, I just don't prefer the change, I feel that it takes away from her character, especially after having two films in which she is shown to have an important role in the history Rick is living in. My second issue is the villain. Yes, it is still a mummy, but it has no deeper meaning then just that. In the original films, the mummy had reasons in the way he did things, never intending to take over with an army, but instead to resurrect his dead lover or make himself immortal. The new guy just wants to go to war with everything. Any other issues that I have with this film is just the disappointment in the writing, character development, and non- invigorating plot.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

214,AJ_is_Awesomness,Terrible...,1,20 July 2008,"A true honest review? Some true honest advice? Don't waste your time on this, its terrible. I am a true fan of the original. I like the way it was weaved together with interesting characters, hammy dialogue and breath taking action sequences not to mention a beautiful location and some great plot devices. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weiz lit up the screen with his charisma and her likability factor. They made a good screen presence and carried the story along until its fantastic action packed finale. I also like the way the producers mixed up the scenes, to spoon out not only violent and eerie scenes involving the main villain himself but to water it down to family standards with John Hannah's comical brother. It was a film of epic proportions. A fun story, likable characters and good use of live action and cgi, for the most part. Then about 2 years later Universal ran out of idea's and so decided to return to the bandwagon to churn out another cash cow sequel. 'The Mummy Returns' was released and whilst not as good as the original at least had the decency to be spectacular enough for the risibility. Fraser and Weiz returned (having made an offspring) and warbled, walloped and crashed through the bustling busy streets in a less than original screenplay but at least maintained their charm and kept the spark glowing from the first film. It was a likable sequel, and whilst no where near as good as its ancestor still managed to be entertaining.So here we are folks. 2008 and yet again we are re-visiting a tired series. The next gruesome threesome to bring home to Hollywood is not only the worst of the Mummy films, but quite possibly the worst sequel of the year to date. Its so bad in fact that even Rachel Weiz turned it down, but its not surprising having listened to some of the laughably dire dialogue churned out here. I bet she took one look at the script and threw it in the trash can. The story goes something like this... Brendan Fraser (back as Rick O'Connell) his wife Maria Bello (yes they replaced her with someone with half as much talent) her brother John Hannah (what is he doing in this?)and their son Luke Ford (who has now aged by about 20 years) are somehow prancing around in their ordinary lives (in the Far East?) but suddenly the son awakens an evil Mummy Emperor (because hey thats what your bound to do in a movie like this) who wants to use his army of the undead to take over the world and get revenge on the sorceress who put him to sleep so many years ago. The only people who can stop him are the O'Connels who crash and bang through armies of stone beasts, supernatural winds and all sorts of other unoriginal menaces. Of course the showdown at the end will result in global domination or ultimate Savior. But by that time, you just wont care.So.. why do I hate this one? when when one of the main stars from the original backs down and bails out and when the other looks bored throughout the whole darn thing you know you have a problem on your hands. And its sad because Brendan Fraser makes it blatantly obvious how unhappy he is reprising the role without Weiz by his side. He is never able to connect with Bello who tries to be chirpy but comes off looking rather ridiculous as the smart girl. And there we have another problem. Bello just cannot squeeze into Weiz's cleverly filled shoes. Its embarrassing to watch her warble on and you can really tell she felt uncomfortable trying to live up to the characters standards. The same can be said for Luke Ford, who makes a very unconvincing action hero-sidekick next to Fraser. Again they have no spark or connection what so ever. It feels like a cheap decision casting Ford because he never really brings any emotion, good or bad to the screen. The exception here is Jet Li, who whilst is not as menacing as Arnold Vosloo (the original mummy) still pulls off a good dark role. Its fresh seeing him portraying an evil character and it pays off when he is actually on screen. However his presence is short lived and at times feels like a guest appearance. And of course John Hannah who never disappoints and steals the show altogether with his one liners and witty charm. He almost makes this passable. Almost.The movie deserves another good kick in, this time for its overly used CGI action sequences which feel cheap, tacky and unoriginal. Imagine a Roger Corman flick added into a Uwe Boll video game adaptation and your halfway there. The sets are nice to look at, but the CGI is really distracting and you can tell they did things all by computers. The character development is replaced with an endless array of pointless battle sequences. Pointless !Its also really degrading seeing our much loved characters from the first movies spout lines of almost ridicule. Brendan Fraser cringes as he reads his lines (is he auditioning for the high school play?)and like I said Bello looks uncomfortable. Even Hannah looks bored and whilst trying to rescue this epic failure always looks like he wants to be doing better things. Like the ironing for example.There is just so much to bash this movie about. Its an obvious cash in, but even fails at being entertaining. It doesn't live up to the first or even the second. It is boring, confusing and the characters are bland. The action is over the top and don't get me started on the screenplay. Its just an all round failure and should be buried in the Tomb of the title, never to be re-awakened.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

216,Goodfellasz,Here we go again,5,18 August 2008,"Here we go again. The mummy was enjoyable, the mummy returns was funny, the mummy 3 is hell. Rob Cohen, not the better director, made the mummy series into a B-film without brains. 1. The Mummy had this special effects, a Egyptian mummy and a great thriller effect. 2. The Mummy returns had this sense of humor. 3.The Mummy 3 had yeti's, a dragon (greec mythology) and a kind of dog.Also the story was crap, it's an indiana jones copy. Indiana jones 4 : indy is a secret agent. The Mummy 3 : O'Connels are secret agents. Indiana jones 3 : eternal life. The Mummy 3 : Eternal life. If you make a film, make it good and original, don't copy another film, if you do that, you might wanna make a remake. The huge army of mummies was just a replay of the second film, the impossible love is a copy of the mummy. All good and well, but a mummy in China??? I have never heard of a archaeological site were they use guns. And the worst thing is the absence of Rachel Weise.

218,squirtsquirt7,"Decent, enjoyable but missing three things: Imhotep, Ardeth Bay, and the real Evie",6,7 January 2009,"I saw this for the first time a few nights ago and I have to say I enjoyed it. The first two were way better, and this one was fun but it was missing three major players that made the first two movies great. First, Imhotep, now I know if they made another movie with him, it might have been repetitive but I can't really see a great Mummy movie without him. That brings me to Ardeth Bay, the protector of Imhotep's tomb, a fantastic character from the first two movies played exceptionally well by Oded Fehr. He was one of the best characters of the series and he and Rick made an awesome team. The absence of him, really hurt this move. The main problem this movie had was no Rachel Weiz. Maria Bello is a fine actress, I have seen her in a few things, her most notable performance being in ""A History of Violence"" and she's good, but she over-acted in this movie. She was trying to be Rachel Weiz and she most certainly is not. The makers of this movie mad a terrible mistake in not casting Rachel Weiz this time around. All in all, a good movie, with funny dialog and good action. It's an enjoyable adventure but if you're expecting a Mummy movie as good as the first two, you will be disappointed.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
219,movieman430,A smack in the face,1,12 August 2008,"If I got completely hammered one night, drank a little more, then sat down in front of a computer and wrote a script, it might come out something like The Mummy 3. Except it would probably make sense and not suck so horribly. For those of you who remember, the Mummy used to be a legitimate franchise that combined horror, action, and comedy into fairly tight packages. The first movie is rather good. This apple fell far from the tree and then was left out to rot in the hot sun. The movie picks up roughly ten years after the Mummy Returns, although no one has aged but Alex who has dropped out of college and is now running a high profile dig in China. Rick and Evelyn, replaced by the insufferable Maria Bello, are chilling out pretending to be happy. After a plot device or two, Jet Li, an emperor who's curse is either to live forever or to talk like a woman, is raised from the dead. The previous mummy effects were pretty damn good, This claymation Jet Li is laughable, especially when he's taking off layers of his face and throwing them as weapons.But I was along for the ride. I was. I was struggling to deal with Isabella Leong's inability to act in her role as Lin, Alex's love interest. Then, they decided to stroll up to the Himalayas, find an oasis city like they did in Returns, fight off a bunch of bad guys, and get rescued by, wait for it...Yetis. What in the name of god possessed Alfred Gough to put yetis in his script? But good old Al decided yetis weren't gay enough, so at the beginning of the films third act, Jet Li suddenly gains the power to turn into a three headed dragon. Take a moment to soak that up. A three freakin headed dragon. I'm all for going to the movies and having a good time, turn your head off entertainment can be good fun. But Rob Cohen cannot expect us to eat up this crap and not vomit in our popcorn bowls. The Mummy 3 has not one, not two, but zero redeeming qualities about it. It's a four year olds dream movie dressed up with PG-13 gore. This means that it can't really appeal to anyone. At least anyone with half a brain. So, in the end, this movie sucks and if you see it you are as dumb as the people who made it and that is pretty damn dumb.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

I know these are not rocket science flicks but replacing her with someone else was just silly and did not fool anyone! Should have shown your audience more respect than that.The story was too forced. Its as if they had no idea what they wanted to do and improvised the story as the filming went (however, they were bad at it).I am a huge Mummy and Brendan Fraser fan. Yet, this sequel is a totally disaster. It is just horrifying to watch. The story plot and cast are just awful. I cannot understand what's in their minds when they produced this film. In my opinion, it is not worthy to attend this film at all.Title says it all. Don't waste your time or money, if you have to, just wait and rent it.

What's sad is that the director, Rob Cohen decided to get rid of the three things that made the first two movies (Both by Steven Sommers, the guy how made the Men in Black films) popular: Rachel Weisz, Industrial Light and Magic's CG (While not perfect, was 100 times better then what's in this movie) and overall plot. What we get is over the top CG from Digital Domain and Rhythm and Hues (the Former *Who worked on Transformers, Titanic and POTC: At Worlds End* did the Wariors and the latter *From Night at the Museum and Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and the Wordrobe* *My advice, check them all out.* did the rest of the character animation *Which BTW is Sh*t and too bouncy*) that is inconsistent and overall sucks, the Plot sounds like a generic Video Game mixed with the second Mummy film and the acting is worse then both of them combined.If you're looking for good mummy films, check out the first two films, if you're looking for an FX Extraviganza (How's it spelled again?), check out Star Wars, Narnia, Transformers and loads of other films.

228,Flower_of_the_Lily,"Third-time, not quite as lucky...",6,11 August 2008,"I enjoyed ""The Mummy"", written and directed by Stephen Sommers, immensely. It was funny, witty, ludicrous and action-packed. The sequel, the appropriately titled ""The Mummy Returns"" was even more ludicrous and action-filled, although the wit had abated somewhat. But I still enjoyed it. And the third effort...? The ingredients are there - a mummy (of sorts) an ancient curse, ancient love, bad guys, good guys, exotic locations and general all-round silliness. But this film isn't nearly the accomplishment the first film was, nor does it have the sheer brazen showiness of the second. If anything, it's a rather rushed, haphazard mess of a film. The film whizzes along at break-neck speed, so busy trying to cram in spectacle it rushes through the script and allows a great deal in terms of plot and character to fall by the wayside.Which is a pity, because the concept is a promising one. The film commences in Ancient China, detailing how the Dragon Emperor (Jet Li) conquered nearly all of Asia. He was a master sorcerer too, but realising that death will rob him of all his power, he sends his trusted General, Ming, to find a witch who is rumoured to know the secret to eternal life. Ming finds the witch, named Zi Juan (Michelle Yeoh) and it's clearly a case of love at first sight. Unfortunately, when the Emperor sees her, he decides he wants her for himself, ordering that no other man should ever touch her (sound familiar?) Ming and Zi Juan go to find the secret of eternal life, and succeed, but their love overcomes all other scruples. They return, and Zi Juan makes the Emperor immortal ... only for the Emperor to have Ming brutally killed for disobeying his orders about Zi Juan. She in return curses him and his army, and they turn into the Terracotta warriors, standing motionless for eternity.A few thousand years later, in 1946, Alex O'Connell is grown-up, and unbeknownst to his parents is away from college and leading an excavation in China, hoping to find the Terracotta Army. Jonathan Carnahan (John Hannah) is actually running a successful nightclub in Shanghai (called Imhotep's, no less). Rick (Brendan Fraser, the only other actor from the original film) and Evie O'Connell (Maria Bello) have settled down in England, and are slowly dying of boredom whilst their son has all the adventures (and is apparently too busy ever to visit) But a request for help from the Foreign Office sees them heading off to China, and you know it's only a matter of time before the inevitable happens ...I can't fault the acting, to be honest. Fraser does what he does best - fighting, wisecracking and kissing with aplomb. Maria Bello isn't nearly as wide-eyed and ditsy as Rachael Weiz was in the role, but she's likable enough and totally convincing in the action scenes. Michelle Yeoh is good as usual, Jet Li makes a convincing baddie, Luke Ford is far less annoying than the kid in ""The Mummy Returns"" and John Hannah is totally charming as usual - my only regret is we didn't see more of him. The main fault lies in a hurried pace and slightly weak script - the romantic sub-plot between Alex and a warrior named Lin feels tacked on and quite a few characters seem superfluous.But happily, this film has all the madcap charm of its' forebears, and, weak script aside, is actually lots of fun. This isn't quite enough to redeem its flaws, but hey, I've seen worse. If you're ready to be entertained without being overstretched mentally, then take a chance.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
229,steel_arkangel,The most disappointing film of the year,1,9 August 2008,"I should start off by saying that I love the Mummy and the Mummy Returns, but having done some reading before I went in, my expectations weren't high.Many people have commented that one of the reasons it failed was because of Ms Weiz's absence, however my feeling is that it went much deeper than this.Every one of the actors in this movie seemed to struggle to deliver their lines convincingly. Don't get me wrong, the Mummy movies are supposed to be ""hammy"" but this wasn't pork, this was swill!!Even John Hannah, who I have great respect for, just couldn't seem to pull off the character - it was almost like none of them WANTED to do this movie, and just went through the motions.The sad thing is that the story had potential, and the CGI wasn't bad at all.So to sum up, if this is the best we can expect from the sequels, then the Mummy needs to RIP!Jet Li - understand why you didn't say much!",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

But i was still excited to go see it just because i love the feel of the mummy movies. But after about the first 5 minutes it lost me. The mummy movies don't really lend themselves to China. So i didn't find the plot very interesting. Their seemed to be no chemistry between any of the actors. I was especially disappointed in Brendan Fraiser. The abobidble snow man, i mean come on. I just found myself looking at the clock on my phone waiting for it to be over. It just didn't have any flow and it was missing the one thing that made the mummy movies good for me, that mysterious 1920's / Indiana Jones feel.

231,amolghadi,The Dark Knight IS the Big Daddy of all 'Mummies',1,6 August 2008,"Ever since it started in 1999, this 'Mummy' series was not my type of series, fantasy or not. Personally, for me, if you are Actually Enjoying a Mummy movie, that means only two things ; either you have infinite amounts of tolerance or you are simply brain-dead.And yet I forced myself to watch this one movie, even though here in India, our national daily had rated this movie as ...a pitiable 2 / 5. And pleasantly for me this movie is not one bit above as it was judged by our daily. It IS exactly 2 / 5 or even below. My reason to watch ? I was eager to learn whether this movie does have it in itself to dethrone the Best Movie of 2008 till date: The Dark Knight. Thankfully it does not. And thankfully, The Knight in its third weekend slashed the mummy in its opening and rightfully so. The Dark Knight is one of those rare movies ever made that is soaring like the majestic eagle right now and breaking Box Office records at the time of me writing this. And I hope more and more sane people watch more and more of the insane but cunning Joker's Bad Jokes in 'The Dark Knight(2008)' IN THE THEATRES and help it reach it's rightful place : The World-Wide Top 10 movies. ( If a pretty ordinary movie like Spiderman-3 rises as high as Rank 11, 'The Dark Knight' definitely deserves better.) The DVD of Dark Knight will arrive when it has to. Don't wait for it. My appeal to all those crazy young girls and senior citizens (all 60+ men and women), who had never ever in their life before, watched anything that can be technically called a 'movie' BUT still watched 'TITANIC(1997)' and made it so successful : Please watch the intellectually challenging and entertaining 'The Dark Knight(2008)' while it is in theaters, especially in an IMAX one. (OK, I understand... since Titanic, eleven years on, most of those pretty young girls must have metamorphosed into beautiful young moms and most senior citizens must have already booked a place in heavens/ hells, but still...there will still be some of those type of losers present today... including of course, Spiderman-3 / Mummy fans.)....And, uh,....yes, I had completely forgotten that we are in the Mummy's territory and not in the Bat's or in the Atlantic Ocean. So..... would just say that I have nothing much worthy to say about this 'Mummy' movie but since Fact is stranger than Fiction, if you still want to watch something important and breathtaking related to mummies, Tutakhamen is lying in wait for you on the National Geographic Channel and THAT series is really outstanding without any doubt. And since I have watched everything about the Egyptian King and other mummies on the NGC, I could not find anything entertaining / thrilling / chilling in this Hollywood 'Mummy' movie even for fantasy's sake. So I rate that NGC series a 10 out of 10 and this Mummy movie or ALL in this series: 1 out of 10, just on the basis of watching ONE. (If you really want to watch a much better fantasy and adventure series: Watch the 'The Lord of the Rings(2001-2003)' trilogy or Indiana Jones series or the more intellectual and more scientific -'The Matrix(1999-2003)' series or the amazing visually stunning 'Arabian Nights I/II/III(2000)' TV movies) The Best Fantasy Movie that I have ever watched in my life till date is Spielberg's scientifically accurate 'Artificial Intelligence (2001)' - ( 10 out of 10 ) - which has a REAL scientific base to it and definitely is not everybody's cup of tea except those of software engineers (like me). But that is an altogether different issue.Finally, what is to be the top priority is to avoid these pieces of junk called 'Mummies' ( from Hollywood of course, NOT the NGC) and better spend your hard earned money in buying the tickets for TDK because The Dark Knight is ... the Big Daddy of all Hollywood 'Mummies'.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
232,albert-wayne,They should have left this Mummy in the sarcophagus,1,21 August 2008,"This is probably one of the worst films I've seen in my life, and I don't tend to toss around accusations like that lightly, but this third installment of The Mummy series initiated back in 1999 deserves such dishonor, cause it's such a bad example of film making, it borders on offensive.I'm a guy with simple tastes, I'm not one of those people who think cinema begins and ends with Bergman and Goddard, I actually enjoyed the previous Mummy pictures, even the second one, which I know was cheesy as hell, but like film critic Michael Phillips said about cheesy movies, a movie sometimes is just ""10.000 pounds of cheese on a cracker, but sometimes, I'm exactly in the mood for 10.000 pounds of cheese on a cracker."" But The Mummy: Tomb of Dragon Emperor is, at best, feces on a cracker, the cracker being the amazing trailer of Quantum of Solace before the movie, probably the highlight of the experience.I won't go into any details regarding the plot, cause, well, the plot is pretty much explained fully on the trailer. We pick up with the O'Connell's, retired and bored as well, just as I was while watching the movie. They get at again to stop the evil Mummy of the Emperor Han from taking over the world...how original, when will these Mummies just wanna lay back and enjoy the comforts of the modern age. I'd love to see a movie about an ancient Mummy , brought back from the dead, only to be flabbergasted by the technology of the present, and lay around drinking beer, watching TV, and getting fat with McDonald's. That would be more fun that all that this movie had to offer.All of the actors were there for their paychecks, Brendan Fraser has never been more boring. John Hannah was also incredibly stupid, and the jokes they wrote for him were not funny at all, some are even distasteful. Luke Ford, playing Rick's son, not only looks like two minutes younger than him, but less charm than R2-D2, Michelle Yeoh is wasted, Jet Li doesn't have the Mummy gravitas that Arnold Voosloo had, and finally, Maria Bello; filling in for Rachel Weisz, who had the good common sense to stay away from this dregs, she is horrible, she looks so concern with her fake Posh accent, which she got wrong anyhow, so, at the end, we are left with nothing in the acting department.Rob Cohen, man, is he getting worse and worse, when you though Stealth was really the lowest a director could get, he managed to enlighten us with an even lower level of mediocre work. He has never been an interesting director, and his campy style has butchered many movies that looked interesting, if only for entertaining purposes, like Dragonheart and Daylight, but you would expect at least, with all that money spend on these summer movies, to have something to show for. But no, no, no, everything looks poor, the action sequences are dull as hell. To prove my point, this will probably be the only movie where a sword fight with Michelle Yeoh and Jet Li lasts about 20 seconds, and it's all in slow motion. If a director cannot make a sword fight between those two modern icons of martial arts films, he should really think about retiring for good.The story is stock, which is to be expected from a B movie of this sort, but like Raiders of the Lost Ark proved, even B movies can be Oscar Hopefuls, but there was no attempt at all with this one. The pacing of the story is terrible, the special effects are sub par, and at the end, you are left with a 2 hour yawn fest, to which you would fall to sleep within minutes, if it weren't for the loud noises coming from the speakers.The movie is shameful, and not worth the price of the ticket, this movie is the reason why some theaters have money back policies, and had the theater I saw this had one, I would have asked not only for my money back, but for a year of free admissions, for having seen this awful mess.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

Only at the end, during the expected mummy-on-mummy battle, was there significant use of CGI.The yetis were a very clever, original idea.In contrast to the second mummy movie, the plot was simple. I think the writers wanted to get away from over-complicated story lines (although the second mummy movie was good precisely because of interesting and complicated plot lines).My only complaint was that the storyline was too predictable, and some concepts overly borrowed from other movies, such as using a diamond to locate the fountain of immortality.Like all the mummy movies, I like that this movie starts out by showing that all the supernatural powers have a root in some realistic non-supernatural human drama or injustice, in this case, enslavement and burying dead slaves inside a wall.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

I won't say that Ms. Bello can't act, but the bad script in conjunction with Ms. Bello having to try to be Rachel Weisz's Evelyn just did not work. Then there were the horrendous efforts at humor...""the yak yaked""...really? Pathetic.This movie isn't worth watching even once.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
238,Dragonfyre137,Another desperate attempt to make money on a successful brand,4,26 August 2011,"!! Contains a spoiler regarding a prequel !!The Mummy has to be great. The third adventure with Brendan Fraser as Rick O'Connell and Arnold Vosloo as Imhotep. Great plot, plenty of funny scenes and overall very entertaining.Well, that's what I expected before watching that movie... The Plot is totally independent from the first two parts of The Mummy, which on one hand is good because you don't necessarily have to have seen the prequels but seriously: Who would watch a sequel without having seen the prequels? The plot lacks of basically everything that would create some tension or at least keep the viewer more or less interested in the movie and most of the characters (putting O'Connell aside) are flat so you don't really care if they die or whatever.As we all remember, Imhotep died in The Mummy Returns, and so should have the movies. For me it was just another desperate attempt of recycling an old brand. Too bad todays directors lack of any innovation. You don't dig out old Mummies, let them rest in peace.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

This series believe me has lost its charm, and it is dead now, and Mrs Connell should have been dead by now i suppose instead of being part of this movie there is no bonding or romance in the expressions as it is seen in earlier movies, but rather seems like some 5th grade play...When will directors learn SEQUELS DON'T WORK, at least unplanned theme based sequels never do!!! Camera has not much to do when you are shooting a movie using computer graphics but still has proved spoil sport in this movie. Camera man has not caught the eye of the actors in the shots at all....In a movie coming under the umbrella title of The Mummy the viewer expects canny duologue's, some awesome graphics, and a fun filled dialogue with the mummy (some new duologue's) Dialogue like ""I hate mummies"" if you keep hearing it for 4 movies obviously the viewer gets fed up.This movie became more like a dubbed martial art movie than a well directed sequel of the mummy series...Please for Gods sake don't go to the theaters to watch this movie... instead watch it on a DVD when you have nothing to do on some weekday evening.... You at least wont feel valuable time being lost watching it",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
240,somnorosu2002,Big let-down but not horrible.,7,20 August 2008,"I am a big fan of The Mummy and The Mummy returns, and i have to admit this sequel has let me down a lot. However, it does not deserve to be bashed so hard by people that had such high expectations from it.First of all, yes, it is not as funny as it's predecessors, dialogues are not as original, acting is not as great, and yes, Rachel Weisz is no longer in it. In my opinion the absence of Weisz is the biggest thumbs down for the film, since everyone loved her charm and the chemistry between her and Fraser.Still, the film has very nice man vs. so called ""mummy"" (which is actually an statue-like undead Chinese emperor) fights and great special effects, which makes you stay in your seat eagerly biting your nails waiting to see what happens.In conclusion, ""The Mummy 3: Tomb of The Dragon Emperor"" does not have the same charm and originality of the previous ""Mummies"", but how can it, it is already the second sequel, but the fast paced action makes up for the lack of interesting and funny dialogue, and makes this film worth losing 2 hours of your life watching.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

I study film on a daily basis and I have to disagree with some of user comments.Mummy 3 is a great adventure and basically shows how important families really are and no matter how bad things get you still have to stick together. Mr. and Mrs. O'Connell are struggling with good parenting with their son Alex and by the end of the movie everything is shaped up.The Special Effects as usual are amazing! Although the biggest failure of this movie is the Dragon Emperor.

242,rushmoras,"Could have been more entertaining than the second one, if not for",6,24 December 2017,"A couple of things, which bothered me:1) The Dragon Emperor's CGI. Would have been really impossible for the film-makers to just simply constantly make him look like a decaying mummy, instead of being encased in a bronze statue? Because the former was just bad CGI, and the latter would have been a question for a good make-up artist;2) The ability of the Dragon Emperor to shape-shift. Sorry, but those scenes were just quirky. I understand that the film-makers wanted to show the audience ""lo, and behold the might of this villain"", but keep the dragons and stuff to the fairy-tale movies. Not Indiana Jones esque movies;2.1) The same could be said about the Yetis in the movie;3) So, during the end, The Dragon Emperor finally understood English? Another one of his supernatural traits or just an overlook from the guys responsible for the scenario?3.1) The same could be said about the Chinese witch in the end. Do the fallen enemy solders understood English (because there was no English at that time) well enough for them to rise from their graves and avenge themselves against the Emperor?Anyway, would have been looking forward for the fourth Mummy set in Peru (Jonathan's words), but, ah, well, you win some, you loose sum.

244,billybobwashere,Here we go again.,6,17 July 2008,"Surprisingly, ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" isn't as bad as both its marketing and the long period without an installment suggested.Despite a seven-year hiatus and the loss of one of its leads, the 'Mummy' franchise jumps right back into the action without many problems. It's willing to change up the story a bit, giving us a new Mummy character and setting as opposed to one featuring that Egyptian guy from the first two, but it also manages to retain all the things about the earlier films that made them popular - that is, a proper mix of action-adventure and a light-hearted tone.Brendan Fraser is back as Rick O'Connell, the Indiana Jones-inspired hero from the original films, and by this point, he really has his character down. In fact, I think he was much more comfortable here than he was in the original films, maybe because he has improved as an actor over the past seven years, or maybe because he doesn't try to make his character any more than it should be, and it's a refreshing thing to see. Returning to the role of Jonathan Carnahan, Rick's brother-in-law, John Hannah is just as strong a source of humor (and in reality, that's all that his character is supposed to bring to the table) as he was in the past.Which leads us to the big third member of the party: Rick's wife, Evelyn. As you may know, Rachel Weisz was the actor who portrayed her in the old films, but because she was unwilling to make a third film, they had to replace her, something that often has awkward results in movie franchises. However, I must say that Mario Bello truly rose to the occasion, capturing a nearly identical voice to Weisz's, and playing the part like she isn't new to it at all. And when we first see her character, a clever joke about feeling 'like a completely different person' eases the change. There is nothing about this trio that I could find any real faults in, and this helped make the film very enjoyable.Another bonus to waiting seven years in between installments in our digital age brings another advantage to the film: much better special effects and action sequences. And believe me: this film definitely capitalizes on this, as both a chase sequence in China early on in the film (sorta reminiscent of the Shangahi sequence in 'The Temple of Doom') as well as the final battle at the Great Wall blow away any action sequences you saw in the first two movies. So in terms of action, you'll definitely get your fair dose of awesome effects. They definitely put that reported $175 million to good use.Sadly, everything else about this movie doesn't begin to compare to the returning stars and the action sequences (luckily, these two components make up much of the film). The Mummy in this movie is played by Jet Li, who isn't at all as cool as one might hope he'd be (he's basically Jet Li's usual martial arts master, with some occasional superpowers thrown into the mix). The film crafts his story so similarly to the background story in the first 'Mummy' movie that there's even a point where the dialogue overlaps ('Nobody is to touch her'). It was disappointingly obvious that his story existed purely to create conflict for the protagonists and to set up some awesome action moments.But the disappointments don't end there. Joining Rick, Evelyn, and Jonathan on their quest to stop the Mummy are Rick and Evelyn's son, Alex (Luke Ford), and an immortal woman named Lin (Isabella Leong) whose job is to protect the contents of the very tomb that Alex inadvertently helped bring back to life. These two characters form a romance along the way, setting up some great moments for both Fraser and Bello as their son's curious parents. The only problem is that these two lovers are played by some very weak actors, especially Lin. Alex comes across as more of a playboy than an adventurer (which doesn't make sense when characters comment on how much he reminds them of his father), and every time Lin spoke, my friend and I had a bit of trouble holding back the laughs.Another problem the film faces is that some of the time, things just don't make sense. I won't get into details, but there is a scene where Lin calls upon some yeti-esquire creatures to help them fight the Mummy (who conveniently come in handy later on in ways that she couldn't have foretold), Lin speaks of giving away her immortality for Alex's love even though they have known each other for a day or two, and the characters continue to think that simply shooting a mummy with a gun will destroy him, even though past experience has been evidence enough that there's no use.So while on one end we have a film bringing back three very enjoyable characters and upgrading the action sequences to fit modern-day standards, we also have a movie with a boring general plot, weak supporting characters, and a few too many 'WTF' moments. However, this is mindless summer entertainment, and you ultimately have to forgive such problems to an extent, as long as it delivers on the right levels, which this film does. It's much better than 'The Mummy Returns,' and just as enjoyable as the original. Even though there are a lot of things I would have changed, I can't say I was expecting it to turn out as well as it did.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
245,legspinner,Superior 'Disneyfied' Action Flick - but haven't we seen it all before?,5,29 August 2009,"I haven't seen the first two films. The opening to the film sets it up very well indeed: the premise is strong, and the ancient-China lead-in good. The CGI is imaginative. Very imaginative, and only occasionally does it look like CGI. Which is a recommendation. The tricks inside the pyramid are quite imaginative for a while.There is good characterisation of the yeti, nicely unusual. Marvellous swordplay in it, only slightly let down from time to time by that old FAULT of virtually all Hollywood film, what I call the 'shaky camera' syndrome, in which it is believed the only way to get across the urgency and intensity of action is to move cameras so fast you don't get the sense of who is doing what. Face it, most action scenes are incomprehensible in their dynamics these days, because you cannot track the movement of individual elements of the action.NOW THE BAD STUFF Soundtrack - 0/10. This was the first 'alert' for me that what we were watching was tripe. It is insultingly predictable and must have been orchestrated in about five minutes.CHARACTERISATION You just don't care. None of the characters are even remotely likable. Except maybe the Irish pilot, who gets 10/10. The idea of the nightclub-owning uncle is great, except it's overacted. I don't blame John Hannah; the rest of the film fails to live up to his standards. Everybody else is so weak. Brendan Fraser pulls a few faces here and there, and sternly ticks off his son, perhaps, but even that scene is badly badly done. In that situation, Alex o'Connell would have far MORE to say to his parents. This neat, glossy tiff between them is not realistic at all; the film had the chance to break boundaries in the fantasy film world, and to generate some real tension between its 'goodies', but failed.PLOT I defy anyone to be very excited about this. ""Let's take over the world."" ""Oh no one of the good guys is dead. Everything's wrong."" ""No, suddenly everything's all right."" YAWN! A much better direction for the film would have been to explore how Alex had, on his own initiative, been about the blow the professor's treachery when his parents burst in on the scene. As I say, this would have led to considerable tension and a real film to watch.All we are left with, after all of this, is a film with a couple of excellent lines in it, some great CGI, and that is trying to use its soundtrack to excuse its failings. And yet, as 'Disneyfied' adventure films go, this is the best of the bunch. Had it come out in 1985, with 'Goonies' or 'Indiana Jones' or 'Young Sherlock' to contend with, we might have been saying what an excellent advance on the genre it was. I see the Soundtrack won an award. I also see Brendan Fraser won an acting award - or was nominated or something. Wow.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

But director Rob Cohen is unable to create the magic like director Stephen Sommers did in earlier parts. Wrong direction ruined the movie. Only very few scenes can attract your attention.This movie could have been great. But it seems that director was under great impression of Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh, which leads the role of main hero to be suppressed.

Jet Li rescues it as a great villain. The special effects are pretty good, except the Yetis, which look about as realistic as Jermaine Pennant ever scoring for Liverpool again.

OK the first film was a success, they cashed in on that with a sequel, and they should have left it at that. I enjoyed the first movie , the second one less. But this was a joke. Rachel weisz being replaced by Marie Bello was a bad move. But even if Rachel Weisz was in this film, i don't think she could have saved it. Not surprised Rachel turned down the script. I think what made this film a failure was a lack of originality.(There is only so many times you can use the same storyline and with this franchise you cant really change the storyline.) The mummy storyline has now been repeated again in this film(Some idiot opens the tomb, the mummy comes back to life and wants to take over the world, and the good guys stop it and save the day.)

249,Leopold005,The Mummy - The Curse of the Regurgitated Idea,1,27 August 2008,"If anyone ever needs proof of the old adage, ""You can't go back again"", then this film is exactly what you are looking for. That, I'm afraid to say, is about the best thing I can say about it.I'm a big fan of the original ""Mummy"" films. They were smart and sassy, with lots of humour, lots of action and some quality characters. I even enjoyed ""The Scorpion King"", which I always assumed was the third ""Mummy"" film, despite it being a spin-off with none of the clan O'Connell in it. However, everything great about those films has been largely overlooked in this lame effort.For a start, Rachel Weisz isn't playing Eve any more. Not that this should be any great barrier, as long as the casting is done well. Unfortunately, it isn't. Her replacement doesn't really shine in the role at all. Instead of the smart and clumsy Egyptologist who is capable of saving the day, we have a soft, fluffy bunny of a woman who isn't anything like as strong as we recall her. Perhaps time has softened her, but I sincerely doubt it.Then there's the fact that Brendan Fraser really doesn't seem to get into the role either. Gone is all the fire, passion and wisecracking, to be replaced by someone who does none of this. And to boot, he comes off as a disappointed father, yet this would be contrary to his previous character who would no doubt have enjoyed going on missions with his progeny. And there's another thing. How did his son gain 10 years on his old man?The plots in the old films were never their strong point, but in this film it's positively transparent! This is only highlighted by the 15-20 minutes of back-filling on the story of the Emperor (which was actually more interesting than the rest of the film). What's worse is that, the minimal plot there is, seems to be more of a tale about how families can resolve their issues, set in a backdrop of the Chinese undead. Yes, there are some action scenes, but they are very rushed, the effects aren't great, and they don't feel especially satisfying.Jet Li was wasted in this film. John Hannah's character was bordering on pointless. None of the other characters were explored in any great depth. You leave the cinema feeling like you don't really care about any of it. In fact, you almost resent the studio for robbing you of your time and money on it, to the point where you feel justified taking in your own sweets! The only saving grace is that it's not that long.If you've not seen this film yet, save yourself the effort.

With her, this could have been one of the best flicks of the year, along with The Dark Knight, of course. But it was still very good. It's different, in a sort of similar way, to the others. This, I thought, was the funniest and most action packed of the 3, but had something missing. This makes my order 1. The Mummy 2. The Mummy Returns & The Mummy 3 tied. If your looking for a movie that's going to be as good, if not better than the first, you will be disappointed.

251,BlokeWithABrainUK,Woeful instalment of a dying franchise,2,31 January 2009,"Oh dear, oh dear.What were the producers thinking?The first thing that strikes you is the truly preposterous casting. Brendan Fraser is 40 years old, and looks a few years younger. The actor cast as his character's son Alex is 28yrs old, and looks it.So Rick became a daddy aged about 12. Or did he? Because according to the date this film is set (1947), and a reference to the last time he met a minor character (1923), Rick must be in his 50's. But there has been no attempt to ""age"" Fraser at all. Indeed, when he appears alongside his son they might be believable as brothers, but father and son? You have to be kidding.But anyhow, on to the film itself. It suffers from an extremely poor script and an incredibly contrived storyline.So far, so not good.But it gets worse. In a shameless display of plagiarism, all the first three Indiana Jones movies are plundered:1 The nightclub scene and subsequent chase in Shanghai. 2 The characters dragged underneath the chariot. 3 The plane flight into the mountains. 4 The crystal firing a beam of light to show the location of the hidden ""well"". 5 Father is mortally wounded, son has to get him to the well of immortality, and pour the elixir on his wound which miraculously heals. 6 The elixir is guarded by an immortal........and on and on.It is difficult to put my finger on exactly where this kind of movie goes wrong. Somehow Indiana Jones pulls it off without crossing the line into the preposterous. Mummy 3 not only crosses that line, it accelerates off into the distance faster than you can say ""Hang on, John Hannah's character is totally irrelevant.""Which does indeed bring me to poor Mr Hannah. His sole purpose in this debacle appears to be to deliver utterly unfunny one-liners almost directly to camera. His character actually de- evolves in this - a neat trick - to become less than one dimensional.To be fair, the effects are adequate, and the pace is rapid (it is only really 1hr38mins long), but there is a surprising lack of tension throughout. I found myself siding with Jet Li on more than one occasion. The love story sub-plot is truly cringe-worthy - not only does Rick's son appear to be virtually the same age as his father, but whereas Fraser the actor exudes charisma, his son is the complete opposite. Unlikeable and instantly forgettable, his attempts to woo an immortal girlie-ninja are so devoid of any spark that I found myself urging her to do us all a favour and stick her dagger into his chest first.However, she will never age, and so doesn't want to get kissy kissy with him because she would have to watch him grow old and die... ahhhh.But don't turn off just yet, in virtually the next scene her two thousand year old mother, played tiredly by Michelle Yeoh, rescinds her immortality (in order that the opposing warrior army can live) so she can shack up with dull Alex after all. That was handy.And so it goes on. And then it ends.Good.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

The second film had a weaker plot but the same sense of fun, and now... well, the formula seems tired. It was entertaining, but it just lacked the fun edge that the first two films had. Go see it if you want a visual feast, but if you want a film with a good story, forget it. Another snag with the film is that you expect to see more of Jet Li, but there isn't really enough of him in the movie. A film about the Mummy doesn't actually contain enough of him to convey how dangerous or scary the character is. Best bit: Jonathan shouting 'spank my ass!'

Emphasis on the mindless.The writers have, all throughout this franchise, seem bent on just throwing a bunch of hackneyed action and stilted dialogue at the audience with as much weight in the script as a cream puff.They take actual legendary/mythological references, locales and characters and tailor make them to their own goofiness. Take the reference on Shangri-La, for instance. Shangri-la was invented by James Hilton in his pro-Utopian novel, Lost Horizon. Shangri-la grants immortality (or, as the characters in Lost Horizon discern) probably just extremely long life. There's a catch, though: once you leave Shangri-la, you age rapidly and die.The action sequences are all over-the-top, and if you are an impressionable moron who likes bright and shiny things that are always blowing up, you'll like this.I'm a fan of Brendan Frazer, but I think he's due for a better turn this this nonsense.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
254,xletxmexgox,Wow. And not in a good way...,1,16 March 2014,"Alright, so firstly, I do have to be completely honest and say that I haven't even finished this movie yet. I actually paused it, so I could write this review, something I've never done before. But this was so terrible I had to vent it all out.What the heck is this?! It definitely isn't The Mummy. Firstly, whatever reasons Rachel Weisz had for not appearing in this, I'd be willing to guarantee that the largest one was the terrible script. Even with a well done script (which this movie definitely didn't have), throwing a new actress in would have caused waves. But at least having the new actress took some of the heat off of the god-awful script.Which leads to problem number one.I've never heard of the actress they got to play Evelyn. But she should have -and based of this movie, probably will -remain in obscurity. Whatever they paid Ms. Bello was far too much. Even her accent was terrible.Now I do understand, filling Weisz's shoes would be difficult for anyone, and I tried to give Bello the benefit of the doubt. But after ten minutes of her, I was almost ready to chuck the remote through the TV just to get her off of it. Her acting skills were atrocious. I don't know if she was trying to play Evelyn as Weisz would have done, and failing miserably, or if she was really just that terrible of an actress. Honestly, without Weisz, this movie shouldn't have been made. Not because Weisz 'made' the movie, but because we'd had two movies to come to know and love the O'Connell family, and the random insertion of a completely different looking actress to play Evy was probably the worst choice they could have made.Problem number two was Luke Ford. His horrible acting skills aside, the first thing that made me mentally cringe was his accent. He went from (in the Mummy Returns) having an obviously very British accent, and yet in this movie, all of the sudden he's an American (or apparently Canadian, but I digress). Again, you don't just change something like that. Maybe a good actor could have pulled it off. But a good actor, this kid was not. His lines were stiff, and unbelievable at the best of times, and seemed like he was reading directly from the script during his first read through the rest of the time.And my last, and final problem (or at least the final one at only 30 minutes in) was how completely out of character everyone had gotten. Now I haven't seen too much of Jonathon, but Evy and Rick are like two completely different people. Not just in their actions, but even their own words. The characters not only did a complete 180 from the first and second film, but the way they talk doesn't even align with the previous movies. They talk about Evelyn coddling Alex, and Rick ignoring him, which apparently they started doing sometime after the Mummy Returns for some odd reason.Now, I will continue to finish watching the movie. Maybe they'll come up with some magical way to change my opinion, and I'll have to come back and change all this. But somehow I highly doubt it's possible at this point.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

Plus another downfall was that this movie did not have the same actor in it ""Rachel Weisz"" Eve was played by another girl ""Maria Bello"". Which made the movie seem weird. But anyways this movie was still pretty good but it really shouldn't have been a part of the mummy series they should have re-write it to make it fit the original two story lines better.

256,toyguy,Entertaining,8,5 August 2008,"Decided to catch ""Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" this weekend. I think its another one of those films that got panned universally. Some people complained that there were no Mummies, but I guess they don't understand that undecayed corpses of ancient emperors and dignitaries could also have been mummified in well preserved tombs. Mummies don't have to be those bandaged ones from Egypt. And one critic was even complaining about Brandon Fraser's acting!! And also that the new Evie actress had a bad ""American's"" British accent. Really who cares about the acting in a movie like this? None of its predecessors were deep or life-changing. But they were entertaining, and I thought this one was also but with a different twist on the ""Mummy"" character. Maybe its the stereotypical view that us westerners have of Mummies in entertainment. Jett Li's Mummy character is not the traditional kind that appears in 'monster' movies. Anyway, not once has any of the Mummy movies been anything more than just great special FX movies. You bring to life the undead and have Brandon fight them in a happy-go-lucky way. This one's no different. And like in previous 'Mummies' which involved some historical figures in their fictional stories, like Nefertiti; this time the ""Dragon"" Emperor was actually a real historical figure who was the first Emperor of the Qin Dynasty. A powerful if cruel character in history.But what I liked was how they had to venture to various archaeological sites like the Qin's tomb with Terracotta Warriors, or mythical places like Shangri-La to fight against bad guys trying to revive the Emperor. Along the way, it reminded me of how Indy4 should've been like instead of having Jones chase after aliens. This has been a summer of few hits and mostly misses. With X-File which should've featured aliens but show us none, and Indy which should've stuck to archeology but show us aliens instead.Too bad this film got bad press from some people who are entitled to their opinions, of course. But I'd say go out there, see it and form your own opinion. I thoroughly enjoyed the roller-coaster ride.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
257,godin_al,Couldn't get into it,2,5 January 2019,"I loved both the mummy and the mummy returns.
With a historical spin and fantasy infusion, It had just enough quips of humor to keep you entertained while not having too much focus on action scenes and gore which can make a movie less substantial in the story line. But what I also liked in those first 2 was that this historical action fantasy tied in some romance and drama to boot for depth on several fronts. It was a well rounded story for both Mummy and Mummy Returns.
This 3rd one however, despite having an intriguing back in the past intro, the present story is dry even forced perhaps.
The new MrS. O'Connell (Maria Bello) really over did the roll from the original mellow sweet Rachel Weisz turning the character into an over dramatic retiree desperately hanging on to the adventures of the past and trying hard to spark romance between her and her husband in the present.
Even the humor is stretched thin from previous movies, and with the new Mrs. O'Connell, it just didn't seem to flow between Maria Bello and Brendan Fraser. Not to mention bringing in the ""older"" Alex. All in all seemed a bit awkward.Final conclusion: Was very disappointed. Couldn't stay focused, and felt that some of the major characters weren't ones that felt real...taking away from the story and seemed more like those of B rated movies and bad acting with bouts of awkwardness.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
258,HellsBattleMoose,I think curse is the appropriate term here,1,20 December 2008,"Few times in my life have I actually felt embarrassed to watch a movie. I think I kinda know how Brendan Frasier must have felt getting roped into this disaster. The only highlight in this movie is the performance Frasier, Li, Yeoh and John Hannah put in in their best efforts to make this movie look passable. Frasier often looks visually bored delivering dialogue I'm sure he knows is terrible, and the lack of chemistry between him and Maria Bello is very obvious. The absence of Rachel Weisz in this movie is felt from the very beginning and just never stops in a tail spin of bad dialogue, over-used CGI and blatant attempts at stupid laughs. The appearance of Luke Ford as the grown Alex O'Connell will no purpose other then to confuse you as he looks no more then 5 to 10 years younger then Frasier and Bello.Terrible movie people. But, everyone at least tries their best. Too bad the writers didn't.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

260,Lord_of_all_zombies,Less Than Satisfactory...,5,7 August 2008,"I came into this movie knowing it would not be that great. I expected it to fall behind the first two movies, but not as much as it did...Tomb Of The Dragon Emperor lacks almost everything. The action is sub-par, which is strange, considering Jet Li is the main villain (There are too many jump-cuts in the intricate battles involving Jet Li), the dialogue between Brendan Frasier and Maria Bello is gag-worthy, in that there is no visible connection between the two and Maria Bello just looked like she was doing the role just because she was forced to... The comedy ranges from decent, to bad, to just plain bizarre... (Asian Yetis who like American football...? Was the only one who saw that?). Finally, the CGI is just fake. And normally, that can get past me (Yeah, I was convinced with I Am Legend's creatures, sure they looked fake, but they got the job done...) but this was just laughable. I almost imagined the wire-frames of the undead and stone soldiers on the freakin' computer monitor, and don't get me started on the lame mud effects used early on in the movie...I loved the first Mummy movie. Everything about it was just good. Not great, but entertaining and grand enough to make me smile and say ""That was neat!"" And, despite the poor reviews, I found the second one to be just as satisfactory. But Tomb Of The Dragon Emperor made me want to hit Rob Cohen in the head for making what he believed to be a movie with the same magic and wonder that was present in the first two movies...You know, I just realized I've been heavily reminded of X-Men 3... Hmm... Think of it that way, why don't ya?",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

It was nice to see the characters back for one last outing, although I never really got comfortable with Maria Bello playing Evelyn, sorry. She's a fine actress, she's just not Rachel Weisz. The plot is not massively dissimilar to the first two films, with Jet Li taking on the villain role. He's quite menacing at times, but after a certain point (you'll know it if you've seen it), all jeopardy is lost. They should have called it 'Mummy Forever', then we'd be eagerly awaiting the follow up, 'Mummy & Daddy.'",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

What's so special about her?.4) Jonathan was not nearly as funny in this one. That damn script let him down.

263,pauljraab,Total Rubish,1,7 August 2008,"Terrible, terrible film. This movie was poorly written, badly acted and completely unoriginal. I think they even stole music from the Raiders trilogy. Lowest point: Maria Bello was a train-wreck and couldn't even maintain a consistent accent. For that matter, the rest of the family couldn't either. Are we English or Australian? I spent the first third waiting for it to get going, the second third contemplating walking out, and the final third regretting not walking out and falling asleep. The only reason I've written this much is to comply with the minimum content requirement. This film is so bad in every capacity that wasting more time with additional details is salt in an open wound. I didn't think a movie could be worse than Alexander.

264,overcast22,Good Special Effects,6,18 June 2008,"I saw a screening of the movie this week and was not expecting much. I liked the first Mummy a lot, did not like the second Mummy as much. I would say the third Mummy is about as good as the second Mummy. It was an interesting idea to have the movie take place in Asia. The scenery was beautiful and so were the special effects. I wish I could say the same about the acting. Story has not changed much from the previous movies. Mummy rises, Mummy wants to rule world, must stop Mummy. The new wife of Brendan Fraser is not as good of an actress or as hot as the previous actress. Brendan Fraser's son was not that great of an actor either. And i was confused with how old Fraser's son was supposed to be. It looked like his son aged 22 years but Fraser only aged 2 years from the last movie, strange.Overall the movie was okay. If you are looking for a deep story, with great acting,then you chose the wrong movie.If you are looking for something to pass the time and some cool special effects then this is the movie for you.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
265,viofitz,Awesome but Predictable....,6,15 September 2008,"I was expecting this movie last year ago by surfing this site, since I'm loving the Mummy movies specially Jet Li were involved with Brendan Fraser. By the movie them self were actually good in a cgi, action, comedy, & the setting of the Mummy in China. However the story for some reason are predictable precisely resembles to the previous Mummy films, even the plot it's too simple in my opinion & some were ridiculous & doesn't make sense like how the hell the Emperor(Jet Li) became as a horse rider Terracota Mummy. The actor plays good specially the returning Brendan Fraser as Rick & John Hannah as Jonathan(at least they're making this movie became hilarious). My glitch on some characters in this movie is Isabella Leong which is a bit annoying in some scene & her character were too damn boring also I didn't like her end up being with Alex maybe it's just me since I never like Asian gal with white guts but I didn't being a racist, Russell Wong's face as Emperor's general doesn't suit well since he's mixed between western, the main priority is Maria Bello as Evelyn the character of her in this story makes her being an unimportant character compare to her previous movies & the personality were different than the previous one nothing look alike. I bet most people disappointed by Rachel Weisz absence, but even if she's returned I think won't change anything... Luke Ford as Alex seems like Rick's brother compare to Rick's son & he's too old for Alex role the only thing that I like was his voice. The General Yang's girl Jessey Meng as Choi are too ridiculous in her whole scenes, why General Yang left her when escaping with the Emperor & this makes her role are not necessary to be in, but unlike Ancksunamun in The Mummy Returns she's more loyal to General Yang... & Jet Li as the Emperor were decent & I was expecting the battle between Jet Li & Brendan Fraser but it's kinda disappointing since Jet Li seems weakling(dunno what exactly to say in properly since English isn't my language) himself in the end. Lastly they're too much using effects in this movie specially for Jet Li's role as the mummy in terracotta are too overused compare to the previous mummy movies, & makes his role in person were not worthy compare to the premiere arts... However if the previous mummy movies doesn't exist or this movie are not considered as ""The Mummy"" I think this movie were brilliant, might just need to re-write the script I guess... Now let's just hope the next mummy movies won't disappointing again even though I'm not really sure....",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

While this movie does have some moments of genius, where Cohen's directing prowess is truly visible, ultimately it fails. Additionally, once Gough and Millar completed the script they were no longer a part of the creative process, and pressure on Cohen to make the film a pseudo-family movie lead to the downfall of what had been a strong action comedy script. My hope is that Gough and Millar can get behind another TV series, as that is what they excel at. Also, I have no doubt that Cohen will find a more mature project, better suited for his directing style.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
268,emick23,What the Heck? No continuity.,6,3 September 2009,"Alright. I watched this with my wife last night and, every time I see it, I get more angry about the lack of continuity. First, Alex lost his accent; it is now an American English and no trace of the King's English may be found. This DOES NOT happen after a child has already surpassed his formative years of schooling. Alex was a ""tween"" during the Mummy Returns. Further, he aged 15 years? Jonathon suddenly ""lost"" his ability to be a crack shot with a rifle? Come on! Only Rachel Weiz can be Evie as the new actress adds nothing to the character except bewilderment. Evie is suddenly an expert on ancient China? The first movie noted that she spent her entire life in Egypt and was able to decipher ancient hieroglyphs. Okay, the second movie did show her fighting with a pair of sai, but those could only be of subcontinent Asia origin.

269,maryfabuk,Not worth it,2,3 August 2008,"I went to see this film thinking it was going to be as exciting as the first two Mummy films, but I was really disappointed. The story didn't make sense for a start. The beginning narrative was clear but then the movie seemed to deviate and add all sorts of things into the mix that didn't have a place there or just didn't make sense outright.It had no fluidity and the chemistry between characters was so forced and fake. The woman sent to replace Rachel Weisz did not convince me, however I think that even if it were all the original cast, this movie would still have been a let down. The man who plays Rick's son Alex is utterly unconvincing also. He might as well have been an old acquaintance of the McConnells for all the chemistry there was between them. I couldn't have cared less who lived and died in a scene to be honest because they weren't interesting enough. Brendan Fraser does his bit well though.The special effects were quite poor to say that this is mainly what the movie relies on for the horror value. They start off quite good but just get worse as the movie progresses.The best thing in this film is Jet Li, who you don't see enough of.This really was just milking the Mummy cash cow for all its worth, which is a shame because I was a fan of the first two.Die hard fans will probably go see this, but if you asked me I'd tell you to save your money and rent the DVD when it comes out instead.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
270,wizardlord-1,Oh my God! How terrible can a movie get?,2,3 August 2008,"That is two and half hours of my precious life that I'm never gonna get back! What a costly waste of time! Rob Cohen must've intended to make a spoof of the previous Mummy movies and somehow changed his mind at the very last moment. He must've thought. We have Brendan Fraser, okay... John Hannah, okay... And a bunch of fishermen for creating visual effects. Awesome! I kid you not, playstation 1 has better graphics than that! If you have seen the previous Mummy movies, you've already seen this one. The plot is an absolute no-brainer. A good bed time story for kids perhaps, but that is all it can ever aspire to be! And Jet Li had successfully made the mummy look like a puppet. The charisma and menace of Arnold Vosloo is something that Li could never get. If you've seen the movie ""The Crouching Tiger and The Hidden Dragon"" then you pretty much know what to expect from the fight sequences. The script was a half hearted attempt to mix action, comedy, drama and romance into the clichéd rise-from-the-dead Mummy plot. The acting was pathetic. Except for Brendan and John there was absolutely no chemistry between any of the other actors. Maria Bello was no substitute for Rachel Wiesz. She simply seemed to read her lines in front of the camera with no involvement whatsoever. The rest of the cast aren't even worth mentioning. The director was clueless for the most part of the movie, except maybe the credits! Screenplay was not too bad. Mediocre.A final word of precaution.

I must say that she was also more interesting.The fact that people are complaining about a mummy movie outside of Egypt must have not realized that more than one ancient culture mummified their dead. This movie made a big risk with going outside of Ehypt which I congratulate the film-makers for. This is a good movie. Whoever it is who hates it must have been a few tea cups short of a full set. This is a great movie, and you can enjoy it over and over again.However I shouldn't give it too much praise. Brendan Fraiser and John Hannah are not as good in this one as in the previous movies.

You are just throwing away 2 films full of character development. You can't expect to swap the actor over and have it feel the same. Just because you spent the first 20 minutes of the film reminding us that she indeed Evelyn, doesn't it make it so.Secondly, you should have stuck with Egyptian culture with an ACTUAL MUMMY.OK I'm done :)P.S.

Her charm, engaging smile, quirky presence and chemistry with Brendan Fraser in the previous instalments of the Mummy series, is sorely missed. Maria Bello was not up to the task of playing Evelyn.Apart from that, The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is a highly entertaining popcorn adventure despite some flaws.The negatroids really jumped on this film.

277,NoelCT,"Flawed, but gets the job done.",6,28 May 2010,"A decade after their last adventure, Rick and Evy O'Connell are living an opulent retirement funded by pulp novels loosely based on their exploits. They are trying to quietly settle down, put all that excitement behind them ... but they're just so bored. On the other side of the world, along the Great Wall of China, their son Alex is skipping out of college so he can unearth his first major dig: the remains of the legendary Emperor Han. It's not long before a ruthless general resurrects the ancient leader so as to build a new, global Chinese Empire.It follows the typical formula of the film series to date - resurrect mummy, fail to stop him achieving full power, then take him on in a massive fight - but I like that Gough and Millar embrace the comparison by having their characters react in dismay that they've found themselves stuck in the same situation all over again. And while a major set piece (Shangri La!) is completely wasted and a pair of major characters are thinly developed, they gave us a rousing action script with snappy dialogue, a surprisingly effective family dynamic, and some really exciting sequences.Though there is the occasional moment of boredom, Brendan Fraser mostly brings Rick O'Connell out of retirement with the brash, goofy charm we've come to love. He's great as ever at bounding into action and blaring orders, but there's also some nice little moments where he reflects on his family or questions whether or not his life is truly happy.I doubt he's the best person they could cast in the role, but Luke Ford does a more than adequate job as Alex O'Connell. He's got the twinkle of discovery from mom and the lunkhead charm of dad, just no presence. Not to knock Ford, I see a decent film career in his future, but he just doesn't light up the screen as well as Fraser, despite a great father/son chemistry.Then we get to the first of 3 Horribles, a trio of nearly disastrous mistakes that alone take the film down a notch. Horrible #1: Maria Bello as Evy O'Connell. Now, she's a fantastic actress and it's got to be tough to follow in the footsteps of Rachael Weitz, but Bello is completely miscast. She does decently in the action scenes, but those moments of flighty whimsy, which I'm glad Gough and Millar brought back from the first film, feel forced in Bello's clipped, artificial British accent, and there's just no chemistry there between her and Fraser.Horrible #2 is a failure all across the board: Isabella Leong as Lin, a ""young"" guardian of the tomb who bears the only weapon that can kill the Emperor. Gough and Millar fail for writing her in a clichéd fashion as a stoic Martial Artist whose fighting abilities are as inconsistent as cheap plotting requires them to be. There's also no charm that should make us and Alex instantly fall for her the way we did for Evy back in part 1. Secondly, Leong is just plain bad in the part, lacking any presence and completely mangling her dialogue.Also suffering from similar hackneyed writing (though not enough to be a Horrible) is Lin's underused mother Zi Yuan, a sorceress with ties to the Emperor. Not only is the part similarly underdeveloped, but the fantastic Michelle Yeoh should be above such roles. That doesn't stop her from giving it her all, though.Jet Li is Jet Li. He's not the most charismatic actor and Emperor Han is a cardboard baddie, but Li does have presence and you never want to be in his way when he shoots a glare your way.The f/x are a real mixed bag. When it comes to fantastical creatures, they're plain lousy. A trio of yeti (who disappear as quickly as they arrive) feel like they walked out of MONSTERS, INC. with their huge eyes and over-animated fur. And don't even get me started on the three-headed dragon and lion-thingy the Emperor morphs into. I would say they look like video game f/x, but most video games would be embarrassed with such visuals. On the other hand, the mummy himself is every bit as good as Imhotep in the first two films, and the huge finale where two mummy armies clash is absolutely superb.This unevenness is a direct result of Rob Cohen. There's moments where he cuts away at the end of a scene even though it hasn't punctuated its point. There's gorgeous establishing shots that he hurries through instead of letting us soak them in. And then there's his Cubism. For those who don't know, Cohen developed this technique he calls Cubist Editing where he repeats an action shot from multiple angles so one can better take in the moment. There's a reason why better suited for the sports videos he copped it from: it interrupts the flow of the narrative and hurts the pace of the action. He does save it for just a few key moments, but they are noticeably jarring when they arrive.And what is the dreaded Horrible #3? The score. I'm sorry, but this sounded like the type of adventure music one would find on a Saturday-morning kids' show. It's crap and does a disservice to the earlier work of Goldsmith and Silvestri.In conclusion, it's far from a perfect picture - the script could use a couple more drafts, several roles desperately need to be recast, and I can instantly name half a dozen directors that would better click with the material (Joe Dante tops the list) - but I was entertained. It gave me some laughs, some thrills, and some moments of wonder, and that's really all I ask for when I go to see a flick like this.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
278,WhenUPlayTheGameOfThrones,"""...a movie that was so obviously cheaply thrown together...""",3,5 August 2008,"I have a best friend who is obsessed with The Mummy movies (or at least was) when we were younger. I saw the first one maybe when I was nine and the second at the same age. They never stood out to me as much as a ""good"" movie but they were enjoyable. Going to see this movie, I knew it was going to be bad. I mean, The Mummy 3? If you are a fan of the series or not, I wouldn't suggest going to see this movie.Basically, its about the same characters as the first two although the wife is now played by a different actress who puts on an awful English accent. Their son, as seen in The Mummy Returns, returns for this sequel although he is suddenly about college age and his parents don't seem to be aging at all. Weird, right? Now to the plot: It's about some Chinese emperor that enslaved the people of China and made them build this big wall; The Great Wall of China. He tried to cheat death by calling on a witch who cursed him and his army and turned them all into mummies when all she should of done was just made them go poof and disappear. The movie then jumps to the present (or 1930s) and the main character's son finds the Chinese emperor and the emperor is later re-awakened and tries to find a way to enslave the people of China once more by reaching the pool of eternal life that will give him ultimate power (um, how?). The characters from the other two movies, of course, are the only ones that try to stop this mummy from succeeding with his plan. Now, if that doesn't sound like an Oscar-worthy exciting plot...it's because it isn't.There were a few things I liked about the movie besides the opening and closing credits. There actually were some funny scenes that did make me laugh out loud. But the scenes that made me laugh even harder were the awful scenes that were SUPPOSED to be serious. The movie itself didn't seem as bad when the opening began to it quickly fell into a movie that was so obviously cheaply thrown together with little character development and a love story that was more simple than a ""love-at-first-sight"" scene.Now, onto the things I didn't like. The new actress that took over for whatever-her-name-is isn't very good. Her accent sounded forced and just didn't fit with the rest of the feel of the movie. The son, who magically turned into a grown man was alright and I didn't really feel much for his relationship with his father (even when they had an emotional scene...wait, WAS it supposed to be emotional?). This new Asian girl that is the most randomly placed character in any film I have ever seen was a horrible short at a twist and a love story with the main dude's son. Their love story seemed to have been contrived of two words and one kiss. Okay so, my main problem with the movie was how awfully put together it was. The mummy itself wasn't as good as the original and the story wasn't all that interesting. Leading to an ""epic"" climax...it sort of falls flat. Also, was there a moral? Or even a relevant theme by the end of the movie? Was it something to do with father-son relations? Immortality? Or not waking mummies? I really don't know.My favorite part of the film: Yes, this isn't a part but whatever. That apparently drinking from a pool of eternal life means that you can turn into a dragon.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

281,Enosh Sunny,Not living up to the expectations.,6,18 August 2008,"The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor was a film awaited by many fans of The Mummy series. Every fan must be crestfallen after watching this third installment in the series. It simply does not live up to the expectations. The Mummy 3 brings about the entire series to a disappointing end, if it is the end. Firstly, lack of Stephen Sommers as the director is, without an impression of a doubt, visible. His convincing ability and overwhelming prowess from the previous parts become the foremost reason for this installment to be considered a substantial failure. Secondly, Rachel Weisz's absence from the screen is frighteningly dreadful. She is undoubtedly an excellent actress who brought the character of Evelyn O'Connell to life with extreme superiority. The audience cannot accept any other actress to take her place. And if there was a whole other reason for her absence, the role should have been compensated with a fine actress who could, maybe not better, but contend to her appearance and performance. Last but not the least; Brendan Fraser does not look old enough to be a father of a 20-25 year old. I guess that was the age of his son. Brendan Fraser is an exceptional actor, which he proved in the previous two Mummies. But he is not old. Both the men looked almost the same age. Please director Rob Cohen, look at them both. These are the major factors, or one could say massive flaws that brought this film down on its knees. Another thing about this film is that there was no meticulous plot. The whole story can be explained in either 3 or 4 sentences. Unlike the first two this third installment lacked a good story, dialogues, and action sequences that blend in with the rest of subplots and the main plot. The biggest concern all Mummy fans might have with this film would definitely be one word with a BIG questions mark. WHY? This could have waited for a more interesting screenplay. This could have waited for some script that revived the Egyptian atmosphere once again on the screen. This could have waited until Rachel Weisz agreed to do the installment. Or this could have waited until Brendan Fraser grew old enough to look like Luke Ford's dad. My rating for this movie goes 6 out of 10. I would have given it a 4. A 2 point grace solely for the presence of Brendan Fraser on screen. He is brilliant, magnificent, believable and handsome. His entire getup suits him inexplicably well. Jet Li had nothing to do in this film. He was hardly seen. Being a Mummy fan one have to watch it, one is compelled to watch it. But I guess people will be disappointed. Overall a very frail, infirm, decrepit film.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
282,d_eveil,"i literally shouted ""mummy""",4,13 August 2008,frankly speaking i liked mummy movies but after watching this movie i was astounded by the storyline starting with Brendan Fraser looked stupid as his kid Alex in the movie looks same in age compared to him(way to go dad) characters were misguided in the movie there was senseless action although computer graphics were good n well executed but lack of storyline which is very common and has nothing special in it its like there was a mean egomaniac powerful ruler(jet Li) was cursed by Michelle Yeoh and is trapped till the spell is broken and Jet li is released from it and now he wants to rule the world after he wakes his army of dead blah blah blah and to save the world all are relying upon guess who ..........thats right Brendan Fraser and his family good for the world but not good for the viewers i give this movie 4 because of its some good special effects and Alex turning into man from a boy and his father not aging a bit left me surprised,The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
283,daniel-bullock,Utterly Disappointing!,1,12 August 2008,"Okay, 7 years later and I wasn't expecting a brain trembling experience, it IS the Mummy after all, but it was worse than hoped for and utterly underwhelming. If you wanted cliché's in a film and how to go about using them obviously and painfully uncomfortably, then this movie has done it almost perfectly. Jet Li, an amazing martial art's perfectionist....changes into giant animals, that can chew and scratch people? Why? Even...what? John Hannah and Brendan save what dignity this film can have, without them it would be truly awful. Hannah's 'relationship' moment with a Yak is probably the highlight of the movie and if that's all you've got to say about a film...then it's got problems. I'm really not one for slagging off films, normally I'm entranced and excited, even by the bad ones. But this lacks in so much, Bello is a little painful to be fair as well and why replace such a character? Weisz has given it so much chemistry and Bello has none, she tries hard...yes...but it doesn't make up for it. And as for their son, is he the same age as his Mother? One final thought for a possible 4th instalment, just go with the son and maybe John Hannah - if he wants another final payday, which is disappointing for such a good actor - and just do something FRESH and NEW.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
284,snow-mblu,"Kept the spirit of the mummy, unfortunately not the actors!",6,4 August 2008,"Before watching this, I admit I was scared. I'm a big fan of the other mummy movies and I was afraid this would be totally off the normal franchise of the mummy series. I mean, there is no Imhotep; the main actress Rachel Weisz was replaced and so was the actor who played the O'Connell's son before (Freddie Boath)...It is not as good as the others, but it kept the other movies spirit. Its jokes (especially on John Hannah's character - Jonathan - Thank God for him) and its action. A lot of people disliked the appearance of some unexpected enemies and allies, but in the mummy series there was always a lot more than just mummies, since this is a fantasy movie. The main story despite not having Imhotep was not that awkward, and fits in with the essence of the other movies. Brendan Fraser and John Hannah outshone all the other actors in every scene; they're great as always!! Jet Li, Michelle Yeoh, Isabella Leong and Luke Ford (despite the problem I mention below) did a good job!The main flaw in this movie was the poor casting. Sorry Maria Bello's fans, but she was the biggest flaw is this movie. She had no chemistry with Brendan Fraser; she exaggerated her accent the worst way possible; and completely killed the spirit of the smart, courageous and strong Evy, becoming a cheesy and flat Evelyn. She was boring to watch and her acting felt forced. I like Maria Bello (liked her a lot on ""Jane Austen Book Club"", for example), I just didn't liked her in this role. And let me ask this to Hollywood, are there no British actors? Because I don't understand why they keep hiring American actors and force them to play as British, just hire British folks already!!! Also regarding casting, for those of you who remember The Mummy Returns, you'll also remember that Alexander 'Alex' O'Connell was British. Then why the hell is he American now? I know they replaced the actor, but shouldn't they at least keep the nationality of the character the same??Overall, it's a funny movie, not as good as the other two mummy movies, but still entertaining. I just pity the poor casting!",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
285,katt_36,Complete disappointment!,1,5 August 2008,"I knew after seeing the commercials for the movie that it wasn't going to be a success; however I still hoped that it was going to prove me wrong. Well my first assumption was right. The first two Mummy's were fantastic, both in my top twenty of favorite movies. This movie has to rank in my top five flops. It was as if the director was trying to make the movie as flashy as possible - the terracotta fights scenes, the yetis, the explosions - and ignored the rest of the movie. He completely missed the mark for the plot and the character development; even his action scenes weren't as exciting!The plot needed much work in my opinion; it seemed too bland, in the first two Mummies' were exciting and kept you on your toes. This movie was dragging along and made me beg for the story to either get better or to end. The characters, urgh, well there was no chemistry at all! Especially between Brendan Fraser and Maria Bello, I'm sorry but Bello was awful in this movie. Her accent made me cringe (I know she's American and it's hard to mimic the English accent, but come on, her accent made her sound as if she had something stuck up her a**). If it wasn't her accent then it was her acting, she tried to fill in Rachel Weisz shoes but she completely failed. Rachel Weisz was the heart in the other two movies, without her it made this movie even weirder. But that aside, I know I shouldn't bash Maria since she did try, the acting was also disappointing. Brendan Fraser wasn't that bad and of course John Hannah is still good at bringing the random comic relief in the movie. Besides that everything was mediocre, Luke Ford seemed like he was running around try to figure out how to deliver his non-existent performance. I was also looking forward to see some cool fight scenes involving Jet-Li but those were short lived; his death was also lame and too quick. He's supposed to be some powerful emperor yet he gets beaten in less then ten minutes  lame. Jet-Li usually does great fight scenes but this was a joke.Through out this movie I tried hard not to roll my eyes and I actually sat through the whole thing. After the first 30 minutes I was ready to leave the theater, yet I stuck through, I wasted 112 minutes watching this garbage. This sounds probably like a hate/bashing review, but it really was a let down for the other two previous Mummy movies that did so well.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
286,mvpax-2,Another special FX dazzler,5,5 August 2008,"The mummy : tomb of the entertainment.The mummy is one of this movies with nice special effects, a low but justifiable story and some good jokes.The first movie had everything of it, a solid thing of entertainment. The second movie had also some good moments (i like this tiny pygmies)but the third is only a special effects monster, no really good jokes and a lame story more worse as the second one.There is no tension all is predictable the only good and really new thing:NO Bad Germans in it WOOHAAA the curse is broken ^^But back to the story : The two main chars are bored as hell. so the first 30 minutes shows us how boring there life is (instead of years ago).They get all they want a nice home with everything but no action. So the audience has to be also bored by the first 30 minutes. I don't know if its good or not for the atmosphere....but it wasn't good for my moods.the rest of the movie you see the old school mummy action, much explosions, FX, transformations, Snow(jabba)wookies (snowsasquatch)....dont ask! there is no reason for them. This cute Chinese girl screams anything and voilá they appear....angry, loud and pitiless the most unnecessary moment of the movie. At the end two undead army's are fighting.Its definitely no Top 2 movie, if you are interested in special FX watch it.

I almost got the same excitement as I watched the Indiana Jones for the first time. This is definitely better than the 2nd and 3rd sequels of Indiana Jones and it is the best of the Mummy for me. I enjoyed as much as I did for Dark Knight. This movies is more than just Brandon Fraser, he is not bad in it. The story, special effects and all characters are very well done or composed. Not sure why so many people bash this movie. Go see it and judge for yourself. The promotional clip did not done justice for this movie, it is much better. The scenery is beautiful, so is the young Chinese actress. Jet Li did a great job. The sfx of the Terra cotter warriors against thousands of zombie was spectacular with humor.

288,fightrunner,Just Let The Dead Ret,2,18 August 2008,"The summer movie season is drawing to a close now, all the more lacklustre popcorn movies are slithering onto the big screen ( Hell-boy 2, X Files 2 etc.) and here we have a movie that aspires to be lacklustre. Now when i heard that this was being made i asked why? the first movie was a decent piece of cinematic fluff, the second was average at best but hardly sequel worthy. Then news came the both Stephen Sommers & leading lady Rachel Weiz had seen the script and had bail-ed on the project, hardly a smooth start. So here we have it now Mummy 3 in which the O'Connell's son Alex now in his early 20's and estranged from his parents. Will he get back to loving his Mum and Dad and going round for Sunday Dinner? Do we care?.Also his parents are looking damn fine for their respective ages (it has been worked out that for the ages to work the O'Connells would had to be 14 when they conceived Alex). Anyway Alex is doing an archaeological dig in China and recovers the mummified corpse of the dragon emperor (Jet Li) and  well you know what's coming don't you?.Emperor Rises From Dead.Brendan Fraser utters a smart-arse one liner.Heroes Chase Undead Emperor.Brendan Fraser come out with a glib line Two main characters fall in love.Brendan Fraser has a witty piece of dialogue Big CGI battle.Brendan Fraser has a 'funny' comeback A supporting character on the goodies side dies a heroic death.Brendan Fraser states the obvious in a humorous(less)s fashion Everyone Lives Happy ever after.Brendan Fraser smirks with a bit of observational humor Hint at possible sequel.Brendan Fraser ... you get the picture The End.And therein lies the biggest fault of all  The plot. It is just a carbon copy of what has come before no new elements are added in, just a change of location for our heroes. It all feels very tired and laboured as a result as if the cast are merely just going through the motions almost like a toddler reciting the times tables. The script is just an uninspired, carbon copy of what has gone before. The only bit of originality is in the O'Connells domestic difficulties (the spark has been lost from the marital bliss) which are more daytime soap opera than summer blockbuster. The whole process has a 'Do i really have to feel' and by the end you will feel the same way the O'Connells did at the start - starved of any real excitement.This brings me to one huge bone of contention here that of the acting. The returning cast : Brendan Fraser & John Hannah are poor but then with such a poor script i can't blame them. But this in now way excuses the movies (and we all pray not the franchise's) newcomers. Maria Bello as the new Evey doesn't work, Bello puts in such a wooden performance that in any other movie would have had viewers feeling like turkeys at Christmas. But she is still not the worst!. Luke Ford as Alex O'Connell is even worse than Bello and makes Alex such an unlike able character that you question how even his parents could still love him. Still though Ford is not the worst and believe me the worst in this movie is truly dreadful. Isabella Loeng who plays Alex's love interest is truly appalling in what must be the worst acting performance this year, laugh or cry? I pray that you never have to sit through this to find out. At least Michele Yeoh does a good job with her part but then she is woefully under-used here and just a bit player.The action scenes whilst looking decent just feel as bland and unimaginative as a 24 hour GMTV marathon, with nothing standing out as amazing or original. Overall we are in the dregs of the movie year right now and this ranks down there with the worst of them. Why the powers that be decided to try and bring this franchise back from the dead we shall never know for sure. But please Hollywood let this rest in peace now , because making this you have robbed what was an entertaining enough pair of movies of a humane death.A dull brainless romp that should never have been.For more reviews check out www.fightrunner.co.uk",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
289,pecaro0518,Great movie!,9,15 August 2008,"We just saw this movie, despite what we've read and heard. We loved it! I don't get upset about discrepancies about ages, like the age of the son in the movie, when you see a movie, you have to use your suspension of disbelief. I love that people know there are undead fighting, but have a hard time ""believing"" some aspects of the movie. Cracks me up. So the ages are off, so what! The movie is great. Maria Bello is great as Evvie, don't let comments by others fool you. So what if it's not the girl in the other two. Life goes on. She's great!The fight scenes are great, the movie's a lot of fun, and Jet Li is great, too.See this movie, give it a chance with an open mind, utilize your suspension of disbelief as you should in this type of movie and ENJOY!It's GREAT!",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
290,king_nick_the_1st,That thing you do when you check your watch...,5,12 August 2008,"How is it that the O' Connell's(Fraser and Bello) manage to have a son well into his twenties? This was a one question from the trailers alone I have been wondering, that could have been answered during the course of this movie but it isn't. Rob Cohen's most recent endeavor has been at the helm of the new Mummy movie; while my opinion of him as a film director continues to float around. He has made some decent movies in my opinion (Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story, Dragonheart, and 10 years from now, the will be a classic The Fast and the Furious), he's also had his share of duds (The Skulls, xXx, Stealth). While a huge fan of the previous two Mummy popcorn flicks, it seems that Cohen dropped the ball on this one, but it wasn't all his fault.Where to start how this movie could have been better... Ah yes actors... Maria Bello was horrendous as the replacement for Rachel Weisz, she provides a god awful over the top English accent. Then, for some reason Bello and Luke Ford (who plays her son, and is by far the worst actor in this movie, like a bad 80's B movie actor kind of worst) had more chemistry together than her in movie husband, Fraser. Anyone who watches movies knows chemistry on screen is usually a good thing between two people. However, when mother and son chemistry comes across as sexual, like it does in this movie, it's down right creepy (there is an awkward talk about the birds and the bees). As for people who go to see this expecting a Jet Li show case (like every other movie he's in), without giving away any spoilers, you'll be disappointed to say the least.At this point people might be wondering if there is anything worth going to see this movie about? Maybe... Brendan Fraser is this movies saving grace, he is one of Hollywood best 'classic type' leading men, if he was around 50-40 years ago he would be huge. At standing 6'3 and a large build, with strong facial features and the voice to match, its impossible to take your eyes off him. Even though this movie isn't good, this is the kind of movie Fraser is made to do. He showed this in the first two Mummy's and not in Journey to the Center of the Earth.The story of the movie is another flat factor. It felt rushed, and helped accompany the terrible script, which was clunky and poorly written. Honestly though, who goes and sees a movie like this for its script or story? You go for the action! The action though isn't much better, it's rushed and doesn't have the kind of lead up to make us appreciate it, and the lack of Jet Li doing ""his thing"" was kinda disappointing. However, the sequence in the snow was mildy amusing, it didn't make up for this otherwise unexciting movie.Pros: Brendan Fraser, is an expert at taking scenarios and making them grand, even when no one else can. Hes done it before, and he really tries to do it again. Oh, and some of the action has its fun moments.Cons: Bad script, rushed story that felt like it was only waiting for the pay-off (the pay-off being the action), and when it finally comes to some, one could only be disappointed. Other than Fraser, the acting was horrible, even for a popcorn flick.Overall: Maybe something parents would watch for a fun experience with their kids (does have some violence and swearing though). Or if your into the mindless drivel, other than that save your dollars, and rent it or maybe don't even bother, your not missing much. If you watch it in theaters most likely you will end up checking your watch to see when it's over.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
291,matthewmacgyver,Well Made Mediocrity,6,2 August 2008,"The Mummy 3: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor - I liked the first entry to this series. About all I can remember of the second one was that it sucked, and it's loose spin off ""The Scorpion King"" was merely O.K. in a ""I get a kick out of Conan-type movies"" sort of way. Compared to the first, the Mummy 3 trades off memorability in it's characters for larger action sequences. Being the 3rd entry to this series, this is somewhat forgivable as most of the characters are already developed. The movie still suffers though as it seems as though they have less to do as characters and more to do as props, and this unfortunately also goes for the new characters introduced.This movie knows what it is, and as such, carries with it a level of self awareness. There is even one scene where the new actress playing Evelyn addresses the audience, almost winking, and says ""I'm an entirely different person"", poking fun at the obvious point her character has been recast. It was cool seeing Jet Li as the Emperor, and as a villain. But that's really all he was, the villain. Unlike the first Mummy movie, where they treat the mummy as an actual character with identifiable motivations, the movie does very little to develop The Dragon Emperor as anything but the antagonist for the action set pieces. But Jet Li is good, he somehow makes the few scenes he was given work, his villainous sneers and smirks work well in portraying a one-dimensional popcorn villain... I felt the movie would have been much stronger if he had more screen time than his CG counterpart.The martial arts and sword fighting sequences were filmed in a typically Hollywood style with far too many cuts and closeups. The action would have benefited from pulling the camera back a bit to see more of the action. There are a few points about the plot where you find yourself asking questions that simply can't be answered, but the movie's plot is the kind you're not supposed to think about, but instead are just supposed to sit back, relax, suspend your disbelief, and enjoy the ride. If you are able to do this, there are a few parts in the movie that will have you cheering.It would have been a lot better if there were 15-20 minutes more character development and exposition, but that would have put the movie over the 2 hour mark, and it's pacing might have suffered, and it's box office definitely would have. As it is, the Mummy 3 hits it's mark as being mass market (barely) digestible popcorn. The movie's story plays as somewhat of a cross between Dragon Wars and Indiana Jones 4, and with respect to quality, it falls somewhere in between... although is admittedly closer to the Indiana Jones 4 end of the spectrum. The movie is what I would call ""well made mediocrity"". It managed to entertain me. If the Mummy 1 was 8/10, Dragon Wars: D-War was 5/10, Indiana Jones 4 was 6/10, then I would have to peg The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor at 6/10.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
292,selstad84,"Been there, done that",5,7 September 2008,"Such is the story: A, obvious, evil Chinese emperor seeks to rule the whole world. He starts by killing every king in the old Chinese dynasty. But the only enemy he can't win over is death itself. Seeking out a old witch who can help him become immortal, he finds some old book, the witch helps him, he betrays her, she curses him and such is the story.Ever heard it before? Well move the plot to Egypt, spice it with some love story, and you in basic have the first Mummy movie.That is the biggest problem with this movie, it's done before. Everything in this movie is done in some way or the other in the 2 first movies. Wake up an old mummy, checked. The mummy seeks to rule the world, checked. The mummy controls an army, checked. Even the ""change into some beast"" is checked as it's done in The Mummy returns where the scorpion king is awaken.So the story is at its best thin and at its worse I hide my face in shame. The director has used almost everything from the 2 first movies and even managed to spice it with the oldest clichés known to movie kind.And to the last, the acting is not the best out there. Brendan Fraser is doing a OK acting but that is the best of them. Maria Bello is trying very hard to fill the shoes of Rachel Weisz but fails in such a fashion that it hurts. Evelyn's character feels so different from the 2 other movies that I hardly believe it's the same movie line. Even Jet Li as the Emperor himself fails to fill the role very good.All in all this movie is simply not worth it. They have milked everything they could milk from the Mummy concept yet they continue, yes, Mummy 4 is on its way.So all in all, if you don't have anything else to see then this might fill the time, but if you have something else to do or see then do that instead.

However, despite having Jet Li, who along with Jackie Chan are 2 of the most entertaining actors in the business, I honestly think the movie stank.The plot holes were big enough to drive a truck through, or chariot with undead horses.Michelle Yeoh was killed off unnecessarily, her long time lover could have been resurrected easily, Shang Ri La still exists, and all they can do is leave it open for ""another"" sequel in Peru.BF was entertaining, as was the little boy that grew up.

Except the fact that Rachel Weisz wouldn't be in this one...That is a downer already for itself...The movie has it's same revolving plot from the first two...Which is... Someone finds the mummy, someone releases the mummy, Brendan Fraser and friends shall defeat the mummy...AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS MOVIE WAS...I have to admit, the whole China feel had some potential...I liked the direction they were going...Something different.What I thought after the movie: Never make mummies Asian again.It was laughable.I felt so embarrassed for Maria Bello, who played Evie as replacement for Rachel. You have to think first...One of the main characters of the previous two movies which were MAJOR HITS, rejected this THIS movie... WHY? Because she knew the script sucked. She didn't want to ruin her career with an embarrassing movie. I thought she could have just gone for it because the movie would have been 10 times better if she was in it. Without her, there was NO chemistry whatsoever between ANY of them. The awkwardness killed me and I felt it throughout the whole movie.Brendan looked like he didn't want to be there and was forced to be in this movie... Where do I even want to start with Maria...Horrible...Awkward...Trying to be cute...Horrible rendition of our beloved Evie.. The son...Why does he look so old? If I could remember, he was only about 10 in the last movie and Brendan looked like he aged about 2 years older...Him and Brendan had NO chemistry and didn't even appear like they were related... Jonathan...Basically the only good thing in the movie...He had amazing humor and kept the audience entertained throughout the whole movie...He was the only non-awkward character in this movie... Jet-Li wasn't bad for not having any lines for the movie...I just wish his character was stronger...He was DEFINITELY forgettable unlike IMHOTEP...The part I laughed most was probably when Jonathan mentioned the ""casino"" and his night club named, ""The Imhotep's"" The action...It wasn't bad. It wasn't as ""edge of your seat"" good...It was okay...It was an eye opener, but I expected more...The most beautiful scene was shown in the commercial which is when Jonathan was running away from the avalanche in slow motion.Oh and there were yeti's. Yes. Yeti's.Overall, I kind of wish they didn't make another movie. Yes, it had potential to be totally rockin', but unfortunately it DIDN'T. Sorry.

Maria Bello has the worst British accent I have ever witnessed on the big screen. The special effects were horrible, I might associate them with a movie from mid to late 90's. There are also a few of those ""what the frak?"" moments. Like when Evelyn and Johnathan jump out of a the firework truck they are clearly stunt doubles. Then that thing Jet Li turns into at the end of the movie when he's fighting Alex and Rick looks like it came out of ""Where the Wild Things Are"". Finally, when Johnathan dropped that bomb on the Chinese jeep then the driver and gunner end up being well enough to fight I was thinking ""they should be blown to smithereens on the battle field"". There are also major changes from the original movies. It's more actiony/violent than the previous movies, the O'Connells kill people on a dime and people are having their limbs pulled off by horses and heads are being cut off. Another thing that I had a MAJOR problem with was the fact that Alex has an American accent, but in ""The Mummy Returns"" HE WAS British!!!!

But is a Rob Cohen, what i could expected of this kind of movies that are directed by Cohen? The answer is nothing, only stupid action scenes, regular acting,quite stories.

299,greamamerican,this will kill off the whole mummy franchise,1,4 August 2008,"It was so painfully awful. I regret paying money seeing this yesterday. Let me explain the things of element of why the movie is so painfully and dreadfully terrible. The first bad is that i thought it was going to be an epic history about but the filmmakers decides to have mummy in Asia as well which is very historical inaccurate. And the drama is too hard to mixed with action and comedy combined together. Whenever moments it comes to comedy and stuff, it failed to lived up to the expectations as the previous mummy series. Flat jokes also rubbed pretty rough just like the previous series where they had the same fate as this one. This is also too well rock centered for Brendan's character because it more of a vehicle to him rather than a supporting characters. Also the special effects are quite poorly cheap and the action between rick and Han played by Jet Li falls flat to the floor. Rob Cohen direction were kind of shaky and lost control of Sommer's touch as the previous series. it might kill off this mummy series for good. if you like the first two mummy films, you might be disappointed at this.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

My husband and I rented this movie at the beach one day because it was raining and I honestly thought during the part they were riding around in the horse and buggy...is this a comedy?"" Because it was the most HORRIBLE movie I have seen in a while. I am a major fan of the first ""The Mummy"" and I was just in high hopes this would be great like that one. But there were SOOOOO many cheesy parts it was pathetic. What about the part where the big snow monster dude threw some other dude, then the other snow monster threw a touchdown sign. I MEAN COME ON!

302,alerasoul,Attention! Mummy Fans!,3,26 January 2009,"I voted this movie a 3. Why? I will tell you, but first a little back-story. Please excuse the length...I absolutely love the Rick O'Connell character. He's funny, adventurous, and sweet-talking. This is the Rick O'Connell of the first two movies. I wanted so badly to see this movie in theaters but never got the chance. Finally I rented it. I thought, ""Hey! This is gonna be great."" I completely understand how terrible the first two movies are. I do, and yet I love them. I love the tongue-in-cheek jokes and action-packed adventures that Rick and Evy have together. The plot lines were anything but good, but still they're some of my favorite movies.This comment is directed at die-hard mummy fans, of which I'm a part of. Now, you may be a Mummy fan and think, ""Oh wow! Another adventure for Rick! I'm gonna love this!"" And now you'll go and rent the movie. Please listen to me: DON'T DO THIS.I could care less about Evy's character being replaced by Maria Bello. All I care about is Rick. I love the character. But this isn't the same Rick. This isn't Stephen Sommers' dashing grave-digging gunfighter, this is Rob Cohen's fancy-ass altered-personality-about-everything guy. He's completely changed, unfortunately not for the better. His character strongly resembles that of Indiana Jones from ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" who's concerned about his son, with his school, with everything. No more adventures, just confusion.The first two movies are fast-paced, only this one is faster-paced. The story's exposition in any part of the movie takes place in 3 minutes tops. Everything else is just a blur of action, but you don't feel the same kind of excitement. This can attributed especially to Randy Edelman's score. His ""grand"" theme for ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" is practically comparable to that of ""The Thief Lord"" or ""The Goonies"": kiddish. Then the sound editors completely ignore the score when the action takes off for Rick in the first chase. At points it's hardly noticeable and you think, ""Where's the score? Oh THERE it is... wait, now it's gone again."" Nothing special at all.There's no danger presented for anyone. Even when Rick is stabbed through at one point you still can't help but know he'll be all right, because the story has only gone through an hour. Another thing lies with the fast pace. There was just too much in too little time. The movie is less than 1 hr. 45 min. The death of the emperor is much too soon. You don't get time to hate him or feel anything toward him. Same with Alex's love interest and the love interest's mother dying. You feel no sadness, no pity, no nothing! Just, ""Oh, she died. Can we get on with the story?"" You understand why she died, of course, but there's no emotion to feel. The action doesn't compensate for anything. You would think (just as I did) that the action would make up for the lack of character development like in the first two movies. But no, these terracotta soldiers go down with one blow. Just break 'em and you're done. No danger there. At least in ""The Mummy"" you had a villain that interacted with the characters. Here he's sort of... far away. Only dealing orders out through his minions. Nothing else except in the end, where there obviously has to be a showdown. In ""The Mummy Returns"" you had the little pygmy mummies that actually posed a danger because there were thousands of 'em. You also had the Anubis warriors who could only be killed a certain way. You had danger. You had to be careful. Here it's just a knock on the head and your enemy is vanquished. A couple of bullets and you're done. No jeopardy. NOTHING.Then there were obvious little things, like the snow being fake. This is noticeable throughout the scenes where they go through the mountains. The snow just flicks around like it's sand. It's distracting to the viewer and careless of the filmmakers.I rate this movie a 3 because I am warning the Mummy fans who loved the first two movies. PLEASE, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. It's a different Rick. Too fast-paced. Too short. If you must watch it, get it from your library; don't bother paying money. Again, I'll say it: I like stupid films. I loved Van Helsing. I like all kinds of movies that are bashed and bruised by critics as well as regular watchers. I tried to like this movie. I even promised myself that I'd watch it again if I didn't like it and that I'd brainwash myself into loving it. I've done that and it hasn't worked. It worked all the time with me but it didn't work this time; it's just a bad movie. That's all there is to it.Mummy fans! These aren't the same characters that we came to know and love: the Stephen Sommers version. This is Rob Cohen's interpretation of Rick O'Connell and family. Don't watch. Save your time and money. Don't make the same mistake I did.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
303,Eksolat,Disappointing,5,1 August 2008,"One thing I have to say is that I'm not acquainted with ""The Mummy"" series, and this was the first one of the series I've seen so far. However, I can say that this movie is mediocre at best. It's a movie that you'll probably see once due to the epic battle scenes and realistic special effects that hyped this movie up and made me want to see it, but after seeing it, you'll be grossly disappointed and never see it again.The acting is far from top-notch, and the story is just like some standard action/adventure movie, and nothing too interesting or gripping. Granted, there's nothing wrong with lots of action and special effects, but without the story, character development, emotion, and other aspects, the movie is dull and nothing more than a 2-hour display of bombast and mindless fighting.So the final word is, if you want to see a movie with lots of fighting and special effects but not much in every other department, go see Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
304,avinashbhan,I Have an Idea cast Rachel Weisz and remake the movie should work better!!! :-),6,28 August 2008,"I just saw the movie today I got this screener copy of Mummy 3 and guess what it was no different from other Mummy movies except for the very important fact that it had no Rachel Weisz. I am not sure if she was approached for this movie or not but if she was she probably made the correct decision by declining the offer, as far as Brendan goes I like this guy but I don't know he dint look like at his 100% too (or may be he dint want to do this movie too but was keeping a promise or something :-) ).The story is kind of same as previous Mummy movies just that they should have convinced Rachel Weisz for the movie because Maria Bello was not good, Brendan and she dint look like a good couple they dint have that on screen chemistry.So if you have a way to see this movie free don't miss it else you can skip this one!!!!",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
305,djean,I loved it! Best film of the summer so far,10,11 August 2008,"First let me say that i am a huge fan of the first two mummy movies and place them on my list of my all time favorite movies. So when it was announced last year that a third mummy movie was gonna be made i was ecstatic. However, when i heard Rob Cohen was taking over Stephen Sommers as director, that Rachel Weisz wasn't coming back because she didn't want to play the mother of a 21 year old, and that the setting was being moved from Egypt to China and that Arnold Vosloo would be replaced by Jet Li as the main baddie i started to get worried. I was happy to see Brendan Fraser and John Hannah return back to their respective roles from the previous installments. So days and months passed as i eagerly awaited this movies release and finally it came earlier this month. My Verdict As you can see from my headline i really liked this movie it exceeded my expectations and brought a sense of fun back to the movies that has been sorely missing this summer. Credit must be given to Cohen and his writers for having the balls to spit in the face of realism at a time when movies are moving away from fantasy and delving into reality in order to critique this 9/11 word we live in. Sorry people when i go to the movies i want to be entertained i want my movies to have lots of campy humor, non-stop action, and a plot with a beginning, a middle and an end that's simple enough to follow. Mummy 3 delivered all of this in spades. So Bravo to all who worked on this movie.The other thing i liked about this movie was the obvious nod to old school Ray Harryhausen monster movies such as Sinbad and Jason and the Argonauts. What i mean is this film had lots of monsters, we get a three headed dragon, abominable snowman who use a bad guy like a football by kicking him between two towers making it look like a field goal, clay statues come to life, and a terra cotta army is raised from the dead to fight the bad guy and his army. So as you can see as a fan of monster and action movies i was in heaven.Lastly, let me just say i was appreciative of the non-stop humor this movie provided and unlike The Dark Knight i left the theater in a good mood.So my friends ignore the snobby film critics and their vile comments against this movie and the whiny internet fan boys who complain this was to campy and cheesy for them and go see it for yourself. I promise you will have a good time like i did and bring the whole family if you can.P.S. Definite DVD buy when this comes out",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
306,glenngor2001,The most awful acting ever,1,27 December 2019,"It's such a shame that the makers of this awful movie didn't invest as much of the big budget on acting rather than entirely on special effects. The producers clearly abandoned the acting, sacrificing what could have been a decent movie. The so-called 'actors' must have been desperate and willing to accept a minimum fee since even children in a school play could act better. The most amazing aspect is that the producers had the audacity to make a follow up movie. As someone with a university degree in Film and Media, this and its sequels are without a doubt the ""worst"" movies I have ever seen. Save yourself the frustration of wasting time you'll never get back.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
307,TheCaptain_And_TheKing,I couldn't even make it through the whole movie...,1,25 March 2009,"Surely in order to give an unbiased and fair evaluation of a movie you have to see it in its entirety. However the very fact that I was incapable of enduring this farce is testament to how truly dreadful this was. In my defence I watched it for almost an hour and a half during which time I was able to observe the unfurling of a tired and mediocre plot lifted from its successful predecessors, coupled with strangely convoluted dialogue which attempts to deepen the whole affair to no avail. Add to that a complete lack of atmosphere despite its potential, and a group of actors who appear to have been forced at gun point to participate, and you have what could be considered to be the worst major release of the year. Brendan Fraser looks very unhappy in his reprisal of Rick O'Connell, and if this is due to sharing his screen time with the awful Maria Bello instead of the captivating Rachel Weisz then you can't blame him. Bello, born in Pennsylvania it would seem, sounds as English as Nelson Mandela; but this is not the extent of her failings, and if anything this only emphasises how completely useless she is in a role truly embodied by Weisz. Of course Luke Ford, the now fully grown Alex O'Connell, could have made the character his own; but instead has as much charisma as a cactus. Of course when you consider the fact that he looks like he could be Fraser's brother rather than his son, the illusion is somewhat shattered from the outset. Jet-Li meanwhile may as well not have been in the damn thing. Spending a huge proportion of the movie (roughly 80%) in a CGI guise, he has little impact on screen. Yet when he sheds this computerised skin he has none of the presence or malice that was so apparent in Vosloo's portrayal of Imhotep. Needless to say, Jet-Li barely even phoned this in. It looks like he got a secretary to do that for him. Director Rob Cohen has much to answer for: Namely the death of a wonderful series. It seems that he has relied almost solely on patching up this crap-fest with CGI. Clearly the franchise has always relied on the use of such methods due to the very nature of the story, but when you consider that the original was released in 1999 and looked more solid and impressive visually, you have to wonder how big the budget was and what they spent it on. Most probably it was Fraser's fee to actually put his career in such jeopardy. In summation it's hard to believe that 'The Mummy' was once considered to be the new Indiana Jones. In truth it may be harder to believe that they actually thought releasing 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' was a good idea. Needless to say, even the latest Indy abortion still puts this to shame. Overall, I would suggest that anybody wishing to torture their eyes and ears, and waste their hard earned cash as they do it, should get a copy of 'The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor'; or as I will now be affectionately calling it, 'The Mummy: The Bad One'.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
308,maheshkoneru,Decent watch but the magic of the earlier versions is missing.,6,31 July 2008,"The first and most important thing I would like to say is that Rachel Weisz is missed terribly in this version. Her beauty and and charm are just not present in this heroine.Having said that, The Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is a decent watch if you can ignore the illogical and often stereotypical storyline. For folks who want a fun time and don't mind the lack of depth in the script, this movie is just fine.The special effects are good and the battle sequences are pretty decent. Plus there are some good Jet Li moments in the film. Michelle Yeoh looks pretty ravishing in the beginning of the movie.Brendon Fraser does not impress as much as he did in the earlier versions and the same can be said of the rest of the cast.Take a lot of popcorn into the theater and watch it on a big screen with good sound effects. That might just be able to spice up this offering.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
309,dstudie,Why was this movie made?,1,21 December 2010,"After watching this movie I am left wondering why this movie was made. There was huge potential for this film but it was squandered and not even the talents of Brendan Frasier and Jet Li could save this movie from bombing. While the concept was a good one, the lackluster writing in the wayward script destroyed any chance of this being as good as the other two movies. Plus replacing Rachel Weitz with Maria Bello was a really bad decision. A British actress would have been a much better choice. At least they could have used someone who slightly resembles Weitz. Bello is a good actress, but she just did not fit the part in this film. All in all, this movie should have never been made or gone straight to disc and not the theater.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
310,evo-lander,Grow a set,8,16 August 2008,"I was waiting to buy a ticket when I heard a couple of boys talk about this movie for which I was to purchase a ticket. ""It has Jet Li in it, how good can it be,"" said the boy who seemed to be wearing a pair of pants three times his size. 'Lets go and see Singh is King"". This is the type of reaction that you get where I live to any films that have Jet Li and Jackie Chan or any other martial arts actors.What does this have to do with my review. Nothing except that I went ahead and bought the ticket and guess what? I enjoyed the film.This movie is no worse than say, Pirates of the Caribbean. What I found really interesting is that most people who enjoy movies like that are calling this movie rash and unbelievable.This movie had the humor, the visual effects and the presence of good actors to make it work.And it did.What is really gonna be interesting is the reaction from the whiners when they hear that there will be a sequel. No wait, they will still go and see it and whine about it some more even though they should have had the sense not to go and see it.Iam sure my review will have almost everyone saying they won't find it helpful, considering most of the readers only come to this page to cry and throw tantrums about how awful the movie was, hey, someone had to say this.As for those who were saying the actors lacked chemistry, heres an idea.

311,bakes5981,Fun and disappointing at the same time,6,12 August 2008,"If action sequences were the flesh to your favorite movie genre, The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is yours, because it contains very little body fat. This movie is, frame-by-frame, probably the most action-packed movie to date. You have barely recovered from being on the edge of your seat and suddenly the movie delivers another exhilarating action sequence.This third installment of The Mummy franchise is not all praises, from this end of the viewership at least. As an avid movie goes, the movie caused me some disappointment. Yes, it is a fantasy movie with the mummies and magic and all, but I felt like I was cheated when even the human characters and the human-man things were above the laws of physics. At least three things disappoint. In no particular order, they are: (1) The landing of Mad Dog Maguire's airplane. The approach of the landing was, in very few words, off! Should not that plane been blown to pieces with the impact it endured during landing? And then there's the barfing yak. Why was it that only Jonathan Carnahan was the victim of the barf shower then in fact the plane tilted almost a full 90 degrees towards it's nose? Yes, it may be funnier to see Jonathan to be at the receiving end of the yak's regurgitation, but it might have been funnier if Brendan Fraser and Maria Belo had some on their faces too. (2) That paramilitary general who aided Emperor Han must have some superhuman strength of some sort or he would not have survived in the avalanche. He was caught in the middle of the avalanche, just like everyone else. Emperor Han himself was blown off the top of the Eye of Shangri-La's tower and yet this fanatic was able to hold on to the rope bridge the way he did. Strong grip right there! (3) Again, that fanatic general did not die with the explosion of his jeep, suffering only burns on the face and other parts of his body minus the pain these burns bring. Also, even after the explosion, he still seems to have his full human strength. Should not he have died from that blast already? Zijuan claimed that if Emperor Han was to dip in the pool of immortality, he would regain his powers and be able to shift-shape to the most hideous of creatures. To begin with, his human form was hideous enough, thanks to Jet Li's imposing presence. And then there are the two other forms. Any dragon, by its own rite looks hideous. But the Third form it took looked like a fluffy, over-sized dog with a head full of horns. Check out the close-up scenes on this big puppy and you will see the eyes did not look menacing; they were inviting! For me at least.I think I just lost my fear of mummies after I watched this movie. Some mummies are clumsy, while others are just undead sissies. There's this scene where a mummy accidentally knocks off another mummy's head which is very reminiscent of a scene from Star Wars. And several times, mummies' heads came flying off their necks screaming ""aaaaaaaaaahhhs"" or ""eeeeeeeeeehs"". The first couple of times were hilarious, but the third time was just annoying. Talk about rehashed jokes.Finally, I wished Rachel Weisz was on this movie. Rachel seems to be the perfect contrast to Brendan's character  Rachel's angelic face contra Brendan's rugged modern, swashbuckler features.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

I am so glad that I won't have to ever see this again. I'm also glad that Rachel Weisz decided not to take on the movie part as it would have reduced my esteem for her too much. The movie basically had a very, very thin plot. I mean, the good guys have to kill the bad guys and guess what happened? A large percentage of the time was spent with the characters engaging in quite pointless violence. They rarely spoke; most of the time they yelled or screamed at one another. Their fascination for guns and explosives was tiresome (they should have know from the previous two episodes that YOU DON'T KILL MUMMIES WITH GUNS!!). It reminded me of the time we played cowboys and Indians as children, running around purposelessly in circles going bang! bang! and very quickly tiring of it.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
314,rugby_rox_09,Rachel Weisz should have been there,1,1 August 2008,"I've been a fan of all 3 Mummy Movies up until this one. Probably the instant I realized i hated it was when the new actress who played Evie showed up on screen and my me visibly cringe. Overall, the movie sucked ass. Terrible special effects, terrible acting by all, especially Maria, and horrible writing.Rachel Weisz should never have left this franchise, but it's clear as to why she would have. Fraser looked like he wanted to be somewhere else, somewhere very far away from this set. Ford needs to be shot. He took the character of Alex and buried him, then shot raised him up again just to shoot him and bury him again. He butchered that character, most notably because he has an anomalous American accent, something that is very strange considering he was raised in Britain, but now I'm just nit-picking.The final nail in the coffin for this movie comes in the form of the release date. Though, at the time of this writing, we are heading into the 3rd week of the Dark Knight, that movie is still sweeping the box office.

317,diego_castro_95,What a disappointment,1,23 August 2008,"The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is an attempt to completely end an idea that was once a very good one. But why don't we start with the good things. 1.The production is excellent. Great effects. Awesome clothing. Good photography. Those are the things that justify the 5 stars. Till now you may say, so then why doesn't it have a ten? Because movies are made of other stuff, more important stuff. 1.The acting is terrible. The only remarkable actuation is Brendan Fraser's. The rest are terrible actors, what happened with Rachel Weisz? Thanks god she didn't participate in this movie, she would have ruined her career. And Maria Bello certainly didn't know how to replace her. The worst actors were probably Isabella Leong (Lin) and Luke Ford (Alexander O'Connel) 2. The plot of the story is truly plain, so obvious. And there are things you don't understand, like Why did they send a very vulnerable couple with the diamond, if they could send it with various soldiers in a government's plain where it could ""possibly"" be more secure? 3.Stupid jokes, all the time there are stupid jokes. And after one joke happens you're like, ""Am I supposed to laugh?"" ""Was this a real joke?"". Honestly, the theater in which I was only laughed twice, and not that hard. 4. Too short to be so bad. If a movie is to be short, then make every scene valuable and don't have all the real action for the last part. When the movie ended I was like, ""Ah, so that's it?"". Believe me if you are ever caught by credits in a movie, you didn't enjoy it. You wanted more. I don't say a movie has to be long to be good, but even if this movie was long it would still be a shameCONCLUSION: Rob Cohen and his awful ""Running Man"" ideas ruined the idea of the Mummy, the first and second were good movies.

320,The_Messenjah200,Surprisingly not entirely crap.,5,27 December 2008,"I rented this movie with little to no expectation. It's a good feeling when you expect something so bad that the actual product can only be better than what you've prepared for. I assumed this would be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I was surprised. Yes. It's bad. But it's not terrible. I'd watch it 100 times over utter wastes of films like Elektra and the latest bilge to spew from the American Pie camp.Pros:-The action was pretty enjoyable. -Pretty much in classic Mummy fashion. -It retains the atmosphere of the original film despite the change from Egypt to China -Jet Li. That is self explanatory. -The Rock is not in it. -Greater than or equal to the Mummy Returns Cons: -Where is Rachel Weis!? The new lady does about as good of a job acting wise as Weis, but she doesn't retain the charm. I pretty much fell in love with Rachel Weis when I saw The Mummy as a kid and no one can replace that. -Alex has apparently lost his British accent... I dunno, pretty sure he had one as a kid in The Mummy Returns. Continuity much? -Ridiculous creatures. Why would a mummy with the power of the five Chinese Elements feel the need to become a tired, cliché, three-headed dragon and/or an Irfit ripoff? Also, Yetis fighting for the ""good guys""? OK... -The dialogue. Oh man... I actually burst out laughing at one of the spells read towards the end. Haha, I'm chuckling right now. It was cheesy.Now, it seems that the bad outweighs the good by far here. But having enjoyable action and retaining the classic Mummy spirit balances them out.The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is not an artsy film. It is a disposable action adventure film meant for cheap thrills. It delivers these. You won't find a deeply significant meaning. You will find guns and killing of things. The goal is to entertain and I suppose it does that well enough.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
321,dazend1,I wanted to get up and leave the theater,1,5 August 2008,"Just another movie that is relying heavily on special effects rather than acting. Unbelievable, I just wanted to get up and leave the theater. Bad Acting to Some Acting and then No Acting pretty much sums up this movie. On the other hand, it is great for kids and if you want to get a good laugh at the story itself. It would have been fun to have the budget they had spent on this movie and put it towards something more entertaining. Stock up on Popcorn, Candy & Drinks to help you make it through the movie. This is one movie that you don't have to worry about missing anything important just because you have to take a bathroom break. The nice thing about it is that you can take a break anywhere during the movie and not miss anything. I think this movie was just made to show our support for the Olympics being held in China and to help boost their economy and help to promote their film industry.

322,richyreay,Utter Drivel,1,21 September 2008,"I did bear in mind the fun nature of the previous two films, but this was utterly awful. The replacement cast was dreadful, the script weak as a day old kitten, and Rob Cohen's direction lackluster and listless.After proving that he has some acting chops in the likes of Gods and Monsters, I expected better of Brendan Fraser who seemed to phone in his performance along with John Hannah. It's easy to see why Rachel Weisz turned this one down. As for Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh, here are two titans of Chinese action cinema who are woefully underused. While the special effects are adequate they are nothing we haven't seen before. It seems that all the crew, cast and effects team really didn't bother trying very hard.Miss this one.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
323,Griff5516,Yetis Kicking Field Goals?,4,10 January 2017,"Now let's just begin by saying this movie is bad... Yetis kicking field goals at the gate to Shangri-la, Ricochet Rick playing golf with mummy soldier heads, a shape-shifting Chinese Emperor, throwing chunks of your clay face as a weapon... I could go on. The point is, this movie was incredibly off the wall. While I understand that this goofy craziness was probably the plan all along, the reason why I did not enjoy this film as it was meant to be was because it was supposed to be a continuation of the Mummy movie franchise. For that reason, I think there was a certain line of craziness that was made by the previous two movies that needed to be stood behind to keep that element of continuity. Instead, this film takes it to a level that never should have been reached! Yes I laughed out loud at some of the silliness, and at times found myself enjoying certain action scenes / movie moments, but overall I am giving this a 4/10. It deserves some credit, but did I enjoy it? No. Was it a good way to end the O'Connell Mummy trilogy? Definitely not.

325,humewg,Very disappointing after the first 2,4,14 August 2008,"I was a big fan of the first two movies in this series. One of the things that made those movies fun was that the cast (especially Brendan Frasier and Rachel Weiss) seemed to be having fun acting in the movie. That seemed to be missing in this movie. Another great attraction to the first two movies was the interplay between Brendan and Rachel's characters. While Maria Bello is a good actress, she did not, for me at least, bring the same fire to the role of Evie as Rachel.I found the special effects to be good in the movie, but in the first two movies, the effects helped enhance the story. In this movie the effects tried to carry the movie. The story felt flat, and there was no way for special effects to overcome this.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

It left such a bitter taste for me because I just loved the original cast members so much. Racheal Weiss MADE the character of Evelyn and without her, it just did not feel like the Mummy. I couldn't get past that. I couldn't watch the movie with a clear, unbiased mind because of it. So. Yeah. I own the first 2 and specifically wouldn't buy this one. Never will. Sorry! <3 The movie itself was okay, very average at best. Just kind of made a mess of itself. First 2 were fantastic though.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
327,suntonova,What was I thinking even bothering to watch Jet Li in another U.S. film?,3,1 August 2008,"So, for some reason I had moderately high hopes for this installment of The Mummy. For one thing, I was sort of expecting it to be mostly ""Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" that was just using the hype of The Mummy franchise to market it... oh how wrong I was. This movie is such a complete waste of Asian talent, it is like buying an imported, antique, Chinese dinner table, setting some Ikea chairs around it, throwing on a Martha Stewart K-Mart table cloth and topping the whole thing off with place settings made by Chinette and Dixie. I'm sure no one needs any convincing that Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh can do action scenes without the use of elaborate editing and camera angle tricks. I get the impression, however, that Rob Cohen has never seen Hero or Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon like the other 90% of American movie goers. Even in fight sequences involving only Li and Yeoh we see nothing but the same short-cut editing and extreme closeups used to make Brendan Frasier look like he can fight. Wait, no, I take that back. The Frasier fight scenes were actually better edited. Apparently the team knows how to film bar-brawl choreography. In other complaints: When did George Lucas become the role-model for script writing? When you have poor dialogue there is only so much that can be done to salvage your performance. Natalie Portman could do little to compensate for it in Revenge of the Sith and Yeoh and Li can do little with it here. As for Frasier, well, his goofy expressions were about all I expected of him anyway. As for Isabella Leong in her U.S. debut - sorry sister, I hope you get another opportunity to show us what you can do, because from this audition we're not getting much. Besides the dialogue we still have nothing. What little chemistry we got from Frasier and Weisz in the original installments is completely missing here. With the role of Mrs. O'Connell picked up by Maria Bello (who actually can act, check her out in History of Violence for one of the... well, for a memorable sex scene) we have absolutely zero chemistry between the couple, despite the middle school idea of romance they attempt to portray. Also consider the evil villain we have wasted. We start with probably one of the most documented evil dudes in history and we reduce him to a less dimensional monster than what we find in rubber suits. So much more can be said about the complete banality of this movie. CGI that belonged in Ice Age with a dragon that is way too reminiscent of King Ghidorrah, and a plot that is just.. nothing, it's the plot of the second movie, but less inspired. I was actually bored. Even with all the ways you expect and allow for a movie such as The Mummy: whatever to fail, you at least expect to be ""entertained."" This movie does not. My advice: If you are looking for something to watch when your showing of The Dark Knight is sold out, just go see Step Brothers, at least that movie is funny.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
328,Spit_and_Image,Yeti (American) Football,2,4 August 2008,"I see some people liked (maybe even loved) this movie, and it usually seems to be because they thought it was ""fun,"" for whatever reason.That's fine - everybody's obviously entitled to an opinion. But I'm siding with those who thought it was ridiculous, even for a movie about MUMMIES.To explain that, I could go through and repeat what most of those people said, but it's already in their comments. Instead, I'll just leave it to describing one thing that truly sums the movie up for me - during a set piece action scene in the Himalayas, a yeti kicks a Chinese soldier up between two spires, and a second yeti watches, sees the man fly between the posts, and LIFTS ITS ARMS TO SIGNAL A FIELD GOAL....I want my money back.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
329,yeomanflood,Not bad at all,10,11 January 2009,"I have decided that I need to start adding my comments on IMDb (which I had rarely done before) just to offset all the comments from other people that I tend not to agree with. Sure, when I see a solid 7 or 8 on IMDb, the movie seems to warrant that type of score, but lately I've been seeing a lot of movies that are not bad that are getting unfairly hammered on their scores. On average I probably watch over 300 movies a year - now that doesn't give me a Masters degree in film or whatnot, but to be able to have an opinion about an art form it doesn't take a degree. So to all of you scanning IMDb comments like I do, consider pausing with this one cause I'm gonna try to give you my view straight up. Enough of that. The key to all movies is expectations. Going into the theater or before renting the movie - what were you expecting? Before you go and see a mummy movie that is an action/adventure, I do not think expecting a lot of great acting and academy-award winning chemistry is reasonable. I do, however, expect decent/good acting; if you get great acting/chemistry - that's icing on top. Like others commented - at a high level this movie follows the formula of the previous ones. That's not a bad thing since I cannot imagine a new and amazing mummy story featuring an Indiana Jones wanna-be couple. I also think some of the casting might not have been the best, but I did not see any blaring failures. John Hannah was a refreshing character this go around whereas I think he might have been a little too much of a winner in the past. I also do not think Maria Bello did a bad job at all - I tend to think that when a major character is covered by a new actor or actress, you should not expect the same result. Thus the question to me isn't whether or not she was as good as Rachel Weisz or whether she would have done a better job, the question is whether or not Maria added or detracted from the character in the story. I found her to be attractive, pleasant and physically capable for the role. She seemed to meet the threshold for me. Now the weakest link was Luke Ford - with the worst chemistry with the other characters - so there you could argue he did not meet the threshold of ""good enough"" for me; poor casting in my opinion in terms of both his acting and age. In sharp contrast to other reviewers, I found the humor in the movie to be good - though perhaps not as often or funny as I would have liked. Pace of the movie was great - either the action or the environment of the movie kept me interested. Some of the sets were very detailed although not historically accurate. The action and the CGI was excellent - the choreography and editing was done very well. I truly despise the tendency of modern action to either focus too close to the action, cut too often or overuse camera angles - this movie did none of those; anybody who complains of the use of wires in this movie needs to stop watching action/fantasy movies that involve thousands of undead - that's like complaining about the use of stunt people. If you are looking for another action/adventure movie (cause you've seen a ton of them like me) or you like the Mummy movie series enough to want to see another, you probably won't be disappointed. If you're looking for amazing acting with action/suspense/adult themes go watch Lantana, The Blackbook or 300. Solid 7.5 (7 is a solid ""good-enough-to-watch"" for me. Gets the 0.5 for the fact that I like the Asian theme without being over the top, i.e., racist, and I like the Mummy series, Michelle Yeoh, Jet Li and Brendan Fraser).",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
330,JCPadmore,What total rubbish!,1,21 August 2008,"Evy's ""English"" accent is patethic. Her acting is also totally rubbish. Also, how come John Hannah uses American language when he is English and why the hell do film makers these days always insist on making these things into family films and having parents and their kind involved??!?! There's also really boring love interest where they start off being annoyed with each other, but then later on they fall in love. Such crapola!! Another thing - how can those parents be the same age as their son??!?!? The special effects are useless - they're not even worthy of the Xena or Hercules TV shows! The gags are inane (i.e farting Yak's) and childlish and the bad guys are predictably poor. There is far too much car chasing and aeroplane crashing, etc to be taken serious - this is just action for action's sake. Dialogue is limited to the standard ""we've got company"" comments(i.e baddies have arrived to join in the quest)and then more action involving vehicles, guns and ridiculous acrobatics. Also, how come everyone always knows what will kill the Mummy or where something is hidden??!?!?! If everyone knew, why the hell didn't they dig it up or destroy it before?!?!?

The story is good and everything is linked (I don't like only the snow men) and logical. He is right when talking about the joke every 10s, but I think their jokes are OK. It make this movie 70% funny and 30% action + effect. The effect can be not so high but completely it is not bad. The actors act good. The sound also good (I like the gun sound in the snow temple).

Brendan Fraser's constant look of surprise leads me to believe that he was duped into doing this movie. Poor guy. And recasting Evelyn? What a joke. Seriously, this one makes The Scorpion King look like an Oscar-winner. Don't pay to see this movie. Buy some lottery tickets instead. Or send your money to Brendan Fraser directly.

The plot flowed very well with some creative and fun twists.(In reading some of the negative reviews I have to wonder if the commenter even saw the same film. Some of the plot complaints mentioned do not agree with what was actually in the film.)

I am no Mummy Fanboy, I just love getting to see movies before the mainstream does. I always attend film festivals in North America and Europe. I enjoyed the first two, but thought them a bit violent and not comedic enough for a children's film (come on, you know they are for children). This one is full of fantasy violence and is considerably more funny than the first or second one. Beautiful scenery, and beautiful action sequences make this movie one of the best of this year. The plot follows that the Mummy hunters from the last movie (Rick, Alex, Evelyn, and Jonathan) go to China to stop some disturbed mummy emperor. Without much blood and gore this is a great movie to take your kids too, but it might be a bit scary. The only thing holding this movie from getting a ten is the slightly weak acting, and bad scripting (though it is funny). I would recommend it to everybody who has a sense of humour. - http://www.gemizo.net",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

336,sreenadhmenon,"Lacks a lot from the original, other than Rachel Weisz.. - 01",3,6 August 2008,"I found this interesting lines from traydickens in the forums,It's EITHER Jet Li OR Jackie Chan. It's EITHER Iron Man OR The Dark Knight. It's EITHER The Mummy OR Indiana Jones. Since the answers to the first two are obvious we Will take the last one, I think Indiana Jones was better. I won't say that it was ""WAY"" better, but I enjoyed watching ""Crystal Skull"" more than ""Dragon Emporer"". I think the creators have tried pretty hard here. The plot was descent, some twists were there and excellent CGI though over the top.So what are the issues. If you liked ""Crystal Skull"" and this is the first movie in the mummy franchise you won't find much issues, believe me.On the other hand if you are already a fan of the first 2 movies and are planning to watch this movie with the same expectations, boy, you are gonna have a terrible time. The MOST irritating thing for me from the start of the movie was how similar the plot was compared to the originals particularly with mummy returns. And believe me I didn't feel a thing watching those nail biting chasing and some comical dialogs in between. Mummy Returns have already shown us this in a much much better way. I thought and prayed that once Jet Li takes over the proceedings as ""Mummy number 2"" the movie will gradually take off. I didn't take long before I as able to find out how terribly, wrong I was. Jet Li, I admire him, just didn't fit the role. he is too small and does not induce that power and personality that the Mummies should have !!! Unfortunately for him Arnold vosloo had already set the bunch mark for the Mummy. And in my opinion how ever hard he try he will not reach and that is certainly not his fault, mind you. It's just a huge miscast.Dear sir Rob Cohen, how did you manage to waste an actress like Michelle Yeoh this way?

337,Azy_Zimmer,"If it had been free, I'd still want my money back.",1,10 August 2008,"First, let me say that the sets in this movie were awesome. They weren't anything we haven't seen before but still well done. Unfortunately, that's pretty much the only nice thing I have to say about this movie. I won't say that all the acting was bad, either. Michelle Y. was very good in her role as the immortal Chinese witch. But Brendan Fraser lacked any character. It seemed like he was just trying to get through the movie without killing himself. It's not his fault, though. The script felt like it was written by high school students except that high school students might have done better. There's no flow and certain parts just grind it to a hault. Add that to Rob Cohen's horrible editing of this film, it feels like a carnival ride with every trick in the book thrown in for fun.I know this was a fantasy flick but I still can't buy yetis making football references, a mid-30s looking Fraser having a twenty-something son, or a grown man yelling ""smack my a**"" when his pants are on fire. This movie aims for cheap laughs, fast-pace but unthrilling action, and a love story that makes no real sense. It assumes the audience is mindless. Also, there's no real mummies in this movie.

I was not best pleased with this major detail to the movie, the amount of money they spend on special FX they could of found away to get Rachael to do it. However like all mummy films it still had the action, the cheese, and the silly jokes to make it good enough for you to watch it.On a whole it was alright... nothing to write home about though. The film just didn't seem the same without Rachael and Maria Bello just didn't do a good enough job.The other thing is that Alex the son is just too old. You don't get the feeling that time has passed and the son has grown up.So this is probably the worse of the 3 but if you are a Mummy fan like me, you will for sure be watching it no matter what people say. Hope the next one is a little better and they bring back Rachael.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
339,SorceressDamia,"Not bad, but not great, either",5,9 August 2008,"When I saw the trailer for this, I was really excited, but when I read the reviews for it, my excitement waned a little bit. Maybe that's why (that, and the fact that I don't bore easily) I was satisfied when I saw it. It was okay and kept me entertained, but there were also a few things that I didn't like about it: The movie really didn't have the feel that the other two did (and I'm not talking about the change of location...it's not that, it just didn't feel the same). I really missed Rachel Weisz in this. Maria Bello tried her best, but she really didn't nail Evie's character the way Rachel portrayed her. Even though she rejected it because of the script, I think that Rachel Weisz would have made it a better picture...plus, she had great chemistry with Brendan Frasier in the other two. Maybe if she had been in it, he wouldn't have looked so bored. I really didn't mind Luke Ford's acting much--it seems to be a main gripe that he didn't do a very good job--but I have to agree: he was way too old to be Brendan Frasier's son. That, and I also found the romance with Alex and the assassin girl silly. There really was no substance to the relationship, nor any big interactions between the two besides a little bit of flirting. It was nothing like in the first movie with Evie and Rick.But my biggest gripe about the movie is that they messed up Evie's character. She's an Egyptologist. Egypt is her passion...she knows the language and the history. So when did she suddenly know so much about China and how to read ancient Chinese? No wonder Rachel Weisz didn't agree to do it.Bottom line: It's not terrible, but there are a few things that bring it down. Also, the ending hinted at a possible sequel in Peru. While this one was tolerable, the thought of another Mummy movie without Rachel Weisz makes me cringe.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
340,charlescurtis2003,Better than it gets credit for,8,2 August 2008,"No, this Mummy doesn't come even close to topping the first one, but I would argue that it is as good or possibly even better than the second one. Yes, there are several things we can quibble about (Brendan Fraser's son looking as old as he does, abominable snowmen from out of nowhere, and a very ho-hum love story) but this movie was not made for the Oscars, people. It was made so that we could check our brains at the door and have fun, and the movie does deliver on that count.I really liked the idea of using the real-life terra cotta army as the basis for the story. Granted it's not historically accurate of course, but there is a lot of mystery associated with that tomb in China and I feel that if you want to make a $175 million summer popcorn flick with that as its basis, so be it.Overall, good escapist nonsense.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
341,czianoIJ,Cack,4,6 August 2008,"Well.. I went to see this film on its debut and had to queue for 30 minutes to experience the end of the mummy series. I have read that Maria Bello and Luke Ford have signed up for more fun-filled CGI Mummies however after this showing it will be direct to DVD.Rob Cohen had a hard act to follow taking over from an already popular franchise and he attempted to take it in a completely new direction, however he has failed. This film centres around Alex O' Connell and the tomb of the dragon emperor. Alex (Luke Ford) Is not too bad as he looks like his dad Rick (Brendan Fraser) But he hams it up and attempts to play the lead role and poorly attempts to replicate him. Fraser is not the same action packed player as portrayed in the previous movies, He is an old fashioned tomb raider and past it on this showing. Evelyn - now played by Mario Bello has not got the same chemistry with Rick (Fraser) They seem like complete strangers throughout and her tackey English accent seems to be enough for her to be the replacement for Rachel Weiz.... Well Give me a Wig and i'll do it better..Jet Li is not in this film very much (and when he is, he is portrayed by a suspect looking poreclain figure who breathes fire) and i believe he is only here as he is massive in asia and this will probably push the Mummy 3 ahead of Batman!! - Good move by the producers ey!!!The only saving grace for this film is John Hannah(Jonathan) as his character has not changed and he is the same bumbling divv as he was before- he offers mild comic relief and opens a nice plot for any future films - please no!!!!Overall The mummy needs to take a rest for a while, despite its popularity and its millions at the box office- where can it go???",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
342,Rjinswan,The 804th best movie I've ever seen!,1,2 August 2008,"(Out of 859 movies I've seen thus far)As I sat through this tedious collection of disjointed scenes, I kept telling myself that that which does not kill me makes me strongerThis movie played like an adventure video game: it moved linearly through a short series of locations in which action shots took place. The only purpose of each (very simple) plot complication was to move the actors along to the next location. The scenes ramble on seemingly endlessly before the plot complication takes place, mind you.The Mummy 3 also suffers from an identity crisis: while one segment takes itself very seriously, the next one will be chock-full of slapstick humour. Sometimes these are concurrent, such as during cheezy romance scenes that one can only hope are *intentionally* bad.The fighting and action might have been worth it, except that somehow even the action shots simply seem to drag on. How many different angles do we need to see of groups of zombies knocking the others to pieces?Can I say anything good about it? Well, some of the f/x don't suck. I laughed twice during the slapstick scenes. I managed to avoid gouging out my own eyeballs.I'm still quite upset, because that's 112 minutes *gone* from my life; 112 minutes that I'll never see again.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
343,StarGlitter,Great summer blockbuster! Smashing action scenes!!!,10,31 July 2008,"This film is the third installment to the The Mummy series. Even though this blockbuster action film had a very predictable storyplot and was like every Hollywood action script (it had the must-have love story, bad guy-good guy, fighting, the silly funny sidekick), it was still very entertaining and was funny in many parts. And everybody loves humour right?-especially when watching a summer blockbuster. And to think that Jet Li and Brendan Fraser and Michelle Yeoh got to work together! Holly Molly!! 3 stars rolled into one! Can’t get any better than this!!I wanted to go to the cinema to be entertained with action scenes and to laugh and my wish was fulfilled when I watched this. Its action scenes were smashing. I thought the 3 white yeti monsters were so fantasy-like and so outrageous and hilarious….i mean out of no where they come to help and seem to know who the enemies are. While watching this movie, this movie made me forget about everything in my life. I was quite engrossed in the movie. The sound effects were better than I expected, especially during the avalanche scene. The special effects were definitely Lord-of-the-Rings standard especially the battle scenes between the Emperor's dead army and the Emperor's dead skeletal enemies and also when the Emperor's skeletal enemies rose from the dead. The whole movie was much better than I expected even though i knew the script was going to be very very predictable. I am surprised many people gave bad or okay reviews. Like one of the reviewers in IMDb said, this movie had ""beautiful scenery and beautiful action sequences that make this movie one of the best this year."" The scenery of the Himalayan mountains and the sandy desert and the old mansion house in England and the busy streets of China and the Shangri La green land with its waterfalls were truly a feast for all eyes. This particular Mummy movie also is less gory and has MUCH more sense of humour than the previous Mummy movies. Personally I think that this is the best Mummy movie so far.I actually would have preferred if the amazing famous actress Rachel Weisz resumed her role next to Canadian actor Brendan Fraser for this Mummy movie but she didn't. I can only pray that she reprises her role in the next Mummy installment which I am sure will be made in the future. THe sidekick at the end of the movie said he was going to Peru...and there are Aztec and Inca pyramids in Peru hence another Mummy installment!!!! But her replacement, Maria Bello knew whose shoes she had to fill and her great acting in this movie made the loss of Rachel Weisz less saddening. I am Malaysian therefore I am very, very proud and happy that the Malaysian Chinese actress Michelle Yeoh played one of the main characters. Michelle Yeoh acted really well and she should get more roles in Asian movies and in Western movies before she gets too old because I really believe if she has the opportunity to showcase her versatility and acting skills and if she got the right role in a great movie then she can win a golden globe award. And she can speak both English and Chinese fluently and eloquently unlike Zhang ZiYi. I could tell from her acting and all the movies she acted in (The Touch, Sunshine, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) that she can do not only action films but drama and all other genres.In this movie I sometimes thought that the attention was too much on the movie character Alex O Connell and other movie characters instead of Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz's characters at the beginning of the movie and would have liked it if the movie was longer so that the original Mummy hero Rick O Connell played by Brendan Fraser had more screen time and more things to do. I don't know whether it was just me and I don't know if others have noticed but I thought Brendan Fraser looked a little sad (maybe about the movie script and Rachel Weisz’s absence) at the beginning of the movie. I could tell from Jet Li's acting and facial expression in the movie that Jet Li concentrated a lot on his role and he did a great job too.To everyone out there, The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is one summer blockbuster not to be missed!!!!!

344,morgana13_13,An insult to my intelligence,1,1 August 2008,"Not a funny moment in the movie, not a scary moment in the movie, insipid dialogue, a complete and utter waste of my time. Too bad, I had high hopes for this one. Rachel Weisz (sp?) was greatly missed, and while Maria Bello is a fine actress, was just not the right actress to fill Rachel's shoes. The actor that plays Evelyn's brother (John Hannah?) is supposed to be the comedy foil, the funnyman. Funny, he was not. Irritating, yes, and why they bothered even bringing him back into the story is beyond me, as all he does is whine about the situation. Now, I don't mind a good, whiny actor and a good whiny role - Kevin J. O'Connor is the best of that lot, and was great in the first Mummy. But the actor playing Evelyn's brother is not. Not even the great Michelle Yeoh (not to mention the awesome Jet Li) can save this dud. Use your movie monies to see ""The Dark Knight"" again instead of this stinker.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
345,zeil9523,Better Without The Mummy Name Attached?,5,31 August 2008,"I think that was their main problem here...This would've worked a hell of a lot better if it had been just another random action movie, because it's not necessarily bad... it's just that ultimately it doesn't really feel like it is part of the franchise.The characters wondering around the screen may share the same names as the ones we've all come to love, but that is ultimately where the similarities end. Even the roles still filled by the same actors feel almost out of sync- almost but not quite.I understand they were trying to avoid a carbon copy of the prior movies, but severing all ties with them wasn't the way to go about it.Also the changes seemed so god awfully unnatural. Evie and Rick becoming frigid and English and largely estranged from each other and their son. Alex bitter and distant. Jonathan... who although unchanged still managed to seem not quite right.Also no offense to Jet (I love him I do) his character was a poor substitute for Imhotep though and the lost of Ardeth was another downer.Finally the fight at the end- Rick, I love you I do, but you would've had your arse handed to you. I mean seriously consider the fight from the end of the Mummy Returns and then this one and I think you'll pick up the problem I have with it.All that said- it's not a bad movie, it's a passable action, it's just a really weak sequel.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
346,mohit115,bad bad bad movie,1,1 August 2008,"The first reaction which you get once the movie is over is Wow! What a total waste of something which could have been made so good. The new movie has absolutely nothing in it, no scary moments, animations are shoddy, actors have no expressions, the storyline is non existent and the comic part, which used to be integral part of the mummy series, is no where. If you remove Brandon Fraser from the movie, one would think it's a B or C grade Hollywood flick.Don't know why Brendon Fraser and Jet Li decided to do this movie? Money might be the only reason as I am sure they'd have seen the movie is going no where. Jet Li has just got a bit role to play, as in most of the scenes he's the animated rock bodied mummy. One of the major let downs is the acting by Brandon's on screen son and his new actress wife, yes, the old charming Rachel Weisz has been replaced by someone called Maria Bello (the one in the World Trade Center movie of 2006) as Brendon (O'connell's) wife. This just adds to the woes though, because one does miss the charm of Rachel Weisz. Anyways if she was to be replaced, why did you had to bring her back from the dead in the end of mummy 2 ? O'connell's son is played by Luke Ford who more than to the frill factor, adds to being irritating with his bad acting. What irritates more is that in the first half the movie focuses more on him and not Brendon.The movie could have been made so good, because the story was there, the actors were there( I mean if they included Rachel Wiesz as well), and the audience expectations were there. Just that it was never allowed to develop properly. Movie moves in two parts, you just get a rush of action for 10 min and then another 20 min, it goes all very slow, then again 10 min of fast action and then 20 min very slow and it goes on and on and on.At the near end of movie, O'Connell's wife asks Brendon , "" Did you regret anything?"". Well, my answer is , yes, I regret wasting my money, my Friday night's around 2 hrs and above all I regret seeing a movie from the Mummy series, which I used to love immensely, fall so bad.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

Firstly Maria Bello doesn't know what she was doing and looked like she knew she didn't belong in the film. Even John Hannah couldn't keep me watching the rest of the film, and I think he is great.Even though I didn't like this one, the first two won't be chucked out my good movie list because they were great its just this one was a let down (a big one).

I initially went thinking the Mummy was going to be amazing and Batman the opposite. How wrong could I be??? Whether it was poorly directed or badly funded, it just failed from beginning to end, terrible acting, Maria Bello, who i usually like was terrible, portraying a posh English lady, there was no connection with Brendan Frasier and both looked uncomfortable throughout the film.

349,pmperry-1,Not a Great Summer for Brendan Fraser,6,10 August 2008,"This has been some summer, first I read about the Hype of the Dark Night and was surprised when the movie surpassed the hype... Then I read about the Mummy 3 and was surprised that to some degree the critics were just being truthful.Now let me first say that the Yeti are as much a part of Chinese History as the Terracotta Army so I'm not opposed to them being in the film as this film is fictional (when was the last time a Mummy actually got up and walked around?).Second, I would like to add that at no point in this movie did the Son look older than the Father! At some points they looked close in age (too close is just as bad as older) but not older and I was watching the whole movie to search for any evidence of this.Now with those out of the way let me just say this movie fails in 4 places...1. Evelyn was always a clumsy, adorable girlie girl and at that's what we loved about her! Well, sadly they took her in a different direction and Maria Bellow wasn't really a bad actress but the role she was playing was closer to that of Lara Croft than Evelyn O'Connell and unfortunately it just didn't work!2. Luke Ford is not a great actor and at no point during this movie did I ever believe he was Brendan Frasers Son, this kid almost single handedly ruined this film and hopefully they won't go where I think they're going.3. Hollywood stepped way outside the lines trying to build on the Mummy Franchise by setting us up for future movies with new stars... It was blatantly obvious that Luke Ford and his new found Girl friend were in this movie with the sole intention of making them the next generation of O'Connell Treasure Hunters... Unfortunately, they even stole lines from the first Mummy's romantic encounter and that was just cheesy... Basically, if Luke Ford didn't work in this film he's not going to work in a sequel either!4. Jonathan had a few witty one liners but for the most part the rest of the crew had very few moments that were funny at all and this script had plenty of energy for the commercial that never carried over into the film! They needed to rework some of the dialog to make for more memorable parts and they clearly didn't see this need. Unfortunately, it's hard to tell if the director wasn't partly to blame for this.So, the Mummy 3 Promised Real Big Action and Adventure but failed to deliver a quality product. For Brendan Fraser, this has to be a bummer because this is two weak movies in one summer!",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
350,Tamooz,what the ++ck was that,3,3 August 2008,"i never thought that the movie would be this bad the story was probably written in one day..there were no events, no surprises no thrills nothing except a very expected and very boring story that ended in a non sense the cast... i believe that Rachel weisz is irreplaceable.. no hard feelings bit the new Miss O'connel is not even comparable to the original.. Jet Li did not show up in the movie and we did not see any Jet Li fancy move the effects i admit were the only medium level category in this movie with the use of some sound effects that could make some thing directing the movie is another weakness point which did not even try to save some thing from the old good heritage with some lousy tricks and very few jokes and that is it i was very disappointed when the movie was over and i couldn't stop myself from checking the time every 5 minutes during the movie",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
351,s_e_a_n_77,"Starts off slow, but gets better",7,17 September 2008,"OK, I saw this movie last night expecting a that Brendan Fraser was going to have a fight with Jet Li, failing at first, but then somehow, Fraser would find a way to out fight the martial art expert, probably over pure brawn. Not the scenario. Alright, there's my opening paragraph. Now to explain the title of this review. The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor starts off with a telling of how the Emperor became mummified/enchanted/cursed/mouldy. It turns out that he wanted to be immortal so he sent his general to get a witch that could make him immortal. When he sees the stunning beauty of the witch, he tells his general that no man may touch her. However the general does the big no-no and ""touches her"". Hmmm... this is sounding a little familiar. Wait a sec... Didn't Imotep (the mummy from the first two films) do the big no-no? And then was punished for it... as was the General... Obviously the filmmakers didn't want anyone to pick up on this so they made the introduction long and boring so that people fell asleep and forgot it. Unluckily for them, I watched it and it was atrocious... But fortunately Brendon Fraser made an entrance which, while not roll on the floor laughing funny, was humorous enough to let me forgive the film a little bit for the first scene. OK, now that the title is explained let me properly break-down the movie. Mrs O'Connol has been replaced with a different actress and with a little in-joke we learn to love her almost as much as the previous actress. Also, their little boy isn't so little any more and discovers a Tomb belonging to a ""Dragon Emperor"", opens it, blahdiblah the mummy comes back to life. Or should I say Terracotta Emperor? Or should I say something between the two? I don't know, and I don't care and the following chase scene is exciting enough to make sure of this. All in all, this third installment to the Mummy franchise will probably be the last as all in all... it wasn't that great. Wasn't that bad either, but my mind will soon discard it into the pile that also contains movies like Scary Movie 4, Star Wars I and II and The Da Vinci Code. See it if you're a fan of the last two.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
352,info-16314,"""Die you mummy movies, die!""",3,12 August 2008,"Oh dear. Hollywood is meant to be home to some of the world's top movie makers so why is it that so often we come out of the cinema uttering the words ""the idea had so much potential, but...""I loved the original Mummy movies and thought that much of their success came from the perfect casting. So the loss of Rachel Weisz was a huge blow and almost put me off seeing the movie. However, I was tempted by the inclusion of Jet Li and so ventured along. Big mistake.As feared, Evie's replacement lacked charisma and had absolutely no chemistry with Brendan Fraser's character at all. In fact, she spent the whole movie grinning at him (much like Karen Allen in the recent Indy flick). You just can't replace an actress as individual as Rachel and the whole movie sorely needed her.Another irritation is that (also like the Indy movie) Brendan was sidelined for a younger action hero when there was absolutely no need. We don't go to a movie wanting to see our heroes' kids beat up the bad guys, it's just a reminder to us all that we're getting old. We want some escape from that!The whole Dragon Emperor concept was fantastic as it is based in historical fact (he really was seeking immortality) and it also played on the mysticism of the Terracotta Warriors. However, after a fantastic introduction, it was then sadly under-developed.Jet Li was seriously wasted here. When you get Jet Li to appear in your movie as the main bad guy, you don't just reduce it to a bit part and get him to snarl a lot. Jet is a fantastic actor (especially in Mandarin) but I feel that the only scope he was given here was to 'be evil'. Even if they had played more upon the fact that he had been scorned by the woman he loved, it would have given him a bit more meat to work with and given us some sympathy for the character, like the original mummy. There was no character development whatsoever, a huge wasted opportunity.Michelle Yeoh was an unexpected and very welcome bonus and all 3 points that I have given this movie are for the fight between Michelle and Jet (brief though it was).I think I shall stick to Hong Kong movies in future, they very rarely disappoint in the way that Hollywood does.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

Cool action scenes are what grab you in this movie, but it seems to have lost the wit it had in the first 2. Problems: 1. I HATE THE NEW ACTOR for Evelyn. Rachel Weisz plays her so much better. 2. Jet Li did pretty much nothing awesome. The few fight scenes with him are nothing spectacular, though the final battle with him was kinda cool. overall, Ill give it a 6.5, rounded up to a 7.

It's worth watching just to see Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh. The Yetis were great. Just a mindless action movie with some great effects scenery you should see on the big screen - don't wait for the DVD. There was a lot of negative press before hand about Rachel Weiz not being in the film. Who cares? The character is 20 years older now and very different. It's not like the Mummy movies were ever known for great acting. The lines are really cheesy and the relationship problems typical to parents and their young adult children were exaggerated.

She looks as if she is taking the p*ss, and looking at Brendans face he thinks it too. The acting is so bad from everyone but Brendan but because everyone else's acting is so bad it makes him act bad... You get the impression that he is forced to do this film and while filming it knows to well how bad its going to be! I cant say that even Rachel Weisz could have saved this film, when you get bad acting mixed with a very very bad script you will always end up with a bad film!

I have always believed that the first one failed to became a horror movie and, thanks to a great acting by the hand of Brendan Frasier, the movie finally lead to a kind comedy/action sequel. This third part failed also as a comedy film. It has a lot of Chinese stuff and no real mummies, abuses of special effects, mixes thousand-year-old Chinese mysticism and kung-fu or something with brute guns and fighting skills. In a brand new movie that could lead to some fine action scenes, but on this occasion it is just not good enough. Not only it ruins the story but it also repeats it.

Interesting that I found the end credits animation good, is that because animation is the preferred medium regardless of story? I Love the mummy films, well the first one, but this one was thin, the action sequences too fast to get any real enjoyment, the music bombastic and the cleches extremely tiresome. Slow down, I say, focus on the plot lines, why move so fast? Make it more intelligent, give the story more to do. I wanted it too succeed, most of us do, but what makes a good adventure film succeed is better development of plot, more interesting development of characters; I mean what was the death of the ""new general"" and her scare face side kick all about, I didn't know them. The main problem with this film is it went too fast and was loaded with pathetic comedy - need I mention the yak. Take your time go slower that's the way to go, be gentle and if you have action, lets see it, not swollowed up in a blur to cover deficiencies. I enjoyed it but as whenever I'm disappointed, I wanted more, more time more careful attention to detail, does everything ave to be so cheaply cast away? come on guys you can do better than that, I see this as the producers problem, the financiers problem, you pushed the artistry too much, you cut it down too simply, you made way for greater spectacle and sacrificed a good film.

The young lady who plays Lin (Isabella Leong) is simply... stunning. What a beauty!So I'd suggest to viewers not to waste so much effort pointing out the rather obvious weaknesses, or the fact that the Mandarin is poorly spoken (I, for one, can't tell the difference anyway! ;-}).

The one drastic change was the obvious shift from Egypt to China. Second, a young all American cast had been assembled and the fact that sommers had not returned. Throughout the film, I found my self staring in disbelief at how bad this film was as compared to the first two. There were more sex jokes than the last, the various monsters were stupid (I get the whole ""turn into a dragon thing, but how do you turn into something that looks like it crawled out of where the wild things are?) Also, the film completely changed Rick O'Connell. In the first two, he was darker, mysterious and still bad ass. In this film, he is arrogant, joking and playful. However, on a more positive note, the film did have some pretty solid action scenes (Defending the gateway scene is by far the coolest gun fight i've seen)and the SFX were amazing. The score, which was amazing in the first two, was completely lackluster. It made the film playful when at times it should have been darker. Overall Consensus: The Mummy: Tomb of The Dragon Emperor is an entertaining romp that shows that you shouldn't change the formula that worked earlier in the series. Combined with awesome action sequences, amazing effects, also bringing in an annoying score and unneeded sex jokes, the film will only entertain you one time only.

Maybe she wasn't available or she wanted more money or she just didn't want to do it... who knows, but it took me about 30-45 mins to get over it and just accept that Maria Bello is now Evelyn O’Connell, I felt she grew in to the role and in the end thought she did a very good job. I think if people watch it a second time, they will be even more comfortable with her role. Secondly I think way to many people are being harsh on this film, for either not having Rachel Weisz or because it's a bit like the previous ones. It's a good movie on it's own and although I too, felt early on, that this wasn't going to be what I'd hoped for, but I was able to get over it and enjoy the film for being a good action, fun, thrilling and entertaining movie that it was.

Its the same story as the previous ones and most of the stuff in the movie were taken from them as well. I love Brendan Fraser but he didn't look happy to be there and with how the story was set up, you can't blame him for looking miserable. He has no chemistry with Maria Bello, who was just awful (She's no Rachel Weisz, that's for damn sure.) and he has even less chemistry with his own son played by Luke Ford, who has the charisma and the charm of a brick, not to mention the fact that he looks just as old as both Fraser and Bello. Fraser has more chemistry with John Hannah, who is a welcome distraction from the lousiness of the film. The movie itself is just a flat headed mess of bad visual effects with no soul. Jet Li lacks the menacing presence of Arnold Vosloo from the previous films but that problem is more than less on the shoulders of the director, who was in my opinion more concern with the style of the film than any substance it could have had and because of that, Jet Li and most of the cast got the short end of the stick and it shows.They should have ended it with the second film but instead, we have a movie that manages to make even ""The Scorpion King"" look as good as Iron Man.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

I also think people were turned off because it's a ""mummy"" movie and yet it takes place in China. OK so the villain really isn't a ""mummy"" (and wrapped and buried) but he still has the same traits as Imhotep; banished from his lifetime with a curse and awaits to when he is resurrected again to concur the world. And what's even better is that it's not the same story line. The Mummy Returns (2001) was almost like a retread because it was the same story from The Mummy (1999), except this time it included the Scorpion King.

367,psugirle,A Review from a True Mummy Fan,3,22 June 2014,"I am a huge Mummy fan. The first two movies are among my top 5 all time favorite movies. This third one is just TERRIBLE. I can stomach through the whole movie because of two reasons: 1) Brendan Fraser & 2) John Hannah. That seems to be the only thing that works with this movie. Here is why this movie should have never been produced.1) No Rachel Weisz-- I understand the show must go on when a actor chooses not to reprise their role; however, I am sorry they got it wrong with Maria Bello. There was no chemistry with her and Brendan. If Rachel chose to not come back because of the script (1 of the 2 reasons that were speculated--other was b/c she just had her child) I don't blame her--the script was awful.2) Let's talk about the script & chemistry. If you are a fan of the first two mummies, the great thing about the movies were how the chemistry flowed when they weren't even a ""couple"" in the 1st movie until the end, and even as their love progressed in the 2nd film. To start off the film that these two seem to ""struggle"" because they lack another mummy adventure was very unlike the characters that were developed previously in both movies. I felt like we were questioning the character of these two when from the previous movies you never once questioned who or what they were about. Even in the 2nd movie opening before the ""mummy"" comes back you can feel the chemistry and the passion that drove the both of them that you remember from the 1st. I understand years and years have gone by (with no mummies to fight) but to believe they sit around all day like they belong in a mental ward was just poor writing.Hats off to Brendan for carrying this movie--but even the development of his character and the lines they gave him were just terrible. I mean--he is this gun blazing, fearless, tough ""macho-man"" who tackles anything and everything in the 1st two, and now fumbles with a fish hook and appears to be nothing like the hero we fell in love. In the Mummy Returns there wasn't anything he wouldn't have done for Alex, and the way they wrote the relationship for this entire family just seemed like it was a broken family to begin with.3) Alex's age? I don't blame Rachel for not wanting to come back to a movie where Alex is in his 20's. How can you explain that when mom and dad don't even look like they have aged. Really doesn't make the film seem believable. I would have either not included him or only incorporated him with a smaller role. I loved Luke Ford as an actor, and I wouldn't take anything away from him--just a little unbelievable on the age for this movie.I just was so sadden by this movie. Maybe I am a fan that just couldn't get over Rachel Weisz not coming back (all be it, the chemistry would have at least been there) but the script was still just terrible. I know they are going to make a 4th movie and from what I hear none of the original cast will be back. My advice??? Don't do it unless you have Brendan, Rachel, and John as well as top notch writers.Oh well, at least I can watch ""The Mummy"" & ""The Mummy Returns"" with joy and pretend this one never happened.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
368,Blueynoes,They didn't...,1,6 December 2008,"Being a huge fan of the original Mummy film, and even loving the second, I was looking forward to this. It had a rating on IMDb that was far lower than the other 2, but hey, it's The Mummy! How bad can it be? The first 5 minutes of the film already had me sitting there shocked and praying for improvement. You get an introduction to the story behind a Chinese mummy that lasts way too long and is filled with needless scenes, and ends with the Chinese Emperor turning into chocolate (yes, chocolate) in a ridiculous CGI scene. I assume it was meant to look like mud, but no, really, it's chocolate.Past the awful introduction, we are introduced to the new Evey, who manages to disappoint us as the replacer of Weisz in the first 3 seconds, and the son of the 2 heroes, who has managed to age 20 years in the time his parents aged 20 minutes. The son, played by Luke Ford, discovers the Tomb of the Dragon Emperor. Everything ends up going wrong as expected, and soon enough he is joined by his parents and together they try and stop the new mummy threat.And that, is where everything goes downhill even further. Forget the suspense and action of the first movie. The Mummy itself is CGI for the biggest part of the movie. The chase scenes, the fights scenes, everything is CGI. And bad CGI at that. Every scene feels like a pointless filler they had to put in so the movie lasted long enough to show at the theaters. It's all laughably bad. We see a CGI mummy with wooden animations attack the heroes with CGI fireballs that look nothing like fireballs, and we actually see CGI Yetis commanded by a Japanese woman. That's right. A Japanese chick shouting orders to a Yeti.I don't know where it went wrong. It could be the emperor turning into chocolate, the mummified army of the emperor looking like toys, the decision to have yetis commanded by a Japanese girl, replacing Jet Li with a tin-can CGI emperor, or Brendan Fraser jumping away from something that is supposed to resemble a blast of fire while uttering the same 'AAH' that Rachel Weisz uttered when she read the script, but it went wrong.This movie is really, really bad. Stay away, far far away. I don't know how it managed to score more than a 5 on IMDb, but it is so not worth it. I watched through John Travolta's Battlefield Earth, and it was more fun than this. I thank Rachel Weisz for turning it down, but I hate that Brendan Fraser signed up for it. Had he turned it down as well, maybe the script would've been rewritten. As it stands, this movie is nothing but a cash-in.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
369,vahid_99,Great action flick...,8,11 August 2008,"I see the other commentaries are not so great, but to be truthful I don't know why. The movie seems to take off from the beginning and it never slows down. I didn't notice if the acting was good or bad, I guess because I was just to engrossed in the action. Others can pooh-pooh it if they want to be stuck-up, I thought it was a great popcorn munching action flick.Some people just don't know that the point of some movies is to have a good time.I especially enjoyed how Chinese legend and history was woven into the story. The yeti were a great touch, too, if not for the trailers I wouldn't have expected them.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
370,ken_wilsonii,"Fun Movie, don't blame the actress, blame the writers",7,5 August 2008,"Some of the dialogue was..well terrible. The 2 writers on this are not know any great capability when it comes to story telling and the director should be held accountable for not either firing them or holding them accountable for the bad dialogue and making them re-write the dialogue for the scenesSome background scene music was a uhh..a little questionable. A monkey could have picked better music. Not sure who's decision it was on the music here but it seemed out of place. Classis music mistakes in movie history ""Legend"". Some idiot though the American audiences needed something more poppish and put tangerine dreams music in and took out the full classically written piece by Jerry Godlsmith. Entirely different movie with the Original score (they released it with original score on DVD, I own it.)I liked the new actress just fine and had no problems with here in the role. The guy who played the son was terrible though..back to acting classes. In fact though both you main actors needed help in the acting category.Movie also seemed like it was cut down for time, felt like we missed a few thingsDespite all that the movie was pretty good. Strong plot, Visual effect were great, action sequences were exceptional.Get better writers and kick these 2 to the curb. Oh, their names...by Alfred Gough and Miles MillarAnd another director if he can't recognize bad dialogue. His name Rob Cohen",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
371,godblessit2001,Cliché. No! Bad? Yeah...,6,31 July 2008,"Well I came expecting this part of the mummy to bomb due to the fact that the old cast has been almost entirely replaced. And really, the second part in my honest opinion already gave me an idea that this was going to be only a CGI action packed movie with no plot.But...To my surprise it really had some more depth than the previous sequel which had only chewed on the first plot of the movie as much as possible. The romance from the first original movie came into play and the action scenes and chases were bearable to watch. And although I was displeased with the chemistry between Fraser and Bello I noticed that it didn't matter because they're supposed to be older. They're love hasn't died it's just gotten to the point where their friendship has taken over more, their passion has faded a bit.Now I'll talk about what I didn't like.Well of course we have a movie that consists a lot about the flashback of how Jet's character became a mummy, which is very long. The CGI was so annoying to watch because you knew it wasn't going anywhere. (Undead vs undead and Childish yeti's.) Jet's character doesn't get good screen time either where he gets to show some hatred or fear towards the main characters. Perhaps because of the fact that the previous mummy did in the first 2 sequels, which of course might have influenced my judgement. The dialog for the actors were pretty silly at times, specially those of John Hannah's which were really redundant.Why do I give it a six?Well there are so many movies that really do only Clichés 24/7 and rip off lines from other movies, this one however tries not to. And I've only knit picked some mistakes but the others I don't mind because they're above the standards of what I expected from it. This however isn't a worthy sequel just like the 2nd and I'll give the 6 for adding romance that I found equally as good as the first movie.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
372,AmaZingen,Mummy fans beware!,2,31 July 2008,"Here I was in the theater, trying so hard to love this movie, trying to put aside all the bad articles, reviews and comments that I've heard and read; being a supportive ""fan"". Still I just couldn't do it. The movie IS BAD. How Bad? Let's start with the story. The story was okay, it didn't deliver a good, sarcastic script as before but it was OK. It had ""values""; if you want that. The screenplay was too comedic for me, sure there was action, it's Kung Fu, but there was too many bad jokes and almost cartoon moments... For the CGI, it was OK, if you give a crap about that.Now for the sole reason of why the movie sucked; the actors.The lost of Rachel Weisz, really messed this film up. Everyone was trying so hard, to retain that ""chemistry"" or that ambiance from the mummy series back; It was painful. Brendan seemed like he wanted to die in the movie. You can tell that Brendan wanted to smack Maria Bello's head off because she didn't portray Evy right. It was as if she puts on the wrong mask in every play. When the scene asks her to be funny or sarcastic, she's being too damn serious. She's so serious, she made Brendan look like a teenage boy, almost like a son. The way she looked at him wasn't loving, the way she talked to him wasn't either. There chemistry just didn't work. She made Evelyn look too old for Rick,like a grandma... or something. Brendan Fraser and John Hannah still portrayed there characters right. (As they should, they were the original.) I know they did it right, still it looked so wrong. I think they did it too well, they looked like goofs. I mean this in a bad way, I know Jonathan is a real goof but Rick? putting ice on yourself is too much,It was like watching Brendan Fraser in George of the Jungle and Looney tunes back in action, which is not appropriate for this film. Oh, how I wish that I did not convince myself to watch this film. I feel sorry for Maria Bello too.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
373,Nesslad,Slow to start but gets going fast,9,21 August 2008,"This film was slow to start... Plus Maria Bello plays Evie nothing like Rachel Weisz did, (not funny and far to English)However if you bear with it this film turns out to be a epic movie with big action and war scenes. Brendan Fraser seems to be on fine form these last few years and it was nice to see his charm and humour come through so natural again. One major side flaw if you would... is John Hannah should have played his same annoying yet funny Johnathan like the first 2. His character seemed rushed and crammed into this film. But to sum it all up his is by far better than the second one and hopefully this has rebooted The Mummy franchise for at least one more film.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

Well the plot follows the same logic used in the previous movies,great action scenes,some funny parts,special effects are great and at least we don't have someone surviving to a nuclear bomb inside a refrigerator neither the writers of this movie confuse Peru(Incas)with Mayas(Guatemala),actually in this movie China is not Japan.China is China which means this team made a good research. My advice is that you must watch this movie,because it is very entertaining in all aspects.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
376,Skrilax_CZ,So promising ... :'(,5,1 August 2008,"I really liked the previous Mummy movies and was about to enjoy this one, but ....It has all the prerequisites of a good movie when you look at the teaser: strong story with mythology of ancient China; charismatic and truly evil villain with the face of Jet Li and our heroes back again with some new ones.The movie actually works well in its first third. We are introduced the Mummy and his back-story, reintroduced Rick, Evelyn, uncle John and Alex. This part of the movie is what it should be. It explains the heroes' problems, current situation and contains some nice jokes so and kicks us for the 'huting of the Mummy once again' very well. However then the disappointment comes: yes, we are kicked well, but for nothing. No thrill, no excitement and the only things that are good to watch is Rick and Alex comparing their arsenal and the romance between Lin and Alex. Emperor Han is simply boring here unlike Imhotep - he is not thankful for any hospitality (fans of The Mummy know what I refer to :) ), he just comes and tadydadydadydyda. Just like he would not be Li anymore and somebody different. And what is worse, the plot becomes completely predictable here. You are *TRULY* waiting for the final battle, there really is no thrill here. Hopefully it is at least worth it. Jet Li and Brendan Fraser saves the day making a good fight in the finale.This is such a waste of strong back-story and an a main villain. And Maria Bello as Evelyn is completely giving her worst performance - it just gives you the feeling: ""Oh, shut it, for god sake!"". Uncle John could be given more importance and less foolishness. At least Alex and Lin are comforting, they fit exactly to their role. If you are able to survive the lack of the thrill in the movie, you can give it a chance. Otherwise don't at all. Such a pity that this series is probably definitely buried.China deserves more than this non-thrilling Thriller. 5/10",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
377,spiritaway,Jet Li is sorely underutilized,6,25 August 2008,"The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor Once again, we go to the lives of the O' Connell family, but this time, Alex has grown up (AS IN) but it's like Rick and Evie didn't age. Of course, Evie has become a bit less beautiful because it's not Rachel Weisz reprising the role anymore, but Mario Bello. But except Evie, the gang's all here.Alex skips school and goes to China to try to find the Dragon Emperor who was cursed by a witch (Michelle Yeoh). His army was cursed with him, and now, of course, he has resurrected from the dead because of a Chinese general who thinks the ideals of freedom are not ideal for the world.Jet Li's character's mission is now to go to the immortality water thingy that Michelle Yeoh's character is protecting, and release himself from his crummy CGI exoskeleton and revive his army.Of course, the O' Connells are the reason of his living, and now they're trying to stop him. As usual.Basically, the movie is just going through the paces. The proceedings have become predictable, the humor even more stale. The special effects? Ha! Don't start with me about the special effects! Now, judging for the poster, you'd think at least that the effects of this installment is for 2008, but in the movie? Not really. There are some tolerable, still believable effects, but the others aren't. The army in the war scene? Total unbelievability. Jet Li's eventual defeat? Laughable. These effects would've been more believable 5 years ago, but nope, they're iffy in today's standards, to say the least.Anyway, the two parents are hypocrites. In Returns, they said they love Alex, but here, it's like they ignored him anyway. Alex is a downright ass, and I hate him. And his love story? Bah. There's no emotion in it whatsoever, and the relationship, even though I'm not saying that cross-racial relationships are bad, is really awkward. And come on! The logic! Movie language usually states that if you are stripped of your immortality, your age will catch up with you. Here, it's different. But hey, I could always make this point a point that's going for the movie: it doesn't follow movie convention in only this aspect! (sarcasm) It's actually a good thing that Rachel Weisz backed out of this project, otherwise she'd succumb to my wrath. Still, if she were in this installment and she reprised her role as Evie O' Connell, maybe the movie would actually get its human emotion. Weisz is a good actress, so if she wants to make us believe that her character is truly, madly, still in love with Rick after all those years, she could. The movie could've been better with her, but she was better off without it in her resume.The twists are rudimentary and yawn-inducing, and Jet Li is sorely underutilized. What do you see of Jet Li in this movie? A CGI statue of him, that's what. If you wanted me to count his screen time in the flesh, it would probably be as brief as Chow Yun Fat's appearance as a Singaporean pirate in Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. They could've used his wushu prowess! But noooo, nothing to exploit his skill.""I hate mummies!,"" Rick says. Yeah, me too. But the mummies I hate are the movies. They all suck, but not Batman and Robin sucky but still.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
378,jim_lundquist,What a disappointment...,3,28 August 2008,"If IMDb says adventure in genre I probably watch most of them even going as low as 3 in rating cause I really like this kind of movies...After watching the other two mummy movies and finding them both quite good I was anxious when this, the third part finally came. This movie shouldn't have been made was my reaction after ten minutes of watching. What happened? I can't just pick out any specific reasons why it was bad... but it was... trust me! I just hope all mummies will be buried now, and that they STAY buried. I can only blame myself for watching this. It's usually always a bad sign when a director (in this case Sommers) make the first two movies and is replaced with another one in the third part. Even worse when one of the main actors/actresses Weisz is replaced with new Bello... These things may work in a soap opera running for 1000 or so episodes but in this case it's doomed to fail right when they started shooting the movie.And Brendan Fraser... what about him? He wasn't much of an actor in his previous movies but here it seems like he's doing a parody of himself in the earlier mummy movies. Maybe he thought he was doing ""George of the Jungle 2"" or something...If you like adventure/action there's so much else to see instead of this",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

380,cant_hardly_wait,Not As Good As The Others...,7,7 August 2008,"When I heard that a new Mummy movie was coming out I just couldn't contain myself! I was so happy - finally a chance to catch up with Rick and his family.So, the day it came out here in the U.K. I went straight to the cinema to watch it. The start was a bit slow, of course they do have to explain everything about what is happening with the Dragon Emperor. This was obvious seeing as it happened in the other two movies. Here for the first time we meet him played by the wonderful Jet Li.After you get past the explaining of the plot the movie starts to get so much better. Finally you see Brendan Fraser at his best! Not forgetting John Hannah who I simply adore! It is full of laughter, suspense and like both of the other Mummy movies a little bid of edge of the seat Oh my gosh I can't believe that just happened. Good Points: Brendan Fraser, John Hannah and Luke Ford really make this movie good. The surprise guests and little jokes are hilarious. And of course, who forget the famous Mummy of the movie! Jet Li makes an excellent Mummy!Bad Points: What were they thinking when they thought they could replace Rachel Weisz. No offence to Maria Bello but no one can replace her. Evie was made for her! There is no on screen chemistry between Maria and Brendan like there was with Rachel. There are certain special effects which make you cringe. Seeing as technology is so advanced.Overall I like this movie and am definitely going to buy it on DVD when it comes out. If your a mummy fan then this is perfect - if you are watching it because you want to see if its better than the others stay clear.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
381,wesa989,Jet Li had some spectacular battle scenes in Wardlords,6,18 August 2008,"Jet Li had some spectacular battle scenes in Warlords and fought like five sec in Mummy. Lol, I m totally speechless! ----------------------------- Not quite historical war epic or martial arts actioner, director Peter Chan's THE WARLORDS is a gritty anti-war film starring Jet Li, Andy Lau and Takeshi Kaneshiro that is inspired by Chang Cheh's 1973 kung fu classic THE BLOOD BROTHERS. It features pulse-pounding, semi-realistic battle action never before seen in a Chinese film, vivid imagery from one of China's most violent periods in history and a melancholy story with moments of gripping intensity in what is otherwise a routine saga of heroic bloodshed, brothers-in-arms and vengeance. In one of his best acting performances to date, Jet Li exudes a commanding presence as Pang Qing-yun, a Qing general who escapes the complete destruction of his army through an act of cowardice. After holing up with a peasant woman named Lian (Xu Jing-lei), he joins forces with a band of outlaws led by Zhao Er-hu (Andy Lau) and Jiang Wu-yang (Takeshi Kaneshiro). The trio forms a blood pact by slicing the throats of three luckless travelers. Pang convinces them to join the Qing army and becomes their commander as they begin a bloody five-year campaign to suppress a widespread rebellion. Jet Li seems to have found his stride with his character which is ironic considering he's better known for his screen fighting, unlike his co-stars. It's a complex character that can be seen as heroic and pitiful at the same time and Li strikes the right balance in his interpretation. It's a little difficult to tell what kind of film THE WARLORDS is trying to be. It's certainly not a martial arts movie like Chang's film despite Ching Siu-tung's choreography. Limited military-style fighting action is perhaps more realistic than we've yet seen in any Chinese film and is closer in style and maturity to Hollywood epics like BRAVEHEART and GETTYSBURG. Yet Ching is still unable to keep the action real enough for it to be taken seriously. In one scene Ching has Kaneshiro swinging around on a rope in a canyon fight eerily similar to a fight scene in THE BANQUET. Later, Li is seen slicing off the feet of half a dozen enemies in a single stroke during a pitched battle where he single-handedly wipes out a line of cannon. This latter scene is part of the film's 10-minute showpiece sequence where Li leads his army of 800 men against a superior force of 5000 armed with rifles and cannon. It's a great scene with Li in a one-against-many battle while wielding a guandao.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
382,nnjhbgv,Mindless Fun,8,6 August 2008,"All the excitement I was holding in for this movie was too much not to go see it. I was disappointed off the bat. Brendan Fraser and Jet Li was great together but I totally didn't like Maria Bello's performance. I couldn't help thinking that the original Evelyn O'Connell wouldn't act like that. Rachel Weiz was a hard person to replace in this movie. I now see why she didn't do the movie. Maria Bello made here seem ditzy or just plan dumb. Now, Luke Ford is an upcoming actor but I didn't like his performance neither or the chemistry that he had with Brendan Fraser. It was totally annoying and childish in a way. John Hannah was great as usual in his role as Jonathan, I did like his sense of humor in some of his parts.The action was great, but the plot could of been written a lot better. I watched it with horror what Maria Bello did to her character. She was a disappointment to the kids and me. On the other hand, Jet Li gave a good performance as usual and I always liked his movements in his films. Brendan Fraser seem to be distant from his character somehow, maybe with all that divorce and court battle must of took its toll on him after all. Well, I look forward to seeing him in G.I.

It seems to be like Marmite, you love it or you hate it. I loved it.Take away Maria Bello's incompetent performance as Evy and do your best to forget some awful dialogue and try to relax. Underneath the brash exterior there is an enjoyable element of fun to this film. It's not slow paced, it's not too over the top, but it's a popcorn flick and if everyone could get rid of ""critic"" in them, maybe they might be able to enjoy the movie for what it is.Which is a fun and light hearted adventure.It does lack the Horror element which was present in the first, and the witty banter has been considerably reduced. Blame the writers and Rob Cohen, for he is definitely no Stephen Sommers and that is clear from the beginning.Like Pirates of the Caribbean, X-Men and Spiderman, the trilogy has become more depleted with every outing, i would still pay to see a fourth.Scratch the writers and Rob Cohen is what i say.But yeah, i loved the film and it at least deserves you to give it a chance, especially if you are fans of the series.It did a lot more for me than Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Dull did thats for sure!",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
385,schock-4,The right way to watch this film,4,6 August 2008,"Just got back from the cinema after seeing this movie. Yeah OK, I was warned, and it was crap, BUT I can say more than that about it.First of all, I do recommend seeing this movie sometime, but I recommend seeing it in a very specific way. Rent it, watch it on a projection or other large screen (No sweeping cinematic photography a la Dances With Wolves, but more than just talking heads.), evoke the Chinese god of silence, Mu-ting, and turn on your favorite music (something that goes with an action movie though). I'm not being ironic here. I really do think it makes really good eye candy, but the dialogues are painfully bad. In this respect, it's several times worse than the other Mummy movies, which is not a very high bar in the first place.Mostly because of the awful dialogues, in my opinion, the actors are just not superhuman enough to pull them off in any redeemable fashion, with ONE exception. I wouldn't ask anybody to pay such close attention to the movie to sit there with the remote poised, but if they/you did, un-mute for any and every scene in which Michelle Yeoh speaks. Seriously, it takes superhuman acting talent to pull off anything in this movie, and she actually does it. Amazing.Anyway, Jet Li, while not bad, is underused and, frankly, just doesn't make a good villain, in my opinion. Not sure why, maybe it's his boyish appearance. Anyway, I felt the film would have benefited from a bit more of actual Jet Li and a bit less CGI effects of his character.Brendan Fraser and John Hannah reprise their respective roles pretty much on par with the previous movies, which is OK in my opinion. Pretty much hated all the other actors they cast for this, especially the young Chinese woman, Isabella Leong, Very annoying voice. But the muting should take care of that problem. Maria Bello does a really awful job filling the shoes left by Rachel Weisz too.That's all I can think to say, but I think it's enough.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

With some very imaginative characters and a good overall idea this is well worth seeing especially if you're a fan of the first two. Granted it has its faults, for example, sometimes the acting is cheesy and it is a bit over-scripted. It also has some very camp moments and the characters lack any true emotional depth. But, all-in-all a pretty ""ok"" film. Brendan Fraser play the part of Rick O'Connel with an simple yet fun approach. They also manage to get the balance between stupidity and fun just about right. Maria Bello on the other hand was not well cast and she plays a very over protective and rather annoying Evy.

They had all seen the other mummy movies, one friend said it was a lot like the second one but is much more awesome!

I don't see what you nay-sayers are on about, I mean, don't get me wrong.. personally I hate Brandon Fraiser but this movie was great! I will admit there are some reused plot devices from Indian Jones but who cares? The movie was very entertaining. There were a few scenes with what you might call ""gore"" but honestly they weren't that bad... when they entered the tomb I thought the acid trap was the worst of the ""gore"" scenes.. the emperor was clearly animated so that wasn't too bad if you ask me. I want to see this movie again and again, don't listen to all the nay-sayers if you like a good story, because this movie has one!

388,decaan,crap beyond recognition,1,30 November 2008,"I absolutely loved the mummy and the mummy returns. And this movie doesn't does justice. First of all the development of characters is confrontational, it isn't clear who is supposed to be the main character and who is supposed to support, rick seems to be competing with his son during the whole film, which becomes an old family tragedy, of son vying for his sons approval. But wait this is supposed to be a movie about a mummy. One of these old archaic globalist, who want to rule the world. and luckily our proved cast....oh no they replaced Rachel, a class actress, with some zero dimensional uninspiring person. I wanted to be rick o Connelly after seeing the first movie, and I fell in love with Evy, who in my opinion was the perfect love. In this movie I admire no one, and feel cold to all characters. it is all about the script which is a sequences of uninspired action shots. the story is copied from the mummy. we have a group of slots, who aren't that scary as one, who want to revive an ancient evil, who of course will conquer the world once awaken. Luckely this secret is guarded by an ancient society, this time consisting of one person, instead of the impressive Mejia. the mummy is awakened, the combat is done, really quickly and uninspiring, the sacrifice is made. But all is well that ends well. Only a couple of setbacks: 1 no chemistry between the actors. 2.no comprehensive plot, to many different side stories. 2.though the mummy seem to be the main plot, Hollywood needs to spin the standard 1,2,3, where the romance between rick and envy was a simmering side plot of the mummy 1, it only took a small percentage of the storyline. in this movie, Alex who will stick it in anything, suddenly has a undying love for 2000 year old ling. and 2. well this movie sucks, I hate to say it, i really was looking forward to it. and the sad thing is that this is a blemish on the series.so it almost can't get better next time.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
389,biscuits090,Keep this film buried!,4,6 August 2008,"""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"", a movie seven years in the making, is Hollywood's failed attempt at a summer blockbuster. I don't usually write reviews for movies, but I feel I need to let moviegoers know what they are getting in to.1. Most of the jokes fall flat. The funniest part of the movie comes from a CGI skeleton.2. The Chinese spoken in the film sounds like a group of high school students reading aloud in class.3. A lot of the family dynamic seen in the second Mummy is noticeably absent, and although I personally enjoy Maria Bello, she was no Rachel Weisz (which I feel hurt the film significantly).4. ""You speak Yetti?"" Yes. Yetis appear out of nowhere in this film.5. The computer graphics in the movie look painfully cheap compared to other current films. This proved to be more of a distraction than a film aid.6. There are action-packed fight scenes, but nothing we have not seen before.7. The dialogue in this movie was so poorly written, you almost feel embarrassed for the writers.8. A lot of set up was given for certain characters with no follow through. They would show up in the beginning only to be forgotten about until the end of the movie.This film was a major disappointment. The potential this movie had was apparent, but never accomplished it. The locations and the costumes were amazing, and are the redeeming qualities of the movie (that, and the fact that everything is gratuitously blown up!!!).If you enjoy(ed) the Mummy series this movie will most likely be a letdown. If you want to be mildly entertained for a couple hours, then go see it at the matinée price. If you want to see a great movie, go see ""The Dark Knight.""",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
390,solarsam_7,Massive disappointment,2,27 December 2008,"When I first heard this movie was coming out, I couldn't wait. I loved the previous 2 mummy films, they had great action, humour and scenery. So when I went to see this I was expecting a new twist on the story due to the fact it took place in China and I was keen to see whether Maria Bello could do a performance worthy of the previous 2 films. But wow what a disappointment the film is. I don't mind sequels at all, but one thing that in my opinion should stay the same are the actors. As soon as this film starts, you can see why. Jet Li attempts to mimic Arnold Vosloo as the big villain but fails. The pilot guy was a stupid copy of the guy in mummy 2 who was hilarious. Brendan Fraser looks bored but is still by far the best feature in the film. Then there is Maria Bello. Her performance was by far, the most annoying, worst impression of Rachel Weisz that was possible. Luke Ford does a good job as their son but why is he so old? Away from the actors, the best thing in the film are the effects. The story is a mix of mummy 1 and 2 put together e.g the big chase through the streets is a copy of mummy 2 and trying to reach the mountains before the mummy gets their is also a copy of mummy 2. The movie loses not only the originality that made the franchise good, it also loses its fun factor. The movie tried to be fun like the previous 2, but I just found it boring and unentertaining. The makers of this film tried to do something new, but they fail miserably. If they have another sequel, please let it be back in Egypt, let them bring back Arnold Vosloo and Rachel Weisz and let it be a fun action film, not like this rubbish.I give this film 2 stars for the only things I can think that are good.1) decent special effects 2) it ends",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
391,jamesgaos,Terrible.,3,6 August 2008,"the movie was bad enough to sting my eyes. 1. Rachel Weiz was not in it, what's a mummy movie with Rachel!??? 2. Imhotep was not in it, he makes the mummy called the mummy! the monster in this film is not a mummy but a stupid Chinese warlord risen from his grave. the acting was corny, the jokes weren't funny anymore, but pure annoying. the storyline doesn't a make a lick of sense, and the new replacement for evy just doesn't have the spirit that rachel has to a mummy film. ut most of all (just like in rush hour 3) it lacks the adventure and 'power' in the previous mummy movies, which were very good. overall, this movie is basically horrible. my rating is 3/10.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
392,brad-mills,I fell asleep... this movie was absolutely terrible.,1,4 August 2008,"Like many of you out there I was a HUGE fan of The Mummy series but this one left a bitter taste in my mouth...The CGI graphics were horrible... in one scene the CGI graphics look cartoony kinda like ""who framed roger rabbit"", its 2008, this movie could've been made in the nineties. On top of the graphics being god awful the dialogue was so horrible, that I actually fell asleep... you probably remember the cute jokes and puns from the first two movies... yeah they tried to do that in this movie but it didn't work... plus there was no chemistry between the actors. The Cinematography was not as good as the first two... Honestly the list goes on with the horrible features of this movie... Perhaps if you haven't seen how good the first two mummies were than you'd like this movie, but i still doubt it... i would at least wait until it came out on DVD.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

I have been a huge fan of the series, but don't kid yourself this movie is an embarrassment to all movies everywhere not just the Mummy Series. Everything possible was wrong with this movie, all the on-screen chemistry from the previous movies is thrown out the window. As Brenden Fraser's character aged 2 days and his wife over-went make yourself less attractive surgery(or re-casted whichever one), someone decided to let the son age 20+ years for this movie and recast a horrible actor. There honestly was nothing good about this movie except for when it ended. Due to Horrible recasting of roles, Bad Acting, Zero on screen chemistry, Horrid Dialog, and over all Bad, Bad, Bad, I would gice this movie a 0/10 since negative scores aren't possible. Brenden Fraser and Jet Li should have just said No! Get a front-end lobotomy and mummify yourself before watching this movie by choice. -3van",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
394,Che_1983,Another add-on to my worst movie list,1,22 August 2008,"The movie is junk from the first 20 minutes till the end. The idea of the movie was great, the acting was normal, but the movie in it's entire form was some kind of junk.The Qin dynasty was the greatest one and then a few Americans came along acting with the purpose to trying to save the world?common, there is a script and there are awful scripts, all the ""bad guys"" were acting dumb and just walking around so the ""good guys"" can crush them. Duuude!And then there is the dragon form of the emperor, At least get that on right and turn him into a Chinese dragon and not a pathetic middle aged western three-headed one. It sucks and what's with the excessive use of English, it's like the dead people could understand English.The movie can have some imagination, but at least think it through and at least make the ""bad guys"" more intelligent.I registered especially for this low rated movie and I rest my case: It completes my theory that the first one is always the greatest, sequels suck, most of the time.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
395,nieltaylor,shame really,2,25 August 2008,"I've gotta say I had really low expectations going to see this but seeing as I had a soft spot for this series I didn't mind giving it the benefit of the doubt. I write this for anyone else who got enjoyment from the first two and even the scorpion king, pretend this doesn't exist, I and many others have made the sacrifice so you don't have to.I'm not gonna slag the cast off, it's not their fault. They are all wasted talents here. It's the script, you can get away with a story like this no problem with an audience looking for escapism, but you cannot write such inept, brain lobotomising dialogue and expect people to buy in in any way. It's actually pretty insulting, not to mention boring. That's the annoying thing, story wise it isn't a stones throw from the first two and the action is a bit flat but its not badly staged, so it's down to an incredibly childish, fun sucking leech of a script. And it's not like the other films had brilliant scripts either, so wow, big problems here.It's technically well made and lots of stuff goes bang, but exciting it isn't and it really feels like a forced, soulless cash in that probably wouldn't have been made if not for Indy's reappearance this year. Not even a guilty pleasure. (I thought Stealth was a guilty pleasure and we know how badly that was received, so I didn't really think this could be as bad as all that since it is by the same director.......WRONG!!!)",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
396,msylynn1,The Mummy 3? Yuck!,4,30 August 2008,"I love Brendan and Jet. I loved Mummy 1 and 2. This third one stinks. I missed Rachel. There replacement, sorry I forgot her name, didn't have the same chemistry with Brendan so I could care less. I guess everyone has to get older, but I did not enjoy how he was asleep when she was trying to be sexy. No no no. Brendan must be the ultimate hero, not some dumpy old guy! And how come his son went from having a strong British accent to having an American one? I was distracted by that the whole time. Hated it.The humor was forced and the whole movie was pointless. Don't see it. Enjoy the first two over and over, and pretend the third was never made.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
397,frannyscott,Dull,4,30 December 2008,"The primary mummy film was a great spectacle providing audiences with a surprising dose of action with a brilliant edge of wit to it, all tied together with a clever plot. The sequel was no different, but in many ways this was the problem - same old characters, same villain, and the storyline was so close to the other, that after watching both films it becomes nearly impossible to decipher witch scene goes with witch film... the mummy, it seemed, had become finally extinct. This new take on the idea had a good chance of re-incarnating the old mummy anew; though in this case a new plot, new characters and a new villain are present. This film had all the right ingredients, but unfortunately they are jumbled up in what ends up being a slow-paced, unwitty production. There is never, for instance, the sense of fear and excitement that its predecessors manipulated excellently. The film then fails to conjure up any of the old wit that became a main symbol of the old films. This film has just about wiped away any chance for a rival of what could have been one the most memorable film series of our era.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
398,dark-riddler,Disappointing /:,2,22 April 2012,"The previous comment/review describes everything wrong with it so you may watch it but if you're a fan (and even if you are not), most likely you will dislike this title.(I love The Mummy and The Mummy Returns and I've watched both countless times until this day. So I was quite looking forward for this 3rd film. Even after knowing that dear Rachel Weisz wouldn't be on it, I gave it a chance.... I did fell asleep about 30-40 minutes before the end, though. It was dreadful boredom! x.x It seemed to be a movie just made to attract money and nothing more, with a great cast but poor storyline, execution, dialog, fighting scenes, even the sense of humor sucked. It cannot be, ever, a good movie and it's far from the quality the previous titles have. Sorry.)",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
399,gjaensch,A laugh and a half,2,12 October 2008,"I love the first two mummy movies. They are funny, full of action and a cool storyline to boot. When my boyfriend said he was taking me to see the third i was so excited. That quickly turn to disappointment within the first 10 minutes of this film. Why did they ruin the mummy franchise with this film? Although one of the worst screw-ups in this film is not getting Rachel Wiesz to do it, it is not the worst. The movie seemed dull and the acting (besides Brendan Fraiser & John Hannah)was almost laughable. It was all to put on. But the one thing I thought that Movie Producers knew by now was NOT to bring in new people to play old characters! What is they pulled someone in to take over Harrison Ford's role in Indiana Jones?!? Urgh best not to think about it.If you want to waste your money go see this movie. And the next time I go out, i'm picking the film :)",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
400,thedruidess81,Uh...I'm so disappointed,4,16 November 2008,"Firstly, as soon as I saw Eevy wasn't played by Rachel Weisz in this one, I about flipped. This new chick and Frasier have, like, ZERO chemistry. Sometimes it's better to let a good thing die , than ruin it with a crappy sequel.That said, some quality actors got involved with this piece of junk. What a shame! Michelle Yeoh, Jet Li, not to mention Frasier and Hannah. I still wish to god Weisz had agreed to stay on as Eevy. And does anybody else notice their kid ages at an alarming rate? Or do they just use really good cold cream, cuz Rick and Evelyn look darn good for their ages, considering the first movie took place in the early 20's and this movie supposedly takes place in or around 1947. And, again with the chemistry thing...no father/son chemistry. In the Mummy II Alex idolized his father. The sudden turnaround was irritating. And Alex's very fast crush on the chick who tried to kill him? Puh-lease. Yes, that's how bad it is. I said ""Puh-lease""The only saving grace are the charming Yetis. I want one. They're so cute... And faithful protectors too.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
401,TaladarkieJJ,Could have done without third movie,2,17 November 2008,"I've always been a fan of the Mummy movies & Egypt was such a nice setting. Mummies & Egypt, very logical, right? Interesting story, good special effects, great characters (I especially loved Arnold Vosloo as Imhotep. He made a great mummy! & did he ever look hot in that loincloth!) So, I was actually looking forward to seeing this third installment. I had checked out some earlier reviews and well, after seeing how bad they were I almost didn't want to go but because i'm such a fan, I did go & regretted it immensely. It sucked big time. The effects were okay, but the story line? What the hell? I never liked the whole China thing to begin with but I stayed optimistic until I saw the movie. As soon as I did my world came crushing down. Jet Li wasn't that bad as a villain, still Arnold Vosloo was much better. The fight between O'Connell and the Dragon Emperor should have lasted longer. & what was up with that army that they summoned to fight on their side? Those were a bunch of retarded mummies with only one arm or leg. It was laughable. Or was that their goal? I also found it truly sad that Rachel Weisz didn't want to return for this third part, but after seeing the movie, I can't really blame her. You made the right choice Rachel! Anyway, I want to forget all about it & pretend it never happened. It's easy to forget anyway. It totally bored me.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
402,secondhandrose-1,"Not that bad, not amazingly good.",7,3 December 2008,"I wasn't expecting a great deal from this film, as a big fan of the first two Mummy films I knew it wouldn't be as good.With two of my favourite stars (Brendan Fraser, Michelle Yeoh) I knew they would entertain me, and they did. Although unsurprisingly the other main actors (Luke Ford, Mario Bello) didn't pull off anything remarkable, and to me, they didn't seem like the right people for an action movie.The plot was simple to follow, perhaps a little too empty, but still it wasn't completely pointless. I was interested to know what happened, and entertained throughout (apart from a few dodgy moments at the start, I suppose thats retired life!). No boring long speeches, declarations of love or hate just good ol' guns blaring and ancient sword slashing.It was great to see Rick back in action, with some laughs on the way (especially because of the greatly appreciated return of Eveys brother Jonathan (John Hannah) ). I was disappointed Rachel Weisz didn't reprise her role as Evelyn, as I didn't feel the same chemistry between Brendan and Maria as he had with Rachel.I was contented with this film, and do hope they make a fourth, as my expectations will be higher. For a mummy film without Egypt or mummies, it did pretty well in my books! Just don't go expecting a movie as great as the first two.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
403,sue-thomas21,Shameful!,2,20 June 2010,"This film is difficult to watch, because Maria Bello's terrible accent and acting grate on you so much. She just simply is NOT Evie. Rachel Weisz was never going to be easy to replace and it should probably not have been attempted. The on-screen chemistry between Weisz and Fraser was one of the best things about the first 2 films. Bello cannot fill her shoes. Whoever cast her should be shot! Unfortunately, I find the son a bit annoying too - it seems like his character is being moulded into a big, bouncing puppy version of Brendan Fraser - and he seems to have inexplicably turned into a ""true blue"" American...Weird. However, I think the Yetis are great -definitely the best characters in the whole film. :-D",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
404,poeticallity,Horrible,1,18 March 2009,"This movie was terrible. It took a good series of flicks, and blundered horribly. The replacement Evy, couldn't act her way out of a wet paper sack, and her accent was over done. Having traveled to the UK multiple times, it makes me sick to hear her speak. She is no Rachel Weisse I wanted to become a mummy myself watching it. There is foreshadowing, and then there is just common sense. The writer of this could have very well been in their freshman year of HIGH SCHOOL. Once again Hollywood has produced a CGI filled film with no substance, stupid one liners, and ruined what could have been done superbly. The direction itself is deplorable... I am now dumber for watching this.Where was the true struggle? Where was the character development. People in Hollywood blame downloading for the loss in sales at the box office. Well, we haven't had a Titanic or anything of that nature in years.I give this 2 thumbs way down....~Disappointed and disgusted",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
405,jacko_p28,Awful. A joke.,1,23 August 2008,"Absolutely awful. I am a big fan of the first two Mummy movies and this one was an embarrassment to the series.First of all, why does Alex have an American accent when he's English? I don't remember it being mentioned that he lived in America at any point after The Mummy Returns. Bad continuity.And very bad casting of Maria Bello as Evie, did anyone else notice how many times she went into an American accent when it was supposed to be English? (Which was awful by the way). Missed Rachel Weisz a lot here, she did well to stay away from this stinker of a project though.Worst thing of the entire movie though was the so called mummy. At what point were The Dragon Emperor's insides taken out and embalmed and his body wrapped in bandages? Hated the way he was able to shape shift into any creature he desired too.Abominable snowmen? Don't even go there.They should have risen Lord Imphotep to help them rid The Dragon Emperor and then cut his ass down again. I'd have been happy to see Arnold Vosloo back in a re-hash of The Mummy Returns than the piece of turd I sat watching last night.Best part of the movie? When I spilt Pepsi all over myself and was distracted from watching it for about 2 minutes as I took my jumper off and used tissues to dry myself off.This is one movie I won't be purchasing when it gets to DVD. Even AVP-R was better than this. TRASH!",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
406,courtwaddell,Third Mummy's Crummy,2,26 March 2010,"Lets get started. This movie was awful! I absolutely loved the first two, I've watched them at least a hundred times, but this... ugh! I couldn't even make it through the first half hour! (I did make it through the whole thing. But in pain) First off, What's up with Alex? In the second one, he's got a British accent and then in the third his accent disappears. How does that even work? Second, What is up with Evie? I couldn't stand Maria Bello as her. She was dreadful. Her British accent was terrible and seemed to change from scene to scene.As much as I loved the character Jonathan from the first two flicks, in this one he did very little but make wise crack jokes that were not funny at all.Brendan Fraser was decent as Rick, but the character lacked personality, all he did was beat up people and yell at his family.Sadly the funniest line of this movie was, ""She speaks yeti!?"" That tells you a lot about the script.And, what was up with Alex's ""Girlfriend?"" Was she even his girlfriend. Sadly their ""realtionship"" doesn't even really qualify as one. There was absloutely no build up on this particular plot line, which I would have like to see progress.I do not like the setting of this movie. The whole point of the first two was it was an Egyptian Mummy, not that I'm against Chinese mummies...but seriously. I mean. You couldn't leave it at two mummy movies? What happened to Ardeth Bay? Oh, You know Rick, the guy who helped you ALL through the first two? The action and graphics were decent if you are that kind of a movie fan.

Special effects way better than first 2 movies. I really liked the crystallized special effects, so cool.That's pretty much all I have to say but IMDb insists I write 10 lines. Oh well, Fraser's acting in this movie is preferable since he isn't yelling his head off at every sentence. I think he would be more enjoyable to watch if he just acted normal.The humour and one liners are slightly better than the previous movies. The zombie special effects were well done.Oh good, I can submit now. 10 lines, ridiculous! What's wrong with short and sweet.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

409,Lemeshianos,Where is Rachel Weisz?,4,8 September 2008,"Replacing Rachel really killed the movie. And replacing her with Maria Bello did things worse. She is nowhere near the looks of Rachel Weisz, the way she moves in actions scenes is awkward? and The dialogs/script make it worse, turning Evelyn O'Connell from an action girl into a housewife. This role just doesn't fit Maria Bello. You can just forget Evelyn as you knew her in the 2 previous movies.As for the rest of the movie, I felt like I was watching a movie I already saw. Cheese lines, repeated from other movies made this one really predictable. I was almost able to tell what the actors would say.We all know it is a fictional movie, but I think they overkilled it. A caught myself saying out loud ""You've got to be kidding me!"". Monsters, mummies and other creatures could have different reactions to bombs, but when a bomb lands right next to a human I expect not to see that guy in the rest of the movie. Too many scenes of skeletons walking around knocking each others head off by accident and then trying to walk around to find their heads... Could be funny at first, but when you see it 3-4 times it gets boring. CGI was obvious and awful. Really reminded me of some movies when CGI was introduced, or recent low budget movies.Taking all things into account, they made this movie to get money from the fame of the previous 2 movies. If it wasn't for Brendan Fraser's performance I would have rated this movie with a 3. I really hoped that the trilogy would close with decency but unfortunately it doesn't.

411,obi1007,I really wanted to like this film,4,3 May 2009,"What can I say? I really wanted to like this film. I'm a big fan of the previous 2 Mummy films (despite the awful visual effects of the Scorpion King). After seeing the trailer, I was somewhat shocked with some of the stuff I saw such as the Yeti sequence (and bad CGI at that) plus a number of other things but despite these, this is a Mummy film. How bad can it be? After dimming the lights, and pressing play on the DVD player, little did I know that I was sitting comfortable to watch a film that would completely destroy my loyalty to the Mummy series.The story was ridiculous, not to mention Maria Bello's acting. She is no Rachel Weisz by far. Some of the gags were wasted and for some reason, there are shots in the film that seem absolutely pointless.This film was made in the past year...so can someone please tell me WHY OH WHY the visual effects for this film were beyond terrible? The creature near the end of the film makes it look like it came out of Shrek and the Mummy never once made me feel scared, unlike Arnold Vosloo's ""Imhotep"".The chemistry between Rick and Evelyn seemed so distant, it was like forcing two strangers together. Perhaps this might be because we are so used to Rachel Weisz, that Maria is like a different person, literally! Throughout the film, I was finding myself trying to imagine how Rachel would have delivered her lines.John Hannah's character had plenty of jokes but in the midst of chaos, seemed unrealistic.To me, Luke Ford and John Hannah shone for me. Brendan's performance seemed to lack heart, though still entertaining. Jet Li seemed wasted and seemed to only be included for his martial arts.As for the ending, I'm not going to spoil it for people reading this, but the last thing Jonathan says (also the last piece of dialogue in the film) is deliberately contradicted immediately by a text graphic on screen which will obviously lead into a Mummy 4 (which is listed on IMDb). Rise of the Aztec? Not in Egypt, not a Mummy film personally.Following this discovery, I think it's the best interest of everyone, including the cast/crew's reputations, not to make this film UNLESS the story is gripping, set in Egypt, the Mummy is scary and Rachel Weisz is back. Only then will the filmmakers regain my loyalty to the series.I agree with previous comments - they should have left it at The Mummy Returns.This is a film I would rather have rented than purchased. If you want my advice, don't waste your money. As far as I'm concerned the Mummy series will only ever be the first two Mummy films.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
412,dh950,A horrible replacement for Rachel Weisz while she was pregnant.,3,17 December 2008,"The character, Evelyn Carnahan O'Connell made a decent blond haired zombie in this movie. Unfortunately, it's clear that was not her role. Maria Bello replaced the energetic Rachel Weisz due to Rachel Weisz being pregnant. I'm sure the movie would have been much, much better with Rachel Weisz playing the role, pregnant or not. I was surprised that Maria Bello had been in numerous other shows, but it appears that being an ACTION character was not her normal role. The action series Bello starred in, died a quick death. It probably did the same for this movie series. The main stars in this mummy movie series seemed to reinforce each other in the previous movies. Maria Bello seems to have been someone they unfortunately got stuck with, dragging them all down quite a bit. Even Jet Li seemed affected. Maybe they can recall this movie like a bad product and redo it with Rachel Weisz.I dozed off a few times during the movie. My teenage sons were disappointed with this movie. The movie ended with loud expression of happiness that it was over, and a long list of derogatory comments, including a few that they got told to watch their language.If they do make another of this series of movies, which the end of the movie hinted at, it had better have the original main cast or I'm not even going to waste my time watching it, much less buying it. I'll be looking for the name, Maria Bello, in future movies, so I'll know it is probably ruined also. I'm glad IMDb lists the current movies & shows to avoid.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

Kid might have been good in something else, but not right for this role.There's some things that any objective minded person could've suggested for editing. But I really think the thing that bugged me the most was the ""son"" trying to act like a corn-fed James Bond or Indiana Jones, or even a Rick O'Connell. Might have been directing, script or just bad acting on his part.I like Brendan Fraser movies for the most part, and this could've been great. Just think a little more time editing, different (and younger) son, would've made a lot more buzz about this picture.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
414,coolkeoo,Terrible cash in by all involved.,1,17 July 2008,"I was able to see this film about a month ago in a preview screening and to put it in kind words, its terrible. Jet Li is about the only good thing about the film but he's hardly in it. Brendan Fraser was phoning in his performance and looked if he was waiting from a call from his agent to get him out of the movie. Maria Bello looked goofy and miscast and the actor who plays their son makes Hayden Christensen from the Star Wars films look like an Oscar winner. John Hannah manages to bring some laughs to the table but his stick is not as fresh as it was before and Michelle Yeoh does not really do much with her role. This movie lacks the creepiness of the first two Mummy movies and the stone warriors of this movie don't hold a candle to the ghouls of the first two films at all. Not to mention the fact that the visual effects in this film look even worse than the second film(The Mummy Returns). The film itself seemed toned down in the fun and thrills department and just feels tired in certain scenes not to mention the dialogue, which seems like it was written by a five year old. This film seemed like a quick payday from all involved and sadly with the little effort spent in giving the audience something to root for and care for, its just feels like no one even cared about what they were making.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
415,figureskating_junkie,Don't listen to the critics,8,6 August 2008,"I never pay attention to movie reviews. If a movie looks good or interesting, I will go see it. I happened to be watching ""The Daily 10"" on E! when Ben Lyons came on to give his critique of the movie. Basically, he said this movie was horrible and had no business being made. I had seen many bad reviews from know-it-all critics, but his seemed to be extremely harsh. I really wanted to see this movie but I really wasn't expecting much. This movie exceeded my expectations. I happen to love this movie. Lyons said he fell asleep during the movie. I don't know how that is possible because this movie was full of action. Of course, it had it's slow moments but they weren't long enough to bore me.I thought the acting was good. I felt sorry for Maria Bello because she was being judged on her performance before the movie even came out. With Rachel Weisz opting out of the movie with her inconsistent reasons(I want to get to that later), Bello rose up to the challenge. I thought she did a great job and she really turned Evie into her own instead of trying to copy Weisz. John Hannah is hilarious as usual and cute newcomer Luke Ford should look forward to a bright future in show business. Fraser was great once again as the adventurer. He even got more funny lines this time around which was nice to see because Fraser always makes me laugh. And contrary to what critics say, he still has what it takes as an actor.On to Weisz. I'm not really sure what her problem was. First, it was ""creative differences"", then it was because she didn't want to travel away from her daughter(which I can understand), but then she said it was because they were going to age her 10 years. Like most people, I thought it was weird that Alex would be 19 or 20 in the movie. It's really not hard to figure out how old Rick and Evie would be in this movie. In the movie, Rick says he was 23 when he was in the French Foreign Legion, which is where we found him in the first movie. The second movie happens 8-9 years later, which would make him 31 or 32. So in this movie, it would make him 41 or 42. Considering this movie was made 7 years after the second one, is it really that hard to add 3 years? Nearing 40, it's not hard to be convinced that Fraser and Weisz are around 41 or 42 in this movie. At that age, it really isn't too young to have a 20 year old son.Once I figured this all out(and yes, I thought about it), I wasn't so concerned. Also, if you don't know already, there are plans of making movies starring Ford, which also explains the sudden age jump. At 26, Ford might seem a little old to play Alex, but Hollywood has been casting older people and younger roles forever. For example, Fraser was 24 when ""School Ties"" was filmed and he was playing a high school senior! Please don't let the bad reviews and critics dissuade you from seeing this movie. Go see it if you want and have fun!",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
416,luvindamoments,Dumpster Fire,2,14 April 2019,"I had heard this movie was awful, so I put off watching it for a very long time because the first 2 are so dear to me. However, I finally decided to attempt to give it a fair shake. But it truly is awful.I get that Evy and Oconnel are supposed to be estranged but there is no inkling of chemistry or decent acting occurring from the new Evy and Fraser. Whoever was the casting director on this did a poor job.Especially when it came to recasting Alex. Enough time had past between the 2nd and 3rd where they could have gotten the same actor or another his same age. Instead of someone who was born 10 years early and does not have a young face. It is hard to believe the new Alex is young enough to be their child, especially Evy's. Also why does he not have a British accent? He did as a child and was raised in England.Then their is the story line. Disinteresting and all over the place.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
417,Vault_Tech,And there comes the magic of dubbing (and saved the movie),6,21 December 2008,"As I've read on here, many people disliked that movie a lot. Well, isn't a top movie for sure, but it has the few action scenes needed to be considered a nice action movie. ""The Mummy"" franchise, as other many titles (thankfully), I have seen it all in my language, and didn't had such problems in wasting my time about the ""wrong"" accents played by the actors or whatever...being translated in my language, gained a lot more of coolness. The only noticeable difference is being without Rachel Weisz. The role of Evelyn was tailored for her, and when you change the actor for a main character hardly you can get real great results. But anyway Maria Bello, the way she was dressed and also her look gave to the movie the real sense of the 40s. I can't be a proper critic because I'm not into the movie industry, but I think many movie companies have to say thanks to some foreign countries that with the dubbing, always save at last movies that maybe in their original country are a secure flop. But also for many other reasons...it's all in the sponsoring...if you make a good captivating trailer, it's easy that people goes to see your movies... Here ""The Mummy 3"" was a discreet success... Universal have to say a huge ""thank you"" to Italy.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
418,tabitha-willson,6 out of 10,6,16 August 2008,"I am a huge fan of the previous Mummy movies and actually went into this one after reading BAD REVIEWS from IMDb. I thought that Maria Bello was going to break the movie but, to me at least, she just portrayed an older version of the Evie that we all knew and loved. Granted, she can never take the place of Rachel Weisz in our hearts but she manages well. My biggest issue with the movie was that it was so cheesy. Issue and delight actually. The extreme cheesiness of the film gave it a hilarity that is rarely seen. Take for example every time that Rick and Evie think about having sex, the music would come on and everyone would chuckle in the theatre only to have it taken away each time. Jet Li made the Dragon Emperor. I can't think of anyone who could have played that role better. It wasn't the best movie ever but it was fun and entertaining and it's a must-see to anyone needing a comedy to calm them down after a long day.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
419,ericnasariosoto,Good but short action mummy movie,9,1 August 2008,"I saw the new mummy movie on August 1, 2008. I wanted to see it because I enjoyed watching the first two mummy movies. Also, it was the third mummy movie and that Jet Li was going to be in it. Basically, Jet Li is an all powerful emperor of China who got cursed by a pretty sorceress. Basically, he was cursed because he wanted the sorceress to be his woman but she fell in love with his general/friend and that he wants immortality. After the opening scene, Alex finds the tomb for his boss and just when he was about to be famous, his parents, Rick O'Connell and Evie O'Connell, go to China to deliver an item to the Chinese people and as they are in China, they reunite with Alex and Jonathan, who was in China running a Chinese club. Unfortunately, the villains in the movie, which were Alex's boss, a Chinese military general, and the Chinese military general's lady friend, force Rick and Evie to revive the Dragon Emperor. After Rick and Evie revive the Dragon Emperor, the Dragon Emperor continues his quest for immortality and seeks to take over the world. So, Rick, Alex, Evie, Jonathan and Alex's acquaintance, Lin go on a quest to stop/destroy the Dragon emperor.Overall, the movie was very good. The movie had a lot of action. The action was awesome and realistic. Alex, Rick and all the characters kicked ass by fighting hand to hand, wielding swords, and shooting guns. The romance/love scenes were awesome. Evie and Rick looked good while Alex and Lin had their thing and made it good and believable for the audience. The movie also had a lot of funny scenes and dialog. Jet Li was really good as the Dragon Emperor despite not speaking English whenever he talked but he was real good. He made the Dragon Emperor a very tough, mean, cruel and heartless villain. All the actors were pretty good. Plus, I like the way that Alex matured and became like his father. Luke Ford did a good job at playing Alex. Maria Bello did a nice job of playing Evie because she made her funny and tough. Also, she made Evie look more older since the movie takes place in 1947. Brendan Fraser rocks as Rick and he is still an excellent actor.The only thing I did not like about Dragon Emperor was that it was too short and that Jet Li did not speak English when he spoke and that he had very little talk time. But, the movie is worth seeing. If you all have seen and enjoyed the previous Mummy films, then go and watch this one unless you do not want to. For new audiences, go and watch it when you get the chance to.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

Very few films have the audience gazing longingly at their watches within the first fifteen minutes, but this is certainly one of them. It's slow, disjointed, repetitive, poorly written, poorly directed and thoroughly disappointing. Witty one-liners become stale after the very first, John Hannah's role is completely unnecessary and extremely annoying, while another character even goes from a British accent in the last film, to an American in this! In a nutshell, it's a couple of hours out of your life you'll never get back, so take the family bowling instead.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
421,Heidelbach50,LIke Taking Nyquil....,2,2 August 2008,"I had hope for this movie. I was a big fan of the first two. The first thing I noticed was the absence of Rachel Weisz. In most action movies, the girl can be easily replaced and no one pays attention. Take the Dark Knight Rachel Dawes for example. However, Rachael Weisz's role in the Mummy was actually believable and she had great chemistry with the cast. I think it's cheap to replace someone that was a major part in the first two and think the audience will not notice the difference. As for the story, I will honesty say....my and my fiancé FELL ASLEEP during the first chase scene, and woke up when they were in some sort of temple in China being helped by Yetis. She has never fell asleep in the middle of the movie, being more embarrassing that it happened during an action sequence. I had to show her the first two to prove to her that they all weren't horrible. As for the special effects, I don't think a 3rd grader would find them believable. Waayyy too much CGI, to the point that it distracted me from the story. And their son? I don't think Brendan Fraser having a college aged son is appropriate. The guy's only forty for Christ's sake!

425,nanners21486,You get what you paid for...,7,6 August 2008,"... an outrageous, roaring good time. Is it the best movie EVER made? Absolutely not, however, I do think that it is within good ""mummy"" spirit.Before you go see this movie you have to understand a few things. For starters, the movie is not really a sequel so much as its own separate entity. Second, the movie does have some 'kung-fu' style fighting, so if you aren't a fan of movies like Kill Bill or Kungfu Hustle... this probably isn't the film for you.To elaborate a bit on the first part, the movie shouldn't be compared to either of the first two films. It simply doesn't fit into the natural mummy arc. It is an entirely different journey with entirely different characters. If you can remove the idea that the three films are linked, then you may actually be able to enjoy the film. There is a lot of action, corny humor, and unbelievable special effects. There are also quite a few new monsters/creatures that will leave you wanting more. As I said, if you can look at it as an individual film, you will most likely enjoy it.

427,nimbus_11,The Mummy; It's Not Really There,2,6 August 2008,"SPOILER WARNINGThe Mummy: Tomb of The Dragon Emperor held many hopes for me. The trailers promised an action packed movie and a good story-line. I was well aware the Al & Miles were responsible for the script. I had to convince myself that they WOULD not ruin the Mummy, as they have ruined certain aspects of our very own Man of Steel. I knew Maria Bello had replaced Rachel Weisz, but I was willing to trust her as the new Evy. So, knowing all this, I went to the theater to watch the third installment of the Mummy. The result? I found the so called action-movie to be more of a comedy. The Evy we knew before was completely gone! She was replaced by a cheesy-novel writer. I found the scene when she's trying to come up with ideas completely ridiculous. In the first two movies she was a cultural woman, a museum's curator. Her only sense for adventure only lied purely in her interest for the past, not for some kind of ""spy rush"" if I may call it that. I do realize it's not Maria Bello's fault, she worked with what she was given. You must excuse me, but I believe Al & Miles might have as well written the script with crayons.The character of Rick didn't go through mayor changes, but I felt like his old spark was gone.Now another big issue lies in Alex O'Connell. The first idiocy I'll point out is his American accent. He grew up in England and it's unreasonable to think that he would copy his father, if anything it's a shock that Rick kept his accent! Alex, proved to be a great disappointment, not because of his ""bad boy"" vibe, because if that's what they were trying to achieve, they failed. He was portrayed poorly by the actor they chose, he simply didn't cut it.Isabella Leong (Li) did an amazingly bad job. Her character was less than believable. Her relationship with Alex was nothing short of a joke. I don't know about you but does this sound like love to you: ""I'm not attracted to you. A day later: We can't be together, I'm immortal."" WHAT?Does the title give too much away? It's called The Mummy Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, and yet you don't see much of the emperor. The should've called it "" The Mummy; It's Not Really There.""A lesson for life: Follow your gut, never trust the men that made Superman get down on his knees for an undeserving woman.So, Al & Miles, thank you. You've done it again.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
428,mnbvcxztr,Director has no control over his narrative,6,20 August 2008,"Borrowing every beat it can from the entire Indiana Jones lexicon, it's a routine romp which owes more to the modern technology of today than the giddy joys of the '30s serials it constantly steals from. Rob Cohen, whose resume all but mandates this kind of slipshod spectacle, has no control over his narrative. He wastes time on unimportant subplots and massive expositional exchanges. Even worse, he cribs from the bloated visual excess of franchise founder Stephen Sommers. During the final confrontation, what looks like every corpse takes on a garrison of walking clay effigies so massive it must have taken every motherboard in Silicon Valley to render. Of course, all this computer pomposity has to result in something else being sacrificed. In the case of Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, it's character, logic, fun, excitement, and a sense of popcorn escapism.Cohen completely loses us in quick cut action, his editing frequently ruining the rhythm of a fight. This is especially true when Li and Yeoh throw down who are known for their swordplay and physical grace, how can you defend a film which wastes the undeniable talents of Li and Yeoh. At several points throughout the film, a character will take a moment and shriek ""I hate mummies.""; fake as faux fur snowmen show up during the second act and become bodyguards for our heroes. They even know the practical way to avoid an avalanche.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
429,akorney,Meh...,6,14 July 2008,"Now, I'm not one to bash the Mummy series. Sure, they've never been masterpieces of brilliance, but they've always had a charm to them both in adventure in comedy which I've loved though I and II. However, at a test screening I attended in LA, I sat through the entire film, and kept waiting for it to get better. Now, the premise was solid and I thoroughly enjoyed each character for what they were (i.e., they did what they were supposed to do). However, I didn't really care what happened to anyone. I actually think that Jet Li did the best acting, but Frasier still put on a good show. Humor-wise, the only times the audience laughed were when:A) A really bad line came up (trust me, there's allot) B) The guy sitting behind me started laughing randomlySo, the final verdict in my opinion is, if you've seen the first two mummies, see it! It brings back the feel of the other Mummies, so you get what you paid for. However, don't expect the same. Expect a little less. The actors/ writers clearly expected the charm and past of the characters to carry over, thinking that we've already been won over. Thus, they don't really even try.Whelp, it's okay. There you have it. I really wanted to like it more than I did, but it was so outlandishly stupid at times and nobody else was laughing that I couldn't get into it. I'd say it was the same as the new Hulk film possibly. It's okay, you get what you expected, and then it's over.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

About this movie then. well I did enjoy it but not as much as the previous 2. I enjoyed it in its own way. When I watched it I just felt like I wasn't watching The mummy 3, in fact it didn't feel like a sequel. Just a completely different Movie. It was very good and the story was excellent- based on a true story about the terracotta soldiers! I was longing for Rachel as Evie. Although the actress that played her in this movie was good I just kept thinking how better it would have been with Rachel in. I was so glad to see Brenden Fraizer again as Rick and John Hannah made the movie funny with his character of Uncle John! As for Alex o'Connol. The actor was very good but I felt that they cast a too older actor to play him. And no disrespect he was American sounding and Alex in the mummy 2 spoke very British and his hair colour was different. I really wish they had cast Freddie Boath to play Alex again. Freddie is 17 now, the same age Alex is spoced to be in the Mummy 3.

431,yiiop5,Another case of CG abuse,6,14 August 2008,"The movie starts out with a 20-30 minute intro to some mythology behind the Dragon Emperor which I thought was pretty interesting. Then we go to The O'Connells, Rick (Brendan Fraser) and Evelyn (Maria Bello takes over for Rachel Weisz), who are retired and itching to get back into action. They end up getting involved with their son Alex (Luke Ford), which happens to look much older than Rick, and Evelyn's brother Jonathon (John Hannah) to take down the evil Emperor Han.I was genuinely looking forward to watching The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor since I thought the first two were actually entertaining. The first two installments of The Mummy had the action, comedy and an actual mummy. Naturally, I was expecting much of the same but more action since Jet Li (Dragon Emperor) and Michelle Yeoh (2,000 year old witch) were in the movie.The best part of this movie is the very short fight scene between Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh.

Then I watched the movie and found it a great action flick. Good story line, a deliciously evil mummy/emperor in Jet Li, action packed scenes, cool cgi, a family story and a romance and more. Then again, I am an avid fan of the mummy series. And they had yetis. lol.I was so incensed, I actually signed up for an account, just to leave a comment asking the reviewers what they had or had not been smoking. I think the reviews had something to do with the original actress who played Brendan Frazier's wife in the first two movies, turning down the role. Some say it was because the script was bad, others say its because she's won the British Oscar since the film and is a big shot now. So, feeding frenzy, I guess.But I liked the movie and was glad I didn't allow the ratings to stop me from watching it. Do any of you follow movie critiques when selecting what to watch?

They introduce Brendan Fraisers son a much older version in this film. He is just like his dad but cant pull off the lines like the goofy Fraiser can. Also, they don't pull off the father/son thing to well. He looks about 5-10 years younger than father. The interaction between father and son was some of the worst and uncomfortable to watch moments I've seen in film in awhile. There are just a lot of moments in this film where you will just shake your head and pray for the next action sequence. The action parts of the movie were top quality and sound effects were amazing. Those were definitely top notch. To bad they cant carry the film. Jet Li did some awesome action scenes(when doesn't he though?).

434,quik_silver,Exactly what is wrong with Hollywood...,1,4 August 2008,"This movie represents all that is wrong with Hollywood, turning our favourite movies and characters into soul-less factory products, and here's why. The Mummy series was an entertaining, funny, action packed series and even though the second one was a little more cliché and hammy than it should have been (they should have gone in a darker direction), the movie still had a soul and you could tell that it was made with love because you felt at least something sitting in your local cinema, watching it.About the new installment; firstly, this movie should not have been in the Mummy series. It looked as if it had been forced to fit into the Mummy mythology to milk out the name of the franchise, because technically, Jet Li wasn't a mummy (more like a walking clay man) and everything from the Mummy series looked like it was forced to fit the story. The story was actually quite good, with a lot of potential to be a great movie, and had they made it something along the lines of the Forbidden Kingdom (Jet Li, Jackie Chan), with a better script and in the hands of a more capable director, it might have turned out to be an excellent movie. But, of course this cash-cow needed to be milked to the last drop.I'll go as far as to say that the acting in the new film wasn't BAD (but it was bad) and the effects and CGI were spot on (best of the three, though they were glitchy in a few places). But the movie felt like it had been made in a factory, an assembly line, where a computer randomly generated the script from a database of clichéd scripts and one liners and the scenes were put together and the giant special effects machine made everything shiny. And without human intervention, this came out as a soul-less, heartless film where you feel absolutely nothing sitting in front of the screen, watching the action, the romance, the ""funny"" one-liners and the mandatory action score played in the background. But of course this was made by a person; maybe as heartless and soul-less as Hollywood itself to let such an abysmal piece of work be released, no less under the banner of a film franchise we all loved.Avoid at all costs; even the shiny special effects aren't worth the time and money you spend watching it.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

I'm not certain why he only changed into a dragon once and then scampered around the final battle as a sort of troll-bear; but this movie was more fun than the second one (with the pygmy mummies and all the stupid Arab stereotypes).If you're looking for a serious study of mummies, look up a National Geographic Special.

436,geom46,The mummy: tomb of your hard earned cash.,2,7 August 2008,"Despite vague reviews online, (and the fact Pineapple Express was sold out), I went in this movie with pretty good expectations. From the trailer and the advertising, it looked like a movie with an interesting plot and some decent action. And for the first half of the movie I really did try to enjoy this movie, I tried to get wrapped up in the generic plot, the predictable jokes and the abysmal reactions to events in the movie. I told myself hey, even if the writing isn't top quality the action isn't too bad and I mean Jet Li pulled off some pretty cool moves. But when Jet Li gets mummified, the quality seriously goes downhill. Even Brendan Fraser who is ""supposedly"" a good actor ends up looking stupid and you can tell: he does not really like this movie. Their son Alex is even a worst let down, portraying all of the emotions, scared, excited, happy, with the devotion of a 4 year old. And the worst part I think, was the writing. The combination of the exaggerated reactions and some ""plot twists"" caused me almost burst out crying and laughing out loud in the near empty theater. Most of the time when the Chinese girl talked I had to stuff my fist into my mouth to stop from laughing. I couldn't help but feel bored at the ""intense"" action scenes which include Brendan Fraser and Luke Ford riding down a Chinese street or trying to blow up the mountain. But even though some of the more serious stuff was downright funny I couldn't help but feel sad that I had walked in this theater with 10 dollars less and that my money was better spent playing time crisis over and over again. At the end I was seriously debating if it was my general responsibility to stand outside to tell people that this was downright one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Please do not see this movie, even if you are a hardcore mummy fan just rent one of the old ones, which I agree are still bad but are Oscar worthy when compared to this movie.

437,Dallardo,I really wanted to like it.,1,1 August 2008,"*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT* This is an example of a film which, if you cannot resist the urge to see even after a plethora of bad reviews, should only be seen on a late night showing on TBS. You know - the ones where they show the same movie three times in a row.First thing's first: the lack of character development and the overuse of predictable violence in the movie is obnoxious. The characters, all of them, seemed desperately one dimensional and, to be quite honest, boring and repetitive. John Hannah, being the most enthusiastic of the bunch to actually deliver a performance which would not be confused with a casual reading, tries his best to inject some type of personality into his role, but is shot down at every turn by his own lines and the situations in which he is in. Hannah's role in this movie was, as usual, comic relief. This is not new. What is new is the startlingly little effort that was put into writing his lines (and the entire script follows suite).Maria Bello is another disappointment. John Travolta could have done a better job if he dressed like the fat chick in Hairspray. It wasn't all her fault though. Rachel Weisz did such a phenomenal job creating a cute but feisty librarian type that anyone else would have had a hard time competing. Not to mention that Bello looks absolutely nothing like Weisz and has a horrible English accent. It was quite distracting.Throughout the film the characters are constantly (constantly here meaning every few minutes) getting themselves into situations of impossible odds and their equally impossible, but unsettlingly convenient, solutions which have no chance of working. What is more, where as in the first two movies there were unknowns which had to be investigated, moments of uncertainty, and vulnerability, in this movie everyone seemed to know everything at the same convenient time. It was like they were all one person - one person who wrote a really bad story.There were also questions I had about the characters and their situations. For example: If The Dragon Emperor was so hated because of his oppressive and ruthless character, then why did someone take the care to put him in an elaborately constructed crypt with all of his army meticulously arranged? What is more, How and who did this? If it was Yoeh's Character, how did she survive the trip from the Chinese desert to a remote place in the Himalayas in B.C. China? (And so on and so forth There will be many of these types of questions) Can anyone explain to me how a script this bad makes it all the way up the corporate ladder, and then goes into months of production and expense without someone blowing the whistle and saying ""WTF is this?!"" I would have loved to be at one of the meetings where this script was approved for production, and then approved for a budget of almost 200 million.Maybe they'll write a new one that's just as typical  ""The Mummy: King Tut in New York""",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

439,emtekworks,Truly awful,1,2 August 2008,"First, Brendan Fraser is an actor who I really enjoy watching no matter what he's in. Second, I was hoping he would do another mummy movie - I like him in these campy action movies so I was looking forward to this movie. Now I wish he had turned this one down as Rachel did, I wouldn't have wasted my money. And I have a high tolerance for so-so movies. I felt so bad for Fraser, he was trying - but you can only do so much with a crappy script and poor direction.Pros: Very good special effects. Jet-Li, Yeoh had good fight scenes.Cons: Forced dialogue, Maria Bello trying too hard, No chemistry between Fraser-Bello-Ford (the son). Music either too much or just not a good fit, I found it overwhelming the scenes at times.Everything comes across as trying too hard. I miss the Sommers touch. I just didn't have any fun this time. Seriuosly, wait for it to come to cable.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
440,drunkdionysus,Only worth a few laughs,3,31 July 2008,"The movie started out very well with an interesting introduction, but it went downhill from then on. I was very disappointed with this sequel. Weak storyline, mediocre acting and unimpressive CGI. The action was exciting but monotonous after a few scenes. I was looking forward to this movie, being a fan of the first two, but this was a forgettable movie, without much fun. There were amusing moments here and there, but mostly cheesy catchphrases that you would like if you were about thirteen years old.I have to commend Maria Bello for attempting to portray Evenlyn in a satisfactory manner, but she's no Rachel Weiss and that is painfully obvious in all her scenes, and she has little chemistry with Brendan Frasier. I didn't like the Rick-Alex relationship either, it was as far off from The Mummy Returns as possible! Michelle Yeoh was probably the only part of the movie worth seeing, but the script did her no favours. Jet Li was completely wasted in this film, and coupled with a painfully inaccurate representation of 1940s Shanghai, this film had no saving features. Not even worth it if you just want some mindless fun. Spend your money on a second viewing of The Dark Knight or some other movie.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
441,wrick3000,Horror movie filled with comedy n unanswered questions BUT NO HORROR,6,1 August 2008,"IT's not gonna be as much hit as the 1st 2 part. I just watched the movie, not quite impressed. NO Rachel Weisz is a very bad move. As Maria Bello is playing her part I can't see her in place of Rachel.BUT Bello's acting is still gr8. BUT THE STORY is more of a COMEDY than being SERIOUS. IT SHOULD BE SERIOUS at some parts but NO. They all are sort of BORING n COMEDY actions. And they included YETI!!!!!!!! really NOT WAT I EXPECTED. The makers of the movie really made this movie for making money not to serve a good story. AND how the hell ALEX grew up so fast?? Does he got any mummy spell?? How the horse of THE EMPEROR become real without any dip in the IMMORTAL WATER?? When THE EMPEROR was cursed he is somewhat facing the sky but how he was mummified in a chariot as he is already stoned?? What is the point of charging arrows by the dead to the dead as they all are dead, they just stood up and started fighting again?? JET LI's acting is no doubt more than awesome.I think he liked to get STONED as in FORBIDDEN KINGDOM now this. Don't think OF ANY HORROR in this movie u will be disappointed. GO n enjoy it as a comedy u will enjoy it very much. AND YES IF U FIND THOSE ANSWERS OF THE QUESTIONS I JUST ASKED PLZ DO REPLY....",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
442,scocci,don't bother,1,1 August 2008,"OK, don't bother with this movie if you enjoyed the first two as much as i did. this one sucked. there's no nicer way to say it. Brendan Fraser was not at his best, and i don't think it was really his fault. the character of Evie went way south, which was marred even farther by the fact that Rachel Weisz was not playing her. John Hannah was good as always at least, but that was the only bonus. Jet Li did not impress me that much. the CGI wasn't even that good. the story was stupid, and barely related to the previous ones at all. i loved the first two movies so much, this was a huge disappointment. i didn't expect it to be great, but i expected better than that. i barely sat through the whole thing and i rarely feel that during any movie. don't waste money on seeing this movie.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
443,jaywoolrich,"Utterly, utterly abysmal...",1,22 March 2010,"One of the worst films I've ever seen. Risible storyline, rote acting, abysmal dialogue and mediocre special effects. The scary stuff ain't scary and the comedy ain't funny. A waste of a decent cast (apart from the guy playing the son, who appears to be moonlighting from his job at McDonald's), and pretty disrespectful to a paying audience. It's a pity because it could have been an entertaining movie - but that would have required a decent script and a little TLC on the part of the film makers and producers. It really is an utter turkey, and clearly an attempt to cash in on the franchise without breaking into a sweat. I was lucky - I got the movie out of the local library for a quid. I wouldn't have been too happy if I'd paid good money to see it in the cinema. One to avoid, unless your other hobby is playing Pass The Brain-Cell...",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

Also the credits Graphics were wonderful.Apart from these everybody knows how the movie was. No offense please we should take healthy criticism. Actually I'm praising the Vfx studios and crew. Thanks a lot Digital Domain and Rhythm & Hues for such wonderful job. Seeing the movie, what it seemed that Jet lee had to work very less. It was the CG double who was doing most of the jobs. And also the fighting sequences. One more thing, I couldn't find out the reason for those transformations, are those relevant?? or were those just to show off the Visual effects budgets?

445,Ragout,If there would be an Oscar for Most Clichés in a Movie the Tomb of the Dragon Emperor would win it!,6,31 July 2008,"First I have to say that I only went to see it because Jet Li was in it and I have a subscription to the cinema. I hate Brendan Fraser so without Jet Li I wouldn't have seen it so bear in mind that this is really opinion based.I think this is an OK movie if you just want some entertainment. But if you are looking for a serious film or even a masterpiece then turn around and look for something like No Country For Old Men or go see The Dark Knight.From the start of the movie the acting was average, kind of like the other mummy films. But there were too many clichés from start to end!It wasn't clear for me who Ricks wife was but I guessed Maria Bello replaced Rachel Weiss. Maria Bello had a real annoying accent and was talking way too stiff and neat for this kind of movie so I didn't like her character. Also Rick has really cliché one-liners that just makes you wonder who could have made up such horrible lines.Rick and Eve are retired and are living the quiet and peaceful life. Of course some government guy shows up to offer them another job and naturally they take it because they are the only ones who can do it and in their hearts they know the quiet life isn't for them (where are the specials forces/spies/other special units?)Alex was supposed to be the hunk type of guy that of course scores the ""hot chick"" in the end but to me he seemed like a dork and I didn't understand why a girl like Lin would want anything with a guy who just gets himself beat up and has silly lines. But of course they fall in love because it is in the script. Also Alex acts really immature (like a 15 year old) yet he looks like hes 22 or something.Lin fights really well in the beginning against Alex yet when she faces the ""modern"" Chinese soldiers she is practically useless in most cases. Also Rick and Eve fight against ancient Chinese soldiers with swords but they are able to beat them. This seems really strange because they could never have had enough training to match the skill of such soldiers.The action scenes where unreal. Jet Li's character was supposed to be really strong and he had awesome abilities but he doesn't even use them in battle. In the ""end-battle"" Jet Li fights with Rick and Alex but he doesn't even use his powers, he just goes hand to hand. This is why he loses yet he could have easily set them on fire, freeze them solid, transform into his dragon or demon and bite them to death yet not of that happens and I was wondering the entire fight where his powers had gone.Also this movie had way too much in common with Indy 4: A father that has problems with his son; The father doesn't expect his son to be any hero yet the son turns out to be just like him; The Father is retired but returns to some foreign country for one last mission; Same time (post WWII)The CGI was average. I don't know the budget for this movie but it seemed as if they could have done better for a film such as this. The shot where Jet Li becomes immortal looks really fake and his head looks really cut-in.All in all the movie was fun to watch but a lot of it was cheesy, obviously fake and the entire film could have been a 100x better if it didn't have all the fore-mentioned.I give it a 6 because it was followable as a story, some parts of it where at least a bit of fun and some of the jokes were funny.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
446,brycemeister734-1,Not a movie to waste your time on,2,1 August 2008,"this movie leaves me no choice but to say that it was just terrible. This film is a prime example of a sequel that needed to be left alone. What most confuses me about this movie is the rating of pg-13. It showed decapitations and innocent people getting blown up an killed, not to mention the awkward and misplaced sexual innuendos. Why must the MPAA give breaks to large studio films on their rating?!?!?!?!?!?! Let Li was a waste in the film and no one seemed to know how to act. Last criticism, the graphics at many points seemed out- dated and forced. Redeeming quality: Michelle Yeoh, but she was also a wasted asset within the movie. If you like historically grotesque, blow your brains out corny, sappy romantic, and badly written movies then go a head and waste nine dollars and two hours of your life seeing it!",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
447,woczko,Nasty,3,19 August 2008,"Just got out of the cinema. I have to say, that expected the usual portion of good humor and action. But this time i was really disappointed. - Sometimes really poor computer animation - Horrible lines in many cases. They were probably supposed to be some snappy lines, but... - The construction of the story and characters which appear doesn't make sense (but that's not the most important thing on movie like this). - New ""main character"" in role of the sun, is simply not well played. It seems that casting was done only based on how good and deep his voice is. - Final act is nice, but is ruined again by horrible shots (e.g. the plane, etc.) - New actor for Mrs. O'C did her best (and well), but she doesn't simply fit there for me. - Was disappointed to see famous China actors in roles like these... :( Overall, i could watch it on TV during the Saturday evening.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
448,thespiderbanana,Do you like watching train wrecks?,1,1 August 2008,"OK,I'm giving this movie 1 star, because thats what it deserves. However, with that said, I feel the need to express how entertained I was. I don't remember ever laughing so hard at the theater. I don't want to give anything away, but there is a scene thats SO awful,(but so awesome in a sick, hysterical way) it almost rivals that infamous ""Shark Repellent Bat Spray"" scene from the 1960's Batman movie. (if you haven't seen it I suggest youtube-ing it. Hilarious) Honestly there was a good 20 or so seconds that I couldn't breath. I couldn't believe what was happening on the screen. It 'bout killed me I was laughing so hard. I got dragged into going to this movie so I could hang out with my friends. I had no actual desire to see it, even though i was a fan of the first ONE. If this movie would have just sucked, like i thought it would, it would have been a waste of time. But since it shattered my expectations of HORRABLE, it was surprisingly fun to watch, in a demented way. So... if you enjoy watching train wrecks... if you find joy in seeing something that is so bad, but then it gets SO much worse within a second, go see this movie and laugh your head off. but I suggest waiting till a dollar theater or something... otherwise, STAY AWAY FROM THIS HORRABLE MOCKERY OF A MOVIE!",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
449,freakycheekycharlie,Not necessary and shorter than expected.,5,8 August 2008,"Good Special effects, almost as good as the previous 2 mummy movies. But they definitely shouldn't have made this movie as a sequel to the other mummy movies. If one of the 2 key characters wasn't gonna be in this movie, then they really shouldn't have made it. It's kinda ruined the series in a way. Alex their son has an American accent, when in the other films he had very well spoken English accent. and Maria Bello tries to impersonate Rachel Weisz as best as possible, but shouldn't they have just pretended that it was Brendan's new wife or something?Plus why would Alex's parents look the same age as they did when Alex was 12 and now he's in his late 20's?",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

I really thought this was going to be great , I was wrong, this movie sucks. Although the storyline isn't bad , actually its quite good and special effects are pretty good , but all the good things that this movie has , is ruined by the bad cast. From my point of view , Rachel Weisz was the one to make the Mummy first and second film feel right , her humor and sarcasm made those films great. But in this film she didn't play , Maria Bello took her place. And Maria failed totally, I have seen her in other movies , she is a good actress. But o god why couldn't Rachel Weisz replay her role. I would have loved this movie if she would have played in it.

451,white_butterfly897,didn't see the point to be honest,2,14 August 2008,OK went to see this film last night and it seriously was a waste of time and money. Im never going to get either back. It didn't have any of the humour or action or anything of the first two and jet li was completely wasted in this film. Half way through i was thinking about shopping and housework that I had to do instead of concentrating on the film. the part that completely screwed up any chance of me liking the film was the part when the yetis celebrated the fact that they had threw a man. i thought they were going to high 5 each other. all in all definitely not worth watching in my opinion.,The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

He does a great job in this one, as he did in ""The Forbidden Kingdom"". I recommend. Don't get me wrong, I love Brendan Fraser, I really do, but seems to me that he's not shows himself in the movie. At least they could make him older or Luke Ford younger, that's what make up is for, isn't it? I know that Freddie Boath is 17 now, perhaps tried to make him older would be a good idea or wait a little more to make this sequence... John Hannah could be more lines, his character is so funny! Maria Bello doesn't fit in Eve... Too much accent I guess. Sorry to say, but Rachel Weisz is always be Evelyn. The movie it's just watchable, nothing more. :)",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

I think she was't really thinking about the fans. She was thinking about her career, but even so the 2 mummy was like this one. It wasn't very good, in fact it went way overboard with the cgi and yet we forgive it. Why? One reason... We love the cast. We love the cast so much that we forgive the fact that if never saw mummy 1 you would be totally lost.So why are not willing to do the same with mummy 3. It comes down to one person Rachael weize. We miss her so much that were not even willing to give Marlo bello a chance.

Luke is playing 19 year old Alex and Luke is 27 years old and sometimes in the movie Luke looked older than Brendan. I just wish that they picked a younger actor to play Alex.

455,sandro-funny,Not a total waste of time,5,2 August 2008,"First the Bad The thing that most kills this movie is the lack of chemistry between the two ""couples"" in this movie. Brendan Fraser and Maria Bello just don't click. When Luke Ford and Isabella Leong kissed, it seemed to be uncomfortable for both of them again, no chemistry. The only way the plot could be more predictable is if they had a guy announcing what was going to happen next. I was also disappointed as to how easily Jet Li's immortal all powerful character was killed. I expected more of a fight from a guy who is a shape shifter and controls the five elements.Now the good If you ignore the shallow plot and the fact that throughout most of the movie you have skeletons screaming at the top of their inexistent lungs then you are in for 112 minutes of popcorn munching while watching gunfire, explosions and mummy ass kicking. Action sequences are OK, and the animations are quite good. The Yetis are cool.  I want to send Kudos to Zi Juan (Michelle Yeoh) because she reads the first curse in Sanskrit, and the second one at the end in English. Apparently spell casting has evolved.It may be the worst of the Mummy movies so far, but I don't consider it a total waste of time.

456,Anthony_G_Simonetta,Nothing For Everyone,2,1 August 2008,"I will admit, this was one movie that I was seriously looking forward to. Unfortunately, I was severely disappointed by this movie. All around the movie was weak and un-enjoyable. Brendan Frasier (spelling?) was awful. I have never particularly liked him as an actor, but this was such bad acting. Furthermore, the (supposed) ""humorous moments"" were lame, ridiculous, and the only thing laughable about them was the movies attempt to make you laugh. The main thing that bothered me and my wife was the completely ridiculous realism of the movie. I know... I know a movie is entertainment and even more so, a movie like ""The Mummy"" has to be a little unbelievable; but seriously, bombs being dropped on people and they come out with minor burns, avalanches that have tons and tons of weight crashing forward and blasting characters (especially the unprotected general) and the character surviving? Also, the movies ""heartfelt moments"" were laughable, stupid, and downright un-heartfelt. They were so bad, I (and those around me) laughed at the ridiculous display of ""affection"". This movie had so much promise and it was sloppy, poorly acted, and not funny at all.

It has quite a few scenes where you can have a laugh or two, but there were no intense parts or thrilling parts. Maybe just some, scattered in the whole movie but totally not what I was expecting.The starting of the movies was kind of OK, giving you the mysterious feeling and so on. Then it just goes no where, spending half of the movie time setting the plot and showing you all the characters and their life, goals...and then comes the somewhat interesting parts but it comes as suddenly as it goes.It's really not THAT bad but if you want to go watch it, don't go with high expectation because that will only lead you to be disappointed like me.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
458,syrentie,A total disappointment.,2,4 August 2008,"I knew that the movie isn't what it was going to be. I knew that Rachel Weiz was not going to be starring in the Mummy. I thought that the substitute actress might not be so bad and that Jet Li is starring there. So, why not... What I did not know is that it's going to be one of the worst experiences of movie-watching in my life. My first and greatest disappointment was when I saw Maria Bello. Forget the looks, but she is NOTHING like Evelyn from the first two movies. Come on, this isn't Evie's character! Evie was lovable, funny and cute. This woman, well... She is nothing of sorts, and I don't even mean the looks! Second disappointment - Evelyn's and Rick's son - Alex... I mean... He look almost as old as they do! He could do as Rick younger brother, but SON? Please! Unbelievable! Third disappointment - the overuse of graphical effects and stunts. There are just too much of them! It's probably to make up for the poor story. I know that stories about mummies are never too deep and sensational, but previous two movies seemed to capture the viewers attention and hold on to it through the whole movie, this one fails to do so. Also, the acting is poor. Even Rick does not seem to be the same charismatic person. Well, yeah, I understand, with a wife like that, you'd change too! The only one still himself is Evelyn's brother. Cheers to that! Personally, I liked Jet Li! Except that he is too busy being Jet Li and not the mummy... Not that I have anything against it.

The acting in the film falls from its previous levels; the new director has the subtly and talent of a ten-year old directing a film. There are no real thrills; i found the best parts of the film were talking to my friend about how BAD the film was. The new actress Maria Bello gives a laughable performance (an appalling British accent) along with poor chemistry between Fraiser; who himself is just as bad or worse. However the worst part wasn't the plot or terrible chemistry between Ford and Leong who not only annoy the viewer but put the scene out of place; chemistry comes from no-where; its the comedy. Nothing was funny, the fake of every line was in toe with the acting; every joke was bland and annoying; actor John Hannah was incurably, frustratingly annoying. Every joke was cheesy and at the lowest level of wit and timing.

Firstly..the cast.I give them a 0 for Chemistry.And Brendan fraser,where is his on screen charisma of the first 2 films?maybe it was due to the different cast this time around.What made the first two films so brilliant was that it was actually pretty scary at certain parts,while carrying with it a little humour.This time i was laughing my head off.The YETI?lol.Come on!There was no plot development.Everything was just rushed to make it to the great battle between the 2 armies.At the end of the film,Rachel's brother said that he is off to Peru!That might be a hint to us viewers of a 4th Mummy Film.I would definitely WELCOME it.BUT please get stephen sommers back as director and get back to basics.The first 2 films CGI were not that impressive compared to this film,But it was much much more enjoyable.This film is just as disappointing as the latest Indiana Jones Flick.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

I am sure Yeti's don't know about Football goals... giving us nothing new, lots of over used ideas and themes, and lots of boredom = a waste of money, and time.Even if this wasn't bad enough the musical score leaves something to be desired, and would have helped the lack of plot and horrible graphics. Randy Edelman's style of composition is far to light and upbeat to fit in this kind of movie where you should at least feel some sort of foreboding and action sequence packed movie in comparison with the compositional pieces of Alan Silvestre's menacing masterpieces which draw you further into the movie and helps to keep your heart pumping and butt on the edge of your seat. I also have to agree with a post written earlier about Hollywood not having many ideas left and having to go and try to break into Asian stylistics, and story lines to make something sell here in the states, too bad they just aren't as well done here as they are there.So there you have it folks, spend your money else where don't be disappointed with the end of the mummy trilogy (with no true mummy's..) if you liked it good for you, if you didn't I feel your pain, maybe in the future there will be a better ending.

The special effects were pretty good. Fact is, you can't throw in special effects, even great one's, and have an excellent movie. It dragged on like a bad reality show. The worst part is that even after hearing from one of the movie theatre attendant that the movie didn't do that good I still went to see it and gave it up over Hellboy II and Mama Mia!!!!

465,csgomez79,What the . . .,6,1 August 2008,"We just got home from seeing the Mummy 3. Two words - ""Rachel Weisz"". The whole film felt like it was lacking. This Mummy lacked chemistry between all actors. I don't know why Rachel didn't do the movie, but if it was money, they should have paid it. Her replacement was totally wrong for the part. Brendan Fraser was awesome as in the last two, but without Rachel Weisz the story just wasn't complete; and neither were the O'Connels. My wife and I are huge fans of the Mummy series, but we left this movie very disappointed.We would have preferred it if Rachel was on some trip somewhere in the beginning and came back at the end of the movie. Or start the movie out sad with her dying of some illness and then continue the movie. Neither one of us could get into the movie with the replacement. Fraser didn't look connected with the other actress at all throughout the movie; and he seemed like he was trying too hard to make the connection. Fraser and Weisz was the only way to go - there is just something about their on-screen chemistry that works. It would be like trying to replace Carrie Fisher in Star Wars VI with someone else. It doesn't work.The overall story is okay. It seemed they tried a little too hard to push the son's love story. The martial arts were awesome. My favorite parts included the Yetis, Fraser, and Jet Li throughout the movie.If you are true Mummy fan, then this will be a disappointment to you.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
466,eli-193,The conspiracy of the sequels,1,2 August 2008,"Guys, What is going on here?? is that a conspiracy created by Steven Spielberg to get back at everyone because they ruined Jaws with their sequels?? I mean, take a look: 1. Indiana Jones 4 - shame, just shame, it killed Indy's figure for me in the old movies as well. 2. Shrek 3 - I wasn't sure its the actual movie until it went over 15 minutes then I realized that its not a gig. 3. Pirates of the Caribbeans 3 - many Jack Sparrows? what?? 4. Die Hard 4 - if he wouldn't have said ""Yipikaye..."" at the end I would have forgotten it's a Die Hard sequel (and the other 3 were SO good)... 5. Spiderman 3 - absolutely no comment! 6. Endless Batman sequels - why? was that any good sometime? * The only one that surprisingly saved the day was Stallone in Rambo IV, that was a real John Rambo movie!! (also updated to its time)So regarding the Mummy, well.. as everybody I adored the other two, they were really really good, I mean parts like the boat in the Nile (""the key? the key? what key? :-) ), the charming landscape of Egypt and Cairo at the early years of the 20th century, the prison scene and the almost hanging of O'Connell, boy he was a tough dude there.. he also acted like one! the music and sound effects were strong and passionate (voices of lions as the mummies pretty did the job), the revealing of the way to stop Imhotep, the romantic scenes in the desert, revealing the way to Hamonaptra - city of the dead, Oded Fehr as Ardath Bay, Arnold Vosloo as the mummy, its just full of good stuff and this is only the first movie. Of course the second one had great scenes and parts as well but the third one just murdered it! I mean - Stephen Sommers - COME ON MAN!!! what the hell is wrong with you? you made it so big, why giving it to Rob Cohen? why doing it? didn't you have enough time to think of a script? give me half the time with your money and I'm doing something your audience will bow to you, PLEASE!!!!I wanted to say for last that there are no good movies this decade as there were in the 90's but hey - there's Iron Man! :)Have fun everyone and don't give in to fat, rich and bored filmmakers (like George Lucas) that kills the vibe of their own films!:-)",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

I think Brendan Frazer missed Rachel Weiss to he wasn't as happy looking. they had a better chemistry it didn't c like a mummy movie w/o Rachel Weiss!! I really miss her!! but i liked it overall!

468,armyslowrdr,light hearted entertainment that doesn't muddle the mind,8,2 August 2008,"Actually I enjoyed the character Ling.And I like light movies. Yes some may say the series seems tired, but not to me. It reminded me of the 2d Indiana Jones movie quite a bit. Especially the scenes in the casino reminded me of the opening sequence of T.O.D. As far as the leading lady; I thought she was OK--certainly not spectacular, but as far as I'm concerned the performance did not detract from the movie.I will say overall that I enjoyed this slightly more than this year's Indy movie and WAY more than the dreadful mess that passed as Batman entertainment.There was a lot of humor in this movie and I like all the stories I watch to entertain with at least some laughter/cheesiness factor.The surround mix was incredible. Maybe it was the venue where I saw it. The Premiere 12 in Temple, Texas is 6 years old or so now I think, but the presentation beats the newer plexes in the Killeen area. They presented in DTS and ran the sound not hot, which sadly the others do, lending to a very muddled sound field. Visuals and effects were great too. At least as good as this year's Indy. In fact as I recall in one of the mummies or their spinoffs, I sat there thinking is the same joke gunna play over and over (some of that in this year's Indy).So I must disagree with all the reviewers out there giving rotten tomatoes and the like just coz nothing's new. It's entertainment folks--and it is new--just coz it uses some of the same gags and etc doesn't mean it's not worthwhile.Aah I guess I'm just a sucker for pretty Asian actresses..maybe that's the problem.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

People keep complaining about the new Evelyn in this movie, who cares! Maria does a good job and I think they all work well together. I was skeptical before seeing this because I read a lot of negative reviews about people not liking it only for the fact that Rachel isn't in it, but I decided to see it and I was pleasantly surprised! And also I absolutely love Brenden Fraiser and I was excited to see him back for another mummy movie! He was really funny in this movie and I actually got quite a few laughs! In the end it seems like they're could be a possibility for another mummy movie and I hope they're will be, because I know i will totally be seeing that!

The women who played her part was quite simply useless....I hated her from the outset.Overall the film's acting is very poor...mainly because the other cast members are let down by the guy who plays Rik and Evlyns kid and the stupid women who took over Racheal Weiz role.Plus, Jonathon had almost not relevance to the plot...I got the impression his character was there for the sake of it.Absolute rubbish and a complete let down....don't waste your time.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

473,pee_wee-1,All you could want from a Mummy film - minus one important actress,7,7 August 2008,"When I entered the cinema today to see The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, I felt certain that I would be getting a film that was great fun to watch, didn't worry too much about the plot and was supported by some great casting. But, very rarely for me, I was wrong, on two counts. This film had all the action, and all the laughs of its predecessors, yet it certainly had the strongest plot out of all of the trilogy. On this occasion, I was glad to be wrong. However, the casting was where it all fell apart, hence why this film has earned 7 brownie points from me, rather than the 9 it would have otherwise deserved. Firstly, Maria Bello was quite possibly the worst choice for Evelyn that could possibly have been made. I noticed more chemistry between Jonathon and that yak than between Rick and Evelyn in this movie. Secondly, Luke Ford, while a decent actor, bore no family resemblance to either Brendan or Maria. By the way, did anybody else remember that in the second movie, his hair was blond? Quite a large slip up there. There were five saving graces in the cast, however: Brendan Fraser once again pulled off Rick O'Connell, Jet Li was equally as evil as his predecessor, Michelle Yeoh was astounding as Zi Yuan and John Hannah provided plenty of comic relief with his lovably irritating Jonathan. Finally, the Yetis! These were an unexpected addition that, surprisingly, worked quite well.To finish, go and see this movie if you want a film that gives some cheap thrills, without pretending to be anything else.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

However, not comparing it to the other two, this movie was very interesting. They writers tried something different than mummies in Egypt which was smart because another movie dealing with Imotept would have been a little on the boring side. It was full of action and quite funny (intentionally) and I believe that Maria Bello is a much better Evy because she doesn't seem so cold and unfriendly. People should really give it a chance because I found it to be highly entertaining and I can't wait to buy it on DVD. I am also looking forward to the upcoming sequels.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

I would've enjoyed it, but one thing ruined it for me, or I should say one person - Maria Bello! What was the casting director for this movie thinking?!!!! Her accent was terrible, she looked more like Brendan's mom than his wife, and for goodness sake - hasn't anyone heard of CHEMISTRY, because there was ZERO, NADA, NIL!!!! I missed Rachel so much. I remember the first look between Brendan and her in the original movie, they didn't even need words, they SIZZLED together. So what happened to Evie being half Egyptian, what happened to Alex' beautiful English accent? Luke Ford (though quite handsome) looked like Brendan's smaller brother. It had potential if they would've had a real fan of the franchise help with the casting. I still love you Brendan!!!",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
477,patrick-coen,Atrocious,1,8 August 2008,"I will start by saying that I really enjoyed the first two movies. They were corny but highly entertaining. This movie on the other hand is not at all entertaining!!! The special effects and action are very good as would be expected. Brendan Fraser and John Hannah work hard with a poor script. John Hannah is criminally underused, pushed completely to the sidelines and should have been omitted altogether rather than given this paltry amount of screen time. Michelle Yeoh also shines out, looking exceptionally well and a convincing actress too. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for Maria Bello. I like her as an actress and think she is quite talented, but in this movie she is dreadful. Her performance is completely forced and unconvincing. She just jars you out of the story. The chemistry between her and Fraser is also non-existent. The other stand out performance for all the wrong reasons is Luke Ford as Alex O'Connell, the Son. He is too smarmy and again a performance too forced, just trying too hard to be Rick O'Connell No. 2 instead of finding his own character.Has anybody else noticed that he looks only about 10 years younger than his parents? He is just too old to be the son of Fraser and Bello. In reality he is only 13 years younger than Fraser. What were they thinking? It just looks ridiculous and completely unbelievable. I know this is a Mummy movie and unbelievable goes with the territory but such blatant stupidity in casting is completely annoying and prevents you from immersing completely in the world of the Mummy.Overall this is an inane movie with a bad script, a criminally stupid plot and some terrible terrible casting. A total disappointment after the first two installments. Do yourself and your wallet a favor - DO NOT GO TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

Without the original Evie (Rachel Weisz), I found this movie to be missing one's of it's favorite characters. No dis-respect to Maria Bello, but the she just didn't capture my attention. I ended up imagining how Rachel would of said those lines during the movie. Also, the replacement for Alex (Luke Ford) was a terrible actor. Where was his accent?

It's the kind of movie you watch to relax and bring you back to childhood.I just found time to watch the movie yesterday and I must admit that it wasn't at all what I expected.The Terracotta warriors and China's first emperor (Jin and not Han like in the movie) had more depth than what was portrayed. The humor was dry and I felt that Fraser and Hannah's comedy wasn't put into good use.I found the actor who played Alex too old to be Rick's son. I would of course expect him to be older but somebody around the age of 16 - 18 would made it better. What ever happened to his English accent? The kid grew up in England for reality's sake!

480,kibeth-2,Huge disappointment,1,15 August 2008,"This movie sucks major big time. The script is utterly lousy. The characters are not the same characters I grew to love in the first 2 movies. There is NO chemistry between Brendan and the new Evy. The filming is disappointing. Wide shots might as well be photographs - nothing happens, no movement. Action shots are too close in so you can't see enough of what is going on. For instance, the sole fight scene between Michelle Yeoh and Jet Li is too close in. You can't see what these two martial arts experts are capable of. All you see is an occasional whirl of their arms, a twist of their torsos, and maybe a scowl if you're lucky. Legs and kicks don't come through because it's shot from the waist up, too close in. It lasts like 2 minutes - a real disappointment given what these two can really do. The plot has all this contrived, cutesy gook and sometimes it contradicts itself. This is a HUGE disappointment - a waste of money. No wonder Weisz saw fit not to sign up.

It was quite entertaining actually. Some of the ideas are clever such as having somebody living forever or a young boy dating a 2000 year old lady. The animation is good too. The dragon looks real, the snow ""big foot""'s facial expression are also lively. The historical context of the story was kept consistent with what are shown (such as dress, car, restaurant). It's an action-adventure type of movie but lot's of humor were added.Maybe too much humor. It could have been better, I agree, if the love story between the 2000 year old lady and the boy didn't come true. Anyway. Not too bad!",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

483,daggy_maggy,disappointing... simply disappointing...,3,29 August 2008,"Well, I saw The Mummy 3: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, and ultimately I was pretty disappointed with the actors, the corny plot development and its failed attempt to bring a fantasy concept and apply it in a semi-realistic, modern-day era. First off, the acting really didn't cut it for me. Simply, let me say that Brendan Fraser is better suited to less 'intelligent' roles, such as his stunt in George of the Jungle. His obnoxious, foghorn voice continually made me hope for his early death. Other than Fraser, the acting was pretty archetypical, including the kung-fu-fighting Asian girl who can be found in any one of the 100's of Hollywood fight-flicks we've seen in the last 20 years. On the whole, the acting was far unique, and basically made for a very predictable film.Second, the corny plot development is bad enough to make me cry. Wealthy mummy fighters, with a son, who is an explorer, and their paths cross (surprise surprise  they are father and son after all) and as the title would suggest, they must join forces to fight a mummy. This is just so unoriginal and so typical of this genre of film. As well as the poor plot, the cardboard characters leave the audience feeling as if they know exactly how the characters will behave, and how the movie will pan out, because we have seen all these stereotypical roles before. Finally, the movie has tried to unite a far too extreme fantasy concept with a 'realistic' depiction of the world. And this is the key area where the film has failed. The two concepts are in binary opposition for the duration of the movie, and ultimately it means the viewers cannot settle into either genre, and are left feeling awkward about the direction of the film. The Mummy 3 was quite a poor movie. It had its moments of humour, and some impressive visual effects, but on the whole, the actors, the weak plot, and the failed integration of fantasy and realism left a lot to be desired of this film. I am yet to see the Mummy 1 & 2 and after seeing this film, I'm not sure I want to.{[|(***)|]} - I give this movie three stars out of a possible ten. Dan",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

For a start, ITS NOT EVEN A MUMMY! They must use the word mummy about 5 million times in that film which gets annoying but the fact is, it ain't a mummy, he was stone or what-ever the terracotta army is made of...

Others, I will say fairly, are very good, but the bad ones are hard to ignore.Generally, I would not recommend this film.

490,crazyinsaneloser,this tomb should never have been opened,1,19 December 2008,"Alright then, luckily, I live TX where the cost of a movie at the theater is only $8. Unfortunately, my dad paid $5.40 to rent it from blockbuster because we missed it in the dollar movie - where it would have only cost us $1.25 - and I wouldn't have felt bad (AT ALL) about walking out of the theater. I didn't even realize that Rachel W. wasn't in this movie until I saw who they had playing Evie - to begin with I thought they had killed her off and this person was Rick's new wife, until they mentioned that Jonathan is her brother - I don't even think she was in the trailers. I applaud Rachel W. for backing out of this movie I got about 5 minutes in and said ""no wonder she's not in this one she must have read the script and realized how bad it would be."" Not to call Brennan Frazier an idiot - he's a brilliant actor and I love him in every other movie he's ever done - but he should have stayed out of this one. He and that poser they called Evelyn didn't have the same chemistry at all, Jonathan was still hilarious with his one-liners (though, that didn't completely make up for the fact that the movie just sucked), and if Brennan hadn't looked like he'd rather choke on a large watermelon the entire time it would have been a tiny bit better. Although, if people had realized how badly written the script was - and how poorly chosen some of the cast was - when they were filming it then they probably would have wound up with a better film or realized what a waste of time and money it was before allowing it to be copyrighted and shown to the general public.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
491,mullins-8,No Rachel ?,7,30 December 2008,"The movie is pretty good but the new Evelynn absolutely SUCKS HARDCORE! I would have rather they just left her character out of the movie altogether. Maybe have her out in Russia photographing Mammoth skeletons or something. In fact this would have been much better if it was just Branden and his son kind of thing. But the new Evelynn is seriously crappy. I couldn't get into her at all.The directors should have known this, and I blame them for being so damn stupid.The action scenes were great and the overall story line was a great idea, and very well executed. The sets were spectacular as well with great artifacts and reproductions. I particularly enjoyed the role of Evelynns brother and the fact he is somewhat wealthy and has kind of 'come into his own' was pretty cool. He deserves it. But the Evelynn thing really takes a lot out of the film. Rachel is cute, fiery and perfectly plays off of Brenden, but this new one is pathetic, motherly (not just to the son character but to Brenden) and 'oldish'.If they could not get Rachel in they should have left the Evelynn character completely out, or wait for Ms. Weisz to return to complete the film. Brenden should have known better as well. I am very disappointed.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
492,rogue_leader-1,"No where near as horrible as some say, but lacking in some areas....",6,1 January 2009,"As I stated in my summary, the movie was nowhere near as bad as some skeptics have commented, but yes it definitely was missing a few things. The most obvious & the one thing that stood out and aggravated me was the absence of Rachel Weisz. Rachel new the character well, and all Mummy fans have become acquainted with her style over the course of two films. I'm not saying that Maria Bello is bad actor, especially since I don't recall seeing any of her other movies, but for this film she just didn't fit. Changing actors/actresses in the middle of a franchise is just a stupid move if you ask me! The way Evie was played and no doubt written for the movie was too proper, too librariany. (Yes that's not a word) Rachel added that slight edge to Evie that made it believable she could beat the crap out of someone, which fits the role of a woman that Rick O'Connell would be interested in. And yes there wasn't a whole lot of chemistry between Bello & Fraser either, which is understandable after two movies with the same actress. And, again, yes I do have to personally agree that Rachel Weisz is hot! So maybe that biases me in Rachels' direction a bit. Also, I think they should have just gotten Freddie Boath to play Alex, and just set the movie the right number of years into the future to make it fit Freddies age.As far as the rest of the cast: Jet Li was awesome in this movie, but he wasn't given anywhere near the screen time as Arnold Vosloo. And in my opinion his character wasn't as, what's the right word, personified (?) in the script as Imhotep was. However, for what screen time he had Jet Li as usual performed superbly. The evil of the character was evident.Michelle Yeoh, as well as Isabella Leong both performed greatly, and I can find nothing to complain about with either actress. Character development on the part of the screenwriters could have been done a bit further and more screen time should have been allowed.John Hannah didn't miss a beat playing Jonathan Carnahan. While adding to the characters persona and not just repeating exactly what was done in the previous movies, he did leave the basis of Jonathan what it was. Self-serving playboy the better part of the time, under-the-table privateer, typically cowardly but with heroism waiting for a reason to lash out. Perfectly played.And as far as Brendan Fraser goes: Well done! Brendans' acting was excellent as he brought out the rough Rick O'Connell while balancing the emotions of a caring father & husband like in The Mummy Returns. As far as how his character was written I think it could have been done better. The attitude from the previous movies wasn't fully present in the dialogue of this movie, but again not Brendans' fault. He is well-suited for playing characters like Rick O'Connell, and has proved that throughout the series. So just to sum up; Brendans' performance was flawless. The script for him could have and should have been written better.As far as the plot goes there should have been more research I think. Maybe I'm just unfamiliar with Chinese mythology, but it seemed to me that there were several myths and legends tied together to make this movie. I hate that! Continuity is lost when that's done and it eats up screen time better used for the characters. The chase scene was a bit over the top. The chase scene from The Mummy Returns was fully believable. Okay, aside from the mummified royal guards with wolverine claws but you get what I mean. The chase sequence in this installment had too many ""holy crap that was lucky"" moments. And it was way too CG. Obviously some was necessary of course, but it was taken too far. And I don't recall as much on-site scenes like in the others. For example in The Mummy Returns (which ironically is showing on FX as I write this)you see a lot of footage from Egypt and the deserts. The whole river scene where Imhotep displays his powers for us, as another example. This adds much needed depth to a film, and wasn't as prominent with 3. Too, I thought the crystal thing ,I don't recall what it was called at the moment,that woke up Emperor Han: just a bit spacey if you ask me. And in my opinion they should have found Han right where he solidified. And his army was not under a roof when they turned to stone, but upon excavation they were, without explanation as to how they got there. Or at least none that I caught. Overall the plot, as well as the storyline could have been better. Also, with all the improvements in place, the movie should be longer. Epic movies seem to require at least 2.5 hours if not 3, for example Star Wars and Pirates. (Excellent franchises by the way) I give this movie a 6 out of 10. Overall I enjoyed the movie and am glad to own it. Brendan Frasers' acting coupled with Jet Lis' especially made up for any deficiencies within the movie itself. As well I was pleased with the visual effects.(Aside from the chase scene as already discussed) My advice for the next movie: Get Rachel Weisz back! And DO NOT touch the rest of the original cast. Develop the plot more, and base it solely on the legend you're working with don't cross over and link myths. Ensure there is adequate screen time for all actors, especially if the story revolves around them particularly. Oh, and move the O'Connells back to the house they were in before. The interior looked nothing like the one in The Mummy Returns.End of Line.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
493,angellove429,The worst movie,1,1 January 2009,"This movie should never have been made. It wrecked the mummy series for me. The ONLY good part of it all is that it had Brandon Frasier in it. It was poorly made, effects and casting was the worse. Racheal W. was smart in turning this film down. The Evelyn character should never have been done with out her. Bello tried to be Weiss and she did it poorly. Attempting to be exactly like another always flops.Save your money and go see another movie, this one will truly disappoint you and as for me I feel like I wasted time and money going and waiting in line to see it.

The movie was very choppy and seemed more fast paced than it should have been. It also wasn't as funny as the previous films. I also hate to say it but despite the fact that Maria Bello seemed to be a good actress I do not believe she was the right person for the role of Evelyn and that the writing of her part was totally different from the previous films. I had to pay $25 for the extended disc set since there weren't anymore of the standard disc and I wish I hadn't spent the money for it. I didn't get to see it in the theaters and boy am I glad.

Not only was the original Evie not present for the role, but the substitute for said role was possibly the most horrible replacement I've ever seen. I don't know what the director's intentions were for this, but if it were at all meant to truly accent the look, feel and presence of the Mummy series we love - epic fail.

I got turned off by the movie when i saw Maria Bello as ""EVERLYN"" she doesn't simply fit in to have a role as ""EVELYN"" my sister told me that the movie sucked so badly..she told me that she enjoyed the old Evelyn and that their son ""alex"" was too old... after i finished watching the movie i was so eager to search for the answer why Rachel Weiz didn't sign up for ""The Mummy 3"" and there it was i finally got the answer.. she didn't join because she didn't like the script! I guess people really didn't like the script at all! The best thing about the movie is the effects and he animals in the movie..:)) I also noticed the Brendon Fraser and Maria Bello had 0% CHEMISTRY! It also seemed that Brendon was very uncomfortable with Maria Bello... Maria Bello's accent is supposed to be like a ""BRISTISH"" person...she just can't fit in to be EVELYN. I want Rachel Weiz back!

Although the dates altered, it still didn't seem feasible to have a child of that age. Mind you her family must have travelled well, because I don't know if she noticed but her brother, ( played by John Hannah )has a strong Scottish accent.

507,wwechick1982,Don't judge a book by its cover...but do enjoy,9,5 August 2008,"So as of now, I've seen the Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor twice and I liked it the first time and I liked it the second time. I guess you could say that I'm not an intelligent moviegoer like the trailer for Brideshead Revisited says in the commercials, but I didn't know you had to be to enjoy the movie.The main complaint that I've heard from most people is the exclusion of Rachel Weisz as Evie and her replacement in Maria Bello. Someone on the message boards said that Bello didn't play Evie right, but the question is...is there supposed to be a right way to play her? Rachel Weisz put her own spin on it and so did Maria and neither woman was right or wrong in their interpretation of her. So to those of you who are complaining about Maria Bello....Y'ALL GET OFF HER BACK! There...I feel better now :) Jet Li doesn't have to say anything...he's scary as the Emperor and somehow even more scarier in terra cotta. As always, John Hannah is the comic relief and somehow he's gotten more funny as time as gone on, especially loved it when he became extremely close to the yak strangely named Geraldine. Now, I know I'm probably going to get a lot of flack for this, but I was extremely pleased with Luke Ford as Alex and I look forward to seeing if they continue on with the Mummy franchise. I agree I found it odd that he had an American accent but to each his own because I really wasn't focused on the accent(yes that is the girl in me....he's not bad to look at!).So I guess I should mentioned the star himself, Brendan Fraser, who did exactly what he did in the last two...he rocked 'em out! That might seem strange but again something that someone pointed out to me is that there was no chemistry between him and Maria Bello, but the problem is the script never called for it because its already been established that Rick and Evie love each other, so there are just trivial things that people pick on.The Mummy movies are there to entertain, they don't need the trivial complaints of people. Don't go into the movie comparing them to the former movies..just sit back and enjoy it and possibly forget for a moment that The Dark Knight exists(just kidding or am I?).",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

513,kcdctvd,Not as bad as they say,7,7 August 2008,"So before watching this movie, I have read a lot of terrible reviews for it. The bad word of mouth did not discourage me from seeing it; in fact, it made me even more curious to see this so-called abomination to cinema.The basic premise is a witch, Zi Yuan (played by Michelle Yeoh), was ordered by Emperor Han (Jet Li) to grant him immortality. Instead, she cursed him and his army when he killed her lover (played by the suave Russell Wong), turning them into terracotta statues. Fast forward centuries later, Rick and Evie (played by Brendan Fraser and Maria Bello) are now retired with an adult son (Australian actor Luke Ford). During one of his excavations, Alex located Emperor Han's tomb and brought it to Shanghai. Coincidentally, Rick and Evie were ordered to bring the Eye of Shangri-La to Shanghai so they ended up meeting Alex at Jonathan's (reprised by John Hannah) nightclub, ironically named Imhotep. Of course, Rick and Evie caused Emperor Han and his army to become resurrected and they must stop the cruel Emperor from taking over the world.I must admit, this movie has its flaws. One of the major ones were casting Maria Bello in the role of Evie. One of the reasons why I liked the previous Mummy movies so much were because of Brendan and Rachel's chemistry. In this movie, Maria and Brendan did not have the chemistry of a couple. They should have waited longer to make the movie since Rachel said she just gave birth and did not want to fly to China and leave her son. There were also rumors that Rachel did not like the script. The producers/scriptwriters should have altered the script because getting Rachel Weisz is worth it. Another flaw of the movie was casting Luke Ford as Alex O' Connell, Rick's son. First, Luke is too old to be Brendan's son. They should have casted a younger actor such as Shia LaBeouf (though he would probably be caught dead than do this movie) or Emile Hirsche even. Second, Luke is not a very good actor and he had no chemistry with Brendan. It was not a wise choice to focus on Alex's character so much in the movie. Lastly, how did Alex get an American accent when he's British? Even if he did study in the states, his accent should still be in tact. Ahhhh, the mysteries of Hollywood. The last flaw I want to point out is the movie's setting. I mean, China? When I think of Mummies, I think of Egypt, period. China is the un-mummiest place I could think of. It did not feel like a Mummy movie.Despite those flaws, this movie was consistent with the other Mummy movies for one reason: it was fun. Tomb of the Dragon Emperor was fast paced. There were lots of action (Maria and Brendan can kick ass) and funny moments. True, the dialogue was cheesy but I laughed at times. Throughout the whole movie, I was entertained. There was never a moment that I was bored. And I believe that's what a movie is all about.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
514,roeark,A loss,3,10 August 2021,"This movie suffered greatly with the loss of Rachel Weisz.

515,selkie1964,What a DOG!!!,1,6 August 2008,"I want to say up front that I loved the first two Mummy movies, so I am not a hater of this franchise. They were campy, very tongue-in-cheek, and there was this wonderful rapport between the actors which came out in their performances. I went into this one with some trepidation because much of the main cast of the first two films would not be in it (Rachel Weisz, Arnold Vosloo, Patricia Velasquez and Oded Fehr), but I figured, well, the first two were great (or at least a lot of fun), so how bad could this one be?Oh. My. God.!!! I am not exaggerating when I say that the best part of the movie was the Chinese-writing animation of the closing credits. Five minutes into the film I was cringingly embarrassed for the actors, and it only got worse. The only actor whose performance didn't suck a dead dog's butt was Jet Li, but only just -- he basically spent the whole movie yelling, killing people, and looking extremely cheesed off. There was no connection between his character and the audience. I mean, Imhotep (in the first two films) did evil things, but he had this romantic tragedy thing going on because he was in love with Anck Su Namun, and you could see some reason for his actions and you could even maybe sympathize with him a little bit (particularly at the end of ""The Mummy Returns"" when he realized that Anck Su Namun didn't really love him -- at least, not like Evie loved Rick -- and it had all been for nothing). He had a human quality, I guess. The Dragon Emperor, not so much. As far as anyone could tell, he was just a megalomaniacal twit with a world-domination complex -- there were no redeeming features in his character -- it was just a cardboard cutout of ""evil."" The only thing I have to say about the mother/daughter immortal protectors team is that even put together, they're no Ardeth Bay. Maria Bello was horribly miscast as Evie O'Connell. Her performance seemed clingy and desperate (not just Evie being clingy and desperate, but herself, Maria, the ""actress""). Luke Ford was a huge waste of space -- I never thought I'd see an ""actor"" who was worse at acting than Keanu Reeves, but Keanu Reeves is a great Shakespearean compared to Luke Ford. I echo another reviewer's comment in saying why didn't they just keep Freddie Boath? He's about the right age and he was actually funny in The Mummy Returns. Of course, it's probably better for his career that he *didn't* appear in this piece of trash (ditto Rachel Weisz, et al.) -- kudos to their agents for keeping them out of it. Brendan Fraser, whose performances I really enjoyed in the first two movies (although a great actor he is not), seemed like he was tired of the whole thing -- monumentally bored and just milking the franchise for another paycheck (I know that's a horrible thing to say, but I can't imagine why else the egregious performance -- I mean, you can only blame so much of it on the rotten script). John Hannah (another actor whom I usually really like) ditto. To paraphrase Mark Twain (from ""Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offenses""): the film-maker should make the viewer feel a deep interest in the people in the film and in their fate; he should make the viewer love the good people and hate the bad ones. But the viewer of ""The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor"" dislikes the good people in it, is indifferent to the others, and wishes they would all get drowned together.There was nothing even remotely funny about this movie -- the ""jokes"" (if you want to call them that) were either tired, stupid, or completely flat. The special effects couldn't make up for the mondo suckiness of this piece of... uh... ""film."" Even if they had been of the thrilling sort that one expects. Which these were not. The Yetis could have been cool, but they just, um, weren't. And the whole ""field goal"" thing was so NOT!I had to give this film a rating of 1 (awful) because that's as low as IMDb's scale goes, but I'd really like to give it something more like a 27. And I'd also really like a refund on the two hours of my life I wasted watching this dog. Boo! Hiss!! Yuck!!!",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
516,leslie-moss,Mummy needs to buried for good!,4,29 March 2012,"I enjoyed the first two installments of this franchise, but this last one was pretty bad. If you're gonna do a third installment, especially after two successful Mummy movies, you gotta do it right. This one felt forced and very much unlike the previous two Mummy movies.Mummy 3 reeks of Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull; much anticipated but ended up a disappointment. Mummy 3 moved away from its Egyptian roots into China (timing it right before the Beijing Olympics?), so the myth was pretty much gone and everything else felt staged and, well, boring.But it wasn't ALL that bad. Brendan Fraser is thankfully still spry enough to do his action scenes as adventurer Rick O'Connell. The CGI was good when the Eye of Shangri-la opened but everything else was pretty flat and didn't fit seamlessly with the rest of the scenes (such as when Emperor Han transforms). Rachel Weisz wisely didn't reprise her role as his wife Evelyn, and so the poor casting choice of the usually okay Maria Bello was saddled with the slack.Jet Li as the evil Emperor Han was mostly in terra cotta or CGI mode, so his charisma didn't really shine through, much like Michelle Yeoh as the good witch Zi Juan. John Hannah as Evelyn's opportunistic brother Jonathan Carnahan did not have enough witty lines unlike in the previous movies. Also surprising is the other casting conundrum of Luke Ford as the O'Connells' son Alex. He does look like Fraser, but he seemed too old for his still-young looking parents. Plus, he does not hold the same appeal as his younger incarnation in Mummy 2.They should've waited longer to produce a better script and stayed in Egypt in keeping with the franchise's theme.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
517,evangelicangel,Less than meets the eye,1,19 November 2008,"After watching 'Mummy 3', watch 'The Mummy', and you will quickly see the vast difference in the two.There are many elements that made the Mummy 3 a horrible edition to the Mummy series. Yes, the disappearance of Rachel was disappointing, but her presence wouldn't be enough to save this film from it's ultimate demise. Even Brendan Fraiser's character lost the edge many grew to love in the first two. The idea of the Terra-cotta was interesting, but not for this series. The story was poorly executed and almost over shadowed by the even more terrible ""romances"" between Luke, Lin, and the O'Connells. The random dialogue and forced chemistry was enough to make you sick. There was very little going for this movie, and I'm disappointed in this series being handed over to Rob Cohen. This was nothing short of a botched boob job.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
518,andyheong,Average but nothing great,5,31 July 2008,"I had great expectations for Mummy 3 being a fan of the first two movies. When it was release in Malaysia yesterday, I immediately went to catch the movie. I walked out with mixed feelings.On one hand, the special effects were lovely, it was action packed and one of my favorite actors (Anthony Wong from Hong Kong) was in the movie. But then, I never quite laughed at the jokes (in fact among the local Chinese audience, the fact that we laughed with surprise at Anthony Wong's being in the movie is indicative that the audience is not connecting with the jokes in the movie) and the chemistry between the lead actors were lukewarm. Especially unconvincing was the father/son relationship between Brendan Fraser and Luke Ford. Looking at Brendan Fraser and John Hannah, it seem like it was another day, another Mummy. Gone were the thrills, the enthusiasm and the fun from the first two movies.I won't call it a bad movie as it had its moments. But for me, its just another average big budget summer flick. Dark Knight really set the bar for this year's big release and this does not come close.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
519,ffalkec,Not good at all,2,13 August 2008,"Even though I was looking forward the new mummy, I must say, that after seeing it, I am very disappointed. Nothing like the first movie, at all. The story was simply stupid and predictable, the acting was catastrophic, the special effects were exaggerated,... I know it was never meant to be a Oscar winning movie, but they could (and should) had made a better story. I mean a little exaggeration is OK, but they went too far. If you are thinking of watching this movie, don't. Turn your TV on, watch whatever movie is on, it will certainly be better than this one. Or go out for a walk... At least you wont have a feelling that you just wasted 2 hours on a horrible movie...",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
520,coloradobloom,Worse than Awful,1,6 August 2008,"My son and I went to see Mummy 3 this evening; we both enjoyed the last Mummy film and are huge fans of Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh. The plot line had possibilities as did the special effects, but what a sloppy, childish, ridiculous script! The writers should be flogged! It was the worst movie I've seen in years. And what was up with Frasier's voice?? Reminded me of Batman's voice in the Dark Knight, so twisted. If you just have to see this movie, wait until it comes on TV for free. Maybe the editing required to fit in the commercials will improve it. Otherwise, you will be wasting your hard-earned cash.In general, it seems American-made movies are so predictable and pathetic. So many foreign films demonstrate a lot more respect for the audience and their ability to understand the plot without resorting to comic book one liners!",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
521,emperorcharming,10 years at IMDb.com... and this movie finally elicited my FIRST comment,1,10 August 2008,"A keen academic in the field of Egyptology, I watched the first two Mummy films with schoolboy interest; I was not disappointed.Thennnnnn, this film manifests itself in cinematic venues everywhere necessitating my patronage due to my loyalty to the franchise. I won't go into detail here, but I will say that 20 minutes into the film, I was falling asleep next to my girlfriend, and I could barely restrain myself from leaving the sparsely-packed theatre.Now, I've been a member of IMDb for over 10 years, and I haven't commented more than once, but this film warrants my first-ever negative post. Do not see this film. It has nothing to do with mummies, Egypt, or anything we all found so interesting world history class in primary school.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

Thankfully, I saw this film at home and was able to turn it off and walk away about 10 to 15 minutes into it.Anyone who wrote anything good about this film was either on drugs when they saw it, or is a studio plant, writing lies. I am giving the DVD to charity, though I honestly think it's mean to inflict this turd on anyone else.I honestly can't say I've ever seen a worse film, ever. Rachel Wise was the only smart one in the bunch, she turned it down. That should have been a big, fat, red flag. DON'T DO IT! Had I been at the theater, I would have asked for my money back. Sadly I can never get those minutes of my life back. If you haven't seen it, be glad.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

525,sball36,"Now, let's not be like mummies and play fair!",7,2 August 2008,"I am a big fan of the original - on of my all time favorites and enjoyed the second one- although it was a bit too frenetic. As for this movie, bottom line, its enjoyable. Here are my takes on the positives: Brendan Fraser, interesting premise, different exotic location, and the special effects. Now here are the negatives, of course we all miss Rachel as Evie, but Bello was okay except that she smiled too much. Rachel didn't smile for the sake of smiling. The main negative is that this movie loses the personal relationship between the O'Connells and the mummy. Although one could worry for the sake of the world, the conflict in the first 2 mummy movies was at a very personal level, and this is the most glaring omission for me. Secondly, there was vying between the father and son characters for the heroics. If any studio people read these posts. Brendan Fraster IS the franchise. No Brendan, no mummy movie for me. Overall, I left the movie entertained, but not elated.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
526,icyvirto,Worst movie to come out this summer,3,31 July 2008,"OK, so where to begin with this movie?It starts off with Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh having their own little back-story of the evil overlord trying to gain immortality and failing; leaving him mummified along with his army. A couple hundred years later Brendan Fraser reprises his role to return a valuable gem to Shanghai - only to find they've been tricked and Jet Li is revived with one goal on his mind... to become immortal and conquer the world.Now that I have the plot summary out of the way, let me tell you what I thought of it - not much. At all. The script is poorly written, with very little character development and a loosely constructed plot. The story is there more for explaining why everyone's in the same room rather than a driving point for the movie. It's full of weak points and unrealistic moments that made me cringe to begin with... then laugh out loud at how bad it was getting.To give you a few examples; there are yeti's in this movie that help our heroes, Jet Li turns into a 3-headed dragon, and, what I think is my new favourite quote ""'Your ass is on fire!', 'Spank it! Spank my ass!'"".If this kind of thing appeals to you, then go and watch it. If reading that made you say 'wtf' then you probably won't enjoy it.Brendan Fraser looked uncomfortable and had no on-screen chemistry with the rest of the cast. The CGI, although working hard at the nitty gritty seemed to miss the whole picture that (dare I say it) looked like it was from the 90's rather than the late 00's. Maria Bello delivers her lines with enthusiasm, but in a forced way as she tries to fill the moulded shoes Rachel Weiz left in the other 2 movies.Watching this movie made me realise that it had quite a bit of promise, but the poor writing and bad directing really took its toll.This movie is nothing like the other two, and don't expect it to be. I wouldn't watch it again in the cinema, and don't intend on buying a copy on DVD.The most interesting thing about this movie is thinking about how it could have been made better, and I must say it does cause quite a lot of conversation.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor

To give the cast the title of actors would be a breach of the trade description act. The film has all the wit and humour of a funeral on a gray January. The special effects would have been bad 50 years ago. This has to be one of the most miserable offerings ever made. I had to watch to the end to check that the awfulness was maintained throughout. You know when yo watch a film that is so bad it becomes good? This is not one such film. It is so bad that you will want to go and have your memory erased. Truly atrocious in every way.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
529,necdiva,"Reasons ""Emperor"" doesn't live up to its predecessors...",6,7 August 2008,"First, it doesn't have Rachel Weisz. Unlike others here, I think Maria Bello has loads of talent in the right role, but Evie is not the right role for her. Evie is a ""dame"", a throwback character, one of those 30s-40s women who is soft and feminine only on the outside, but made of steel underneath. Weisz captured this old-fashioned aura perfectly in the part; Bello cannot escape her contemporary roots as an actress, and although her British accent was mostly flawless, it seemed to get in her way as much as the role itself.Second, the first two films succeeded largely on the chemistry between Rick and Evie, and Brendan Fraser and Weisz. This was a couple you believed were passionately, obnoxiously, ""Get a Room, already"" in love. Bello and Fraser try, but the romantic chemistry just isn't there. I got the sense in this movie that Rick and Evie were good buddies, not long-time lovers still carrying a huge torch for each other.Third, Luke Ford was just wrong. Too old, and trying way too hard to ham it up the way Fraser does so effortlessly. At a minimum, the role of Alex should be played by someone younger. There is also the continuity problem of Alex now talking with an American accent where in the prior film he spoke the Queen's English.Fourth, the plot is just a rehash of the second movie, weakened by the fact that Jet Li is mostly wasted in the Emperor role. That said, this is still a film worth seeing--catch a matinée showing. It's fun, Fraser and John Hannah and Michelle Yeoh carry the movie just fine, the effects are fun and if you don't go in expecting too much, you'll have a good time.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
530,nettiejane-09213,Meh!,5,14 May 2019,I was very disappointed in this film. Was looking forward to watching another sequel to the Mummy but this movie falls flat.

Please do yourself a favor and don't spend any of your money to view it. The acting was bad, the script was bad, and the humor was meant for children who laugh at fart jokes. The only thing I enjoyed about the movie was my popcorn. The lead female character from the other movies was replaced by another actress, if you can call her an actress. The special effects weren't bad but it still didn't make up for the rest of it. Obviously the people who created the movie were just trying to cash in on the franchise but all they did was ruin it. Brendan Fraser I am disappointed in you. I haven't seen ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" yet but I'm hoping that you were working harder on that movie.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
532,crlorna,Sad Effort,4,1 August 2008,"Having just come out of the theater and seen The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, I definitely have some mixed feelings. Confusion, Embarrassment, and really big sense of What the @#%&?!? This movie truly had the opportunity to be great. The idea of the Emperor Qin Shi Huang's terra cotta warriors and horses, which actually were discovered buried in China, coming to life is a fascinating one and has the potential to be very entertaining.Unfortunately this movie does a terrible job at creating what could have been a very exciting adventure.First: I would like the mention the wardrobe department, they did a horrible job at portraying the time period in which this movie is supposed to take place, which is around 1945. There are scenes in which poor Brendan looked like a cartoon gangster from 'Cool World'. None of the attire seemed to fit the era and seemed to make a joke out of almost all of the characters.Second: There were huge gaping holes in the information given. If you are the type of movie goers who likes to know the how's and why's of things. This is definitely not for you.Third: Poor Brendan Frasier. This guy seems destined to be type-cast as the lovable goofy guy. There actually is a moment when you get to see his serious emotional side, but then they destroy this potentially moving exchange with corny jabbering. The whole movie seemed to be filled with corny over done jokes. I will say that Chinese actors Jet Li, Michelle Yeoh, and Isabella Leong did a wonderful job. They are about the only truly interesting actors in the movie. It's rather sad that their efforts were paired with such a dawdy display.Over all the movie was a very sad effort. It had the chance to be great, but really stumbled and fell at the door and just kind of rolled through in a heap. I must say as well that the original Evey is very sadly missed.One more question. How old are the O'Connell's supposed to be?!?! They look mid thirties, yet they have a philandering son that looks to be about twenty five.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
533,ChoirChica2000,Just bad.,2,30 July 2008,"I gave this movie a two rating instead of a one because it did manage to give me a few good laughs, but only because it was so bad. It really was just ridiculous. The characters' relationships were just awkward, and Fake Rachel Weisz was horrible! Just laughable, really, not only because of bad acting, but bad writing and a bad story. And, there were Yeti! Yes, Yeti. Jet Li also threw his face once or twice (literally, he pulled off his face and tossed it) then used fire to regrow it. I laughed out loud. I recommend it for a good laugh, but don't pay to see it before it hits dollar theaters (which should happen pretty soon) and don't expect anything like the first two. You will be sorely disappointed if you do.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
534,TRounder,Just a bad afternoon.,1,5 August 2008,"""The Yak, yakked"", says it all. The formula failed. This was a waste of 112 minutes. I wanted my discounted ticket price refunded. It's no wonder Rachel Weisz turned this one down, she has better taste. The whole thing gives B movies a bad name. There are actors who can speak ""comic book lines"" and there are actors who can't, this film was a mix of actors who could and actors who couldn't. Whoever cast Luke Ford will have to change their name and try a new career. As for Luke Ford...welcome to the Z list.Even the special effects could not keep the children in the auditorium awake. The dialog was some of the worst, maybe the worst ever written. If you like the other ""Mummy"" movies pass on this one, it's a bomb.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
535,Fatm39,Rachel Weisz couldn't have saved this film...,4,4 August 2008,"I went in to watch this movie not expecting much. I'm glad I wasn't. First off, the movie is very very very short! Not any action at all. Jet Li's role is tiny compared to Arnold's role in the first two mummy films. It doesn't even seem to have any Asian influence. In the past films you felt like you were in Egypt to some extent. If I didn't know this took place in China, I would have never guessed so. The CGI, it is OKAY at best...The snowmen, which were CGI, looked absolutely ridiculous. The film does have a bit of comic relief, though. The music was horrific, and seemed to add to the comedy-like qualities of the film. The bad thing is I don't think it was supposed to be a comedy. If you want to see this film, please wait until you are able to rent it. You will miss nothing seeing this on the big screen.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
536,ThereIsAlwaysMore,"Popcorn movie, nothing more!",6,15 January 2019,"In context, this review is of a viewing of the film on Netflix, so I did not pay a theater's price to view it. If I had, it probably wouldn't have been worth it. The plot is nothing new. It's basically a repeat of the first Mummy sans the love interest for the main bad guy.There's some fun action, some actually awesome settings, and some cool effects (though other effects look very dated). The dialogue is weaker than the previous two films, especially the comedic aspect which is, honestly, poorly done in this film. The score is also weaker than the first two films, though not by much (the score in the first two wasn't particularly amazing anyway).The casting of Maria Bello as Evelyn, isn't bad, but it is somewhat of a let down. It's not her fault at all though. It's just disappointing to have such a jarring change after the chemistry/relationship was built up between her character and Brendan Fraser's in the first two films. Luke Ford as their son is so-so.Overall, the film is nowhere near awful, but I don't think I'll be watching it again. I did enjoy most of it, but only moderately so. I'd only recommend this if you really enjoy action/adventure films with little to offer beyond eye candy and some cool set pieces.",The Mummy - Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
