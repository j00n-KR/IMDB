0,TheLittleSongbird,"Far from the best movie I have ever seen, but it is far from awful.",6,11 May 2009,"I liked this movie. Yes, the plot is predictable and weak, and in some cases over-familiar. Yes, the script is a bit weak in places. Yes, it is a little lacklustre, and doesn't quite capture the feel good nature of the show. But it is far from the worst movie ever. I really don't know what people were thinking when they gave this film such a low rating. Some of the worst movies I've ever seen, are Home Alone 4, Thomas and the Magic Railroad, Cat in the Hat, Disaster Movie, Epic Movie, Pokemon the First Movie and Batman and Robin, but this film doesn't deserve to belong to this category. On the most part, due to the enthusiastic performances of the cast, it was quite entertaining. John Goodman was born to play Fred. He looks the part, and put a lot of much-needed enthusiasm into the role. Rick Moranis is fine as Barney, very like what I imagine him. The prequel is probably better, but Mark Addy and Stephen Baldwin don't quite fit the bill as Goodman and Moranis. I also liked Elizabeth Perkins and Rosie O'Donnell as Wilma and Betty. As the villains, Kyle McLachan and Halle Berry play their clichéd characters more than adequately. I do miss Elizabeth Taylor when she was pretty, but she was game as Wilma's mother, though not quite in the same league as Joan Collins in the prequel. The sets and costumes are spot on, and the design of Dino was superb. All in all, I liked this movie, it's not perfect, but it is far from the worst movie I have ever seen. 6/10 Bethany Cox.",The Flintstones
1,SnoopyStyle,Too serious,5,14 September 2013,"When Fred (John Goodman) gets promoted, evil sleazy executive Cliff Vandercave (Kyle MacLachlan) sees a stupid patsy to take the blame for his embezzling scheme. First Fred is forced to fire Barney (Rick Moranis), then the rest of the employees. Then he signs all kinds of memos without reading them. It all comes back to haunt him when the embezzling comes to light.This is a live action take on the classic cartoon. I actually like the visual styles. It's got the crazy rock look. But they needed more colors and brighter colors. The story is too serious. Not only is there scheming, but also fighting, firing people, money troubles and kidnapping. It's a children's cartoon. There is too much danger especially for the kids. It needs to be much lighter.",The Flintstones
2,kosmasp,If you love the animated series ...,8,31 May 2021,"... you will certainly like this one too! John Goodman is spot on! Generally speaking a lot of the casting seems to have been great to say the least. It's been a while since I saw the show, but it all feels good and apt to me. The story may be predictable, but this is really good fun you can have ... and who can say no to Halle Barry .. no matter the season, age or time frame she is in.So while you can have fun with this, I understand if you think this is flawed ... because let's keep it real it is. But the charisma of everyone involved and the obvious fun they had doing this movie make this an almost perfect family movie! Don't be grumpy, join the fun!",The Flintstones
3,lee_eisenberg,No-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!,1,27 February 2006,"WHOSE DASTARDLY, INBRED IDEA WAS THIS?!!!!!!!!! I've heard of despicable adaptations, but ""The Flintstones"" is a level all on its own! Featuring Fred (John Goodman) becoming an executive while slimy deals are going on, the movie makes you feel like you died and went to the hottest part of Hell. Worse still, this God-awful excuse for a movie started a trend of dreadful movie adaptations of TV shows: ""Mission: Impossible"", ""Lost in Space"" (although the show apparently sucked to begin with), ""The Avengers"", ""The Mod Squad"", ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"", ""Scooby Doo"", ""I Spy"", ""The Honeymooners"" (although the show apparently sucked to begin with) and ""Bewitched""; it's a pure fluke that the movie versions of ""The Addams Family"", ""The Beverly Hillbillies"", ""The Brady Bunch"" and ""Charlie's Angels"" were worth watching (although the same can't always be said for sequels: my dad saw ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"" on an airplane and called it one of the ten worst movies that he'd ever seen). To add insult to injury, there was that ""Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas"" (which, thankfully, I never saw); John Waters's ""Cecil B. Demented"" made a joke about it.All in all, this just may be the worst movie ever. I know that it's hard to say, given that there are so many bad movies, but it's certainly up there. They wasted the talents of Goodman, Elizabeth Perkins, Rick Moranis, Rosie O'Donnell, Halle Berry, Kyle MacLachlan, and Jonathan Winters. And how did Elizabeth Taylor end up this swill? Not that she was one of the greatest actresses to begin with.In conclusion, I hear that they're making a ""Get Smart"" movie with Steve Carell. I guess that we should keep an open mind, but there's more reason to be suspicious than to be anticipatory. And furthermore, THERE HAD BETTER NOT BE MOVIE VERSIONS OF ""I Love Lucy"", ""Mister Ed"", ""Gilligan's Island"", ""I Dream of Jeannie"", ""The Flying Nun"", ""All in the Family"", ""Sanford and Son"", ""Happy Days"", and ""Three's Company""! At least ""The Andy Griffith Show"" and ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" are named after people, and thus can't get all fouled up on the silver screen.",The Flintstones
4,jboothmillard,The Flintstones,4,14 July 2005,"This is the live action film of the popular Hanna Barbera cartoon about the stone age family. There is not that much good comedy, it is more emotion and family based, but it is quite good for some reasons. John Goodman plays Fred Flintstone, husband and father of the famous stone age family. He is exactly as ignorant and fat as the the cartoon version. Elizabeth Perkins plays Wilma Flintstone, she is quite pretty, but she is not as worrying as the cartoon version. Honey, I Shrunk the Kids' Rick Moranis plays the cartoon's best character Barney Rubble. He is giggly and a bit dumb, not quite as good as the cartoon though. And Rosie O'Donnell as Betty Rubble is just not right, she is meant to be thin and attractive, not fat and quite loud. Also starring Kyle MacLachlan as Cliff Vandercave, Halle Berry as Sharon Stone (probably meant to be irony, but they did originally want the actress of the same name), Elizabeth Taylor as Pearl Slaghoople and Richard Moll as Hoagie. Not all people who loved the cartoon show would bother with this, but it is still quite fun for the family. Halle Berry was number 99, and Dame Elizabeth Taylor number 77 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Taylor was also number 11 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, and she was number 7 on Britain's Finest Actresses. Okay!",The Flintstones
5,ccthemovieman-1,Better Than The Animated Series,7,12 March 2007,"The Flinstones This is what you'd call a ""cute"" movie, the cuteness mainly being the funny takeoff on objects, such as regular household appliances, that you see in here caveman-era-style. Most of those are prehistorical creatures having to perform the tasks of cleaning, but they are clever and funny to watch. In fact, there are so many of them it's tough to catch all of them. It would take a number of viewing to fully appreciate all the visuals in here.When I first saw this, I expected a really stupid movie. I had enjoyed but not been a big fan of the animated ""Flintsones"" series on TV, and thought this would be more of the same except with real actors. Actually, it was much better and had a surprisingly good cast for such a lightweight cartoon comedy.I mean, who would expect a big star like Elizabeth Taylor to be in this movie? She had the funniest lines, too, I thought. Her put-downs of poor ""Fred"" (the rotund John Goodman is perfectly cast) included lines such as, ""the only good thing you provide for my daughter is shade."" This is quite an eclectic cast with the likes of Taylor, Goodman, Rick Moranis, Rosie O'Donnell, Elizabeth Perkins, Kyle MacLaughlan and Halle Berry.As for the kids, there is no language problem in here, although they inserted the obviously- and-purposely misspelled word, ""fuk"" on a headline in a newspaper Fred was reading. (Hollywood just can't help itself.)",The Flintstones
6,moonspinner55,"A hearty attempt, but it just doesn't work...",5,6 October 2002,"Live-action adaptation of Hanna-Barbera's TV cartoon brings prehistoric blue-collar family man Fred Flintstone to life with the help of John Goodman, exceptional in the role. The world of Bedrock is excitingly captured, all the surrounding details look right, but unfortunately the script is a pale, shapeless mess. Also, who cast Rosie O'Donnell as neighbor Betty Rubble, the Snow White of the Sabertooth set? O'Donnell is far too brash and distracting as Betty, who was mostly around in the TV show as a foil for Fred's wife Wilma (adequately played by Elizabeth Perkins). O'Donnell should have instead played Fred's mother-in-law, although Elizabeth Taylor is game for this loudmouthed harridan. There are some laughs here--although not big ones--while the ""plot"" is weaker than any of those written for television. ** from ****",The Flintstones
7,Quinoa1984,I guess it's fair,5,30 September 2000,"I saw this film again on TV one night, and while it looks entertaining for kids, adults will want to reckon back to the days of the TV show (or maybe just the Honeymooners).  The actors are somewhat credible here, with Rick Moranis always getting some laughs as Barney, but hey, that might be it here.  Not great, but  it is a whole lot better than the sequel at least.

8,studioAT,The Flinstones go live action,4,8 January 2017,"Somewhere along the line there must have been a fascination to see what would happen if cartoons were turned into live action films. That must be the reason we ended up with Popeye (with Robin Williams) and this take on 'The Flinstones' with John Goodman.It's actually a successful attempt, and the film remains a regular fixture on TV. There are enough little nods to the cartoon, while a feasible story is being told.Goodman is better as Fred than Moranis is as Barney, but there's enough sweetness to keep this film on track.Nothing will top the cartoon, but this is an honest attempt.",The Flintstones
9,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Just when you thought your childhood memories were safe...,5,17 December 2004,"Is Hollywood ever going to stop remaking old classics, or turning old cartoons into live-action films? I was never a big fan of The Flintstones, but the show did have charm, and was decent children's entertainment. This doesn't, and it isn't. The film starts off with a poorly acted scene that acts as a prologue to the film itself and sets the tone nicely. That means that if you're considering watching this movie, just watch the scene preceding the credits and you can make up your mind on whether or not you want to sit through the rest of this. It acts as a fair warning to even the most overbearing parent. As soon as this scene is over, we get a live-action version of the famous and well-known intro to the TV-series which will make even the most mentally hardened die-hard fan break down in tears and yell ""Please make it stop! Oh my gosh!"" at the screen. The film ends with a live-action re-enactment of the end credits sequence of the show as well, which most likely will bring forth the same reaction. I'm not going to lie to you; I didn't pay that much attention to the film. It might have been because I saw it once when I was a kid (almost ten years ago). But, more likely, it was just because it was really dull and downright offensive to anyone who is/was a fan of the show, even slightly, or anyone who actually does demand just a little quality from a film they watch. It's so tacky and crude. Honestly, I couldn't tell you one single joke or gag from the movie, and I've just seen it. My mind, my very subconscious represses it, pushes the memory of the film away from the surface... and you know what? I'm thankful for that. No one should have to see this film. No one. It might have a good effect as a torture device, but that's it. Now, to break it down just quickly for you: The plot is dull, pointless, completely predictable(in fact, almost painfully so). The pacing is awful. For a movie that's only 90 minutes, it certainly felt much, much longer. The acting isn't all bad, but it certainly isn't impressive. The characters are cheap clichés and stereotypes, mere cardboard cutouts of their characters from the original TV-series. The special effects are so see-through and poorly done that you have to wonder what the heck the film-makers were thinking... if they were thinking at all. Maybe that's it. They slept through the whole thing, and wound up with a bunch of finished film, had it edited by a man with two broken arms and sent it off to the cinemas. I recommend this film only to children, as no adult could possibly be forgiving enough and so indifferent to quality that he or she could actually enjoy even part of this film. 5/10",The Flintstones
10,view_and_review,Sideways Thumb,5,9 August 2020,"Monetarily ""The Flintstones"" can't be called anything but a success, but truthfully it is floptastic. We're 26 years removed from the release of ""The Flintstones"" so I wonder how many seeing this review even watched the cartoon the movie is based upon. I had my daughter watch ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and she didn't recognize any of the Looney Tunes characters.""The Flintstones"" movie just fell flat. The jokes, the plot, the attempts at cartoonizing a live action movie. Today we have the benefit of excellent CGI to cartoonize live action movies, but the best course of action would have been to leave off the cartoonish actions.The plot was a simplistic one. Cliff Vandercave (Kyle MacLachlan) and the sexy Sharon Stone (Halle Berry) were plotting to steal millions of clams (dollars) from Slate Co. and they needed a patsy to blame. Who better than the dimwitted Fred Flintstone (John Goodman). After a company-wide aptitude test in which Barney Rubble (Rick Moranis) switched his test with Fred, Fred was offered a VP position. Patsy acquired.It was clear that the movie tried to appeal to both kids and adults alike. I'd say that it failed at both. It wasn't storm-out-of-the-theater bad, but it certainly got some eye rolls. I wouldn't put both thumbs down--maybe one down and one sideways.",The Flintstones
11,neil-476,Decent live action adaptation,7,18 July 2015,"Fred Flintstone is promoted to vice-president in order to serve as an unwitting patsy for a fraud, and it costs him his lifelong friendship with Barney Rubble.This film exists in order to bring to life all the anachronistic gags from the TV series, and it does this very well - the iconic title sequences, in particular, are recreated with loving accuracy. Of course, a film needs rather than that in order to sustain 2 hours' running time, and here we have a story of corporate skulduggery with a subtext about the value of friendship. It is perfectly adequate as a basis for the visuals.Because Bedrock is just about perfectly realised, and the casting is very nearly spot-on, too - only Rosie O'Donnell comes across as a little too brash and robust for Betty. The playing is broad, but it needs to be.This is a fun family film, but it will mean rather more to those who grew up with the TV cartoon series.",The Flintstones
12,anaconda-40658,Yubba Dubba Don't See It.,3,19 June 2015,"The Flintstones (1994): Dir: Brian Levant / Cast: John Goodman, Elizabeth Perkins, Rick Moranis, Rosie O'Donnell, Elizabeth Taylor: Here is a huge opportunity to create movie magic and instead a celebrated cartoon is turned into a pathetic showcase. It is claimed that over thirty writers were assigned to the screenplay but I have read instruction booklets that regarded how to put batteries in appliances that were more artistic than this film. Fred Flintstone assists his friend Barney Rubble in adopting Bam Bam and he repays him by switching aptitude tests that will determine who will be Vice-President at Slate Enterprises. This leads to a conspiracy that costs workers their jobs and has Fred on the run. Horrible translation by director Brian Levant whose best asset is the prehistoric production. The screenplay throws in aptitude tests, embezzlement, office politics, fraud, and adoptions that will not interest the intended audience. With that said the characters are given little of a plot. John Goodman and Elizabeth Perkins give it a welcome attempt as Fred and Wilma, but Rick Moranis fails to project Barney's mannerisms, and Rosie O'Donnell hardly looks like Betty although she did deliver on the famous giggle. Elizabeth Taylor as Fred's mother-in-law is another horrible miscast. Thirty writers could not prevent this from becoming an embarrassing prehistoric failure. Score: 3 / 10",The Flintstones
13,HotToastyRag,A perfect movie,10,19 July 2017,"If there's such a thing as a perfect movie, The Flintstones is it. It's absolutely hilarious, with no downtime and no dated jokes. If you've seen the original Hanna Barbara cartoon, you'll probably pee from laughing so hard, and if you haven't, well, you'll still probably pee from laughing so hard. I saw this movie in the theaters when I was a little girl and laughed my head off, thinking it was the first movie to ever make caveman jokes. Just last week, I watched my DVD for the hundredth time and laughed just as hard.John Goodman as Fred Flintstone, Rick Moranis as Barney Rubble, Elizabeth Perkins as Wilma, and Rosie O'Donnell as Betty are all totally perfect. The original song is included at the start and end of the film, and all the throwbacks to the cartoon are side-splittingly funny. Modern touches are incredibly clever and tie in seamlessly to the setting. For example, the Flintstones go to the drive-in movies to watch ""Gorge Lucas's Tar Wars"", and the band The B-52s guest star in a swanky nightclub as ""The BC-52s"".In the film, Fred and Wilma help their best friends adopt a child, and in return, Barney helps Fred get a promotion at work. But, as the incredibly dumb Fred moves up the corporate ladder, he just might get duped by the slippery smooth Cliff, played by Kyle MacLachlin, and his secretary, a young Halle Berry who gets her own theme music whenever she walks in the room.It's silly and lovely, and best of all, Elizabeth Taylor puts the finishing touch on the film in her role as Wilma's mom. It's my favorite of her performances; pretty much every one of her lines has become a permanent phrase in my household. If only she'd been given more screen time! But, as she says in the movie, ""Let's not let a little thing like that spoil the party—Conga line!""",The Flintstones
14,FlashCallahan,Have a Yabba Dabba Doo Doo time.....,3,1 December 2012,"Fred and Barney work at Slate and Company, mining rock. Fred gives Barney some money so he and Betty can adopt a baby. When Fred and Barney take a test to determine who should become the new associate vice president, Barney returns the favour by switching his test answers for Fred's, whose answers aren't very good. Fred gets the executive position, but little realises that he's being manipulated by Cliff Vandercave to be the fall guy for an embezzlement scheme.....As soon as the credits roll, you know that the makers are really trying too much to entertain the adults as much as the kids, and when Berry introduced herself as Sharon Stone, I gave up.It is faithful to the cartoon, and to be fair, the effects and the references to the cartoon are wondrous, and Bedrock really does come alive on the screen.Goodmaen is way over the top, but I don't believe there is any other way. The rest of the cast are just there, but Moranis is great and really shines in this.The plot is simple and straight forward, and it's as predictable as alway, friends fall out, argue for a while, hero gets the blame, every one hates him for a while, come the end, everyone is happy.It's not good, and it's not clever, just a tirade of product placement and silly references to adults.That made me grimace rather than smile.",The Flintstones
15,Wuchakk,The animated show comes to life with John Goodman in the lead role,9,12 June 2015,"While critics love to bash this live-action cinematic version of ""The Flintstones"" and the rating here at IMDb is surprisingly low, the movie was a huge hit in 1994 and fittingly so because this is a great movie for what it is. Speaking of which, this explains why ""The Flintstones"" is such easy prey to incessant panning – it's a movie based on a cartoon. So freaking what? The question is, does it work for what it is and the answer is a resounding ""yes""! Movies should be critiqued and graded according to what they are and aspire to achieve. For instance, ""Godzilla"" is a colossal-creature movie and should be reviewed on that level. Compared to the original ""Apocalypse Now"" it's dreck, but how does it stack-up to other gigantic-monster movies? It's the same thing with ""The Flintstones."" Roger Ebert criticized the film on the grounds that ""the story is confusing, not very funny, and kind of odd, given the target audience of younger children and their families. Do kids really care much about office politics, embezzlement, marital problems, difficulties with adoption, aptitude exams and mothers-in-law?"" For one thing, the film IS funny if you're familiar with The Flintstones and, more so, if you're a fan, which I am. I've seen the movie four times now and, without exception, laughed from beginning to end. Now the laughs may be more giggling at silly humor than uproarious laughter, but laughing nonetheless. As for the criticism that the story's confusing and misses the supposed target audience because of adult-oriented elements, this just shows that the ""target audience"" wasn't just kids. ""The Flintstones"" is for kids AND adults equally, which was true of the original cartoon as well, but more so with the movie, and I'm glad. The live-action version of ""Dudley Do-Right"" (1999) made the mistake of aiming solely for kids – real little kids -- and it seriously bombed and justifiably so because it's a complete dud. It's impossible to watch that movie as an adult and stay interested. ""The Flintstones"" doesn't make this mistake and that's why it was such a hit and remains thoroughly entertaining to this day.The cast is great, even Rosie O'Donnell as Betty (who I didn't think would work), but John Goodman as Fred is so good it's like the cartoon come to life! Furthermore, the sets and F/X are top-of-the line and surprisingly hold up to this day. In addition, the story has warmth and offers realistic and worthy themes. Take, for instance, Fred and Barney's bond. They're best friends and their personalities balance each other out. You'll see this in real life. My best friend, for example, is similar in some ways to Barney while I more fit the Fred role.The bottom line is that ""The Flintstones"" is entertaining from beginning to end for all the reasons noted above and it wisely doesn't overstay its welcome at 91 minutes.The film was shot at Vasquez Rocks, Santa Clarita and Sun Valley, California, and Snow Canyon State Park, Utah.GRADE: A",The Flintstones
16,StevePulaski,"""A live action ""Flintstones"" movie"" - find the flaw in that sentence",3,29 September 2012,"I will confess and say that I was never a fan of the original Flintstones cartoon. I'm usually the one to jump on board and support poorly animated shows from the dawn of animated programs, but The Flintstones never resonated to me as anything more than a one note joke breathlessly carried out for an overwhelming one hundred and sixty-six shorts. Its setups were tired, its jokes cliché, and its characters bland and one dimensional.The film adaptation is more of the same, with one gleaming flaw from the start; its live action transfer. May I ask why? Why does the film industry continue to force programs that were born to be animated into the live action format. A way to save money is my only guess. But if you would stick to the old animation, wouldn't more people show up? Bottom line; The Flintstones was cheesy and completely cartoony with its slapstick, its ridiculous use of dinosaurs and prehistoric lifeforms as common household appliances, and its more subtle quirks that made the show memorable. All of those worked because it was all animated - you could never envision this happening in real life. Why would you want to? Our story begins with Cliff Vandercave (Kyle MacLachlan) discussing to a co-worker how he plans to take over the company Slate & Co. by looking like he is working hard on improving it while he is simultaneously shafting it out of much-needed cash. He plans on using Fred Flintstone in order to carry out this plan. Fred is played by John Goodman and his best pal Barney is played by Rick Moranis. To be fair, both men inhabit their roles nicely. Goodman is the go-to man to play Fred and while Moranis seems to not be built like the cartoon Barney, one must recognize that he does a faithful job at bringing the character to life.The same can be said for Elizabeth Perkins, playing Wilma, Fred's long-suffering wife, but the same can not be said for the woefully miscast Rosie O'Donnell as Betty, Barney's wife. One look at the cartoon Betty and Rosie O'Donnell and the resemblance is far beyond distant.Basically, Fred gets appointed the honorable job of being the vice president of Slate & Co. and it comes as no surprise that he lets the power get to his head and shortchanges his best friend Barney which starts by firing him. From there, it's all cliché best friend breakup arguments, tired sight gags, and a helluva lot of unfunny rock puns.The set design, at first, is welcoming and nice to look at. But after ninety long minutes of staring at rock buildings, CGI dinosaurs, and poorly crafted slapstick jokes, the endeavor goes from welcoming to downright bloated. The CGI, just as well, is uninspired, especially on Dino, who goes down as one of the most incessant and unnecessary characters of this decade. He's buffoonish, annoying, and transfers about as well to the big screen as Scooby-Doo did in 2002.The Flintstones is a rather monotonous adventure, much like how the show was. Its jokes become stale too quickly, its premise is dated (not pun intended), and even the slightly humorous little tidbits such as the creatures of Bedrock working as household appliances becomes unfunny because of the way they look in the film. Also, the film's concern with plot points that are likely not appealing to kids (or even adults in that respect) can't rebound the film's already ridiculous setup and ideas.Starring: John Goodman, Rick Moranis, Elizabeth Perkins, Rosie O'Donnell, and Kyle MacLachlan.

17,Smells_Like_Cheese,"I had fun, enjoy this for what it is, we don't get many family films like this any more",7,3 April 2004,"The Flinstones, next to The Simpsons, it's one of the best known animated shows of all time, we all know the name Fred Flinstone. It's such a great series, I grew up watching it, I still will catch an episode or two on the Cartoon Network and I'm sure it's something that my children will watch too one day. So in 1994, we had the live action version of The Flinstones come into theaters, my family took me to see it, I was 9 years old, it was either this or Pulp Fiction, I'm sure my parents didn't struggle much with that decision. But still as a kid I absolutely loved this movie, I think I wore out the VHS quite a bit. So I grew up and of course caught the movie on HBO, I figured that I would just give the movie another shot to see if it was still as fun as I remembered and actually I still love it.Cliff Vandercave, the Executive Vice President of Industrial Procurement at Slate & Co., plans to appoint a Vice President of his division to frame for a crime. To find one, he makes an exam to give to the quarry operators, among whom are Barney Rubble and Fred Flintstone. Fred loans Barney money so he and his wife, Betty can adopt a child. They adopt a caveboy named Bamm-Bamm. Barney appreciates what Fred did for him and is determined to pay him back. While taking the exams, Fred fails it, and is disappointed since he will not be able to give his wife, Wilma the wealthy life she used to have. Barney takes Fred's exam up for him and notices how poorly he did. To pay him back for giving him the money to adopt Bamm-Bamm, he swaps his exam with Fred's and Fred is promoted to Vice President. Cliff orders Fred to fire Barney because of his exam score, and he fires Barney at the Rubbles' surprise party, but does his best to help Barney afterwards with financial problems. But Cliff still has big plans to set Fred up for a big fall and the Rubbles are starting to get sick of the Flinstone's over the top extravagances.Honestly, I really did enjoy The Flinstones as much as I did when I was a kid, I know the main reason a lot of people complain about this movie is because of the casting, but even with Rosie O'Donnell in it I thought she was adorable, we had a great cast, everyone has their own ideas, but just deal with it and understand who this movie was made for. Granted as an adult I'm not going to go out of my way to watch this movie by myself, but I still wouldn't mind at all showing this to my younger cousins and watching it with them. It has cute jokes, a fun cast, and a good story with tons of fun sets and props. I would recommend this movie to watch with your family if you get the chance, it's a rockin' good time.7/10",The Flintstones
18,ElMaruecan82,Stone-age fun that won't leave you stone-faced...,7,7 July 2018,"There's one thing the lyrics get right: The Flintstones are the modern stone age family, ""modern"" underlined.Indeed, the iconic family from the town of Bedrock set all the standards of TV sitcoms decades before ""The Simpsons"". Fred Flintstone, originally a variation of Jackie Gleason in ""The Honeymooners"" became the staple of all TV everyday American fathers, big-sized, big-hearted but of average intelligence guys who drink beer, go bowling buddies and of course, make us laugh.Speaking of big and jovial, remember that bus scene in ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" where Steve Martin who was playing a stuck-up and sinister businessman was asked to pick a song. His choice was rather uninspired as ""Three Coins in the Fountain"" only garnered awkward silences... until John Candy caught up by singing the ""Flintstones"" theme and the whole bus sang in unison, and you could even hear the iconic ""Wilma!"" at the end. That's how popular the show was to a whole generation of adults and kids in 1987... and I could have picked another example such as ""The Simpsons"" hilarious parody in the ""Monorail"" episode, if it wasn't for Fred, there would be no Homers.Technically and visually, ""The Flintstones"" wasn't exactly a landmark of animation but it was a game-changer because as a cartoon with the appeal of a TV series and whose years of re-runs consolidated the legacy. People enjoyed the plots as well as the animation, maybe more. Personally, I've never been a fan of Hanna-Barbera 60s/70s cartoons but ""The Flintstones"" (and to a lesser degree, ""The Jetsons"") is one of the rare peaks of animation reached at a time where minimalist UPA and TV politics had killed off all the charm and visual quality inherited from the Golden Age. So in the early 90s, everyone had grown up with the TV program and would mostly associate prehistoric times with funny people dressed in cavemen's clothes, driving cars with their feet and having dinosaurs or animals as pets or household objects.The cartoon's secret was to have all these elements used as peripheral gags or props to establish the environment while the episodes, as I remember ,were consistent enough to sustain a half-an-hour format and mature enough to attract adult audiences. I was often surprised by the show's length but I guess that's the reason why it was the last one aired on Cartoon Network before the torch was passed to TNT. That mix of cartoony elements and adult-related themes made it a fitting transition. And this is why I believe the movie adaptation does justice to the cartoon because the central character is the everyday man caught up in situations adults can relate to, bonding with friends, being promoted, handling a sexy secretary and spiteful mother-in-law etc. 
Roger Ebert praised the visuals but criticized the plot, a Razzie-nominated screenplay with as many writers as extras in ""Gandhi"". Okay, it might not be the script of the year but I don't know what he exactly expected as a more kid-oriented family film. Surely dealing with aptitude tests, mechanization, adultery and adoption isn't exactly the themes children expect in an animated movie, but first of all, most fans were all grown-ups and secondly, the film contains so much slapstick and visual delights that I can't imagine kids yawning in the theater. The balance doesn't always work and there are many overly dark and sexy moment t but Ebert's criticism echoed a similar complaint he had about ""The Lion King"" which was too dramatic for children and dealt with Shakespearian themes such as succession, tribalism and honor that might get over the heads of the little ones. But now, it's regarded as a classic, and given how many cartoons patronize children with their marketing-oriented themes, ""The Flintstones"" has aged unexpectedly well. Sure, we're all blasé about live-action remakes but it wasn't yet a trend in the 90s and CGI effects were still getting warm with ""The Mask"" or ""Jurassic Park"". For all its computer imagery, the film strikes for its great practical effects, a rock can look phony but never fake. And there's John Goodman's performance carrying the film like a huge boulder and he's so good I can't believe he was snubbed by the Golden Globes. If Jim Carrey is nominated for ""The Mask"", there's no reason to overlook Goodman who doesn't impersonate a cartoon character but appropriate him so well that we can't separate between the two. He's over the top enough to remind us of Fred but human enough to fit a live-action format. Rick Moranis is perfect as Barney Rubble, his long-suffering friend, and Elizabeth Perkins does a goof job as Wilma. Kyle McLachlan and Halle Berry plays the villainous scheming duo and you can tell how much fun they had playing their roles, as Berry points it out, she was bad, but she was so good at it.The real problem was the casting of Rosie O'Donnell and I feel almost guilty because apart from her look, her performance didn't ruin the film. The problem is that Betty Rubble's beauty is as much a defining trait as Fred's orange suit, Rosie O'Donnell isn't ugly but isn't exactly the first beauty to come to your mind. It was distracting and became one of the most notorious cases of miscasting. Another misfire was the unnecessary kidnapping of the children, till now, the scream of Little Pebbles in that wagon seems out of place. Apart from that, the film was good enough to garner more awards, it was overdue a special effects Oscar nomination or set-designs. As for the critics who thought kids wouldn't actually understand or enjoy the plot, I guess the plot of the film itself teaches a good lesson to those who're too eager to underestimate one's lack of intelligence. The film is certainly not flawless, but it's entertaining, fun and aged better than expected. And who can resist to the sight of Liz Taylor forming a Konga line with a caveman and a pet-dinosaur?",The Flintstones
19,lesleyharris30,"An Older Audience That Grew Up With The Flintstones Wont Be Impressed,",5,24 April 2013,"The Flintstones is a decent movie with a surprisingly clever story line,but only a alright cast,and most of them don't really relate to the characters their playing.If you grew up with the Flintstones,like myself,you will definitely be disappointed with this movie.I felt the only member of the cast who stayed true to his character was John Goodman,he sounded and behaved just like Fred Flintstone from the classic animated series.I didn't appreciate Rick Moranis,who sounded nothing like the original Barney Rubble,and I especially disliked Rosie O'Donnel,Betty Rubble is one of the most attractive cartoon characters ever,and then they get one of the ugliest characters in Hollywood to play her,that was a bad casting decision.I also didn't like Halle Berry,she was just thrown in to amuse the dads watching this with their kids,and her name literally being Sharon Stone was not at all funny.When Fred Flintstone (John Goodman) gives Barney (Rick Moranis) money so he can adopt a child,Barney gives Fred the opportunity of getting the job he has always wanted.",The Flintstones

21,ironhorse_iv,"Trust me, I'm not stoned. I really do kinda like this movie. This movie is a guilty pleasure of mine.",5,17 October 2016,"Yes, it's a yabba-dabba-dumb dumb movie, but it's a fun film. I kinda like this rock and a hard place movie. It's not as bad, as some people may think. It's somewhat underrated. Directed by Brian Levant, this live action adaptation of the 1960s animated television series of the same name tells the story of Fred Flintstone, a stone-age family man living in the town of Bedrock. Each week, Fred pursue several ill-fated schemes in order to get rich, often getting in trouble. The film follows a similar plot line in which, Fred Flintstone played by John Goodman venture into yet another scheme; this time run by the villainous, executive vice-president of Slate & Co, Cliff Vandercave (Kyle MacLachlan). Only to find out that this 'get rich' plan, might cost him, his friendship with long-time, buddy, Barney Rubble (Rick Moranis). Without spoiling the movie, too much, like the show, it's highly parodying the 1950 show, 'the Honeymooners', while also having clever juxtaposition of the modern day with a Stone Age flair. It's the main reason for this movie's charm. As adaptations go, this is probably one of the most faithful you can find of a source material. Of course, it also helped that the creators, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera were supervising the whole project as executive producers. One of the reasons, Brian Levant was selected as the director was because he was a huge fan of the animation series and it shows in how much work and love, Levant and his crew provided. Everything prop, costume and set in this film, looks and feels like it was from the animation series. It was amazing! Added to that, the visual effects for Dino, Dictabird, and the other prehistoric creatures were great! Jim Henson's Creature Shop did a hell of a job! Even most of the casting match so well to the original series. Reportedly, this version would not have been made if John Goodman had turned down the role. He was awesome. Rick Moranis also, work well as Fred's friend, Barney. I really do buy their friendship. Elizabeth Perkins was astonishing as Fred's wife, Wilma. Not only, was she beautiful, but she was able to show Wilma's signature sass. I like the conflict, she has with Halle Berry's Miss Stone. Berry was sexy, and on fire with this role. Yet, how iconic would it, be if Sharon Stone was to play the character with her namesake character. It would had been great. Anyways, however, not everybody was great in this film. Rosie O'Donnell is a great example. She really fails to live up to the role as Barney's wife, Betty, even with her mastering the character's signature giggle. The reasons for that, is that she doesn't show any other mannerisms, besides Betty looking worry and caring for her husband. Where was Betty's attitude!? Honestly, the original choice of Janine Turner would had been better! Another distracting role in the film, had to be Elizabeth Taylor as Wilma's mother, Pearl Slaghoople in her last theatrical appearance. She looks nothing like the original character. If anything, she was just rehashing a role, similar to 1962's 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'. In my opinion, I would rather see, Audrey Meadows, as she was wonderful, in her deadpan delivery as housewife Alice Kramden on the 'the Honeymooners'. Plus, it would be a clever way to ease fans into seeing this film. Yet, there were some fans that criticized this film for its adult-driven storyline, which they deemed too mature for family audiences. In my opinion, those critics are all wrong. It's so faithful to the original, which also had references to sex, plus on screen drinking and smoking. The show was popular, because of its adult-driven humor. The first two seasons of the show were kinda notorious for it. Look at those old Winston Cigarettes commercial to get what, I'm talking about. Anyways, the show turn more, family-friendly by the third season when the baby, Pebbles is introduced & the ratings start to drop. If anything, the adult storyline save this movie from being boring. As a kid of the 1990s, the embezzlement plot wasn't too complex, not to figure out. I think, our children are smarter than we take them, for. At least, the plot is better than the original plot that seem to be a weird version of 1940's 'The Grapes of Wrath'. That really sounds depressing. Yet, there were some plot-holes in the story that I didn't like, such as the inconsistencies of Barney's kid, strength and the villains wanted an idiot to run the company to the ground, by hiring the smartest person for the job with an aptitude test. It just doesn't make any sense like the saber-toothed tiger that somehow is in the show's credits, but never in the show. Anyways, I have to say, this movie deserve more credit. It's not the worst out there. If anything, the 2000's prequel, 'The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas' is far more unwatchable. Unlike its predecessor, it failed at the box office, which this film didn't. In the end, give the 1994 version, another look. It's deserve it.",The Flintstones
22,The-Sarkologist,Dino was the only thing I liked about this movie,3,9 February 2012,"This movie is an attempt to turn a classic cartoon into a live action movie. The question is did it work? I found the Flintstones to be clichéd, full of shameless advertising which did not work on me, having a very bland and boring plot, and generally I thought it was rubbish. The film was targeted at children, but those of us who grew up with the Flintstones, would have seen this movie for the memories. My comment on this is that I am glad that I waited for it to come on to television. The Flintstones worked as a cartoon, but it does not work as a live action movie.The idea behind the Flintstones is that they are a typical American family living in the stone age. The original creators did this as a parody of the American way of life. The concept was clever and the show was very popular. What the filmmakers have tried to do is to continue this theme and in the movie it does not work. I thought that their attempt to parody the American culture failed abysmally. The worse part was their attempt at doing this with McDonalds. It was supposed to be funny, but I thought that is was a shameless product placement for a place that I detest anyway. In the original cartoons, I thought that the creators taking modern inventions and placing them in the prehistoric setting was clever, here it is not.Turning away from the rubbish that is this movie, I think that there is something that is interesting that appears in the original cartoon as well as here. Remembering that the movie is an attempt to copy the cartoon, the concept is probably not as important here. Everything in the Flintstones is big. With the modern age of miniaturisation, things have become smaller, which means that we have more space for more stuff, but what we see in the Flintstones is a reflection of hyperconsumption. Everything here is much larger than life. Spare ribs are so big that they tip the car over. Families have sabretooth tigers instead of cats, and Pterrodactyls do their business on cars instead of pigeons. The direction of society today is to have more and better things, especially in regards to food. With 60% of Americans on weightloss programs, it is interesting to see how big things in the Flintstones reflect the hyperconsumer of the American way of life.The only thing that I liked about the movie was Dino. He was obviously computer animated, but I thought that they did an incredible job with him. Dino is seriously cool, the huge dog that always jumps on Fred and slobbers all over him. The interaction between Dino and Fred was quite impressive. Other than this, I did not like this movie one bit.",The Flintstones
23,slightlymad22,John Goodman Is Perfect As Fred Flintstone,4,29 December 2014,"Far from the worst movie I have ever seen, but still a missed opportunity, and not really that good.Plot In A Paragraph: Jurassic Jollies all around as we get the first live action version of ""The Flintstones"" in which there is trouble at the Quarey as Senior Executive Cliff Vandercave (Kyle MacLachlan) and secretary Miss Sharon Stone (Halle Berry) plan to swindle the company of its vast fortune and flee, but they need a stooge to take the fall for it. Enter a promotion for Fred. The film stars John Goodman as Fred Flintstone, Rick Moranis as Barney Rubble, Elizabeth Perkins as Wilma Flintstone, and Rosie O'Donnell as Betty Rubble, along with Kyle MacLachlan as an executive-vice president of Fred's company, Halle Berry as his seductive secretary and Elizabeth Taylor, in her final theatrical film, as Wilma's mother.Visually it's impressive, and a lot of the fun things to see are usually little things, often in the background. Goodman is the perfect Fred, whilst Moranis is great as Barney, elsewhere Halle Berry literally steams up the screen she is that hot. Sadly Kyle MacLachlan is in full pantomime villain mode and it's just as well this was Liz Taylor's last movie as she over acts horribly.",The Flintstones
24,John6Daniels,It's not that bad,6,6 August 2021,"It's not the best effort. Flintstones is a live action movie based on the legendary cartoon. The casting is questionable with Halle Berry and Rosie. Overall, Fred cast was perfect. During the 90s Goodman was relevant like many others who are now missing out of action for whatever reason.The designs, costumes and effect were before its time and looks way better than cgi. With CGI they often look amazing when you first watch on your second run or watching a movie years later you notice the cgi looks like hash.Overall, a decent family movie. It's not the worse of the worse for example that Dora the Explorer movie. Now that one was a complete hash.",The Flintstones
25,filipemanuelneto,"A family film, more focused on the emotions and moral lessons than proper to the comedy.",4,22 July 2017,"I always liked the cartoon ""Flintstones"", which I went on TV when I was a kid, but this movie proved to be much weaker than I thought it could be. The plot starts well, puts Fred in a morally reprehensible position, getting an enviable promotion at the expense of his faithful friend, Barney, and confronting him with regrets and consequences. But this ends up making the film too serious and thoughtful, erasing the very fragile attempts to make comedy that are tempted through it. I confess I was expecting a stronger bet on comedy and this disappointed me but, after that, I was able to appreciate this work better and enjoy it for what it is: a family film, with a moral lesson behind and emotional moments, but able to please both children and adults.The work done to recreate scenarios and props of the cartoon is quite satisfactory and shows us most of environments we have become accustomed to associate with it. John Goodman is a good Fred Flintstone. The physical similarities have helped but the psychological construction of the character also deserves congratulations. Elizabeth Perkins gave life to Wilma in a very interesting way. Rick Moranis was OK as Barney, but made the character too naive to be worthy of credibility. Rosie O'Donnell was OK too. Halle Berry was decent in one more character where the actress does not have much to do (well, since I never considered her particularly talented, maybe it's better). It was nice to see the diva Elizabeth Taylor, although in a small cameo Wilma's mother.",The Flintstones
26,FiendishDramaturgy,Mildly Adorable,5,21 April 2007,"This isn't as bad as some people have said. At the same time, it isn't Oscar-worthy material, either. The play on words, everyday objects, products, and proper names (Univershell) is quite cute, and the performances are about what you would expect.This film is cutely quaint, though full of cheese, just like the animated series. I particularly enjoyed the many modes of transportation and machinery, along with Elizabeth Taylor, Rosie O'Donnell and John Goodman.The animated series always mildly reminded me of the Honeymooners, and this reminiscence is exacerbated by the live action version, in Goodman's on again, off again New York accent, and Barney's total loyalty to Fred.The story itself is typical of a Flintstone's animation with little surprise and nothing new, but seeing it in live action form makes it worth viewing if you are a fan of the series.

I can't say there isn't something appealing in watching bedrock realized in live action and John Goodman as Fred seems to have been divinely contrived.It's remarkable the amount of technical talent, in the acting, the sets, the animatronics etc. that gets washed up in projects like this, desperate to cash in on nostalgia. A lot of this is charming in its own way but an awful lot is equally skippable. It's the main plot that is really the worst thing, you've seen it in a thousand episodes of kids sitcoms: someone is lifted to a new social status and acts like a to their friends. A lot of this makes little sense and the gags are hit and miss.But it looks impressive though and the enthusiasm behind it pretty cool. A lot of the cartoonishness of the original has been translated to the live action and it often doesn't really work. Fred's twinkle toes bowling style feels a bit awkard but him raising off the ground exclaim you-know-what really made me feel fuzzy.Costumes look weirdly cheap though but the music (including a guest appearance by th B52s) are great.",The Flintstones

I had action figures & fridge magnets & cups & all sorts from the movie!!! The Flintstones was huge in 1994!!!
Legendary Steven Spielberg was producer so you knew the effort & budget that went into this project was huge along with the nice Spielberg feel of family & sense of wonder.John Goodman was PERFECT as Fred Flintstone,he gave a fully fun & often touching performance & is a joy to watch.

29,dwpollar,Well-made live action imitation...,7,12 January 2003,"1st watched 1/12/2003 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Brian Levant): Well-made live action imitation of the popular Hanna-Barbera cartoon series. Maybe it's because Hanna & Barbera were involved and were two of the executive producers of the movie as well as having small roles in the production.  Besides this, this classic tale of life in the stone age had tremendous casting in the way of John Goodman(Fred Flintstone), Rick Moranis(Barney Rubbel) and the entire group for that matter.  The movie starts with the Rubbel family adding a new member in the adopted Bam-Bam and then the rest of the movie matches pretty much the way the two families lived their lives & worked together as neighbors in the prehistoric town of Bedrock.  Of course there is evil-a-foot within a demented man in a higher position in the stone quarry who tries to frame Fred and the rest of the movie is a culmination of all this.  What is great about the movie & the series the Flintstones is that no matter what trouble they got in, the families always patched it up in the end showing us what true friends our made of.   And besides all this the movie was funny & visually appealing too !!",The Flintstones
30,davispittman,Family friendly fun comedy,7,3 August 2017,"This live action version of the classic animated TV show is fun and family friendly overall. It's kind of like Scooby Doo (2002) in the way that it's not G rated, it's got some adult references, especially involving Berry's character. But the references really aren't explicit and I still think that all families will really enjoy this film. The casting for all the roles is just perfect. John Goodman is a great choice for Fred. Rosie O'Donnell is great as Betty. I loved Elizabeth Perkins in the role of Wilma. And Rick Moranis is a very good Barney. And of course we can't leave out the great late Elizabeth Taylor who plays Wilma's mother. The script is very much like other live action versions of TV shows, it involves a greedy villain who's after nothing but money. I really like Halle Berry in her seductive secretary/bad guy role. The visuals are done well, the shots are all very true to the original show. Adults may enjoy this and I still enjoy watching it, but a family setting is probably the best audience for this movie. It's just good fun, nothing that great or Oscar winning, but it'll make a fairly fun movie night. 7/10.",The Flintstones
31,gcd70,The novelty wear off quickly,4,23 January 2008,"It would seem that no popular cartoon or comic book hero is safe now. Nothing is sacred! Brian Levant's ""The Flinstones"" follows a plethora of animated features cum screen sensations from ""Batman"" to the other recent Hanna and Barbera production, ""The Jetsons"".Though that well loved space age family did maintain its animated status, ""the modern stone age family"" was not as fortunate. John Goodman, reputedly at the insistence of Steven Spielberg, got the choice role of Fred, the great big lovable oaf who has a heart that's every bit as soft as his head. Elizabeth Perkins plays stern wife Wilma, Rick Moranis is old pal Barney Rubble, and comedienne Rosie O'Donnell (""A League of Their Own"") is Barney's wife Betty.While everybody looks the part, and no expense has been spared in re-creating Bedrock, none of the characters are ever interesting enough to hold your attention for more than ten minutes. The cartoon-esqe plot, with villains Cliff Van der Cave (Kyle MacLachlan) and sidekick secretary Stone (Halle Berry) framing Fred for embezzling, is painfully stretched out for ninety or so minutes with the assistance of a subplot involving the Rubbles' adoption of a darling little Neanderthal named ""Bamm-Bamm"". In fact the only interesting and genuinely entertaining character is Fred's talkative piece of office equipment, the ""Dictabird"" (voiced by Harvey Korman).All this is not to say that Brian Levant has let us down, as he has been very true to the original 60's cartoon series, and both Jim Henson's creature creations and William Sandell's production design are a credit to their collective geniuses. However there is very little one can do with a show that was never really meant to leave the T.V. set.I guess the novelty wears off all too quickly, unless you're a ""Flinstones"" freak or a minor.

Fred gets tricked and ends up being in debt and becoming an outlaw. It sounds stupid, and it is, but it's really a fun movie. The sets are amazing, and the best part is, instead of computer animation taking over, most of these awesome sets were actually built. Even the dinosaurs, excluding Dino at times, are animatronics. The acting is OK, not great, mainly because of which actors portray which characters. Barney on the cartoon was supposed to be a husky little guy, and Rick Moranis was in no way fat. Betty was supposed to be petite, and Rosie O'Donnell was terrible casting, and she gives an odd, bad performance.

35,MartianOctocretr5,A mockery of the original cartoon,2,13 June 2006,"Movie remakes of TV shows have been notoriously failing miserably for some time (but they keep getting made anyway, for whatever reason), so it was inevitable that somebody would start churning out these remakes based on classic cartoons. An early victim was ""The Flintstones,"" a failed experiment that should have told them not to do any more of these.Quite simply, this movie stinks like a pile of dinosaur droppings.The original cartoon poked innocent fun at mainstream America, creatively clothing it with prehistoric costumes and primitive ""technology,"" focusing on an everyday family and putting them in wild situations. Fred, Wilma, Barney, and Betty were all likable, and we laughed at Fred's ridiculous schemes and the chaotic outcomes.The spirit of the cartoon is non-existent here. The characters just argue, screw up, argue some more, screw up some more. People lie, cheat, and back stab. Everyone is boorish and mean; and just make you angry. The script goes nowhere, in story or comedy. Jokes don't work--come to think of it, were there any jokes even in this thing? Or any comedy at all? Wait: One (and only one) thing was funny--Rosie O'Donnell had the Betty Rubble snicker down. That's it.John Goodman, Rick Moranis, and Elizabeth Perkins (all normally good comic actors) seem lost in this primeval slop.

I also first saw this live action movie based on the cartoon when I was nine years old, the year after it came out, and again a few years later, when I was in my very early teens. I'm not sure exactly what I thought the first time, but I clearly remember that I liked it a lot the second time. However, as you grow up, your tastes tend to change, and seeing the low rating for this movie, it doesn't surprise me that I no longer care much for it.Fred Flintstone gives his friend, Barney Rubble money so he and his wife, Betty can afford to adopt a child. Barney is very grateful, and feels he must somehow repay Fred. Soon after this, an exam is held at Slate and Company to determine who is worthy of being the new vice president, and whoever gets the job will become rich. Barney does well on the exam, but Fred does very poorly. When Barney discovers this, he sees it as a good opportunity to try and repay his friend, so he decides to switch the tests. As a result, Fred gets the highest score and becomes the new vice president! However, the proud Flintstone is totally unaware of the fact that he is being used! Cliff Vandercave and Rosetta Stone plan to use money from Slate & Co. to go to Rockapulco, and the whole purpose of the exam was actually to find a scapegoat! Now that Fred is vice president, he will be that scapegoat! Worse still, now that Fred and Wilma are rich, they are not quite the same, and this could mean the end of their relationship with the Rubbles! If you're at all familiar with the cartoon show, you would obviously assume that this movie is a comedy, and it is. However, as such, it fails miserably in my book! I never laughed, and barely even smiled. The only scene that gave me a full smile was the one where Wilma and Betty try to wake up the Dictabird, and he says, ""No, Mumsie, I don't want to go to school. The other boys make fun of me."" I also found Green Jelly's ""Anarchy in Bedrock"" (a parody of The Sex Pistols' ""Anarchy in the U.K."") during the end credits fairly amusing, but I don't know if that counts. Now, this live action adaptation does have an interesting premise, some impressive sets, and a good serious moment here and there. I also think Rick Moranis makes a very good Barney, and certain other cast members fit their roles well. Unfortunately, this is not enough to prevent most of the movie from being dull, with mostly mediocre jokes, as well as some cheesy moments, most notably the scenes where Rosetta Stone flirts with Fred.Without a doubt, some ""Flintstones"" fans HATE this movie, or just don't like it. It's common for remakes and movie adaptations of TV shows to disappoint many fans, and this 1994 ""Flintstones"" movie is no exception. If you ask me, this is one of those movies that was aimed at kids, and doesn't have a lot for those outside that targeted audience. So, I guess I recommend it for kids who want an amusing adventure, but for adults, whether you're a ""Flintstones"" fan or not, I wouldn't get my hopes up. After watching this first live action adaptation of the cartoon again, it certainly hasn't made me feel desperate to watch the apparently inferior ""The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas"", a prequel to this movie released in 2000, which features a totally different main cast.",The Flintstones
38,Hollywood_Yoda,Sometimes a Meteor is Needed,5,23 October 2018,"The Flintstones was one of the first animated TV shows from the 1960s to get the live action treatment. Was it weird? Yes, a little bit. The cast that was chosen was not the best, the exception being John Goodman as Fred and Rick Moranis as Barney. Rosie O'Donnell as Betty was a terrible choice, both in her career and for this film.Some of the stunts and jokes were funny, but the film would have been better animated. It's usually a mistake to make a live action film from an animated show, this was no exception. It's a family film, but it won't hold kids attention. If you want to see The Flintstones, watch the animated show or one of the animated films.By all means, never watch the sequel, Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas, it's a travesty!",The Flintstones
39,tbills2,Meet The Flintstones. Meet Halle Berry!,6,8 July 2013,"The Flintstones is a live-action alteration of the '60s cartoon that does not remain too proper to the original animated series. The movie doesn't do a very well job in incorporating Bedrock and its world into the story or the viewing of the movie as it attempts to expand on the original cartoon without having all too much creativity, BUUUUT, it's still very good, and it's still a very lovely family adventure. I love the Flintstones movie. The Flintstones is amusingly funny all the way through with a likable story and a friendly disposition. The Flintstones has pleasant visuals; it has greatly glamorous sets as it is wondrously colorful. The interactive Bedrock environments are really solid. The cast is full of chiseled actors, well....okay, it's a really good cast. John Goodman plays a great Fred Flintstone. Goodman and Elizabeth Perkins are both fine as Fred and Wilma Flintstone. Rick Moranis is really good in a poorly written Barney Rubble character, and Rosie O'Donnell is pissy and not good as she struggles in what's supposed to be a sweet Betty Rubble character. This is a likable Kyle MacLachlan role as he's good in a consistently well-written villain character, but I have yet to ever take notice of MacLachlan while I am watching the Flintstones. Holy smokes! Hello, Halle Berry! My goodness! You're scorchingly beautiful! Wow! Miss Halle Berry as Miss Stone is smoking hot! My God! Look at her! Halle Berry as Miss Stone is so rocking hot beyond belief! Bamm-Bamm! The hottest girl in history! Halle Berry as Miss Stone is melting me with her fire! Oh my! Sweet Halle! Halle as Miss Stone gives one of the sexiest flirtatious jobs I've ever seen! Yabba dabba do! Halle Berry is unbelievable as she gives an all-time lovely performance. The Flintstones serves as a launching pad to Halle's destined superstardom. Berry blatantly owns this movie from beginning to end, and Halle is so clearly the great standout star of The Flintstones, not so much in an 'everybody else is bad she's so great' kind of a way but more so in an 'everybody's so good oh she's so very good' kind of way. Berry's amazing. It's more than just my imagination, Berry's scenes are just better; maybe it's her performance, maybe it's her bodacious body in that dress. Her scenes were meant to serve as a sweet getaway so that the audience could get lost in Halle's gorgeous eyes, and her freakishly fine physique for some time, but they actually serve as critical plot points. Halle has all the best parts. Miss Stone is a respectable and an elegant written character. Stone is the heroine of The Flintstones, and Halle's the heroine of my heart. I love Halle so. The lovely Elizabeth Taylor appears in her farewell performance and she's...so lovely. She's too great a choice to play Fred's mother-in-law; I'm grateful Taylor decided to do the role. Elizabeth brings real life to the character. The Flintstones is a gay old time. It's very good family fun that earns a good 6 graciously attributed to the perfect performance from the irresistibly sexy Halle Berry.",The Flintstones
40,bellino-angelo2014,Why all the hate towards this movie?? It's actually one of the best adaptations from a classic cartoon,8,19 February 2021,"I must have seen this movie at least 3 times during my childhood since it was aired often on channel 6. A few years later I remembered about it and I was shocked when I looked its appaling score of 4,6 when I checked the first time (January 2018). Few months later I re-watched it and I had always the same opinion about it, and I think it's very underrated here.The film's plot is sort of an extention of the cartoon's plot. Here Fred Flintstone (John Goodman) has the possibility of becoming the new vice presidenty of Slate & Co (in the quarry where he works) and he takes the test. However his best friend Barney Rubble (Rick Moranis) switches tests with him and Fred his promoted. However his former vice president Cliff Vandercave (Kyle MacLachlan) has an evil plan for him: making him signing forms that will involve him in the company's embezzlement. When Fred and Barney are chased by a lynch mob they are freed thanks to the Dictabird but in the meanwhile Cliff abducted their kids for ransom. After defeating Cliff, Mr. Slate comes by and tells Fred to elect him as president of his division. After the bad experience Fred refuses as he has learned his lesson.The cast is nearly perfect. John Goodman was perfect for the role of Fred Flintstone and I think he was born for it, and Rick Moranis was also perfect as Barney Rubble. Elizabeth Perkins as Wilma and Rosie O'Donnell as Betty are very good despite O'Donnell looked a bit too fat for the role. Kyle MacLachlan is surprisingly good as the evil vice president of the Slate & Co. and Halle Berry is incredibly sexy as his secretary. It was quite surprising seeing 1950s' legendary actress Elizabeth Taylor as Wilma's mother in what turned out to be her final movie performance.While the movie isn't exactly excellent, it is perfect in what is supposed to be... a live action adaptation of a cartoon. Nothing more, nothing less. Pleasant and adequate... and not deserving at all of the bad score and reviews. Just one of those great family movies that can be enjoyed safely by both kids and adults.",The Flintstones

Shoddy and over complicated storyline for the series, the filmmakers seem more interested in being overly serious.

When the movie came out I was baffled as to why it was made, I assumed it was because evil rules the world. Much later when I found the movie for sale on VHS for one dollar, I bought it under the hopes that maybe an ironic viewing might somehow redeem this movie. Irony could not save the Flintstones.

44,bigverybadtom,They Just Couldn't Pull It Off,3,24 November 2012,"Years ago, there was a fad in Hollywood for making live-action adaptations of old cartoons. Most if not all of these live-action adaptations didn't work. This movie is one such instance.Yes, it tried to stick to the spirit of the old series, plus adding a few new jokes, such as a volcanic eruption closing a highway forever (and that type of event being considered routine). But the main joke of the cartoon was the idea of using animals in clever ways, such as a bird for a factory whistle or dinosaurs for construction machines. This idea worked as an animated cartoon. Unfortunately it just wasn't the same, or as effective, using animatronic animals. The other effects, such as Slate's stone spectacles, also didn't really work in live action either.The actors did okay, though Rosie O'Donnell was the worst choice possible for Betty Rubble. The story is a standard Flintstones-type plot: evil manipulators try to loot Fred's employer, and as part of the plot, Fred is promoted to a high office in the company, and Fred is too stupid to realize he is being used.Recommended for Flintstones completists only.",The Flintstones

I enjoyed it for what it was as a child - it was okay! I remember the animated show appearing on Boomerang, and use to watch plenty of episodes especially before heading off to school. It's just a stand-alone movie to the animated series, and there's not much difference between the two - really! It was good that it was made since The Flintstones was still a popular show back then otherwise it never would've been made. The movie shouldn't be taken too seriously, and should be enjoyed for what it was. Yes, it does have flaws, and the story can seem a bit vague, but that shouldn't stop you from enjoying it. If you're a fan of The Flintstones, watch it otherwise don't. Just be glad that there is actually a movie about this show.

The live-action film adaptation of the animated television series The Flintstones produced from 1960 to 1966 by Hanna-Barbera, the film stars John Goodman as Fred Flintstone, Rick Moranis as Barney Rubble, Elizabeth Perkins as Wilma Flintstone, and Rosie O ' Donnell as Betty Rubble, along with Kyle MacLachlan as executive vice president of Fred's company, Halle Berry as his seductive secretary and Elizabeth Taylor in his latest film, as Wilma's mother. The B-52s performed a different version of the theme song. The film, which was shot in California, was released in theaters on May 27, 1994 and grossed nearly $ 342 million worldwide from a budget of $ 46 million, making it a box office success, despite criticism. negative comments from critics. Observers criticized the plot and tone, which they considered too mature and mature for the family audience, as well as O'Donnell's casting as Betty and Taylor as Pearl, but praised their visual effects, costumes, art direction and the performance of Goodman like Fred. Executive Cliff Vandercave and his beautiful secretary Aghata Cristal promote an aptitude test at Pedregulho & Cia., Where Fred Flintstone comes out on top. He exchanges his job as Bronto-Digger operator for a vice president position. But it's not as good as it sounds: Both are planning to use Fred as a scapegoat in a big scam scheme! The Flintstones marvel at the lives of the richer, while the Rubbles experience financial hardship. In this, the two families split the friendship. Only the corruption scheme is discovered and all the blame lies with Fred and Wilma. It is now up to Barney and Betty to race against time to save their friends. It had been a long time since I watched this nostalgic movie, I reviewed it again and didn't even remember the movie 🤣!

I was a huge fan of the cartoon back in my childhood and it was great to see the live-action version of the cartoon!  The story is pretty good, although it is obviously directed toward it's child audience, but I still loved it.I can't talk about this movie without talking about the special effects! They were incredible!!!  Dino looked absolutely spectacular!  As did the other dinosaurs and beasts in the film.  I really liked the sets and the wardrobe as well.  You can tell that a lot of work went into this film and a great deal of thought.The cast was nearly perfect!  John Goodman was just fantastic as Fred Flintstone and was perfect for the part!  Rick Moranis wouldn't have been my first choice for Barney Rubble, but he did a superb job!  I've always liked Rick Moranis, this guy needs to do more films!  Elizabeth Perkins was excellent as Wilma Flintstone, and is quite the looker in the film.  The only complaint I have is Rosie O'Donnell, I'm sorry, but something about her just rubs me the wrong way.  I've never really liked her acting very much, and I don't think she really fit the role of Betty Rubble.  I would have preferred to see someone else in the role.  Kyle MacLachlan was a very good villain and Halle Berry was PERFECT!  Elizabeth Taylor was a nice touch as well, I wouldn't have expected to see her in the film, but she did a very good job.If you like the cartoon, then you should definitely give this a shot.  The comedy was very similar to the television show, so I don't think you'll be disappointed.  Anyhow, I really enjoyed the film and I hope that you will too.

49,rlcsljo,"The TV series brought to ""life""",6,8 April 2001,"Unlike many other ""live action"" cartoons, the ""Flintstones, The (1994)"" did not try to ""update"" or ""modernize"" the original from the TV series.  (Except for the use of obviously modern actors and rock bands).  This movie was the ""Flintstones"" circa 1966(B.C) down to the detailing of the dinosaurs.
The characterizations were pretty much on, except Barney (he worked in a rock quarry and probably should have been stockier), and Betty (she was a babe in the TV series, but for some reason was played by a more rotund Rosie O'Donnell--though she was slimmer then than she is now).The plot was a bit weak, but it was still great fun for fans of the TV series.Look for some inside jokes, like Fred being called ""Flagstone""-- supposedly the original title of the series.I believe, overall, the sequel to this was better.",The Flintstones

51,ExpendableMan,"""For your information, the lodge no longer accepts Neanderthals""",3,28 April 2021,"There's a scene early on in The Flintstones where we get a brief glimpse of the film it should have been. Betty and Barney Rubble go to adopt their new son Bam-Bam, a long-haired, feral child raised by ""wild mastodons."" He then proceeds to run riot. There's a short montage with him bashing holes in walls and generally causing chaos, before falling asleep on Betty's lap as she reads him a bedtime story. Betty fights back tears and it's a rare moment of warmth.It only lasts about two minutes but it's by far the best bit of the movie. The rest of The Flintstones is not good. In fact it's really, really bad. The set design and costume work is undeniably impressive and yes it looks great, but bad casting and a poor story undo everything.A Flintstones movie should be a light-hearted, easy-going romp, so why is this film so serious? The storyline is a complicated, cynical affair which involves Fred being framed for money laundering while Barney struggles with unemployment and an increasing resentment for his best friend. It's a strangely dark film, with nods to extra-marital affairs, office politics and attempted child murder sitting at odds with the colourful setting.Then there's the cast. John Goodman and Rick Moranis are both fine actors, but they do not resemble Fred and Barney and there's a notable lack of chemistry between them. Rosie O'Donnell makes an unconvincing Betty and only Elizabeth Perkins' Wilma seems to have been modelled after the cartoon original.Throw in a lack of jokes and The Flintstones is sadly a missed opportunity. It looks like a film made by a committee for the express purpose of selling Happy Meals. Bedrock looks amazing and the set, prop and costume designers deserve all the credit, but this is too humourless to be enjoyable.",The Flintstones

Having not watched the Flintstones in years, I was having to re-remember everything as I watched this movie.

The gags are delivered with deadpan seriousness, which makes them work very well. It is well cast, especially the leads of John Goodman, Rick Moranis, Kyle MacLachlan and Halle Berry. Even the kids come across as convincing versions of the animated characters, which is totally amazing!Of course the most outstanding element of this movie is the magnificent production design, art direction, and other elements that make the recreation of a ""20th century-style Stone Age"" very involving to hang the story on.But as I said before, what I really like about this movie is the excellent deadpan comic style, which up to that time hadn't been effectively presented for a long time (certainly not in Hollywood productions anyway). The general feeling at the time was that 80s-90s big budget Hollywood couldn't handle satirical or farcical comedy very well. The wit got lost in the mix. And Steven Spielburg proved them wrong.

I, too, have watched the cartoon when I was a kid, and I do think this is a fairly good adaption.The movie is funny, original, and entertaining. It's a light-hearted comedy, which isn't meant to be serious or ""realistic"".

He was OK, but just didn't seem to fit the part. I'm not even going to get in to how awfully cast Rosie O'Donnell was. The other characters, such as Wilma's mother or the villain, Cliff, were all well cast and did great. Oh, and Harvey Korman as the Dictabird was easily one of the highlights.The style of Bedrock translates perfectly to the screen, and looks amazing. Just like the cartoon come to life, they did a great job.The only real downfall of this film is the plot. Sure, the cartoon always had kind of cheesy plots, but this takes the mud-pie. Essentially it's just a formulaic spin on Greek tragedy, complete with catharsis and all that fun stuff. Fred as a tragic hero? Bad idea.When it comes down to it though, this is A lot of fun.

They are the only ones to not know that they are being set up. Duh-uh!Costumes and scenery are tacky. The plot is weak (white-collar crime isn't good for a plot). Characters are stereotypes. Technically this live-action film qualifies as science fiction due to anachronisms, but it's the fiction of pseudo-science.The dinosaurs-and-humans stuff is utter nonsense. Large mammals (anything larger than Yorkshire Terriers) could never have survived around T. Rex. If your children like dinosaurs, then stick to Barney (the dinosaur, not Barney Rubble) or the animated Land Before Time series.

It cold have been funnier, there was plenty of room for improvement, but they were faithful top the look and feel and spirit of the cartoon, and like I said, it just HAD to be done.I seriously doubt the directors and producers could have forgiven themselves if they passed on this opportunity - I certainly wouldn't have forgiven them.And Mr. Slate naming a new discovery after his daughter, Concretia, remains one of my favorite gags of all time.",The Flintstones

First of all, I don't know how Halle Berry went from this movie to an Oscar winning actress.  As far as the story goes, there are not really any complaints. Its expected to be simple, and I can respect that.  The problem with this movie, which is essentially eye candy(well it was back then), is the acting. John Goodman, who has made some fine turns in films like ""Fallen"" and ""The Big Lebowski"", is just bad.  It seems to me that he is doing his best Jackie Gleason impression, and its really not all that good.  Rosie O'Donnell gives a stiff, and yet somehow melodramatic performance.  Don't ask me how thats possible.  Rick Moranis is just annoying as Barnie.  Elizabeth Perkins is extremely one dimensional and fails to capture the fire of a cartoon character.  In all fairness, this is also the fault of bad direction.  All in all, I'm glad I'm older now because I can see the errors of my ways, and the errors of others ways as well.

Barney and his Wife Betty (Rosie O'Donnell) are desperate for a baby, so Fred lends them everything he and Wilma(Elizabeth Perkins) have in their savings account so that they can adopt Cave Boy Bamm-Bamm (Hilynur & Marino Sigurdsson)To return the favour, Barney during an Exam swaps his paper with Fred who has done particularly badly, and by doing so Fred ends up being promoted to Vice President, but only because Exec V.P. Cliff Vandercave (Kyle Maclachlan) & his accomplice Miss Stone (Halle Berry) need a Fall guy for their embezzlement scheme. REVIEW:- It took a while but after 30 Years (at the time) since the original 60s classic Cartoon series was shown, Finally in 1994 a live-Action Film came to be produced by Steven Spielberg...Is it any good?..... Well I first saw this on it's original release in 1994 on my 10th Birthday, and at the time I thought it was the best Film I'd ever seen....15 Years or so later, I no Longer think that, But I still Find 'The Flintstones (1994)' hugely enjoyable from Start to finish, The set design is magnificent and it's incredibly charming with great performances by John Goodman and Elizabeth Perkins (as Fred & Wilma)The Bad news is the story feels like it was written on the back of a Cigarette packet in 5 Minutes, Rick Moranis is TOO weedy to Play Barney, Rosie O'Donnell was badly miscast and way TOO fat to play Betty (Who was slimmer than Wilma in the series) and Elizabeth Taylor again miscast as Fred's Mother-in-law and is pretty much wasted in one of her last roles.On the whole the spectacle outweighs the Mistakes...Just sit back and EnjoyThe Critics Hated this...But The Paying Public loved it - It opened to $29.6M on Memorial Day Weekend in 1994 and went on to gross over $130M in North America and over $340M Worldwide on a $45M BudgetFollowed by a Prequel in 2000 'Viva Rock Vegas' Without This Cast and Bombed accordingly***1/2 out of *****",The Flintstones

70,mwcanadian,Didn't enjoy this for different reasons,2,2 December 2019,"This wasn't the best way to represent The Flinstones at all. The story wasn't really bad except that Barney was made to be smart and for Flinstone fans that doesn't make sense and Bam Bam couldn't break ropes which again doesn't make sense.In the cartoon Barney is a goof like Fred, in the movie he's the smartest one in the workplace. In the movie Bam Bam can break through a wall, but not ropes. A better story is he's knocked out somehow and can't help untie the ropes. The actors who played Fred and Wilma were fine, but Rick seems too smart for Barney and Rosie doesn't look anything like Betty.",The Flintstones
71,on_the_can,"I liked it, what can I say?",6,16 June 2008,"I was 8 years old when this movie came out and remember really liking it despite the lackluster reviews it received from not only critics but most of my friends as well. I don't remember anybody out and out hating it, it just kinda got one of those ""meh"" grunts whenever it was mentioned.Now I'm twenty three and I just watched it again and I gotta say, I still think it's pretty damn good. And unless you just simply are not of a fan of the Flintstones cartoons I don't see how you can not like this film. It plays like an extended episode of the series, with a plot not unlike something we have seen in our Saturday morning reruns, but loaded with enough clever one liners and risqué humor to elevate it to a much more adult oriented comedy. It's also got tons of sight gags and background jokes that you will likely need some multiple viewings to appreciate. Not to mention the sheer scope and execution of the sets, costumes and animatronic and CG dinosaurs are really something to admire, especially for its day.The actors all play their parts well too, John Goodman and Rick Moranis as Fred and Barney are the standouts but there's nobody here that I thought fell short. Yes, I would have liked to have seen Betty portrayed with somebody with more curves in the right places...I mean she was the hottie in the cartoon and Rosie O'Donnell's physique definitely doesn't live up, but you have to give credit where credit is due and while she may not look quite the same, she plays the part well and has the voice and trademark giggle down perfectly.Is this a fantastic film no...but I enjoy it every time I watch it and I think the attention to detail and obvious care that went into making this movie alone should keep it entertaining for years to come and considering its unlikely anything quite like this will ever be done again outside of its sequels, I would not be surprised if this movie eventually earns its respect among film buffs in the future.",The Flintstones
72,messi8605-934-965055,Underrated,10,30 January 2021,The definition of underrated should have a movie poster of The Flintstones next to it. Great family friendly movie with an awesome cast.,The Flintstones
73,lrldoit,A miss except for the visuals,3,18 March 2002,"The visuals were perfect and fascinating. The story, with some rewriting could have been acceptable. What killed the movie for me was the total lack of understanding of the series as well as the lack of characterization. I know that John Goodman is no Alan Reed, but he could have watched episodes of the show and gotten the feel of it. Barney Rubble doesn't work in the quarry with Fred. No one knows what Barney does for a living. The sharp wit of Barney's dialogue was absent, to say nothing of Mel Blanc's characterization. Elizabeth Taylor was too thin to play Mrs. Pebble. (Wilma's maiden name was Pebble. The later episodes of the series forgot this.) Of course, no one could match the great Verna Felton as Fred's mother-in-law, but the writers and Miss Taylor should have tried. The pity is that with sufficient preparation and understanding of the series, this could have been wonderful. The only good touch was Rosie O' Donnell's imitation of Betty's laugh as originated by Bea Benaderet.",The Flintstones
74,jadflack,a little rocky,5,13 January 2008,"Live action film of the classic 1960's Hanna Barbara cartoon series which ran for many years until it was beaten in longevity by ""The Simpsons"" a series that does bear some similarities with the Flintstones.The film starts well and is pleasant enough but loses momentum at the half way point, despite game efforts from a cast that seems to be enjoying itself.In my opinion John Goodman and Rosie O'Donnell being the nearest to being like their cartoon characters Fred Flintstone and Betty Rubble.Elizabeth Perkins and Rick Moranis are less successful but Perkins and especially Halle Berry are decorative.A reasonably fair effort but lacks that certain something to make it come off completely.",The Flintstones
75,elainehowie,A great family film,8,14 June 2018,"Personally I enjoyed this film but I understand it's not to everyone's taste. The flintstones has a nice and simple plot that is easy to follow along, even if you have never watched the show. Yes it was a silly film but I think it's nice to just relax and enjoy it. The film does manage to create an interesting portrayal of what life would be like if the Stone Age was a little bit different.",The Flintstones
76,michaeldavies335,Take it for what it is,8,20 November 2019,"Recently saw this again (multiple times) as my young daughters (3 & 7) found it on Netflix so it was on repeat!I had seen it many years ago when it came out in the cinema and when it came on TV. Might have owned it on VHS as I'm only 35.It's a classic mid 90's movie - lots of effort put into props and the style of the movie (better than getting drowned in CGI like these days), great score and cast.Take it for what it is - an enjoyable family film for you to watch with the kids.",The Flintstones
77,stenholmgabriel,A well made family film,8,9 January 2016,"This is a well made product. The sets , costumes and props are good. The plot is nothing special but it's not bad. It's is not surprising that Steven Spielberg was involved the making of this film since the man is known for quality.The Actingis good the four stand outs being John Goodman as Fred who fits perfectly ,Elizabeth Perkins as Wilma who IS the character from the carton , Harvey Korman as the bird who has some really fun lines and Elizabeth Taylor of all people as Wilma's mother She is one of the highlights of movie. she is hilarious in every scene. This was sadly her last theatrically released film. on a side note the role of Fred's mother in law was originated by legendary voice actress Verna Felton she played the Fairy Godmother in Cinderella and had many roles in other Disney films until her death in 1966 her last film was The Jungle Book. The other actors are good but nothing remarkable.This is a good family film that everyone should show their children.",The Flintstones
78,JokerSwan,"Sure, it LOOKS like the Flintstones..but that's all",3,27 July 2001,"The Flintstones with real actors - hey, that sounds cool. Great special effects, good casting(John is SO much like Fred), and Steven Spielberg - how could it go wrong? Well, somehow, it did. Probably because of the script, this movie that starts off nicely, soon turns into a bore for grown ups and hardly a blast for the kids. The story is dull, and all the cliches are there - nagging mother-in-law, sexy secretary, rich ppl becoming arrogant, you name it! The question is, why did they bring these ""grown up"" elements into the movie? This is marketed as a kiddies' film, and I doubt they understand the story very much; for grown ups, it's simply boring to see the old cliches used once again, just in a funny setting. There are few truly funny moments, and though the actors do their best, they can't save the movie from being dull, silly, and in parts very sappy. It's a disgrace, as the original cartoon was funny, cool, and the family scenes were simply endearing.One of the things I liked was Rosie O'Donnell doing Betty's role. In the original cartoon, Betty is as slender as Wilma. It was nice to see a big girl cast in a positive role, her weight never being an issue. And Rosie does it so great - listen to her laugh. Go Rosie!All in all, I give this movie a 3 out of 10. That's for the special effects and casting. Too bad they didn't bother to write an actual storyline.",The Flintstones
79,sportskid1164,good fun comedy,10,30 June 2003,"The Flinstones, starring john goodman, rosie, elizabeth p., and rick m., was very cute and fun. It teaches you to forgive and that fame isn't as important as your family and friends. From all the reviews it got and the 4.3/10 it got here, I didn't expect much. But I did end up enjoying it. Pretty funny, too. Good Family comedy. I recommend this to people who like the show ""The Flinstones"", or comedies. If you don't like either of those, then you might not enjoy it as much.Good Fun comedy! ****(out of five) stars",The Flintstones
80,cblazo,No one but John Goodman could....,5,23 July 2013,"I really enjoy John Goodman and have seen most of what he has done. Therefor, I wanted to see this film due to him being in it and because the Flintstones take me back. I think the film was o.k. The set design was great and nobody else could play Fred. Rick Moranis and Elizabeth Perkins were great for their parts too. Rosie O'Donnell shouldn't be in any movie. Ugh. The plot was transparent, but good acting and nostalgia kept me interested. I liked the animatronics in the film. They were very good for the time and Steven Spielberg is a master. The details in the backgrounds were very good. The Flintstones is a movie done well, but it is still a movie about the Flintstones and that's why it wont ever have a high rating. If John Goodman wasn't in this film, I probably wouldn't ever watch it, but that's just me. I would say watch the film, but don't spend money on it.",The Flintstones
81,win-3,"It's not a real""Yabba-Dabba-Doo"" Time.",2,25 February 2000,"I was not barely able to sit and watch this version.I tried to find something good till the end of the film and I didn't get it,but something upset.The production should be better than of what I had seen.Liz Taylor was a special cast but the weak script and production pulled everything down.Watch the original has been enough! The episodes were good stories.Some of them couldn't be forgotten with tears in my eyes during watching a friendship between Fred and Barney,,,,Great!!!",The Flintstones
82,Don Juan-3,A Great Cartoon and surely A Cool Movie!!!,8,19 August 1999,"If you've seen the cartoon...........If you were raised up on watching it daily..........If YOU LOVED IT.... Then you must surely see this cool movie, It brings back all childhood memories of The Flint Stones Cartoon.John Goodman is one of the funniest men on earth. :0) He fits the Fred Flintstone character perfectly.That's all folks.",The Flintstones
83,jch_at_amazonuk,Can't understand the miseries voting this down,10,20 January 2019,Just rewatched it in 2019 and loved it as much when it was released. So the story is predictable (watch the cartoon series - it's a direct carry over!) but that is part of the fun. The acting is brilliant and hilarious. The special effects and the Henson models still stand up.Fantastic to see/hear voice actors from the cartoons in cameo roles and even Hanna and Barbera make onscreen appearances.,The Flintstones
84,shamrock_d,Kinda surprised ...,10,3 October 2009,"that this movie got such a low rating, but I realize expectations are different and the movie plot clicked for some while others were turned off.I remember liking this movie a lot (and I still do). I liked the cartoon series too but somehow I felt the movie was better.I could see that they tried to re-create as much of the original cartoon in the movie. When I saw John Goodman appear, I said to myself: ""Omigosh, that is Fred!"" Also, the rest just seem to fit into their parts.What I also liked was seeing the cartoon take ""solid"" form. Sure, the movements were clunkier but I was expecting this. I liked the car with the passengers using their feet. Though it didn't have the zip of the cartoon car, the semblance and feel were there. I got a kick out of the different creature machines though again different from the cartoon but ""fleshed"" out in the movie.Lots of novels turned into movies disappoint some fans and make the rest happy. I'm one of those who liked this movie version of the Flintstones, not that I haven't been disappointed before. For example, I remember reading ""Jaws"" and it really gave me the chills but the movie with the big, heavy, floppy and clumsy white shark was nowhere near the novel ... but I enjoyed the movie anyway.So, don't judge the Flintstones by the rating. Give it a try, especially if you're nostalgic about the original cartoon series.I give it a ten.",The Flintstones

89,adpolicefiles,Pretty good. Under rated by idiots.,10,31 July 2006,"Its very easy for so many idiots to put down this film but how many would appreciate that they tried to stay true to the cartoon and concept at all times? What were they expecting? Schindler's list? These snobs should stop pointing their noses towards the sky as nobody really respects them.At no point during the movie do the actors embarrass themselves in trying to portray the cartoon characters and their performances of the related roles has been excellent. All the bedrock props and environment have been fairly realistically constructed. But most importantly, like every Flintstones episode, this movie has a great story and twist. This movie is a must watch for any one who liked or followed the cartoon.",The Flintstones
90,GryByteman,"Every time I watch The Flintstones, I see new things to love",10,14 March 2014,"I agree that this is different from the cartoon, but I like the differences. That doesn't mean I like the cartoons less. I just like them both in different ways.I especially loved the moments where the music sounded just like the cartoon, when they took time to recreate frequently used images from the cartoon series.I'm old enough to remember when Flintstones and Jetsons were a Friday evening prime time staple. Our paperboy would time it so that he'd collect the 57 cent per week subscription rate from my parents just before the shows started, then leave afterward.I look forward to seeing this again in a few years.John",The Flintstones

92,lnpsolutions,What else can you say.... it was awful,1,27 November 2010,"I don't think they could have done a worse job with the casting for this movie. Rick Moranis as Barney Rubble? Seriously? Other than ""Honey I shrunk the Kids"", Rick Moranis has done nothing worthwhile in his entire acting career. This is another blunder on Moranis' resume. I didn't like John Goodman as Fred Flintstone either. Other than being overweight and slightly resembling Fred, Goodman just didn't deliver in this role. Now things get even more comical.... Rosie O'Donnell, a fat, unattractive woman, playing Betty Rubble?!? Truly amazing. Elizabeth Perkins as Wilma was the best choice out of the 4 main roles, but it still wasn't good.When you do such a horrible job of casting, it pretty much sets the stage for a disaster of a movie. The 4.6 star rating currently on here is a bit generous in my opinion.",The Flintstones
93,boone-greg,Soundtrack,4,18 September 2005,"This film has a great soundtrack. My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult was an excellent choice for this film.I wish there was a way to post a comment without rambling on and on about how great or terrible the movie is. If it was a mediocre movie it deserves a mediocre comment. Goodman is great, as he usually is. He always reminded me of Fred Flintstone, so yeah, he was well cast. Rosie O'Donnell sucks, but I can't think of a better Betty Rubble. The cartoons are much better than this movie though. Its just not the same without the cartoon voices, it just isn't the same. If you were or still are a fan of the Hanna-Barbera cartoon, this movie probably isn't for you. It's a lot like how Hollywood ruined Scooby-Doo for me, although that didn't happen for another 10 years. Meh, yabba dabba doo! its the Flintstones.",The Flintstones

The movie is fluff but very entertaining. I'm not sure what the negative reviewers were looking for in this movie. It is supposed to be a live action version of The Flintstones cartoon and that is exactly what it is.,The Flintstones
96,nibbles37,A dab'll do ya!,9,27 June 2020,"Very few probably know the history of The Flinstones and Fred's catch phrase. Fewer still can appreciate what all was involved in making this film. Only uncultured swine would rate this movie so low. Let me remind people of the target audience: CHILDREN! I was a child when I saw The Flinstones original animated show and when I saw this movie so it was very easy to enjoy both as they entertained their target audience and I was incapable of hating something for superficial reasons, as so many of the negative reviews have pointed out. Spielberg made JP and thought ""I want to make the scariest dinosaurs I can"" and then he made Flinstones and thought ""How can I make the friendliest dinosaurs?"" Dude is a damn genius and you backwoods hillbillies can't see the forest for the trees. I've seen movies put forth a tenth of the effort and get 10 stars. The costumes, the locations, the background, everything about this movie had a LOT of effort put forth to give us a great film and I think they did a fantastic job, I thought that as a kid and I think it as an adult.

100,enrisin,What an insult!,1,7 March 2000,Ok John Goodman does a good job playing Fred and the rest of the cast maybe weren't born to be some of their characters but maybe those persons haven't even been born so they do a good job. Bedrock looks OK you can easily see that they've spent a lot of time working on it trying to make it look just like the cartoon but the story compared to the one the cartoon has is a definite insult just look at the ratings that this movie has here at IMDB 4.4 right now (March 7th 2000) those guys at Universal should have back in 1993 (when they were writing the script) well the story is really bad let's make a movie combining 4 of the most popular episodes in one story that would have been a very good idea I'm sure that it would have had made much more money than the 358.5 million it made worldwide even though that is a lot I know that if they had a better story it would have like 500M or more. Maybe lots of those 358.5M are because people couldn't believe that they had made a bad movie about a family that generations have grown with. I expect something better with the prequel that is coming out this summer even though I don't think the people they chose to be the new Flintstones look like them as the first cast did.,The Flintstones
