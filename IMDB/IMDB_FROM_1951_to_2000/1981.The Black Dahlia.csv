0,TheLittleSongbird,"Interesting and well made, but rather flat and dare I say over-the-top too",4,13 February 2011,"Now I like Brian DePalma, and I love Carrie, The Untouchables and Carlito's Way. Out of the films of his I've seen, The Black Dahlia is my least favourite in my view, though I was also rather disappointed in Scarface too.I was really interested in its concept and the story seemed interesting. Also the film is very well made, with stylish cinematography and beautiful scenery, costumes, sets and makeup, DePalma's direction has occasional flashes of brilliance and the music was quite nice as well.However, this is another case of style over substance. The script falls flat, with little idea of which direction to go, and the tone of the story is also uneven with some scenes disappointingly over-the top. The characters I felt indifferent to, and I also thought they were quite shallow and poorly explored, the pace is rather meandering and with exception of Fiona Shaw who's quite good the acting is bland. Also the ending I think is overdone.All in all, interesting initially and while well made it is emotionally hollow and flat in its scripting and characterisation. 4/10 Bethany Cox",The Black Dahlia
1,Leofwine_draca,Another nail in the coffin of a one-time great,3,11 May 2011,"Despite its po-faced earnestness and basis on real-life events, THE BLACK DAHLIA is a film that's difficult to take seriously. It's another subdued, soulless effort from Brian de Palma, the director who could once do no wrong between the 1970s and the early 1990s but who now, like John Carpenter, appears to have lost the talent he once had. This is an overlong film noir, a hardboiled crime yarn featuring a pair of boxers-turned-detectives investigating the Black Dahlia murder in '40s-era Los Angeles. You can sense from the outset that de Palm's heart isn't really in it and who can blame him? He's saddled with a pair of distinctively unimpressive actors as his leads. Aaron Eckhart can be great when he wants to be (think THE DARK KNIGHT) but he can do little with the square-jawed, one-dimensional hero type he plays here. Josh Hartnett (SIN CITY) has the deeper role but didn't appear anything other than bland to this viewer. While it's nice to see Hilary Swank playing against type for once, the female lead is played by the unfortunate Scarlett Johansson, one of those actresses I feel is seriously overrated. The way she delivers some of her lines in this moviewords fail me, suffice to say she's anything but believable.The muddled plot goes through the tired old clichés, de Palma attempts to put some UNTOUCHABLES style into one slow-mo set-piece and fails, and the ending tries to tie everything up neatly in a contrived, Hollywood cliché type way. In fact it would be a good idea just to go back and watch the Kevin Costner starrer instead of this weak revisitation of a similar era.",The Black Dahlia
2,SnoopyStyle,So much style and such a mess,4,15 November 2014,"Beat cop Bucky Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) meets LAPD detective Lee Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) during a Zoot Suit riot. The higher ups come up with a fight between the two ex-boxers to drum up support for a police pay raise. They become homicide detective partners. Bucky, Lee and his girlfriend Kay Lake (Scarlett Johansson) form a love triangle. In 1947, the cops discover the mutilated body of a girl called the Black Dahlia by the press. Bucky's investigation leads to Madeleine Linscott (Hilary Swank) from a wealthy family who bears a resemblance to the Black Dahlia.This movie has style to spare. Brian De Palma has stuffed it overflowing with style. It is a gorgeous movie to look at. The story is another ... story. It is a mess. I don't know why the movie spends so much time with the boxing or the leads dancing around. The story is begging to be a hard-boiled police investigation. It gets bog down with all kinds of unnecessary junk. The actors are generally good enough but Hartnett does come off a little stiff. Mia Kirshner does a good turn as the sad murdered beauty Elizabeth Short. Somehow watching her in black and white makes it very compelling.",The Black Dahlia
3,claudio_carvalho,Nothing Stays Buried Forever,7,8 July 2007,"In 1946, the former boxers Dwight ""Bucky"" Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) and Lee Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) are policemen in Los Angeles. Lee has a good relationship with his chief and uses a box fight between them to promote the department and get a raise to the police force. They succeed and are promoted to homicide detectives, working together. Bucky becomes a close friend of Lee and his girlfriend Kay Lake (Scarlett Johansson), forming a triangle of love. When the corpse of the aspirant actress Elizabeth Short (Mia Kishner) is found mutilated, Lee becomes obsessed to solve the case called by the press Black Dahlia. Meanwhile, Bucky's investigation leads him to a Madeleine Linscott (Hilary Swank), the daughter of a powerful and wealthy constructor that resembles the Black Dahlia. In a environment of corruption and lies, Bucky discloses hidden truths.I heard many bad comments of ""Black Dahlia"" from my friends and co-workers, and only today I have decided to watch this film. The story is confused because there are many simultaneous situations and all the characters tell lies and are dirty; there are flaws since characters are killed without consequences for the killer; but the cinematography is wonderful, the cast is a dream and the director is Brian De Palma, one of my favorites. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Dália Negra"" (""Black Dahlia"")",The Black Dahlia

6,kosmasp,L.A. Confidential this ain't,5,9 May 2007,"Yes the novel is by James Ellroy, but the movie doesn't even come near the quality of L.A. Confidential. Since I haven't read neither of the novels, I can't say if it's about the original material. But still there could've been a better movie. And it doesn't even start of as badly, as it then gets.Aaron Eckhart might be the best thing of the movie, but still he even sometimes seems misplaced in the picture. Scralett Johansson is playing cold ... let's assume that was the direction, but it still doesn't feel right. Josh Hartnett is the lead, but you never get this vibe from his performance. One also wonders what Hillary Swank is doing here (quite literally) ... and although the names sound good, they don't taste as good, when served (especially when they're cold)! The 40s setting doesn't help and the irritating story lines just annoy you even more. Still a few things here, are to like. Maybe the source was good then and it did deserve a better treatment!",The Black Dahlia
7,classicsoncall,"""Nothing stays buried forever.""",8,16 August 2012,"I'm not understanding the preponderance of negatives for this film. Yes, the story can be difficult to follow, but a lot can be said for paying attention. I just looked up some information on the real Black Dahlia murder case of 1947, and knowing some of those details makes it clear that they don't have any bearing on what happens in this film. The revelation of Elizabeth Short's murderer in the story comes out of left field and isn't really consistent with that of a demented sexual predator, just a demented wife who went crazy over her husband's indiscretions. A little more about that later.What might be helpful for viewers on the fence, catch the film a second time after it becomes clear that Lee Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) and girlfriend Kay (Scarlett Johannsen) stole the money from the Boulevard Citizen Bank heist. From there, the picture becomes Lee's obsession not only to solve the Dahlia case, but to save his own neck as well. The subtle intricacies of the Baxter Finch sub-plot is a nifty red herring thrown into the mix that doesn't have anything to do with Betty Short's murder, but does lend further credence to Blanchard's being a dirty cop who was also blackmailing Emmett Linscott (John Kavanagh) over the porn film business. It's an intricate web that takes some time to unravel, but the payoff is worth the effort.Back to Ramona Linscott, man, what a nutcase she was. I thought Fiona Shaw's portrayal was too over the top during my first viewing of the film, but once she confesses to the murder it all makes sense. Remember when she was up there on the balcony laying out that whole Georgie rap on Bucky Bleichert (Josh Hartnett)? I thought she was going to fall off the handrail and do a swan dive to the floor like poor Lee earlier in the picture. Wouldn't that have been something? Instead she takes the pipe quite literally, and for her final act it struck me as totally in character.Generally I prefer my film noir in black and white, and that would have been a neat way to go, but since it didn't, you can still take delight in the flawed femme fatale character of Madeleine Linscott (Hilary Swank) who would have fit right in with the likes of Barbara Stanwyck, Gene Tierney and Ida Lupino back in the day. Except she wasn't a blonde. But Kay was, and you have to take it on faith that Johannson's character was written as a subliminal tribute to Veronica Lake, who made her mark in the noir genre with a dahlia picture of her own. That one was blue.",The Black Dahlia
8,gavin6942,"A Gritty, Glorious Film... But Better Films From These Creators Exist",7,19 February 2007,"Two detectives are put on the case of the Black Dahlia murder. While tracking down the killer as partners, they also must face each other as rivals for the woman they both love.The marketing for this film was misleading, let me say that first of all. The film appeared to be something like a horror film in the trailers, but really has no horror elements at all (despite the grotesque murder of Betty Short). Furthermore, the assumption is that the film would be about the Black Dahlia (with a title like ""The Black Dahlia) but this was really a background issue to the romance storyline.It could have been a horror film, but wasn't. As my friend Trixie said, it was ""one Chinaman short of a horror film."" You take that to mean whatever you choose.The creative forces behind this are some of the best. Directed by Brian dePalma (""Scarface"", ""Untouchables"", ""Carrie"", and the Courtney Cox favorite ""Dancing in the Dark"") and written by James Ellroy (""LA Confidential""). I'm not a biog enough follower of dePalma to really pinpoint his stylistic work in this, but Ellroy's work is clear: like ""La Confidential"", there are multiple layers of storyline, and you're not likely to get everything in the first viewing.Ellroy's intricacies were actually my biggest problem with the film. For a city as large as Los Angeles, there seem to be a surprisingly small amount of people who do anything in this film, and things are more interconnected than one would imagine. How are murder, real estate, film-making and child molesting connected? You'll find out by the end of this one...But, if I suspend my beliefs, this is a beautiful work of art. The acting is great, the directing wonderful. The lighting is the best, giving the film a gritty, back alley appearance... the world of pimps and gangs like one would imagine it to be.Scarlett Johannsen was very good, though I don't know if she was the right one for this role. Josh Hartnett, in contrast, was perfect. A few years ago I would have said he would never amount to anything beyond a pretty boy, but this film says otherwise: he is a strong lead and carries the full maturity and seriousness of a seasoned actor. (While retaining those looks for the ladies.) The film is a bit slower than most, as there is much to digest in the short time we have to feast upon it. But if you are patient and perceptive, this is the film for you. (If you need constant stimulation, you'll fall asleep.) Give me a second viewing, and I might even give the film an 8. (My opinion was skewed in that I didn't know the proper mindset with which to enter the film.)",The Black Dahlia
9,lee_eisenberg,Do people really have sex on tables?,5,3 February 2007,"I have long said that ""Carlito's Way"" was Brian DePalma's last really good movie. I'm afraid that ""The Black Dahlia"" reaffirms this. The movie focuses on the unsolved murder of Elizabeth Ann Short in 1947 Los Angeles. Or at least that's what the movie claims to be doing. Although the movie poses some interesting questions about the circumstances, it suffers from some problems.First, there's the casting of Josh Hartnett. Up to now, he's only starred in movies like ""Pearl Harbor"", so it's hard to take him seriously as a detective trying to solve a murder in a film noir setting. Second, while I really like Scarlett Johansson as an actress, they misuse her here: she becomes less of a character and more like a piece of scenery (it seems like they were trying to have her channel Kim Basinger's character in ""LA Confidential""; no one should attempt that).I should say that this isn't a terrible movie; plenty of flicks have come out far worse than this. One of the movie's good aspects is that it poses the question of cover-ups in the police force (which wouldn't surprise me at all). But many of the events portrayed here seem like they happen for no reason; I couldn't understand much of what Aaron Eckhart's character did throughout the movie. As for the whole part about Hilary Swank's character's possible lesbianism, they didn't make it's significance very clear.So, this is one movie that has it's visuals, if absolutely nothing else. I don't recommend it as your first choice. I don't know whether or not I would have given it its Oscar nomination. Also starring Mia Kirshner and Troy Evans.PS: That sex-on-the-table scene made me wonder something. Do people really do that? It seems like it would be uncomfortable.",The Black Dahlia
10,jboothmillard,The Black Dahlia,5,1 July 2010,"I really only heard of this film because of some of the cast members, the genre, and the fact that it was directed by Brian De Palma (Scarface, The Untouchables). Based on a real unsolved murder, set in the 1940s, Los Angeles policemen and former boxers Officer Dwight 'Bucky' Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) and Sergeant Leland 'Lee' Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) are investigating a death. Aspiring actress Elizabeth Short aka The Black Dahlia (Mia Kirshner) has been found brutally murdered, and the two newly promoted homicide detectives are obsessed in the case. Lee meanwhile is in a relationship with girlfriend Kay Lake (Scarlett Johansson), but a triangle of love is forming as Bucky is gaining feelings for her. These feelings may be swaying away as his investigation leads him to daughter of a wealthy businessman, Madeleine Linscott (Hilary Swank) who is a near striking resemblance to The Black Dahlia. It all comes to a head with numerous characters come out with their facts that may mean their involvement with the murder, but no true suspect can found, and never is. Also starring Dumb and Dumber's Mike Starr as Det. Russ Millard, Harry Potter's Fiona Shaw as Ramona Linscott, Scream's Rose McGowan as Sheryl Saddon, Ian McNeice as Coroner, Kevin Dunn as Elizabeth Short's Father and k.d. lang as Lesbian Bar Singer. Hartnett, Eckhart, Johansson and Swank all do pretty well in their roles, De Palma does his best as well, it might not have been a completely thrilling crime drama, but you can try it. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Cinematography. Worth watching!",The Black Dahlia
11,ccthemovieman-1,"Great Start, Horrible Finish",5,25 January 2007,"The first 45 minutes of this was a very, very pleasant surprise. That's probably because I read so many negative things about this film, I was expecting the worst. I was enthused, even heading into the second hour but as time went on I began to become less involved with the story. That's probably because none of the characters are likable people that I would care about. With no one to really root, after awhile the movie loses its appeal. The worst part was the last 20 minutes. It was so sordid, it got absurd. It's too much corruption, sick people, ugly violence and nasty overall attitude. The ""Linscott"" family is so bad I could do little but just shake my head in disgust. The whole thing wound up too depressing. When it's over, you want to take a shower. I loved the cinematography and overall 1940s film noir atmosphere. On that aspect alone, this movie almost was a keeper until they went overboard on the seedy stuff in the last 20 minutes. What a shame: this film had such potential.",The Black Dahlia
12,rmax304823,Boring.,2,26 June 2007,"It's hard to tell just what went wrong in this picture. The director pulled off at least one or two films that had tension and continuity. The performers have all done first-rate work elsewhere. I've especially enjoyed Scarlett Johansson because of her improbable material attributes. I mean, there she is, one of those bosomy Scandinavian blonds, with her slanted almond eyes, her voice a combination of croak and lisp (""She had a thithster""), and great big red lips like those on a Rolling Stones T-shirt. And Josh Hartnett, the very model of a modern bland noir hero. And Hillary Swank with incisors that were never subject to domestication. A lush score. Splendid visuals.But they don't add up to a story, let alone a story about the Black Dahlia murder case, about which we don't learn or see very much. The plot meanders all over the place and leaves ox-bow lakes behind. There were moments when, as in a Raymond Chandler story, I couldn't tell who was killing whom or why.A voice-over narration is ordinarily a kind of last-ditch effort to tie events together, as it is here, and sometimes it fails, as it does here. At other times it may be the only way to get the writer's distinctive style across, as with many of Chandler's stories. ""The heat made you itch,"" an approximation of one of Chandler's tropes, is impossible to catch on film. But here? ""I wondered why she hadn't told me about it."" It serves only as a fill-in for notions that should have been conveyed cinematically. Well, I'll give an example of what I mean.Hartnett discovers he's been betrayed by his partner, storms into the men's room and pops him on the jaw, knocking him down, then leans over a sink and shouts an oath. In the next scene the narration tells us that Hartnett suffered a sprained wrist and two dislocated knuckles from throwing that punch. It must have hurt like hell. Why didn't Hartnett do something recherche, like howling with pain, squatting on the floor and cradling his broken hand? A good movie is made up of small original elements like that, as well as the big slow-motion action sequences that DePalma finds so attractive. By the way, DePalma is the voice of the director in the scenes involving Elizabeth Short's auditions, and although it's only a voice it may be the truest simple thing in the film. DePalma sounds like hundreds of others of those sleazebag skin-flick producers and directors who conducted ""interviews"" of gals with breasts like basketballs of about ten years ago. ""So where are you from? Sioux Falls? Do all the babes in Sioux Falls have hooters as big as yours? Let's take a look at them. Yeah, that's right. Take that thing off. Ewwww. Do you know what this is?"" Oh, that reminds me. This is a DePalma movie, right? And with two succulent actresses? So why can't we have more gratuitous nudity and sex? Is that too much to ask for? Given that the movie has so little else to offer? This should be studied in film schools, maybe frame by frame. It seemed to have everything going for it and it simply did not work. How come?",The Black Dahlia
13,Tweekums,Solution to an unsolved case,7,20 December 2009,"I must confess that by the time I got to the end of this film I was a bit disappointed, I knew before watching it that it was based on a real unsolved murder case so didn't think it was good that in the film it was solved it was as if the writer thought the audience wouldn't be able to cope without a sense of resolution at the end. As well as being unnecessary the ending seemed somewhat melodramatic.Up until the end I enjoyed the film, finding the main characters interesting, having a good film noir feel about them. The two leading characters are Los Angeles police officers who are also boxers after a bout between the two they find themselves working together rounding up criminals with outstanding warrants. While serving once such warrant they are on site when a woman's mutilated body is found, Officer Blanchard is determined to take on the case despite his partner, Officer Bleichert being less than enthusiastic. Matters are confused when Bleichert gets involved with a woman who resembles the victim and Blanchard has problems when a man who had caused problems in his past is released from prison.Brian De Palma did a good job capturing the feel of post war Los Angeles or at least the feel of it from films of the time. I thought Josh Hartnett and Aaron Eckhart were fine as the two policeman caught up in a world were corruption is rife, indeed they might not be above taking a few bucks on the side themselves. The leading ladies didn't have much of a role although I suspect that was largely because neither were really femme fatales and film noir has little place for ordinary women. While I enjoyed it enough I'd choose ""LA Confidential"" over this if I were to pick one James Ellroy adaptation.",The Black Dahlia
14,moonspinner55,Playing dress-up...,2,8 April 2011,"It's Hollywood 1947, and two Los Angeles policeman (one with dirty hands, the other secretly involved with his partner's girlfriend) begin falling apart personally and professionally as their investigation into the brutal murder of an aspiring actress appears to be going nowhere. Inspired by the grisly real-life case of Elizabeth Short, found mutilated in an empty lot, this muddled, misguided faux-noir not only fails to shine any light on that incident--it besmirches the name of the deceased in the bargain! Director Brian De Palma's intentions seem true enough; while trying to invoke vintage detective yarns from Hollywood's past, he has stylized his picture to a late-night fare-thee-well. Unfortunately, De Palma's casting choices seem designated for box-office appeal, and very few of these actors match up well with their characters. Hilary Swank is decent as a would-be shady lady (with lesbian leanings), and Aaron Eckhart manages to convey the desperation of his conflicted cop well enough, but Josh Hartnett is a block of wood in the central role. Mia Kirshner plays Short as a pathetic hanger-on using sex as a stepping stone, however her ""screen tests"" (which were not a part of James Ellroy's source novel) are ridiculous, and in these cases De Palma's directorial judgment is clearly in question. The filmmaker's rhythm also seems off in the final third, with the climactic events buried underneath one miscalculation after another. *1/2 from ****",The Black Dahlia
15,blanche-2,lost its way before it started,5,23 September 2014,"The only thing I got out of this is that Scarlett Johannson should at some point play Lana Turner.""The Black Dahlia"" is a 2006 Brian De Palma film starring Josh Hartnett, Aaron Eckhart, Scarlett Johannson, and Hillary Swank.However, don't let the title fool you. The 67-year-old unsolved Black Dahlia murder is only a subplot in this film, which primarily seems to be about the relationship between two former fighters turned homicide detectives, Bucky (Hartnett) and Lee Eckhart), and Lee's girlfriend Kay (ScarJo).In working on the Black Dahlia case in 1947 Los Angeles, Dwight gets mixed up with a wealthy but whacked out family, the Linscotts, where one of the daughters (Swank) resembles the Dahlia. Hillary Swank is a wonderful actress and a lovely woman, but she's not sexy, and I really didn't pick up any chemistry between her and Hartnett.The photography, atmosphere, and '40s depictions are of the highest quality. The story is gritty,slow, convoluted, and you really don't care about any of the characters. Style over substance.",The Black Dahlia
16,Quinoa1984,"that kind of cinematic car wreck that only Brian De Palma, as a sometimes great filmmaker, can achieve",5,16 September 2006,"I don't think that the Black Dahlia is the worst film I've seen in the director Brian De Palma's long career (that might go to Mission to Mars or Snake Eyes, and I've yet to see his other so-called 'mess' The Bonfire of the Vanities), but coming from someone who usually has such a magnificent, wild knack for film-noir it's a disappointment. And it might also come as a disappointment to fans of the book by James Ellroy, though if it overall will be I can't say. It's a work by a director who has so much confidence- bordering on arrogance now in mis 60s- in his grandiose style and almost always moving camera that he never has to second guess himself. But there in lies part of the problem, a big one, that he maybe didn't give enough time to actually let the material all sink in. He also doesn't really know how to reel in two very important parts of a production like this one- the right cast, and a coherent script. I know there was a story going on in the film, but it's surrounded by plot- lots of plot- that never comes together. Individual scenes and some actors do stand out, however never totally for something that really works completely. After a while the convoluted plot(s) aren't necessary to figure out, but even the cheap joys of watching a packed-homage work like this starts to wear off. Josh Hartnett is possibly one of the bigger problems, though maybe not the biggest. He can sometimes be OK in some performances, and his bit in Sin City does show that, in limited time, he can have some style in his work. But here he has to really show more emotion, with more believability, than in his past movie roles. And, of course, there are times when he has to cry, to get really angry, suspicious, figuring stuff out, confused, and a couple of moments might work but it really doesn't at the same time. This is mirrored by the usually very good Scarlett Johanssen, who here is really the tricky wife of Hartnett's partner in law, played in a very one-note turn by Aaron Eckhart (we get it, you're on Benzedrine, you're angry and mad, not much to do). Here too I see some good scenes with her, but then there are more lesser ones where the sort of shallow space around her starts to creep in. It's decent, but far from memorable work like in other recent performances from her. And Hilary Swank, as the femme fatale of the story, is actually not terrible either for what she's worth, though one might think as to why they casted her as a look-a-like of Elizabeth Short (Mia Kirshner), as she doesn't really. Her's is a character that really does have potential, but again gets mired in the muck of the varying plot-lines.And the plot is one I almost can't really describe. Not necessarily because I would spoil anything, but because it would take too long. There's one that involves Eckhart's character and an old rival just released from prison. There's a left-over one of Hartnett and Eckhart as boxers. And Swank and her father and mother get one too. And it all is supposed to come together nicely with the more deep-dish side of the story, where Short is murdered gruesomely. On top of leaving some of these plot-lines, so to speak, at room temperature from the old-movie catalog (of course, only 25% I would figure is based on fact), the dialog from Josh Friedman's script gives not as much style and interest as De Palma's un-stoppable camera. Here, of course, it IS all-in-all a De Palma film, and even in a mess of such where he sometimes has to overcompensate for the script with his high-wire long-takes (one of them as the two policemen wait in the car, as it pulls up to see another crime scene and then pulls back, is actually pretty awesome), circling pans, changing color tones, etc, there is some OK stuff.For example, I got a big kick out of seeing one of the stars from De Palma's 70's work, William Finley, in a certain part wielding a wire-throat-cutter. And Kirsher as Short, in scenes in black and white with De Palma himself voicing the audition-man behind her screen tests, are quite good. The start of the film too, like with Snake Eyes, is promising, with a boxing sequence that isn't half bad. But in the end, the Black Dahlia is too big, too flashy, overloaded with enough plot to last two movies, and characters who only fit the actors playing them to a certain point and when that point is crossed, which happens about more or less halfway into the movie, it becomes reckless. I'm sure De Palma junkies will be rushing to see it, yet casual moviegoers possibly going just on the basis of the actors may be in for a surprise (maybe not a good one). There's some good stuff, perhaps in search of a better script, and the flaws end up outweighing what might have been a decent crime-murder-mystery. And the more I thought about it after leaving the theater, the less and less of it I thought was really even worthy of the director's talents; it's not one of the worst films I've seen this year, but coming from such a hit or miss auteur it's safe to say it's one of his misses.

17,michaelRokeefe,California's most shocking unsolved murder mystery.,7,27 December 2006,"The much acclaimed Brian De Palma directs this interesting tale inspired by a most horrid unsolved murder; and based on a novel by James Ellroy. Fact, fiction, myth, fantasy; maybe a little dab of each with do ya. Two ambitious homicide detectives(Josh Hartnett and Aaron Eckhart)investigate, with fervor, the brutal slaying of a fledgling Hollywood starlet Elizabeth Short(Mia Kirshner). The eager Miss Short is said to have made ""nudie"" stag movies and prostituted before her grisly attack. Making the investigation interesting is a beautiful girlfriend(Scarlett Johansson), a shameless bi-sexual femme fatale(Hilary Swank) and a deranged wealthy woman(Fiona Shaw). Thus is proof that the sensational 1947 murder mystery still sustains opinions and imaginations. A few grisly and disturbing images along with strong violence and sexual situations keep this drama glued together. A great escape and well worth the two hour run time.

18,sunwarrior13,A Soap Opera Rather Than A Well-crafted Crime Thriller,7,15 October 2012,"Director Brian De Palma returns to the helm for the first time since 2002's Femme Fatale with this stylish screen adaptation of James Ellroy's novel detailing one of the most notorious unsolved murders in Hollywood history in this movie entitled,The Black Dahlia.It stars Josh Hartnett, Scarlett Johansson, Aaron Eckhart and Hilary Swank. The story is based on the murder of Elizabeth Short. Elizabeth Short was a struggling actress looking to make a name for herself in 1940s-era Tinseltown. Unfortunately for Elizabeth, it was her grim fate that would ultimately overshadow anything she would accomplish during her short and tragic career. When police discover Elizabeth's body cut clean in half and with all of her organs missing, ex-pugilist detectives Lee Blanchard and Bucky Bleichert are the men charged with cracking the case and apprehending the killer. This isn't your average murder case, however, and as Blanchard's marriage to Kay begins to suffer due to his obsession with the sensational crime, his partner Bleichert discovers a troubling link between the victim and the mysterious Madeleine Linscott, a prominent socialite and the daughter of one of the town's most connected key players.Despite genius-level contributions from cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond and art director Dante Ferretti, the handsome film is almost abusively murky, trafficking in difficult-to-follow plot manipulations, arbitrary twists and mumbled dialogue.Added to that,De Palma and his collaborators have been unable to translate Mr. Ellroy's depth of feeling into cinematic equivalents.Too bad that a stellar cast of marquee names, coupled with an all-star crew, can't make this entry work.With skeletons flying out of the closet at every turn, this over plotted mess unfolds more like a dumb, daytime soap opera than a well-crafted crime thriller.",The Black Dahlia
19,hitchcockthelegend,I have been pointing my gun at a lot of people this week.,7,7 September 2015,"A box office failure and a neo-noir film that confounded critics and fans alike, The Black Dahlia now appears to be a pic that has had its strengths ignored. As the clamour to kick Brian De Palma continues unabated to this day, and the point blank refusal to accept that Josh Hartnett is a better actor than the likes of Pearl Harbor suggests, it's a film worthy of a revisit by genre/style fans alike. Plot revolves around the infamous murder of one Elizabeth Short in Hollywood, 1947. An aspiring actress who was found butchered and her murder to this day remains unsolved. De Palma and his writer Josh Friedman adapt from noir legend James Ellroy's novel of the same name, the crux of the story is about two hot-to-trot detectives who get involved in the Short case, and pretty soon there is a can of worms that has been shaken and opened, and there's dizzying worms everywhere - we think? De Palma loves noir, he has dabbled with it for a long time, not all of it works, but often he delivers for like minded cinephiles. With expectation levels high and following in the slipstream of the critical darling that was L.A. Confidential, Black Dahlia never really had a hope of achieving its lofty ambitions, yet it's a tremendously realised picture from a noir stand point. Whilst it showcases the technical wizardry of the director. The charges of it being convoluted are fair, it's a spinning narrative, stories within stories, characterisations obtuse, but so was The Big Sleep! I know, I know, this is not fit to lace the boots of Hawks' genius movie, but tricksy narratives have always been a fundamental part of many a film noir, so why the distaste for this one? Especially since the period design, costuming, styling, photography and characterisations are so rich in detail? For instance Hartnett's detective is gumshoe nirvana, while Scarlett Johansson and Hilary Swank fatale the femme with mischievous glee. But of course De Palma then spells it out for the finale, explaining things, a sort of macabre wrap up for those that needed it. Either way he was never going to win, it's too complex, it didn't need spelling out, while Mr. De Palma we have to tell you that your characters have been too cold, we don't feel them?! Huh? This is noirville, a place frequented by bad people, idiots and hapless dreamers, of dupes and double crossers. Hell there's even a suggestion of necrophiliac tendencies in this, and that's before we even delve into the machinations of the two femme fatales, a family that's lacking Adams Family Values and coppers of dubious motives. Yeah, it's cold, and yes De Palma is guilty of trying to please all parties by covering all bases, but it's far from being a stinker. Haters of De Palma, Hartnett and complex noir narratives can knock two points off of my own personal rating, otherwise it's 7/10.",The Black Dahlia
20,Doylenf,It's not noir and it's not true DePalma...,5,20 September 2006,"To say that I was disappointed is an understatement. For all the rich texture of the monochromatic cinematography (so we'd know we're watching a modern film noir), all the posturing of SCARLETT JOHANSSON with her long cigarette holder, all the fake glamor of HILLARY SWANK, and all the convoluted plot lines, it's hard to find a trace of the Elizabeth Short story here. It's really just a sideshow to the very complicated characters and situations that exist outside the fictionalized story of THE BLACK DAHLIA, a murder never actually solved.While watching it unfold, I couldn't help thinking how much better this would have been as a gritty film noir back in the '40s in the sort of B&W photography that Michael Curtiz used for THE UNSUSPECTED--and with an actor like Humphrey Bogart as the lead detective with either Lauren Bacall or Lizabeth Scott as the femme fatale. And if they needed a brunette siren they could always use Marie Windsor. Swank really has done better work elsewhere.Furthermore, the story chosen from the James Elroy novel which does give a solution to the crime, is an absurd one that is not made even remotely believable by the creation of the Fiona SHAW character who seems to be existing in another movie--a farce. Nor is the narration spoken by JOSH HARTNETT in a careless monotone that I found alienating any help in explaining the twisted course of events.DePalma missed the opportunity in bringing the Elizabeth Short story to the screen as stark drama in any way that makes sense. Because of its assured style, it's a very watchable film despite all the flaws--and you keep thinking something better will happen in the last thirty minutes to explain motives and to close in on the final chapter of Short's life, but no--no such luck. It fizzles to a conclusion with some musical orchestrations that attempt (all the way through the film) to give everything more significance. Alas, even Mark Isham's bombastic score doesn't work although it sounds good over the closing credits.It's a classic example of style over substance, but this time the style can't hide the fact that the script is largely incomprehensible and goes far astray of its subject matter.",The Black Dahlia
21,preppy-3,"Maybe there's something wrong with me, but I LIKED this",7,21 September 2006,"Fictional movie based on a real unsolved Hollywood murder in the 1940s. The mutilated body of Elizabeth Short (Mia Kirschner) is found in an empty lot. Officer Dwight Bleichert (Josh Harnett) and Sgt. Leland Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) are assigned to the case. Blanchard becomes obsessed with the case causing troubles with his girlfriend Kay Lake (Scarlett Johansson). She then falls for Bleichert. Then there are more murders and lesbians and incest are thrown in... The plot is a little too convoluted but so was the book (by Jack Ellroy). To be totally honest I can't understand why this is getting blasted by the critics. It's no masterpiece but it's 100 times better than director Brian DePalma's last film (2002's terrible ""Femme Fatale"") and probably his best work since 1996's ""Mission Impossible"". The 1940s setting is beautifully captured with clothes and settings--this film really looks great. DePalma once again gives us some incredible visual sequences--one murder is downright terrifying and one of the best things he's done in years. Also the plot, while involved, does reach a logical, satisfying conclusion. However the film isn't perfect.There's a lesbian bar here that's really overdone. It's beautiful, with a ridiculously elaborate stage show--but in 1940s Hollywood? I don't think so. The acting is all over the place. Eckhart OVERACTS to a ridiculous degree. Hartnett is terrible (no surprise there) but so are Johansson and Hilary Swank (both wonderful actresses). It seems like Harnett's presence bring them down to his level of non acting. Last, and least, is English actress Fiona Lewis who is certainly acting but not in this picture. She overdoes it so much she makes Eckhart look restrained. So I DID like it but with a tighter story and a better leading man this might have been great. As it stands it's a very good, well-made movie with some questionable acting. I give it a 7.",The Black Dahlia
22,dbborroughs,Dull,3,24 September 2006,"This mystery set around the infamous Black Dahlia case is a dud. It looks great but beyond that there isn't much to recommend it. The plot concerns two detectives and how the search for the killer pulls them down the rabbit hole of Los Angeles seedier side. Its film noir done with a modern sensibility.Honestly there isn't much that can be said about the film thats constructive. As an exercise on shot composition this film is top shelf. Everything looks picture perfect and completely unreal, even the actors. Director Brian De Palma seems to have chosen his actors based on their ability to look good rather than actually turn in a performance. Sure some people give something resembling a performance, however the majority simply seem to be play acting in a tough hardboiled crime drama with the result that you don't believe it for a second, nor do you care.Without any sort of hook it becomes boring. I'm a huge DePalma fan and while he's made some clunkers this is the first time he's ever turned in a dull film.This is a sleeper, as in insomniacs now have a new film to put them to sleep.

23,Bunuel1976,"THE BLACK DAHLIA (Brian De Palma, 2006) ***",7,13 October 2006,"This is a solid crime thriller but no classic: certainly not up to the standards of the similar L.A. CONFIDENTIAL (1997). De Palma was an ideal choice for director, even if there's only a few of his trademark visual flourishes (most notably when the mutilated body of the titular character is discovered and Aaron Eckhart's staircase demise). With respect to the male protagonists, Hartnett was decent but way too young, whereas Eckhart tended to overact; as for the female leads: Scarlett Johansson's role was underwritten, while Hilary Swank made a flashy hedonistic socialite with lesbian tendencies (in fact, it's Mia Kershner who comes off best as the murdered girl - as seen in some clever black-and-white 'footage' also featuring De Palma's own voice!). Typical of the genre, the film's convoluted plot comes together neatly by the end. The references to the Expressionist Silent classic THE MAN WHO LAUGHS (1928), especially in the way these feature in the mystery, were unexpected but nicely handled all around - if a little far-fetched (not least in the probably unrealistic fact that the film was conveniently given a post-WWII re-issue which our hero cops manged to catch!). Among the supporting characters, William Finley (the titular 'monster' of De Palma's PHANTOM OF THE PARADISE [1974]) was welcome as the sinister and deformed sleazeball but Swank's crazy mother is an outrageous caricature (who seems to have stepped in from some John Waters movie)! In the end, Vilmos Zsigmond's classy cinematography emerges as the film's one major asset...but I also need to point out that the film evoked great nostalgia for me personally, as it brought back memories of landmarks such as Hollywood Boulevard and the Pantages Theatre, which I vividly recall from my 3-month stay in L.A. late last year!!",The Black Dahlia

For a forties LA-based thriller that wasn't actually MADE in the forties you have to go back to LA Confidential which is also light years etcetera, ecetera. LA Confidential featured people who could actually ACT instead of just eye-candy reading Autocues. Josh Hartnett may be a babe magnet but he has all the charisma of an unlanced boil whilst the allegedly 'sexy' Scarlett Johanson is about as sexy as a soiled dressing. The one decent actor on view is also the most sensual and that would be Hilary Swank hands down.

It certainly was no Chinatown - I really don't know what it was or what it was trying to be. Maybe it was DePalma direction. He certainly deserves another Razzie for this piece. Aaron Eckhart, who did a superb job in Thank You for Smoking, seemed really weird here. Josh Hartnett seemed miscast - too young for a film noir role.

27,Boba_Fett1138,Still a must-see for the De Palma fans.,7,27 July 2009,"Well, I have a weak for De Palma movie's, even though I'm the first to admit that he has also done some bad movies throughout. But I even like watching those movies, since all of his movies often have an unique way of storytelling and always bring a couple of memorable and well constructed sequences to the screen.It's easy to tell from pretty early on in the movie that this movie is not really going to be a great. From the first moment on the story-telling is a bit too much all over the place and the movie throughout often looses its focus. It doesn't really manage to stay put to its main-plot and it for some reason feels the need to fill the movie with all kinds of uninteresting and above all unnecessary side tracks. Seriously, how is the whole triangular affair within this movie relevant for its plot? What even is supposed to be the main plot of the movie? It takes a while for the movie to make you understand which direction it's heading into with its story.Like lots of De Palma movies, the movie also has some twists in it but with as a big difference this time that none of those moments really come as a surprise and those that come unexpectedly just seem too uninteresting to leave an impression.It's easy to tell that De Palma with this movie tried to make a modern type of film-noir. His passion for the 'older' movies often shows in all of his movies and with this movie he really goes back to the old days of pure film-noir film-making. However the movie is not really atmospheric enough to call its look and atmosphere effective. This of course also has to do with the fact that this movie got shot in color, instead of the always far more effective, for these type of movies, black & white.Nevertheless as the movie progressed it managed to create a style on its own and the movie becomes a more pleasant one to watch as well. I really wouldn't call this movie a bad one, since it has plenty of redeeming qualities in it, which makes this a good movie to watch and not just for the De Palma fans. It was great to see a couple of real typical, well build-up, De Palma sequences in this. It's nothing too original from him but in my eyes it remained a great pleasure. Real De Palma fans will recognize these moments I'm talking about.The movie has a rather good cast as well, with 'hot' actors such as Josh Hartnett, Scarlett Johansson, Aaron Eckhart, Hilary Swank, Mia Kirshner, Fiona Shaw all present. It shows that Hollywood actors are still very much willing to work with a craftsman such as Brian De Palma, who has some great movies behind his name.Not entirely successful as a movie but still simply a good one, thanks to De Palma's talents.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Black Dahlia
28,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Brilliant,8,16 December 2009,"I have not read the novel, though I might consider doing so. If you are to take one thing from the numerous negative reviews, it is probably that this is simply not for everyone. It is a modern produced Noir film, and in that regard, it is spot-on. The plot is complex, the dialog is excellent, the mystery is engaging and full of twists, and last but most definitely not least, the look, including lighting, costumes, sets, etc., is absolutely *gorgeous*. Hartnett is not exactly known for his stellar performances, though he has proved himself here and there; he's average in this. The rest of the cast do well, and the level of quality of the acting is in general nice and high. This can be pretty disturbing and unpleasant at times, and you do have to pay close attention to completely follow it, and to ""get"" everything. At times this can be pretty funny, and it's certainly never boring. De Palma remains a master storyteller. There is some grisly and brutal violence, a bit of sexual content including nudity of both genders, as well as relatively frequent moderate to strong language in this. The DVD comes with a couple of trailers. I recommend this to any and all fans of the sub-genre, James Ellroy and/or the director. 8/10",The Black Dahlia
29,george.schmidt,"De Palma and Ellroy: Match made in Heaven? No, more like Hell!",1,18 September 2006,"THE BLACK DAHLIA (2006) * Josh Hartnett, Scarlett Johansson, Aaron Eckhart, Hilary Swank, Mia Kirshner, Mike Starr, Fiona Shaw. De Palma and Ellroy: Match made in Heaven? No, more like Hell!You would think that the paring up of controversial '70s auteur Brian De Palma and edgy crime novelist James Ellroy would be a perfect match of their sordid sensibilities right? A match made in Heaven, yes? No. More like a match made in Hell.The novelization of the infamous ""Black Dahlia"" murder mystery - which actually happened and still to this day remains unsolved - is fictionalized into the pulp noir of Ellroy's story of two up-and-coming cops, Officer Dwight ""Bucky"" (Mr. Ice) (Hartnett) and Sgt. Leland ""Lee"" (Mr. Fire) (Eckhart), who become buddies and partners after an unlikely set-up involving a charity boxing match where Lee knocks out Bucky's front teeth, and then invites him post-bout to his home that he shares with the comely Kay Lake. Eventually the couple ask their new friend to move into their designer friendly digs and set up a cozy game of playing house: Kay cooks for the duo as they solve their crimes.Then the pair are hip-deep suddenly in investigating the brutal slaying of one Elizabeth Short (Kirshner), a wanna-be actress, whose corpse is discovered to be cut cleanly in half, disemboweled and disgraced with a horrid slash from ear- to-ear in a nasty, rictus smile. Needless to say their superiors want a swift resolution to this heinous crime and the boys knuckle down to do just that.Well so far so good right? Wrong. It begins to come clear to Bucky that the late Ms. Short was involved with some apparently lurid after-hours soirees among the chichi hoi-polloi and a lesbian who became involved with a rich-bitch bisexual named Madeleine Linscott (Swank, attempting to channel a Katherine Hepburnian accent of blue-blood aristocracy) who is more than she appears to be. Meanwhile Lee is obsessed with Smart as well trying to come to grips with the blue material he has been given to sort through, reflecting poorly with his work habits and domestic standings with Kay (who are both harboring a secret they attempt to exclude Bucky from).The plottings that intertwine by the screenplay by Josh Friedman's adaptation are ludicrously boring and serve no purpose especially since the juicy Jack-the- Ripperian crime is pretty much an after-thought and the odd triangle of the main characters is the fulcrum when it shouldn't even be in the foreground. I know that Ellroy is a very dense and hard to follow writer (I know because after LA CONFIDENTIAL came out I actually attempted to read his novel and realized the film nixed several going-no-where plot points for the service of time restraint) but the more and more ridiculous the scenes become are do to the fact the cast is not up to the task at hand. Hartnett is always a puzzling piece of plastic and his Bucky is the narrator to boot (not a strong point with his monotonous monotone trying to ape the affectation of the pot-boilers of the '30s and '40s); Johansson is miscast as a Lana Turner blonde who looks unbelievable like a girl trying to dress up as an adult; Eckhart is wasted (literally) for his talents and Swank's kitschy-koo turn is a dismaying bore but she does have a sexy presence that heretofore was never depicted on screen. Kirshener is the only one - in audition film reel flashbacks - who acquits herself as the slaughtered lamb/conscience with an air of utter sadness and believability of a victim to her own dreams.De Palma has not had a decent mainstream hit since the first ""MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE"" film over a decade ago and his trademark serpentine camera moves are all but practically defanged here (there is a swooping crane shot at the discovery of the Short corpse and a dilly of an attempted strangling ending in the offing of one of the film's protagonists which is ballsy but altogether in the long run comes across as an off-shoulder shrugging). The pacing is lugubriously labored, the main storyline is truncated and the 'love triangle' is boring! There's no chemistry between any of the characters (sexually or simply just being in a regular sequence together) and the last act is a howler invoking a truly over-the-top banshee screeching turn by Shaw as the alcoholic mother of Swank's character that has no business being in the film overall.Ellroy - whose own mother was murdered when he was a young child and her crime never resolved - has said in interviews he was skeptical at first with the adaptation but embraced what eventually was produced; it is hard to fathom since this is truly one of the worst films of the year.",The Black Dahlia

31,evanston_dad,"Not As Bad As I Was Led to Believe, But No Grand Slam for DePalma",5,5 March 2007,"I didn't dislike this modern-day noir as much as many seemed to, but it's certainly no resounding success.Director Brian DePalma directs this big-screen version of the James Ellroy crime novel, itself a fictionalized account of the gruesome murder of Elizabeth Short, an aspiring actress who sadly found more fame in death than she would probably ever have had in life. The film focuses on two L.A. prizefighters turned detectives, played by the squinty-eyed Josh Hartnett and the chisel-jawed Aaron Eckhart, who find themselves wrapped up in an increasingly complex web of deception and murder. Eckhart becomes unnaturally obsessed with the investigation and slowly unravels, much to the dismay of Hartnett and Eckhart's girlfriend, the giant-bosomed Scarlett Johannson. As Eckhart becomes less reliable, Hartnett finds himself investigating the case on his own, and gets sexually involved with a spoiled society girl and sometime lesbian, played by the horse-toothed Hilary Swank. The plot becomes increasingly incomprehensible until it leads to a tidy finale in which the killer of Short reveals all in one of those ""here's what happened"" summaries that appeared at the end of every episode of ""Murder She Wrote"" but which doesn't manage to make anything all that much clearer.The confusing script didn't bother me all that much. Anyone who's seen a handful of films noir from the 1940s and 50s, films that DePalma is obviously trying to emulate, know that the plots of those rarely made a whole lot of sense. What bothered me was DePalma's inability to give his film a consistent tone. I couldn't tell if I was meant to take this film seriously as a crime thriller, or if I was meant to take it as a parody of film noir. At different times it's both of these. Hartnett, Johannson and Eckhart seem to think they should be taking everything deadly seriously, while Swank hams up a storm as the femme fatale, faking a hoity-toity aristocratic accent while stalking around dressed up as a 1940s version of Elvira. She at least has fun with the film, and I had fun with her, but she seems to be in a completely different movie. And Fiona Shaw, who has a small but crucial role as Swank's nutso mother, delivers a dreadful, ghastly performance that sends the film reeling into pure camp.Actually, if the film had stayed in the realm of camp, it would have been much better. Hartnett meets Swank in a lesbian night club where K.D. Lang croons a jazzy number to the accompaniment of a troop of glittery chorus girls. A scene in which Swank invites Hartnett to have dinner with her family is a jaw-dropper of bizarre black humor. A couple of set pieces, like the elaborate craning shot that begins with a shootout and sails over a rooftop to reveal Short's body being discovered in a field, or another action sequence that ends with two men plummeting to their deaths into a courtyard fountain, bring some welcome flashy stylistics to the film and interrupt its silly earnestness, but there's not enough of that. Hartnett is a blank spot at the center of the film, Eckhart is wasted, and Johannson can't do a thing with her poorly written character. Not only does the plot make no sense, but neither do the characters or their motivations. Actors just come and go seemingly at random, Hartnett sleeps with Swank, finds out she had sex with a woman once and freaks out (though I'm not sure why), sleeps with Johannson, goes back to sleeping with Swank, all arbitrarily it would seem. There's an earthquake that doesn't have anything to do with anything else, and the first half hour of the film is devoted to the burgeoning friendship and boxing careers of Hartnett and Eckhart, 30 minutes I thought would become significant later on but never did.But despite all of this, I have to admit that DePalma did keep me watching, and I found myself able to enjoy the movie even while ticking off a long grocery list of its flaws.Grade: B-",The Black Dahlia
32,ferguson-6,Enough Sub-Plots for a TV series,5,16 September 2006,"Greetings again from the darkness. Director Brian DePalma continues to be a legend in his own mind. Although there are some effective individual scenes and performances, the scattershot and sometimes ludicrous script is at times a maze with no end. As with most DePalma films, there are at least a half dozen masterful shots that almost make it worthwhile.This is the film version of James Ellroy's (the FAR superior ""L.A. Confidential"") fictionalized novel based on the 1947 grisly murder of actress wanna-be Elizabeth Short (a very effective Mia Kirshner). Attempting to be a pulp detective thriller in the vein of Raymond Chandler it falls short mostly due to the script (get it? it's a lousy script) but also due to poor casting of the lead. Josh Hartnett is a pleasure for women to look at, but is so much more effective in limited exposure (see ""Sin City""). His expressionless face and vapid looks just don't work in a role that requires the depth of this one. Aaron Eckhart (so great in this year's ""Thank You For Smoking"") is given a promising part that turns to pure crap ... and I am not even sure how it happened. Eckhart really has the look of a 1940's detective, but Hartnett mostly looks like a male model playing dress up.The usually excellent Scarlett Johansson remain fine to look at, but just doesn't pull off the odd character of Kay Lake (a tip of the cap to Veronica). By far the character with the most potential and interest is Hilary Swank, who for some reason is cast as an Elizabeth Short look-alike, even though the only resemblance is dark hair. Of course, a weak script always misses opportunity and this one teases us with Swank's character but never delivers. Rose McGowan has an interesting 4 minute scene and it is cool to see DePalma favorite William Finley in a key (but brief) role.The best parts of the film are the endless stream of beautiful 1940's cars, trucks and motorcycles, the costumes, the background trumpet music, the re-enactment of Elizabeth Short's screen test (replete with DePalma voice over) and one of the oddest families this side of the Royal Tennenbaums (Swank's mom, dad and sis).There are just too many plots happening at once (and I live for multiple plot lines!). None are fully developed, most make little sense and some are just downright laughable. I had the feeling I was watching a remake, but of course, no studio would green light a remake of something this messed up.",The Black Dahlia

Josh Hartnett and Aaron Eckhart play two cops investigating the murder of an actress yet things are far worse than they are. To gain its 1947 setting Brian De Palma uses tainted colour giving a noir appeal resulting in a film that comes as a cross between two other superb De Palma films, Dressed to Kill and The Untouchables. Hartnett narrates the story and becomes entangled with the crime as well as two women, however his solution may be questionable. Eckhart becomes obsessed with the case and detaching from his girlfriend. He is abusive towards her without knowing that his partner is pining after her. She is played by Scarlett Johansson who harbors feelings for Hartnett but endures the stress of her current relationship. Hilary Swank portrays a conniving female who looks like the murder victim. She will factor in with her family thus dragging Hartnett into further criminal decisions. Mia Kirshner plays the title subject under investigation because she is the deceased victim. Rich in its noir presentation with elements of early Hollywood and its dark side. De Palma once again delivers a thriller and his trademark combination of sex and murder.

Bucky soon realises that his current girlfriend had ties to the deceased, and soon after that, he begins uncovering corruption and conspiracy within the police department........Every director has a bad film in their repertoire, that one mistake that ever so slightly tarnishes an illustrious career. Spielberg has 1941, Scorcese has Gangs Of New York, and Michael Bay has his CV.This is De Palmas misstep. But what a misstep it is. Usually with his movies, you have the wonderful cinematography that adds that depth that is synonymous with his movies, and it's here in all its glory, but it's overused, as if he's trying to cover the fact that the whole film is an incoherent mess.So we have two hours and one minute of Josh Hartnett walking around, looking confused, and being either mocked, threatened, punched, made to look a fool, and discovering so etching just as it's too late. And he looks as confused as the audience. The story of The Black Dahlia is a fascinating insight to Hollywoods seedier side, but it's dealt here with a fist fully loaded with ham, and alongside Hartnett, the cast are simply putting in over camp pantomime performances.Johanssen, when she's not looking at Hartnett from the top of the stairs, is just mind numbing as a wannabe Femme Fatale, woefully miscast in her role.Swank makes an extended cameo and spends the majority of it in bed, but she has a secret that is pivotal to the narrative AKA she helps to end it.Eckhart phones in his performance, mugging aimlessly throughout, and just adding to the whole mess.It's nothing more than a best of De Palma cinematography compilation, featuring a miscast, usually better people, a pantomime villain, and it will leave you with a headache and a tinge of anger, because you know the director is so much better than this.",The Black Dahlia
35,gradyharp,'The Black Dahlia': A Misnomer of a Title,4,29 December 2006,"Brian de Palma made an odd decision in creating this apparently very expensive, very strange and confusing version of a film, a movie less about the grisly/twisted unsolved murder (grossly illustrated ad infinitum here) of a wannabe 1940s actress of the title and more about two boxer cops (bland Josh Hartnett as 'Mr. Ice' and over the top Aaron Eckhart as 'Mr. Fire') and their bizarre ménage a trois with unfocused Scarlett Johansson. The film as written by Josh Friedman attempts to follow the novel by James Ellroy, itself a strange riff on the Black Dahlia murder. What results is an over produced, over directed, under realized recreation of the 1940s complete with slicky costumes and very loud music by (surprisingly!) Mark Isham.There are so many subplots filled with walk on characters that keeping the story understandable is almost impossible - certainly not worth an attempt to capsulize for a review. There are some terrific little performances by Fiona Shaw as the druggie mad woman whose role becomes significant only at film's end, Hilary Swank as the copycat Dahlia who dallies in cops and soldiers and lesbians (convincingly so), and Mia Kirshner who presence as the true Black Dahlia is shown only in black and white film clips that indeed focus the unwieldy script while she is on! Odd to see actors with the credentials of this cast wandering around in la-la land seemingly looking for a script that makes sense. But it is a pretty period piece to look at despite the lack of reasonable storyline. Grady Harp",The Black Dahlia
36,The_Void,Extremely disappointing screen version of a great book.,5,27 January 2008,"James Ellroy's novel 'The Black Dahlia' is my favourite book of all time, and for that reason I put off seeing this film for a long time after it was released. It would have been difficult for any film to live to the brilliance of the book; and after hearing of this film's critical drubbing, I knew that this wasn't the one to do it. When reading a book, one will always generate mental pictures of the major players in the story, and that is this film's first major problem. The casting is not good at all. Josh Hartnett is actually better than I thought he would be, but his look and demeanour doesn't fit the central role and any leading role really needs an actor with more ability. Aaron Eckhart is more of a fit as Hartnett's partner and represents one of the better casting decisions, while Scarlett Johansson looks but doesn't feel right as the female side of the central love triangle. Hilary Swank is a great actress, and like Hartnett was better than I thought she would be; but she isn't able to get the ambiguous sexuality of her character across and that's a big shame as that was one of the things that made the book really interesting. Mia Kirshner is the only cast member who really looks and feels right, and it's a good job Josh Friedman's screenplay wasn't faithful to the book with regards to her part in the story.As the title makes obvious, the film is centred around the death of Elizabeth Short, nicknamed 'The Black Dahlia'. The main plot point however is the relationship between cop Dwight Bleichert, his partner Lee Blanchard, and his girlfriend Kay Lake. They form an intricate love triangle which is going well until the disfigured corpse of Elizabeth Short turns up, forcing both men to obsession and destroying their relationship with each other and with Kay. In order to be faithful to the book, this film really needed to be much longer. The film takes the book's key scenes but misses so much out that a lot of it ends up making no sense. The book really worked because of its attention to detail; and since this film misses out many important plot details, the same can't be said for it. Like the earlier L.A. Confidential (also based on a fantastic novel by James Ellroy), the film is very aesthetically pleasing. Brian De Palma was a perfect choice for the film in those terms, although he tends to prove that he's more suited to ripping off Hitchcock than filming anything with depth. This is again proved here, as a film that needs depth to work has none. As a thriller in its own right, The Black Dahlia is still disappointing. I can't really imagine what watching this without having read the book must be like; but I would guess that it's a not a good experience as at least I was able to fill in the holes between the disjointed plot. Overall, this film looks nice and packs enough of the storyline in to ensure that it never actually becomes boring; but as an attempt to bring a brilliant novel to life, The Black Dahlia is frankly pathetic.",The Black Dahlia
37,zetes,"Maybe worth renting; definitely a weak film with some terrible moments. Some good ones, too, though.",6,18 September 2006,"Like all the De Palma films I've seen at least, The Black Dahlia is all style and flash and no substance. Hey, that's cool when the results are fun to watch, as in Sisters, Carlito's Way or Femme Fatale. It doesn't work here, though. It's a busy, hard-boiled police investigation flick that doesn't make a whole lot of sense in the end. De Palma, as you might imagine, goes way over the top in a lot of places, but it just turns out to be embarrassing. There was a lot of inappropriate laughter in the theater. The performances are modeled after old Hollywood, and it just feels like everyone's playing dress-up. The film doesn't offer much to its performers. I was slightly impressed with Hilary Swank, just because her two most famous roles have molded her image into that of a tomboy or butch lesbian. She actually has some lesbiana to deal with here, as well, but she gets to be a femme (of the fatale variety). I've never thought of her as attractive, but she out-sexes Scarlett Johansson in this one. The only truly good performance in the film belongs to Mia Kirshner as Elizabeth Short, the murder victim. You may remember Kirshner as a teenage stripper in Atom Egoyan's Exotica. I didn't know she was still around, but she's very good here, seen only in screen test footage. The characters are all two dimensional, and the screenplay is generally poor. I grew bored fairly quickly. All in all, as disappointing as it may be, it would probably be worth seeing The Black Dahlia. De Palma's camera is as impressive as always. Maybe rent it.",The Black Dahlia
38,Sylviastel,Good acting in otherwise flawed film!,7,17 September 2006,"Don't get me wrong, I have read a lot about the true crime of the black dahlia murder of Elizabeth ""Betty"" Short. I haven't read James Ellroy's novel centered around the Black Dahlia. Of course, the crime is never solved and remains as infamous as Jack the Ripper in American folklore. There are plenty of suspects and of course, Los Angeles police department was corrupted by the wealth and power of Hollywood moguls. This was not a place for those young aspiring girls like Betty Short to become a movie star but to end in tragedy. Her murder was brutal even compared to this day. The details can make anybody queazy if you don't know or are unaware of them. Anyway, the cast is excellent especially Aaron Eckhart who was in Thank You for Smoking, he turns in a great performance but is overshadowed by his younger on screen professional male partner Josh Harnett. Aaron plays Lee Blanchard, an LAPD cop and boxer, who is married to Scarlet JOhanson's character Kay. She does a pretty good job of making you forget. I didn't care for the lesbian bar scenes because I think there unrealistic and man's fantasy. Let's not forget it's Brian DePalma directing this film. KD Lang has a brief moment as a lesbian bar singer in a pretty risqué sketch. Hilary Swank plays Madeline Limpscott, a woman who looks like the Black DAhlia. She comes from a wealthy prominent family. Her father practically build Hollywood but her family is quite unsavory. Fiona Shaw makes a surprising performance out of such a small role. I know she has an honorary CBE but she's got Irish dame all over her. Madeline's sister, Martha, is played by Macauley Culkin's former wife, Rachel Miner. Funny, I watched her grow up on Guiding Light. Like L.A. Confidential, there are lot of simlarities with the characters and the plots. I wanted Harnett's character Dwight, to ask Madeline why she goes to lesbian haunts when she appears to be straight. Was it just to show a scene in a lesbian nightclub? There are few more scenes that really risqué involving Elizabeth Short and a blonde teen unknown actress as well. The director seemed to have enjoyed in bringing a lot of lesbian scenes in this movie even if it was unnecessary or had nothing to do with the plot. if you're going to show a lesbian bar of the 1940s, be a little more realistic rather than idealistic to satisfy men's fantasies. I mean weren't the lesbian patrons shocked to see a man in the bar even a policeman without uniform. Now, I know I go on about this issue but since I have read a lot about the black dahlia case, I don't understand why it was overly done in the first place.",The Black Dahlia
39,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Black Dahlia,7,15 October 2006,"There are a couple of reasons why I wanted to watch The Black Dahlia. First, the trailer was slick, and the strangely hypnotic song used in the trailer, Dirge - by Death in Vegas, actually had this enthralling sublime message which to me was ""watch this"". Next, it's a police noir set in the 40s Hollywood. Movies set during that era and at that location appeal to me too, as will Hollywoodland. And last but not least, it stars Scarlett Johansson, sexiest woman alive if Esquire Magazine is to be believed (and I actually agree).However, The Black Dahlia, opening movie for this year's 63rd Venice Film Festival, was anything like what the trailer suggested in terms of the story. While the trailer made it look like a major investigative piece into the horrific murder of an actress, and the cops being made to run circles to get the culprit, that portion of the movie, though integral to the whole scheme of things and is the core, actually becomes secondary, and the whole movie was moving in and around everything else, until put right towards the end.There are many subplots shooting from everywhere involving families, real estates, hoodlums, lust, greed, corruption, and even boxing (!) which steal your attention away from the crux, and with the hydra of unsolved mysteries just building up with no end in sight, it just becomes increasing frustrating as the movie progresses with all these unanswered questions and disparate scenes, until they all come together toward the end. It really calls for one's patience and undivided attention to watch this.But is it all worthwhile? Yes, but the ride's excruciatingly painful, with the payout probably just barely adequate for some. The sets and costumes were wonderful, and being set in post WWII Los Angeles, The Black Dahlia is loosely based on James Ellroy's book, which is turn is based on the true story of the murder of an aspiring actress called Elizabeth Short. Two detectives partners, Leland Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) and Dwight Bleichert (Josh Harnett), nicknamed Fire and Ice (in an incredibly long introductory scene involving boxing) find themselves involved in a murder case involving a mutilated body of a woman. While Blanchard becomes obsessed with solving the murder, Bleichert finds himself drawn towards a mystery woman encountered during investigations, a certain Madeleine Linscott (Academy Award winner Hilary Swank), and also towards Blanchard's girl Kay Lake, played by Scarlett Johansson.I'm not about to explain or touch on the dozen or so sub plots and characters involved in the story. However, Johansson's screen time is severely limited, so fans will probably have to get their fix in the other movies showing in town, with the modern day Scoop, or the upcoming The Prestige set in Victorian England. The 40s Hollywood setting here allows opportunity for Johansson to be illuminated on screen in soft focus, and she does look like a star from the yesteryears, with that hairdo adopted.I last seen Aaron Eckhart in Thank You for Smoking, and I thought it was a decent role he took on here as the slowing-degenerating-into-unpredictability cop of a partner to have. Clearly the lead belonged to Josh Harnett, whom I thought did a voice-over in Sin City as well as Lucky Number Sle7in. I won't be surprised if he corners that voice over / dubbing role, as his voice does give that soothing quality to make you sit up and listen to what he has to say.It's quite understandable that this movie will warrant some low ratings, given its at times shoddy delivery leaving much wanting. I actually thought director Brian De Palma could do better, given that he's helmed classics like The Untouchables, Scarface and Mission: Impossible (which I liked), though there are the duds like Femme Fatale and The Bonfire of the Vanities which he conjured as well. There was one scene though which I thought was fairly neat, like his one-continuous camera-motion in Snake Eyes, replicated here with a sequence involving an introductory house visit.While The Black Dahlia is faulted for Brian De Palma's delivery, it tells a compelling enough story, with unflinching violence and uncut sexual situations involving lesbianism and suggested incest, in an unedited M18 rating. Just remember to be patient for the payoff at the end, and lookout for KD Lang!",The Black Dahlia
40,christopher-underwood,most confusing movie,6,9 January 2008,"Beautifully shot but most confusing movie. I am not familiar with the Ellroy source novel but suspect that herein lies the answer to the problem De Palma fails to overcome. I suspect that the original book has a most seedy background and indeed although the movie alludes to underage sex, the stress is upon lesbianism as the great 'sin'. It seems that someone just couldn't deal with the whole dirty business of men buying young girls for sex, but this switch to lesbianism and the consequent stress on how appalling sex between two girls is, whilst showing us pretty crap examples, has to be the film's undoing because the two things are so very different. The poorly developed characters of all the leads except that of Hilary Swank, doesn't help and the waste of Scarlett Johansson is shameful.",The Black Dahlia
41,siderite,"Hell, I liked it! Sue me!",8,1 January 2007,"Having read so many negative reviews, I started doubting my own rating for a minute, but no, I will rate this above average. It may not much for people knowing what the Black Dahlia murders were all about or that read the book, but for a movie, it was good.The film has the feel of L.A. Confidential (but it's not that good) or maybe more like Where the Truth Lies and is beautifully shot. The story itself is somehow convoluted, but it all becomes somewhat clearer in the end. Yes, the plot does have some holes in it and some acting is not so convincing as it should be, but saying Josh Hartnett didn't act is just lame. He plays a less emotional person than others and he was very well cast for the role. Some of the script scenes were weak, that's one thing an actor can't change.Bottom line: watch it in a slow night, when you feel like seeing a movie that removes you from everyday life. This is not exactly a noir film, but it's close enough.",The Black Dahlia
42,JamesHitchcock,A Fattened Goose Stuffed with Goose-Liver Pate,4,25 May 2013,"Elizabeth Short (1924-1947) was the victim of a particularly gruesome unsolved murder which took place in Los Angeles in January 1947. After the discovery of her mutilated body, she was nicknamed ""The Black Dahlia"" by the press, inspired partly by the recently released movie ""The Blue Dahlia"" and partly by her fondness for black clothing. Some accounts have described Short as an ""aspiring actress"" or even as a ""Hollywood starlet"", terminology which has given the misleading impression that she was an up-and-coming new talent only one lucky break away from fully-fledged stardom, perhaps the next Rita Hayworth or Ava Gardner. The reality is more prosaic. Short may have had acting ambitions but never did much about realising them; there is no record of her ever having appeared in a single film, even as an extra. This film tells a story very loosely based upon the ""black dahlia"" killing, centred upon the two (fictitious) police officers investigating the crime. It does not (unlike, say, David Fincher's ""Zodiac"" from the following year, also dealing with an unsolved California murder case) provide a possible solution to the mystery; its denouement is pure fiction rather than speculation. Fincher, in fact, was originally scheduled to direct the film, before the job was given to Brian De Palma. The two policemen involved, Dwight 'Bucky' Bleichert and Lee Blanchard, both former boxers, are initially close friends, but their friendship is placed under strain by the growing mutual attraction between Bucky and Lee's girlfriend Kay. I won't set out the plot in any detail, as it is a particularly complex one, but it involves such elements as the pornographic film industry, a lesbian nightclub, a young woman named Madeleine Linscott whom Bucky meets in the club in the course of his investigations and with whom he becomes sexually involved, Madeleine's wealthy family who made their fortune in the 1920s property boom, a former drug dealer whom Lee once sent to jail and some startling revelations about most of the main characters. The actual facts of the ""black dahlia"" case are often ignored; there is, for example, no evidence that the real Elizabeth Short was a lesbian or that she acted in pornographic movies, which is how she is portrayed here. (I wonder if James Ellroy, who wrote the novel on which the film is based, was simply cashing in on the notoriety of the case. Had he given his book some other title and called the victim, say, ""Jane Smith"" or ""Mary Brown"" I doubt if it would have attracted as much interest). The acting is variable in quality. I had previously only seen the two male leads, Josh Hartnett as Bucky and Aaron Eckhart as Lee in one film each, and neither had impressed me. Eckhart is certainly better here than he was in that insipid and formulaic comedy ""No Reservations"", but Hartnett is just as dull as he was in that prize turkey ""Pearl Harbor"". This matters, because Bucky is that typical noir figure, the flawed hero trying to survive in a corrupt, violent world with his honour and integrity intact. This sort of role, which in the classic noir era would have been played by someone like Humphrey Bogart or Glenn Ford, is one which normally demands considerable acting skills and charisma, and Hartnett seems lacking in both departments. Of the female leads Hilary Swank as Madeleine makes an effective femme fatale (another stock noir character) and there is a good cameo from Mia Kirshner as Elizabeth (seen in flashbacks) but Scarlett Johansson is unmemorable. Johansson can be a wonderful actress (as she was in ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" and ""The Other Boleyn Girl""), but she can also be an inconsistent one and seems to make more poor films than good ones. Like many neo-noirs, such as ""Chinatown"", ""Body Heat"", ""Gorky Park"" and ""Insomnia"", ""The Black Dahlia"" has its own distinctive visual style, but few if any modern directors have got as close as De Palma to the look of the original films noirs. He did not quite have the courage to make it in black-and-white, but used a sombre, muted palette which is about as close as a colour film can come to monochrome, and made much use of the dramatic chiaroscuro lighting effects favoured by the original noir directors. As with original noir, many scenes take place at night or in dimly-lit rooms. The film received a ""Best Cinematography"" Oscar nomination, but lost to ""Pan's Labyrinth"".The cinematography is certainly effective, but unfortunately the same cannot be said of most other aspects of this movie. A complex plot is a frequent characteristic of noir and neo-noir, but in this case there are too many details for them all to be properly developed and as a result the plot does not make a lot of sense. The scriptwriter seems to have taken a magpie approach to his job, borrowing elements from other crime films such as ""Chinatown"" (the creepy, quasi-incestuous relationship between Madeleine and her father), ""Get Carter"" (the porn industry), the ""Batman"" series (one character has a ""Glasgow smile"" akin to the Joker's carved into his face) and even, at the end, ""The Birds"". The ""New Yorker"" described the film as ""a kind of fattened goose that's been stuffed with goose-liver pâté, over-rich and fundamentally unsatisfying"", and the comparison is a just one. Those like me who were hoping for something as good as ""L A Confidential"", another neo-noir with a period setting based on a James Ellroy novel, are likely to be disappointed. 4/10",The Black Dahlia

This started off strangely as a boxing movie, then a police movie, then a murder mystery, then a love story, then... well, you get the idea.

44,blanbrn,Well done take and look at the classic Hollywood murder mystery shown in a classy film noir way.,8,1 October 2007,"""The Black Dahlia"" is well done it puts some closure and educated many about the most famous unsolved murder mystery in Hollywood that of young actress Elizabeth Short. Though the film spends much of it's time focusing on subplots with other characters as the viewer finds out mostly about the other characters lives, and it took a good look into the 1940's culture of Los Angeles especially the corruption and greed and scandals of the police and the influence of Hollywood and the mob. In 1940's two cops Dwight Bieichert(Josh Hartnett) and Lee Blanchard(Aaron Eckhart) are two young bright detectives who live good lives especially Lee with his classy and sexy Hollywood style girlfriend Kay(Scarlett Johansson). Yet the world of both becomes unraveled when the body of a female is discovered and mutilated to the point that she's not identified. The case takes both on a journey of corruption, scandal, lies, and betrayal with dark secrets being revealed. Most interesting is when Dwight meets a sexy rich lady named Madeleine(Hilary Swank) who has dark ties and a connection to the victim in question. Overall one of the better films of 2006 I was glad it was made so Hollywood could put solved closure on the famous unsolved murder of Elizabeth Short plus it was filmed in the classy film noir way of the 40's and the acting was top notch from all.",The Black Dahlia
45,Buddy-51,no fragrant flower,4,1 October 2006,"Brian De Palma's ""The Black Dahlia"" is like a beautiful sports car with no engine under the hood: it sits there looking mighty pretty, but it never actually goes anywhere.The movie is based on the James Ellroy novel of the same name, a highly fictionalized telling of Hollywood's most notorious unsolved murder case. On January 15, 1947, a young woman named Beth Short was found brutally slain - her body gruesomely dismembered and gutted - in a field in Los Angeles. The case became a cause celebre around the nation, with speculation rife as to the background of the victim and the identity of the perpetrator, but the actual killer was never found. The movie focuses on two fictional homicide detectives, played by Josh Hartnett and Aaron Eckhart, who, to varying degrees, become obsessed with the case. Their investigation leads them into the heart of a film noir maelstrom comprised almost exclusively of twisted psychosexual perverts and Tinsel Town sickos. Thanks to Vilmos Zsigmond's fine cinematography and all the spiffy 1940's paraphernalia with which the costume designer and art directors have decked out the movie, ""The Black Dahlia"" is never anything but dazzling to look at, but in almost every other respect, the film is a monumental disappointment. Although the first half is relatively straightforward in its approach and style, by about the midway point, De Palma's trademark cinematic excesses - stilted dialogue, floridly staged action scenes, campy performances, and overemphatic music - begin to take over and the film becomes an incoherent mess. It becomes virtually impossible to keep all the characters straight without a program, and poor Fiona Shaw - so wonderful in ""Mountains of the Moon"" - is required to overact so outrageously that audiences the world over will be doubled over in laughter at her scenery-chewing histrionics. Her climactic speech - in which she names names and blurts out all the details of the crime, of course - will surely go down in movie history as one of those classic it's-so-bad-it's-good moments that movie lovers everywhere will be mimicking and howling over for years to come. Not that the other actors fare much better. Hartnett gives his all to the role of Bucky Bleichert but, as an actor, he lacks the gravitas necessary to make the character interesting. Eckhart is forced to thrash around inside a character whose motivations are never convincingly spelled out for either the actor or the audience, and Scarlet Johansson and Hilary Swank seem to be doing parodies of crime thriller vixens rather than serious interpretations of believable, three-dimensional characters.It pains me to have to say this, but no one comes out smelling like a rose with this ""Dahlia.""",The Black Dahlia

The manner of Elizabeth's death is so sickening and sadistic with her body was cut in two with a mockingly weird smile cut across her mouth and face makes the case of who or even what, it's hard to believe that any human could do anything like this, her killer is a nation wide media event in 1947. This before the up to the minute and all day and night cable TV news coverage that we have today.Put on the high profile case is the golden boys of the LAPD ex-boxing buddies and partners officer Dwight ""Bucky"" Bleichert and Sgt. Leland ""Lee"" Blachard, Josh Hartnett & Aaron Eckhart, the B&B boys known to everyone on the force as Fire & Ice. It's also a fact that the two cop were involved in a shootout just minutes before the woman's body was found with a number of pimps and one of the the pimps customers Baxter Fitch, John Solari, ending up shot and killed by Sgt. Blanchard with a bullet in his chest. Fitch's death will prove to be much more then a routine shooting in self-defense by Sgt. Blanchard, which is what his partner officer Bucky Bleichert at first thought. Fitch was cold-blooded murdered and was the reason why Blanchard later ends up getting strung out on Benzedrine and even dead.We have here the two cops being involved with this utterly gorgeous Lana Turner look-alike Kay Lake, Scarlett Johansson, who from what we soon learn about her had been involved with this vicious hoodlum who trafficked in both the drug and white slavery rackets named Bobby DeWitt, Richard Blake. Bobby keeps Kay in line by having branded her on her back with a switchblade knife with the letter BD, DeWitt it's learned by Kay is to be released from jail any day now. The movie ""The Black Dahlia"" just bites into much more then it can chew by having at least three different sub-plots in it besides the unfortunate death murder and mutilation of Elizabeth Short and that's what makes it so hard to follow. There's the fact that both Sgt. Blanchard and his girl Kay were involved with DeWitt in a bank robbery back in 1939 where, were told later in the movie, he doubled-crossed DeWitt by turning him in. In fact it was Blanchard who arrested Dewitt with his girlfriend Kay taking off with the stolen cash.We also get involved with the Scotsman and mega builder,the then Donald Trump of L.A, Emmet Linscott (John Kavanagh) and his dysfunctional family that includes his sultry Elizabeth Short look-alike daughter Madeline, Hilary Swank, and completely whacked out wife Romona, Fiona Shaw, and his other not all there upstairs daughter Martha, Rachel Miner. It turns out that Becky while investigating Emmet gets romantically involved with Madeline who he later finds out****SPOILERS***** was also having an affair with his partner Sgt.Blanchard who in turn was blackmailing old man Linscott over his involvement in the porno industry!Lumbering along to it's very convoluted and unrealistic conclusion, unlike in real life, the murder of Elizabeth Short is solved by the time the film is over. Blanchard is murdered by being pushed off a balcony by his former partner in crime Bobby DeWitt who's shot and killed by someone out of camera range while he was being interrogated by Bucky. Bucky now on his own and obsessed with solving not only the Black Dahlia murder case but the murder of his partner Blanchard ends up being in bed with both Blanchard's girl Kay as well as Madeline in order to settle his nerves down, Bucky holds himself responsible for Blanchard's death, as well as relive the tension that built up inside of him during the movie. Way To Go Bucky!We finally get the story of who's responsible for Elizabeth Short's murder but it takes at least some 20 minutes of explaining,in real time and flashback, to who was behind it and we get this insane scenario of madness and murder that involves almost all the members, including Bucky's bedmate Madeline, of the crazy Linscott clan including their psycho gardener, and former partner in the Linscott building empire, George ""Georgie"" Tilden, William Finley.The movie completely falls apart at the end when Bucky confronts the Linscotts at their mansion and in what has to be some of the most outrageous scenes in film-noir history has them each giving a different version or account of what really happened to Elizabeth. This mind-boggling spectacle finally ends with****MAJOR SPOILERS*** the off-the-wall matriarch of the family Mrs. Romona Linscott blowing her brains out.In the end of the movie Bucky goes back to Key, who left him when she found him smooching with Madeline, and his life as a L.A policeman.

47,Robert_duder,Some of the best and not so best film making of the year...complex...,7,21 September 2006,"So far the Oscar picks are slim for the ones I thought would sweep and The Black Dahlia I thought for sure would be one of those films but after seeing it I'm not so sure. It's not that The Black Dahlia is not good...in fact in many ways it's brilliant. First and foremost the cinematography and direction is downright brilliant. If there was ever a film that absolutely captures the 40's film noir, detective film this is it!! 2006 will be remembered for this film as capturing the heart of not only 40's Hollywood but the style of film. The soft ambiance of the female leads, the tough and brash performance by the male leads and the quiet, mellow narration by the lead detective. Parts of this film are brilliant!! The cast is very good while I will delve into in a moment but where this film trips and stumbles...actually falls flat is the story. Based on a novel which I have not read it is fair to warn anyone that this film barely touches the actual Black Dahlia murder. Based on a very real historical, still open case the film doesn't touch on it accurately in ANY way. This is a completely fictional story revolving around a historical event and how that event effects the lives of two detectives...one in particular. While brilliant in it's atmosphere the story drags and you keep questioning how the murder has anything to do with what's going on. But on the plus side it does present a solution to the murder (although completely fictional.) Josh Hartnett really grows up in this picture. I think this might be his big breakthrough role into adult acting. I know he's had some decently mature roles but I never took him seriously until now. His performance as ""Bucky"" Bleichert is good enough to carry the film which is tough considering the slow moving and sticky plot. He's tough and masculine and his voice over work for the narration really makes a difference in the film. I feel he deserves at least a nomination for this role since he really does make the film worth while and I've never been a huge fan. Aaron Eckhart, who has always been a terrific character actor really shines as the Black Dahlia obsessed Detective ""Lee"" Blanchard, Bleichert's partner and best friend. Eckhart really is intense and his character arc goes from in control and strong to a complete mess as he delves into the murder which drives him to solve it because of his sister whose murder went unsolved years before that. Eckhart really does get a much more emotionally driven character than Hartnett and ends up turning out a more noticeable role and will likely get a supporting actor nod. The ladies of The Black Dahlia are probably the most noticeable. Scarlett Johansson scorches the screen as Eckhart's long time girlfriend Kay Lake. It's not so much that her performance is sexy or sexualized but her performance is that of Audrey Hepburn, she embraces the forties and comes across as an actress from the high light of Hollywood. She looks stunning and her pale visage, blonde hair and bright red lipstick make her luminous. The soft way that De Palma films her utilizes her best and she absolutely deserves accolades for this role. On the flip side you have Hilary Swank who has had some great roles, and an Academy Award to her name but falters with this role slightly. She doesn't come across anywhere nearly as glamorous as Johansson but then her character isn't meant to. She plays sultry, seductive, and almost slutty Madeleine Linscott. Despite being rich she comes across as low class and sleazy. She seduces Hartnett's character and becomes embroiled in the murder mystery. Still her accent and her performance comes across a little forced and not nearly as well fitted as everyone else in the film is. Johansson definitely outshines her although they have little to no screen time together. Mia Kirshner plays a small yet important role as the ill fated Black Dahlia Elizabeth Short in video footage and flashbacks. Her character is mysterious and intriguing and her background unfolds carefully as they investigate. She does a great job performing the role she is given. Fiona Shaw plays the mentally deranged mother of Hilary Swank's character. She comes across as more of a joke than a serious role but it is some comic relief however misplaced that may be.Brian De Palma has a name in Hollywood. He has made some twisted, violent and dark movies and in many ways The Black Dahlia fits his M.O. perfectly. The film has De Palma all over it and his brilliant direction has to be given great kudos. His brilliant capturing of 40's Hollywood is an absolute must see. Unfortunately the story that should focus on the murder takes twists and turns through Bleichert and Blanchard's relationship, friendship and ultimate downfall...the film covers everything from their boxing career to their rise within the police force. The violent and dark and gritty nature of the murder is kept in tact and done in true De Palma style there is no doubt. There are definitely moments of cringe worthy violence and this is a great piece of art. The film is complex and intelligent, maybe too much so but for a true lover of film must be seen if not simply for the great performances and truly brilliant film making. 7/10",The Black Dahlia
48,Lejink,Withered and died...,5,22 April 2010,"I am a De Palma fan and readily concede he can ""do"" period Americana but got lost somewhat in this stylish, stylised thriller which only gives a glancing nod to the actually much more interesting unresolved murder of the real-life ""Black Dahlia"" actress in post war Hollywood. Here, said brutal murder is only a jumping-off point for a very contrived plot, which sees boxing rivals-cum-police partners Hartnett & Eckhart not only get fixated on blonde ex-call girl Scarlett Johannsen, but also on Black Dahlia lookalike Hilary Swank and her majorly dysfunctional family.I'm attributing the conflated story-line to the writing source, James Ellroy and yet it was Ellroy who penned the best mid-century crime thriller, the brilliant ""LA Confidential"", so maybe I'm letting the director off too lightly.No, what we get here is a real mish-mash, with a story that goes off on too many tangents, peopled by paper-thin characters with little more substance to them than the pages of a pulp magazine. The acting can't redeem it either, none of the leads showing any real passion or emotion in their work, while the less said about the histrionic acting by the mad matriarch or the cod-Scottish accent of the domineering patriarch.I did like the cinematography and De Palma's trademark ""big death"", as ever like something from Grand Opera, shown in slow-motion from every conceivable angle as per, also the set dressing and the omnipresent jazz soundtrack, but Hartnett and Eckhart fall a long way short of, say Costner & Connery and with De Palma pretty much treating his actors like Hitchcockian cattle, the viewer just gets breathlessly shifted from scene to scene, with often no exposition or depth to attract interest.On the whole then, a stylish failure, but still with enough of De Palma's trademark tricks and treats to just about engage his fans. Beyond that though, the movie just doesn't cut it as a would-be modern noir.",The Black Dahlia
49,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Quite recommendable period piece thriller,9,4 March 2007,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning A new adaptation of a James Ellroy novel, The Black Dahlia is the story of the titular Hollywood diva Elizabeth Short, who is found brutally murdered on wasteland, plunging the city's police department into disarray and remaining the city's most high profile unsolved murder till this day. Sgt. Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) and his protégé Officer Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) lead the investigation- but both are men with unseen ties to the crime, that could bring the whole police department down with them.The last great adaptation of an Ellroy novel, of course, was 1997's unforgettable L.A. Confidential. It goes without saying that TBD doesn't come close to matching that film's standards, but that's not to say it's a film with absolutely no intrinsic value whatsoever.Based around a true story (which interestingly, as I said, remains the biggest unsolved crime in L.A.'s history today), the film brings the atmosphere of the time alive quite well, capturing a good period setting and decent film noir-ish style. Many have complained about Hartnett's performance in one of the lead role's being too bland and wooden. He's not an actor renowned for turning in Oscar worthy performances, but he's certainly not as bad as everyone says he is, not bringing any outstanding depth to his role but carrying it fairly well anyway. A lot of the supporting cast, including Hilary Swank and Scarlett Johansson, show him up a bit, but, there you go. Brian De Palma is also a director who scores as many misses as he does hits, but again he also does fairly well in spite of himself here, gliding things along nicely and building a fairly neat sense of tension and suspense through-out.A downside is that the pace drags a bit towards the end and there are a lot of twists and turns to pay attention to, maybe a bit too many. Or maybe James Ellroy is a bit over me. Nevertheless, this is a good, solid thriller that is well worth seeing. ****",The Black Dahlia
50,dromasca,stylish LA murder drama,7,3 February 2007,"'The Black Dahlia' is not perfect, but is a well built and sophisticated movie. I knew nothing about the real story that inspired it and it was only with the credits that I realized it is based on a true crime story. Yet, the atmosphere of the 1946-47 LA is very well rendered, reminding not only the Oscar saluted 'LA Confidential' but also or especially the great gangster movies of the era. Humphrey Bogart could have been cast in this film.Much of the action is centered around the friendship between the two cops (Josh Hartnett, Aaron Eckhart) and their triangle relation with the beautiful Kay acted by Scarlett Johansson. When one of the cops becomes involved with the horrific murder of an aspiring actress, sordid details of a Hollywood era where gangsters, cops and riches were mixing freely start to surface, involving the characters themselves. Although the story is not always clear during the movie itself things make sense to the end and the details seem to find their place.There is a theatricality in the style that one will love or hate. I loved it. The camera work and colors try to recover the palette of the 40s, and there are a lot of film-in-film parts that Hollywood loves and there is room and sense for them here. I liked less the off-screen comments, they were trying to bring some of the flavor of the gangster novels, but I believe that the movie could have done well without them. Acting was fine, Harnett and Eckhardt partnered well, Hilary Swank was at best at her first film after 'Milion Dollar Baby' while Scarlett Johansson was just OK in a role that asked more of a physical presence than gave her an opportunity for a deep performance.A more than satisfactory movie.",The Black Dahlia

Is it about boxing, a love triangle, a rich chick, a bank robbery? The murder of Elizabeth Short is almost an after thought in this movie. What did all the boxing in the beginning have to do with the movie? Why was some bank robbery mentioned several times? When the other cop is murdered, did that happen in real life or is most of this movie made up?I thought the story was lame and the acting nothing memorable.FINAL VERDICT: A hodge podge of ideas leads to a mess in this movie.

With great style and atmosphere, this retro movie provides a colorful look into the old earlier century cops movies with the flawed hero and the mysterious woman. The convoluted plot unfolds like L.A. Confidential, but somehow the content of the movie stumbles in a way that makes this movie more effort to watch than immersing into the story. The chemistry seems missing, the interest in the characters seem distant even though the story itself should have been sufficient to carry the movie to acclaim. The look and subtext are all wonderful, yet the voice over and the need for the plentiful explanation only points out the weaknesses in the movie. While commendable, the movie was dragged down by its own complexity as the whole mystery seemed to weave in and out of focus at times as the ability on the audience to connect to the victim was diminished by the rest of the story.

The only good thing is the cinematography, which captures the atmosphere of the film noir of the period. The plot is murky and uninvolving and De Palma's direction is over-the-top as usual, making the film look like a spoof except it's quite serious. It seems De Palma told Hartnett and Ekchart to just act angry, which must not have been hard once they realized what they had signed up for.

The self-serious dialogue, interspersed with goofy lines and goofier story turns one can only assume are knowing comic relief, is not only tonally destructible, but also an offensive, unsolved real-life crime. The film's pacing is quite slow and doesn't become interesting more than halfway through. With an unsettling ending, the film doesn't bring in enough intrigue or suspense of sorts.",The Black Dahlia
55,johnnyboyz,The Black hole that is The Black Dahlia marks a further decline in our relationship with De Palma.,4,21 December 2009,"The only praise one could possibly reserve for The Black Dahlia might be on a technical level, particularly in the recreation of 1940s Los Angeles; everything else contained within is either a monumental chore or an agonising bore, as once enjoyable and engaging director Brian De Palma pours further petrol on the fire that is his career after his last couple of projects. Just as the empty-headed; convoluted; incomprehensible; leery dross that-was Femme Fatale looked like the new low-point for De Palma, that now looks like a riveting; exciting and bold piece of work as out rolls The Black Dahlia, the latest in James Ellroy adaptations of gloomy detectives shuffling around the noir infused world of post-war America. In short, it's utter nonsense when it isn't particularly interesting and a painful watch when it attempts to be anywhere near the level of dramatic.Was another noir homage really what the world needed? Soderbergh's 2007 effort The Good German was an interesting piece exploring the relationships and power struggles in a dilapidated and worn out post-war Germany under the umbrella of a real-life power struggle as the world's leaders came together to discuss where everyone went next. Some other recent films; ranging from 2007's Zodiac to Renaissance from 2006, both used the ingredients and elements of noir to deliver their own narratives revolving around arcs and themes of investigation and corruption, respectively. This effort is caught inbetween; wanting to deliver the goods by way of genre but ends up trundling and mumbling down a lane of daft material to do with murdered young women; gruff, angry police officers desperately trying to come off as tough; and phony love triangles between people it's difficult to connect with through their own lack of both originality and character.The film sees LAPD police detective and former boxer Dwight 'Bucky' Bleichert (Hartnett) take on the case of a murdered young and upcoming actress in 1946 Los Angeles; this after he and his buddy, who also did a bit of boxing, Lee Blanchard (Eckhart) nonchalantly waltz into the homicide division after a predetermined slug-fest between the two of them. The displaying of these bodies in all their sweaty, bruised glory followed by a standing ovation as both of them enter the fast-talking, ego driven arena that-is the rows and rows of desks in the homicide division is a distinct applauding of male machismo; a celebration of the sorts of hard boiled cops at the centre of this tale and the likes of which De Palma wants to get across that he admires and adores so much.Following this promotion and around this murder plot which unfolds is a buddy detective combination that turns sour, and isn't it always the way; because this is due to a woman. The woman is Kay Lake (Johansson), Blanchard's girlfriend who becomes a little too involved with Dwight in an instance which might very well drive the guys apart. The real question is why De Palma is even bothering with this material; it's a collection of themes, ideas and conventions that have been previously explored, more efficiently, in other films; some of which you might even claim are the works of De Palma himself, specifically The Untouchables and the stunning Carlito's Way. The film is a technically efficient exercise, but relatively soulless in its overall existence, while the unfortunate murder of a young woman and the underlying detective arc the film tries to explore because of this is rendered a sub-plot of sorts in its own film because of the love triangle going on.So much of the film is so silly, and so daft, and so convoluted that it all just folds in on itself. The Black Dhalia supposedly began life as a TV series, and you can see where they were going with that, since so much is crammed into a two hour film that still feels under-baked. Some of the dumber content sees the character of Dwight, the boxer, use that fact to give him (and the film) an excuse to have him beat people up real good; while the threatening tone he uses towards a waitress at one point falls flat because Hartnett is unable to execute it. If you're looking for Josh Hartnett in a decent role which doubles up as an homage to noir, then check out his work in 2005's Sin City – a supporting role that sees him used correctly.Whatever escapades the characters go on, in terms of jousting with one another; struggling to solve the case and struggling at home with domestic issues, are punctuated by De Palma's dopey references to classical Hollywood movies of around the time the film is set. The cases in point are the fact that the camera encompasses the advertising of Black Angel outside a cinema entrance; the film wants us to know the characters are driving around Hollywoodland on a number of occasions; a mentioning of Rita Hayworth is wormed in there; while towards the end, one such female character stands on the stairs of her creepy place of dwelling and does what appears to be an impression of Gloria Swanson out of 1950's Sunset Blvd, in all of her glorious eccentricity. For some of the time, this renders the experience of watching The Black Dahlia akin to sitting down with De Palma in a room somewhere, and just have him go through his old movie collection. He likes his noir and his classical Hollywood cinema; that's great - most of us do, but can we all please just move on to bigger and better things now?",The Black Dahlia
56,jzappa,The Return of Brian De Palma,9,18 September 2006,"The Black Dahlia is De Palma's return to his status as a stylistically obsessed, visually meticulous director of popcorn thrillers. His thrillers have more often than not been nothing more than exercises, as they borrow from every classic Hitchcock film and only hold together as their own because of De Palma's unique visual traits. The Black Dahlia is not an exercise, but it is not a serious and compelling film either. It doesn't take itself very seriously. It's a comic book, basically.It's being compared to Hollywoodland, which is coming out at pretty much the same time, both movies having a spectacular amount in common. Both films are period pieces about the mysterious deaths of struggling actors in Hollywood. Both have their obsessed detectives and ambiguous females. The comparison is rather difficult, I've found, just having seen them both back to back this weekend. Hollywoodland is a more deadpan and serious take on its real-life case, presenting nothing more than theory and going beyond the murder mystery and developing into more of a character drama. The Black Dahlia takes full dramatic license with its true story in a more outlandish and tangled piece of voyeurism full of sex and violence.The story's exposition is well-drawn, creating an unusual relationship between the two detectives, given lots of verve and charm by Hartnett and Eckhart. The plot, which almost ties itself in a bunch of knots, enthusiastically exercises suspension of disbelief, especially in its surprises.De Palma has not lost his touch, and its cast loads the screen with charm and, in the case of increasingly distressed girlfriend Johanssen, femme fatale Swank, and emotionally eroding victim Kirshner, incredibly hot.",The Black Dahlia
57,subxerogravity,"Brian De Palma has done better, but I do like it as a Brian De Palma film",6,31 July 2016,"While writing this post, I discovered that the Black Dahila is a very fictional tale of an event that really happen. Based on a book that talks about the real case, This movie adaption takes the unsolved mystery and runs with an over glorified possible scenario with a focus on two cops working the case.De Palma mentioned his love of Hicthcock and its cool that I am seeing that love in his movie style, being brought out (or I see it best) in these light but violent out burst that you see when characters fight or get in a gun battle. It's dark in tone, but at the same time stylized not to be.He styles a seen to feel very colorful, but then characters make physical contact and it can through you off a little, as it emphasizes the violence.It Possibly stands out more because it's a period piece taking place in golden age Hollywood (I'm a sucker for those kinds of movies). If the movie was made in 1947 like when it takes place, Universal, the studio that released it, would tell De Palma he could not get away with what most audiences today would consider no big deal.I think De Palma did that on purpose too, cause I see the same vibe in another period piece he made, the Untouchables, as well, I've seen it in Mission Impossible.De Palma got a really good cast that puts you in that period as well. Josh Hartnett got to act along side Aaron Eckhart who's a really good actor. Plus Scarlett Johansson easily looks like a women from that era. The costumes and the sets all gel together really well to complete the mood. I love how modern cinematographers tend to shoot golden age Hollywood in a way that makes California feel sunny and Romantic at the same time (Usually a sunny and romantic California that hides a very dark underworld). Plus this guy was pulling out all the Hicthcock style shoots and angles.Black Dahlia is definitely a De Palma film worth seeing, a dark tale about the criminal underbelly of the gorgeous Hollywood of yesteryear, it's a unsung gem that can shine the high notes like Roman Polanski's Chinatown (if only it was made during the same time frame)http://cinemagardens.com",The Black Dahlia
58,elshikh4,Pupilpiece !,2,22 July 2014,"Brian De Palma is one of my favorites. I love how stylish he is. But considering his last movies, I have to reconsider!In 2000, he made Mission to Mars. It was no Brian De Palma classy horror, thriller, action. It was no good movie. And I was no satisfied. OK. The rule says: ""Every good director is allowed to do one not good movie."" In 2002, he made Femme Fatale, which extremely infuriated me, being the last thing I excepted from him: A sophisticated soft porn! OK. The rule can be rephrased: ""Every good director is allowed to do bad movie!"". However in 2006, when he made The Black Dahlia, it turned into: ""Every bad director is free to do bad movies!""The script runs as an old-fashioned 1940s noir, mixed with the 2000s heavy sex, having its good twists. Although I hated its soporifically long and semi-unnecessary first act, dispensable earthquake, and way of throwing nudity more than clues; but the casting and the directing were the actual criminals. They almost killed everything!Sure talking about ugly casting pushes directly to one name. Yes, it's the same name that jumps in your mind at this very moment: Josh Hartnett, or Josh - have mercy on us dear god - Hartnett! Well, it's in Webster that he isn't a fine actor, or an actor in the first place. He has no eyes to express, nor face, nor talent; regarding his eyes, he seems like a low-grade clone of Richard Gere. He was unconvincing to the max as a tough guy, police investigator, or anything. For little instance, while he was watching the murdered girl's screen tests, you couldn't tell; was he angry?, was he in love?, was he hungry? The tragic dilemma wasn't just his statue-like face, but - more - in the strange way De Palma shot that face, with no appropriate lighting or clever angle that could fix these problems. So maybe De Palma was happy with Hartnett's weakness, or so weak in dealing with it!Aaron Eckhart isn't as awful as Hartnett, nevertheless can't be a co-star of a movie. He's deprived of charisma, and spent all the time between shouting and mimicking the reaction of someone suffers constipation! (Scarlett Johansson)? Anyone?? Really!! My best guess she was doing a cigarette ad within the movie! And can Mia Kirshner be a Hilary Swank look alike?? In fact, the resemblance between them is exactly as the one between Tom Cruise and Arnold Schwarzenegger!The sets mistranslate the events and the characters. For example, the 2 detectives live in a lavish villa (??), where nothing speaks about the residents of it or the relationships in it. The decadent rich family lives in a mansion that feels regular, and - save a stuffed dog - has no dark, or basically expressive, element. As for the cinematography, I don't know who decided to drown the image in yellow and brown colors? What was the goal? Embodying how old the time was, or how sick the crimes were? I only know that that was visually boring and uncreative, looked as if a stupid way to cut down the budget, not to mention made me sick myself. Speaking about sick leads to the sex factor. Clearly this movie enjoys having filthy scenes, rather a pervert nature. And with more of that lately, I begin to believe that Hollywood is in the road to be a porn factory!Dopplegangers or evil twins, and Femme Fatales, are frequently present in De Palma's movies, such as this one. The thing is De Palma himself isn't present in this one! Don't tell me about the extended shot, the slow-motion, or the strange angles. They are here, but poorly made and trivially effective. His poems of thrilling sequences, which bewitched us in earlier movies, are gone short, dull or vanished. All the scenes are greatly bland, without De Palma's once familiar glamorous touch. That guy accustomed us to how the usual scene in his movies must be unusual. This round, it's deliberately poisoned with huge amount of ""usual"". The thrill isn't pictured well, or even there. Sometimes the script plans for a creepy moment, though the directing successfully disappoints it; like the moment of discovering the painting. Other moments miss any distinction; like when the lead destroys the mansion's curios which was executed in a way any trite TV movie would do. Long, and hard, story short: I'm forced to think that De Palma didn't direct it; it was someone else, executive at best, who looked like him, and used his name (talking about doppelgangers!).If one thing is perfectly done in this wretched movie, then it has to be its pungent satire. It's where the upper class is worst than the devil, living in non-stop crazy sins, contracting the human decay. And the proletariat, while being partly seduced by the latter class, is the closest chance to have a moral hero. It's common in noir movies to face a world of degeneration. And this time, it's well constructed, maybe the sole ""well"" thing around!So, with lifeless first act, lead actor, and director; The Black Dahlia is more dead than the real Black Dahlia! Though, in my leniency's furthest degree, I'll sentence it as average conventional noir; which's still painful as it's made by a director who has a very good reputation. As I said earlier, De Palma is one of my favorites, yet his last work isn't. He used to deliver, nearly every time, a masterpiece, not another movie. Now it's mostly pupilpiece or simply.. another movie. Whether the 2000s isn't his decade, or he became like his inspirer professor, Alfred Hitchcock, in his last days: Unimpressive!..To end it with a positive point, The Black Dahlia is more exciting than Mission to Mars, and less bad than Femme Fatale.",The Black Dahlia

But Eckhart sure played a major part in bringing The Black Dahlia (TBD, for short) down to its sub-par level, but fast.TBD was the sort of below-average picture that quickly encouraged this viewer to keep his remote firmly in hand with index-finger waiting impatiently to press the fast-forward button at a split-second's notice.Here's a movie whose 2-hour running time could have easily been edited down to 90 minutes. And it's also a movie which proved that director Brian De Palma is clearly no longer a master of his craft as a film-maker (as he was once considered to be by many film buffs).As well - TBD was an atrociously dull and totally inaccurate re-telling of a true murder case that had shocked the public silly and sent the LAPD on a wild-goose chase back in 1947.Regardless of its $50 million budget and its meticulous attention to period detail, TBD was far from coming close to being a first-rate production on any level.And when it eventually came down to this film's final revelations (concerning the true identity of Elizabeth Short's murderer), it was such a stupid, laughable joke, that it wasn't even worth the 110-minute wait at all.",The Black Dahlia

63,XweAponX,I'm surprised to the bad reaction to this film,10,10 May 2007,"I have a problem: I am swayed by bad reviews. But I have found out through 30 years of experience that if a lot of people say something is bad, that I ought to see it.I had seen this film on the rental shelves for about 3 months before I finally rented it: I watched it. Then I watched all of the extra stuff. Then I watched the film a second time. The next day I watched it again.So, first off, it is well cast. A highly distracted person (IE, someone who is too busy getting popcorn or continuously getting up to answer the phone or go to the bathroom) is highly apt to give this a poor review, probably based on Aaron Eckharts performance, which does not seem to make sense.A film shows you certain things about what is going on, a good film actually reveals itself in the first few acts, and gives the viewer all kinds of clues as to what is going on. The pleasure comes when you are still surprised by the outcome even with such clues in place.With the above in consideration, I had to know that there was a reason for Eckharts insane obsession with the case. Maybe I was let down a little with that reason (Which I will not give as it is a spoiler) but I was happy with the fact that there WAS a reason for his irrational behavior.Most of the cast was fairly acceptable. I was considerably happy that Hilary Swank was given a more exotic role to play in direct contract to roles she has played recently. The girl who played the actual Black Dahlia was an incredible find.If you want to enjoy this film, watch it and pay attention to it- Depalma rarely disappoints. A lot of people however, might be disturbed by the subject material, and if that is the source of the ""public opinion"" of this film, than that is understandable.What people do not understand, is that this film is acted and played out just like a black and white film from the late 40's- Early 50's.Classic film buffs probably love this, but I am sure that the person who goes to movies with a lot of explosions, car chases, and fake looking CGI will not like it at all.My only complaint is that it was not filmed in B&W- But the sets, and the locations... I believed I was in ""Hollywoodland"" so to speak.I just had to add this, after browsing through the BAD reviews of this film:I respect the movie-making PROCESS too much to just say nothing about this... What would this kind of activity be? Take the time and go through the negative reviews- And you will see that there are a few duplicates. Actually, more than a few... Quite a few. What is that? What does it mean? What would that be called? Shills? It is like in Mr. Smith does to Washington, that fat guy played by Edward Albert - got on the phone and told all these people exactly what to say. Call out the Hoi Polloi, right? I can't tell for sure, but it FEELS like that happened here. If we shave out 60% of the negative reviews, then we will see the honest public opinion of this film.",The Black Dahlia
64,Chris_Docker,Cinematic aesthetic taking precedence over Ellroy,8,17 September 2006,"A James Ellroy neo-noir novel, a particularly brutal murder in 40s L.A., two hardened cops and two of the most beautiful actresses of today's screen. But if that influenced you to see Black Dahlia you might feel had. More obscure than LA Confidential and more art-house than Sin City, The Black Dahlia is Brian de Palma at his most perverse and stylistic as he goes out on a limb to make a movie that bucks all expectations.Usually when we see a movie, a number of things might combine as we form an overall judgement - the story, the acting, the way it's put together, and the dialogue. Maybe we enjoy watching our favourite stars, or maybe we are influenced by how much effort have to make (if it's a continental film). Occasionally, our initial perceptions are overturned, and this is what I experienced with The Black Dahlia.The Black Dahlia is an intensely visual experience. The opening scenes I found boring in the extreme. Muted, washed out, sepia tones conveyed a tediousness that wasn't enlivened by the snatched conversations that were too quick to follow. All my senses were deadened and I almost felt like walking out. Then the camera catches Scarlett Johansson in profile, her deep red lips challenging the monotony of all that had gone before. That flash of scarlet embedded itself in my brain, surfacing again a few scenes later as life returns to the spectacle - this time in the form of bright red blood. The lighting effects and leitmotivs continue throughout. At one point, as Johansson and her beau guess the truth, the scene momentarily has a flash of normal bright lighting, but this quickly fades - as if the truth is too much to bear.The film is based on a fictionalised account of a real event (not the incident itself). The audience is pushed further and further back from the 1940s as if we are viewing it through a smoke-covered screen and listening to it with ear-mufflers on. Reality is suppressed, a dim memory. We cannot see it like it was, we cannot understand it like it was, and what we are seeing is not even a version of the truth but a version of a version. This is a film where the plays on our senses become more fascinating than the story itself, not because the story isn't deeply intriguing, but because the director forces us to view it through a lens that uncompromisingly makes us look at style instead of substance. It's about film-making aesthetic and, love it or hate it, De Palma insists that you play his game rather than get involved in the considerable crime content.The storyline itself concerns the real-life murder and disembowelment of aspiring actress Elizabeth Short and how the investigation affects two former boxers turned hard-boiled cops. Dwight (Josh Hartnett, from Sin City) and his partner Lee (Aaron Eckhart, Thank You for Smoking) try to unravel a serpentine plot that takes them through the smuttier side of old Los Angeles. Ghosts from the past surface as Lee gets hooked on benzedrine. Scarlett Johansson, Lee's live-in bad-girl-gone-good, and Hilary Swank, a bisexual temptress with a rich dad and mad mom, between them pave the way to hell and heaven with seductive charms and it's hard to tell which one is femme fatale and which one is genuine (You find out at the end, but your brain will be working overtime by then to keep up, as loose ends are woven together with a speed that makes Hitchcock look positively geriatric).Black Dahlia is De Palma at the height of his artistic auteurship, but his style will so annoy the average viewer that you should think carefully before going to see it.",The Black Dahlia
65,MaxBorg89,"Stylish, violent and compelling - in other words: De Palma as we like him!",8,12 October 2006,"Right from the beginning, The Black Dahlia was going to be a double-edged sword: it was a great opportunity for Brian De Palma to regain critics and audience's trust after a not-so-good decade (the awful Femme Fatale being the climax). After all, this is the kind of film he tends to do really well ( anyone who has seen Scarface and The Untouchables can confirm this). On the other hand, there was a risk of underachievement if comparisons were to be made with L.A. Confidential, the modern noir classic that proved James Ellroy (who also wrote The Black dahlia) can be brought to the screen.No need to worry, then: not only is Dahlia De Palma's best film since Carlito's Way, it's also a worthy ""prequel"" to Curtis Hanson's crime masterpiece.In terms of recreating the atmosphere, the film is flawless, as the marvelous cinematography and sublime production design make us believe we really are in '40s Los Angeles. It's in this lost era that we meet two cops, Dwight ""Bucky"" Bleichert (Josh Hartnett), the movie's narrator, and Leland ""Lee"" Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart). These two friends have very few in common, but what they share is significant: they work together, they both used to be boxers in the past (the movie opens with a fight between the two), and they form an unconventional love triangle with Kay Lake (Scarlett Johansson). Oh, and there's one case that's gonna alter their lives radically.One day, a corpse is found in the middle of the street. It's the body of a woman, later identified as Elizabeth Short (Mia Kirshner), a struggling actress, who has been cut in two and severely mutilated in unspeakable ways and places. As of today, it's America's most notorious unsolved case. And pretty soon, it turns into an obsession for the protagonists: Blanchard loses his sleep as he desperately wants to find the perpetrator, while Bleichert starts checking out Elizabeth's acquaintances, including Madeleine Linscott (Hilary Swank), a bisexual prostitute and Dahlia-lookalike. As for Kay, all she can do is watch as a dead woman destroys the lives of the men she loves.The Black Dahlia is a real comeback for De Palma, who has lost none of his skills and gets to apply them with a master's touch. He's always been like a kid in a candy shop when dealing with the perverse, ugly sides of society, and in this movie he has the chance to cut loose. As usual, he examines the thin line between appearance and reality, as seen in Body Double, where the main character discovered the truth by watching porn films (in this case, Bleichert keeps analyzing Elizabeth's ""audition reels"" in search for clues), and also pays homage to Hitchcock's Vertigo while he's at it (the resemblance between two women, the name Madeleine). But he's never been more at ease than when it comes to violence. From the opening boxing game to a series of shootouts, De Palma films blood and death with inspired camera angles and movements, but without glorifying the violence: it remains brutal, lurid and shocking (I'm actually surprised the movie got away with a 15-rating in the UK).In a world like this, characters are key, and the actors are impressive: Hartnett, despite being a bit too fresh-faced, convinces as the lonesome detective, but is out-acted by Eckhart, a tragic, angry force of nature, reminiscent of Russell Crowe's Bud White. And in his ladies, De Palma has found the heart of the movie. Johansson is very intense as the mysterious ""woman caught in the middle"". Swank's femme fatale (a more feminine role at last) is an unforgettable presence. And Kirshner, seen only in flashbacks and film reels, breaks your heart, making you really root for the unfortunate Elizabeth Short.The film's only problem is Fiona Shaw (aka Harry Potter's aunt), whose embarrassing overacting makes her scenes (she plays Swank's mother) bring the movie close to the ridiculous. In the end, though, The Black Dahlia is a riveting picture, and a great return to form for De Palma. Let's just hope he maintains this quality level from now on.",The Black Dahlia
66,drownnnsoda,Fictional Telling Of A Historic Crime.,8,15 September 2006,"After seeing the trailer for ""The Black Dahlia"", I was hooked on this movie. The trailer was excellent, and I was pumped for this film. In the least, it was a bit of a letdown, but unlike many people who despise this film, I didn't think it was nearly as bad as some say it is.""The Black Dahlia"" is a fictionalized story based around a real-life crime of aspiring actress Elizabeth Short, adapted to the screen from the also fictional novel by James Ellroy. The film revolves around Bucky Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) and Lee Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart), who are two Los Angeles detectives living in the 1940's. After working together on a series of crimes, Bucky becomes close friends with Lee and his girlfriend, Kay (Scarlett Johansson). On January 15th, 1947, a body of a woman is found in a vacant lot, beaten to death, sliced in half, with slash marks along both sides of her face, giving her a ""clown's grin"". Bucky and Lee investigate into the case, and Lee becomes obsessive over finding the murderer. Turns out the body is of aspiring actress Elizabeth ""Betty"" Short (Mia Kirshner). As Bucky investigates, he is drawn into Elizabeth's short-lived life. While questioning possible witnesses at a local lesbian nightclub frequented by Elizabeth and friends, he comes across Madeleine Linscott (Hilary Swank), who holds a dark secret. As the case continues and he is drawn deeper into the life of the ""Black Dahlia"", Bucky's life spins out of control and he finds himself immersed in the middle of a dark crime with more secrets and deception than he's aware of.To say right off the bat, De Palma is a superior director. I'm a huge fan of his movies (mostly his older horror films), and since I was familiar with the actual Black Dahlia case (and find true crime highly interesting), this movie seemed like the perfect film for me. Well, it wasn't perfect. But I can't really say it was awful either. The entire film is done with stylish 1940's noir style, which is both clever and creative, the audience feels like they've almost entered a time warp. Everything from the sets, the costumes, and the classic crime-style film editing (screen splitting transitions and such) add to the film's vintage atmosphere. The cinematography is beautiful and there were some brilliant shots, everything looked great and I have no complaints in that department. The acting is also top-notch as far as I'm concerned. Surprisingly Josh Hartnett plays the role of Bucky well, I'm used to seeing him in mostly teenage-aimed films, but he pulls off the role well. He and Aaron Eckhart made a good team, both giving good performances, and Scarlett Johansson does the Kay character well. Hilary Swank plays the femme fatale precisely and does an excellent job too, probably one of the best performances of the film. Mia Kirshner brings the Elizabeth Short character to life through flashback sequences and recorded footage, and while her character is mostly off screen, she plays her part with perfection, invoking a perfect sense of pathos and sympathy for Elizabeth, who isn't as innocent as she appears in her movie screen tests.Now that I've mentioned the strong points, I'll move onto the not-so-strong points. The story, while it is purely fictional, is interesting but a little incoherent at times. I haven't read the book, so I can't really compare, but the plot seemed to drag a little in the film. It focused on the characters' involvement in a love triangle a lot (which isn't necessarily bad), but it almost becomes unconcerned with the ""Black Dahlia"" case, putting it's focus on other things for long periods of time. The large amount of time spent on this causes the last twenty minutes or so to be a little rushed, cramming in explanations and revelations of the murder case as fast as possible, ending the film with a rather far-fetched and abrupt conclusion. I can't say the time spent on the love triangle and such was negative, but I think that instead of rushing the last act of the film to make up for wasted time, they could've just extended it a little instead of giving us a load of revelations about the murder all at once. This is my only real complaint, but other than that the film was great. I'm going to have to pick up a copy of Ellroy's novel so I can compare it to the film.And as a side note, which I've already mentioned, this film is purely fictional. It's not ""based on a true story"". In fact, the only thing that's actually real in the film is the murder of Elizabeth Short. Other than that, all of the subplots of the relationships between the characters (and the characters themselves), the lesbianism and stag film that Elizabeth starred in, and the conclusion of the killer's identity was all fictionalized (although these elements make the story much more interesting). To this day, the Black Dahlia case itself remains unsolved, and more than likely always will. We will probably never know who really killed the real Elizabeth Short.To sum things up to this long review, ""The Black Dahlia"" is a great film-noir done with highly stylish direction and topped with near-perfect performances. While the film's plot does drag in some points and becomes a little muddled, with all things considered, it was a great movie. I agree that this film wasn't quite as great as it had the potential to be, but it's still worth the while. If you know a lot about the actual Black Dahlia case, you'll have to disregard all of the real facts when seeing this film, otherwise you will hate it. But fans of classic film-noir and early crime films (plus De Palma fans) will love this. Sadly, many people will be disappointed due to the highly promising yet misleading advertising. 8/10.",The Black Dahlia
67,fertilecelluloid,"Flat, constipated bore",2,16 September 2006,"I wanted to love it, but Brian De Palma's ""The Black Dahlia"" is a flat, paceless, uninvolving, constipated bore. It bears few of the director's signature set pieces, and possesses none of the energy of classics like ""Body Double"". ""Dressed To Kill"", ""Blow Out"" and ""Scarface"". Based on the rambling, seedy novel by James Elroy, which I read and enjoyed very much over a decade ago, this filmization of the novel fails in its casting, structure and set design. Although the film's period Los Angeles has all the trappings of ye olde Hollywoodland, it looks like a movie set. Josh Hartnett is totally unconvincing in his central role, as is the highly masculine Hillary Swank as a ""femme fatale"" (give me a break! she belongs in an Almodovar movie!) who sucks Hartnett into a convoluted web and her unappealing mouth. Scarlett Johannsen, who looks ravishing in a shot or two, is weak as water, and owns little screen presence. The narrative is unbelievably matter-of-fact and most of the film's surprise ""revelations"" are plain silly. More conservative critics have focused on the film's ""sleaze"" and ""trashiness"". If ONLY there was more sleaze and trash. This is lightweight film noir that will will send most viewers back to the video store to rent the DVD of ""LA Confidential"", an excellent adaptation of another Elroy novel. This turgid celluloid clunker is something I will soon forget.",The Black Dahlia
68,MarieGabrielle,"Less histrionics, more history... DePalma bought script from David Lynch...",7,14 April 2011,"Anyone really interested in the actual Black Dahlia murder case will need to do more reading, and not look to this film. This film is not completely bad, Josh Hartnett is actually rather good, but the story itself gets lost. This script was originally acquired by Lynch, who could have done something interesting, and relevant with it.That being said the visuals are good here. Noir inspired pictures of ""Hollywoodland"" initially a housing development which is where the supposed murder takes place. The Danish modern look of the furniture, the visuals of the victim, stark and ripped apart.There is some confusion to the story here, the Hillary Swank character and lesbian scenes are overdone for cheap effect, also Swank is very amateur with some affected accent here. Not sure what she is trying to mimic but it comes off as phony.Fiona Shaw is good as drunken wife of a corrupt man, who I'm assuming is a disguised character here. Possibly Dr. George H. Hodel? In the film he is an art collector and film producer: In real life Hodel was a medical doctor who served as Director of Health Services in Los Angeles, sexually transmitted diseases.(He also performed the abortions in Hollywood of that time, which were illegal).The murder was somehow an act of revenge, and the ""Glasgow, or Cheshire smile"" is actually a common method from Scotland when gangs would cut the victims mouth while he/she is still alive, and it would widen as they are screaming, and dying. Indeed, Dr. Hodel in real life was brought to court in the 1940's for the incest rape of his daughter Tamar, who has gone on record recently again with this story.In the actual case there were a few actual suspects, the usual confessors (for attention), but the case was never solved. Some cited corruption, which exists, as it does in any bureaucracy.Overall this is a story which many have interest in and could be re-made. Maybe less histrionics and more history. The case itself was noted by Jack Webb (""Dragnet"" author) as ""solved"" interesting that the public has never been educated on this angle. It does certainly seem like a type of cover-up.If you are interested in the real story I can recommend the book ""Black Dahlia Avenger"" by Steve Hodel, also a retired detective from LAPD. George Hodel was his father. While the case is not conclusively proved, we do get a picture of what life was like during the 1940's Hollywood, and of other suspects, who could have committed the indelible, horrific murder of Elizabeth Short.",The Black Dahlia
69,jaybob,Ellroy & De Palma What a combo,7,2 February 2007,"James Ellroy writes very graphic novels, Brian De Palma directs graphic films. In THE BLACK DAHLIA they combine their talents & create a film depicting various people who were or may have been involved in the unsolved murder of Elizabeth Short (known as The Black Dahlia).The period is 1947, the place Los Angeles,California. In watching this multi-layered tale unfold, I was transported back to 1947.Just like in our memories of past events,certain things do get confused as to time & place.Please ignore the few anachronisms, & just enjoy the trip to the past and watch the creative minds of Writers, Director and actors doing there craft,This film is more about the people involved with the dead girl than the crime itself.It has many sub-plots going on at the same time,& by the end of the movies, we do get a solution to nearly every plot point.ALL the major plot turns however are resolved. AThe film is long, & somewhat confusing at times,This is normal for both Mr.Ellroy's books & Mr. DePalma's films. They both take their time in developing their works.Josh Harnett & Aaron Eckart are 2 of the police detectives involved. Scarlet Johannson & Hillary Swank play gals involved with our 2 cops.At times the acting may seem over or underdone, all the actors involved seem to mature as each scene further develops. I think Mr. DePalma did this on purpose. The acting is good by all involved.For those who have seen HBO's ROME will recognize the actor who plays the Coroner. Most of the other actors seem to be from the period portrayed.NOTE This is not a great film by any means, BUT it also is not the bad film that many say it is.RATING *** (3 out of 4) 83 points(out of 100) IMDb 7(out of 10)",The Black Dahlia
70,aharmas,Modern Noir,10,16 September 2006,"There are so many things to like about this film that it is hard to even consider the minor problems one encounters in its final third. True, it's a complex resolution, and some members of the audience are going to find something to complain about; yet overall, the film delivers, and when it shines, it's amazing.Brian De Palma has been an underrated talent for most of his career. People have found some of his films objectionable because of their content. Interestingly enough, critics and other award organizations had no problem honoring people like Scorcese, even though his films are characterized by much violence, too. Still De Palma has given us classic cinema moments and has directed some terrific award winning performances as well. In here, there are two outstanding turns: Aaron Eckhart and Hilary Swank. The former shines as the complex and mysterious cop who might have a few skeletons in his closet, and Swank tears the screen with her femme fatale that honors the film noir tradition that De Palma has fully revived in ""Dahlia"".The film has an impeccable production team that recreates a period that was exciting and remarkable in cinema. Here are the dark parts of the city with its very interesting inhabitants. If you are in a noir film, odds are you have something questionable in your past, and ""Dahlia"" doesn't disappoint introducing us to people who have no qualms taking advantage of others, or having no remorse at all, regardless of how depraved the crime might be.I like the way De Palma balances innocence and evil, and how nothing is truly black and white. Did Short bring upon her the terrible fate that she met? Was is it just plain luck that she ran into the sick people who eventually destroyed her? How does one justify such actions? There is no judgement offered by De Palma, but he tempts to audience to weigh in an opinion and still leaves you full of questions.The film is no ""Chinatown"". That was a masterpiece where every element was perfectly balanced. Here there is something missing at the core and some casting choices might be questonable. However, Swank recalls the great cinema actresses of the noir era and does the stereotypes justice. She makes the experience enjoyable. If ""Hollywoodland"" had someone like De Palma at the helm, that film would have caught fire. Or I wonder what would have happened if Diane Lane had played one of the female parts here? I'm glad De Palma had a chance to work on this film and present us with a rare treat, a film that dares to go where few do. It's a great film.",The Black Dahlia
71,Jonny_Numb,"""Forget it, Jake, it's 'The Black Dahlia'""",7,25 September 2006,"Brian De Palma is something of an enigma when it comes to what he puts on-screen: from his early Hitchcockian thrillers (""Sisters,"" ""Dressed to Kill"") to big-budget Hollywood items (""The Untouchables,"" ""Snake Eyes""), he is a director who can churn out something truly wretched (""Raising Cain"" and ""Mission to Mars"" come to mind), only to stage a triumphant--or at least semi-triumphant--return to form a few years later.Such is the case with ""The Black Dahlia,"" a stylish, messy, but generally intriguing adaptation of James Ellroy's novel. The story follows two detectives in 1940s Los Angeles, both steeped in corruption but generally virtuous characters. During a stakeout that turns into a bloodbath in broad daylight, De Palma establishes several plot threads via the use of a brilliant, several-minute crane shot. I'll keep all but one hidden: the discovery of a female body (Elizabeth Short, played in archival footage by Mia Kirshner), cut in two, blood drained. The case becomes an obsession to Sgt. Leland Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart), who--like Bud White in ""L.A. Confidential""--has a personal reason for wanting to nab the murderer. Meanwhile, Officer Dwight Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) falls prey to a succession of Femme Fatales, finally becoming entangled in a (jerkily-assembled) web of deception.Will ""The Black Dahlia"" make much sense to a viewer unfamiliar with the novel or actual case (myself included)? That all depends on how much effort you're willing to put into deciphering Josh Friedman's intricate screenplay, which would have been more successful (and clear) if the film had been given an additional 20 minutes to iron out its wrinkles. While De Palma's third act crams too many revelations into too short a time, the style, performances, and suspense doesn't falter.When all else fails, ""The Black Dahlia"" is a feast of visual beauty captured in period costumes and settings. The cast is absolutely ravishing, from Harnett's and Eckhart's flawed detectives; Scarlett Johansson's damaged, secretive blonde; Hilary Swank's raven-haired bisexual socialite; and Mia Kirshner's scenes as the ill-fated Short, which portend a small window of chilling insight into a tragic, desperate figure.""The Black Dahlia"" is, at heart, a would-be mainstream Film Noir, and while De Palma's effort falls short of Roman Polanski's ""Chinatown"" (a portion of the yardstick by which the genre is measured) and Curtis Hanson's ""L.A. Confidential,"" it remains a well-done, fascinating flick. While it may prove too complex for casual viewers looking for a typical 'popcorn movie,' those who enjoy deciphering celluloid puzzles will find much to like (even if, in the end, they discover more than a few dead ends).",The Black Dahlia
72,ShootingShark,Interesting And Pretty-Looking But Unabsorbing Hollywood Murder Mystery,5,12 July 2010,"In 1947 in Hollywood, Bleichert and Blanchard are two cops assigned to the case of a dismembered would-be starlet. There are no clues, Blanchard is wound too tight, and his wife has eyes for her husband's partner. Can Bleichert stay cool and solve the mystery ?This is an extremely handsome, intriguing thriller, in the vein of Chinatown or Someone To Watch Over Me, but for me is something of a disappointment. It seems to have all the right ingredients - great sets and locations, pretty people, plenty of sex and violence, an interesting setup - but it never quite jumps up and grabs you. I think there are several reasons for this. It's a bit messily scripted, with unnecessary scenes like the ones with Hartnett's father, and Swank's cuckoo family are funny but far too obviously the villains. Hartnett gives a guarded performance but his hero is hard to like and very uneven; jaded cynic one moment and cry-baby moralist the next. Perhaps most of all though, DePalma's direction is too straightforward, too mainstream - where are the mad moments, delicious set-pieces or crazy action scenes which elevate his work into the realms of genius ? It's still a stylish picture however, particularly in terms of Dante Ferretti's exquisite design work and a big mushy traditional score by Mark Isham. It's also shot by the great Vilmos Zsigmond (who worked on what is arguably DePalma's best film, Blow Out), but whilst it looks great it simply doesn't pop somehow - we've seen all these shots before in other movies. The cast are variable. I didn't like any of the three leads but Swank is terrific as the seriously twisted lady in black; is there any type of role she can't play ? Kirshner is also great in the dead girl test reels, getting exactly the right haunted victim tone needed to spark our interest in her fate, and reliable old pro Starr is solid as the senior detective. Note also Finley as the creepy bespectacled weirdo George - he first played a nerdy killer in DePalma's Phantom Of The Paradise thirty-three years earlier ! Also, it's DePalma's voice on the screen test scenes, and the singer in the dyke club doing the big smoochy number is lesbian icon K.D. Lang. Based on the fictional novel by James Ellroy (L.A. Confidential), which is inspired by the real-life murder of Elizabeth Short, a notorious and unsolved Hollywood mystery which has directly inspired several other books and movies, as well as a pretty good 1998 computer game with Dennis Hopper and Teri Garr. Entertaining enough, this is a good movie by an average director's standards but Brian DePalma is not an average director.",The Black Dahlia
73,dierregi,Horrible piece of miscasting,4,15 November 2006,"Against my better judgment, I went to see ""The Black Dahlia"". It can be summarized as a horrible piece of miscasting. Probably De Palma wanted to bank in Hilary Swank (two-Oscars winner, Academy darling) reputation, but Swank has small brown eyes, a long, bony face and an androgynous body  absolutely not what is needed for a femme fatale. On top of that, she does not looks AT ALL like Mia Kirshner, who has big, blue eyes and a heart-shaped face. Yet, characters kept on repeating ""Swank looks so much like Kirshner"". She does not!!!! You do not look like another person just by wearing a bad wig.Josh Hartnett cannot carry a movie by himself. I think he was OK in ""Lucky number Slevin"", but that was an ensemble piece, with some great professional like Ben Kinsley and Morgan Freeman. Left almost on his own, Hartnett shows that he's merely a boy and definitely not a leading man. The part needed somebody a lot manlier like Russell Crowe, who proved to be perfect in L.A. Confidential.Even Scarlet Johannson, who so far seemed a good actress, was miscast in a role who definitely required somebody older and a little less sulky. Throughout the movie she does a little more than holding a cigarette in what she considered a sophisticated pose. Even if this is a 40's movie, it does not mean that you cannot have a single scene without people smoking, De Palma really went for the overkill with cigarettes. Finally, the music score is a bad copy of the one for ""L.A. Confidential"".Some people complained about the plot being confused, but it seems pretty straightforward to me, if one keeps in mind that the movie is about the two cops + girlfriends and only marginally about the Dahlia. As somebody pointed out, this movie could have been titled anything, except ""The black Dahlia"" as we do not get to know anything about her. Somebody else recommended the movie only to noir lovers, but I am one and I can assure you that there is absolutely nothing of the tense and desperate noirish atmosphere. And it certainly does not help that one of the key characters is played totally OTT, with grotesque results, rather than tragic ones.Read novel rather than wasting time with movie, it is a lot more entertaining and you will definitely not get confused by the plot.",The Black Dahlia
74,Samiam3,Georgious and very sloppy.,5,30 June 2010,"The Black Dahlia is a stunning and stylish noir film, and it is among the most incomprehensible stories I've ever seen. I'm not stupid, but this story is impossible to follow. It becomes too big and bold for comfort.The first half of the film is not actually that bad. It plays out a bit like Goodfellas, with the editing, but perhaps too rushed. I didn't feel like I got enough time to meet people. Although the story is subjective to the point of a cliché first person narration, I felt pretty distant from the protagonist, which kind of defeats the purpose of such a narrative choice. Whenever Josh Hartnett figures something out, we the viewers don't figure it found with him, we only get more confused.Brian de Palma's primary interest with the Black Dahlia, is appearance. The movie is absolutely golden, and antique looking, sometimes Recalling the Godfather. Hollywood never looked so beautiful. It is too bad that beauty is only skin deep, The Black Dahlia is at a loss for almost everything else. For a while it goes somewhere, or so it seems, but it doesn't. Its utter sloppiness is surprising, for such an 'upper class' feature. Deep beneath its mask of glamour, the Black Dahlia feels pretty darn lame.",The Black Dahlia
75,triple8,really strange movie.,4,3 March 2007,"SPOILERS:I really don't know what to think about this movie. I had heard it was awful, horrible, the worst etc. I really didn't think it was. But I didn't like it much either. It's rare that I'm this confused about how I feel about a particular film but in this movie's case I think certain things were great, certain things were awful and certain things were....well....just over the top.First the good. The atmosphere and look of the movie were right on target. The mystique of a modern film Noir was there in huge amounts. It would be really hard to walk away from the movie in mid stream for that reason alone. In terms of style, mood and atmosphere-10 of 10. That element was very impressive.Also impressive were some of the cast(I say some). Kirshner was excellent though she wasn't in it much which was a weak point. Eckert was marvelous. His role too should have been larger.The movie was not as gory as I expected it to be so that's a plus. There were certain gory scenes but not near as much as I thought there would be. And the end was powerful and somewhat riveting. There are elements of the movie where your just glued to your seat. And I am coming back to the moodiness again but I can't help it, that was so well done and the main reason I give this a 4 of 10.Now the bad. First off, the movie was confusing. Totally. Now maybe I should not count that as a negative but I do. It's hard to tell what's going on at times and the movie's not fascinating enough overall to make that insignificant. The story should have been more engrossing then it was. For all the moments of intrigue there were far more moments of boredom. And the first half hour is almost unwatchable.Then there are the main performers. I thought Hartnet and Johanson(of whom I am a major fan)were both miscast and I did not believe they were the people they played. Hartnet's narration added nothing to the movie and actually in my opinion, brought it down a bit. It was completely unnecessary.(He also seemed to be in almost every scene). Plus there was a lot of over the top dialog that sometimes took away from the power of the film and a scene or two that are actually kind of beyond over the top. (The dinner scene between Hartnet, Swank and the family members being a major example.) It was difficult at times to buy into the movie.And then there's Swank. I alternated between thinking she was absolutely terrific and completely over the top. Now after I have seen the whole movie I'm still not sure which one I'm leaning toward, maybe both. But she should have been in it more. The movie seemed to revolve around Hartnet and Johanson and I thought both of them were the weak links.But the main reason to see this is for the style of the movie because the way the story was told was really lacking in some other areas. It did feel like a De Palma movie a lot of times though. But if I were a professional critic I really would not recommend this overall, though I really think it's more then a 1 or 2 out of 10. However, there wasn't enough focus on things there should have been and it was to slow moving and meandering at times not to mention confusing. And it seemed unstructured as well. This movie did not flow well at all. My overall vote is slightly below average. Not really unwatchable but not one I'd say was very good.",The Black Dahlia
76,onepotato2,Standard DePalma Disaster,3,6 March 2007,"I really don't understand why fans are surprised that Brian DePalma made a mess of this. For his entire career, DePalma has been looking at other more talented directors and better movies and trying to capitalize on them. It's like he watches good movies and thinks ""I'd like to make the crappy version of this."" Usually it's Hitchcock, but here he smells a winner in being the caboose on the L.A. Confidential train. Perhaps he even deluded himself about possible golden statues, like L.A.C. received.James Elroy and DePalma have come up with the most oblique, obtuse inroad to the Black Dahlia crime, in which none of the characters in the foreground are related to the case. It's certainly one way to acknowledge that this case has narrative problems even before DePalma got his hands on it. The Dahlia case is a horrifying, memorable crime scene in search of a decent lead-up, that's it. No more than one or two details are the least bit interesting. Every solution ever proposed quickly degenerates into flunkies and convolutions that put me to sleep: humdrum characters are credited with unbelievable evil. Wherever you first read about the case, that's about as interesting as it's going to get. But you know what would be really interesting? Proposing an actual engaging, intelligent solution to what happened to Elizabeth Short; not inventing a bunch of stock characters no one cares about to drive the story; especially if your movie will monopolize the title for fifty years. The killers letters (Black Dahlia Avenger) to the police never even get a mention.You can't just cast three good looking kids and think your job is done. Here everyone is playacting at making a crime movie. And DePalma apes scenes, tone, music cues, a line (Get out of here, sh*tbird) from LA Confidential. It's not a tribute when your movie sucks. I couldn't bear even a few minutes of this because even with period costumes and filming on location in Los Angeles, if you have no interest in story or psychology (as DePalma proves over and over) you don't make interesting movies. Right from the start, the opening scene, a riot between cops and sailors, is absurd; the propmaster has supplied the sailors with identical silver painted cardboard tubes, to approximate something heavy and dangerous. Even if they looked real, where did the weapons come from, in the world of the movie? Did a street vendor come by just before the opening credits and sell everybody the same shiny new pipe? Later on the viewer wonders, ""Did people dance to any other freaking song in the 40s but ""In the Mood?"""" The big ending to this is less satisfying than Scooby Doo, any episode of which is mercifully shorter and displays more writing competence. DePalma, not a big fan of psychology, throws all credibility away on the surprise ending that everyone else here is rightfully griping about. He's so inept at film-making, shot-composition, plotting (you name it) that part of this ""big surprise,"" was ruined the instant it was presented earlier; a shadowy figure dressed in mens clothes turning out to be a woman, was clearly a woman. BDP is the man who brought you the similarly over-wrought Mission Impossible. MI's success was a fluke because every inkling in DePalma's body is to ruin a movie.The extra materials on the DVD are bewildering. Everyone (Elroy, DePalma, the producer, the screenwriter) speaks of the project like it was a success. All I can say is the drugs must be really strong. George Bush's team of liars and propagandists couldn't make this a success! Even the featurette ""The DePalma Touch presented by Volkswagen"" suggests that Volkswagen needs more competent brand managers. DePalma hasn't had a 'touch' since Carrie. Hartnett is not a bad actor (See Lucky number Slevin) but you can't put him in over his head, as he is here. Aaron Eckhardt on the other hand, is ridiculous.Fincher's ""Zodiac"" did not impress me this weekend, but now I see that at least he didn't mangle everything he touched.",The Black Dahlia
77,Galina_movie_fan,Brian De Palma's vision of the most notorious unsolved mystery:,9,15 February 2007,"I have only seen 16 movies released in 2006 and I think that ""The Black Dahlia"" (2006) directed by Brian De Palma is one of the most enjoyable. The way it walks, talks, sounds, and feels truly captivated me. It is a fantastic cinematic achievement. It is shocking, dark, very clever, and enormously beautiful. It is over the top but how would you make a movie about the investigation of the most notorious and gruesome never solved murder in Hollywood differently? I like this exploitative, overplayed, smoldering, overwhelming, cheesy, campy Crime / Drama / Mystery / Thriller (my favorite genres) with the evident elements of black comedy (the most favorite genre when it's done well). I don't deny that it has its problems but I still believe it is worth watching and rewatching, especially on DVD when you can stop it and return to the earlier scene to see what you might have missed the first time. ""The Black Dahlia"" is one of the rare films that make you forget all their flaws. I am still puzzled with the ending but I LOVE the movie; I could not take my eyes off the screen. The way De Palma uses light, shadows, his combination of colors, black and gold - my favorite, his use of stairways, and the way we first are allowed to notice the body - it is Art, noir film made by an Artist. Besides, I simply can't be indifferent to a movie that uses Cole Porter 's song ""Love for Sale"" which I adore as performed by k.d. lang.The movie grabbed me with its visual grandeur, heated atmosphere of danger, dark, desperate mood and that's why I like it so much. I don't like it for its story - after all, it is one of the myriads of versions of what had actually happened 60 years ago, I don't admire it for the acting, even though, Mia Krishner as unfortunate Betty Short was heartbreaking and I did like Hillary Swank for the first time in my life (yes, I know that she is two times Oscar winner but I liked her here, when she said to herself, ""Bucky...I'll try to remember... that"" - it was a good acting, irony which I've never seen in her before.) I also believe that Fiona Shaw was wonderful in her role - it simply could not be played any differently and to make her character so over the top was an artistic achievement and not the lack of acting abilities as many viewers seem to believe.I respect the movies that entertain me, excite me, and stay with me even if I see their weakness very well. ""Black Dahlia"" is one of these movies. I am perhaps one of very few viewers in the whole world who actually was satisfied with the ending and the big revelation before it. Yes, it is bizarre, and it is grotesque, but it fits the whole movie perfectly and when I mentioned earlier how clever the movie was, I meant, how well its creators explored just one of the evidences and using the works of literature, art, and earlier cinema, built the whole possible story behind the murder based on it. Once again, ""The Black Dahlia"" is IMO one of the best and most entertaining movies of last year which I enjoyed enormously.Directed by the Artist with a unique vision and talent, ""The Black Dahlia"" will be appreciated as time goes by.",The Black Dahlia
78,Easygoer10,"Like Children Playing ""Dressup"" In Their Parent's Clothes",3,30 January 2020,"I love Brian De Palma. That noted, he missed the mark with this woeful ""noir trash"". It reminds me of children dressing up in their parent's clothes. In other words, it is bad, and I do mean very bad. I laughed in all the wrong parts. Most of all, seeing Scarlet Johansson with a cigarette hoder that was half a foot long was the worst. All 5'3"" of her dressed up as if she were 6' tall. The very worst is Josh Hartnett's ""POV"" telling of the story. Steve McQueen (the actor) said it all: ""Use film to tell the story, not word"". That is precisely what is wrong in this film. The narrator (Hatrtnett) tells you everything you have already seen on the screen. This is a visual art: So use it. De Palma had a wonderful cast and tried to make kids look ""atmospheric"", as if we were watching Humphrey Bogart and James Cagney, with Lauren Bacall in between. It does not work. A waste of time.",The Black Dahlia
79,eric262003,I Praise The Haters Of This Trashy Flick,1,31 December 2012,"To all the ranters who thought ""The Black Dahlia"" was an awful #$%$ film I would like to stand up and applaud each and everyone of you for showing the courage to utter your hatred to one of the worst movies that ever hit the silver screen. And all the praisers who pandered at the film, well who am I to judge?The travesty proceeds with the pointless Zoot Suit riots. Why? Don't ask me it just happened that way. Then we have a little boxing confrontation between two gentlemen who would later materialize into crime fighting partners. And again I ask myself, what's the point of the boxing match? Again your guess is as good as mine. But I digress, I was eating my lunch and I became more interested in my panini than I was to this pathetic excuse for a movie.Well in my awkward attempts to stay intrigued, we see our heroes Lee Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) and Bucky Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) are on the prowl interrogating pimps. from my observation. n spite of their partnership there is some sexual rivalry because Bucky takes a liking for Lee's girlfriend Kay Lake (Scarlett Johansson). After 25 into the fray we finally get into the The Black Dahlia murder. They start to get into the investigation because through flawed irony they just happened to be at the right place at the right time.Then the boredom fest goes in full effect as the movie shifts into the lives of these two cops. We get some scenes involving the Black Dahlia murder, but they were so few and far between to hold my attention in fact I almost fell asleep a few times and yet I have insomnia. I mean there are four convoluted plot happening at once which makes this movie contrived.It seems as though this movie seems to be focused on the detectives and the the titular story was semi-neglected and left off as just a mere sub-story. The whole thing just #$%$ me off entirely. But seriously folks if they just wanted the Black Dahlia story to be a subplot, why did they manipulate the fans by having the poster of the movie to feature a pale-faced corpse with blood oozing out of her mouth and having the audacity into calling it ""The Black Dahlia"" in the first place to begin with? The only thing I recommend to all is to read the book by James Ellroy because I assure you that it would be much better than wasting your time with this piece of garbage. To the haters in the house I'm 100% on your side on this one.Believe me, you will thank us for this.",The Black Dahlia
80,Matt_Layden,All Style & No Substance,4,28 May 2010,"Two detectives are on the case of The Black Dahlia, which is taking a huge toll on their personal and professional lives. The Black Dahlia is a mess of a film, but what a beautiful mess it is. De Palma for all accounts is at fault here for failing to make an interesting film on a topic that should have been essentially easy to do. Everyone likes a good detective story and trying to solve the Black Dahlia case is enough to get the audience invested in the history. This film didn't even make me want to look any of the actual accounts up, which tells you how unaccomplished the film is.As I said earlier, it is beautiful to look at. Cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond and Brian De Palma have the noir style down perfect in Dahlia and whenever I got bored, which was 90 percent of the film, I would try to get lost in the atmosphere this film creates. Everything is in the right place, yet only the look of the film manages to make me smile.Josh Hartnett seems miscast in the lead role that required someone with more gravitas. He still has that boyish charm to him and the role required someone with a harder core shell. Someone along the lines of his partner, Aaron Eckhart. Hilary Swank plays Madeleine Linscott, she always seems to rub me the wrong way with her acting choices. This one is no different. How she has two Oscars is unknown to me. Scarlett Johansson is given nothing in this film to do and if she had something, I doubt she would have been able to pull it off.This film has too many subplots involving the characters that the case itself seemed to play second fiddle. This shouldn't be the case when your film is called The Black Dahlia. It's hard to see that this film was directed by the guy who also gave us Scarface, The Untouchables and Snake Eyes...okay, maybe I'm alone on that one. I would advise against watching this film as it fails to ignite any interest in the case or what the story should actually be about. Character relationships seem really odd and written by someone who has no real thoughts or intentions with them. The Black Dahlia should be having people look the murder up and discuss, much like Fincher's Zodiac. This film doesn't do any of that, it feels like it wants to be another film entirely. De Palma has always been hit and miss with me and this entry is showing me that he has lost a lot of what people thought was talent. Not Recommended, especially for those wanting to know more about the case itself.",The Black Dahlia
81,elliotjeory,Awful,2,16 February 2021,"If you're interested in the Black Dahlia case, this film isn't for you. I would recommend a documentary instead. This film is basically two cops fighting over Scarlett Johansson. It's really corny too like Josh Harnett's voiceover. Avoid.",The Black Dahlia
82,denis888,Even Great Filmmakers Sometimes Fail,1,29 September 2007,"Brian De Palma is a great filmmaker, by all means. But he is a human, and, like all human beings, he fails. This is what exactly happened when he had decided to produce The Black Dahlia. Mind it, as a portrait of post-war America, this movie is very successful. Also, it shows the routine of police work and Hollywood wannabes very well. And it works. But then, as the movie develops, it becomes a large and major disillusionment. Josh Hartnett can be a better actor than here. Here, he only frowns and makes deep, thoughtful expressions, or, sometimes (Oooh, a variety!) he does shoe some sadness. Scarlet Johansson also does not shine. She wars her clothes well, she had very bright lip-gloss, and that is all. She wears all the same tragic facial expression and it never changes, whether she makes love to Josh or makes food to him and Aaron Elkhart, who is not a very bright star here, as well. Maybe, only Hillary Swank really plays, and her dark, sinful and lascivious heroine seems very realistic. All the rest of the film, with its dismembered corpses, too much blood and shootings, simply flows by and leaves no lasing expression. 2 hours gone, and so what? Well, all great people make mistakes. Here, De Palma failed, and his film, especially its last 40 minutes, seems like real farce, laughable and very unreal. After all, after watching this movie, you may feel happy that you know how bad films by good makers look like, or that you may go and watch something better.",The Black Dahlia
83,stensson,More black than dahlia,6,27 January 2007,"Brian de Palma has some cult status, maybe because he was one of the pioneers when it comes to mainstream ultra violence. This one isn't that gory; which is a little surprising thinking of the subject.Many have said that this is a film noir try. It is, but not well done. The males act in a too modern way. Scarlett Johansson is all right and so is somewhat also Hillary Swank, although she is guilty of some overplay.But the script lacks. It's all too complicated and you find it hard to remember all the names which are dropped in the beginning. If it wasn't for the short scenes with Mia Kirshner as the unhappy Dahlia, this wouldn't get 6 out of 10.",The Black Dahlia
84,MartianOctocretr5,"Plenty of atmosphere and subplots, but what about the Black Dahlia?",4,16 July 2007,"Since the Black Dahlia case was never solved, had few clues other than the perverse mutilation of the victim's body, it's easy to allow the film any license for fiction or speculation it chooses to take. The best moments of the film are the ""stock"" footage inserts of the Dahlia, Elizabeth Short, herself. Well written, skillfully shot and edited, these scenes provide the best insights into the life style of the victim. This movie's take on what might have happened is no better or worse than any other theory, but it's unnecessarily convoluted. This obviously was to set up the tough cop/Film Noir approach, and fits the '40's time frame, but there are some problems in the execution. Dark shadows, femme fatales, shady cops, and other elements of the genre are all attempted, some but not all successfully. It should be noted that there was great attention to detail in the period sets, old cars, clothing, hair styles, etc. The casting was absurd. The actors in major roles look like children wearing Daddy and Mommy's clothes, and the big clothes don't fit. Josh Hartnett trying to narrate like a Humphrey Bogart sounds like Paris Hilton lecturing on the Laws of Thermodynamics. Scarlett Johanson's pouty character looked like she belonged in a Shirley Temple comedy. Hillary Swank's ""tough and sultry"" routine was almost cartoonish (I doubt she's ever smoked in her life). Hartnett cried so much, I hoped one of the women would send him home to his Mommy. This crybaby beating up thugs twice his size was almost funny. The guy with the Scottish accent and his drunk wife looked like they were laughing at the script all the time. One scene of a murderer in silhouette is painfully obvious as to who the killer is. The endless bed scenes are not sensuous; in fact, they're so poorly done the actors themselves probably fell asleep. Way too much information about the detectives, too little about the Dahlia.Poor storytelling and execution; a big disappointment.",The Black Dahlia
85,rivertam26,ultimate monument...,6,15 September 2006,"Depalma has directed some great movies Carrie, Scarface, The Untouchables. He's directed some mediocre ones Snake Eyes, Raising Cain, The Fury and some downright horrible ones, Femme Fatale, Mission to Mars, Bonfire of the Vanities. So it comes as no surprise that Black Dahlia is a partial return to great form for the director. The problem is, is that it's only partial. Chronicling the investigation of the famous murder case. The film is complete noir with smoky subtext and luring seductresses. But when the smoke clears it's ultimately confused, jumbled and just not very believable. Although the subject matter is dreadfully disturbing the film never really seems to be happening. It's a fantasy, a pop version of the famous crime that haunted Hollywood. It's beautiful looking but like the films execution the performances are off as well. Josh Harnett is in top notch shape and his acting isn't bad but is miscast as the lead investigator, Eckhart is better as his partner but still not plausible. And the woman are downright wrong. From an intentionally pathetic and mediocre performance from Kirshner to a downright ridiculous one from the now seemingly untalented Johansson. The only one thst slightly falls into place is Swank as a lusty but slightly masculine femme fatale. The film has great moments, some are downright inspirational. From it's edgy score to its creative set pieces but the film is just off. A great movie could have been made here instead we're left with some great moments, some OK moments and some bad ones.

86,schappe1,It's the peas- and the pod,8,18 September 2006,"When I rent movies, I like to rent two at a time, usually films that have some relationship to each other. Same actor or director. Same genre or year. It's unusual to have two theatrical films come out at the same that appear on the surface to be so closely matched as ""The Black Dahlia"" and ""Hollywoodland"". Both are about unsolved Hollywood mysteries, (in the second case, we don't know for sure that it's a murder: in the first there is no doubt). The incidents happened 12 years apart, so not an awful lot changed in that time. Both films offer incites into Los Angeles and the film industries. But they really are different.The Black Dahlia is about Elizabeth Short, the wannabe actress who never actually made a film, (not even the screen tests and porn film depicted in Brian Diploma's film, which are important to the plot and the emotions of the piece but did not exist in reality). Per Wikipedia, she was never known as the Black Dahlia in life. That was a name the press gave her, after the Alan Ladd/Veronica Lake noir film that was in the theaters at the time, ""The Blue Dahlia"", which is also about the murder of a woman but otherwise unrelated to Short's story, which has been the inspiration for other films.There are about 22 supposed suspects, (and it may have been none of them), according to the Wikipedia article and McElroy/DePalma use none of them. DePalma's films have always been about homages to other films and their makers and it's another 1946 film that comes to mind here, ""The Big Sleep"", (like ""The Blue Dahlia"", a Raymond Chandler work). Here we have a dottering old millionaire with a slinky sexpot older daughter and a naughty younger daughter. Only here he has a nutty wife to boot. The older daughter is played like Hillary Swank, who seems to be trying to verify for us that she is a woman after winning two Oscars in boyish roles. She's more Jessica Rabbitt here than Lauren Bacall. On the other hand Scarlett Johansson seems to have walked in from The Blue Dahlia as she gives a naturally sexier performance that recalls Veronica Lake. But the best performance in the film comes from Mia Kirshner as Short. She becomes a tragic symbol of the failed dreams of so many who have come to Hollywood. Josh Harnett makes a capable hero, one who seems to be searching for perfection in someone and not finding it. Aaron Eckhardt tops him as his friend and rival policeman who is battling demons of his own.The film itself has the atmosphere of a true film noir. Hartnett is no Ladd or Bogart but he's living in their world. It also makes reference to DePalma's best film, ""The Untouchables"", with the scene on the stairs. It's a solid entertainment but not really a great film. Ironically, it probably would have been called ""Hollywoodland"" had it not already had a classic title, because the sign is shown and talked about several times. The murder is even committed in an abandoned housing project beneath the sign, (according to the film).The story of George Reeves' death was originally going to have the awkward moniker ""Truth Justice and the American Way"", from the famous opening of the TV show. The sign is never seen or referred to in the film. The title was just an add-on after the film was done. The film is shot in more of a flat, non-noirish way, as if the sun was always beating down from overhead. It's more of a lament than a mystery. Adrien Brody plays a classic character: the private eye whose career thusfar has been sleazy and unglamorous but happens on to the case of his career. He's also got a son by his ex-wife who is bummed out by the loss of his TV hero. Frankly, not enough of this film is about the need for heroes in a harsh world. And, in some ways this film is harsher than ""The Black Dahlia"", especially the language, (the other film is more violent and overtly sexy).More interesting is the story of Reeves, played by Ben Affleck and his relationship with Toni Mannix, the aging glamour girl played by aging glamour girl Diane Lane. Affleck is OK, at best. He looks a little like Reeves' Clark Kent when he has his glasses on but otherwise does not resemble him. Reeves was frankly a better actor than Affleck ever was, (see him in ""So Proudly We Hail"" and in the Superman series itself, which would have lasted only a few episodes if they'd just hired some muscle-man to read off of idiot cards). The famous charm and intelligence that Reeves possessed really doesn't come through in Affleck's performance. It's interesting to speculate what this film might have been like had it been made 15 years ago: might Chris Reeve had played George Reeves? But the best thing in the movie is Diane Lane, who has always been a character actress in a glamour girl's body. I note she's not had plastic surgery: there are bags under her eyes. 40 is not the new 30 for her. There are things done to age her in this film, (Mannix aged from her early 40's to her early 50's over the course of the action), but she's perfect for this role, the best of her career. She falls hard for Reeves and apart when he leaves her.The filmmakers leave all possibilities open regarding the shooting. Maybe it was Reeve's jilted fiancé. Maybe it was Eddie Mannix. Maybe it was Toni Mannix. Maybe Reeves was despondent over his career. Maybe he was high on alcohol and painkillers. As with Short, nobody knows, at least nobody who is still around. It doesn't matter. The films are about the characters and the performances. And the place.",The Black Dahlia

Are Dwight and Lee really the same person? If so, then this sort of 'twist' worked much better in 'Fight Club'. No, I would say that Brian DePalma plays with the notion, but the story stays essentially a crime noir, of which the basis was provided by Elmore Leonard, a writer who's had his own personal demons considering his book on The Black Dahlia case - a case that is still a riddle wrapped in an enigma, slowly disintegrated by the years of fading memories and dying persons of interest from the era it took place in.'Back to the film'. The wonderful L.A. backdrop (I'm curious what parts were filmed in Sofia, Bulgaria by the way - the 'house of horrors'?), DePalma's skills, the larger than life depiction of characters, the (unflinching depiction of the) horrific case of TBD, the noir style overkill and the raunchy home videos, they all add to an over the top, claustrophobic film noir in which I, unlike I read in the reviews here on IMDb, could not find one hint of comedic relief... but that may be just me. Everything is pretty much in place, except the fact that the truth of the real story probably will never come to light, and this film just goes ahead and takes a stab at it - no pun intended.

I actually am out of words to express what I think of this movie. The title raised expectations of a plot that would be worthy of my time. Many years before this movie came out there was this game called Black Dahlia (inspired on the murder of Elizabeth Short) only with a much more satisfying plot concerning the Cleveland Torso Murderer,black magic and Nazis's with one difference that the title referred to a special diamond and not the woman. The people who were also responsible for Ripper (with Christopher Walken) outdid themselves with a truly thrilling adventure. If a video game can achieve this with merely a fraction of the budget this movie got than at least you would expect more from this production. The problem is however that this movie never is meant to thrill you. Elizabeth short and her nickname is only a cheap gimmick to attract viewers. There is no mention of the Cleveland Torso Killer which to me is a far more interesting subject than the film noir/soap opera antics of the main characters. It is very hard to make sense of the story since most of it doesn't connect logically even after it is explained . Also there isn't one likable character in the movie so why should I even bother to care for any of them. And calling this movie a film noir is an insult to the genre. Go watch ""The Maltese Falcon"" to see how it is done.",The Black Dahlia
89,Cosmoeticadotcom,Bad,4,1 September 2010,"The film fails primarily for the reasons most bad films do- no screenplay of quality, and not because it is fictional and not about its titular subject, although a bit of fidelity to the real case could not have hurt. That said, even had the film been well acted, it is so convoluted and off subject that it bores, despite a plethora of needless narrative convolutions (see above), bad attempts at symbolism (Blanchard and Bleichert are known as Fire and Ice), shocking twists (when Blanchard is killed, his body is cremated in the building he died in by a gangster- why?), dull and pointless subplots (too many to enumerate), red herrings (again, too numerous), camp (Bleichert laying Kay on the kitchen table, after ripping away the tablecloth and dishes, or wearing his fedora in bed with Madeleine), loose ends (as if his shooting of Madeleine- a socialite, would not generate more press than the Dahlia's murder ever did), and 'unexpected' revelations (again, too many). What part of this mess lies with Ellroy's book (whose earlier book, L.A. Confidential, was turned into a truly great film ten years ago, by Curtis Hanson), and how much blame belong to Friedman and De Palma, is unclear, but one wonders how De Palma (always a lightweight compared to contemporaries like Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola) ever even got tagged with the label that he was Alfred Hitchcock's heir apparent (at best) and imitator (at worst). Regardless, after an atrocity like this, the dead fat man may be rising out of his grave to smite De Palma- that would make for a better film, actually!His most famous films- Scarface, Carrie, Body Double, The Untouchables, Carlito's Way- are all either campy messes, imitations of his better peers and classic films noir, or films that try to be noirish mysteries, and while The Black Dahlia is not as bad as Johnny Depp's Jack The Ripper film, From Hell, it's close. Too many details without relevance, payoff, or purpose sink the movie, and its insistence on imitating 1940s films rather than reality (which includes a focus on its titular subject matter) buries it even more deeply. Yes, Scarlett Johansson looks good, but other than her piece of eye candy (Swank, by contrast, has always looked butch), the film has little else going for it, so move over, The Bonfire Of The Vanities, there's a new contender in De Palma's pantheon of bad films, and this one's.oh, to hell with it.

90,seymourblack-1,An Intriguing Blend Of Fact & Fiction,9,6 March 2013,"""The Black Dahlia"" is an intriguing murder mystery that provides a fictionalised solution to a very famous real-life killing that took place in Los Angeles in January 1947. The complicated story is based on James Ellroy's book of the same name and features an array of interesting characters in a tale of naive dreams, exploitation, murder, obsession and corruption.The most striking feature of the movie is its wonderful visual style which makes an immediate impact and continues to impress throughout. It looks really great and also seems very convincing in the way that it recreates the L.A. of the late 1940s. It's stylishly directed and includes some marvellous set-pieces, some very fluid camera-work and a long crane shot which brilliantly links two incidents that happen simultaneously. The atmosphere is also beautifully enhanced by Mark Isham's moody score and the work of one of movie history's greatest-ever cinematographers, Vilmos Zsigmond.Lee Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) and Dwight ""Bucky"" Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) are a couple of LAPD detectives with similar career backgrounds who stake out a building in which they suspect that a child killer is present. When they see a drug deal being done in front of the building and shots are fired, Bucky chases the dealer into an alley and handcuffs him to a car and then returns to find that the other participants in the deal (a gangster and his female companion), have been killed as well as some people inside the building. In the aftermath of the shootout, numerous police vehicles arrive and it's quickly revealed that a dead body has been found on some waste ground nearby.The dead body of Elizabeth Ann Short (Mia Kirshner) had been cut in half, her face had been slashed from ear to ear and all her blood had been drained out. The newspapers exploit the sensational nature of the crime and name the victim ""The Black Dahlia"". This label's created by modifying the title of Alan Ladd's film ""The Blue Dahlia"" (1946) in recognition of the fact that Short frequently dressed in black.The two detectives who spend a lot of time together, mostly with Lee's live-in girlfriend, Kay Lake (Scarlett Johansson), soon abandon their pursuit of the child killer and devote their time to investigating the murder of the aspiring actress who'd come to Hollywood from Massachusetts to seek fame and fortune.Lee becomes totally obsessed with the murder case and this causes problems in his relationship with Kay. He's also a man with a shady past and this starts troubling him when he learns about the imminent release from prison of a violent criminal called Bobby De Witt (Richard Brake). As his behaviour becomes more erratic and he starts using Benzedrine, the two detectives work more independently of each other. Bucky discovers that De Witt was a pimp who carried out a bank robbery and that Kay was one of his girls who, in order to escape from him, had helped Lee to get him convicted.Bucky starts to identify and pursue some of the individuals who knew Elizabeth Short and this soon brings him into contact with Madeleine Linscott (Hilary Swank). She's a rich and rather mysterious woman whose eccentric family eventually provide Bucky with the information he needs to establish the identity of the murderer.Lee and Bucky had both been boxers whose talents had not been sufficient to take them to the top of the sport but had been helpful in furthering their careers in the LAPD. They got on well together and both enjoyed Kay's company. These men, however, were also different in certain respects as Lee (who had been known as ""Mr Fire"" in his boxing days) was volatile, corrupt and inclined to do things his own way, whereas Bucky (who, as a boxer, had been known as ""Mr Ice"") was more stable, ethical and conscientious. He also suffered from feelings of guilt when he had to attend the scene of a murder which had been committed by the child killer who they'd stopped pursuing to concentrate on ""The Black Dahlia"" murder.""The Black Dahlia"" contains some excellent performances and some that are hilariously over-the-top. It's also a movie that divides opinions as its convoluted plot and more bizarre passages really irritate some people. On balance, however, there's a great deal more good than bad and in some respects, it's positively stunning.",The Black Dahlia
91,antoniotierno,good noir but a little bit too stagnant,7,6 October 2006,"This Brian De Palma's noir is entertaining for its two thirds but shows a final part that is both incoherent and confusing, wherein exposition is excessive, plot gets too convoluted and labyrinthine. Plus, always in this final piece, there are too many secondary characters diverting the attention from the core of the film. On the contrary, what I liked most of this movie is its tragic grandeur along with its psychological complexity. De Palma's style is very recognizable and this time contains elements of social commentary. Its work is not up to LA Confidential but remains fascinating, although Josh Harnett lacks charisma and also screen presence.",The Black Dahlia
92,mstomaso,"DePalma Goes Period-Noir, and Brings Along his Usual Bag of Tricks",6,10 July 2007,"Like many DePalma films - Black Dahlia is gorgeous from start to finish, and features an interesting premise. Also like most DePalma films - Black Dahlia derails about 2/3rds of the way to its conclusion, and goes on for too long. Despite all of this, I had a better time with Black Dahlia than I have had with most of Mr.DePalma's recent portfolio, and had no trouble watching the film in a single sitting. Compared to the last DePalma film I watched (2nd viewing of Mission to Mars), this was a vast improvement. Black Dahlia is a convoluted piece of historic fiction which derives its inspiration from the infamous murder case of the same name and a novel by best-selling author James Ellroy. The details of the mutilations involved in the murder and the name of the deceased are two of the few things that the film depicts accurately. The film follows Detective Bleickhert (Hartnett) and his partner Blanchard (Eckhardt) as they obsess with the case and attempt to solve the murder, along with several other seemingly unrelated crimes. Plots are rarely DePalma's strong-suit, but this film's plot - had it either been simplified and streamlined or recast as a surrealist noir (think Blue Velvet) could have had great potential. As it stands, the film's script appropriately adopts a period-piece feel, but nonetheless permits a lot of noir atmosphere and convolutions to creep in. The characterization is strong and satisfying (and probably derived directly from Ellroy's original work), but the plot does devolves disappointingly late in the film (like several other DePalma pieces). Aaron Eckhardt and Hilary Swank provide excellent support for Josh Hartnett and Scarlett Johanson's leads. But Josh and Scarlett run into trouble as the story begins to derail after the midpoint of the narrative, and some of their later scenes are either poorly acted, poorly directed and cut, or all three. All three of these problems are well illustrated in one of the love scenes - and you'll know which one I mean if you see it. Although set in the period of film noir, and with a plot as convoluted as the average pulp noir, the acting and script do not fit well within the noir catalog, nor within an identifiable historic/period setting. From the extras on the DVD, I understand and applaud what the film-makers were trying to do. I do, however, think that they should have decided on one way of telling the story and then stuck with it. It is hard to imagine the reasons for the creative decisions that went into the directing of the film. The camera-work is generally excellent, but there is a substantial amount of over-acting and mediocre editing and pacing.Recommended for DePalma and period piece fans. Not recommended for Scarlett Johanson fans. AAAC for noir fans.",The Black Dahlia
93,jaredmobarak,Fire and IceThe Black Dahlia,6,19 December 2006,"I will preface this review with the fact that I am a big Brian De Palma apologist. I have not seen a movie by him that I didn't like. Whether mainstream hits like Scarface and The Untouchables, indie favs like Sisters and Femme Fatale, or even the surreal camp that is The Phantom of the Paradise, I love them all. Therefore I tried to disregard all the bad press surrounding The Black Dahlia's release as I figured no matter how bad people thought it was I would at least enjoy it. For the first three quarters or so I was really into this tale of a city's underground narrated by one of its' boxers turned cops. Even though the final act tries to sew up all loose ends of the murder, (that has never been solved in real life), very rapidly and with every character we have met during the duration, I still must admit I enjoyed the ride.With all the trailers showing footage of the beautiful Mia Kirshner as Elizabeth Short in her screen tests and the words ""Hollywood's most infamous unsolved murders"" I assumed the film was going to be about the crime and its subsequent case. Instead we are given a story around a former boxer turned police detective, Bucky Bleichert. Our narrator is surprisingly played well by Josh Hartnett who has really showed some skill over the past couple years and may not be the untalented pretty boy I first thought; even his young looks are masked at times by a face etched in the pain of life. Bleichert is trying to fix his life by getting a job he is passionate about, finding a suitable place for his dementia-ridden father, and meeting friends that he cares for. These friends are his partner Lee Blanchard, played with nice intensity by Aaron Eckhart, and Kay Lake, played unobtrusively by Scarlett Johansson. The three make an inseparable group, with the boys making a name for themselves in crime fighting. It is the coincidence of an old criminal getting out of jail and the gruesome death of young actress Short that spins their world into chaos as the leads show how fallible they are.I really enjoyed the subdued color palette and resemblance to old 40's film style that the aesthetics had. The acting was a bit over the top, especially Hilary Swank, but never went too far except in select cases. De Palma has really spun James Ellroy's novel into a hard-boiled noir that feels straight out of an old crime novel, dialogue included. With everything going on though, I believe he should have stayed with the insight into Bucky Bleichert's life. Short's Black Dahlia plays a small role in the proceedings by really only causing the spring-boarding of Blanchard's decent to vengeance and Bucky's need to be with Swank's Madeleine. By deciding to all of a sudden wrap up the case, after all parts of the main story about our trio of friends had been completed, the end feels tacked on and very rushed. It is also here where the eccentrics come out for some laughable monologues and craziness, (although I loved William Finley's role and that De Palma still finds a part for him in his new films). When Eckhart and Johansson all but disappear from the screen for large chunks of time, it is the emotions going through Hartnett's character that keep the plot moving. Once he all of a sudden becomes interested in finding Short's killer, when previously not wanting to touch the case, it works in regards that he has been in contact with the perpetrators but not to the film we have been watching.De Palma gets an A-plus for the art design and style he clearly set out to show and run with. The muddled color palette was effective as well as the stark black and white, fullframe screen test footage of Kirshner. This old footage was spliced nicely and utilized as both flashback to her character and evidence to steer our leads through the story. It's unfortunate that De Palma felt the need to solve the case when the film wasn't leading us in that direction. Yes I'm sure the novel had that as the ending, however, once he realized how much effort he had put into the characters he should have not done them the injustice by wrapping the film up so neatly and quickly. Because of this, what was at first a nice period piece and moody telling of crime in Hollywood became a contrived murder mystery solved.",The Black Dahlia
94,Victor Field,"Scarlett Johansson looks as if she knows this is dull, confusing and pointless. And can you blame her?",3,26 September 2006,"As I write this, there's a rerun of ""Close To Home"" on TV; despite the fact that Jennifer Finnigan isn't a two-time Oscar winner like Hilary Swank or a BAFTA-winning international sex fantasy like Scarlett Johansson, any episode is much, much better than ""The Black Dahlia."" It shouldn't be that way.Brian DePalma and cameras remain a good combination, but even his wizardry can only give this sow's ear so much of a silk purse treatment; James Ellroy's novel must have been better than Josh Friedman's script makes it seem. Ostensibly based on the real-life unsolved 1947 murder of Elizabeth Short, the movie might have been better if it had stayed focused on said horrible crime - but from the off, when Josh Hartnett's endless voice-over kicks in over riot scenes, we're in more for a drama about a cop. And a not very interesting cop at that (Hartnett seems about as hard-edged as Hong Kong Phooey).A fuzziness in execution is this movie's downfall; the murder of Miss Short almost seems to take a back seat to a whole load of other things, and if our hero is supposed to be obsessed enough that he falls for a woman who looks like her it doesn't come off, in part because Hilary Swank doesn't look much like Mia Kirshner. At all. (That Kirshner, seen almost exclusively in film footage, delivers a more heartfelt performance than the caricatured Miss Swank doesn't help her case.) This also makes the implied ending of the movie fairly senseless - the main murder is solved in this movie (it may be a ""This comment may contain spoilers"" review, but I won't give away the killer's identity), but given that the real Black Dahlia lived a wild life and got the name because of her fondness for the colour black, and that a key character who winds up dead has a wild life and loves wearing black, if we're supposed to be thinking that she's the ""real"" Black Dahlia (the man who kills her is, by implication, never made to pay for his crime) it leaves a bad taste in the mouth. And renders the preceding two hours or so utterly pointless... or should that be, even more pointless, since we've been made privy to several utterly confusing plot points that come along without rhyme or reason, until the impression is left near the end that the makers realised they've got to tie together everything somehow, never mind if it doesn't make sense.To make matters worse, the movie manages to take story factors like lipstick lesbianism (and the genuine article), boxing cops, what used to be called ""stag"" films, riots, and gruesome murders and make the entire movie dull and uninvolving. The acting doesn't help for the most part (except for Aaron Eckhart, Mia ""girls on girls a specialty"" Kirshner and a nice cameo from Rose McGowan, most of the cast don't seem to be in the spirit - Scarlett in particular never looks at ease, though the script is more to blame), with Fiona Shaw particularly excruciating as Hilary's mum. And Mark Isham's score is reminiscent of Jerry Goldsmith's score for ""L.A. Confidential,"" but not as good.""The Black Dahlia"" is, paradoxically, both good to look at and a bad watch.",The Black Dahlia
95,hall895,Total letdown,4,20 May 2009,"The Black Dahlia murder is one of America's most famous unsolved crimes. The key word in the previous sentence being ""unsolved"". This film, as did the James Ellroy novel upon which it is based, sets out to ""solve"" the case. Unfortunately it does so in a completely ludicrous and unsatisfying way. The way the story as presented here ultimately plays out makes little to no sense. But if you can accept that this is a fictionalized account and not the real Dahlia story is it possible to enjoy the film? No, not really. This is a film which fails in so many ways.The film's biggest problem is that is it is a confusing mess, at times almost completely incoherent. The film is really not about the Dahlia at all as she does not appear until well into the proceedings and when we finally do meet her she is already quite dead. It's really the story of two detectives working the case. Aaron Eckhart and Josh Hartnett play the pair and while Eckhart is mostly fine Hartnett never convinces. His performance is stiff, wooden and painfully dull. Other characters flit about but it's really up to Eckhart and Hartnett to carry the film and only one of them is remotely up to the task. As the story slogs along you the viewer will get all kinds of information tossed your way. But there is plenty of information missing. Characters who will turn out to be important are woefully undeveloped. Half the time we have absolutely no idea what is motivating any of the characters to do anything. It all leads up to an untidy ending where the filmmakers have to spend an ungodly long time trying to explain what the heck was going on here. The whole thing is confusing and utterly disappointing. And in a movie which purports to be taking itself seriously the overly long, ludicrous finale contains one acting performance which can only be described as one of the hammiest of all time. It doesn't fit, it makes no sense. Come to think of it very little about this film makes any sense. I mean, they cast Hilary Swank in a key role as a character whose only reason for even being in the story is that she looks so much like the Dahlia. Except Swank looks absolutely nothing like the actress playing the Dahlia, Mia Kirshner. Seeing as she plays a character who is deceased from the get-go we only see Kirshner in contrived flashbacks, screen tests which show the Dahlia to be a sad yet charming, sympathetic character. Maybe someday someone will make a good movie that's actually about the Dahlia herself. This is not that movie. It's not about the Dahlia and it's certainly not any good.",The Black Dahlia
96,dglink,De Palma Falters with So-So Take on Film Noir,7,15 September 2006,"Dante Ferretti's set design beautifully evokes the 1940's; Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography enhances the period look; and the voice-over narration has been pulled from film-noir classics. While Brian De Palma's ""The Black Dahlia"" has much of the look and feel of Curtis Hanson's 1997 ""L.A. Confidential,"" that far superior film boasted better performances and a well-written screenplay. Although both films were based on James Ellroy novels and both had complicated, involved plots, the Hanson film came together with satisfying logic. Unfortunately, De Palma's movie is equally if not more complex and leaves a few threads dangling or at least badly frayed.Although loosely based on a famous Hollywood murder, ""The Black Dahlia"" spends more time than necessary in establishing the three-way partnership, if not ménage, between Josh Hartnett, Scarlett Johansson, and Aaron Eckhart. The leisurely pace allows viewers to ponder the last time that they saw a film with so many double letters in the stars' names. The trailer, which has played in theaters for weeks, was misleading, and the actual murder and resulting investigation do not begin until well into the film after we have witnessed boxing scenes between the police investigators, Hartnett and Eckhart, and some three-way flirtations that do little to advance the proceedings.The film only becomes interesting when the campy upper crust Linscott family enters. Hilary Swank as Madeleine Linscott is a deadly femme in black and as fatale as they come. Fiona Shaw as her mother shamelessly steals scenes and chews the banisters in her few minutes on screen, and John Kavanagh as Emmet Linscott adds to the family's quirky personality. An entire film could have been constructed around the Linscotts that would have been far more interesting than the Hartnett-Johansson-Eckhart romance. Scarlett has little to do but purse her luscious red lips and look desirable in tight blouses, which she does quite well. Josh is all squinty-eyed intensity and muscled charm, which he does quite well. Aaron tries for more, but goes a bit over the top; perhaps he would have been more comfortable playing a cousin of the Linscotts.Although ""The Black Dahlia"" is not the worst way to spend two hours, the film's pedigree would lead viewers to expect more. Only a week after the less-disappointing ""Hollywoodland,"" De Palma's take on another old Hollywood mystery should have been riveting. All of the essentials were there, except possibly a seasoned troop of stars, for another ""L.A. Confidential."" Unfortunately, what arrived was a nearly indecipherable mystery within a tedious love triangle that was wrapped in multi-million dollar production values.",The Black Dahlia

DePalma proved with his first significant film ""Sisters"" that he can handle extremely complex plots. So, I have no doubt the scuttlebutt about the 3 hour version is true. This version is missing so many key scenes, it's pathetic. It looks as if the multiple production companies involved could not agree on content, and this is the ""groupthink"" result, the most scatterbrained ""A"" picture since ""Sphere.""Oh well, the photography is great, Mia Kirshner is extremely effective, and Hillary Swank again proves why she is a world class actress.

98,cultfilmfan,The Black Dahlia,8,16 September 2006,"The Black Dahlia is based on the novel of the same name by James Ellroy. It takes place in the 1940's where two former boxers named Bucky and Lee become cops and are eventually assigned to a case involving a brutal murder of an aspiring actress named Elizabeth Short. The film shows the friendship between the two cops and how the case affects them (especially Lee) and how Bucky takes a shine to Lee's girl named Kay and how he also becomes involved with a suspect named Madeleine. The Black Dahlia has good direction, a good adapted screenplay, good performances by most of the cast, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design, good art direction, good set decoration and good costume design. In the 1940's there was a real murder case involving a young woman named Elizabeth Short who was found dead and mutilated and to this day her killer has never been found. Before seeing this film I thought it would be an actual account of the real life murder and investigation, but as the film went by I found out that this is just a fictionalized account of what author James Ellroy pictures happened back then and not what really happened. So, in other words this is not a based on a true story film and it is instead based on a book. That being said there were a lot of things I liked about this movie, but the film also had a lot of flaws as well. One complaint is that there are so many things going on in this movie it takes away from the Black Dahlia case which we assume the film will be about, but in reality it is only a side story in this film with other characters and story lines being focused on more. I thought a lot of the things going on in this film could have been left out and I would have just been glad if they had stuck with the Black Dahlia case. After awhile with all the different characters and things going on the film does tend to get a little confusing. I also found that some of this movie was really campy. Keep in mind I love offbeat films and I don't mind when certain films get campy, but when you take a serious movie like this and throw in camp it just doesn't suit the story and makes certain scenes feel really out of place. Two examples I can think of right off the top of my head are a passionate love making scene between the Bucky and Kay character on a kitchen table and Fiona Shaw who plays Madeleine's mother gives a truly embarrassing performance as the drunken mother. It was more laughable than serious and it almost makes you wonder if she was intoxicated while filming this. Personally, I would have also liked if this film stuck to a real story and followed the actual accounts of the Elizabeth Short murder, but perhaps seeing as it is unsolved there might not have been enough material to make a movie out of the real story. I'm not a screenwriter, so don't ask me. Reviewing the film as it stands though, I' am still giving it a very positive review because it was a very entertaining and compelling film and besides Fiona Shaw the acting is great, the film has style and looks great as well. Despite the silliness and the uneven parts of the film there is still an entertaining time to be had here and most of the time I was really enjoying this film, but had they fixed the few flaws I had with this it could have been a perfect movie instead of just a pretty good one. Still, I liked this movie a lot and if you don't care that this is just a fictionalized account of the story and there are some campy scenes then I suggest you see this movie for pure entertainment and as for style and atmosphere nobody does it better than director Brian De Palma.",The Black Dahlia
99,rainking_es,Quite a disappointment,5,16 March 2007,"All those that are interested in Hollywood history will know the case of the Black Dahlia, an aspiring actress that was murdered and dismembered in L.A. in the 40's. The case was never solved. So, the fact that De Palma would direct an adaptation of that story was nothing but good news. Besides, Scarlett Johansson was in the project... What could go wrong? Well, many things went wrong, especially a script that makes no sense at all, the character of Elisabeth Short (the black dahlia) gets in the foreground while we're shown a series of characters and parallel plots that are meaningless. What about the ending?? It's just hilarious.Despite all those big mistakes the movie is not boring, Johansson looks as beautiful as always, Hartnett is as expressionless as always, and that film-noir halo that De Palma gives to his movie is quite attractive.

100,RResende,The problem with thick plots and cinematic vision,6,13 July 2007,"I give Brian De Palma a high place in my list of worthy filmmakers. That means whatever he does, i will want to watch, even if it will eventually disappoint me. That is because he has a very personal and highly cinematic way to watch things and to tell stories, and he always starts from that So, i disagree to the opinion of many cinema buffs who dismiss De Palma for being a 'xerox' of several other filmmakers styles. I think he, yes, always denotes his influences, as clear as water, but in the end they all come filtered by his magnificent cinematic exploring way of seeing. And i emphasize on this last word, since with De Palma it's all about seeing... HOW, more than WHAT.Having said this, i see this one as a minor project. It doesn't mean it's not worth watching, but it's worse than an average De Palma project and miles from his highest moments. I've seen him do better with worse material. And i mean 'worse' or 'better' in relation to what suits better the director's style. The problem here seems to be the extreme complexity of the plot, which instead of getting simplified to bring out the visual complex movements he enjoys, gets more and more thick. De Palma needs the audience to be elucidated enough about the plot to enjoy his visual work (that because by default the average audience won't give up following the story, and place it always in front the more deep and specific cinematic elements).This will easily be correlated to Chinatown and LA Confidential and naturally assume itself as a ""neo noir"" or other strange name you may want to call it. Noir developed around characters who acted in the dark, driven by coincidence or fate, or both, anyway, always force superior to themselves who out-passed them. Here, placed above that traditional conception, we have the god camera, and one memorable shot, which i relate (there go the influences) with the initial shot of Welles' Touch of Evil. That shot happens in scene where the body of the wannabe actress is found and a gunshot takes place. This is space exploitation, performed by an eye which is allowed everything, sees alone what all characters summed see. This is the best cinematic moment of the film, more closed to what De Palma likes, and worth alone a good analysis.The other reference that came to my mind had to do with the folding in Sunset Boulevard. This was a fantastic example of how to construct a multi layered story, a masterpiece in screen writing; and it held a film inside a film, Gloria Swanson's youth project, directed by Stroheim, which was watched by their respective characters in Sunset Blvd. Here we don't have that symbolisms, nor the intention of that, but we have a film which drives the plot, and creates a very interesting character which never shows alive except for those pieces of celluloid (Mia Kirshner's character) and teaches us (aswell as our noir detective) stuff we want to know. Even the madness of Fiona Shaw's character (performed with special importance near a stairway, remember Sunst Bld?) reports to a correlation between the two pictures. i recently watched Antonioni's ""Profession: Reporter"" and i believe that in the Italian's picture, the ""film within the film"" had a similar effect to what de palma does here.This and an interesting inversion of roles that makes the ""femme fatale"" a brunette (Swank) instead of the common blond (which would be Johanson) are the good elements. The weak link between the thick plot and De Palma's will to search freely for stuff and move with more freedom (remember Blow Out) is the main flaw and its consequence is that the film almost never engages us, almost always fails to through at you elements that justify De Palma's beautiful shots.My evaluation: 3/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",The Black Dahlia
101,oneloveall,Misfire at noir still has a few interesting mistakes,4,28 December 2006,"This misguided stab at revitalizing the noir genre fails partly because it tries too hard. It also fails because it stars Josh Hartnett in it's lead role. Hartnett, making incremental improvements since his questionable debut years back, is still way too stiff to portray his crime fighting character with any sense of two-dimensionality, guiding the frequent and dull narration with his monotone slur. While he may have the look, this leading man still has a ways to go before he manifests some of that latent charisma more easily on-screen. Similarly, you get the feeling that the young cast providing the watered-down drama was mainly cast for name recognition, their slightly embarrassing interpretations on 1940's demeanor coming across more gimmicky then anything else. It's as if this period piece, adapted from the esteemed crime novelist James Ellroy (who also wrote L.A. Confidential) was made into film merely to have these young actors chew some classy scenery up in a very shallow and non-convincing manner. Unlike L.A., whose characters were life-like, the scenario plausible, and the atmosphere complemented the action, The Black Dahlia only wishes to evoke the same feelings through it's admirable set design, making the rest of this feel like a tedious exercise in exploiting this special genre of old detectives. Another massive flaw that contributes to this failure, although it may help carry some along, is the overreaching ways of it's script. The overvalued Brian De Palma, despite coming across primarily as a cold or unfeeling director, actually manages to spruce up the direction in ways that almost helped elevate the tiresome piece with many creative transitions and techniques employed to keep a steady pace. As the convoluted script twists and turns it's way around your apathetic heart however, it will come to pass that these creative flourishes are simply the frustrated attempts of a has-been director earnestly trying to distract his expectant viewers from the unintuitive, mishandled effort of a film that this turned out to be.",The Black Dahlia
102,jdkraus,"A sick, twisted, bloody mess!",2,6 January 2007,"Okay, I'm a buff on the murder of Elizabeth Short, known as the ""Black dahlia"". I was expecting a suspenseful thriller that had twists and turns to it. Yes, the film had that, but it was so, I mean so poorly done! To put it in clearer details, the film title was the wrong title. The ""Black Dahlia"" case only takes up twenty minutes of the entire film. The rest of it is: shoot-outs, boxing matches, intervening stories that made no sense or connection to the whole ""Black dahlia"" case.So, as it goes, the film takes place in the 1940s, told through the viewpoint of a detective named ""Bucky"" Bleichard (Josh Hartnett). he ends up being partners with a fellow rivalry Det. Blanchard (Aaron Eckart) and gets associated with his girlfriend Kay Lake (Scarlett Johansen). So for thirty minutes, it is about these trio of individuals. Again, there is no no sign of the black Dahlia. It seemed that the director chose to develop the characters early on, and not really get involved with the story at all. it becomes a bore fest, and I felt like I was watching a soap opera.After that, the body is finally found, and yet again the film bounces around between stories of these individuals, as well as an introduction of Madelaine Linscott (Hilary Swank), who claims to know the victim. So, the rest of the film bounces around between poor character development, non-sensed personal stories that aren't resolved, and with the topic floating in the air aimlessly the Black dahlia.Bottom line, there was no script. At the end of the film, the director tries to put everything together in one piece, but leaves so many plot holes that it is almost laughable. even worse, the case of the ""Black dahlia"" case is turned into a disgusting homosexual party of love and lust, leaving me yearning for a ""vomit bucket"". Basically, there is no plot, no script, no story whatsoever. I never was a huge De Palma fan, but this is by far the worst film of his I've seen.The only thing good of this film was the acting. Msot of it was wooden, but the two ""good"" cast members was Josh Hartnett, surprisingly, and Hilary Swank, who is known for being a decent actress. A funny thing about her in the film was that she played a very sex-driven prostitute. Why funny? Hilary Swank's past roles were never about lust and being good-looking (which she isn't), but nonetheless, plays the role well.it was a pitiful film.

103,Dan1863Sickles,"Stupendously Awful -- And Very, Very Funny",2,12 June 2014,"I first read THE BLACK DAHLIA by James Ellroy when I was a Marine stationed in Hawaii in 1988. I was familiar with the case, but this was the first really dark crime novel I'd ever read. I was amazed not only by Ellroy's encyclopedic knowledge of LAPD procedures, ranks, and culture, but by the feverish intensity of his writing and his corrosive, cynical understanding of America itself. Now, when LA CONFIDENTIAL came to the screen, I thought it would be horrible, but it was really very good. Not great, but very good. It was sanitized and an upbeat ending was tacked on, but the story still made sense and the performances were wonderful. And the dialog (""the evidence had his throat slit"") was completely true to Ellroy's spirit. THE BLACK DAHLIA was the stupendously awful film that I expected LA CONFIDENTIAL to be. What really jumps out at you in this BLACK DAHLIA movie is the obvious discomfort of the actors. Josh Hartnett puts a hat on his head like he's never seen one before. Scarlett Johanson poses casually with a cigarette holder in her hand but looks as if she's awkward, embarrassed and ill at ease with every single facet of her character. And she's not acting!Then there are the line readings -- the way each actor says the words. Scarlett is so wooden it's like she's never been in a movie before. Or like she doesn't speak English. ""Here's to my super cops!"" Said like a six year old girl when she's supposed to be cynical and sexy. Or how about ""Back slaps and paperwork, I know those boys."" Supposed to mean she knows how cops act, but sounds like she's mumbling an ancient spell in a language she doesn't know. The girl is both confused and comatose!When Josh Hartnett was just a boy he played a teen psychopath in O, and he was brilliant. Here he's totally callow and silly as a tough boxer cop. Never once does he come off as tough, street smart, or obsessed. Oh, and speaking of obsessed. When Aaron Eckhart plays Lee Blanchard as a loudmouthed bully, he's pretty convincing. But when Big Lee becomes ""obsessed"" with the Dahlia it turns into a Saturday Night Live sketch. Not just a good one, either. A classic. ""Bring me something about our girl!"" The late, great John Belushi himself couldn't have made that line any funnier. Just check out the ""intense"" look on Aaron's face!Oh, I do want to say that there are one or two good performances in this movie. Mia Kirshner in the flashback scenes really captures the sweetness and desperation of the real Betty Short. And Hillary Swank, somehow, someway, resurrects the true spirit of Ellroy's writing for her portrayal of Madeline. In a movie where everything else is all wrong, and laughably unconvincing, this Madeline is devastatingly authentic. Sultry, sensual, sophisticated, she steals every scene she's in, as alluring and authentic as her costars are wooden and false. This movie is stupendously awful -- and very, very funny.",The Black Dahlia

I recommend this, watch it with an open mind, its not perfect, but its a great movie. well done depalma, a good atmospheric thriller IMDb Rating: 5.5. My Rating: 9/10",The Black Dahlia
105,DonFishies,"Interesting and stylish, but disappointing overall",7,15 September 2006,"It has been almost ten years since Curtis Hanson delivered what was arguably the best picture of 1997, L.A. Confidential. That movie was great in almost every way (my key dislike was only in the performance of Kim Basinger, yet the Academy did not agree with me), and a big part of that was due to the source material from James Ellroy. And now comes The Black Dahlia, another one of Ellroy's books based on detectives in the 1940's, only revolving around a real event and having master filmmaker Brian De Palma at the helm. And unfortunately, the film comes with mixed results.After taking part in a boxing match which ends up giving a whole lot more power to the L.A.P.D., Dwight ""Bucky"" Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) and Leland ""Lee"" Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) are promoted to detectives and become partners. Shortly afterwards, they become entangled in the brutal murder of Elizabeth Short (Mia Kirshner), otherwise known as the titular Black Dahlia. What follows for them is a tale of corruption, greed and vengeance. It may not seem like much (not too mention the femme fatales of Scarlett Johansson and Hilary Swank), but the film really has a lot going on.And this is where a bit of the problems lie.Some of the events that occur over the course of the film, are just completely random and almost unexplainable. Hell, random subplots appear and disappear faster than they come up. When it really starts getting down to business, the movie becomes downright confusing, and the narrative does not let up for anyone to truly figure it all out. It gets especially bizarre in the final act, when almost nothing truly makes sense, and we just have to sit and just contend with what ends up happening. It makes it seem like they want the audience to sift through and determine what is relevant to the film and what is not, and only then can they truly grasp onto a full understanding. Even after watching the film a few hours ago, I still question some of the things that happened.I think one of the key reasons it does not make a whole whack of sense is the fact that it revolves around a real event. Last week's Hollywoodland had this same problem in that the filmmakers do not seem to have an idea of where to draw your attention. Do they want the focus on the murder itself, or do they want the focus on the cops investigating it? Adding in a few seemingly bizarre backstories does not help this either. They seem to strike gold when they focalize on what the murder and its impending investigation is doing to Bucky and Lee, but they do not spend enough time expressing it. They touch on it in passing, and instead, cut to either useless items, or completely random things. You can tell that there is some form of direction however, just not enough.Hartnett plays Bucky very smoothly, and does a very adequate job in his narration. He really lacks the zest to make his character interesting however, and has a really tough time trying to make the audience care about him. He just does not seem to have the hard-boiled cop schtick nailed down here, and only comes off as a little less than soft-boiled. Eckhart on the other hand, does have the zest and really shines through as Lee. His character goes through most of the changing during the film, and you can see the dramatic change of character as the film progresses. He just does not have nearly enough screen time to truly flesh him from being the strange and mysterious character.Johansson does well for herself as the girl stuck between the two partners, and only sparingly gets the opportunity to stretch out her enigmatic character. Swank on the other hand, feels completely useless in the scheme of things (until her character actually serves a purpose later in the film). Her disappear/reappearing Scottish accent is laughable, and her whole performance really begs the question of how she has managed to snag two Best Actress Oscars in less than ten years. Supporting work, especially from Mike Starr, Fiona Shaw and the flashback heavy Kirshner, are all on the mark and are fairly well done in their limited roles.Whereas there were problems with many other things, there are none with the sets, costumes and cinematography. This is 1940's Los Angeles, and it looks gorgeous. Every single minute detail seems to have been polished and amped up to the point of looking like it was filmed sixty years ago. It makes the film feel more realistic than it is, and makes the sheer ""coolness"" of the settings and characters stand right out. Although it may be advertised as being noir, it really is nowhere near as dark as it could have been. Yet, it still has enough packed into it to make this film visually astonishing.Another standout is the feel of it being a De Palma film. The camera angles, the slow motion, the violence, the sheer editing of it all (especially the worn black and white film clips of Kirshner as Short), just screams old school De Palma. From the start, even with its problems, the audience knows it is in the hands of a style master, and in that regard, the film is consistent and on the mark.But unfortunately, that same phrase cannot be used to describe the rest of the film. It is truly a mixed bag, but despite its confusing narrative, it is still interesting and stylish as hell. But I still cannot help but be disappointed overall. I guess I was just expecting a whole lot more.7/10.",The Black Dahlia
106,roedyg,boring,3,17 September 2016,"I saw a trailer for Black Dahlia. It suggested the movie would be too intense for most people. They lied.Most of the movie is watching Josh Hartnett and the other players smoke. Granted people in the 1940s idled there lives away chain smoking, but from a cinematic view, it is B O R I N G.Most of the first half of the movie seems to be about endless unconnected routine police work. In the second half, the complex chains of criminal motivation are explained. However, they are so intricate, they made no sense at all to me.Mr Hartnett is very handsome. They often show him shirtless, and even with his bare bum. However, the character he plays has all the charisma of a boiled turnip. Every once in a while, he explodes in anger. I could not understand what triggered him. Normally he is very phlegmatic.The two female leads I found repulsive. They are airheads. They do nothing with their lives. They try to manipulate men with Mae West crudity and vamping about in lingerie. They are just silly.Fiona Shaw, as the wealthy, conceited, tipsy, candid mother was a hoot.

107,mahmus,A total mess,3,20 March 2020,"This movie is gorgeously shot and De Palma's direction gives it a stylish touch... but man is this film a mess.Before the murder even happens, we spend like twenty minutes learning things about the main characters that never come into play again. It's a big waste of time and then, once the plot actually starts, we waste even more time with a terrible love triangle, if you can even call it that. It's kind of confusing. I think that's what it is but I might be wrong. Either way, it's not good. The plot is insanely convoluted and hard to follow, even by film noir standards.The performances are all over the place. Josh Hartnett is more wooden than ever, Scarlett Johansson is completely unremarkable, Hilary Swank is horribly miscast as a femme fatale and I don't even know what Aaron Eckhart is doing, but at least he gets some unintentional laughs.The best performance is Mia Kirshner as Elizabeth Short, the black dahlia herself. She appears in the form of old audition tapes and ufortunately she has vey little screentime.Unless you just wanna watch some admittedly creative shots, I can't really recommend this one.",The Black Dahlia
108,django-1,"outrageous, campy L.A. crime drama--visually striking",4,21 September 2006,"Maybe it's just me, but how could one NOT laugh at the over-the-top performances in such previous Brian De Palma films as SCARFACE and DRESSED TO KILL. This film, however, has to be one of De Palma's biggest misfires since BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES. First of all, forget even a semi-factual account of the real Black Dahlia killing. I have not read the Ellroy novel on which THE BLACK DAHLIA is based, so I can't comment on the adaptation. All I can say is that while this film features amazing 1940s production design and striking camera work, the script is one cliché after another and the dialogue is full of anachronisms. Is that supposed to be cute or ""ironic""? And the performances are so over-the-top that the audience laughed at a number of scenes. Even such usually subtle and nuanced performers as Aaron Eckhart and Hilary Swank chew the scenery and make wild grotesque faces into the camera as wildly as later Orson Welles or later Richard Burton or later Cameron Mitchell at their most extreme. As a director, Welles can get this to work in his films such as LADY FROM SHANGHAI or MISTER ARKADIN or TOUCH OF EVIL because despite the excess there is still a sense of the unknown and the terrifying. In BLACK DAHLIA, it's just hammy acting. If I wanted to see this kind of thing, I'd rent WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE. The plot is nonsensical and has no relation to the real world--and during the last fifteen minutes we keep getting new resolutions to the murder that are even more outlandish than the last one. If De Palma intends this as a send-up of the L.A. noir genre, then he achieved what he set out to do. THE BLACK DAHLIA looks good on a big screen, if you can forget the plot and dialogue. If you are thinking of renting this, watch CHINATOWN again...or better yet, watch HOLLYWOODLAND. How does De Palma get financing for these projects??? If you want to see a crime film where almost every character plays it like Glenn Anders in LADY FROM SHANGHAI (a little ""target practice""), this is your film. Whatever critic called this a ""shrieking camp-fest"" was totally on the mark.",The Black Dahlia
109,WriterDave,Noir to the Core and Nothing More,6,19 September 2006,"Brian De Palma's film version of James Ellroy's fictionalized take on the infamous Elizabeth Short murder is an old-fashioned entertaining mess of a movie. De Palma, a director who even when he's gone horribly wrong (as in ""Raising Cain"") still manages to direct every scene to within an inch of its life, only over-directs a few scenes here (the fabulous ""discovery of the body scene"" being the high point, and the ridiculous ""murder plot on the stairs"" being the low) which is shocking given his track record and the fact that every other aspect of the film (from the music score to the set design to the costumes) is saturated with noir conventions from the 1940's.As for the cast, the best thing that can be said about the leads (Josh Hartnet and Scarlet Johannson) is that they don't make total fools of themselves and aesthetically lend their good looks (especially Johannson) well to the sleek and fashionable time period. This is one of those movies where the supporting cast outshines the leads in many ways both good and bad. Hilary Swank does some decent over-acting, complete with an accent that would make Katherine Hepburn put a bullet though her head, as the femme fatale, while Fiona Shaw is laughably over-the-top and atrocious as her head-case mother. Rose McGowan in a bit-part is memorably bad, while the seductively demure Mia Kirshner as Elizabeth Short makes a strong case that she should get cast in bigger roles in better movies.The fatal flaw of ""Black Dahlia"" is that it never takes it true-story source seriously. It could've been a fascinating and psychologically rich look into the ramifications of becoming obsessed with an unsolvable mystery, but instead stays faithful to Ellroy's fictional take and fake conclusions that reside in the overly stylized world of classic film noir. Short's tragic demise is merely a subplot in the typical Ellroy universe of hard-nosed cops, wicked dames, cartoonish villains, crooked politicians, and decadent aristocrats. Sadly, the real murder of Elizabeth Short exists in a far darker and more real world. It is only in the lazily directed but fantastically acted ""screen-test"" scenes where Mia Kirshner allows us to get a brief flicker of something more profound. It is this dark world that the cool artifice of film noir has always so cavalierly glossed over. Noir's darkness hides the real dark. In this day and age, it doesn't make the viewer feel any better, only annoyed at at the old-school film maker's lack or self-awareness and artistic desire to shed some new light on an old tale.Conventional and mainstream, yet weird and off-putting in all the typical De Palma ways, ""The Black Dahlia"" is very entertaining (I laughed, I was grossed-out, I laughed some more, things got really creepy, and then I laughed again), but misses the mark for something deeper. Poor, poor Elizabeth Short. Both parts of her severed body were surely turning over in their grave while I enjoyed my popcorn.",The Black Dahlia
110,MichaelMargetis,"""Nothing stays buried forever. Nothing."" - Officer Dwight Bleichart (Josh Hartnett)",3,23 February 2007,"Well if there was any doubt in my mind 'The Black Dahlia' was bad movie, this settles it. 'The Black Dahlia' is perhaps one of the worst films of the year, not to mention one of the most boring. The movie starts out with a sort of comedic tongue n' cheek style about it. Hmm. Funny for a movie focusing on the most brutal murder in American history. It's like watching 'Johnny Dangerously', the cops and the girls all talk like cartoons with dialog so cheesy it will make you snicker in embarrassment. The film takes forever to get around to what it's supposed to be about, 'the black dahlia murder', and even then, it doesn't really go in-depth of the case that much. It's more of a character study of Josh Hartnett's character. That would be fine if the writing and the actor were good, but seeing that they both aren't anywhere near the ""good"" range, it's one rough little movie to sit through.The acting is pretty horrific in this film. Josh Hartnett staggers his way through the film trying to create a complex character but comes up with a character just about as meaty as one from a 'Mentos' commercial. He attempts to do drama, kind of like he did in 'Pearl Harbor', and fails miserably. Then there is Scarlett Johannson. Her character is completely unnecessary for the plot, and her performance in the film ranges somewhere between average and disappointing. Hilary Swank delivers what is without question the worst performance of her career, attempting to do a Scottish accent which she barely pulls off in the first half of the film, then for some reason completely loses in the second half of the film. It's hard for me to fathom how the same talented young actress who moved me emotionally with her roles in 'Boys Don't Cry' and 'Million Dollar Baby', could reduce me to snickers with her performance in this film. Finally rounding out the cast is Aaron Eckhart who delivers the best performance of the film. Not so fast, that's not really a compliment, because he staggers here too. Eckhart is great in some scenes, but in others he comes off as dry, and dare I say bleak? Kudos to Fiona Shaw, the actress who played Hilary Swank's mother, for making me laugh with her semi-comedic performance in a very out-of-character dinner sequence that really didn't belong in the movie.The absolute worst thing about this film is the writing. My god, it's awful! Like I previously mentioned in my introduction paragraph, the diologue is just plain cheesy. It's not suave or cool like it was intended to be, but just stupid and almost too embarrassing to listen to. Although I'm having such a fun time slamming this crappy movie, I have to give credit where credit is due. The way the film is shot, that is the cinematography, is quite neat. I like the style of the film, and Brian DePalma's directing isn't half bad (especially with an interestingly shot staircase scene), but still DePalma, director of such great films as 'The Untouchables' and 'Scarface,' is capable of much better work.All in all, I'm sad to say I can't recommend this movie at all. I can't even recommend it as a rental. It's a bad movie, period. It's slow, it's boring and had me yawning in the movie theater. It's an embarrassment to film-making, but some very bad feeling tells me there is going to be a lot of movies released this year that are actually worse than 'The Black Dahlia'. That scares me more than anything. Grade: D+ (screened at AMC Arizona Center 24, Phoenix, Arizona, 9/15/06)",The Black Dahlia
111,beresfordjd,A standard De Palma movie,4,16 March 2011,I have yet to see a De Palma movie I have enjoyed. They are all incredibly flawed. The Black Dahlia is the worst one I have seen of his. It looks great but the editing and writing is worse than appalling. Hilary Swank comes out of it like an actress who has never acted before and only Hartnett comes out of it with any credit. What possessed the studio to release such a mess? The score is awful and the whole thing hardly hangs together to make a coherent story.It is an excellent example of how not to make a film. That all that time and money should have gone to waste in this debacle when lots of other movie makers are struggling to get their work made and seen is a disgrace. Perhaps if the director had actually made a 40's film noir it would have worked better. He is obviously incapable of that leap.,The Black Dahlia

All I know is, I expected a movie about the short life (excuse pun) of Betty Short (Mia Kirshner who is one of my fave actresses ever) and her grisley death in Hollywood. All we get is a boring overlong bloated mess about 2 troubled cops. Boring dialogue, even more boring boxing match, and you don't even see anything of the title character until 25 mins. into the film. In short, (again with the pun) the life of Betty Short is hardly given more than a few scenes, reducing her to not much more than victim, and the emphasis on the ""seedy"" side of Hollywood is predictably provided with disturbing glee by director DePalma. The 4 main principal characters were completely UNinteresting, and the acting is pretty wooden overall. Sorry to say that other than Kirshner's scenes, along with some cool musical stuff by k.d. lang, this movie was as lackluster as a butterknife left in the dirt. Blech!",The Black Dahlia
115,Flagrant-Baronessa,Why don't we care about the core of the filmits story?,4,16 December 2006,"You may weed through several answers to find your favourite: for one, Brian De Palma does not care about it  so why should we? Then there is its truly terrible cast, Hartnetts' uncommitted narration lingering over every event, the director's preference of climaxes over continuity, the ostentatious bloated noir atmosphere and finally the fact that we know it cannot possibly live up to the majestic L.A. Confidential, a similar James Ellroy vehicle that received much acclaim in 1997, and rightly so.The Black Dahlia is nothing like the aforementioned, although it sees bouts of the same intrigue, lust, infidelity, murder and corruption within the police bureau in connection with a murder. This time the reality-based 'Black Dahlia' case is up for investigation, setting much at stake and embodying the unspeakable cruelty of Hollywood in offing its starlets, sometimes literally. As for the cast, replace the capable L.A. Confidential Guy Pearce with a stiff, fumbling Josh Hartnett and replace the quiet powerhouse Russell Crowe with a carelessly-smiley Aaron Eckhart. Finally, replace the effortlessly sexy Kim Basinger with a pouty voluptuous Scarlett Johansson, who regrettably cannot act worth a damn. None of these aesthetically-pleasing performers can act worth a damn, but as Johansson's character remarks about Eckhart in the beginning of the film: ""At least he looks good with his shirt off.""Yes, they all look gorgeous and there is a continuous reel of white pearls, soft glossy curls, voluptuous figures, pouty red lips, delicately-balanced cigarettes and and brooding cops in uniforms over 'whodunit'. The problem is that the whole experience feels unforgivably staged, with actors tipping over into over- or underacting and I truly cannot decide which is worse. Perhaps Hartnett and Johansson's collective crying scene speaks volumes on the puffy melodrama of the film, something that only merited raised eyebrows on my part, which soon turned into a hearty chuckle. The film is a long in-joke, and the cast are certainly in on it every step of the way.On the other side of the tapestry  that is, stepping away from the cast and story  De Palma does recreate the glossy 1940's noir with fairly deft strokes. In other words, he dutifully ticks off noir staples from the formula to heighten the already bloated tone: calm protagonist narration, femme fatales (a horsey Hilary Swank), cads, rats, dirty cops and they all blow smoke every chance they get, chew the fat, beat someone up, cheat on their spouse, and more. The Black Dahlia channels Wilder, Welles and Hitchcock but never elevates itself above 'showy pastiche' formula, perhaps mostly owing to the fact that De Palma is purposely mimicking something, staging a set, creating a mood, while the true 1940-1950's giants were original in their style and effortless in their execution. They were only doing what they thought worked at the time. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied that the production design is marvellous. De Palma navigates the picturesque Holluwood sets, the fancy gala parties, the seedy nightclubs and the uppercrust apartments hosting booze and sex  all accompanied by patient tracking shots from Hartnett's perspective to cement him in the protagonist slot (the poor kid needs help, what can we do?). The whole spectacle, although clearly modern in colour, seems to be seen through a dreamy soft-focus of sorts, certainly an intentional device in the film. Needless to say, De Palma shoves noir in our faces and it is the very last thing we want, even if it is remarkably eye-pleasing at the time.What we want is story, substance, tangible plot unfolding and character developments and regrettably we are offered next to nothing of the aforementioned. Granted, there are a few chills and thrills ( mostly of the cheap-shot variety (Hartnett throwing Johansson down on the kitchen table and...). In this way, we see a consistent subscription to 'climaxes over continuity' on the director's part where he has become so absorbed in the looks and atmosphere of the film that the plot suffers fatally and might never recover because of it. It never fully does, but toward the end De Palma at least pigeonholes some neat turns and issues plot twists by the bucketload to keep our interest while the pompous music score swells to heighten the action. This is lazy, lukewarm film-crafting at its most prominent.'The Black Dahlia' is one of the most vicisouly uninvolving films of 2006, and a kick up the arse to the noir genre (not in a good way, as in ""Batman Begins"" was a kick-up-the-arse to the dead-and-buried Batman franchise). Its most prominent tool is the atmosphere, which the cast and set go to great lengths to establish throughout the film, which suffers onslaughts of some oozy, swelly noir moments because of it.The rest, however, is a regrettable and showy failure. 4 out of 10",The Black Dahlia
116,pfgpowell-1,Utterly baffling but oddly entertaining,6,18 December 2013,"Years ago a spoof soap launched each episode with a rundown of the story so far, concluding with 'Confused? You soon will be'. Brian de Palma's The Black Dahlia could come with the same warning. But curiously it is eminently watchable, even though I didn't and still don't have a clue as to what was going on. Based on the James Elroy novel which was itself based on a real murder which remains unsolved, it is obvious that for de Palma his film is a tribute to the film noir of the Forties and early Fifties, and I must admit it is a handsome film to watch. I especially liked the jazz score. Where de Palma comes unstuck is with the story he tells, or rather doesn't tell. Muddled wouldn't even begin to describe it. The relationship of the two LA detectives involved in investigating the murder inexplicably begins in a boxing ring where the two are pitched against each other for the entertainment of their bosses and peers. Why is not at all clear and it doesn't help that that is also how Elroy begins his novel. After that it is a trawl, confusing but intriguing through the demi- monde of post-war LA before we reach a baffling denouement of which the highlight is Britain's very own Fiona Shaw hamming it up as though her life depended on it. As I said I was clueless throughout as to what was going on, but at least de Palma kept me interested and entertained. Give it a whirl and if you can enlighten me, drop me a line.

Their partnership begins to fall apart as Lee becomes obsessive, and Bucky uncovers corruption and conspiracy at every turn. Based on the James Ellroy novel, this is a very heavily fictionalized account of the real life murder that remains unsolved to this day.A week after seeing Hollywoodland (and loving it), I decided to see The Black Dahlia because I enjoy that type of movie. I like film noir, I like true crime (even though only about 10 or 15 percent of this is true), I like period pieces, and I like Brian De Palma. Unfortunately, The Black Dahlia didn't exactly blow me away. It wasn't really dark enough to be considered film noir, and Josh Hartnett's narration was choppy and unnecessary. Brian De Palma's direction was as good as always, but unfortunately it didn't carry the film. The movie itself seemed too long, it had a few scenes that weren't really necessary, and when the movie ends, it just ends, with nothing tied up or explained. They try to make the murder look like a big conspiracy, but they don't really tie everything together well enough to make it cool.The acting was pretty good. Josh Hartnett and Aaron Eckhart were good as Bucky and Lee, and Scarlett Johansson was good as Lee's troubled girlfriend.Overall, the movie is worth one viewing on DVD, but that's about it.

122,richard_sleboe,Polished period porn,4,3 March 2008,"I went to see this with great expectations and was disappointed. It's a prototypical case of period porn, parading props and costumes the way x-rated movies revel in genitalia. Period pornography is primarily a British phenomenon (compare pretty much everything Helena Bonham Carter or Keira Knightley have appeared in), but the American 1940s apparently lend themselves to museum-style movie-making just as well. As a consequence, the production designer, Dante Ferretti, is the only true star of the movie, especially since the acting is uneventful and the script is a mess. Unless you are already familiar with the real-life murder case the movie is based on, you won't be able to make sense of the intricate plot. Rather than tell the story, the script merely alludes to it and leaves it to the audience to pick up the pieces. Aaron Eckhart delivers a solid performance in the part of a cop with a covered-up criminal record. Scarlett Johannsen doesn't look too shabby in the era's dramatic make-up and dress, like another exquisite piece of furniture. Josh Hartnett and Hilary Swank don't know what they're doing. Hilary Swank looks particularly lost and keeps slipping in and out of her laughable fake English accent. Mia Kirschner's part, the title role, is too small to leave a lasting impression. High-class cinematography and fine original score, neither of which can save a sleek-looking, but essentially mediocre movie. I suggest you check out David Fincher's ""Zodiac"" instead. It's in many ways a similar, but much much better movie. Fincher was originally lined up to direct ""The Black Dahlia"". Pity.",The Black Dahlia

Scarrlett Johanson has blown it. I thought her dreamy, airy, breathless performance in Lost in Translation (and similar in Ghost World) was her 'acting', but no, it's her 'being'. She is hopeless in this.Plot? What plot? It's more complex than a 1966 Château Margeuax.Hilary Swank dies (I won't tell you if she does plot-wise as I would'nt want to give away the punchline) . No Oscar nomination number three from this exercise.Way too long, way too awfully acted, hamfistedly directed and a score that is , to say the least, enthusiastic.Go see it, it's hilarious.",The Black Dahlia

125,mOVIemAN56,Could have been so much better... SO MUCH BETTER,5,18 September 2006,"I had much anticipation to go view The Black Dahlia, I had been awaiting it for several weeks. The trailer drew me in and led me to believe it would be about the grisly murder so much advertised. This part actually turns out to be a back drop for a different story. A story that should have been left out.The film follows two detectives - Bucky Bleichert and Lee Blanchard - who are assigned to investigate criminal activities in rough parts of LA. Soon they are confronted with past events involving Lee and his wife Kay. While this occurs, the body of 'The Black Dahlia' is found near a house they are investigating. Now they are on the case.But instead of the film just dealing with the events of the Dahlia murder, they decide to put it in the back drop and instead focus on Lee and Kay's story which turns out to be a total bore. The story becomes so chopped up and confusing that eventually you stop understanding what is going on. I had little hope for Josh Hartnett as a lead but he pleasantly surprised me. He delivers a great performance in a so-so movie. Scarlett Johansonn got to my nerves after a while. Aaron Eckhart gave his usual good performance for the time he is in the film. Capping off the acting is Hilary Swank who seemed to be a waste in the film even though she is something great to look at. The main problem with The Black Dahlia is that it jumps around too much and there is way to much sex filmed. I counted 3 of them in the last half hour of the film. It is just a waste of time and a filler for lack of story. How I see it, the first half of the film is good with good action and a thought out story, the last half is chopped up way to much and dances around like a jester.2 1/2/ 5 Stars",The Black Dahlia
126,Med-Jasta,Enjoyable but nothing classic.,7,4 November 2021,"The movie is well done and you'll get your money's worth. The actors are good. And the story is good and unconventional. But the problem is with the information. Important information is kind of crammed into these small scenes making it hard to follow and remember everybody's name and what their deal is. I guess making it convoluted at times. And it's a little slow. It's not bad, it could just use some fine tuning.A lot of the problems are from the book. Which isn't the best either. But they did a good adaptation, if I remember right.The relationship between the three leads is different and interesting. And I love De Palma's style because it's usually used to great effect. Like before the shoot out/they find the body when there's that long shot that sets up the geography. You know something is going to happen then. Or the Hartnett POV shot when he meets the girlfriends family.It's a good dark thriller that doesn't ""cop out"" in the end or anything. The story is dark and stays there and the good guy figures it out but he doesn't really win. And then at the end we see that he'll always be tortured by this. Ending on a very dark note.For some reason I always thought Hartnett was a bad actor. When he's not, he's just subtle. I guess my teenage mind couldn't pick up on the subtly. He's not the only actor I've come around on for this reason.The one thing I remembered from this that I never forgot was the end scene when you finally see the ""cut smile."" I remember that really jumping out at me in the theaters. And I had waited the whole movie to see it. Thinking that they were cutting around it for the ratings. I hadn't seen the real pictures yet. They movie is really worth it just for the end just to learn the effectiveness of it all.I hated this in the theaters. I don't know why hate. Maybe because I was super into Da Palma then and expected more? But since I was 19 I figured it was worth a rewatch and I'm glad I did.",The Black Dahlia
127,fil-nik09,Hmmm...,5,17 March 2016,"I feel relieved now that after taking a quick look at other reviews I see that I am not alone in the fact that I did not understand ANYTHING what was going on in the film! So... First of all, I did not understand whether the killed girl ( but there were many more killed - if I understood) was very famous in Hollywood or just some obscure wannabe star. I think I heard the both facts in the film !? And why and how is she important to the story of the film? Her connection to the main characters is very vague - to say the least! And plus, where were those black & white footage of her found? I can go on with the questions...but there are no answers. Maybe the film was conceived to be half told... but as this is not quite a mystery film ( to me) I do not thing that lingering questions add to the appeal of the film.Josh and Scarlett are both really beautiful / handsome in the film. They even kinda look as if they were really from the 50's ! Hilary is good too. Actually I think that those names kept me watching the film as the film itself is rather non-eventual and on the verge of being boring ...Five from me as I liked the brownish color of the film and for the costumes.

But a decent ending saves the film, despite the flaws.The biggest flaw is Josh Hartnett. He has ruined every film he has been in and he has never given a good performance. Apparently he is trying to be a neo-noir actor because he has been cast in ""Lucky Number Slevin"" and ""Wicker Park,"" but he is a lousy actor and cannot portray a tough guy.The first hour and a half of ""The Black Dahlia"" is trying to be an ""L.A.

Scarlett Johansson is wasted in a lost puppy role with nothing to do put look pretty.It is not until the last half hour that ""The Black Dahlia"" starts to get it's own identity. It's at that point where it stops being an ""L.A. Confidential"" imitation and starts being a Brian De Palma film.To be sure, the ending is over the top, campy, and improbable.

129,barberoux,Confused,6,22 September 2006,"Okay, ""The Black Dahlia"" has problems. Still it wasn't a bad movie I gave it a 6. The problems were mostly in the last reel with the ridiculous, overly complicated, almost campy ending. The truth revealed about the brutal murder of the Black Dahlia seemed tacked on and made up on the spot. I wasn't convinced by the story or the portrayals but was a bit disappointed at the lack of work put into coming up with a satisfying ending. The ending contained one of those long expositions where the whole complicated story is explained by one of the bad guys. These scenes just prove that the movie was a failure at telling the story. If a character has to tell you what happened what is the use of the movie medium to begin with. They took this brutal murder and used it as an excuse to tell the story of these two cops and their relationships with a couple of hot babes. The sensational murder was almost an ""oh and by the way"" event even in the way it was filmed. The story of the two cops was even disjointed where events weren't fully explained but they just happened to further the movie. It was all very confusing. I thought they had too many story lines going on and none of them were examined sufficiently to be interesting. The movie did look nice. The cinematography was very good and many scenes were interestingly and expertly setup and executed. I enjoyed the actors, generally. Josh Hartnett was much better than he was in that stupid Slevin movie. Aaron Eckhart was hammy and Scarlett Johansson was, again, disappointing. She is such a babe with that flawless skin, those plump lips and, of course, those boobs but her acting in this movie and in ""Scoop"" was wooden and mechanical. I think she is taking roles that are not suited for her. I enjoyed her in ""Lost in Translation"" and loved ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" but she doesn't impress me lately. I think she is going for the Hollywood glamour girl roles but seems too much like a little girl playing dress up. Hilary Swank was good. She was very believable and can act far, far better than Ms. Johansson. Ms Swank was sexual in the movie; Ms Johansson tried to look the part but didn't convince me. Mia Kirshner was good as the victim. She convincingly portrayed the sadness and vulnerability of a not too talented actress using her wiles to get ahead and being exploited by those in power. Fiona Shaw was good as the crazy wife and portrayed the character as written well even though the writing was poor. William Finley was nicely creepy and many others played their roles competently. The movie is worth seeing even though it is flawed. It is not a murder mystery, though a murder is committed and it is a mystery, nor is it a cop buddy movie even though there are cop buddies in the movie nor is it a love story. There isn't much love presented just lots of lust. It was a confused mishmash. Nicely filmed and directed but confusing.",The Black Dahlia

A Surprising good performance is played by Harry Potter star Fiona Shaw who plays Madeline Lincott's crazy mother Ramona who have had an involvement in Elizabeth's murder. Scarlett Johnassen gives a good performance as Lee's girlfriend Kay Lake, but I will admit that Hillary Swank was underused as Madeline Lincott but does the best with the material given.",The Black Dahlia
131,ExpendableMan,Flawed LA Confidential companion piece,6,19 April 2007,"If Brian De Palma's Los Angeles crime saga succeeds in one particular area, it is in evoking the feel of a period. 1940s ""Hollywoodland"" is recreated in an evocative manner, all the way from glittering mansions filled with priceless artifacts down to grubby dives filled with unsavoury customers and drug deals. It breathes like the setting for a perfect noir, the glamour of the movie industry offset by the shabby underbelly propping it up. Shame then, that it doesn't quite fulfill its promise. Not that The Black Dahlia is a bad film. Far from it. It's a pitch black crime movie with the sort of atmosphere you'd expect to find in an abattoir and has a powerful performance from leading man Josh Hartnett as a morally dubious police officer. No, the factor that lets it down isn't even its own fault, it lies with the problem that most people who come to see it, will have already seen the far superior LA Confidential. Should you not have seen that movie, you'll find plenty to enjoy in this one, but for the rest of us, the aura is undeniably that of a less successful younger brother. If you decide to watch them both in one night, my suggestion is to play this one first.Much like Curtis Hanson's 1997 effort, The Black Dahlia is based on a work by writer James ""Hooray For The LAPD"" Ellroy. The story involves the true life unsolved-murder of Betty Short, a young actress who met a grisly demise in 1946. The repercussions of this murder sent shock-waves through the police community, not least on the lives of Detectives Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) and 'Bucky' Bleichert (Hartnett), and Blanchard's girlfriend Kay Lake (Scarlett Johansson). As a result, The Black Dahlia is as much a character study as a murder mystery, with Hartnett in particular being granted a nigh-on unhealthy amount of screen time. As Bleichert, he gets the most lovingly crafted persona; a cop who makes a few morally dubious choices (accepting sex in exchange for withholding evidence being the most obvious example) but who is ultimately a decent man. Good as Hartnett may be though, he's definitely not a magnetic presence like Russell Crowe's bull-headed Wendell White from LA Confidential.Hartnett aside, the rest of the cast portray their roles confidently, but suffer somewhat from less fully fledged characterisations and at times, it does seem as though a lot has been left on the editing room floor in order to spare the running time. In the case of Aaron Eckhart's Blanchard, it couldn't be more obvious as the detective moves from being a cool-headed, professional man to a disintegrating obsessive in next to no time at all. Johansson meanwhile has little to do but look sultry and seductive, waiting in the wings for cues and not doing much. Hilary Swank's femme fatale on the other hand is perhaps the weakest, the novel's scheming sex-on-legs black heart transferring to the screen as a spoilt bit of posh totty who looks like a young Sigourney Weaver and speaks with a silly British accent.Undeniably then, a weaker movie to what has gone before but The Black Dahlia still has much to commend it. The complex twists and turns of the source novel have been honed and streamlined and while befuddled head scratching is still inevitable, it isn't anywhere near as migraine inducing as that found in the book. De Palma has also pulled out his bag of tricks when it comes to delivering some thrilling set pieces: a boxing match between the two detectives is a pulse pounding introduction and a slow motion plummet down a stairwell ends in a head splattering crowd pleaser. This aside, the biggest attraction is the scheming Emmett family, a collective of eccentrics, intellectuals and drunks who you sometimes wish had been given an entire movie of their own, especially the hilarious matriarch.A film of two halves then. The plot may be somewhat confusing at times as sub plots fizzle out with no closure only to be dragged back up again later on but nevertheless makes for interesting viewing. Hartnett puts in a fine performance and De Palma has certainly not lost any of his flair for stylised violence. However, it's cursed to remain in the shadow of it's bigger, better brother.",The Black Dahlia
132,marcus_stokes2000,Black Dahlia Will Entrance You,9,9 October 2006,"*Black SPOILERS* Two boxers-turned-cops, Bucky (Josh Hartnett) and Lee (Aaron Eckhart), nicknamed 'Mr. Ice' and 'Mr. Fire', end up becoming friends and having a sexless menage à trois with Lee's girlfriend Katy (Scarlett Johansson). But their idyll is broken when the two men begin investigating the brutal murder of a young woman, Elizabeth Ann Short (Mia Kirshner). The case quickly becomes an obsession for Lee, and Bucky finds himself in the vortex which this case unearths, because it quickly becomes clear that a famous family is involved in the murder, and as he begins sleeping with the older daughter (Hillary Swank), the darkest dark lady this side of Barbara Stanwyck, he finds out more and more secrets about that viper's nest...Brian DePalma has certainly not lost his touch; 'Black Dahlia' (the nickname given by the medias to Betty Short, probably inspired by 'The Blue Dahlia', the classic Alan Ladd movie), a movie based on the James Ellroy book about a real unsolved 1947 murder case, manages to bring back the feel of the old Noir movies, the world they depicted, where even prostitutes looked slick, and where good men could do bad things and not be hated for that, and all women were seductress, either out of love or out of interest, so much that even if this film is in colour, the cinematography suggests the grandeur of those old black and white movies.The actors are all in top shape, but the secondary characters are more interesting than the two leads (I mean Hartnett and Scarlett 'she's everywhere you turn' Johannson). The best are unarguably Aaron Eckhart, who puts a fair share of his heart in the irruent Lee, Rose McGowan, who manages to be appealingly translucent, a good actress and sexy as all getout even while wearing a weird Elizabeth-Taylor-Cleopathra-like Tiara and having only one scene, and Mia Kirshner, who breaks your heart in the scenes where recordings of her are showed, like a 1947 Laura Palmer.Don't miss this Dahlia, her perfume is amazing.Black Dahlia: 9/10",The Black Dahlia
133,bababear,The Funniest Movie of the Year........,1,30 September 2006,"........however, it wasn't supposed to be funny. But I had the feeling that if I saw this with a large audience (especially somewhere like Alamo Draft House where beer is served during the movie) people would be laughing so hard they'd make themselves sick.About 2/3 of the way through I made a stunning realization: I'm smarter than the people who made this movie. I'm way smarter than they are. I was smarter than they are when I was in junior high school.Everything in the story is propelled by incredible coincidence. Characters just happen to know or be related to other characters who did various things decades ago, as if Los Angeles were a village of about 150 people. Characters come out of nowhere, as is if to save time the director only filmed the even numbered pages of the script. Almost every sentence could so start with ""It just so happens that..."" or ""And when I looked up who should I see but..."" Josh Harnett provides a voice-over commentary to try to paste events together. Unfortunately, it just takes the film closer to self parody.You can spot this as a train wreck in the making here on the IMDb. Go to Complete Cast and Crew and you'll see that there are sixteen producers credited. At the beginning of the film itself there are logo after logo for the incredible five production entities that created this. No wonder it's an incoherent mess.It's sad to see such talented actors go to waste. And THE BLACK DAHLIA has a wonderful musical score and some of the best cinematography you could ever hope to see.There's a scene where Harnett and Ms. Swank are cuddling after an intimate evening. She's filling him in about her family history and he interrupts her, telling her she doesn't need to tell him this. I nudged my wife and told her, ""Yes, she does have to- it's exposition.""Maybe MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATRE will be back on the air in time for us to see their take on this movie. It would be a classic.",The Black Dahlia
134,alfiefamily,DePalma Tries To Kill A Genre,3,22 September 2007,"Think of the words ""Film Noir"", and what comes to mind? Obviously, ""Touch of Evil"", ""The Big Sleep"", ""Maltese Falcon"", ""Chinatown"". And what did all of these films have in common? An intelligent director, who can take the story and the actors, and make them work together to make the story interesting and keep it moving, in order to pull the audience along. With ""The Black Dahlia"", Brian DePalma almost single-handedly makes a mockery of this wonderful genre, and thereby tries to kill it. This is a horrible mess of a movie.There is really nothing to say about the story, because it is a meandering mess. For all of those people that have felt that ""The Big Sleep"" is confusing and doesn't make sense, well, in the immortal words of Al Jolson, ""You ain't seen nothing, yet"". This boring yawn, I mean yarn, seems to go on forever. Characters are introduced, then dropped. Some are flashed on the screen, and then show up as major plot points in the final reel. In the last twenty minutes, there are at least three places where you will beg for the movie to end, but it just continues on to the next boring semi-conclusion. I must say that at one point of the movie when Fiona Shaw (who is absolutely awful) blows her brains out, all I could think was, ""Why didn't I do that twenty minutes ago?""The acting is, too be kind, intolerable. Josh Hartnett gives another in a continuing series of performances that make you wish for a return of Elisha Cook, Jr.. His acting is more wooden than any cigar store Indian statue. Aaron Eckhart gives new definition to the phrase ""over the top"". The best thing that can be said about Scarlett Johansson's performance is that in the scenes she shares with Hartnett and Eckhart, she comes off the best. And Hilary Swank may have a great ass, but she is not the femme fatale type.This movie is so wrong, on so many levels, with every noir cliché added just to presumably show how much of a film buff DePalma is. Please, avoid this film. Go out and watch ""Touch of Evil"" again.3 of 10",The Black Dahlia
135,ScottDMenzel,"""The Black Dahlia"" is one of this year's biggest disappointments.",4,15 September 2006,"""The Black Dahlia"" is based on actual events which occurred in Hollywood, California during the 1940s. The film follows two cops Bucky Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) and Lee Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) who are investigating the horrific murder of Elizabeth Short. As Bucky continues to investigate the case, he soon finds out that the people closest to him may in some way be connected to one of Hollywood's most notorious unsolved mysteries.To be honest, I was expecting ""The Black Dahlia"" to be one of my favorite films of the year. Unfortunately, the entire film was a major let down. The film started off at a decent pace, the acting in the beginning was rather solid, and lastly the direction by Brian De Palma was fantastic and really brought the 1940's back to life. But then about half way through, ""The Black Dahlia"" seemed to lose a lot of steam, became very hard to follow, and overloaded with twists. At this point, the acting also began to seem over the top and everyone involved just seemed to be forcing the material to the point where I literally just busted out laughing.The story of ""The Black Dahlia"" is definitely an interesting one however the film tries too hard to be edgy and ultimately has one to many twists which makes the film seem overly long. There were some scenes which felt ultimately pointless and were used more as time filler than anything else. I also had a big problem with the fact that De Palma was trying to say Hilary Swank looked like Mia Kirshner because in my eyes the two don't look anything alike. The acting in this film felt very forced even with many academy award winners and nominees being apart of the film. Josh Hartnett, who I normally can't stand, actually did the best job in the entire film. His character Bucky at least felt realistic and wasn't as forced like the other characters. My biggest disappointments as far as acting goes were the performances by Scarlett Johansson and Hilary Swank because both actresses are extremely talented and this film did not show of their talent at all. All of Johansson's lines felt forced and at times just seemed extremely unbelievable. Swank's overall character was not a good one for her, she didn't play a sexy temptress character well and this made the performance seem very poorly acted. Aaron Eckhart did a decent job with what little he had. Also, I have to say that Fiona Shaw should definitely win an award for giving such a horrid and over the top performance as Ramona Linscott. Every moment she was on screen was just painfully awful and laughably bad. The film was directed by Brian De Palma who did an excellent job with capturing the 1940's as I previously stated however when it came to judging the acting in the film it almost seemed like he put his personal assistant in charge of that. It seemed like he worried so much about how beautiful the film looked rather than how well the overall movie was. The film was written by Josh Friedman who honestly hasn't had much experience writing films since he only wrote two previous screenplays one being the bad Keanu Reeves movie ""Chain Reaction"" and the other being ""War of the Worlds"" but does the latter really count since that movie didn't really have any substance at all? The script for ""the Black Dahlia"" seemed like it wanted too much from a single film and maybe if Friedman didn't try to make the film about twists rather than about an actual story it would have been better. Also if some of the smaller casting was better and if the movie about 25 minutes shorter, we may have had a better film. In conclusion, I really wanted to like ""The Black Dahlia"" however about twenty minutes before it ended I just gave up on it and wanted it to end. The film was wonderfully shot, had so many talented people involved, and an interesting story yet for some reason, the majority film was completely forgettable once you leave the theater. How De Palma let this film fail on so many levels is beyond me since this the man directed many great films in the past including ""The Untouchables."" To say I was disappointed with ""The Black Dahlia"" is really an understatement since I was hoping to include this film on my top 10 at the end of the year. Sadly not even De Palma's wonderful directing nor can Scarlett's beauty save this sucker.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""The Black Dahlia"" is a 4/10. It's a promising film that ultimately doesn't live up to its excellent and promising marketing campaign.",The Black Dahlia

It tries too hard to copy CHINATOWN, L.A CONFIDENTIAL, THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE and several other film noir titles but fails. Out of four stars, I told my wife this one works hard to earn two.There are many problems in my opinion: 1) The story starts and spends too much time on the two male leads and there boxing history. What that has to do with the Dahlia murder story in nothing. 2) After the murder the film is named for the male lead spends more time jumping from one woman's bed to another, not going into the office, not perusing the case. 3) There are scenes from THE MAN WHO LAUGHS (1928) shown and no one ever points out how odd it was to see this great classic ""silent"" film in the 1940's after WWII and when the clips are shown, there is no evidence that it is a silent film? 4) There are too many characters, plot twist confusing motivations and loose ends.In conclusion, I would say skip it and see the films this one steals from (mentioned above) and the best of the film noir genre, OUT OF THE PAST & THE KILLERS!",The Black Dahlia
137,David_Frames,Half way there,6,18 September 2006,"Brian DePalma is in thrall to 40's Hollywood but errs on the side of self-plagiarism in his return to the American mainstream following a European sabbatical. Heralded as a return to form by many following a particularly baron period  presumably by those who haven't seen much of his 70's output, this adaptation of James Ellroy's pulp novel, itself inspired by a notorious unsolved murder, proves worthy as a tribute to the kind of classic picture the director would have studied at film school but unlike Polankski's seminal revival Chinatown, to which is draws unfavourable comparisons, not least in the Goldsmithesque score and the perverse underbelly of its plot, it fails as a complete work in it's own right. This is because though fluent in the grammar of the genre, DePalma's prose is light and lacks that all important subtext which provided the shading for so many darker, better noirs. So he made the inferior film but at least DePalma, unlike Polanksi, can return from Europe. Aesthetically, the film measures up to a genre fans' expectations. Its re-creative style is excellent, period browns and washed our colours complimented by an enthusiasts' eye for details including period evocations such as wipes, soft focus close-ups of the alluring female leads and a brooding voice over from Josh Hartnett  Noir conventions that profanity and nudity aside, provide you with a film that could be 60 years old. Unfortunately DePalma seems content with such indulgence, forsaking the more deft characterisation and punchy dialogue of the Dahlia's predecessor's for something that steers an uncertain course between homage and pastiche and tips toward the latter more often than you'd like.The film's problems are manifest in the poverty of new ideas that hangs in the background like a silhouetted Peter Lorre. Watching the movie reminds you of better, more coherent work, not least from DePalma himself, whose trademark use of slow motion, POV shots, jump cutting and deep focus close-up, are familiar devices to liven up otherwise slow scenes. That isn't to say that The Black Dahlia doesn't occasionally evoke a sense of foreboding and the kind of obfuscation from a more unpleasant truth that characterises the best of the genre, but more often than not, particularly in a laden second act, the viewer misses the more assured, better defined strokes of Polanksi's 1974 tribute or for that matter the brilliant reinvention of the recent Brick, which was fresh and seductive rather than merely derivative. Having said that it was Polanski's well defined strokes that put him in French exile so...Ever so often the material is enlivened with a flourish that seems transplanted from a better film  Scarlett Johansen's seductress branded with a 'BD' from her former pimp Bobby Dewitt, a suggestion that in thematic terms she's the real Black Dahlia, the object of two men's obsession and scenes of the Dahlia herself, 'screen testing' for her big break, narrated off camera by DePalma as director; a tidy example of mise-en-abyme in which he casts himself as a product of the old studio system  a good joke given his reverence for old masters from another age. This unfortunately is as deep as it gets. DePalma's success has lain in his ability to combine technical bravado with an appreciation for genre but having chosen film noir in which the writing is as important as the atmosphere, he's come unstuck  content to make a B picture while it's 40's forebears have long since advanced a division.",The Black Dahlia
138,ilovedolby,Style without restraint,7,18 September 2006,"""The Black Dahlia"" is a hybrid among noir films. It is as if the film exists in a plain of the perverse world of ""Sin City"" combined with a realistic image of Los Angeles in the late 1940s, as in ""L.A. Confidential."" Although the red hearings that inhabit this world are depraved in one form or another, as are most of the villains in the Noir Genre, there is a point where ""The Black Dahlia,"" based on James Elroy's novel and on a true event, becomes absurdour suspension of disbelief has to carry us to accept the conclusion. However, in this highly-stylized world that director Brian De Palma has created, there is a devilish fascination where I found intrigue in its decadence. The story involves that of two cops, Officer Dwight ""Bucky"" Bleichert, played by Josh Hartnett and Sergeant Leland ""Lee"" Blanchard, portrayed by Aaron Eckhart, boxing buddies who work a beat tracking down local L.A. hoods. On one of their potential sting operations, they happen upon the mutilated body of an actress, Elizabeth Short (mutilated is an understatementshe has been cut in half and several of her organs have been removed). As the case unfolds, Blanchard becomes obsessed and it manages to take over his life. What's more, the clues to solve this bizarre puzzle lead Bleichert down the path to the young and sultry Madeleine Linscott (Hilary Swank), a bisexual woman who once slept with Short because they the two looked alike. As the world of the normal begins to combine with that of the eccentric, the details of the Ms. Short's murder enter a realm that neither detective could have explained. When a person hears the words Film-Noir, naturally the greats come to mind like ""The Maltese Falcon,"" and ""Chinatown."" One of the most recent and best examples of Film-Noir was ""L.A. Confidential,"" which although considered as part of Film-Noir, is actually an almost realistic take on the genre. The events depicted actually had characters who had been real people, like the crime-boss Mickey Cohen and his henchman, Johnny Stompanato. ""The Black Dahlia"" wants to be like ""L.A. Confidential,"" and it is not simply because both stories were written by James Elroy and share a key character. Rather, ""The Black Dahlia's"" story exists in a realistic setting, where much sensationalized movie-techniques happen. The style of director De Palma is fantastic as he uses sweeping continuous shots that crane over buildings and follow parallel events without the use of cross-cutting. The use of deep-focus to portray events directly in the foreground and background of a scene keep the audience on the edge of their seats. Also, cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond often places the camera right in front of the actors so when they deliver their dialogue, it is as if they are speaking directly to the audience and to another character in the scene. This technique gives the audience a claustrophobic feel; a technique used by Hitchcock in several films. Yet, for all these grand technical wonders, the film lacks subtlety. The great sweeping shots, the use of deep focus, even melodramatic performances all mask an almost failure of the director to properly put the film together. It cannot be denied that this movie could have been extremely realistic and shockingly menacing; perhaps on par with ""The Silence of the Lambs."" After all, the story of the Elizabeth Short murder is not only sensationalit is unsolved to this day. De Palma had the chance to create an original film that borrowed on a noir setting. Instead, he went for broke and settled for noir setting alone. I have been trying to rationalize in my mind that the film's error was in the script and not the direction (I often find that directors take all the heat for the failures of other aspects of a filmlet's face it, more often than not they have to work with what they are given). I wanted to blame the adaptation by Josh Friedman. However, after pondering it for some time, I suppose a more restrained approach to the ending in terms of its final produced setup could have made it seem more realistic. Regardless of the films missteps, I ultimately like the picture. I am a sucker for Film-Noir and was in the right mood when I saw this film to be easy-going on it. ""The Black Dahlia"" comes off like the younger brother to a better film, ""L.A. Confidential."" But this is one of those situations where those who compare both films might say ""Gee, why can't you be more like your older brother!""",The Black Dahlia

We expected a movie about the Black Dahlia but this is more along the lines of the 2 detectives following the case. I don't care about them. However, it wasn't a bad movie, it was pretty good in an off sense. It should have been born Elizabeth Short. What made the 2 stars is William Finley. Though he's in the movie for what a brief 2 seconds? Its always good to see him, even if at this time he is almost dead.",The Black Dahlia
140,iago-6,Bad News Folks: You May Have to Think,9,18 September 2006,"It's a little disappointing to read the reviews to this film. True, it is quite complex (I didn't figure it out until four hours after the movie ended), and will probably take two viewings to make sense of it all, but I think it is a very good film that rewards such attention. The opening hour is fairly static and lays out a massive amount of information. I was getting a little antsy, feeling like the film was floundering, but, for me at least, the second hour just became more, and more, and more exciting. I had to pee for the final hour and could never find a safe time to leave my seat! In retrospect you need all that info in the first half in order to start reaping rewards during the second half, but I fear that most people have given up by that time.It's unfortunate that people routinely confuse a character that is supposed to be very unemotional with a blank and lifeless performance. I didn't like Josh Harnett until I saw Wicker Park, in which I came to appreciate how he can go from reserved to emotional wreck in 0.3 seconds. He is playing an emotionally reserved character, folks! His nickname is ""Mr. Ice,"" right? And I'm afraid that the Eckhart character's story won't come into focus until you've sorted the entire movie out, which may be hours after the movie has ended. Here's my interpretation of the Lee story, including massive spoilers:Spoilers! Lee was involved in crooked business with the Linscott family, Hilary Swank's family. This is why he knew that the criminal was going to be in the brothel at the beginning. When Harnett threw him the matchbook and he saw Linscott's name, he knew that their investigation into the Black Dahlia murder could expose his own wrongdoing and ruin him. This is why he gets so obsessed with solving the case, and also cannot speak to anyone about why he's so obsessed. Spoilers end!Anyway, this is a very well put-together movie that does require a great deal of attention. It's unfortunate that modern audiences seem to need everything explained to them and are unwilling to do any thinking whatsoever, but it is fortunate that De Palma continues to ignore them and make movies as intelligent as he wants to make them.---- Hey, if I haven't annoyed you, visit my website devoted (mostly) to bad and cheesy movies: Cinema de Merde.

But Not as Good as I Would Have Liked!,7,11 February 2007,"I thought that this movie focused too much on the small romantic and sexual parts of the story then it did on the Black Dahlia. Who cares about the detective's love life? That's not whats important here.This movie should have been more centered on the investigation into this woman's death. It also should have shown more of her life before she died. When I rented this from my library I thought I was renting a real TRUE CRIME based movie. I will tell you now that I was disappointed to find out that that was not the case.Although, there were some good things about this movie. Such as, the investigation scenes, costumes, production, and directing. The photography was great too.",The Black Dahlia
142,bob-rutzel,Disjointed,4,13 January 2007,"Two police detectives work on a murder of an aspiring actress. She is so cut up she is barely recognizable, and wait until you find out why she was murdered.The setting for this movie is in the 1940s, and the beginning of this was easy to follow. Two detectives and partners (Harnett and Eckhart) who were at one time pro boxers, put on a boxing exhibition to sway voters to approve more police funds. That was easy. The rest isn't. Then comes the murder of a young actress and they are assigned to the case. For most of the movie only one detective seems to be working on that case and the other on something else. The movie really didn't show them as working as partners too much, a little yes. Maybe this is where it fell apart for me. Dwight or Bucky (Hartnett) is more concerned about someone about to be released from prison and who is obsessed with Lee's (Eckhart) girlfriend Kay (Johansson); meanwhile Lee continues to work on the murder.The last 20-minutes of the movie all is revealed and the clues now found were shown to us a while back at 90-miles per hour so we didn't have a chance to put anything together. Who knew they were clues? For me this was a disjointed effort to by the director to confuse and mislead the audience and maybe himself in the process. And, what was most distracting was that everyone smoked and everyone blew smoke into everyone else. That's part of the problem with movies set in the 1940s, the smoke into everyone's eyes and no one complains. But, that was the way it was back then.Other things were also distracting. The audio for the dialogue wasn't all that good on the DVD and I had to back up several times and sometimes that didn't help too much. And, oh, yes, seems they bolstered or artificially enhanced Johansson's head lights. Believe it or not they were part of the story, sort of.One of the most disturbing things, for me, was S. Johansson's role. It was almost non-existent. She is of the caliber of actress that needs to play parts that have more impact than this movie gave her. Hey, why do you think I rented this movie? Huh? The acting performances by everyone else were fine. It was the story that needed coherence.There are several lesbian scenes and they are not titillating, but they are there and recognized as such.",The Black Dahlia
143,guilfisher-1,Not as bad as others have said,6,26 January 2007,"I didn't find this film so objectionable as other critics. I think Brian De Palma managed to give it the look of the times and made it a film of the 40s. A nice look to the era. I felt the weakness was in the casting of the women in the film. Both Hilary Swank, an actress I just don't get, was God-awful. She is not a sex symbol. Not that attractive and, to this viewer, highly over rated as an actress. I did not like her in her Oscar winning roles, but then, the Academy Awards are such a fake anyway. She should have stuck with Chad Lowe. She might have picked up some good acting hints from him. Saw him in off Bway play several years back and he was dynamite. As to Scarlett Johansson, she should wipe off all the make up, stop trying to act like a glamor queen and act her age. She should grow up a lot more. There are other dames that got what she doesn't. However, the guys did fairly well. Josh Hartnett did a fine job and played the role quite realistic, even though his leading ladies didn't give him any ammunition to work with. His best scenes were with his partner of the LAPD played well by Aaron Eckhart. Together they gave the film it's suspense and drama.",The Black Dahlia

The real story and the source material by James Ellroy are extraordinary and this could have been the foundation for a cinematic masterpiece. So the expectations were pretty high of many critics. Brian De Palma's movie, however, has many weak spots and is no masterpiece by far and this would explain its partly inferior reviews. So after reading all those reviews, my personal expectations had become very low. That's probably the reason why I was able to enjoy it very much. It contains some mastery scenes, for example the camera move over the rooftop, during a shooting, to a mother, who finds the body of Betty Short. Or the best scene of the movie in a staircase. On the other hand I didn't like the beginning and I also didn't like the resolution, which I felt to be similar to a bad TV movie.

145,skoyles,It has to be seen twice!,8,7 October 2008,"""The Black Dahlia"" is a triumph of uncomfortable film making. DePalma takes a first class cast, sets them in one of the most perfect re-creations of post-War Los Angeles/Hollywoodland. It is a very dark film based on Ellroy's dark novel and in many ways parallels another motion picture based on an Ellroy book, ""LA Confidential"". I respect both movies and yet I must be in a tiny minority for everyone praises ""LA Confidential"" while ""The Black Dahlia"" is excoriated on every possible front: subtle acting is condemned as flat, insane acting as over the top, accurate touches as too many cigarettes, and so forth. That it is not a simple mystery such as ""Charlie Chan in Panama"" is no reason to condemn this complex character study of degenerate insanity. It is not a pretty film but neither is it ugly for ugliness' sake. The cinematography is beautiful, the lighting superb and the excessively complex storytelling only reveals itself on a second viewing. Quite an amazing triumph but utterly ""uncuddly"". I can understand one not liking this film (though the hero with all his flaws is likable)but I cannot understand the near universal condemnation of it. One reviewer suggested that only film noir fanatics would like ""The Black Dahlia"" and he may be right. I dislike some of the most famous noir films, e.g. ""The Killers"") and yet admire ""The Black Dahlia"" and will watch it again, perhaps in a year's time, confident that I will find yet more aspects to admire.",The Black Dahlia

147,gws-2,An unserious but beautiful and exciting noir thriller,7,4 July 2009,"Let's get this out of the way first: I love Brian De Palma's stuff. The guy is the ultimate trickster, who has not the slightest compunction about jerking his viewers' legs. Nevertheless, his films are beautiful and The Black Dahlia is no exception. Better yet, a first class cast really gets its teeth into a picture that is an exercise in noir storytelling. Anybody who goes into this movie with the idea that it will tell a serious story is doomed to disappointment. If you recognize that the confused and confusing plot is nothing more than another De Palma joke at our expense expense and that the real mission of the film is to pay tribute to the wonderful noir stories about L.A. in the '40s of Raymond Chandler and Dashiel Hammett, you are in for a treat -- at least if you are as big a fan of those dark and exciting stories as I am.Don't let De Palma's joke get the better of you. Forget the plot and watch The Black Dahlia from the point of view of most of us when we saw the far more successful and approachable, Sin City. The Black Dahlia is never as overtly funny as Sin City but, it seems to me, it does a lot of the same sort of things. Recommended, 7 out of 10",The Black Dahlia
148,Craig_McPherson,Watch the story of Elizabeth Short get mangled worse than her corpse,3,16 September 2006,"In 1947 at the age of 22, Elizabeth Short, an aspiring actress, was found murdered in a vacant lot in Los Angeles. Her body had been severely mutilated and cut in half at the waist. The case was nicknamed ""The Black Dahlia"" by newspaper reporters seeking to capitalize on the then-popular movie ""The Blue Dahlia"" which was enjoying its theatre run at the time.The case remains unsolved, although at its peak police suspects included Norman Chandler, the Publisher of the Los Angeles Times, and folksinger Woody Guthrie. More recently true crime authors have gone so far as to speculate that Orson Wells was the killer.Enter novelist James Ellroy (L.A. Confidential) and Director Brian De Palma (The Untouchables, Scarface, Dressed to Kill), who had signed on to bring Ellroy's novel based on the case to the big screen in a film-noir homage to movies like Double Indemnity. Anyone could be forgiven for thinking that with the talents of these two behind the camera, and the on screen presence of Scarlett Johansson, Josh Hartnett, Aaron Eckhart and Hillary Swank, The Black Dahlia would be a delightfully dark fedora-filled pot boiler that would be entertaining from beginning to end.Sadly, such is not the case. Instead what gets served up is a muddled, confusing and at times hysterically over-acted movie that seems to treat the actual Dahlia case as mere window dressing for other, less engrossing story lines. There are no less that three plots to this film, all of them seemingly competing against the Dahlia murder mystery for top billing. In fact, at times I got the impression that Ellroy's script would rather delve into anything else, other than the actual murder, as if looking for any excuse not to get in sync with the film's title.It's too bad because among this film's few highlights are the screen test clips featuring a glimpse into the soul of Elizabeth (Betty) Short, played mesmerizingly by the stunning Mia Kirshner.I couldn't help but feel that if Ellroy and De Palma had jettisoned some of the extraneous competing plots, and instead placed their focus on telling more of Short's back story rather than the confused gumshoe narrative that they went with, the end result would have been a vastly superior film.",The Black Dahlia
149,teh_mode,Flawed but Stylish,6,21 September 2006,"Does anyone actually remember when Brian De Palma used to be great? It is hard to believe this is the same guy that shocked everyone with Scarface (1983), introduced the world to Robert De Niro in Greetings (1968), or made hit after hit after hit in the mid seventies to the late eighties. What really kick-started the decline was Bonfire Of The Vanities (1990), that abomination of a film that didn't really know what it was meant to say, nor how to say it. His latest fairytale - a modern film-noir has the obvious flourishes that one can expect from the man that brought us The Untouchables: stylish outfits, flashy characters, a shamelessly overbearing score and at least one chase scene.Dwight ""Bucky"" Bleichert (Hartnett) and Lee Blanchard (Eckhart) are two former-boxer cops, assigned to investigate the murder of Elizabeth Short, a once aspiring actress brutally murdered at the door step of Hollywoodland. As the investigation grows hotter, both find themselves in a world of deceit and corruption.The Black Dahlia gets off to a promising enough start. We get to see both Bucky and Blanchard wage war in an old fashioned boxing match, to which Bucky ends up with two front teeth missing. We are also introduced to the ultra-glam girlfriend of Blanchard - Kay Lake (Johansson), who immediately develops a subtle attraction to the young ""Mr. Ice"" Bucky. Everything is shot very nicely, as De Palma captures that period feel of Los Angeles but in an intriguingly dirty light. When we first meet Hilary Swank's character of Madeleine Linscott she sweeps across the screen, eating up the camera effortlessly. She talks like Katherine Hepburn, and looks like a teenage Cruella Deville. Maybe after two Oscars, and numerous worthy projects Swank feels she has the right to just coast in this one. I won't argue with her.In all fairness to The Black Dahlia, it isn't exactly ""boring"". It has enough style and empty headed incident to make it an interesting film, but it is way too flawed. The movie is too long, momentum gained during the film's opening narrative is roundly drained way before the credits start to role. At the heart of this mystery we have a three way relationship between the two hotshot cops and Blanchard's wife, which moves in such an obvious path it isn't really worth bothering with. At times it is hard to work out the tone of this film: far too many scenes are laden with rumbustious melodrama, not least from Linscott's mother Ramona (Fiona Shaw), who munches at the scenery as if she were playing Hamlet in Pantomime. She is so over-the-top the giggles in the audience began to drown out the dialogue. There were more laughs in this film than practically anything else which, for a film-noir, is not the most enticing quality. And then there is Hollywood's current golden muse Scarlett Johansson. Leading actresses are going through somewhat of a rough patch at the moment. In the nineties there were a string of leading ladies who could open a movie based on their name: Jodie Foster, Sandra Bullock, Sharon Stone and Demi Moore. As of present Hollywood bosses are attempting to push Johansson into that golden bracket, but as of yet she hasn't produced a marquee film. The Island flopped, Match Point seemed to fly by everyone's head and The Black Dahlia has received at best mixed reviews. We know what she is capable of, by her fine turn in Lost In Translation (2004). As of yet I remain unconvinced. And then we have De Palma himself. A man it seems, forever caught in a bind, ever since his career halted in the 1990s. His latest project is not a bad film, and is certainly watchable and at times perfectly interesting. But as modern film-noir goes this has none of the substance, nor the intrigue of Curtis Hanson's previous Ellroy adaptation LA Confidential (1998). What we have is a film that wants to look as dirty as Chinatown but be as loud as Scarface. A dastardly unceremonious combination that will probably leave most viewers predominantly unsatisfied, despite its stylish flourishes.",The Black Dahlia
150,Noirdame79,A new appreciation but this film could have been so much better!,7,8 May 2020,"I've come to appreciate this film more now than I initially did back in 2007 when I first saw it on DVD. Does it have issues? Undoubtedly. From what I understand, the original cut ran nearly three hours and James Ellroy (author of the novel) praised it but Brian De Palma, probably under studio pressure, cut the film down to two hours. This explains why the plot is convoluted, but I loved the recreation of the 1940s period, the cinematography, the music, set design, etc.Mark Isham's score is wonderful and atmospheric, and the actors did a decent job all things considered. Scarlett Johansson looks like a woman of the era and Mia Kirshner is heartbreaking and poignant in her (all too brief) screen time. Rose McGowan makes the most of her one scene as an aspiring starlet. Josh Hartnett handled the lead role better than expected and Aaron Eckart is always a welcome presence. Johansson's Kay Lake, while flawed, represents the safe, warm and gentle while Hilary Swank's Madeline Linscott is the dark, dangerous, and untrustworthy. I did have an issue, however, in that Swank and Kirshner's characters are supposed to resemble each other when the two actresses don't look remotely alike.Makes you wonder what might have been; here's hoping the original director's cut will be released.",The Black Dahlia
151,jed-estes,This is a nice return for De Palma.,3,18 September 2006,"I found this movie hard to follow, but then again so was Mission Impossible, Brian De Palma's 1996 effort. But after multiple viewings I have found that that film is solid and had a great story. This is why I intend to buy the Black Dahlia when it is released because I hope to find that I missed things and the film holds up better than it seemed. That said the film seems to take for granted it's time period. It seems to think that everyone watching it will have a vast knowledge of the 40's era and be able to understand the lingo. That was not the case for me. While the actors were talking I had trouble dissecting what they were saying and the conclusions they came to. I found the ending was a little hard to swallow, but I can live with and there is a nice jolt in the sequence that reminds me of the Carrie ending. Josh Hartnet gave a career performance in this. They only other work by him I have ever liked is his turn in Sin City. Hilliary Swank finally looked good for a change and not like some horse faced freak that every one loves just because she is in a film. I still think she needs to improve as an actress and did not deserve her two academy awards. Aaron Eckhart does stellar as always and I loved his voice in this as he was the only one who seemed to make sense. The main reason to see this is because it has the return of one of the greatest actors of our time to the screen after a decade. William Finnley. I love everything by him, especially, especially, 1974's The Phantom of the Paridise where he plays Winslo Leech AKA The Phantom. That film has inspired me to make films and I love his acting. I'm sad to see that De Palma has let his talents waste having not worked with this master of acting for almost thirty years. In this De Palma makes a come back from the disasters that were Femme Fetal, Mission to Mars, and Snake Eyes. This feels more like one of his medium works. It's more Body Double good than Scarface good. At any rate see this and show support for an ageing master.",The Black Dahlia
152,cwade22,Sadly disappointing. Very little of Elizabeth Short!,4,30 March 2018,"This movie had potential. The first time I saw it, randomly mid 2009, when I first moved to Los Angeles. It aired late at night, I was alone and thought it was a fictional movie. It was. But I decided to search the title of the movie. I ended up seeing pictures of Elizabeth Short, and I couldn't sleep for days! My first apartment was near a street called Norton Avenue! Elizabeth Short's body was dumped at the same street, albeit about 8 miles from my apartment. I imagined her crawling towards me in the dark. Ever since, I have been obsessed with this unsolved case. It's Trafic that Due to lack of clear evidence, there won't be any great, Honest depictions of Elizabeth Short's life/story. This movie was fiction, based off of Ellroy's Fictional book. Again, the best way to do a movie about Elizabeth Short's case is either very well thought out speculation of possible events, going by her actual suspects, or With real life Evidence that concludes the case. Neither was done. But if you read Larry Harnisch's review, it makes sense, especially stating VERY LITTLE OF BETH WAS IN THE FILM! If you ever researched this case, you really want answers. It hooks you in, and this film is a constant reminder that it didn't do enough. David Fincher(the Zodiac director) was set to direct this film, but stated he couldn't do it justice. Maybe lack of evidence. I'd rather he directed the film because if you watched Zodiac, he was detailed with all evidence. That case is practically solved, not officially, but definitely zeroes in on one person. The Black dahlia case has multiple suspects. No, Hodel didn't kill Her. It would've been nice to see a film dive into Walter Bayley and Leslie Dillon as suspects. Another aspect that ruins the movie, THE CASTING. The cast didn't seem to fit in their characters. I respect Mia Kirshner because somebody gave her Ellroy's book saying She resembled Beth, 10 years before filming the movie, so I don't mind her trying. But makeup was bad. Her hair looked nothing like beth's. Hillary swank didn't make sense. It's fictional movie, but casting didn't sit right with me. My friend is the nephew of the cinematographer of this film. That's nice. Zsigmond was nominated for doing this film's cinematography. It is a great aspect of the film. Some say the ONLY redeeming aspect of the film. In the film, there was a real moment that showed the Real morgue picture of Elizabeth Short, after the coroner sewed her mouth together. If you know the picture, you'll recognize it. But the mannequin they used in the film didn't even resemble the wounds Beth received. Everything seemed lazy about this film, except cinematography. As somebody who has spent HOURS researching this case, I wanted to see more of Elizabeth Short, alive. More about the torture sequence, which took Days! Only lasted few minutes in the film. This movie had potential, but it failed to do Elizabeth Short justice. Maybe one day, I'll have $1billion and will write a solid script about This black dahlia case, and make a great film that answers questions about what possibly happened to Beth in those last hours of Her life.",The Black Dahlia

I don't need to understand what's going on if, at least, I'm entertained. Look at The Big Sleep for instance. There will never be another ""Chinatown"" I'm afraid, regardless of what Mr Ellroy thinks. The one element that sees you through this inconsequential mess is Josh Harnett's face. At times he looks as confused as I did and just as annoyed. Who can blame him? Hilary Swank, what was she doing? She looked like Vampyra's sister, the boring one. What a catastrophic piece of casting. And Fiona Shaw? If the film had been all like her performance the flick could have had a chance at the campiest ""noire"" ever put on film ever.

But Bryan De Palma's raw over the top style is always something I can appreciate. And when he does it to perform vintage noir as in THE BLACK DAHLIA now, the intensity and artistic value of it is something very good that I wonder if it compensates to the deviation from the novel.You gotta love the exquisite mobile framing that's a trademark of DePalma. He totally understands the biomechanics of camera movement, blocking and et cetera.Excellent cast all throughout. The best player here to me, is Academy Award winner Hilary Swank in her seductive role. But much better than that, the greatest thing to look at in here is Scarlett Johansson, with the priggish allure of a woman from the era, she has the looks, dressed up and down, the hair and she plays her role well too.Although the movie is more than somber noir, it is extremely dark in tone, it ends on with a faint glimmer of optimism, and perhaps potential redemption and forgiveness amidst that darkness.7/10",The Black Dahlia
155,MovieZoo,"Black Dahlia, a black hole in the movie making universe",4,15 September 2006,"Brace yourself for some real truth. As you noticed on IMDb, this movie was advertised as ""Crime / Drama / Mystery / Thriller"". The trailer makes the movie look the same. Unfortunately, if you go to this movie with that in mind, you may and should be disappointed. When I see the genre described as it was, I want to see just that. Oh, you can add comic relief, maybe good music, some reasonable horror and nostalgia, but do not do what was done to The Black Dahlia.They obviously didn't intend to make this a serious movie, but rather it was a cheap attempt to imitate a Film Noir sometimes, a TV mystery sometimes and then other times I don't think they knew what they actually wanted to do.When I am sucked into a movie that I believe is going to be a mystery, I want to be able to enjoy the movie throughout and get involved in the mystery. In this case, the viewer has to spend far too much time trying to figure out what the movie is trying to do. Just give me the mystery that the movie is about. No one needs to make the movie-making process a mystery.For those of you who are going just to see Scarlett Johansson, I have to say I am very disappointed in her. Her acting needs a lot of improvement or she needs to find movies that embrace her sensuality. Yeah, she is sexy in this movie, too, but her voice does not fit her actions and her acting is puzzling, not mysterious. I want the Scarlett I knew from ""Lost In Translation"" and ""American Rhapsody"" at least she could act and her voice fit her character. Other main characters were just as puzzling, however. And honestly, the best and most interesting characters were treated somewhat like extras, though one of those ""extras"" was by far the best actress in the movie.You can call this an imitation Film Noir Graphic Novel that should have taken a more serious approach to even those genres.I gave it a 4 out of 10 out of generosity.",The Black Dahlia
156,bjones,Throwback to the 1940's,8,18 September 2006,"The Black Dahlia I have to first say I almost didn't go see the film because of negative reviews from some people. I'm glad I decided to see for myself because I did enjoy the film. The primary criticisms seen to be that the last 20 minutes or so of the film were unrealistic or implausible. One highly rated critic said it was confusing and he had trouble understanding characters mentioned at the end, even making incorrect statements like some had never been mentioned in the story before. To those critics I'd feel compelled to counsel, PAY ATTENTION! I didn't find any of things to be true. I have read of a lot of real life crimes that were equally surreal, I've even known a serial killer personally.What I did find was a great modern interpretation of the fine Film Noir of the 40's. I think ""The Maltese Falcon"" had a similar ending and this film is just as entertaining. That noir look is hard to pull off in color but the director here, Brian De Palma, did it quite well. It's not too surprising to find that talent in the man who gave us such films as ""Scarface"", ""The Untouchables"", ""Wise Guys"", ""Dressed to Kill"" and ""Carlito's Way"". I think his work here was equally superb considering the material he had to work with, an old, very well-known, unsolved murder.The casting was good but not perfect to my taste, but then, films rarely are. I did enjoy the performances of Scarlett Johansson as the suicide blonde, Hilary Swank as a bisexual socialite, Fiona Shaw as her quite mad mother, Josh Hartnett as the do-gooder cop, Aaron Eckhart as his crooked partner and John Kavanagh as Swank's father. Even Mia Kirshner as the title character pulled of the part required of her (many murder mystery victims don't get as many scenes either). Rose McGowan, too, had a nice little part.As the main leads, Johansson and Hartnett made a fine pair, lusting after each other and finally succumbing to each other's charms. But the real scene stealer was KD Lang, singing in that incredible voice of hers while wearing a man's tuxedo and top hat and surrounded by a dancing chorus of scantily clad, osculating lesbians. Second in that category is the mad housewife/mother played to the hilt by Ms. Shaw. She was quite suitably creepy.Perhaps as good as the rest of the movie was the technical aspects, especially cinematography (Vilmos Zsigmond), costumes, art direction and lighting. It was a very well done period piece - save a few minor errors like shoe soles too thick, a wrong knife for the period and the wrong electrical wire for the period. But those minor things were forgivable as the rest of it was wonderful to watch. I loved the look of the film a lot.",The Black Dahlia
157,alexdeleonfilm,"Second rate De Palma ~~ Too long, too klunky, and too confusing",5,13 December 2016,"Brian De Palma's Black Dahlia 2006 Venice openerBrian De Palma's eagerly anticipated ""BLACK DAHLIA"", which officially opened the 63rd Venice Film Festival was screened for the press this morning with the screening immediately followed by a packed house press conference. Principal actors, Josh Harnett, Scarlett Johansson, Aaron Eckhart, and Mia Kirshner (who plays the gruesomely murdered Elizabeth Short of the title) were present as well as director De Palma and writer James Ellroy, on whose novel regarding the famous unsolved L.A. murder case the film is based. Ms. Johansson looked much better in person than she did in the film, (is this the next Lana Turner?), handsome Josh (he was in ""Pearl Harbor"" a few seasons back) looked younger in person than in the film, Eckhart, with a scruffy beard and shirt open at the neck, looked every bit as tough as the hard-boiled detective he plays in the film, and Mia Kirshner looked rather demure in contrast to the 'come hither' cheapie porno actress and ""Black Dahlia"" murder victim she so effectively and winsomely portrays in a relatively limited role. Scarlett Jo (how long will it be before the tabloids start calling her that?) --seemed very much at ease before the large Italian press gathering, looking and expressing herself (y'know ) rather more like just a very good-looking young gal from L.A., than the superstar diva she is rapidly becoming. In any case this is a very good-looking young lady, not at all hard on the eyes, although in the film, De Palma somehow managed to make her look almost doughty or borderline Plain Jane. The press screening ended with a scattering of polite clip-claps – not exactly what you would call an enthusiastic reception. On the plus side, the look of the film is gorgeous – only to be expected as lensed by ace Hungarian DOP Vilmos Zsigmond, and the period reconstruction -- costumes, hats, cars, hairdos – even down to minor details like a newspaper report almost at the edge of the frame, on the death in a plane crash of opera star Grace Moore – is, if not 100% perfect, certainly one of the best for its period I've seen in many a moon. The personalities of the characters as created by the various actors, all in very good form – even Hillary Swank, whom I normally can't stand – are quite engaging and believable – all, that is, except for Scarlett Johansson, who comes off phony and stagey -- quite the opposite of her total convincingness as the femme fatale of Woody Allen's ""Match Point"" last year. Whether this is the result of insensitive direction on the part of De Palma or the demands of a role too complex for the as-yet not fully experienced actress, or a combination of the two factors – is hard to say, but one thing is sure – this is not going to go down as one of the highlights of Ms. Johansson's film career. On the other hand, both pugilistic detectives, ""Fire and Ice"", respectively -- Hartnett and Aaron Eckhart – are both likely to come out of this as highly sought after screen properties. Hartnett for his good looks and vulnerability, Eckhart for his gritty neo-Gene Hackmanism. Mia Kirshner is also particularly touching in her few scenes, especially the one in which she does a take on Vivien Leigh in GWTW, almost bringing that long-gone star back to life for a few seconds of screen magic. However – humph-humph – much as I was longing to love this film because I love the period and the L.A. of the period it was just too long, too klunky, and too confusing – too much work, for most audiences I think, to figure out just what the hell is going on, and why! I found it hard even to fathom the unquestioning and unflinching faithfulness of detective Bleichert to detective Blanchard (Hartnett and Eckhart) which is crucial to the entire tale. Although the real Black Dahlia murder was never solved, in the Ellroy version we actually find out who really dunnit – a whole family of screaming nutcases – and, by the way, Fiona Shaw is especially outstanding as mother-nut of the whole butchering clan. (Just to keep track, she's Hillary Swank's mother in the flick) – I would not mind seeing this movie again just to enjoy the personalities of the actor's but I wouldn't recommend it, either to Scarlett Jo fans, or to people in need of a story that makes sense and hangs together.",The Black Dahlia
158,Scoval71,Confusing at Best,3,11 February 2007,"Like the majority of the reviewers here, I could not understand this movie and felt it was a big, awful, jumbled up mess. Fiction combined with a small dose of reality. I thank the other reviewers here for explaining the plot to me since I had no idea at all what I was watching. I knew this movie was bad after the first fifteen minutes. The casting was horrible. The acting was horrible. The only thing right was the actress who portrayed the real Elizabeth Short and the older actress who portrayed the mother. She was great. But I saw this on pay per view and, oh, dreadful is being kind. It did not look like it was from the forties, and, as I said, the wooden acting of Josh Harnett is pathetic. The wig that Hillary Swank wears changes in length from scene to scene. This movie looks like it pretends to be from the 1940's---it just looks unbelievable and as I said above---confusing at best. Awful is being kind.",The Black Dahlia
159,stevetseitz,Truly terrible.,2,13 February 2007,"This film proves that it's possible to make a film so bad that it emits a stench while being viewed. Brian De Palma can be an artist, but like many artists, when unrestrained he can overindulge his own appetites. It's like a B-movie remake of ""L.A. Confidential"" without the humor, class, or acting. Hartnett is wooden. Johanssen is vacuous and Swank's performance approaches high-camp. I hope people who see this film won't be too turned off because some excellent movies have been made of this genre including the aforementioned ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""Chinatown"" Do yourself a favor and skip this piece of junk because I already wasted the two hours and two minutes for you. You're welcome.",The Black Dahlia
160,bergma15@msu.edu,When will Elizabeth Short's murder get some good press?,4,28 September 2006,"Since I was a child, I have loved film noir. I think it started when my parents made me watch ""The Maltese Falcon"" at age 5. Needless to say, I have jumped at just about every detective film set in the 1930s, 40s, or early 50s. I even like the neo-noir stuff. When I saw that this film was coming out I almost jumped through the roof. It looked like it had everything I like. There was a true unsolved murder, it is a noir-esquire film, and even the cast looked fantastic. However, for some reason this falls far short of the mark.The story revolves around two detectives (Josh Hartnett and Aaron Eckhart) who have been assigned together. The story is told through Bucky Bleichert's (Hartnett) narrative in true noir fashion. Blanchard (Eckhart) and his live in girlfriend, Kay Lake (Scarlett Johansson) take Bucky in, but it becomes apparent to him that they are hiding some dark secret (get used to having dark secrets fly around like kung fu fighters in a John Woo film cause this movie's got a lot of them). Bucky and Blanchard begin investigating the murder of Elizabeth Short, nicknamed the black dahlia by the press, (Mia Kirshner) and Blanchard becomes obsessed with finding the killer. Bucky's investigation leads him to a dead ringer for the dead girl, Madeleine Linscott (Hilary Swank), who has her own secrets. Bucky and Madeleine start having an affair (he discovered her at a lesbian nightclub). This is just a bare bones version of what is happening. If I were to go into the rest, I could be here longer than it would take to watch the film. I think one problem with this movie is that it is going in too many directions at once. Granted, noir films often have multiple plots, but this one seems to have had too many. I think it may have been manageable if it weren't for the fact that the thing didn't seem to be that well directed. The actors and actresses, to their credit, do a good job, but something is still missing. The production value is high, but there are fatal flaws. The Dahlia murder is in the movie, but with all the other goings on it seems to be more of a footnote than the essential string holding it together. In addition, I don't think that this film was really the proper style for Brian DePalma. Not to pass judgment on his talents as a director, but there is something about the direction in this film that just doesn't feel right. Again, this probably goes back to the fact that the plot is tough to find. It seems like they got too wrapped up in the emotion and forgot the story. If you were going for ""Chinatown"", you got ""The Two Jakes."" It's really a shame that this production didn't work out that well because I think it had quite a bit going for it.If you want neo-noir, watch ""L.A. Confidential"" or ""Chinatown.""",The Black Dahlia
161,Robert_Hearth,"""Nothing Stays Buried ForeverNothing."" --- Officer Dwight 'Bucky' Bleichert",6,11 March 2007,"""The Black Dahlia"" (2006) Directed By: Brian De Palma Starring: Josh Hartnett, Scarlett Johansson, Aaron Eckhart, Hilary Swank, Mia Kirshner, Mike Starr, & Fiona Shaw MPAA Rating: ""R"" (for strong violence, some grisly images, sexual content and language) Much like with ""All the King's Men"", I first saw the trailer for ""The Black Dahlia"" when I went to see ""Hollywoodland"" and my first reaction was, ""That is going to be an amazing movie!"" Well, to my surprise, critics were not very kind to the movie and what seemed like a sure Oscar contender, suddenly, became just another typical movie. From the negative reactions of critics, it didn't look like this would win any Oscars any time soonunless it was a technical Oscar because, honestly, everyone pretty much agreed that ""The Black Dahlia"", if nothing else, looked beautiful. Well, I still had to see it, because, like with ""All the King's Men"", I was hoping that critics were wrong. If you have read my review of ""All the King's Men"", then you know that I pretty much agreed with critics (awarding it a measly 2/10), so the question with ""The Black Dahlia"" is: Were the critics right? Officer Dwight 'Bucky' Bleichert (Hartnett) and his partner, Sergeant Leland 'Lee' Blanchard are investigating the brutal murder of fledgling film actress, Elizabeth Short (Kirchner) whose butchered body was found in a field. She had had her mouth sliced open and had been cut in half. When Lee develops a surprising obsession with the mystery and the murder victim, Bucky begins to realize that there are darker, more sinister truths at work and that everyone is somehow involved with the mystery. In Hollywood, nothing stays buried forevernothing. ""The Black Dahlia"" was inspired by the real life murder of Elizabeth Short and is an adaptation of the James Ellroy novel. If you are familiar at all with the case, you will know that much of the material presented in this movie and in the novel is fictitious. In fact, the only truly honest aspect of the movie is that Short was murdered (the way in which she was is also accurate). Everything else, for the most part, is fabricated.Critics were, unfortunately, partially correct when they judged ""The Black Dahlia"". It is one of the most convoluted films I have ever seen. Characters are thrown at us and are never fully explained. The various character relationships are typically so stretched and awkward that they don't fully support the choppy story. However, ""The Black Dahlia"" does still have enough positive aspects to make me recommend it. It is one of the most visually beautiful films of the year and successfully captures the mood of the era in which it was set. The performances are all well-done and are quite efficient. On top of that, I still enjoyed trying to figure out the movie, though I didn't buy the difficult story at all. I still have yet to decipher it all, but, with a few more viewings, I should have it all clear. Overall, ""The Black Dahlia"" is not necessarily a very intelligent movie (though it pretends to be), but it is still a well-made film that is quite enjoyable, despite an overly-complicated plot and thin character relationships.Josh Hartnett is an average actor. He has never had a really dynamic role and this is no exception. His character is not a very interesting one and, in all actuality, he often finds himself overshadowed by the supporting cast. Scarlett Johansson is a very good actress and she does a nice job here, giving a sympathetic and vulnerable performance. Aaron Eckhart is one of the best actors working today and has really just burst into the minds of audiences with a phenomenal performance in the bitter comedy, ""Thank You for Smoking"". He does a great job here, understanding the obsession of his character without overplaying it or overacting. It worked very well. Hilary Swank, the two-time Oscar winner, doesn't give her best performance and I thought her accent here was awkward, but she does a competent enough job. I bought it! When ""The Black Dahlia"" ended, I was completely and utterly confused. But, I wanted to see it again. I wanted to figure it out. It is that interest and that intrigue that makes me recommend it.Final Thought: With amazing visuals and impressive direction from De Palma, ""The Black Dahlia"" manages to be a confusing, but intriguing watch.Overall Rating: 6/10 (B)",The Black Dahlia
162,das417,A crime made worse by a poor movie,2,30 December 2006,"The Black Dahlia is one of the most shocking unsolved mysteries in American history which saw a young woman butchered and left in an open field. However, that pales in comparison to the mystery as why this movie was made and the casting for it. If the murder was one of the most infamous in American history, the movie should be condemned and never seen again.Dwight ""Bucky"" Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) is paired with Leland ""Lee"" Blanchard (Aaron Eckart) after a publicity stunt to gain more money for the LAPD. Through Blanchard, Dwight is introduced to Kay Lake (Scarlett Johansson) who forms what become a friendship trio. As with two older brothers with a little sister, the three of them sustain each other as Bleichert and Blanchard make one arrest after another and help bring criminals to justice.However, this changes the moment when a young girl named Elizabeth Short (Mia Kirshner) is found murdered and drags the entire city of LA into a frenzy. Dubbed the Black Dhalia, the murder of Elizabeth drags both Dwight, Leland, and Kay to the breaking point as the murder takes over their lives in a hunt to track down the murderer.While this sounds like a good plot, The Black Dahalia comes apart(no pun intended) through bad acting, poor writing, and lack of even a coherent story. While pretending to be a movie about this murder, we instead see countless ramblings and convoluted ""clues"" that really point no where except towards suspects who don't seem to have any connection except through the poor writing. I couldn't see how any of this really made sense through Dwights constant thoughts we hear aloud and Blanchards obsession with the case. We see a dubious wealthy family drawn into the crime and a eventual relationship with one of the prime suspects but even then its shallow and hard to see how it helps the story. The conclusion to the crime itself is shallow and only leaves more questions such as how anyone could have figured it out. The most annoying part of the whole ordeal, and perhaps the aspect that made it so unbearable, was the fact that it was filmed as a classic mystery from the 40's would have looked and felt like. We have the over dramatic music at certain scenes, cut aways every second, and melodramatic lines pleading love. I wasn't sure why the director would use such a filming technique except to maybe cover up the fact that the script itself was weak without the reminder that this was a movie about the 40's. Instead of adding suspension it only made the move almost humorous as the actors struggled to fit this old model with an already weak script. The fact that Josh Hartnett can't act only made it worse.If the movie had remained focused on the Black Dahalia instead of the constant nonsense that runs through Dwight's head, the relationship between him, Lee, and Kay, then the movie may have been worthwhile. Instead, it felt as it the move was not so much about the Black Dahalia but instead three friends and their relationship. A worse movie could not be imagined for this crime which will always remain a mystery.2/10",The Black Dahlia
163,JimD73,"A boring, convoluted and untentionally funny waste of time",2,16 September 2006,"I hate intros, especially when there was no reason to see the movie other than the fact that I was bored. It's pretty impossible to think of what to open with when you have nothing to go on. That's the case with The Black Dahlia, a boredom view that actually did have some expectations thanks to the solid cast line-up. The fact that I didn't have high expectations probably made this movie a lot less brutal for me, as it is a convoluted and laughable film.The movie is about two Los Angeles cops, Bucky Bleichert (Hartnett) and Lee Blanchard (Eckhart). They bond through their shared past-time as boxers, where they are used as a publicity stunt to gain support for a bill. After that, they become partners. While working on another case, they stumble across the body of Elizabeth Short (Kirschner), a young wannabe actress, whose body has been mutilated in a grotesque way. Despite the fact that they aren't put on the case, the two become deeply involved, with Blanchard becoming obsessed and Bleichart finding himself deep in the web of lies that surround Elizabeth Short, including Madeleine Linscott (Swank), the lesbian daughter of a rich man willing to trade sexual favours to keep her name out of the paper.Well, I like to think that is what the movie is about. In reality, the movie makes little to no sense, jumping arbitrarily from one plot point to another. How Bleichart connects any of the dots is unknown, as many of the things he realizes are either so vague that the audience can't follow or just pure random chance. The movie is so convoluted that you have to turn your brain off, because actually trying to follow the movie just gives you a headache. The noir-style voice-over could have been used to explain what was actually happening, but instead the audience is just left to figure everything out by themselves.That would be fine and dandy if it made any sense. The whole movie seems to be leading up to something, but it ends with a fizz rather than a bang. The twist is incredibly predictable, despite some of the inner workings that don't click immediately only because no one could pay attention in the middle. The actual ending is one of the most unintentionally funny sequences in cinematic history, making it almost worth watching if you're a masochist.While the horribly confusing plot is pretty bad, the acting does absolutely nothing to make the movie any more watchable. Hartnett, who impressed with his role in Lucky Number Slevin, is extremely boring as the protagonist, proving he perhaps isn't ready to carry a movie or (more likely) the directing of this movie was god-awful. Scarlett Johansson basically sleepwalks as Blanchard's girlfriend, though there is some chemistry between her and Hartnett. Eckhart is utterly wasted, having some good moments in the first half but being reduced to resident wacko in the second. Hilary Swank goes against type and gets a great femme fatale look, proving she isn't just good for masculine roles, but her fading accent is continually annoying, as is the fact that she doesn't look anything like Mia Kirschner when that is actually a plot point.The one surprise is Mia Kirschner, who, with her ten minutes of screen time, has a much greater impact than the entire cast put together. Most of her screen time is in the form of audition tapes, which show Short attempting to get a role in a movie despite her obvious lack of talent. While some may say playing an untalented actress may not be a stretch, Kirschner develops a layered character just in the way her eyes emote. It may not be enough to make up for the movie, but Kirschner shows here that she is much more than that badass beyotch from 24.The directing style is actually fairly interesting. De Palma, who hasn't done anything worth mentioning since at least 1996, does manage to create a very film noir style tone that gives the movie some degree of originality. There is even a gravely voice-over from Josh Hartnett, which is used to explain the obvious rather than the thought processes (because apparently even the scriptwriters didn't understand that). It's interesting for the first while, but eventually, like the rest of the movie, it gets boring.Out of all the times I have been in the theatre, I may never have been as fidgety as I was during this movie. Sure, maybe the fact that I think my seat was broken played a part, but the main reason was that I have never cared so little about what I was watching than when I saw this movie. It's a detached, convoluted and occasionally unintentionally funny piece of crap that isn't worth the film it's printed on. Not even an incredible performance from Mia Kirschner can save that.",The Black Dahlia
164,TheGOLDENWALRUS,confusing mess but at least the cinematography was good,4,10 January 2007,"Have you ever seen one of those trailers in where you must see the film? This film is it except luckily I missed it in the theaters. The plot is hard to determine and the casting was bad. I love Josh Hartnett and Scarlett Johanson but they did not fit their parts. Aaron Eckhart was pretty good and Hilary Swank was actually pretty good. This movie was paced poorly and I didn't really care what happens at the end. It didn't intrigue me.With this being said, the cinematography was good. I love the crane shot where a women is screaming about the dead body. It was a long smooth shot. I also love the extreme angle where they are studying the body. The editing was pretty good but there was two many wipes.All in all this movie missed and the trailer is not what the movie turned out to be.4.5\10",The Black Dahlia
165,fdbjr,The Tracking Shot,2,19 September 2006,"The only good shot in this hopeless mishmash of a movie, a long tracking shot in which the corpse is seen in an open field and a woman runs for help while a shoot out takes place, is as I recall swiped from similar staging in Hitchcock's 1937 picture 'Young and Innocent'. It also has a resemblance to a scene in Frenzy. Why De Palma does this, over and over, is beyond me. There is nothing in this movie that justifies its making. The plot is bizarre, turning on coincidences that are not easy to follow in a first (and in my case, only) viewing. The campy scenes are ludicrous. The motivation of the Hilary Swank character is impossibly convoluted. the resolution of the case makes no sense at all. People interested in a real film noir will do infinitely better with 'Double Indemnity'.",The Black Dahlia
166,the_Poppuns,"Stay, sugar. Stay.",9,15 September 2006,"I don't know why but I loved that line. And I don't really know what I think about The Black Dahlia. I know that I like it. Well, I felt that I liked it. But having read most of the reviews that are trashing this movie, I don't disagree with them that much. They say that it's incoherent. I wouldn't go that far, but I'm not exactly sure what happened. But having seen other noir from De Palma, I know that I personally have to watch them more than once to catch everything that is going on. It was that way with Body Double and Femme Fatale, so when I knew I should be making connections in The Black Dahlia but it was going by too quickly for me, I knew that it will right itself when I see it again. Well, at least I believe it will.The performances were great as far as I'm concerned so I don't agree with anyone who is knocking any of the actors. I really enjoyed Fiona Shaw. She has two great scenes at the end of which I felt like cheering. She was truly insane. Josh Hartnett is very good in the lead role and I wouldn't have thought of him for something like this, but he fits in perfectly. He and Eckhart have a great chemistry.The most noticeable thing about The Black Dahlia is how gorgeous everything is. It's really luminous and dark at the same time. There were a few instances where I wished I could have paused the movie to just look at some of the shots a little longer. That's what I've always loved about noir, but it's so opulent here that I can't think of another movie that even comes close except maybe Road to Perdition.This is the kind of movie you really can't recommend to everyone. You have to know the person you're advising to see it pretty well. It's for noir fans, who maybe have seen De Palma's work before and will understand it. It's not for CSI types, although the trailers may make it seem like it would be. There is very little investigation, it's more like series of mysteries with a series of revelations that just happen. I would almost think that everyone who liked Mulholland Dr. would like this, but anyone who prefers those movies where Ashley Judd solves crimes probably would not.edit: after seeing the movie again on DVD, I do understand it much better and it makes perfect sense. It's a shame that movies like this can be dismissed because of their complexity.",The Black Dahlia
167,Manal1987,A Huge DePalma Flunk!,2,7 November 2012,"Despite the topnotch cast and performance, the movie failed drastically. Apparently, Josh Friedman lost his grip of the story and, as a result, it went completely loose. The plot started to move into incomplete, overlapping circles that lead nowhere and I found it extremely difficult to understand what's going on. A lot of undeveloped characters unjustifiably came into the limelight and then suddenly disappeared. Moreover, the last 30 minutes in the movie were truly surreal! I couldn't make heads or tails of the unfolding truth and it seemed like the ending was forced. I still can't believe that this was directed by 'The' Brian DePalma!",The Black Dahlia
168,Phantasm01,I expected more....,3,23 September 2007,"There is an interesting story to be told about Elizabeth Short aka ""The Black Dahlia"". The name alone elicits a lot of mystery and intrigue. Short's graphic murder is one of Los Angeles most famous crimes and it still remains unsolved till this day. In 1987 James Ellroy wrote a book called The Black Dahlia which centers around a group of fictional characters and uses the Short murder as its backdrop. The book became a huge bestseller and created an even larger following of those who were interested in The Black Dahlia's story.L.A.P.D. detectives Bucky Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) and Lee Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) are the department's stars because of their unparalleled record in bringing fugitives to justice. At the time of the infamous ""Black Dahlia"" murder, where the dismembered body of aspiring actress Elizabeth Short (Mia Kirshner) is discovered in an open field, Bucky and Lee are working another case, tracking a child rapist. However, Lee becomes obsessed with the Short killing and aggressively pursues a seven-day transfer for himself and Bucky to the taskforce. Bucky agrees only reluctantly, however, believing it's more important to get their original quarry off the streets. Investigating Short's past leads Bucky to femme fatale Madeline Linscott (Hilary Swank), with whom he begins a relationship. Meanwhile, sparks are flying between Bucky and Lee's girlfriend, Kay (Scarlett Johansson), but neither acts on them out of respect for Lee.Like I said, I can see how this material could be captivating on the page. It really feels like it would be well suited for that medium. I think a part of the reason this failed is the fault of the marketing campaign for the film when it was released. The marketing department played up the based on a true story elements and made it seem like a crime thriller directly about Elizabeth Short. The truth is in the nearly 2 hour running time, The Black Dahlia herself gets about 10 minutes of screen time via some haunting screentests (more on that later) and the case itself makes up about 20-30 minutes of the plot. The rest is the not interesting partnership between Bucky and Lee, the girl in the middle subplot involving Kay, and Bucky's encounter with a femme fetale by the name of Madeline. All these stories combined do not achieve the same interest as Short's story. The fact the film constantly sways to bore us with their goings on, becomes a bit tiresome after awhile.Then there is the ending which takes not 1 but 2 lengthy monologues to explain. To call it completely outrageous would be a compliment. For those of you who don't know about the real case, the explanation for the who and why involving Short's murder is purely fictional. The real killer was never caught and the story remains unsolved. Since this is partly a movie of fiction I expected them to tack on an ending ""revealing her murderer"" but did it have to be done in such a silly manner? I nearly laughed out loud when it was all revealed. The movie literally comes to an abrupt halt when all of this takes place.Viusally the film is excellent. 1940's Los Angeles has never looked so good and it rightfully deserved its Best Cinematography nomination. Everyone looks great in their 1940's period garb and the film actually crackles with energy when time is taken to soak in all the atmosphere. Elizabeth Short's screentest's are also well done in the film. They're done in a simple old school black and white and they leave a rather haunting impression . I became enthralled by the film whenever one was started but unfortunately they don't dominate the film.The acting is a bit of a mixed bag. Josh Hartnett has always been up and down as an actor to me and for the most part he's a little flat here. His voice is actually just right for the film noir style narration that goes on in the film, but during scenes that require deep emotion he can't seem to get it together. Scarlett Johansson is another weak link. This girl is incredibly overrated in my opinion and she keeps proving it with several lackluster performances. The only thing I've loved this girl in was Match Point but I guess that was a fluke. Actually Hartnett and Johansson appear to be a bit out of their league here. Almost like children playing dress up. Aaron Eckhart fares better out of the male leads. His character is a bit interesting but unfortunately Hartnett's character gets more exposure. Eckhart has proved himself to be a good performer, even in lackluster fare. The real surprises are Hilary Swank and Mia Kirshner. Swank is hard to take at first as the sultry femme fetale but as the film goes on she slips well into the role. It was interesting to see her finally be able to play sexy and maybe they should give her more opportunities to do so. Mia Kirshner is mesmerizing as Elizabeth Short. She only appears in the screentest footage but she is truly captivating. The fact that she acts circles around Johansson and Hartnett with only about 10 minutes of screen time is pretty amazing. I wanted more of her. I literally could not take my eyes off of her while she was on screen. She gives humanity to the role and allows us to identify with her in only a short amount of time.I really wanted to like The Black Dahlia. I had high hopes but ultimately the film is suffering from a serious identity crisis. Like I said, there is an interesting story to be told about the mysteries murder of Elizabeth Short but unfortunately this is not it.

169,jasontheterrible,Why Did They Remake Another Classic Like The Black Dahlia?,1,25 March 2021,"You may have noticed that Hollywood has rushed to erase all of your favorite, classic films of the 30s through the 80's with new models. That is so no one will ever go watch the originals. If they do go watch them to compare, they will be tainted and biased by the new version, and unable to enjoy the experience. Besides remaking this Black Dahlia with ridiculous lines and story changes, they filled it with as much vile language and repulsive images as possible. They also made sure to highlight how evil one race is versus another. They forever aim to please the diversity crowd. But since their favorite haters remain a minority of the country, these films lose a lot of money,But they do not care about that, since America has made them filthy rich. They really and truly do not need the money. They are comforted knowing another classic that we loved will soon become obsolete and forgotten. They know that most people do not read reviews of their disasters, and eventually will watch them. They will absorb the films like this in perpetuity. Yes, forever. Hollywood and The Left has been on a mission to create the most disgusting characterizations of America, its heroes, and a certain race as possible, for decades. At the same time, they have lionized other races and sexes to make sure audiences despise one group and root for the other in film, and in life. Since any group, nation, or people divided against itself, cannot stand, this will not end well. And that is their plan folks.",The Black Dahlia
170,misbegotten,"A potentially good film, sunk by an unimpressive lead performance from Josh Hartnett",6,13 June 2012,"While THE BLACK DAHLIA fails to reach the high standard set by L.A. CONFIDENTIAL (the film it most resembles) it's still a bleak, stylish, moody and worthwhile noir thriller. In the title role, Mia Kirshner give a luminous and heartbreaking performance, one of the best I've seen since Naomi Watts's turn in MULHOLLAND DRIVE (in what was ironically a similar role). Sadly, THE BLACK DAHLIA did not boost Kirshner's career in the same way that MULHOLLAND DRIVE did for Watts.Aaron Eckhart - in what proved to be a breakthrough part after too many years tucked away in supporting roles - also shines as a detective who's starting to crack up, and Scarlett Johansson also impresses, despite having an underwritten role as his chaste girlfriend. Hilary Swank smolders as a spoilt heiress who frequents the fleshpots of Hollywood, and Rose McGowan has an amusing cameo as a bit part actress who's interviewed by the cops while dressed as an Egyptian servant girl.The film looks great, with terrific period detail, and cinema buffs will be delighted by references to the classic silent movie THE MAN WHO LAUGHS, which actually inspired the creation of comic book villain The Joker. Fans of director Brian De Palma will also recognise some of his trademark touches in the film, especially a heavily stylised death scene involving a stairwell and a fountain. I'll say no more, other than to report that at the cinema screening I attended most of the audience either cried out or audibly winced during that sequence.Of course, THE BLACK DAHLIA - like every film - has it's flaws, most noticeable of which is an unimpressive and underpowered performance by Josh Hartnett in the lead. His character is supposed to be at the centre of a maelstrom of horrendous murder, forbidden love, torrid lust, betrayal, shattered dreams, forlorn hope and misplaced trust, but Hartnett never comes close to registering the emotions his character should be feeling. With this vacuum at it's heart (the entire story is seen through Hartlett's eyes), the film is thrown off-balance and never really grips you, and as a result we don't really care for the characters as much as you should, despite the fine work by the rest of the cast. There's also a badly judged and misplaced cameo by k d lang which breaks the otherwise flawless period atmosphere and caused tittering amongst the audience I saw the movie with. It's an unnecessary gimmick that wasn't needed.",The Black Dahlia
171,lee_a_scott,Muddled and clumsy,6,14 October 2007,"Having read the book on which this is based, I was at least able to make sense of the otherwise inexplicable leaps of deduction that all seem to drop into Josh Hartnett's lap at the flat conclusion to a film that offered promise but pretty much failed to deliver across the board. I understand that De Palma was trying to evoke classic noir in his direction and the performances of the actors, which is all fine and good so long as a) someone lets Hartnett know so that he doesn't seem to be in a totally different film and, b) someone lets Scarlett Johansson know that there's more to a noir dame than pouting (and, by the way, not showing Scarlett off in some more voluptuously inclined outfits in a 40s set film is unforgivable  watch Jennifer Connelly in The Rocketeer to see how Scarlett should have been dressed!). Good points  well, so far I've been a bit harsh. It is, in the end, a reasonably enjoyable crime-thriller. The main problem is that, in trying to adapt a typically labyrinthine James Ellroy novel, all the police work was left out, so the whole thing seems to move forward based on coincidence and whimsy which, given the calibre of the cast, was a shame.",The Black Dahlia
172,cwrdlylyn,"THE BLACK DAHLIA : 2006's Best Film Noir So Far... Not Saying That Much, But It's Something",5,26 September 2006,"THE BLACK DAHLIA Perhaps THE BLACK DAHLIA gets off easy because when viewed in close succession to the similarly themed HOLLYWOODLAND... it soars in comparison. When it comes to 2006 film noir efforts, THE BLACK DAHLIA is vastly superior in terms of direction, style, performances, and structure. But being better then HOLLYWOODLAND doesn't mean much in my book.THE BLACK DAHLIA explores the mystery behind the murder of Elizabeth Short (played hypnotically by Mia Kirshner). In the 1940's, the young Ms. Short, an aspiring actress, was found roadside cut into two hollowed out shells of a corpse. The investigation of her murder led the L.A.P.D. in a whirlwind, with the centerpieces being Dwight ""Bucky"" Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) and Leland ""Lee"" Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart).Lee and Bucky are new partners on the force, but old friends who live in an odd romantic triangle with a woman named Kay Lake (a wooden and stuffy Scarlett Johansson). Though Kay is clearly with Lee, the tension between her and Bucky is apparent. However, as Lee descends into madness, Bucky's world shifts. Kay expresses more need for him as he becomes entangled in a romantic affair with Madeleine Linscott (Hillary Swank, wonderful in a sexy role). As one can assume, the film does not stick to the truth behind the case very closely.Directed by Brian DePalma, THE BLACK DAHLIA has a strong visual structure and is always captivating to watch. DePalma manages to create quite an impact with the footage of Short before her death, and his camera-work on scenes such as the Linscott dinner and the boxing match between Lee and Bucky. However, while DePalma excels at visual structure, he falters in terms of actual plot structure.While THE BLACK DAHLIA has many of the ingredients for great film noir, it never gels due to a problematic script. It's never clear where our sympathy should lie, nor is it ever clear who the primary suspect is. Though we find out in the end who the killer is and it is placed blatantly before our eyes... all the bits and pieces that add up to this don't really make sense. By giving virtually every character in the film a dark twist, the audience can't follow who did what.THE BLACK DAHLIA left me intrigued, but entirely confused. Still, I enjoyed the film enough to revisit it again in the future to see if my confusion could only be blamed on a complicated plot that is difficult to absorb on one viewing. The film also bolsters a handful of surprising performances. Never has Josh Hartnett been this believable in an adult role, and he proves that he might have what it takes to cross over into a respected career. In a similar vein, though Hillary Swank has always been captivating to watch, this is the first time she has proved that her incredible acting talents can remain apparent even while playing a sexy woman. Finally, Mia Kirshner is incredibly captivating even with her limited screen name as the murder victim. However, even more resonant then the good performances is the disappointing one offered by Hollywood It-Girl Scarlett Johannson. In a role that seems perfectly catered to her sexy beyond her years persona, Johannson can't even so much as smoke a cigarette convincingly here... what happened?! In the end, THE BLACK DAHLIA is a film that still has promise after one viewing. I will certainly see it again and be able to more properly assess it's quality when I give the twists and turns in the plot a closer inspection. For now, though flawed, it can safely be labeled the best 1940's film noir of 2006... leagues ahead of the abysmal HOLLYWOODLAND.... C+ ...",The Black Dahlia

However, although his directing style is present (long scenes and cameras that move with the action) the film was one of the most confusing I have seen in a long time. So many names were mentioned that I could not keep track of who they were talking about. The narration (always a bad sign in a movie) did not help much to carry the story forward. Much of the movie had nothing to do with The Black Dahlia case (the boxing segment was totally unnecessary). What ultimately really ticked me off was the explanation of the murder---this case is famous for being UNSOLVED---why would the writer feel he could change the facts so much as to assert to the audience that it was solved!!",The Black Dahlia
174,wilsonstuart-32346,Doesn't Do Justice To The Source Material.,5,12 October 2018,"The horrific 1947 murder of Elizabeth Short - a self proclaimed young aspiring actress, but really a dreamer, rough sleeper and a transient; possibly involved in prostitution, or even the periphery of organised crime - has been committed to film and literature many times over. Given the savagery of the crime, the wave of resultant mass hysteria, stoked by yellow press coverage, the proliferation of suspects and conspiracy theories, The Dahlia is often regarded as one of America's first post-war American murder mysteries - her sad story, given additional impetus by Hollywood, impacted on a great many lives, including a young Ellroy's, who eventually projected his formative experiences into Betty's unsolved mystery.I remember leaving the cinema feeling both impressed and disappointed. Certainly, the visual and photography are quite good at face value - and De Palma's stylist tricks are evident, and given his record the likes of Dressed To Kill, Body Double and Carries, I thought this would be meat and drink for him- but the Tinsletown gloss is trowled on here. While LA Confidential was deliberately chintzy, The Black Dahlia is a facsimile that simply tries too hard to be a baroque murder mystery.It's clear that even after twenty years in gestation, neither director, screenwriters or producers got to grips with the source material the way Curtis Hansen did - ruthlessly and to the benefit of a good storytellling. There's snappy dialogue, sure, but the narrative is simply bogged down with too much character backstory, plot twists, sub-plots and endless exposition - the boxing match, the Zoot Suit riot, the love triangle, Bucky's obsessions with Beth and Madeleine, Bucky's relationship with Kay, Bucky's relationship with Lee, Lee's secrets, Bobby De Witt...all this on top of The Dahlia mystery reveals a screenplay just too flimsy a bag too sustain so much complexity.The lack of focus is reflected in performances - Scarlett Johansson's Kay Lake is a colourless Lauren Bacall lookalike, not Ellroy's street smart victim and keeper of secrets; Josh Harnett is actually OK as Bucky Bleichert (he's the right age for a start)- but I never got a sense of the character's isolation, or his lack of moral fibre hiding behind that toughness; Lee Blanchard is little more than a raving nutcase in the hands of Aaron Eckhart, not the phelgmatic, but emotionally unstable, as well as devious, boxer-cop/killer/bankrobber in the novel; Hilary Swank is a decent Madeleine; Fiona Shaw and Rose McGowan are a bit OTT, but I suppose that fits the attempt at the gothic atmosphere (to a degree); Mia Krishner, however, is compelling as the doomed, vulnerable Elizabeth Short; given that Madeleine supposedly looks like Beth, surely it would have made more sense to give Krishner both roles and let Swank - the better choice IMO - portray Kay Lake?If you want a definitive (albeit loose) film version of The Black Dahlia mystery try True Confessions with Robert De Niro, Robert Duvall and Charles Durning; it may have flaws, but it's miles streets ahead of this glossy, overstuffed mess. Praise to Mia Krishner, but the rest of cast is left at sea by the self indulgence of the writer and director.",The Black Dahlia

176,J-bot6,Unbalanced,6,25 September 2017,"This film's a bit unusual in that the peripheral actors outperform the lead actors. Scarlett Johansson, Hilary Swank, Josh Harnett, and Aaron Eckhart turn in over-the-top performances that tend to repeatedly rip the viewer out of the movie.In contrast, Mia Kirshner, Mike Starr, James Otis, and Fiona Shaw did a great job. To be fair, the more subdued scenes with Aaron Eckhart were quite good.The style of filming is pretty cool. I'm certainly a fan of noir films. However, there's something about the exterior period sets that don't seem quite right. Maybe it's that they're so squeaky clean. As hard as this film tried to be genuine, it still felt contrived -- both in performance and appearance. Then there's the character development side of it. It would have been nice if some time was cut from the boxing match and a bit more time spent on the characters and their interactions. Things happen between characters in this film as if almost instantaneously. Some kind of method of showing that time has passed before major shifts in attitude take place between characters would help a lot. The current cut makes it seem like the characters change their minds suddenly and almost without explanation. It's pretty confusing to watch -- and that's not even factoring in the convoluted plot. Black Dahlia is a movie that wants to generate atmosphere, but it can't. If a person wants a modern take on noir with a bit of camp, they're probably better off playing through Bioshock 2. For Black Dahlia to really work, any and all camp (and any hyper-real portrayals) need to be eliminated.

I encourage those with any curiosity about the real black dahlia mystery to do some research, including the names Knowlton and Dr. Hodel. Especially 'the Sowden house' basement, where its believed Ms Short was murdered. The murderer was never prosecuted because of his ties to city hall.In all its a much better story than the one spun in ""The black dahlia"" 2006.

182,mike-925,Stunning Flora and Fauna in An Ashen Fall Movie Scene,8,28 September 2006,"James Ellroy's mother, Geneva Hilliker of Tunnel City, between Sparta and Tomah, Wisconsin, where I live, put her son on the road to writing pulp crime. Ellroy wrote a biography of Geneva,who got a job in thirties Chicago, won a beauty contest and a trip to Hollywood. She liked it so much she moved there. Where she ran into Ellroy's father, who she married and divorced. Both of the older Ellroys were drunks and tramps. After the divorce, Geneva brought home men on many nights, and made love to them in full view of her son James.It was Geneva's mysterious murder in 1958, just eleven years after the Black Dahlia murder in LA, that started James Ellroy on the road to crime. The Black Dahlia story in brief: A female passerby spots a woman's body sprawled on a vacant lot in 1947. The body had been beaten badly, cut neatly in half with scalpels, the blood drained from it, and a maniacal grin with bared teeth carved on the corpse's face. The look is similar to the mask warn in the recent film V For Vendetta. Ellroy's mother was found murdered beneath a tree outside a restaurant she had visited the night before.That insane dahlia leer allowed filmophile Brian De Palma to plumb his knowledge of earlier films, for references. Conrad Veidt, played in the 1928 silent The Laughing Man, based on a Victor Hugo novel, his face defaced by captors, was laughed at among French Nobility due to his insane countenance. Veidt played the Nazi Colonel Strasser in Casablanca. He had been in German expressionist silent films, including the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, since 1916. Veidt's Laughing Man became the model for the Joker in the comic book Batman. De Palma runs the Laughing Man film, while his two detectives search for the Dahlia murderer. Portraits of Pagliacci the Opera clown also appear in the Black Dahlia story. De Palma went wild with this.In an Ellroy novel, cops are corrupt in ways that Hammett, Chandler and Cain never dreamed of. The two cops fight a bogus boxing match promoted by the Department, in which Josh Hartnett is paid off Terry Molloy style, to throw the fight to his blondish partner Aaron Eckhardt. A Department Spin Doctor immortalizes 'Fire and Ice' in the Tabloid press. Eckhardt and Hartnett have something close to a menage going with the very hot Scarlett Johannsen, who is dolled up to look like Lana Turner in the Postman Always Rings Twice (1946). Johannsen is hot just three years after stealing the movie in a second lead in a Steve Buscemi indie comedy Ghost World. Ellroy/De Palma weave their entirely independent story about two cops around the real Black Dahlia story. The Dahlia is seen in Gower Gulch level studio screen test flashbacks in which Betty Short talks to a director off-screen: DePalma.Despite their closeness, Eckhardt is holding out on the naive Hartnett. Hartnett and Johansson are falling in love, Eckhardt barely noticing. Eckhardt continues to secretly gumshoe the Dahlia Crime while the Department complains about his truancy from duty. Hartnett covers for him and woos Scarlett. Finally, Hartnett follows Aaron to a a major showdown at a museum.The Black Dahlia is the descendant of all the film noir, LA corruption stories and Los Angeles crime myth that rise like steam from LA. Black Dahlia is the offspring but not the equal of Chinatown, itself a promulgator of the LA Corruption myth, and the first film to link the real life LA Times Chandler Family and Water Commissioner Edward Mulholland, who annexed Owens Valley's water supply, into the general LA malaise first captured by former oil company exec Raymond Chandler in Black Mask Magazine. Before Chandler, there was no 'there there' in the city of Angels.The film is complex and a challenge to follow, but a boon to an audience starved for intellectual nourishment at the movies. At the concession stand, twenty-something employees said the movie was ""wierd' and kids couldn't understand what was going on. The Kids, raised in an era columnist Clarence Page calls dumbed down by Ronald Reagan, now get their information, even education, from pop culture in high concept form, only a little tougher than a Dick and Jane book. A fortyish couple with two teenagers in tow, sat in front of me. The two kids left in twenty minutes and didn't return. Their parents sat engrossed until the end. Hillary Swank is the doyenne of a corrupt family that puts one in mind of the family Sam Spade visited in Farewell My lovely. Even the Twins in the Chandler film - screen-written by William Faulkner- get a workout in the Ellroy/DePalma tale. It turns out Swank, a dead ringer for the late Judy Garland, is an heiress Skank, who has been wearing the exact hairstyle, black dress and makeup of the Black Dahlia. Hartnett finds out that Swank was her friend. Fiona Shaw, an Irish actress, is Swank's eccentric, haughty, and insane mother, who during dinner conversation reveals her hideous insinuations about Skanks'., I mean Swank's incestuous relationship with her father, who is present but uncomfortable at the table. Some of this stuff is hilarious but it is played straight.Hillary entertains Johns just for Kinky kicks, even though she doesn't need the money. Hartnett interrupts one such date with a very plump GI, whose clothes and mien are so interesting and awful the audience wants to know more about him.If you're fast enough to pick up the flitting details from dialog, you can probably figure out in the hour and a half afterward it took a friend and I to crack it.

This is stylish neo-noir, a look at the dark underbelly of Hollywood made with panache.So, why then, is the film such a disaster? Perhaps Altman could have dealt with all the characters and the multiple story strands but DePalma present the audience with a cinematic mess; incoherent story lines, poor script, performances that veer from the merely adequate to the wildly campy all contribute to this mess. Characters that seem to have been added for colour turn out to be important protagonists whilst inordinately long stretches of the film are devoted to story development that is going nowhere.By the time Fiona Shaw pops up (seemingly under the impression that she is in a high camp remake of ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"") the film has crumbled under the weight of the poor writing and DePalma's lack of direction.",The Black Dahlia
185,DAHLRUSSELL,"Not the Black Dahlia's story, but an entertaining and engaging film.",8,19 March 2007,"DePalma's beautiful visual style permeates this film. Johansson has the perfect look for this period, but this isn't her best work, she sounds wrong and doesn't seem to really get the period. Hartnett is lovely to look at, and has that Gary Cooper vive. Eckhart was born to play noir, does his usual layered, magnificent job and is certainly easy on the eyes, too. The stand-out, really perfect here is Swank, in a very different role. She did her homework and really speaks like a noir actress she sounds like young Faye Dunnaway here, with a measured elocution that tells us something about her character as well. In her initial shot, Fiona Shaw looks so much like Mary Astor that one has to look twice, unfortunately, her performance was not reigned in and ends up being too large, and unintentionally funny.Early in the film is a gorgeous full block crane shot which sets up tension of discovery of the body in the midst of another police call. This moment is DePalma at his marvelous visual & tense best.Rose McGowan does a funny bit part for film buffs. The usually gorgeous McGowan looks awful, but it fits. Skinny, big eyed Mia Kirshner looks very very little like plumpish, small eyed Elizabeth Short, and while she does make Short pitiable, it is in telling her story where this film is very disappointing.I understand this is based on a book, but it is very sad to name a film after a real life person who was murdered, and have her life and murder used as a premise for a slylish noir romance, with almost nothing about her. The commentary on the DVD is good, and tells us that these screen tests were not even part of the initial cut, which means even less of her. So it was smart to add more. It leaves us with a deeper, sadder, unintentional question: would any of these people, the characters, or the filmmakers, have cared about her if she had not been killed? Is one of the most brutally murdered women of all time still just background material because she was an aspiring actress? Unintentionally, it says a lot about how women are viewed in Hollywood.I do not think this film, in itself, is at all disappointing. It is the title which creates the impression that this will be Short's story, and that isn't what this film is. I'm still waiting for a really good film about Short's life, journey, and the possible solutions. The only thing even near that is the Lucy Arnaz TV movie (in which she did some of her best work) that was done decades ago. Take the title away, and this film has lovely film pictures, astute costuming & decor, fantastic production values throughout, and an interesting plot. It may not please it's target audience of noir film buffs & literati, but there is plenty here to engage and entertain for a long time to come.",The Black Dahlia
186,LadyLiberty,The Black Dahlia a Bleak Disappointment,2,17 September 2006,"It's difficult not to find any story of the so-called ""Black Dahlia"" intriguing. Despite knowing the horrific murder of wannabe actress Elizabeth Short occurred some 50 years ago (in January of 1947), the gruesomeness of the killing and the cruel fact that it has remained unsolved all these years only lend to the magnetism of the story. When you combine that kind of real-life detail with a cast like the 2006 movie happens to have, well, it had to be worth seeing. Didn't it?Los Angeles cop Dwight ""Buckey"" Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) is a former light-heavyweight boxer. The police force is also fortunate to have another former boxer on its roster. Sergeant Leland ""Lee"" Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) and Officer Bleichart are talked into a promotional fight. After the well publicized fight, the two end up as partners.As well as they get along on the job, Buckey and Lee also become close in their personal lives. One factor that holds the two together happens to be their mutual regard  and love  for the beautiful Kay Lake (Scarlett Johansson). But all of their professional successes and their domestic tranquility is abruptly interrupted by the murder of aspiring actress, Elizabeth Short (Mia Kirshner).Lee becomes obsessed by the ""Black Dahlia"" killing, and with a few political machinations behind the scenes, manages to make it their case. Buckey isn't happy about the reassignment  he thinks he and his partner should continue their focus on their own pre-existing and ongoing investigation into another case  but he dutifully does his job.Buckey starts tracing Short's presumed footsteps. He looks for her friends and her usual haunts, and when he visits each, he beings to learn more about the dead girl. But the more he learns, the more mysterious the matter becomes. And when he runs into local heiress Madeleine Linscott (Hilary Swank), the few additional answers he gets results in a flood of other questions.Eventually, Buckey discovers Madeleine is everything she says and then some, but he's also distracted by Kay's anguish over Lee's consuming dedication to the Black Dahlia case. Worse, Kay fears Buckey is headed down the same road.The Black Dahlia is beautifully filmed. The sets, costuming, and even the film color make it appear to be directly out of the 1940's. Even the acting is very much of an older style with its melodrama, unnatural breaks between lines more often than not, and overly-crisp edits. Unfortunately, the look of The Black Dahlia is all that there really is to recommend it.Far too much time is dedicated to Buckey and Lee, how they meet, and the ramp-up to their boxing match. The pair's relationship with Kay is unreal at best. And even when the titular murder is finally committed, there's strangely little emotion or curiosity evoked as a result. Side plots abound, and none are given adequate shrift; the primary plot also seems only skin deep.Josh Hartnett has never been particularly emotive, but the direction here steals what little charisma he has and leaves him appearing to be all but a mannequin. Even in scenes that should be emotional, he's not. Aaron Eckhart is far better than this movie lets him be, and the same is true for Scarlett Johansson. Meanwhile, the brilliant Hilary Swank is horribly miscast here, not least because her character is supposed to bear a strong resemblance to Elizabeth Short and doesn't.Even the supporting cast suffers somewhat here. John Kavanagh, cast as the Linscott patriarch, has a Scottish accent that comes and goes. Fiona Shaw, who plays Madeleine's mother, is good, but the excessive melodrama of her character is laugh-inducing rather than suspenseful or revealing. Mia Kirshner, who does a compelling job of portraying a pretty girl who is a pretty bad actress, is the only one who manages to escape the film with her reputation intact.The script and the accompanying edits make most scenes almost independent of those coming before and after, and as a result, the story jumps around in a disconcerting fashion. The mysteries aren't terribly mysterious, and some seem utterly beside the point. Meanwhile, The Black Dahlia is less about Hollywood's most infamous murder than it is about fictional characters written around her death and who  the result again of the script  are far, far less interesting.If you're interested in seeing some truly lovely examples of film sets and cinematography, The Black Dahlia might be worth a look. But if you're headed to the theatre to see a movie you'll enjoy, don't bother.FAMILY SUITABILITY: The Black Dahlia is rated R for ""strong violence, some grisly images, sexual content and language."" While I've certainly seen worse, I do believe the R rating is warranted here. In addition to the violence, there is also some minimal nudity, and though the most grisly images are likely to be in your imagination, there are a few flashes of a corpse that are none too pretty. If you must see this film  and again, I'd recommend it only to those interested in the artistry of the production  I'd keep the kids under 16 or so out of the theatre.",The Black Dahlia
187,IOBdennis,The Black Dahlia is a Black Hole,2,24 January 2007,"What is this mish-mash? I was thoroughly puzzled by the whole thing. Yes, it was supposed to be a mystery, but the audience isn't supposed to be asking questions during the movie like: ""Now what are they doing?"" ""Who?"" ""What?"" For example, right in the middle of one shoot-em-up sequence, important action is occurring in the background, way in the background--literally--and you wonder what the hell is going on. But somehow the focus of these events doesn't shift until several minutes later. It was irritating. With so many questions while I was watching, I couldn't figure out why so-and-so was supposed to have done it. If indeed, the supposed-to was ever even hinted at! And I refuse to watch this film again. I couldn't sit through it. While the film is nominated for Best Cinematography, I could go for that. It is a wonderfully realized visual work, and that's basically what kept me going throughout the movie: not the story, not the characters, but the sets and the way it was being shot.

188,SeamusMacDuff,So Noir You Can't Tell What's Going On,3,8 June 2019,"The disclaimer at the end should have been up front: This is not about the Black Dahlia case but rather a novel about the Black Dahlia case. That kind of confusion is rife throughout the film as is it pinwheels around with a confusing plot, subplots, over-acting, underacting, sepia tones, back stories, etc. etc. etc.Two detectives stage a boxing match that takes 1/3 of the film. Then then titular murder occurs. One detective becomes obsessed with the case, the other with a femme fatale who looks like the victim. Eckhardt over-acts, Hartnett under-acts, and manyly Swank as said femme is unrealistic - a rich girl who dresses like a swanky (!) spider to lure random men to cheap hotels for sex in front of the window. Johansen looks great but also does little, even as she's in a triangle with the detectives. Sex has rarely been so gratuitous and less sexy, including the Dahlia seen only in screen tests and a lesbian stag film. The clear-the-dinner-table sex between Hartnett and Johanson is particularly poorly done. (He can't even clear it well.)I'm not sure where the plot went, or was supposed to go. Things happen here there and everywhere. Viewers I guess are just supposed to bask in noirish LA and recall how Chinatown and LA Confidential did it so much better.",The Black Dahlia
189,folsominc2,Insult to the Viewer's Intelligence,1,5 September 2007,"I have to admit as a movie connoisseur that I have seen a lot of movies from Silents to before censorship to the Golden Age of Hollywood to after censorship in the 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's to today's rather mixed plots and metaphors.However, I must admit that I have never quite saw as poorly a produced film as ""The Black Dahlia"" from 2006.I actually bought the DVD at a cut rate as a PVT. I had never seen, and strangely never even heard of the movie before, but since I am a bit of a history buff and like information on unsolved murders, I thought it would give me a new twist to the plot.What was presented in this film was a very bad script that must have come from a crackerjack box; costuming and men's hairstyles that was obviously not researched since their style was of 20s and 30s; a plot that was so convoluted and warped that you couldn't follow any clues (except the more than obvious final murderess, yeah that was pretty obvious); disgusting and blatant homosexuality when during the 1940s, homosexuality was against the law - even in Los Angeles; not one character that could be considered a ""hero"" type; stifled and ham acting so bad that the silent period of Cecil B. DeMille's looked like classic work compared to it; a film presented as NEW to the characters that WAS from the silent period; and finally, props that were so obviously fake - like the large cop sitting beside the young cop on the bumper of a car and the car not even bouncing! I won't mention the obvious ploy of sexual and bisexual situations as well as the foul language that was included whenever and wherever they could fit in - totally unnecessary.I know of artistic license but the strategic facts in lifestyle and fashion is one thing that needs to be right to be believable.If Josh Hartnett thought he was playing a role Bogie would have bargained for, he was completely off his lid. Bogart would have warmed up the fireplace for Bacall with such a piece of trash.And by the way, Josh Hartnett, that is Humphrey Bogart to you - one of the best actors for the detective film noir that ever lived.What this movie was is not only an insult to the memory of Elizabeth Short and the murder investigation that was never solved but to the intelligence of the viewer who was looking for - perhaps not the solution to the horrendous crime - but at least an intellectual detective story. I frankly never throw away films I have spent money on - usually I just give it away to someone when I find I don't want it for my collection. However, this one hit the trash can with a muffled thump.",The Black Dahlia
190,dmanyc,The Blah Dahlia,2,29 September 2007,"Wow! How do you screw up a film based on an James Ellroy novel? Place it in the hands of Brian De Palma. The film looked nice but I had no friggin idea what was going on. This film was soooo slow I was wondering was it made by snails. And for a movie called The Black Dahlia, there wasn't much about The Black Dahlia in the film. You have a boxing match (Fire and Ice a.k.a. Lee and Bucky), two cops (Lee and Bucky) becoming partners, said cops hanging out with each other and with one of the cop's girl (Kay), a shootout that just happened to take place not far from where Elizabeth Short's body was found, a mobster being released, one cop (Lee) having a nervous breakdown and going after recently released mobster, other cop (Bucky) having a dalliance with a Short lookalike (Madeleine) then with his partner's girl (Kay), k.d. lang popping out of nowhere to perform in a tux (she sounded good, by the way), and on and on. I'm getting dizzy just writing this. By the time you finally get to the Elizabeth Short portion, you forgot she was suppose to be a major part of the film and you're staring at your watch or a clock nearby wondering when this film will end.As for the acting: whoever did the casting should be fired. Josh Hartnett is good-looking but looks too young and is bland in both his acting and his narration as Bucky. My roommate, who watched this with me on HBO, asked me if he was suppose to be the next Brad Pitt. Maybe Hollywood thinks so, but so far it's not working. You at least can remember films that Brad's been in (Thelma & Louise, Babel, Mr. & Mrs. Smith, etc.). Can anyone name even five films Hartnett's been in? How about three films? One film? Anyone? Exactly. Hilary Swank is too old for Madeleine. Why is it when when gets all tomboy on us like Million Dollar Baby or Boys Don't Cry she aces it, but when she glams up it's a disappointment? Aaron Eckhart is wasted as Lee. Scarlett Johansson looks good but not given a whole lot to do as Kay. I felt like Swank and Johansson should've switched roles.If you're looking for a good recent noir film, skip The Black Dahlia and stick with L.A. Confidental. THAT film should've won Best Picture, not that pathetic Romeo-and-Juliet-on-a-boat craptacular Titanic.",The Black Dahlia
191,IRateFilms,Great Director turns in an O.K. Film,6,17 September 2006,"Director Brian De Palma, whom we have not seen anything from in the past four years, treats us to a very authentic, yet underwhelming rendition of a film noir. Set in the late 1920's Black Dahlia sports the likes of Josh Hartnett, Scarlett Johansson, Hillary Swank and last but not least Aaron Eckhart. This does turn out to be a great combination, all with equally notable performances. Unfortunately Hartnett seems to look too much like a clean-cut country farm-boy to fully score the part of Officer ""Bucky"" Bleichert. Also, Johansson maybe has seen one too many of the films Black Dahlia mimics, and consequently her performance is synthetic at times. My applause go to Aaron Eckhart and Hillary Swank, never disappointing, or overacting in a movie that seemed to almost yearn it at times. They both nailed the bad cop and femme fatale roles like a coffin before burial. De Palma production and direction are, as always, excellent, along with his signature cinematography always taking itself above and beyond. The story itself could have been more captivating, but I am afraid this is another movie that got swallowed up in all of its glory. Like many movies before it and to come, The Black Dahlia was consumed by its high budget,and big names. This crime of The Black Dahlia may have gone down in history, but I do not think this movie will.",The Black Dahlia
192,LeroyBrown-2,Well crafted but ultimately confusing and almost incoherent film.,3,22 January 2009,"The movie ""The Black Dahlia"" is based on the novel of the same name by James Elroy. He also wrote the novel ""L.A. Confidential"" which was turned into one of my all time favorite movie. I'm such a big fan of that movie that it is one of the very few DVDs I own for which I paid full price. So I had high expectation for this movie, specially with Brian DePalma directing and Aaron Eckhart as one of the leads. However it turns out to be quite a disappointment.To begin with the story is not about ""The Black Dahlia"" murder exclusively. The movie would divert from the Elizabeth Short (aka The Black Dahlia) murder and would introduce characters and follow a story line involving them. As a matter of fact the titular murder does not occur until about one third of the way into the movie. By then we're introduced to the lead cops and their rather odd relationship with a woman. Later on we would be introduced to the family of a wealthy albeit sleazy real estate developer. Somewhere in the movie we see ex-cons that one of the cops have a vendetta against. Yet in the end the movie tries to tie up all this convoluted mess together. But it doesn't work. Some of the links are just too far fetch.The acting is another problem I have with this movie, Aaron Eckhart of course is an excellent actor but the two younger actors he had to play opposite are rather weak. Josh Hartnett and Scarlett Johansson. Hartnett, in my opinion is just not a very good actor and more than that he doesn't have the presence nor charisma to carry a film. Johansson on the other hand is rather bland and despite all the magazine covers she's just not as beautiful as say, a young Sharon Stone. Hillary Swank has proved she can act but her performance in this movie as a socialite just doesn't work. She has a fake accent and combine that with her attempt to act like a '40s screen siren, it's best that she leave this off her resume.The best thing about this movie is the craftsmanship and the look. The movie has a great look to it although a little neater than it should be, but it captured the atmosphere right. Mr. DePalma's positioning and movement of his camera is never in doubt. Witness the scene when the body of the Black Dahlia is discovered, just an excellent shot. Also when the coroner is examining and explaining the injury of poor Miss Short. All in all the movie introduced too many elements and try to bind it together in the end only to fail miserably. Also the acting was not very good, other than the look of the movie and the craftsmanship in the film-making there's really nothing to recommend.",The Black Dahlia
193,cheekyfilm,A mid-tier DePalma that's worth a watch,5,16 October 2021,"I think Josh Hartnett is a poor actor, but he's good in the role here, as a sort of naive simple-but-well-meaning super cop. Eckhart is a good foil to him, an explosive yet stoic character that you just can't get a bead on. All the actors are well cast and are directed well. Hilary Swank isn't great, with a terrible accent, but it works somehow. No one actor really stands out, it's a fine ensemble to me.Where it goes wrong is the plot. It is only incidently related to the Black Dhalia case. It more of an homage to 40s gumshoe crime noir with tons of locales, costumes, throwback accents and slang. It sort of meanders a bit, and is overlong also.This isn't De Palma's best. I enjoyed the watch but won't be returning.",The Black Dahlia

This is painful to watch, not even boring. Just sad like a dead animal on the road. You want to help it, but you know it's too late. Everyone looked uncomfortable, except for Hartnett who doesn't have the experience to realize the script sucked. The actors even smoke uncomfortably as if at any moment some enviro-terrorists might storm the sound stage with water pistols filled with kerosene and squirt them in the face. There was only one interesting scene when Bucky (Hartnett) goes tho the rich guy's house: it's a great five minutes on a truly worthless film. Avoid this mess, please.",The Black Dahlia
195,The_Defiant1,Too slow and the end isn't rewarding enough,6,30 September 2006,"The Black Dahlia moves too slowly and simply doesn't give a good enough payoff at the end to make the mystery compelling. Scarlett Johansson, an excellent actress outside of this film, delivers a cardboard character that could've been played by anyone. The movie flows so slowly that it's easy to become bored.This movie appears to be a throwback to simpler days of movie making. Unfortunately, the cheesy delivery of lines makes it difficult to immerse yourself into the story. You have time to ponder that nothing is being presented at face value, so the mystery isn't so mysterious by the time the end comes around. There are clues all along that people aren't who they seem to be. De Palma fans will likely be disappointed despite the formula being very true to his style. The only real mystery is that aspects of the plot are saved until the end. Otherwise, there is no mystery why scenes were included. The transition of scenes added to the predictability.Creatively this movie suffers because it tries to deliver a 1940's movie with modern sexuality and no sophistication. It's okay for a lazy Saturday matinée, but avoid paying full price to see this.",The Black Dahlia
196,dragonshield,"An honestly horrible screenplay, leaving you with an overall bad taste in your mouth",3,10 May 2007,"Directed by Brian De Palma, starring Josh Hartnett, Scarlett Johansson, Aaron Eckhart and Hilary Swank. A great director and an amazing cast, so you can't go wrong with that now can you? Yes, you definitely can. This movie is bad. Although it has its own moments, those moments aren't the saving grace for me the film itself.The directing honestly isn't half bad, it's De Palma after all. Actually, it's one of the few things that are enjoyable in this film. But then when it comes to the screenplay, now that's the part where to movie goes wrong, totally wrong. I haven't read the original bestseller novel by James Ellroy, but as it's been a bestseller, I'd think it has been good as well. Well actually, when you think about it, all the elements and all the stuff in this film would actually work better in a book instead of a movie, but it's the screenplay which messes it up after all. Despite that, the movie's just plain boring and too long, and the whole progress is too slow. There is so much irrelevant things in it that it just brings my nerves to a boil. The movie starts off good and interesting, but after 30 minutes you're wondering ""What does this all got to do with anything?"" and then it's just downhill after that, all the way to the bottom and below that. Especially the last 30 minutes are a real pain to watch, as you're just yelling ""Why can't this movie end?"" And it just keeps on going with a destination that you just don't care about anymore.What comes to role performances I think they're pretty convincing, but it still doesn't make the movie itself anything worth watching. There's a little bit ""over the top"" -acting at a few parts, but overall the role performances left me a pretty good taste in my mouth. They're not anything phenomenal, but they're nice, sort of decent. Everyone does their job, so no complaints about that. The whole essence of 1940's has been captured pretty well, the dressing and that overall feeling of it. But still, there are some things that go wrong. I haven't lived in the 1940's but I still now a few things about it and there are these things that just doesn't go like they're supposed to. Overall, the movie's set decorators and designers have managed themselves well enough and they've really put some time and effort for making the movie look like it is and it looks good. So, they deserve a plus from that.Despite from my effort for trying to find something to compliment about this movie, the things mentioned above are pretty much what I'm capable of. This movie, bear with me, isn't worth watching. Nothing near it. The screenplay's just so bad the whole story is a bunch of mess, trying to be clever, but the only thing it manages is to be boring and dull, also way too long. Pieces of the puzzle just do not connect together, the movie doesn't have any flow and it includes so irrelevant, unnecessary and useless scenes that it just makes you uncomfortable in watching the movie. I have to admit that this movie has potential in being something much better, but depressingly it doesn't use that potential at all. This is, all in all, a bad movie.",The Black Dahlia

198,scrapmetal7,unsuccessful attempt at an admittedly difficult novel,5,9 October 2006,"synopsis: Immediate Post-WWII Los Angeles: Bucky (Hartnett) and Lee (Eckhart) are two ex-boxers and cops, partners and best friends, who are pulled from their regular assignment tracking down warrants to investigate the brutal murder of a young woman. Their personal relationship falls apart as each becomes obsessed, in his own way and for his own reasons, with solving the case.review: The good points: The cast is outstanding. Josh Hartnett and Aaron Eckhart are exactly right as the boxing policemen. Eckhart has the right mixture of ambition, likability, and shiftyness before he even opens his mouth, and Hartnett shows Bucky's sadness, hope, and altruism without ever being too obvious or heavy-handed.(There have been reviewers who've taken him to task for this, but don't buy into that. It is a syndrome of movie reviewers to be cruel when leads turn in understated performances, but that is exactly what the character demands in this case. To really asses Hartnett's performance, consider that he is on screen in every single scene, and the movie does not suffer for this at all.) All of Scarlet Johansen's lines sound like lines in a movie, but that is the screenwriters' fault for writing her bad lines. Otherwise, she is radiant, if appearing too perfect to have had a sordid past.The real standout, however, is Mia Kirschner as Elizabeth Short, the murdered woman. Seen in only a few movie audition reels and one blue film, she is riveting and heartbreaking. You cannot take your eyes off of her. It is only in those black and white reels that the movie actually touches on the tragedy of the story with any effectiveness.The movie's biggest problem is in how many ways it misses it's opportunities. The story itself is grand and horrific, full of tragedy, human failing, and horror, but the movie is unable to mine any of these resources effectively. Various dubious choices were made, and none of them pay off; the movie leads in too quickly, and almost every scene is too short, becoming a series of snapshots. The timespan of the story, starting from the finding of the murdered woman's body to the film's end, is compressed to little over a week, although a couple months worth of things seem to happen. Curiously, the characters often reference the exact number of days as they pass. First-person narration is employed, which rarely adds anything to a film, and does not do much for this one.And, there is a real lack of DARING, most obviously in how the film shies away from the story's inherent violence. The ""Zoot Suit"" riots that open the film seem like comedy relief, far from the real chaos and terror of the actual events. The LAPD seems to be a bunch of bumbling old fellas in trenchcoats, rather than fairly rough and street-smart, pre-PC ex-military types prone to their share of vice, most of them boring rather than morally ambiguous. There's no danger in the main or background characters when there should be plenty in all of them.The murder itself is the pitch darkness at the end of the story's tunnel, the most horrific of its many horrific aspects, yet it's dramatization in the end is just a throwaway expository scene which leaves no impact at all.In terms of the film's style and atmosphere, the sets are right, the characters have the right look and are well cast, but the tone is fairly monotone. The film is not suspenseful or scary when it should be, not chaotic when it should be, and with the exception of Mia Kirchner's scenes, not sad or gripping when it should be. As a film adaptation of a very scary and epic story, it is never scary and never at all grand in scope.The score is obtrusive and unwelcome, constantly and unnecessarily reminding us that we're watching a '40's murder mystery, with the noir trumpets and sad piano almost constantly running in the background when silence would have been much more effective.Finally, the ""DePalma touches""; for all his hype, based on one or two films from 30 years ago, DePalma always seems to come off as something of a clown behind the camera, often going tongue in cheek when it's not called for, as if at a loss. At various times in the film, the featured extras all look like they're posing, as if extras in a stage musical rather than a film. A gaudy murder set-piece in the 2nd half is pure DePalma, which means it seems a little tongue-in-cheek and silly, and generally out of place. One wonders what David Lynch or Abel Ferarra, or any director who's proved able to mix real drama with real chills, could have done with the story.Also, reading the novel gives the reader a vivid image of Elizabeth Short as a confused, desperate young dreamer, a very humane and honest portrayal of her and her sad and short life, all revealed in the investigation by Lee and Bucky, an investigation which barely even happens in the movie. In this way, the novel does her justice and makes her murder, which was real, genuinely sad and horrifying. The makers of the Black Dahlia movie unfortunately had no such interest in Elizabeth Short, and have cruelly used her to little effect, no less then she was used by people who didn't care about her when she lived.",The Black Dahlia
199,cornflakeboy20,over-the-top mess,5,16 September 2006,"Anybody expecting to get a great account of the Black Dahlia case, even fictional, will be disappointed going in to this movie. Of course, I knew that it was a fictionalization of the case, but I had no idea the movie would present its own evidence and draw its own conclusions.But the main problem here is not the lack of factual detail, so much as the confusion of plot that surrounds and overwhelms the Black Dahlia case itself. So much plot and character and sideplots and backstory are built around the central characters that the case itself seems like a distraction. A key plot point and character motivator is the fascination of the two detectives with the murder, but this is never elaborated enough in the film, and we're left to half-heartedly guess at the character motivations.The tone is never consistently campy, but when the camp arrives it overwhelms the story. A dinner scene between a suspect and her family had the crowd in stitches (the only scene during which the audience laughed). The problem is that the scene is valuable to the plot and should never have been played for laughs. Hitchcock or even Lynch could have shot the same scene, with the same events and dialogue, and made it menacing and creepy, which it needed to be to function in the mystery.Other problems: De Palma uses the lesbian angle of the movie (never a part of the case) to full exploitative advantage, and the actresses seem unable to master to the expressive 1940s style acting that would have come naturally to even a marginal 40s star.Although the film brings a clearcut finale rather than a vague puzzle, too many loose threads come together too neatly and rather than bringing the film to a satisfactory conclusion, it leaves you scratching your head, is this what I spent the last 2 hours waiting to hear? Overall, there is too much plot, too little character development and a wildly uneven tone. The movie has its moments but it's a blinding mess all together.",The Black Dahlia
200,mikhalt,Review,9,23 September 2006,This movie has Scarlett in it I have to for sure to a review on this one. I like her role in the Island. So Yeh this movie is about an actress being murdered and the cops finding out. It is set around the time of the 1940's in Los Angeles of course. The tapestry of characters in this movie look pretty unique. This was a famous murder case that happened years ago. So I wouldn't mind seeing this movie. Especially with the backdrop of the 1940's I mean those times rocked. I am assuming this movie has violent and such scenes. So its not a family film to give you the head start on that one. So get yourselves ready and enjoy this movie. Hope my review helps.,The Black Dahlia
201,brodie_kashmir,"Pointless, misguided, but Hartnett has come into his own and it's a wonder to look at",6,31 December 2006,"Brian De Palma has been a maestro of modern film noir. From ""The Untouchables"" to ""L.A. Confidential"", even ""Mission: Impossible"" showing glimpses of noir. But with his new entry into the genre, ""The Black Dahlia"", starring Josh Hartnett, Aaron Eckhart, Scarlett Johansson and Hilary Swank and set in 1947 Hollywood, he misses, but just barely.Hartnett and Eckhart play two boxer/cops assigned to the grizzly murder of Elizabeth Short (Mia Kirshner), an aspiring actress who was found in a field carved and disemboweled. Twists, turns and sub-plots fly in the who-done-it, with the prerequisite femme fatales being Johansson as Eckhart's loving girlfriend and Swank as an acquaintance of Short, who also happens to be the daughter of one of the more influential men in Hollywood.It's hard to come up with a more cohesive and in-depth plot summary for various reasons. I don't want to give too much away. I barely understood it myself. And, by fault of De Palma or editor Bill Pankow or writer Josh Friedman, the story is so convoluted that it would take an entirely separate article to explain it. It's an interesting story to be told, it was just told poorly. And I don't know who to blame. It had wonderful dialogue, and when I was able to follow the plot, I could. There was nothing too inherently wrong with the editing as it was. Nice even cuts and it flowed nicely. I can't think of a better modern director to handle this type of film. But it was one, or all of those, which contributed to the downfall of what could have been a fantastic film, a true breakout for Hartnett. I just can't figure out who to blame for the poor storytelling. All the wrong portions of the story were told, some left unresolved.In this day and age, classic film-noir style walks the very fine line of parody and sincerity. And ""Dahlia"" went back and forth. Eckhart's Det. Blanchard seemed almost a goofy stereotype of 40's cops, while Hartnett's Det. Bleichert was as hard nosed as they come, challenging Humphrey Bogart for noir supremacy. The entire cast, really, handled the somewhat archaic style of acting without making it seem too hokey.The acting is top notch all the way through. Hartnett has settled quite comfortably into this style, as his past three major films (""Sin City"", ""Lucky Number Slevin"" and now ""Dahlia"" have been of this genre and its sub-genres.) He was an actor I had originally written off in the late 90's as a pin-up boy with no real talent other than to look good on screen. But he shows some real charm and chops on screen when playing a style. He's one of those young actors that will come up and join the ranks of the more prominent and serious actors, and major awards are in his future, that's my prediction anyway.But the true center of attention of this film is the sheer visual beauty of it. Credit should go to both Hungarian cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond for paying homage to the classic noir films and Italian Oscar-winning production designer Dante Ferretti (2005 for ""The Aviator"") for accurately and beautifully rendering the look of 1947 Hollywood(land). Zsigmond used the classic tricks of the trade to his advantage, and made a compelling and stark contrast between the feminine and the masculine characters by altering the focus to be softer on the females, making them appear angelic till true motives and intentions are revealed.Ferretti was the only one to bring the new millennium into the classically stylized film. He made it more graphic and gory than what would have been shown in '47. I urge the weak stomached to stay away.",The Black Dahlia
202,Rick-34,Disappointing (weak possible spoiler without details),4,23 September 2006,"I went into this film with high expectations based on a) having read and enjoyed the book by James Ellroy b) having seen and enjoyed LA Confidential, a great film based on another Ellroy book and c) having an enormous deal of respect for Scarlett Johannson and Hillary Swank, the two female leads.With all that in hand, I was really quite disappointed in the film. There were two major problems with the film: the convoluted plot and the weak acting by the male leads. Neither problem was present in LA Confidential, and it's worth considering what happened. Ellroy's stories are notoriously convoluted. He writes byzantine plots that involve a lot of characters and apparently disjoint strands of action that somehow end up being related to each other. Somehow this problem was finessed in LA Confidential: the plot was drastically simplified and trimmed to fit the screen. Also the twists and turns, although not predictable, made sense. Even the novel of Black Dahlia doesn't wrap up quite so neatly. The strength of the novel lies in just how deeply the investigator(s) become obsessed with the investigation of what might ordinarily be considered just another random homicide. The actual denouement in the novel doesn't make all that much sense, but it does somewhat, and in novel time it takes years to be worked out. The film glosses over all of the time issues, compressing the story (which is reasonable, given the change of medium), but it fails badly to motivate the psychological obsessions involved. And worse, rather than taking the lead from LA Confidential of drastically simplifying the denouement, it leaves it relatively intact. (I think one key twist was added, but I'm not sure since it's been above five years since I read the book.) For those who hadn't read the book, it must have been baffling. I found it unconvincing. One of the key problems here is that mystery movies work best when the viewers can puzzle along with the characters and see how the mystery is unraveled. Black Dahlia doesn't work that way: you have characters confessing to things out of the blue before the audience has any reason to find them suspicious. I blame Brian De Palma. I was reminded of his weaker films and how they get bogged down in over-complications and his fetish for unexplained and unexpected twists.All of these problems might have been tolerable if the lead actors had not been so dreary. Aaron Eckhardt has some ability, but he indulges in absurd overacting in this film. And Josh Hartnett wanders across the screen reciting lines in a horribly unconvincing fashion. This was the first Hartnett film I'd seen and I think it will be the last time I see him in a leading role. He just cannot carry a film. I had to think it was the weakest acting in a lead role I'd seen in a long time. And then I remembered that the previous film when I'd felt that way was De Palma's Body Double.Scarlett Johannson and Hillary Swank are wasted in roles that do not test their abilities. Swank in particular seems miscast as the spoiled society girl consorting with gigolos. I think they might have done better if they'd traded roles. Swank seems more like a cop's girlfriend and Johannson definitely would seem more at ease playing the spoiled society girl.On the whole I cannot recommend this film. Perhaps someday a remake will be made with the same basic story, but with a better screenplay and lead actors who can actually emote convincingly.

Josh Hartnett is flat and flat-out boring as ""Bucky"" Bleichert, a walking cliché of every film noir cop ever made. As the Black Dahlia herself, Mia Kirschner gave an interesting performance, but at times it did not seem like this movie was even about her character.The storyline was confusing and convoluted, the sets were so dark that at times it was hard to tell what was going on, and the film moved slower than molasses.Bottom line, if you want to see a great film noir with amazing performances, watch LA Confidential.

Every aspect of this adaptation of Ellroy's novel is awful and to make matters worse you are forced to endure this exhibition for over two hours. Even the turgid Hollywoodland looks good by comparison; no small task for a film with the energy of burnt out light bulb. Even the look of the picture is tepid with only a handful of the director's previous visual flourishes evident and they are spread out across the film's lenghty frame. Hartnett was far better in the only one tick above average ""Lucky Number Slevin"" and it seems as if Aaron Eckhardt is light years away from his solid work in ""Thank You For Smoking.""

I love Brian De Palmas films, Scarface, Carlito's Way, and his other crime classics and sense I love to look at true-crime stories, the Black Dahlia caught my eye. But I was highly disappointed.The Black Dahlia tells the story of a detective on the trail of the killer of Elizabeth Short, an aspiring actress. The movie is based on the book of the same name by James Elroy. I thought this would be a true story but it wasn't, just a fictionalized account of the investigation (that isn't what was bad about it).Hilary Swank gave a horrid performance and so did the other actors in the film. I don't even know if De Palma actually directed this, he has directed some of the greatest actors in Hollywood (Sean Connery, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Michelle Phiefer). How could he have fell so low directing this?",The Black Dahlia

Confidential, but, considering that was, in my view, the best film of the 1990's, that's okay.I'm biased toward the Black Dahlia because I am enamored with that era for movies. It could have been better had the cinematography captured the L.A. scene of that time period more in keeping with L.A. Conf. Nevertheless, I thought the acting was solid.Scarlett Johansson was the perfect Kay Lake. Gorgeous. Vulnerable. A toughness underneath. There was not really a bad performance in the lot.I am surprised at the large number of ""1's"" given for this movie. It has to relate to some expectation that was not met - to a complete misunderstanding of what the movie was all about. This often happens. Either it was too gruesome for some (I thought it was about as tempered as possible given what is in the book) or it was the ""gore"" movie by which they expected to be titillated.Nevertheless, if you enjoy Film Noir, you will enjoy Black Dahlia.Makes me want to watch LAC again.",The Black Dahlia
209,mattbaxter72,What a waste,4,7 August 2007,"Paul McCartney once said that if some video directors saw the phrase 'Lord Privy Seal' in the lyrics, they would shoot a lord, a privy and a seal. That is exactly the mentality at work in this movie, a drearily literal-minded attempt at filming James Ellroy's brilliant novel.It's one of those twisty-turny noir things, where someone (the Black Dahlia of the title) has been killed, and pretty much everyone is a suspect, and everyone is up to their necks in corruption and sleaze. You may be thinking that this sort of thing was done before, in a little movie called LA Confidential, and you may be right. This movie tries to copy that film, so much so that it almost seems as though Brian DePalma was looking at the wrong script in some places. You've got the two chalk-and-cheese cops, you've got the platinum-blonde ex-hooker, you've got police brutality and corruption, you've got everything short of Kevin Spacey getting shot halfway through.And that, right there, is half the reason this doesn't work. Kevin Spacey isn't in this one. Neither is Russell Crowe, or Guy Pearce, or James Cromwell, or any really good actors at all, it seems. Instead we get Josh Hartnett as a twelve-year-old boy who's playing at being a cop, Hilary Swank trying to channel the spirit of Marlene Dietrich and failing hilariously, and Aaron Eckhart being, as usual, amiable but kinda dull. The supporting cast are generally dire, too, but special mention must go to Fiona Shaw. I hope her performance was meant as a joke.The fault, though, doesn't rest entirely with the actors. A case in point is Scarlett Johannsen, a brilliant, expressive actress in the right hands (see The Prestige, if you haven't already, for an example of how much she can convey without saying a word). She's dreadful here, though, there's no other word for it, but what can she do with no good lines, and a clichéd character who's given only the most perfunctory storyline? There are times when the camera lingers on her for as much as ten seconds at a time, and all she can do is stand there with a fixed, rictus expression on her face. Even the best actors would wilt under such terrible direction and editing. Only Mia Kirshner, as the Dahlia herself, rises above the direction, and that's because she doesn't appear as part of the main film at all, but only in black-and-white films-within-a-film, which are edited and directed much better than the main movie here.Technically, the film is very good, and all the period details are in place and correct. But the story just wanders and meanders and then wanders a bit more for the first half hour - at which point someone evidently shouted 'get on with it' and so everything goes to warp speed, and starts moving far too fast.Few things are worse than betrayed expectations. I really thought DePalma was the right man to film this great book, but he made a horrible mess of it from start to finish. As for the writer, Josh Friedman, he really needs to give this game up. He's messed up The War Of The Worlds, and now he's screwed up this one, too, converting Ellroy's world-weary cynicism to a bunch of people sitting round a dinner table saying 'Isn't this nice?' over and over, until I wanted to hit them all with a brick. Try imagining Russell Crowe and Kim Basinger saying 'Isn't this nice?' about fifteen times each. Not easy, is it? In short, get LA Confidential, get Chinatown, read everything you can find by James Ellroy, and don't ever see this worthless movie.",The Black Dahlia
210,loydmooney-1,a messerpiece,3,21 September 2006,"De Palmas best after Carrie, which ain't saying much. In fact right from the start you sense he is camera crazy, wheeling it hither and yon down this street and that to catch this wild fight that has virtually nada to do with an economic plot.Somebody should tell all these guys that just because a camera has wheels, it is usually better left standing still, and no tracking shots over 10 feet, otherwise, excess and madness. Which this movie is, in spades. One shot that does work beautifully, had it fitted into the jigsaw puzzle better is the one that climbs up over the building past the crows to show a car driving away after the body is dumped, just before the gunfight. When you find out it really makes no sense down the line other than a convenient coincidence, well. But it is a striking shot. The scene where the mother killer blows her brains out is wonderfully done with a few exceptions: even most of that is totally ridiculous, very convenient for the cop to be able to come through the window, find the head of the daughter on dad's lap and the whole crew there dutifully ready to pour out their guilt a la Perry Mason, I did it, no I did it, I plunged the knife through the heart before the poison took place, no I did it cause I had the kid of the ....well you get the point just about like The Black Dahlia did, right across your smiling mouth. That said, how Ma begins to rant away at the top of the stairs and her lungs like the mad mother in Long Days Journey into Night, could, and only mind you, could have been fantastic. Instead it is just more more lump of bad meat in this smelly stew. As for the end, my god talk about copulating clichés, the long drawing out and shooting of Hillary Swank, embarrassing. Harken back to the wonderful knives coming at the mother in Carrie: spectacular and horrifying and marvelous. De Palma just is not up to the task of anything very real: fantasy with horror is is specialty, looks like. Certainly his Hitch fascination has always been his supreme weakness. Though here dunno exactly whom he is trying to go for. That whole business of Hillary donning a man's hat with a knife to kill the buddy of the main cop and then the cremation on the spot, that is beyond ludicrous. Just a mess. From beginning to end. Have no idea what any of them were planning once the cameras started to roll. No, was gonna give this a five, but what's the matter with me. 3. That's the ticket.",The Black Dahlia
211,tigerman2001,"A mess. De Palma stole two hours of my life, among other crimes committed...",1,28 June 2010,"I don't know where to begin. In some ways it'd be easier just to sum up by saying ""what?! like, what the hell, dude?,"" because it's hard to begin or end thoughts about a film that seemed to have neither beginning nor (in more ways than one) end. For that matter, the sandwich-oriented two-word review alleged in the classic ""This Is Spinal Tap"" would be entirely appropriate.The positive: it's nicely shot.The negative: everything else.The acting's okay in parts but I can safely say all the principals have been better in other properties. The script and direction conspire to make this an incomprehensible mess, one that also has pretty much nothing at all to do with the reality of the Black Dahlia case (so much so, in fact, that I don't see any point at all in including that murder, let alone naming the film in its honor). Not having anything to do with the the actual case would be okay, really, if the film had at least one thing worth recommending other than the catchy title and the promise inherent in the same (an unsolved and very sensational murder; ""Zodiac"" did that very well).At the 84-minute mark, despite having yet to make any sense of this monumental pile of ego-driven self-indulgent crap, I thought perhaps some kind of blessed conclusion to the film was imminent. But, no; sadly, I had another 26 or so minutes left to endure. Admittedly, about 20 minutes later the story started to resolve itself just a little, although Frau Blücher (""whinnnnnnyyyy"") delivering her demented soliloquy didn't exactly act to clarify anything, but when the film finally lurched to the glorious sight of a fade-to-black I was still left wondering what, exactly, I'd just watched.I'm not saying that films should always spoonfeed us the plot, or that a non-traditional narrative or one that's more than a little off-kilter or nonlinear doesn't have worth when executed well, but this film just plain makes (almost) no sense right from the start and proudly never lets up with its puerile nonsense. I have a feeling that the hour De Palma cut from his original print would almost certainly not explain more but, rather, would merely increase the length of an audience's suffering, perhaps finding new ways to totally lose even the most careful follower of whatever it is that in this case stands in for narrative. It's enough to make Richard Simmons frown. I mean, it's really BAD.""LA Confidential"" covers some of the same ground and is not only a more successful attempt at a modern, color ode to film noir but features a story that actually makes sense and characters that we might actually care about or at least see as human archetypes. If you want to approximate this trainwreck of a film without actually exposing yourself to its corrosive nastiness (nastiness is fine, in its place, but in this case it's redeemed by, well, NOTHING), play the ""LA Confidential"" DVD backwards while listening to ""Revolution #9"" frontwards and banging yourself on the head with a rolled up copy of ""Pretentious Auteur"" magazine. De Palma has made some good films; this is most definitely not one of them. In fact, this is the film that should be shown to all who aspire to celluloid creativity so that they might learn from the errors of Brian's ways and, we hope, not inflict upon us the horror of anything remotely like this film getting a big budget and wide release despite being several steps below ""Sweet Movie"" in terms of palatability and comprehensibility. And, predictably, some who actually claim to have found worth in this waste of money, talent, and film stock seem to assume that they're privy to some truth that eludes the ignorant hoi polloi who dismiss the piece (these are possibly some of the same people who liked ""Heaven's Gate""); De Palma's massively expensive joke is on them.Ugh.",The Black Dahlia
212,create,It's not about solving the murder. It's why the murder went unsolved.,6,15 September 2006,"The case of the Black Dahlia was one of those notorious murders that, if committed today, would inspire several docudramas about a popular suspect believed to have committed the murder. It would be a sure fire ratings getter with all the sexual intrigue, lost moral values, and pure depravity that the murder represents. It would have been cast with a perky girl next door type as the victim, and two square-jawed action dudes as the straight-arrow Columbos who bag the bad guy.If this is the film you were planning on seeing, then Black Dahlia will disappoint you. This film is based upon a book, that is loosely based upon the Betty Short killing--a crime that saw no one charged before the public. Brian DePalma and the writers, James Elroy and Josh Friedman, focus their attention more on the minds fascinated with this murder, than they do on the potential suspects. As a result, the filmmakers seem to be committing on a society that spends too much time trying to solve these unsolvable headline grabbers; and ignores preventable crimes like child molestation and police corruption. A society that is so frustrated by life that it has become titillated by this girl's death. And who are the two citizen's most frustrated? That would be Bucky Bliechert (Josh Hartnett) and Lee Blanchard (Arron Eckhard)Bucky and Lee are partners on the LA force. They are sort of famous for having put on a good show in a boxing match. Lee is the loose cannon on the force, who is always working the side angles. Bucky is the cop that likes to punch out the baddies. Now, in a brazenly stupid move on the commissioner's part, they are assigned the Black Dahlia case. It is a stupid move because Bucky and Lee are involved in a love triangle with the Scarlett Johansson character, Kay. Anyone who would hand the case to two guys who would be obviously distracted by Scarlett Johansson had better have his head examined. Predictably, Kay becomes a distraction. But she is not the only one. Lee's obsession with the case, and his other personality problems also waste time. Bucky, unable to solve major crimes, or get in the bed with Kay; puts his efforts in converting a lesbian: Madeleine (Hillary Swank). All of this takes a great amount of time. In the meantime, the case goes cold.This is perfect material for De Palma. His best movies tend to focus on characters who are over the top--the most obvious cases were Al Pacino's Scarface or Sean Penn's Sgt. in Casualties of War. Dahlia, however is played in a more serious bent, like Carrie or Blow Out. Bucky and Lee are too pathetic to be rousing fun like the Cuban drug lord. The more you get to know their characters, the more you dislike them. Only Hillary Swank's Madeleine tries to chew the scenery.This is a very dense, noir film. It is similar to the Maltese Falcoln in several ways. It focuses less on the object of the audience's desire--in the case of Black Dahlia that would be finding the murderer--and more on the stilted characters of the film. None of the characters are likable, but they all have great lines.In the end, you'll know if you enjoyed the film by which side of this parable you find yourself: Is discovering Betty Short's killer a waste of time, or did the cops waste the public's time in not charging anyone with the murder.",The Black Dahlia
213,roger-pettit1,A very disappointing film,3,6 October 2012,"Oh, dear! ""The Black Dahlia"" is one of the worst films that I have seen in a long time. It boasts a strong cast on paper and a director, Brian de Palma, with a very good reputation. But it's a dull and frequently incomprehensible film that left me very disappointed. Adapted from a novel of the same name (which I haven't read) by the American writer of noir fiction, James Ellroy, the plot is based on an incident that actually took place. It concerns the gruesome murder in the 1940s of a minor Hollywod star, Betty Ann Short (Mia Kirshner). Ms Short was also known as 'The Black Dahlia'. The crime is investigated by two police officers, Lee Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) and Dwight 'Bucky' Bleichert (Josh Hartnett). Blanchard is married to Kay (Scarlett Johansson). Bleichert develops a relationship with Madeleine (Hilary Swank), who is a member of a very high-profile and influential family. Madeleine knew 'The Black Dahlia' and is therefore a crucial figure in the police investigation. The film is actually more about the lives of Blanchard and Bleichert than the murder itself. Just about everything about ""The Black Dahlia"" is below par. Superficially, it looks good. The costumes are first-rate, for example. But dig a little deeper and the visual weaknesses are all too apparent. The vaguely sepia cinematic tint is off-putting and many of the scenes are simply unconvincing in that they too readily make the viewer aware that they have been shot in a film studio. There is an air of unreality about them. That is particularly true of the opening few minutes of the film. In addition, the narrative clarity is poor. ""The Black Dahlia"" is a very wordy film. Its plot and character development are heavily dependent on a voice-over that leaves much to be desired in terms of comprehensibility. The content of some of the narration seems to contradict itself and is frequently difficult to follow. What is more, the conclusion of the film is, not to mince words, completely incomprehensible and illogical. I have no confidence whatsoever that I understand what actually happened and why. While some of that may well be ascribable to inattention and poor concentration on my part, I think the screenplay is at fault too. 'The Black Dahlia' is a very confusing film. Despite the stellar cast, the acting is little better. None of the stars acquits themselves well. Overacting abounds. And to cap it all, there is very little sense of tension or suspense. A poor film. 3/10.",The Black Dahlia

215,gvb0907,A Tragedy Reduced to a Travesty,1,22 September 2006,"The main problem with filming any James Ellroy novel is what to cut. In ""LA Confidential"" Curtis Hanson did a great job of trimming the story to its essentials while still retaining much of Ellroy's style and tone. Unfortunately, in ""The Black Dahlia"" Brian De Palma has moved in the opposite direction, delivering a staggeringly bloated, over-produced, chaotic and convoluted work, turning what was the simplest and most straight-forward of Ellroy's LA Quartet books into a nearly incomprehensible film.The Dahlia case has never been solved, which has led to a flood of true crime speculations, novels, and films, all which pose solutions to the mystery of who killed Elizabeth Short. These range from the credible to the ridiculous, but whatever their conclusions their success or failure depends upon how they build their case. There's something to be said for misdirection, especially if one is working in fiction, but De Palma's method of presenting the story is so oblique that by the time he arrives at a resolution you'll no longer care and most likely you'll laugh. And that seems terribly inappropriate, for the Dahlia case is not the stuff of black comedy.From the very beginning one senses De Palma is off track when he stages a clumsy depiction of the Zoot Suit riot of 1943 (the Dahlia was murdered in 1947). This does nothing to advance the story other than to explain how LAPD detectives Bucky Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) and Lee Blanchard (Aaron Eckert) first met, something that could have been done just as well and far more economically via a voice-over, but De Palma wants to take you over the top, even if he has to stumble to do so. The sequence where Blanchard and Bleichert box, which steals shamelessly from Scorcese's ""Raging Bull"", is more of the same. Of course borrowings have always been integral to De Palma's style, which only points to the poverty of his own.By the time Elizabeth Short (Mia Kirshner) meets her gruesome fate, the aftermath of which initially serves only as a backdrop, the film is bogged down amidst the two detectives' strange relationship with Kay Lake (Scarlett Johansson), the impending release of an obscure hood named Bobbie DeWitt, and a shoot-out that comes out of nowhere. The boys are swiftly transferred to the Dahlia case, but then drift in different directions. Blanchard seems to go obsessively crazy, while Bleichert is diverted by slumming, poor-rich-girl Madeleine Linscott (Hillary Swank), who eventually brings her catch home to meet the gallery of monsters known as her family.There's plenty of period detail (not always accurate; e.g., STOP signs were yellow then, not red), fancy camera work, and stylish sets and costumes (much of which would seem to be out of the financial reach of the principals), but neither the characters nor the story lines are compelling. Bleichert finally gets to the bottom of the mess, though not many people will find either his path or the resolution remotely convincing. James Ellroy's novel deserves a better treatment and Elizabeth Short's memory deserves more respect (she didn't make stag films), but directors like De Palma don't understand novelists' vision or the value of restraint. As a result we have films that feature elaborate trappings, shallow performances, and showy direction, rather than ones offering genuine depth and compassion. There were nine people in the theater when I sat down to watch ""The Black Dahlia"" yesterday afternoon. An hour later only three remained. Those who left made the better decision.",The Black Dahlia
216,blindredemption,"""Look i talk like i'm in an old school Detective film""",4,11 June 2007,"What a shame that this movie became what it did. I really was hoping for a decent thriller, suspense film, but it came out as an old detective styled crime movie about Josh Harnett and his love affair with some girls, and some how it all gets linked up to the Black Dahlia murder case.If De Palma took this script back to the drawing board with his associates he could have a great movie. There are a few things that make this movie fall flat.1. like telling us your theory on who actually killed Ms. Short is not what we came to see (or at least i didn't). This case was never solved, that's what makes the whole thing a great idea for a film, like great give us a theory of who COULD of killed Ms. Short, don't actually tell us who. To me that really ruined the movie's overall. But wait there's more.2. Since the script was mediorce at best, the actors are only going to give a mediorce performance at best. Now i don't mind any of these actors in all of the other films i've seen them in. Harnett was good in ""Resurecting the Champ"" & ""Lucky Number Slevin"". Eckhart is fantastic in ""Thank you for Smoking"" ""Erin Brockovich"" and the rest of the cast is good in their other films. So it's a shame to see every single character do this over-the-top, ""Hey look at me, i can talk like i'm in old time detective film"" typed performance. Thumbs down for everyone.And 3. this can be tied into the script of course, but the Crazy amounts of Narration and Voice Overs. it was ridiculous, i wanted to fight the script writers after this movie.Like i said, if they had just taken the script back to the drawing board and gave us a more opened movie, and giving each character a personality that wasn't a detective the film could have been something.

Even with flashbacks, it was not clear what was actually going on some of the time, and Josh Hartnett's character never really seemed to come alive. I liked the performances of the two female stars, but Kay's motivation in particular was not made clear. And it is fair to say, as others have said, that it was not clear what the film was focussing on.

218,Weredegu,Alert: underrating observed,9,24 March 2007,"I don't know what it is with this film that made so many people trash it, really. I'm normally quite critical with films I see, and most often a bad film just makes me not comment on it. It may fall within the 'too bad' category, and then I may feel an urge to vent my anger about it, but more often than not I'll review films that I liked for some reason. And here I am, reviewing 'The Black Dahlia', and it's definitely not from the too-bad category.The cinematography is great. Vilmos Zsigmond has done a great job, and I'm not saying that only because he's my fellow Hungarian. The at times deliberately non-sharp close-up on the actresses' face here and there for classic effect, as well as the First Person Shooter mode used in capturing some of the scenes from Josh Hartnett's point of view all work well, beside the regularly well-done cinematography. De Palma might have had ideas influencing this, of course: with films we're always talking about team work and team achievement. However, Zsigmond could still have easily got the Oscar for his performance. And once we say that, it doesn't matter that he eventually hasn't. The acting is good also. At times there is deliberate over-acting, characters turned from time to time into caricatures of themselves, but that's the special type of humor that goes well with the film noir genre - again, also a question of directing, I think. So, while not forgetting about De Palma's merits, the young four - Mia Kirshner, Josh Hartnett, Scarlett Johansson and Hilary Swank -, they all come up with very appreciable performances indeed. Especially Mia Kirshner is mesmerizing in her forsaken role at times. And Scarlett Johansson looks very much like an actress from the era, even while the character she plays is actually not even one of the wannabe actresses in the story.",The Black Dahlia

Gorgeous styling, not just evoking, but recreating a noir genre and capturing an honest, studied essence of the Los Angeles of yore. Interesting, but the film captures Los Angeles more than 'Hollywood'; but at its core, we found that there was something essentially lacking in the composition of characters we are introduced to in this flick.After much consideration, we've determined that while de Palma fans will love this picture, we found that in the end there was no redemption. All the loose threads tie up, but there is no sympathetic character, we don't care about anyone, and there is no overwhelming humanity we were able to relate to in any single character's story.So we left the screening thinking yeah? Right? That was it? Since we didn't read the novel, we're not sure whether the film was true to it or not, but while the iconic Black Dahlia story is an enduring Hollywood mystery, it's somewhat secondary, symbolic and iconic in terms of its position in this film's story.One great performance: Fiona Shaw as the rich man's wife. Genius. And Hillary Swank ain't half-bad as the femme fatale. But at the end of the day we found Josh Hartnett about 5 years too young for us to completely buy his story.

It's just as empty, dull and impossible to relate to as the people moving in it.Okay, the whole old world, especially in the beginning sequence, creates some sparkles in this cinematic swamp but that's about it.

223,pax03,"kind of weird, don't know what to think of it.",7,2 October 2006,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie. I saw a trailer at my friends house one night and didn't know it was coming out pretty soon after that so I decided to go home and check out what I could find on the release and whether I would be seeing it or not. The first thing I saw was that Brian De Palma was going to helm the project and that it had an ""all star cast."" I put the last part in quotes because I didn't really think most of the actors could pull off the roles they had. Josh Hartnett, Scarlet J., etc. Aaron Eckhart played his role alright and I was surprised to see Hillary Swank in this type of role, but she did well pulling it off. The real surprise here was Mia Kirshner, I thought she pulled off her role the best and she had only about 1/4 the screen time than anyone else. She plays the down on her luck, struggling actress part great. She seemed the best as the young lady that was searching for fame and fortune only to have that taken away in ""the most famous unsolved murder in California history."" Nice tag line. With De Palma its either hit or miss, with his film-making style IT WAS STYLISTIC with the best of them. The production design team deserves a pat on the back, the sets and the way the production team brought back that 1940s look in California was great. Maybe the only thing great about this movie. About 30-45 minutes into the movie I was questioning if this was a dark comedy drama or not, as the audience is treated to a Hartnett and Eckhart boxing match for some reason and about HALF way through the movie I was wondering if they had forgot about the E. Short murder and had gone onto a different story all together. The ending just kind out of came out of nowhere with little build up, Hartnett character just 'poof' solves the case and after everything is over, you are left with a questionable bad taste in your mouth. It was average at best, but it could have been really a lot better, especially with the talent you have to work with.",The Black Dahlia

Had it not been for the lovely date I had, I would have been angry.The Black Dahlia is twenty-first century film noir. It is miraculous all the actors made it through the filming without lung cancer. I've never seen more people smoke in one film.Josh Hartnett is just too boyish looking to pull of the role he played. He is miscast.Aaron Eckhart is guilty of over acting and over acting, over and over.Scarlet Johanson seemed to act very little and I feel she was miscast as well.The brightest spot, in a long, tedious trudge, is Hilary Swank. She is cast to perfection and portrays the nefarious Madeleine, deliciously.Alas, the poor Mia Kirshner. Her performance of Elizabeth Short is so forgettable, it may work in her favor.According to IMDb, the budget was $50,000,000. If I had my druthers, I would have rather seen 10 $5,000,000 independent art house movies.The Black Dahlia appears to be another example of the Hollywood suits' inability to invest huge sums of money intelligently.

225,beyondtheforest,Warning: Too Smart for the Average Viewer,10,28 December 2006,"THE BLACK DAHLIA is a great film, but it is probably best left to people who can appreciate film as art and, even more importantly, an extremely complex plot. The narrative of the story can be confusing if you do not devote your complete attention to it. There are certain pieces of the puzzle you will have to put together in your mind while watching the film to understand, and I confess to using the rewind function on my DVD player to comprehend the very detailed goings-on. It's true there are numerous subplots, but if you pay close attention and follow through to the end, all will be explained.It is a film which absolutely demands multiple viewings, not only to piece the puzzles together, but also to take in the dazzling production values. Here we have a group of cinematic virtuosos collaborating to produce a significant, large-scale crime-murder-melodrama of epic proportions. From the photography, to the set designs and costumes, everything about the look and atmosphere of the film is impeccable (and superior to another noir, LA CONFIDENTIAL).The flaws of the film are confined to two areas: the intricacies of the plot and Scarlett Johannsen's performance. She struggles with the period dialogue, but she is reasonably competent. The other actors are fine, with Hillary Swank giving the best performance, and chewing enough scenery and stealing enough scenes to make Bette Davis and Joan Crawford proud.Best scenes include a lesbian nightclub in which KD Lang is dressed in drag as a pimp and croons ""Love for Sale,"" and a scene near the end of the film where a key witness confesses, goes insane, and blows her head off. This is DePalma at his best--giving us the over-the-top dramatic entertainment we all secretly love to watch! The film is just great, if you can be patient with it, and gear your mind to admire instead of criticize--for, after all, there were some film geniuses who worked on this film, and there is certainly more to admire than hold to scrutiny!",The Black Dahlia
226,grahamcarter-1,"It's DePalma, so it's still worth a view",7,12 May 2017,"'The Black Dahlia' (2006) saw the sixty-six year old director needing a total of fifteen producers to get the film made. Eleven executive producers, one being the veteran James B. Harris, who had produced nine films ranging from Stanley Kubrick's 'The Killing' (1956) to 'Cop' (1988), which was also based on a James Ellroy novel. The four producers included Art Linson, who had produced 'The Untouchables' and 'Casualties of War' for DePalma, and 'Fight Club' (1999) for David Fincher; Fincher was originally slated to direct 'Black Dahlia'.Set in L.A but filmed in Pernik Bulgaria (only a handful of exterior scenes were shot in Los Angeles), James Ellroy's novel 'The Black Dahlia' is a fictionalized take on the still-unsolved murder of aspiring starlet Elizabeth Short. This is a daylight nightmare City of Angels, and Dante Ferretti (he has worked with Pasolini, Fellini and Scorsese), built elaborate sets of L.A on Bulgarian soundstages, that knowing he's no fool, are intentionally artificial. Good Cop Dwight 'Bucky' Bleichert and the brunette Dahlia doppelgänger Madeleine Linscott stand before a portrait of 'Gwynplaine,' the deformed protagonist of Victor Hugo's novel 'The Man Who Laughs.' Bleichert says, ""I don't get modern art,"" to which Madeleine responds, ""I doubt modern art gets you either."" The concerns of Hugo's Romanticism (incorporating his critique of aristocracy), Argento's fresco troubles, German Expressionism and film noir all link when the three leads go the cinema to see 'The Man Who Laughs' (1928), based on Victor Hugo's 'L'Homme Qui Rit' (1869). It isn't explained why they are watching a film from 1928 during a film set in 1947, however the deformity in the story mirrors the wounds on the victim Elizabeth. The German expressionism takes full flight during a flamboyant lesbian bar sequences, featuring a performer in full Dietrich drag, singing 'Love For Sale' among slinky French-kissing chorines. 'Giallo' in its gender confusion (and marginally so in the revelation of the murderer), Madeleine's frequenting of lesbian bars, prior to seducing Bleichert, makes her more a 'Giallo' character than 'femme fatale.' However, her biggest problem seems to be one of genes. When Bleichert comes for a family dinner it's not too far removed from a David Lynch scene, complete with her little sister gifting him a sketch she draws of Bleichert doing Madeleine doggy style!One of 'Black Dahlia's' weaknesses is that Madeleine and Elizabeth are supposed to be Doppelganger's; certainly Madeleine is a darker character than Elizabeth, but the link is merely Madeleine stating she heard Elizabeth looked like her (she doesn't), and thought it would be interesting to have a same sex experience with a lookalike. Narcissism in extremis.'Black Dahlia' would be nothing without two classic DePalma set-pieces; the first is the shoot-out in South Central, where DePalma who loves coincidence as much as Kieslowski ('The Double Life Of Veronique,' 1991), has a wonderful overhead crane shot lifting and rising to reveal the 'Dahlia' crime scene behind. It harks back to the Louma crane shot in Argento's 'Tenbrae'. One of the least The least Argento films of of DePalma's thrillers since 'Dressed To Kill', because it's also the least DePalma of the recent DePalma thrillers. A 'Giallo' sequence is squeezed in where Lee Blanchard, all hopped up on Benzedrine is dispatched on a grand staircase at the hands of a man with a deformed face, a woman in black, a shiny switchblade, and in slow motion. 'Black Dahlia' is about the Cops and how they react to the murder rather than the murder itself, much the way David Fincher handled 'Zodiac' (2007), proving he may have been a better choice to direct. DePalma tries to put his stamp on it and in many ways he fully embraces the Dario Argento within; a contrived plot, flashy camera work, performances anywhere from sleepwalking to operatic; the operatic, or rather, histrionic performance is by Fiona Shaw. She is certifiable. She pops up about half an hour in, reappearing at the end as well, I could be talking about Argento's 'Deep Red'. Shaw's performance is in the tradition of Piper Laurie in DePalma's 'Carrie', or Piper Laurie in Argento's 'Trauma'.If DePalma didn't push the envelope of sex and violence and possess stylish camera work, he could come across as no more than a director of straight to video erotic thrillers of the eighties and nineties; the dialogue and performances don't reach much further. If he wasn't so talented he might have been asked to direct 'Night Eyes Three' (1993).",The Black Dahlia
227,jhmb2003,De Palma refuses to comply with the new rules,8,2 January 2007,"Considering all the adverse commentaries about this movie, I guess that now any director who dares to come up with some personal stuff, is punished with a rough reprimand by the public.Everything has to be a soft, straight, silly story. Any deviation from that point, any attempt to tell something with a personal language is ignored or heavily criticized by the massive audiences.As a Brian De Palma fan, I ought to say this is one of his best works in the last 20 years. Far better than the average Hollywood production because De Palma refuses to comply with the new golden rule: ""Nothing too personal, nothing so obscure. Everything must be understood by a 13 years old kid"". Other great directors, as Scorsese, lost this battle. Now, he only makes weak but overrated movies, like ""The departed"".The Black Dahlia was not made to insult the public, but push them to think on the story. Seems to be the same, now. Every scene is like a piece of a lost puzzle, deliberately hidden, and thrown away at any moment. This kind of cinema is not Peter Jackson, not a teen saga, this is adult cinema.I do not care about the real story of the girl that was murdered. James Ellroy acknowledged that point and he is cool with this adaptation. I do care about De Palma engagement with his own style, against all odds.",The Black Dahlia
228,mrnunleygo,Promise of first half betrayed by ludicrous second half,3,14 May 2017,"Brian DePalma assembled a good cast for this attempt to memorialize a famous Hollywood legend from the 1940s as a film noir. He had already proved with the magnificent ""Chinatown"" that he could realize the noir style as well as any contemporary director, so we are left to puzzle over what went wrong here. Notwithstanding an excessive amount of screen time devoted to a single boxing match, I still really liked the first half of this movie, which took its time developing the characters and story using classic noir tropes and compelling cinematography, all of which promised a splendid overall experience. Then came the second half, in which the sheer volume of subplots, plot twists, and added complications overwhelmed the actors' ability to fend off self-parody. It made me sad. It was as if DePalma had been halfway through making a good (if overlong) three-hour movie when he suddenly realized he had only a half hour of film left to finish it. (Did he ran out of money?) In the end, he tried to tie everything together with a series of brief, confusing, talky, and even ludicrous scenes that were a poor substitute for letting the audience think along with a protagonist while he pieced things together on his own.",The Black Dahlia
229,xcitenlady,Black Dahlia - A Commercial for Smokers,5,18 September 2006,"No doubt the set production was great and realistic, the movie went round and round and tried very hard to be suspenseful and interwoven but in my opinion missed the mark. After a while I lost interest in who did what....after all I wanted to concentrate on the Black Dahlia.And it was a joke to compare the looks of gender bending Hilary Swank to the actress who portrayed Dahlia....what a far far stretch. Sometimes I think Hilary has had an actually decent job of a sex change.And finally, I think they SMOKED ENOUGH CIGARETTES in this movie to give HALF OF NORTH America CANCER!! (might have been a substitute for no substance).Someone please make another Black Dahlia movie that concentrates on the real facts of the case!",The Black Dahlia
230,atliel,"Uhm, so when do we actually get to see the infamous Black Dahlia in this film?",1,8 February 2007,"First off I have seen many of Brian De Palma's films and I can tell you that he's a great director. However, give the man a crappy script and forget about it, he is incapable of making it better regardless of how great the acting, lighting and editing are; Such is the case with The Black Dahlia.On the technical side the movie shines, amazing editing, cinematography, Oscar worthy production design and costumes but the most important element to a film is missing in this one....a story. And not just a story, but the story of the infamous Black Dahlia murder, a murder that has yet to be solved, is barely touched upon in this film. The story instead revolves around the relationship between two detectives and all the stock seedy b-movie characters that Los Angeles has ready to provide. Unfortunately these characters are barely connected to the murder and when we do get to see anything remotely related to the Black Dahlia, we only get a quick glimpse and then the film jumps back to some other meaningless plot twist.It's unfortunate because the actual murder case alone does provide enough twists and turns that a film dedicated to this murder would have been great. Instead the film relies on fictional characters and ideas to surround the case in order to provide a sense of what it was like during those events and but they end up becoming filler.One may argue that this film was based off of James Ellroy's novel of the same name but I wonder how faithful to the novel it was. It seemed that Brian De Palma was more interested in making a film noir for the sake of making a film noir and less about the story. All the clichés that one can rip from the classic noirs are there, the detectives voice over, the femme fatale, the smoke filled air, the over the top dialogue riddled with slang, etc. The problem is that the old noir directors were not aware they were even making film noirs! Instead they were trying to make good films based off of dime store pulp fiction novels that reflected the post World War 2 era. As a matter of fact the term film noir was coined years later by the French after most of those films were released. That's why those films worked and that's why this one didn't.De Palma was too busy trying so much to achieve a similar look that he forgot why those old films were successful in the first place. He should have watched L.A. Confidential (another Ellroy adaptation) to see how to do it right. As a matter of fact he should have just watched his own film The Untouchables to see how he got it right back then.",The Black Dahlia
231,Mxzplk,Brian De Palma's Black Dahlia treats on the most famous crime of Lost Angeles. But it is warm and pale.,6,1 October 2006,"In The Black Dahlia (2006), there are two scenes of cinematographic bravery. In the most intricate of them, two men disastrously fall down on a staircase in slow motion, involved in a death fight. In the other, simpler and more brilliant, it is seen from afar a woman pushing a baby stand side by side to an abandoned land and, then, running away in panic because of something that saw in the woods. It is more or less there that it ends the accounting of great moments in the film. In the remaining time, the impression that gives is that the weight of age and the fatigue for swimming against the mainstream finally collapsed on the shoulders of director Brian De Palma. There is much to lament over this. Black Dahlia, the romance of James Elroy in which the movie is based on, is one of the greatest American noir-fiction titles of the second half of the twentieth century, a story of venality and epic corruption even for its scenery - the Los Angeles of the 40's. Besides that, it seemed hard to find a better film-maker to stage this plot of brutal crime, policemen manipulated by excuses forces and women of predatory sexuality then the De Palma of Dressed to Kill and Body Double. This would be, at last, a marriage planned in paradise and destined to descend to hell. Would be, but it isn't.Elroy is not an easy author to adapt. Deeply marked by the rape and murder of his mother at the age of 10, he writes as you would inspect through garbage, exhuming layer after layer of filthiness while giving voice to the anonymous characters of the police chronicles of L.A. - the cheap prostitutes, the mediocre detectives, the drunks. His text has a feverish quality that challenges reproduction, and he works with dozens of characters. But at least one director managed to distill this material into a masterwork adaptation - Curtis Hanson in L.A. Confidential. It isn't, then, an impossible task. Black Dahlia seemed propitious for this good result to repeat. In the most famous crime committed in the city, Elizabeth Stuart, age 22, aspiring actress and probable prostitute, appeared in 1947 in a abandoned land (that one from the scene described previously), cut in two halves, bloodless, with the internal organs rearranged and a face laceration from ear to ear. Until today, the ""Black Dahlia"" case, as Elizabeth was nicknamed, remains opened.The most curious thing is that Brian De Palma hesitates here to do what he does best: to loan, twisted and right, the work of other film-makers, casting them in his own cocktail of visual audacity and vulgarity. Everything is warm and pale. Even the sexual hurricane Scarlett Johansson seems here less alive then a dummy - or even then the real Elizabeth Short, that even today tortures the imagination of amateurish detectives and noir novelists.",The Black Dahlia
232,ilikepuppies,"Question marks, period.",7,14 April 2007,"As always, DePalma delivers in a number of key areas. Use of music, tone, pacing and not least his deft employment of motion. It has long been a trademark of his artistry.Others may view this as a confusing story and proclaim it unwatchable. Well, that's kind of the point. It's at heart a film mystery that ends up being just that: a mystery. The plot is fluid and indeed confusing-- about a city (Hollywood) that is equally perplexing. If we each live in our own movie, those who abide in Hollywood most likely live in a mystery movie. Everyone in show business is some form of liar....a creator of fictions, in fact in many cases a professional deceiver.So what we have here is a mysterious film about a real life mystery, the two worlds overlapping continuously. Our detectives gain clues to their puzzle from our film (which is their real lives), from OUR real lives (based on real events) and from what is the world of film, to them. Three levels of abstraction for them (and us) to draw from.How common it has become to sit in a theater and leer at another audience on the screen as they leer back at us! This overlapping of audiences (worlds) is the basis of this exploration, and also the root of confusion.Lynch engaged in this same experiment with his ""Mulholland Drive."" Same notion of Hollywood as character, same (and even more intense!) confusion, same mystery, same conflation of dimensions. What makes this better, though is DePalma's exquisite camera. Here we actually get to MOVE from one level of reality to the next.By the way, the true story this is based on remains a mystery itself, even to this day. So the ambiguity in the film is quite apt.",The Black Dahlia

That they look good is neither here nor there. Most adverts look good. You don't pay to watch them, though. Or lose two hours of your life. The film is a long, meandering mess. Those who read the book will be astounded at how bad it is, everyone else will just wonder why anyone bothered. The leads are too pretty, the dialogue wooden and explanatory, and it's 45 long minutes before Elizabeth Short turns up. The book was about obsession. I haven't a clue what the film is about.Someone should tell De Palma that to make a good film you need to do a little bit more than breathe on the lens and get female cast members to undress.Poor Elizabeth Short. She was real and she deserved better than this.",The Black Dahlia
234,PortugalOle7,Huge letdown from De Palma,5,15 September 2006,"I went into this film having seen Hollywoodland last week. Before either was released I had bigger eyes for Dahlia because of De Palma and the film just seemed a little darker. I came out of Hollywoodland very impressed. Maybe it's not totally fair to compare the two but the subject matter and time period is very similar. Being based on a James Ellroy novel, LA Confidential comes to mind, which I think is an exceptional film. So right away I was setting some high standards for Dahlia.Dahlia was just very disappointing. First and for most I had a feeling I would be let down by the acting, and it was worse than I thought. I knew Harnett was a main character and had a narration. Harnett, Eckhart, and Johansson are horrible. The only saving grace is Hillary Swank, who I'm now convinced can just about play any role in a movie and play it well.The plot and visuals make for a great film but it just never ""gets there."" I noticed that many have said its a very close adaptation to the book but I wonder if some of the back story could have been cut down a little. The introduction of Harnett and Eckhart seem very corny with the boxing match. Maybe its just their horrible acting. There seems to be so much going on. When it comes down to the main murder case, the twists and information seem rushed at times. Also whats with the ridiculous smoking in the film? It seems so phony that a character starts every scene by lighting a cigarette.Bottom line is the movie is just a plain flop. A great story by Ellroy is destroyed by horrible acting and disappointing direction from De Palma.",The Black Dahlia
235,james.p.taylor,De Palma shows style over substance.,6,18 September 2006,"In the late 1940's two LA cops are teamed up to bust criminals with outstanding warrants. When Bucky Bleichert (a miscast Josh Hartnett) and Lee Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) go on a seemingly normal bust they don't realise that only a few hundred feet away a crime scene has been discovered that will live in popular memory almost sixty years later.The horribly mutilated body that's just been discovered is that of Elizabeth Short (Mia Kirshner), a wannabe actress from Massachusetts. Within an hour the whole LA police department, especially Bucky and Lee, are trying to figure out who the girl was and how this awful thing had happened to her.The females scattered throughout the film include Lee's girlfriend Kay Lake (an awful Scarlett Johansson) and a mysterious woman that Bucky comes across in his investigations (Madeleine Linscott played by Hilary Swank). As the investigation begins to get more intense Lee begins to lose his mind. It's at these points the really good actors show their colours.De Palma is a brilliant technical director, of that there's no doubt. What he can't do is develop character. The film falls in to roughly three parts. The first is a good, gripping, gritty look at LA just after the war. Then it gets to the second third and it starts to feel like you've been sitting watching the film for hours. The actors all seem to be starring in different films and the director hasn't noticed. The final third takes the film into Twin Peaks territory. There are huge twists as the writers tie up loose ends and begin to decide who the killer of Short was. Throw in corruption, slum housing, paintings and some sex.This isn't dreadful by any stretch of the imagination but it isn't worth forking out the money to see in the cinema either. Johansson stars in yet another late summer stinker though. this should have been a strong role for her, but she seems to be trying so hard that everything is forced. The real weak link is Hartnett. He walks around with a dumbfounded look on his face the whole time and although sweet for five minutes is painful and annoying in a two hour film. Swank should have turned her role down as well. Although a beautiful woman she isn't exactly a femme fatale, what her role needs.So, good camera work but let down hugely by an awful cast and that's what will always sink a film. It's also too short. Given an extra half an hour De Palma could have probably made a the ending if not better then at least satisfying.",The Black Dahlia

And even sadder is, THE REAL STORY IS TEN TIMES MORE INTERESTING THAN THIS HORRIBLE BLUNDER. Sad, sad, sad. The only thing I can tell for sure, from this movie, is that Brian De Palma thinks ripping women's clothes off and shoving them down on something: a table, a bed, another table, is apparently, ""steamy"".

The story moved at a snails pace which is a huge problem for me. Elroy's LA Confidential, another 'great period piece' for post war LA was far more entertaining. This could have been also but I fear DePalma's direction was the problem as the storyline just floated along. Here is one thing that really bugged me too: Hartnett's haircut..why didn't he cut his hair according to the style of the times..it looked completely out of place. I did like the cinematography, the sound effects gave it a certain edginess too that gave it some charm. But for some reason, I missed the point where Hartnett's sidekick became obsessed with the Black Dahlia. Probably, because I couldn't sit in my seat any longer and had to go to the lavatory.

No thrills, no tension, no emotion, draped in a cloying horn-heavy pseudo-noir Isham score. The co-villain looks like a refugee from Who Killed Roger Rabbit? Someone should tell actresses who want to play forties glamour gals to GAIN 15 POUNDS. Not even Lauren Bacall had the scrawny shoulders and bony breastplates of Johansson and Swank. Swank fills out her lace gowns like a barber pole, and Johansson is a study in cosmetics and couture, nothing more. Her lips look like advertisements for collagen injections, distracting giblets that distort her facial proportions.A chubby, smirking k.d. lang as a tuxedoed crooner in an unlikely lesbian bar evokes not Marlene Dietrich, but Spanky MacFarland.

There is so much boring, silly back-story about the two cops who investigate the murder of the famous flower that it takes what seems about 90 minutes for the body to be discovered. After that, things slow down even further, though it didn't seem possible. Hillary Swank is the one bright spot in this gory mess. She gives good value, but considering what she is asked to do, it doesn't help that much in the end. I know actors need work, but it is hard to forgive the other perpetrators here.",The Black Dahlia
243,cinemaofdreams,Unintentional Film Noir Parody,7,9 February 2010,"I must say I have never been a fan of Brian De Palma. As far as I'm concerned the closest he has ever come to a masterpiece was Dressed to Kill, and as with all his films, it eventually drowns in its style.I picked The Black Dahlia up as a five dollar DVD thinking it might be of interest. I was unaware De Palma had been at the helm but what a hoot. I rate this film higher than it deserves for its pure comic value. This is a film that is so off that it's good. More opera than noir this would make a great stage musical. The characters are so over the top. Brian De Palma should not have translated the book into a noir film if he meant this to be taken seriously. But this was the time of noir revivals and I guess he felt obliged.If one considers L.A. Confidential to be a masterpiece and a great interpretation of its source material as well as liking their film noir to be serious and dark; don't bother with this movie. Curtis Hanson did create a great film with L.A. Confidential, though the one thing I object to with many of the critiques I have read of De Palma's film is its confusing plot. L.A. Confidential has to be the most convoluted, confusing film I have ever seen. Any confusion in Dahlia's plot pales in comparison.On the other hand, with a little imagination a viewer can transcend the film's intentions and amuse themselves with the comic-book grandeur of this piece. All that is missing is Batman and a few musical numbers. 3 1/2 out of 5.",The Black Dahlia
244,XFLRWF,Avoid at all costs! Stick with LA Confidential,1,21 September 2006,"Richly confusing and far too drawn aptly describes Brian De Palma's latest film, ""The Black Dahlia."" Based upon James Ellroy's novel, the film runs all over the place as it attempts to tackle too many plot twists and characters. This convoluted situation only adds confusion to the audience and leaves them feeling only indifferent when the finale is revealed. Even with the acting talents of Josh Hartnett, Hilary Swank, and Aaron Eckhart, the film is hardly worth watching. The cast does admirable jobs with their roles in capturing the feel and attitude of the 1940's era. However, even they cannot fix this mixed-up mess of movie.On January 15, 1947 in Los Angeles a young woman named Elizabeth Short (Mia Kirshner) is found murdered in field. Her face had been sliced and her body cut in half. Among the policemen to arrive at the scene are hero cops Dwight ""Bucky"" Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) and Lee Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart). Together, the partners attempt to unravel the mystery behind the gruesome crime and untangle the web of deceit that is covering up the murderer.Brian De Palma's stylistic direction fits very well with this noir genre. With an often glossy look and character close-ups, he presents the feel of an old-time detective film. De Palma's pacing of the film, however, is incredibly slow. There are just too many characters, flashbacks, and turnarounds to have the film make sense. The film jumps around so much that it is easy to get lost in the story. There are far too many false endings that by the time the climax is reached, there is little reason to care about the murder or the conclusion at all. Had De Palma sped up the character developments, the pacing of the film could have been sped up and easier to enjoy.Josh Friedman's adaptation of James Ellroy's novel focuses more on the characteristics and internal trials of Bleichert and Blanchard than it does on the Dahlia herself. This is was good strategy that went too far. Friedman is writer who loves to build up his characters but doesn't know exactly when to stop and begin the implementation of the story. More time is established learning about the people involved than is focused on the case. When the action or breaks in the case come about, it comes and goes with a lull feeling. As with De Palma's direction, there is simply apathy when the conclusion comes to pass.Despite the technical shortcomings of ""Dahlia"", Josh Hartnett does a great job of carrying this film. Hartnett plays the role with fierce heroism but also gifted at capturing Bleichert's internal struggles of guilt. While he is a good cop who is extremely dedicated to his work, he also struggles with the decision to sleep with his partner's girlfriend. One of Hartnett's best traits is being able to read his facial features. Through Hartnett's expressions, one can almost read his mind to foreshadow events before he does. In contrast to Bleichert, Lee Blanchard is a more troubled soul whom Eckhart plays to a T. Eckahart shows Blanchard's equal dedication but has darker skeletons in his closet. This contrast is best shown during the Dahlia case as Eckhart exemplifies frantic behavior and short temperament as he obsesses over its resolution. Mia Kirshner's role of Elizabeth Short is limited to a series of screen tests viewed by the investigating police. While her performance does little to shed light on the real life Short, Kirshner does portray her as a sad and tragic figure. She had the dream to make it big in Hollywood but could never quite reach it. With limited knowledge of her character, Kirshner does bring out the sympathetic qualities of the girl and showed that she did whatever she could to make it big. It was a tragic death for her tragic life. Of all the characters, Scarlett Johannson's role as Blanchard's girlfriend, Kay Lake, is the least developed as the typical cop's girlfriend role. But Johannson does well enough with what she is given. She shows love and concern for her man and yet also fights her feelings for his partner. Johansson carries her part out on the emotional level but there is little for her to go on her performance. Hilary Swank's performance as socialite Madeline Linscott is chillingly beautiful. Swank plays the enigmatic temptress with a charm that could drain a cobra of its venom. Her ambiguity about which side she is on is the most enjoyable quality of the film. On the one hand, you want to sympathize with her troubles and then flip the coin and you would be left guessing again. Swank's performance breathes the last breath into an otherwise dying film. With advertisements playing this film up to be the next ""L.A. Confidential"", it falls short tremendously. The film would have been just as big a disappointment had it not been built to follow its predecessor's footsteps. De Palma seems to want too much to happen in such a short span of time that he simply threw in everything to see what would stick. But it is just a big mess where nothing makes enough sense to make the audience care. The acting talents of the cast are unfortunately cannot save this debacle. For a better detective story, stick with ""L.A. Confidential."" Grade: D+",The Black Dahlia
245,Lori_ruelo,"The murder case of the black dahlia, in a style of film noir!",5,19 December 2018,"Director Brian De Palma takes us with us, in 1947, the City of Angels. Two half-off boxers and best friends of the Police Department, hunt down mafia bosses, petty criminals and corrupt police officers. As they stumbling into the fall of the black dahlia, the two friends go to their limits. Actually, the thriller is coherent if De Palma, the story, had told something more profoundly. The story does not progress and the characters remain weak and boring. The character of hero Bucky Bleichert is portrayed by Josh Hartnett. One finds, however, that Hartnett is somewhat overpowered with his role. Hartnett plays his part but seems tense. Even the self-assured Scarlett Johansson seems rather pale and helpful here, in her role.
The top two roles have Aaron Eckhart, who happily plays his role as Lee Blanchard to the limit, and Hilary Swank, who personifies a mysterious femme fatale. The camera is also well positioned and goes along with the action. No wonder cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond was nominated for an Oscar here. For the point of view here is not only directed to the general, but also focuses the faces of the individual persons, of whom one does not know which side of the law they are on. The screenplay was written here by James Ellroy. He actually mixed the real case of the black dahlia with some fiction of the film industry. In the film, the killer was also posed. In truth, though, the Black Dahlia case has never been solved. Even though it's that the story has been cleared up, the whole thing is largely left behind and the film's course, runs with the handbrake put on. Verdict: You're better used to De Palma. A good thriller just unfortunately not quite exciting implemented!",The Black Dahlia

You would figure the movie has everything, a great director (DePalma) some nice stars and an excellent story plot. HOW CAN YOU GO WRONG?! Well somewhere along the lines these knuckleheads managed to screw up the perfect movie. After an actress in California is murdered by a demented killer the cops go nuts and try and track the killer before he can strike again. I loved ""L.A Confidential"" it is one of my favorite movies but the writer here just can't seem to pull the gritty intrigue in. The audience began to grow weary of this two hour plus movie.

Brian DePalma's Black Dahlia is a movie based upon an Ellroy novel, for the first time. Do not say it is not true to the Black Dahlia case, because it was not based upon it, rather the question is- is it true to the Black Dahlia novel? I think so. It probably confuses those who have never read God's great novel, and annoys those who think He is a perverted little Son of a Bitch, but it was Ellroy, in spades. Now, Mr DePalma, let us have Ellroy's masterwork. Only you can do American Tabloid. Get Crowe & Pearce, lose the glasses, and ace 'em. Ellroy's 'fiction' would make Oliver Stone's 'faction' look very bloody limp. In fact mate, get Hanson to co-direct it, and really chew the carpet. Crowe would make a great Bondurant provided you stuck him on Alan Ladd stilts.",The Black Dahlia
248,JoeJames76,More like a Black Hole,1,24 January 2007,"Brian De Palma has an uncanny ability to keep you in suspense. In some instances, like Mission: Impossible or Carlito's Way ,the suspense is so intense that you can hear a pin drop in the theatre. On the other hand, De Palma's suspense can be of the variety that keeps the viewer guessing, ""When will this movie ever end? Or, more importantly, will it ever actually begin?"" It is within this category that The Black Dahlia falls, alongside De Palma's other notable attempts, Mission to Mars and Femme Fatale.Now it's easy to hate on De Palma, just as easy as it is to trumpet him for notable works like Scarface and The Untouchables (and my personal fave, Wise Guys). This is because when he fails on a film, he fails miserably. 100%, absolutely, ""so bad it's good"", win another Razzie it's that awful, miserable. In attempting to revitalize the noir genre for the umpteenth time, De Palma gives us a clouded, convoluted and at times contrived film that does make us yearn for the noir of yesteryear, only to forget this one that really missed its mark.This film sucks all the life out of the excellent cast, or should i say, Josh Hartnett sucks the life out of his co-stars, while he's sucking so bad on screen. A quick glance at the worst films of the past decade will show Hartnett's ability to accurately choose the worst projects in Hollywood (Sin City aside). This is unfortunate, because on paper, The Black Dahlia looks intriguing. A script based on a James Ellroy novel and an unsolved real life murder in 1940s Hollywood. Sounds like L.A. Confidential all over again.Sadly, it tries stylistically too hard to be reminiscent of the noir films De Palma is so fond of and neglects to update its genre for today's audience. So it feels like an old film transported ahead in time where today's audience is more sophisticated and savvy, leaving little to the imagination and drawing out plot points much longer than needed. The acting borders on melodrama, while the dialogue sounds classically inspired, but delivered like a grade 9 student reading Shakespeare for the first time, hitting all the wrong notes.It is a movie searching for an identity, telling its tale using mixed up genre codes, but not in an attempt to create something new (which would have been nice) but in a way to disrupt the viewer's connection to the film and degrade decades of film history in the process. It jumps around like a poorly conceived student film yet manages to prod along at a pace so tedious that you'd wish it were a student short film.Still, some actors manage to emerge unscathed (see Eckhart and Johansson in other films), while Hilary Swank reminds us just how miraculous it is that her name will forever be preceded by ""two time academy award winner"". Now there's a mystery that will forever go unsolved.Grade: D",The Black Dahlia
249,Bigprisc,Pretentious pseudo Noir,6,25 September 2006,"I have always been fascinated by the story of Elizabeth Short ever since I accidentally read her story on the net. And when I heard of ""The Black Dahlia"", I am so excited and had been following it's progress from the beginning. What gets me most excited is the fact that the director is Brian De Palma, and great casts galore, like Mia Kirshner, Hilary Swank, Fiona Shaw, and eye candy like Scarlett Johansson and Josh Hartnett.So can you imagine my disappointment with the movie when I actually saw it? I don't know, I think it might be because I expected too much from the movie. It's a major letdown.Firstly, commendable effort to make the film stylistic and true to the noir era of films. But, somehow, it comes off too fake, to purposeful.Then the acting, especially of the lead characters like Bucky and Lee, Kay and Madeleine. It felt like they took a crash course on ""Acting like Humphrey Bogart and Eva Garbo."" While the great Humphrey Bogart believed in his roles as the brooding lead man, Josh Hartnett didn't believe in his role, he believed in his ability to pretend to be a Humphrey Bogart. It comes across so forced. And god, how many times has he got to cry, he is a sensitive guy, we get it, lets move on.Scarlett Johansson did a mighty find job, but so useless in this confusing plot line. Hilary Swank, well, convincing enough as the femme fatale, but not intriguing enough for me to actually believe Bucky's obsession.In fact, the whole movie is a mystery to me, why did Bucky do what he did, there wasn't any emotions on his face to suggest anyway. To me, he just looks good in suspenders.Special mention to Mia Kirshner as Elizabeth Short. Her short segments in black and white is the only thing that is convincing, her enigma shines true and you believed why Lee and Bucky could be so obsessed with her. I really don't see how they could compare Mia Kirshner to Hilary Swank. Seriously, are we suppose to believe that they look alike just because the characters in the story repeated drummed that information in our head?So many things are so pretentious and so many irrelevance.

Like mentioned before, I was disappointed. It had a lot of pointless sex in it and a random lesbian plot hole in it.

The Black Dahilia is a good book  not his best, but a good book. L.A. Confidential was a book that 'couldn't be made into a movie' but was  against all odds, made into a great movie.The Black Dahlia is just a mess. A mess made by talented people is a mess, nevertheless. This is the noir Showgirls. You may find some campy amusement in some of the roles. You may wonder aloud if the director was on the set, or even in the casting sessions. You may wonder if the producers know anyone who could have been able to come to a screening and say: ""this makes no sense, it has bad acting, it has bad casting and it needs massive editing and maybe some additional scenes."" I frankly don't even have hope for a 'director's cut' because I don't think this film can be saved. Shame on Brian DePalma for wasting an opportunity to make a great film out of a great book.Was everything about it bad? No. Uncharacteristically of recent Hollywood work, there is a good sense of time and place, uninterrupted by jarring anachronisms. The color palette is muted and really extraordinarily beautiful. Scarlett Johanson's lips and bust are as captivating and ever-present as we wish her acting chops were. Eckhart is badly used. Hartnett is one-note and doesn't elicit empathy. Swank is great to look at, Mesmerizing, really, but unconvincing. There are good performances in minor roles. The cars are nice. Lots of Lipstick Lezbos.

252,saturnalia33,Excruciatingly slow with a messy plot and redundant storyline,3,11 December 2006,"The Black Dahlia is a mystery thriller set in the 1940's and directed by Brian De Palma. He has spent a long time in the industry and is responsible for three arguable classics: The Untouchables, Scarface and Carrie. You'd therefore be right in thinking he's an esteemed director although if look closely, his last great film was Carlito's Way back in 1993 and he's directed some very mediocre movies in between then and now, most notably Mission Impossible and Snake Eyes.The movie is based on the novel by James Ellroy and follows two detectives, played by Josh Harnett and Aaron Eckhart, as they investigate a murder. As Eckharts character Blanchard becomes obsessed about the case, Harnetts character Bleichert becomes involved with his partners lover, Kay, played by Scarlett Johansson.As Blanchard estranges himself from the close relationship that the three have enjoyed and Bleichert and Kay grow closer, Bleichert himself delves deeper into the murder mystery to solve the case and resolve the tensions that have boiled over into their personal relationships.The Black Dahlia is expertly shot with great sets of 1940's decoration displaying the inherent seediness that the film revolves around; the world of femme fatales, corrupt policemen, and the criminal underworld.However, the plot development is excruciatingly slow and when it does take off it becomes messy and I had all but lost the plot and will to live around three-quarters of the way in until it started to piece together at the end but twist after twist made the storyline redundant and pointless and I couldn't wait until the credits rolled. With De Palma returning in 2008 with an Untouchables prequel, is he grasping at straws to redeem his career?",The Black Dahlia
253,hollywoodgirl-1,"Good, Though Definitely Misleading",5,24 September 2006,"I wish I had known going into this movie that it wasn't what the trailer makes it out to be. This is definitely one of the cases where the trailer is shaped to draw in the audience by strategically placing scenes together to make the movie something it is not. I was under the impression that this movie would be all about the murder of Elizabeth Short and the events leading up to it. Elizabeth Short and her murder actually play almost minor roles. In fact, it's a good twenty minutes before they even find her body (one of the best scenes in the movie, in my opinion, but more on that later), and you hear nothing of her until that point onwards. The movie is less about the Dahlia than it is about Josh Harntett's character, Dwight ""Bucky"" Bleichart. There is much backstory in the beginning showing the development of the relationship between Bucky and his soon-to-be partner, Lee Blanchard, played by Aaron Eckhart. Lee is given story and some good scenes, but in the end I felt that I barely got to know his character at all. The same goes for Scarlett Johanssen's Kay Lake. She doesn't receive much development either. I think the main problem is that the film tries to juggle too many characters, plots, and genres for it to work. Granted, everything is all interconnected, but almost to the point of being unbelievable. There are major characters who get minor-character screen time. One of the movie's biggest mistakes is that there are too many times when Bucky makes an immense leap of logic between two or three seemingly isolated events that is explained sometimes right after he comes to a realization and sometimes not until much later and usually in flashback, which only serves to confuse even more. The movie is a drama, thriller, romance, noir-imitation, comedy, and crime story all at once, and in this case those genres don't mix well together. Bucky's incessant voice-over and 40s dialogue give the film a noir-esquire feel, but the scenes it's played over make it hard to take seriously. There was one thing (and not just one, but this one stands out) that I liked a lot. I was very impressed with the discovery of Elizabeth Short's body. The scene is masterful, suspenseful, and interposed with another suspenseful scene so that the actual examination of her body by the police is prolonged enough to mount sufficient tension. Blanchard and Bleichart are doing a stakeout. The camera pans high above the street and buildings from their car to a field one street over from them. A woman is walking with a stroller when she stops and notices something in the grass. The camera is just far enough away and just out of focus enough that you can sort of tell what she's looking at, but can't see it well enough. The camera then pans back over to Bucky and Lee. I was sitting on the edge of my seat, feeling unbelievable frustration that the two LAPD detectives were so close and yet we were going to have to wait a few more minutes to see the body. It was one of the best scenes in any recent movie I've seen. All in all, the movie was good, though not without its flaws. I wouldn't mind seeing it again.",The Black Dahlia

Confusing plot deviations, a clumsy finale, and a misleading trailer all add to Brian DePalma's deviousness in film-making. I thought he might have finally arrived as a first class Director, after all the B movies of the 80's with his paramour Nancy Allen, who couldn't act her way out of a community theater play. As most of the scenes were shot in the daytime, didn't anyone remind Mr. DePalma that this genre mainly took place at night, with bold use of shadows creating tension and mystery? Scarlett Johanson, also miscast, lacked the allure and sexiness of a 40's movie diva. Maybe she should have watched some of Veronica Lake's or Lauren Bacall's early movies.

It's never boring and, I would argue, willfully infuriating. While it's by no means an ""objectively"" good film (whatever that means), it drowns the viewer in its crazy, almost parodic, overwhelming style. De Palma goes gleefully over the edge here; it's hard to think of another film that looks this good, has moments of brilliance, and simultaneously lacks all pretensions to making sense in terms of plot and narrative cohesion. It's (sometimes) awfulness is part of its charm, I think. It's not neat in the way ""L.A. Confidential"" is, but you'd be hard pressed to find another film that relishes style for its own sake (especially in an age of bland, unimaginative, style-less, ""functional"" cinema and television fodder).It falls apart at various points, but who cares, really? De Palma-as-auteur certainly doesn't. All his notable films (and even the truly horrendous ones) are a pastiche of scenes from better films, ratcheted up ten notches and with almost no care about such ""secondary elements"" as plot consistency. It's what he's known for. This one is pure chaos - mainly because there's so much plot mayhem whereas most De Palma films are terminally short on plot - but I enjoyed it immensely, warts 'n all.If you're an Ellroy fan, steer clear. If you loved ""L.A. Confidential"" for it's narrative consistency and fluency, steer clear. If you like ""well made films"" in the traditional sense, steer clear. It's, as I've suggested, a film that, in a sense, sarcastically lampoons ""well-made films"" - it has all the trappings of a ""well-made film"" but adds an infuriating, to some, dose of pure narrative chaos and stylistic frenzy. The topsy-turvy, plot-heavy, but senseless script is itself a parody of a good script. Even the use of Vilmos Zsigmond, who shot some beautiful-looking films from Hollywood's second golden age, seems a wry nod at those classics. In that regard, the overkill sepia effect  signifying ""classic noir"" - seems to underscore my point.""The Black Dahlia"" elicits either a wildly positive or utterly negative response from most viewers, the latter, admittedly, being the majority.

It seemed like a gripping ride, starting with an intriguing unsolved Hollywood mystery, and using an all star cast, Josh Hartnett still hot from a twisting ""Lucky Number Slevin"", Aaron Eckhart walking tall after ""Thank You for Smoking"", and Scarlett Johansson after every movie she touches, not too mention the appearance of much Academy-loved Hilary Swank. Sounds great doesn't it? Yeah...the cast list is probably the best part.I don't know if I can completely fault the cast for this one, although their agents deserve a bit of a beating. The acting was decent, Eckhart became over the top as the movie continued, while Johansson and Swank seemed under utilized. The movie fell on the shoulders of Hartnett who couldn't manage to drag the lifeless movie for the entire 2 hours. After suffering through the two hours I quickly checked to see who did this screenplay, since I found it to be the true fault of the film. It took me no less than 2 minutes to realize the error of my ways. We had none other than Josh Friedman to thank for this clunker. If you weren't sure who that was, he's the same writer that gave us the glorified crap that is ""War of the Worlds"". If Friedman's goal is to work with great directors like Spielberg and De Palma, only to tarnish their reputations then he is achieving that goal. Why these directors choose to work with him, baffles me, he must have friends in high places. Despite being a very visually pleasing movie, a beautifully illustrated film noir, at times I felt that De Palma's directing faltered. Most notably a portion of the film shot in the first person, that reminded me of the Christopher Walken SNL sketch ""The Continental"", and actually, I would have rather watched that, since that would have at least been funny. In all, don't waste your time. If you like other De Palma films, such as ""Scarface"" or ""The Untouchables"", go and revisit those films.

258,julioecolon,Slack Dullia,2,26 December 2006,"Ellroy's novel (although not a great one) is much better than this adaptation, which misses much of the author's quirky obsessions with the homo-erotic world of uniformed bruisers and the fetid landscape they both inhabit and resist. In Ellroy, we have an unmitigated tension between the bravura of condensed, tight, idiosyncratic language and its uncannily photographic, incisively precise ability to capture the world of violent men on the edge of an unsettling California nightmare: the tense jaw, the flexed muscle, the bulged crotch, the billy club swinging in a sledge-hammer arch, all of this set against the seamy Hollywood landscape of easy women in cheap motel rooms, free-flowing booze, hijacked rolls of C-notes and amphetamine pills, pools of broken bones and blood, and causes-célèbres crimes committed on both sides of the law. Brian De Palma's film falls far short of the mark, however. Of course, one can't help thinking of L.A. Confidential, and with good reason, since L.A. Confidential, in a seemingly effortless way, pays homage to Ellroy's dark obsessions, and it accomplishes this feat quite successfully by casting actors with the skill to move between the dark and the light. Whoever made the final casting decisions for Black Dahlia needed to think more about the darker inner-core of human nature, however. Josh Hartnett, for example, does not work as Bucky Bleichert. His face is far too contemporary and he's just too pretty (and thus boring) for the role. Scarlet Johnansson doesn't have the acting skill needed to bring Kay Lake off well, and she's far too dolled-up throughout to make her more than a cream puff. Aaron Eckhart comes closest to embodying a palpable version of a character in Lee Blanchard, but we miss the rapport he is supposed to have with Bucky. In fact, none of the actors seem to be in synch with each other and this is most painfully obvious in the chemistry that fails to develop between Bucky Bleichert and Madeleine Sprague (Linscott in the film), the Elizabeth Short look-a-like played by Hillary Swank, who looks nothing at all like the Elizabeth Short in the black and white screen tests that Bucky pours over. Josh Friedman did a hack job on the script, which I found to be especially incoherent and difficult to follow (even though I have just read the novel.)

260,travisyoung,Sucks like an airline toilet,1,6 June 2008,"Alright, so do you want the good news or the bad news? Wait, just nevermind, it's all bad: THIS MOVIE SUCKS! Wanna hear more? Okay, you're the boss...When I first popped in the DVD, I was genuinely excited about this movie. I was thinking about its sporadically successful but admirably gifted director Brian De Palma; I thought about the cast, most of whom I normally consider to be competent actors; and I thought about how James Ellroy's original novel by the same name is undeniably good, even if it's not great. I thought I had enough to hope for an entertaining two hours...boy was I wrong! Still, I can honestly say that as I watched The Black Dahlia I experienced a surprisingly wide range of emotions: First, extreme boredom...in fact, I found it difficult to not pass out. But then I slowly realized I was actually becoming physically exhausted fighting the natural but overwhelming urge to rip the DVD out of the player and send it flying across the room like a frisbee to crash and shatter into hundreds of broken pieces (even just imagining the movie as splintery shards of disc dancing on the floor brought on a rapturous glee equivalent to Pooh Bear slurping up a pawful of huney). But about halfway in, my agony melted into volcanic rage and no power on earth was able to keep me from shouting at the screen with all the scruples of a spastic Tourette.The Black Dahlia is aggressively bad, as if everyone involved in making it wanted the audience to suffer unfathomable punishment for watching...there are UN treaties that ban lesser tortures than watching this movie. Idiot purists would complain that the movie isn't faithful to the book, but that simply isn't true. As far as the basic story, the same things happen more or less as in the novel, only the novel didn't suck. What else can I say? Bad acting all around (except for Mia Kirshner, who did a surprisingly fine job at playing a slutty bad actress), bad music, bad editing, bad direction, bad writing, poor use of cameras, film, sets, script, actors, and studio vehicles. It lacked fundamental cinematic devices, like plot and performances.Please, pretty please, avoid this movie at all costs. There are many things in life much more enjoyable than sitting through this film, like having a root canal, talking to your mother-in-law about all your inadequacies, or having your eyes plucked out with a rusty grapefruit spoon. The one lingering question in my mind is whether it is more masochistic to make this bad a movie, or to watch it.",The Black Dahlia
261,arvy,Fans of Ellroy will be disappointed - (a period drama with no drama),5,8 May 2007,"A good looking film, beautifully set and not much more.The Black Dahlia is a story about the murder of an unknown actress and throughout the film an honest cop tries his best to find out what happened to her, as well as those whom she came in touch with.The cast is fairly strong, but very soon in, you are convinced that everyone was mis-cast. The ""Dahlia"" herself doesn't appear until about a third of the way into the film and much of the first half of the the film relates to the lead cop and his relationship with his colleague and friend.Throughout the acting is incredibly wooden and the dialogue does make you cringe. The last few scenes tie up things reasonably well, however by this point you have really lost interest.The settings were good, but there was no tension or engagement. The filmmakers got the ""period"" bit of ""period drama"" right. It is a shame they didn't get the rest",The Black Dahlia
262,mse1576,You really have to be an Ellroy fan....,7,22 September 2006,"In order to appreciate this movie, it would be helpful for people to have read some of James Ellroy's novels. They spend many pages laying a foundation for the rest of the story, something that can be done more easily in a book than in a movie.That said, the lack of any real foundation is what keeps this movie from becoming great. We simply don't feel that close to the characters, something that the book does a better of doing. Other reviewers have compared this movie to the great LA Confidential. Having just finished that book, I found the movie cut out a lot of material contained in the novel, thus making it more palatable to the general public.What the movie does do quite well is capture the spirit of the Black Dahlia novel. This only really impresses those who are big fans of James Ellroy. Further, much of the dialog comes from the book; it is classic film noir stuff. The dialog is fast and tough. Scarlett Johansen and Hilary Swank play the love interests. They nail their parts, particularly Johansen.You should see this movie for one main reason, it is a fine example of a lost American art form, film noir. In that mode, the film succeeds triumphantly.",The Black Dahlia
263,monk_e_fish,Great performances and looks but ultimately a failure,6,7 November 2006,"The Black Dahlia will inevitably suffer from comparisons with Curtis Hanson's adaptation of Ellroy's LA Confidential and it undoubtedly does not match up in terms of developed and interesting characters or a plot that holds your interest to the end. Frankly, the final third is a little baffling and the denouement just a bit silly. However, that is not to say that the Black Dahlia doesn't have much to recommend it on its own terms. The characters may be noir caricatures but the cast, with the exception of the horribly OTT Fiona Shaw, is strong. Hartnett is a moderately convincing lead but really the film lights up when he is paired with either the unpredictable and bitter Eckhart, Swank's predatory rich bitch Dahlia doppelganger or Scarlett Johansson who simply oozes old Hollywood sex appeal as the woman between the two detectives in what his her finest performance since her breakout role in Lost in Translation. While adapting a sprawling narrative like Ellroy's into a feature film proves beyond the screenwriters in places, De Palma's visuals are never less than stunning. The crane shot around the neighbourhood of the murder and the detective's gunfight recalls the opening of Touch of Evil in the way the camera follows various people in the neighbourhood, making the murder in the background seem incidental to the town around it. Throughout the film, De Palma brings both the glamour and the seedy underbelly of Hollywood in its Golden Age right up on screen and creates just the right murky atmosphere for this sepia toned neo-noir. The real revelation here, though, is De Palma's decision to show Hartnett's Bleichert watching Betty Short's screentests and letting these little black and white vignettes serve as a kind of flashback to a struggling actress whose mask of cheery optimism begins to fall away to reveal many layers of pain and tragedy. Mia Kirshner as Short in this footage is superb, making you really feel how her life has slipped away from her even before her tragic death. Even in her few brief scenes, Short becomes the one character who the audience can empathise with and pity. Unfortunately, the Black Dahlia isn't quite the sum of its parts, stunning visuals and quality performances don't come together to form a decent narrative and it won't be knocking LA Confidential from its spot as the definitive modern noir. It is, however, a picture that is well worth seeing and Da Palma's best since The Untouchables. ***",The Black Dahlia

265,MorganMan1,It was worse than I expected,2,16 September 2006,"The Black Dahlia is based on a true story and you would think it would be straightforward, that it would stick to a plot. The movie is a long-lasting crime thriller that seems to have three or four different plots going all the time. Most of the sub plots are far-fetched and hard to buy into or to even keep up with. The film is about a crime scene that puzzled the country on 1947 in Los Angeles by means of a frightening and bizarre death that could not even be shown to the public. The felony is based on a true story and is with reference to the death of a rising star named Betty Ann Short. It gets so complex that in the end I lost track of the main plot and started taking mind trips.Even though this movie must have cost a bundle to make, this film is second-rate and reminded me of a costume drama ""B"" movie. The film has innumerable celebrities to choose from which all do a poor job of acting and seem to be pretending to be some famous star from the Golden Age. Some of the acting was so bad I laughed out loud and embarrassed myself. There was one exception to this laughable acting, Scarlett Johansson. She did a passable job.I advise The Black Dahlia to moviegoers that like $10 popcorn and are willing to watch any thing just to get away to the movies. That's why I went to see it and it was worse than I expected. Hopefully in the future some production companies will learn from their mistakes and produce some better mystery films that are based on true stories. I'm not looking for affirmation or agreement, just calling them like I see them and I give this one two thumbs down.",The Black Dahlia
266,barbara-czarniawska,This truly is an entertainment!,8,28 December 2006,"After the complete trivialization of James Ellroy's novel in L.A. Confidential, it is a sheer joy to see clever and beautiful rendering of The Black Dahlia by Brian Palma. And no, it is not necessary to have read the book to understand the plot, although it is necessary to watch the movie with attention. Many movie goers seem nowadays used to be told the plot, rather than being shown it  witness the incomprehension of many viewers as to the resolution of Caché. A message to the female viewers: if, last Christmas, you gave your heart to George Cloney only to see how he gave it away to Nespresso, this year you can give it to somebody special: Josh Hartnett. He can melt the hardest of hearts, and not only by his endearingly good looks  he can act, too. Even Scarlett Johansson in this film does more than pouting and/or showing her earring.

267,cinematicheroes,The Old Bait and Switch ...,2,16 September 2006,"Remember the old 'Bait and Switch' routine. They get you into the store looking to buy one thing, and then they sell you another? Well, that's exactly what will happen if you go to see THE BLACK DAHLIA expecting some semblance of truth, reality or even a movie about the murder of Elizabeth Short.In reality, this film is more of an L.A. Confidential copycat impostor than it is a retelling of the grisliest murder in Los Angeles history. The mood of the film does not in any way convey just how horrified the city of Los Angeles was by this grisly and unthinkable crime. In fact, the murder and Short's story is little more than an afterthought, a sort of back story, side-plot to the real nonsense that takes place for more than two hours on the screen.As someone who has some knowledge of these murders, from books, web-sites, documentaries and yes, even an E-True Hollywood Story; this film adds nothing new, and actually blatantly makes things up.As I said the murder is nothing more than a backdrop for several fictional characters. The film even goes so far as to 'invent' a killer, and the ending should be the poster ending for anti-climactic endings.And, when the body is discovered and the Police Chief played by Mike Starr is talking about keeping the pertinent facts out of the paper, he neglects to mention that the body of the victim is severed in two pieces. You'd think it would be the first thing he would say.But, then again, you'd think this movie would be about L.A.'s most terrible unsolved crime, the gruesome murder of Elizabeth Short. In reality, it has very little to do with that. It's more of an attempt at very bad film noir.Elizabeth Short deserved better than to have the old 'Bait and Switch' routine pulled on her story.

268,federicaboldrini1984,An insult to Film Noir,4,4 October 2006,"Oh dear, this film is SO bad. It looks like director Brian De Palma thinks that ""Film Noir"" means ""plotless gorefest"". Humphrey Bogart and the other good ol' stars of film noir should be spinning in their graves. This film has only one good feature: Dante Ferretti's gorgeous sets. Most of the rest is rubbish. The performances of the lead cast are not really bad, but have their problems. Josh Hartnett, that pretty boy, kind of lacks in charisma, and personally I found Aaron Eckhart miscast - Blanchard is meant to be a man with a dark past, and he wasn't dark enough. Hillary Swank was grossly miscast, far worse than Eckhart. She has nothing, NOTHING of the femme fatale, and while in the film her character is often said to be the Dahlia's lookalike, she is nothing like Mia Kirshner. As for Johansonn, I'm not a great fan, and in this film I really can't see what the fuss is all about. Now consider that this quartet of actors move in a EXTREMELY convoluted plot, very hard to follow, and sometimes, especially the women, utter very campy, laughable lines. Add a massive dose of violence, with blood everywhere, and some fight scenes in slow motion à la Walker Texas Ranger. This is the formula of The Black Dahlia. The result? a serious contender to this year Razzie Award, and a major disappointment for moviegoers. If you want my suggestion don't waste your time and money on it.",The Black Dahlia

Maybe the story could have been tighter, maybe he could have reworked the pacing, and left more loose ends untied...The film looks dark as hell, though...Hartnett is slowly becoming one of my favorite I was famous before and now I'm making good movies kinda guy...A like his delivery, his movements...He's better in Slevin, though...Scarlett looks good as usual, and Eckhard convinced me. However, I honestly could have done without Swank...I mean, look...all told, the film isn't spectacular, it's true. It looks and sounds fantastic, a real noir feel, and makes me dream of old Hollywood.I guess that might not be enough, though, in the long run...Maybe I'll read the book, see how that compares...Overall, I'm gonna go with If There's Nothing Else You Think You Wanna Watch More, and leave it at that...",The Black Dahlia
270,lance24,A disaster. The Titanic without a band. Razzies sure to follow.,1,16 September 2006,"If you're hoping to get the Brian DE Palma of ""The Untouchables"" and ""Scarface"", be prepared--this is from DE Palma's ""Femme Fatale"" period and it's not as good. How did one of our greatest directors; one of our greatest writers (James Ellroy) and a top-notch cast team up for such an epic failure? I guarantee that when they hand out the Razzies at the end of the year for the worst cinematic performances of the year--this film will win a bundle.What went wrong? Basically, everything except Mia Kirshner. The movie stumbles out of the gate and never gets a pace or rhythm. There is a long opening which teams up Aaron Eckhart and Josh Hartnett that makes no sense and takes takes up at least 20 minutes of screen time. One could say that so much has been written about the Black Dahlia case that nothing new can be said. Ellroy, who wrote the book on this subject, must know that. The screenplay is no Ellroy novelistic masterpiece; he is clueless writing for the screen. The acting is so bad one would think that it came from an SNL skit rather than the otherwise good actors in the cast. Particularly inept are two-time Academy Award winning actress, Hillary Swank, who never is convincing for one second in an over-the-top vampy turn. This is also Scarlett Johansson's worst work to date. Was she just lucky in ""Lost in Translation""? Everything she's done lately stinks and this is the worst of her recent performances.The movie starts bad and, over time, degenerates into an incomprehensible story which tries to be noirish but is plain laughable. Ellroy tries to weave several themes into the film and none works. Viewers should rent ""True Confessions"" which, despite its flaws, manages to work meaningful symbols and metaphors out of the same Black Dahlia case. While it, too, failed to come close to the fantastic novel on which it was based, no one laughed at the effort.Considering the aspirations this movie had and the talent involved, this is the worst American movie of the year.",The Black Dahlia
271,ParanoidAndroid1982,Good but not good enough,6,24 September 2006,"Firstly, I'd like to say how glad I am to finally see another of James Elroy's books adapted. It's been a while, actually since LA Confidential, since I saw a good movie about this particular era, which interests me a lot. Therefore, I was anxious to see The Black Dahlia, but I have to say I was disappointed with the result. Like LA Confidential, the Black Dahlia has the ambiance and the mystery but unlike LA Confidential, it lacks a good script to hold the story together. The spectator gets lost trying to figure out all the subplots and ends up losing focus of the main story.On the other hand, and in part because of this, the characters seem to be very superficial and detached, preventing the viewer from feeling any kind of emotional feelings for them.This could have been a great film but it seems Brian De Palma was more worried about the technical details and the style of the film than with the story and its characters. Even so, it's a movie worth watching even if just to remember one of the greatest movies from the 90's and the time it portrays, since De Palma doesn't try to detach himself from Curtis Hanson's movie, on the contrary, you kind of see LA Confidential on every scene of The Black Dahlia.",The Black Dahlia

You shouldn't need a degree in Cinema to enjoy a movie.I liked the acting, and I liked all the delightfully quirky characters. That's part of a what a movie should be about, and it's worth seeing just for that, and the somewhat overdone denouement.My first complaint with this film is that I hate it when the producer tints, desaturates or otherwise molests the film itself to create a look. Doesn't anyone else hate the artificiality of it??? A movie ABOUT the 40's doesn't have to look like it was FILMED in the 40's to be authentic. Beautiful actors and actresses whose beauty is hidden behind an overzealous love affair with Photoshop. If you want mood, take some lithium and go stare at a Salvator Dali painting.The other complaint is similar to the first. I found it difficult to get into the movie because everyone seemed so 40's campy in the beginning. Scarlett Johanssen is a marvelous actress but she wiggled her bosom so much in the first 45 minutes I thought Brian stuffed a mouse in her bra. Once she lost the mouse, she was great. Confused, perhaps, but she was supposed to have torn loyalties and that came through clear. And by the way, if any one has some extra lithium, maybe you should toss some Aaron's way.Hilary was great, is she ever not? Fiona is a scene-stealer for sure, and Josh did a yeoman's job keeping everything together. Kudoos, buddy! So my advice to Brian is next time you get the chance, play it straight man and you'd have done so much better! And my advice to anyone who goes to see it...like any mystery movie, pay attention!!

And Fiona Shaw may be the best part of the film, even though she acts as if she's in an entirely different movie - and I think I'd rather watch that one.

276,brad_the_metalhead,very disappointed,3,17 May 2012,"This film is a mess it is all over the place and you can't keep up with it, This film was a big letdown.One of the big things that made me angry was that I turned on this movie expecting it to be all about the Black Dahlia murder and the investigation, but its not, its a complete and utter mess it is very hard to follow, like one minute they are are investigating the murder and the next minute they are talking about some gangster that you don't know anything about, and how a cops relationship with his girlfriend starts to fall apart. I can't express enough how much of a mess this movie is. I was exited when I turned on this movie because it is about a very famous murder and it was Directed by Brian De Palma he is a fantastic director who is known for directing Scarface and Carrie, but honestly I don't know what in the name of god he was thinking with this movie.In my opinion the movie should have a different title because the movie is not really about the murder it is more about the people involved with the case, but it is not mentioned a lot, you briefly see the body and they say how she died but other than that, they show quick clips of what appears to be the victim auditioning for an acting role and later at end when one of the characters admit to killing the women, other than that the movie is just about the surrounding character rather than the actual murder, its just all over the place.Some of the acting in this film is also bad like for example Hilary Swank's character in this film speaks with an accent, and you can tell as soon as she opens her mouth that it is not authentic. Also, the character that confesses to the murder did a terrible acting job it was just horrible thats the best way to put it.I do not recommend this movie at all, its just a giant mess and a big disappointment.",The Black Dahlia
277,Rick_Bman,"An average film, that could have been so much more.",5,2 December 2006,"Well this turned out to be a fairly average movie that had potential to be so much more, which kind of just makes it worse than had it just been a fairly average movie. The movie definitely had its good parts, but over all was not at all put together well.The acting in the film was good for the most part especially Scarlett Johansson, but as anyone that knows me will tell you, I'll watch her in just about anything. Josh Harnett does a passable job as Detective Bucky Bleichert, he didn't pull off the total gritty film noir detective feel, but he wasn't bad either.The film does have an amazing look to it, the costumes and the sets are all just wonderful to look at for the entire film. There is also some amazing camera work and just some really awesome shots in the film. I seem to remember a few long tracking shots in the film that I thought were done really well.Now that I've mentioned the good, let's get on to why the movie doesn't go beyond being an average film. The two basic reasons for this are simple. It really just felt to long, it took to long to get started, and then it took even longer to end. Also it seemed to me that they were trying a little too hard to go for the Film Noir feel. Recreating film noir is not something that is easily done, and very few movies have done it well since the early '50s. This one just doesn't pull it off, but you can tell they are trying really hard.So, the first thing that could have been done to make this film better would have been to remove a lot of the references to the ""Film Noir"" genre. First things first, remove the voice over by Josh Hartnett, it is completely unnecessary and he never seems to tell us anything that we can't figure out on our own from what is on screen. Besides Josh Hartnett just doesn't have the voice for it. I also could have done without a lot of the so called witty banter between some of the characters in the film. It is rarely as witty as the writers seem to think it is, and it definitely doesn't compare to the great dialog in some of the greatest Noirs.This next one is more a staple of older films in general than it is exclusive to Film Noir. They seriously needed to cut it out with the soft focus on Scarlett Johansson's character, Scarlett Johansson is a beautiful woman she doesn't need the soft focus. Of course most actresses back in the '30s, '40s and '50s probably didn't need it either, but they still all had it in their contracts.Next, stop messing with the lighting so much. Film Noirs always had some great lighting techniques, but this movie just went so over the top. Here comes a slight spoiler, at the end of the film when Josh Harnett goes to Scarlett Johannson and she opens the door for him and it is so dark out side where he is and the light inside with her is so blindingly bright (oh yeah, she is in that soft focus again making her look so angelic), that was just a bit over the top. I get the symbolism they were going for, but I didn't need to be beat over the head with it.Now, other than just beating me over the head with the Film Noir references there were a couple other things that bothered me about the film. First off, it took to damn long to get started. I know in the beginning they were trying to really establish a relationship between the two detectives, but it took them just a bit too long. They needed to get to the story quicker.Speaking of the movie taking to long to make its point, how endings did this movie have? I have no problem with complicated endings, and maybe it was just because I was getting bored, but the ending just seemed too convoluted and seemed to go on forever. Here comes another slight spoiler, I really got tired of him figuring everything out, and then suddenly finding another clue and realizing there was another person involved. It really started to make the movie drag for me, as if it wasn't dragging already.Now I know I said in the beginning of this review that most of the acting was good, but there was one performance in the film that I thought was just a bit over the top, and I found it almost laughable. That would be Fiona Shaw as Romona Linscott. I know that she was supposed to be playing a character that was extremely unbalanced and maybe a little crazy, but she went just a bit over board and it often came across as silly to me.So, overall I am not complete sorry I saw the film. I didn't walk out believing I had complete wasted my time or my money. I was probably entertained for most of the time I was sitting there; even if it had its slow parts. During those slow parts, I just spent time admiring the good things about the film. So, I don't regret seeing it but it is probably not something I would go out of my way to see again.",The Black Dahlia
278,Rooster9,A Black Comedy?,5,13 September 2006,"De Palma's staged, theatrical style has always felt like an in-joke: an expressive homage (or sometimes a slap in the face) to the conventions of cinema. And in the case of his high- energy thrillers, the joke is funny and damned entertaining. But in the case of his dramas, De Palma constantly walks a thin line between evocative melodrama and camp (The wonderful ""Carlito's Way,"" in my opinion, is the exception). And ""The Black Dahlia"" often steps over that line. With a steady build-up of noir conventions, the film hearkens to the expressionistic film and acting styles of the 40's -- a style which can induce giggles in audiences raised on irony. And I can count a few musical swells, flamboyant acting choices and dramatic fade-outs which caused unwanted comic relief. Or did it? If there's one thing De Palma loves more than entertaining his audience, it's confounding them. How else do you explain the two-hour joke that was ""Raising Cain""? (Although I, for one, found that particular joke damned funny). You watch ""Dahlia"" with the distinct impression that De Palma is enjoying every minute of it. He's copying Wilder, Welles and, you guessed it, Hitchcock -- and he's having a blast doing it. So when Josh Hartnett's character pulls a full dinner setting (including the turkey) off a table and throws Scarlett Johansson down lustfully upon it, should we also smile and remember ""Double Indemnity""? I guess it would help if you've seen ""Double Indemnity."" That said, the film's biggest flaw is that it smiles at itself for so long that it leaves little time to wrap up the plot. The onslaught of last-reel revelations seems to exist only to give the actors more opportunity to relish in the delicious mood De Palma has created. We never really cared about the plot in the first place because De Palma didn't care about it either. He's more interested in the shadows, the thrills, the drama, the lurking killers, swelling music, lusty confrontations and blood splatters. And the plot points get lost somewhere in the mix. So who can blame us for glazing over when Hartnett finally starts to care about the mysteries rather than just being mystified by them? De Palma has painted such an odd, exciting picture (even when it turns to camp) that the audience would rather keep watching the elaborate set-ups than sit through the convoluted solutions. But then again, what good is a joke without a satisfying punch line?",The Black Dahlia
279,robertblanton,a few good film noirs rolled into one bad one,2,17 September 2006,"Parts of this move kinda make you want to laugh. For instance, seeing K.D. Lang singing lovingly to the audience as the headliner in a swank, upscale lesbian night club (apparently 1947 Hollywood was well represented with swank clubs of this sort), where her entourage sort of melts into a lesbian orgy as part of her act (at least I guess it was supposed to be part of her act).Or, when poor cop Josh Hartnett and socialite Hillary Swank engage in carnal relations in a seedy motel, and afterwards, as he, sitting in bed, is lighting up cigarettes for the two of them while she cuddles near him, is still wearing his fedora while she still wears her pearls. I'll bet keeping that fedora on must have been quite a trick.Anyway, the major problem with this film is that it unsuccessfully tries to combine several film noir classics into one movie. For instance, you have the rich father with the two strange daughters (""The Big Sleep""), the seemingly separate plots that may have more in common than at first glance (""Murder my Sweet""), and the character whose obsession may lead toward a certain road of destruction (""The Postman Always Rings Twice,"" ""Double Indemnity""), etc. What you are left with is a hodgepodge of sometimes incomprehensible threads in which some of the essential characters to the development of the story aren't introduced until near the end of the movie! Another problem with this movie is director Brian De Palma's apparent obsession with lesbians. The movie is basically lesbian this and lesbian that; lesbian singer, lesbian night clubs, lesbian stag films (with device), and lesbian confessions (""I only slept with her once. Honest!""). This film, along with ""Hollywoodland,"" seems intent on informing us uneducated hicks from the heartland that homosexuality existed before 1990. Duu-uuh!!! Now, for the good parts and the trivia parts. One scene consists of two policemen staking out a building where they expect to find a child molester. I'm not going to describe the scene, but it is reminiscent of the famous opening sequence of Orson Welles' ""Touch of Evil."" Mr. De Palma filmed the scene right. Impressive.Though the movie begins to drag when it for too long replaces mystery with romance, the film does have one really good scene of unrelenting Hitchcock-like suspense.The photography is first rate and beautiful.The classic cars are a wonder to behold.Some of the music score reminds one of the works of film composer Bernard Herrman.Two trivia items: The marquee of one movie theater advertises ""The Black Angel,"" a 1947 film noir based upon the novel by Cornell Woolrich (""Rear Window""), who is considered to be one of the founders of this genre of suspense.One scene in this film shows the action through the eyes of Josh Hartnett. You do not see him; you see only the faces of those he is talking with as the camera turns from individual to individual, showing us all through Hartnett's eyes. This device was previously used for almost an entire film by Robert Montgomery (Elizabeth's dad) when he played Philip Marlowe in ""Lady in the Lake."" (No, that inferior, insipid, little horror movie was not the first to use this device. Sorry!) So, I am guessing that Mr. De Palma was paying homage to film noirs of the past. Too bad he didn't wait until he had better material to do it with.Your better bets: Everything mentioned above.",The Black Dahlia
280,jse126,The what?,2,1 March 2007,"It's hardly even about the murder case, a fact that I found out later. I can't really say what this film is about - it just sorta sits there on the screen and stuff happens but there is not much of a point to any of it and the viewer has nothing to grab hold of. I mean, it is about the case, but not really. If that does not make sense then you must indulge me, because it is an apt description of this turkey. It's a muddled, dull and unfocused affair with no focal point. I almost never review a film that I did not watch until the very end, but I had ordered this on cable and had 24 hours to watch it - and after two separate viewings and with about twenty minutes left I simply did not care enough to complete it and the 24 hours expired. That pretty much says it all.",The Black Dahlia
281,ca_dale,A disjointed mess of a film,5,16 December 2007,"The Black Dahlia (TBD) is a tribute of sorts to the film noir flicks prevalent during its 1940's setting. Visually the film is quite stunning. De Palma and crew have done an excellent job creating the look of the period. This combined with creative camera work helps shape numerous memorable and inviting images. The jazzy musical score is also a great complement to the frequently dark, unsettling visuals.But all of this glitz is overshadowed by the fact that TBD lacks any sort of discernible plot or character development. It starts feeling extremely rushed right out of the gate, cutting from scene to scene at break-neck speed, with only a few quick snippets of voice over from Bleichert (Josh Harnett) to try and guide us through the overload of seemingly random content. The direction and pacing is never really clear or coherent. My guess is that Brian De Palma had an ambitious idea here, but just couldn't seem to make it click within the film's running time and tried to compensate by cramming in as much content as possible at the expense of appropriate pacing.The rest of the cast brings little to the mix. Aaron Eckhart plays Hartnett's partner, Lee Blanchard. The twosome shares a home with a female acquaintance of Lee's named Kay Lake (Scarlett Johansson), whom both have a competing attraction to. The film attempts to utilize this love triangle dynamic as a parallel to the murder, with Lee becoming obsessed with the Dahlia case and turning abusive and unstable. The problem is that we are not given enough insight into either of these characters to care about them. We are just sort of expected to accept that they are troubled without being told why. Aside from looks Scarlett Johansson has no endearing quality in this film either. Her delivery comes across as unenthusiastic and underwhelming. Like Eckart, her character is one dimensional and fails to leave a lasting impression on us.Once the Black Dahlia murder comes into play, the film switches gears and just sort of coasts along through the mid section, not really sure of what to do with itself. The murder investigation takes a back seat to the incoherent assortment of domestic problems between Bleichert, Lee, and Kay. After a series of interrogations and meeting which don't seem to lead anywhere, Bleichert abruptly pieces bits of the mystery together and rushes from local to local to pursue his suspects. I was continually left scratching my head over what he'd figured out and how he'd gotten there. And while the film tries to give us a conclusion to the chase, it again brings us no closer to interpreting the assortment of events leading up to it in any sort of coherent way. The film ends rather anti-climatically as well, but by that time I was just glad to be done with it.",The Black Dahlia
282,PDXozoner,This is Your Brian on Drugs...,2,25 July 2007,"This is a rare work of art in which the goddesses Chaos and Lethargy compete, listlessly, for your attention. Somewhere in here is a decent film noir mystery, but it's suffocated by atmospherics and confused by incoherence. It makes you wonder if Brian DePalma could have been quaffing codeine toking torpedoes, and lapping down 'ludes through the whole process.The performances range from overwrought to under-baked with very little in between. Hillary Swank does a dirty Kate Hepburn, badly. Fiona Shaw channels Bette Davis, grotesquely. Scarlett Johannson mimes Lana Turner, stiffly. And, in one of the very few bright spots, Josh Hartnett bares his bum, too briefly.I watched this thing all the way through because I was ill and I was too uninvolved to change the channel. When it was over, I couldn't decide which I needed more- a nap, a drink, or a shower.One of the 500+ other reviewers says he gave Black Dahlia four stars in a generous mood. I feel the same way about giving it two.",The Black Dahlia
283,mk4,more. More. MORE!,9,16 September 2006,"As a 4th Generation Angeleno, all I can say is the De Palma/Friedman interpretation of Ellroy's ""Black Dahlia"" is way too tame. We want our decadence, our hop heads, street brawls, crooked fights, dyke bars, corrupt cops, crime figures and dirty D.A.s portrayed over the top, and in this aspect De Palma succeeds. But anyone who's read the fictional account of Elizabeth short's gruesome death knows that Officer Blanchard's obsessive benzedrine-fueled quest for the facts spun ever crazier and out of control. (Possible Spoilers): His ramshackle apartment ""House-Of-Horrors"" profiler/shrine composed of official police photos and morgue shots of Short was only hinted at in the film. When the room was finally entered by Bleichert, the movie should have really begun to ramp-up by taking the audience into a dizzying, visually stunning and nightmarish camera pan around the room showing how truly Blanchard's mind had deteriorated in his manic pursuit of the truth. But De Palma never explored this important section of the novel, so we were never completely swept up in Lee Blanchard's own special brand of drug-induced insanity so vital to that whole unique brand of Dahlia murder madness. Here's where the movie could have turned frantic, as we all could collectively mainline on Blanchard's, and later Bleichert's monomania. Yes, I believe the film could have dispensed with a lot of the Kay Lake/ Bucky Bliechert love interludes at this point enabling the movie could have sped along to it's frightening conclusion, but in today's Hollywood, good editing is as rare as sincerity. That being said, those critics who carp about references to clown paintings fail to note that ""The Man Who Laughs"" is featured prominently throughout the film as one of the fiend's primary inspirations for the method of Short's torture resulting in her grinning death mask. Hugo's book was a key piece of the puzzle in the novel, along with the twisted paintings of the tragic Gwynplaine character himself. De Palma's film goes Ellroy's novel one better by showing actual clips of the 1928 Universal film of ""The Man who Laughs"" (which is extremely unnerving, and just maybe more horrific in its own right!) to set up the denouement. What Bleichert actually discovers in the Hollywoodland murder house itself (as told by Ellroy in the novel) would really send moviegoers home in a lather if allowed in the film. The actual slaying in the film--although crazed by today's standards--is not thoroughly horrific enough to convey the brutality inflicted upon the torso of the helpless Short. The Black Dahlia Murder, and Elizabeth Short herself, have a reckless, illogical way of grabbing hold of the psyche of anyone who has ever become familiar with the case. Even the passing of 60 years fails to diminish the hypnotic hold that the mugshots, the 25 cent photos, the tabloids, the headlines, the murder notes and the morgue shots this tragic brunette with the curious crooked smile still inflicts upon the smitten. I wanted De Palma to nail it. De Palma almost captures it... nearly succeeds...but comes up short. 9 out of 10 *s.",The Black Dahlia
284,guitarcarl,Disjointed Disconnected and Disappointing,3,17 December 2006,"I guess I would have understood this more if I had known the movie actually had almost nothing to do with the real Black Dahlia murder. It's a completely fictional story that makes no attempt what so ever to answer any of the many questions surrounding the actual Black Dahlia murder.There has to be literally hundreds of factual stories surrounding this murder that would have made for a vastly better story line. It was so complicated I had trouble remembering who was supposed to have done what. The connections between characters were unnatural. The chemistry was stretched and strained. The movie does not work on so many levels that it would be difficult to comment about them all.There are some really terrific movies that cover true crime in a dramatic way, for example ""In Cold Blood."" The difference is that in the case of movies like ""In Cold Blood"" the fictional aspects of the script are in place to build pace and to condense complex events so that viewers can draw conclusions accurately with out making the movie last forever. However, ""The Black Dahlia"" does just the opposite. The silly love triangles and complex character associations lead you further and further away from the facts of the murder until it has to take tremendous leaps in story development in the last half hour to sum up a climax that makes almost no sense.Another thing that bothered me quite a bit about the story was the defamation of Elizabeth Short's character and reputation. She was never known to be in any lesbian relationships in real life. Nor was she in any porn films. There is little evidence that she was nearly so sexually promiscuous. In this way I felt like this poor young woman who was so horribly murdered was simply victimized again by a novel and script writer that were lazy and or untalented. They just danced on her grave to make a buck. Difficult for me to understand that with a case that is loaded with good story possibilities without making the victim into a slut.",The Black Dahlia

Film bore more like,1,18 May 2008,"Right, I'll start with the good bits; the sets are alright, Josh Hartnett and Scarlett Johansson look pretty.The bad: One of only two films that i've never finished watching, (the other being Nixon, but let's not talk about that, it will bring me down even more).I tried, i really really tried, but this film is so dull it should come with a warning. I've never seen a film with a more complex story in which absolutely nothing happens. On paper the cast is strong but the script is so flat, lifeless, confused and unsure of direction that none of them puts in anything approaching a decent performance.I got to within 10 minutes of the end, but even that knowledge - i was so close - wasn't motivation enough to watch this utterly banal monstrosity.

I can't even say that, while watching it, I was hoping that it would get better, in that the writing was on the wall from early going. This is a classic example of going for style over substance, as it is a film that looks good, but that's about it. The acting, aside from the usually reliable Aaron Eckhart and the underused Mia Kirshner, was pedestrian, at best. This film desperately needed an energy that someone like Josh Hartnett seems impossible to give. While he, and Scarlett Johnansson, are not awful in it, neither did they add anything significant...aside from, perhaps, drawing more people in to watch it with their celebrity status. In the end, maybe that's all the studio truly cared about.",The Black Dahlia
287,jmtsund,A decent and quite enjoyable DePalma noir movie.,6,2 October 2020,"This film has gotten its fair share of flak. Some of it I can understand and agree with. Some of it not. It has flaws in the script and (in parts) the acting. On the other hand I personally think that some of the acting is more than ok. Hartnett is quite believable in his role and so are actresses Hillary Swank and Scarlett Johansson. Aaron Eckhart is perhaps a tad over the top but that could as well be due to the script and/or the directing. The supporting cast is also within the acceptable range. I can live with it (performance-wise).I haven´t read the book, so I have no sense of the source material and I cannot therefore compare the script with the book. The script has flaws but holds up just about enough for me to buy into the story and the events that takes place. I found it hard not to be engaged. I really wanted the murder to be solved. My biggest issue with the script is that I think there are way to many sub plots going on. There are like three, four stories evolving at the same time. If the film had focused more on the actual murder investigation and the police work, maybe it would have been better received. And why does Hartnetts character have to go on a shagging spree in many a scenes?Brian DePalma has all through his career been criticized for not having his ""own"" style and for imitating others (primarily Hitchcock). I don´t agree and I don´t care for the criticism. Be that as it may or may not; Personally I am very fond of his sense of style. And there is plenty of that style here. So for those DePalma aficionados out there, there is plenty to enjoy.This film has suspense, drama, shoot-outs, gruesome murders, romance/misogyny, crane shots and what have you. I have it in my collection and I will now and again go back and rewatch it.A solid film noir thriller that will entertain (some of) you a rainy night.",The Black Dahlia
288,northwatuppa,"A surprisingly bad movie, a big disappointment",5,28 December 2006,"This movie doesn't hang together. The talent, the money, the experience, the story ... they are all there. But they don't combine to produce an interesting movie. In fact, they produce a dry and tedious one.You never really get to know the characters, let alone care about them. The movie as a whole has no single, driving motive force. The scenes seem kind of tacked together. The characters just kind of do things and talk about them. But there is no emotional coherence to their actions. There really doesn't seem any reason why one action or one scene flows from another. It is often hard to tell why things happen.Certain key scenes, in my opinion, were simply incomprehensible. You don't know why they occurred when they did. You don't know what happened in them, not really. And the movie as a whole is so uninteresting, so uninvolving that you don't really care enough to figure it out.There is no ambiance. Strange, since film noir is all about atmospherics and Hollywood in the forties is drenched in ambiance. You'd think they'd at least get the atmospherics right. Nope.After awhile, you just sit there tallying up De Palma's allusions to other films, including his own. There are lots of them.This is a badly anemic film. Almost all of what makes a film move and breathe and cast a spell over an audience is absent from it.A true bummer of a film experience.Art Linson produced it, which makes it an even greater disappointment. Linson and De Palma teamed up to create The Untouchables, one of De Palma's greatest films and one of my all time favorites.I really like De Palma, even when he's sort of over the top in a bad way. This wasn't even one of his good bad films. It is just bad. I hope he gets his groove back soon.I suppose people will watch it because it is such a big name film, but they'd probably be better off renting something else.",The Black Dahlia
289,peter-1850,"Sloppy, complicated and silly",2,28 October 2006,"We went to see this today. The sets were very good, and the photography well done. The dildo, that turned up rather surprisingly at one point, was quite elegant - I hadn't seen an art deco one before.The film did rather drag, though, and the plot was far too complex and implausible - this is particularly obvious at the end where, like a badly done Agatha Christie play, all the characters had to explain what they did in great detail whilst being held at gunpoint. The characters motivation isn't plausible - why paint a portrait of yourself at the murder scene, for example? There were a few anachronisms. People in the '40s certainly didn't talk about old people as 'senior citizens' that's a very recent ugliness that, even now, only very peculiar politically correct types would use - and even then, I'd imagine, with a certain irony. There were a few other spoken anachronisms that I don't recall.In the 1940s, what is now called a disco ball, the ball studded with small mirrors, would have been found in a few night clubs (they were invented in the '20s), but not in an elegant tea dancing room.There were some scenes that were simply silly. The only reason that I could see for an hallucinatory episode near the end was to show off the body that they'd made again, it made no other sense that I could detect.I see that IMDb lists another ten or so anachronisms. This is really very sloppy. On the other hand, it was a film that encouraged you to look for anachronisms so as to pass the time.I'm not sure why, but the sound wasn't very good either, voices were often muffled, and indistinct.I'm not sure why they didn't send this straight to DVD.",The Black Dahlia
290,Jackie-Kennedy,The Black Dahlia .............Nothing stays hidden forever.....,10,1 March 2007,"It amazes me how people claiming to be able to properly review a film can only say about The Black Dahlia ""It was too confusing"" or ""I couldn't follow the plot"". My view is that people were mislead by the title into assuming that the Black Dahlia murder itself was to be main focus, which any true McEllroy and De Palma fans will tell you is not and was not ever the case. These people then decided they weren't going to enjoy the film, zoned out and complained that it was hard to follow!! Well let me tell you if you like your films intelligent, dark, atmospheric and emotionally charged this is most definitely the one for you.The plot of course centers on LAPD Officers Dwight 'Bucky' Bleichart( Josh Harnett) and Leland 'Lee' Blanchard( Aaron Eckhart) aka Mr.Ice and Mr.Fire respectively due to their boxing skills and the tale is told by Bucky ( in voice-overs) The film's backdrop is the horrific and now infamous murder rising star Elizabeth'Beth'Shortt( Mia Kershner) aka 'The Black Dahlia' whose disfigured mutilated remains were found in August 1947 by a woman walking her baby in downtown L.A. Our two protagonists are called in to investigate the crime which was so horrible that all the details were kept from the public.While Lee and Bucky go all out to solve the heinous crime each is also dealing with his personal issues. Lee's growing obsession with the case threatens his relationship with his girlfriend Kay ( Scarlett Johanssen). Added to the strain is the eminent release of Bobby De Witt whom Lee had previously put behind bars for numerous crimes including some close to home. Bucky meanwhile finds himself entwined in a love-affair with wealthy if rebellious Madeline Linscott(Hilary Swank) who bears an uncanny resemblance to Beth Shortt, while also dealing with his feelings for Kay.Special mention to Aaron Eckhart's pitiful obsessed yet tragic portrayal of Blanchard whose dedication to the case proves his undoing.Josh Harnett is on top form as the narrator Bucky, the new recruit struggling with his feelings for Kay and Madeline while trying to keep his partner together. He portrays Bucky's struggles and angst perfectly.Scarlett Johanssen is currently the sweetheart of Hollywood and it's easy to see why. Not only has she the beauty of all those old 40s sirens but she plays Kay with the skills of a woman twice her age. She is both headstrong and lost. The electricity between her and Bucky is palpable. Hilary Swank is the mysterious heiress to whom Bucky is drawn. Her Madeline is a strong woman with a dark side to her and Hilary captures it perfectly.Beth Shortt we get to know through interviews with acquaintances and screen test recordings featuring the beautiful Mia Kershner as the doomed 'Dahlia'. Mia portrays Beth as a lost frightened little girl who feels she has to sell herself to be. She is a beautiful and tragic figure. A perfect performance.This is an intense atmospheric thriller that catches you from the word go and doesn't let you unhook yourself till the end credits. The performances are passionate and captivating.The 40s style Cinematography is beautiful and atmospheric with a Film Noir quality.The story is full of side plots and twists to keep the viewer on his/her toes. While some may call it confusing and unwatchable I say you simply need to have enough of a brain to be able to think it through logically.The 1940s style cinematography is beautiful and gives the film a dark atmospheric edge and the acting is superb. De Palma keeps faithful to McEllroy's excellent novel but gives the story an energy and intense emotional drive that can only be given on screen.This is definitely a film I would recommend as a must-see to anyone who likes a good thriller.Remember that the 'Dahlia'herself is not the main focus of the film, since Ellroy's book was not focused solely on her. Rather she is the catalyst for the all the events following the murder.Just keep an open mind and rather than being put off by the focus of the story think it through logically and you won't have a problem understanding anything. ***** 10/10",The Black Dahlia
291,zephyr-123,Sloppy confusing mess. . .,2,14 November 2007,"Basically this a movie that took the name of ""The Black Dahlia"" to deceive people into thinking they would see a movie about the murder of Elizabeth Short (in order to sell it) only to find it's a movie about two guys and their private lives involving stories (fictionalized) that have incredibly little to do with the Black Dahlia murder. After the murder, a whole slew of people contacted the police department either claiming to be the killer or knowing who it was. Does the movie show this? No. After the murder, someone sent letters to the police department taunting them. Does the movie show this? No. Does the movie get into the top prime suspects of the case? No. The Black Dahlia murder is presented in sparse snippets of background information (like a background set) with a ludicrous scenario at the end to explain who killed her. The truth is, no one knows for sure who killed her which is how the movie should have ended because it would reflect the truth. The only parts of the movie that were interesting to me are the clips of screen tests (created by Josh Friedman) which are fabricated but at least they attempt to give Elizabeth Short some presence. Also, the one scene that shows the discovery of Elizabeth Short's body is not only the best scene in the film but probably one of the best scenes I've ever seen played out in a film. Though Brian DePalma may be an excellent director and some of the movie is well executed, I (like many people on the message board) felt hugely disappointed getting a story that purports to be one thing and turns out to be something that felt pointless to watch. It's not the only movie with ""Black Dahlia"" in the title and in checking those movies out, I'm finding similar scenarios. Why are movie makers using this woman in the titles of their movies that have nothing to do with her? What's the deal with Hollywood? Why won't they tell this woman's story instead of using her to sell other crap (as if the real story isn't fascinating enough)? On the bonus features of the DVD James Ellroy talks about his life and why he is fascinated with and creates crime stories. I haven't read any of his books but have heard comments on the message board from others and it sounds like he is a talented writer but when he says he wanted to ""honor Elizabeth Short"" I was like ""Huh?"". How is depicting this woman as being a big whore sleeping with everyone (truth is Elizabeth Short had a genital defect that interfered with her ability to have sex) and a woman who made porn movies (never happened) ""Honoring"" her? It's lying about her, trashing her reputation much in the same way newspapers did in the day of her death sixty years ago. Another problem I had with it was the tangled mess of plots, sub-plots and sub-sub-sub-plots that made little sense, didn't connect up and only served to confuse. According to accounts of poster's comments on the message board, in leaving the theater, they overheard many audience members mumbling ""What happened?"" and asking each other to explain what was going on only to be met with similar confusion from their friends. I gave it two stars simply because I could find no fault with the actors in the same way many people who didn't like the movie did. They did the best they could with what they had to work with and employed the appropriate acting techniques in conveying the film noir style which, imo, is something that many audience members mistakenly misinterpreted as bad acting.I rented it thinking I was going to get a lot of info about Elizabeth Short--what kind of person she was, testimonies of people who knew her or met her, her family, what her activities were before her death, etc. I wanted to see the cops going through the evidence trying to find out who did it (Something similar to a CSI of the 40's kind of thing or perhaps in the way ""The Zodiac"" was done). I wanted to see what the cops of that department went through (based on the actual history of the case) in trying to solve it. I wanted a realistic historically accurate treating of this horrible senseless murder, something that would show who Elizabeth Short was and why after all these years people still care about what happened to her. Instead of what would have been a fascinating truth, I got a boring lie which didn't need to in any way be connected to Elizabeth Short's story to be told. What I'd like to ask the people who made this movie is, why did you throw away the compelling true story over the fictionalized and uninspiring one? To people interested in Elizabeth Short and her murder, you are better off checking out some of the available documentaries on either CourtTV or A&E, reading books about the case or sites devoted to her .",The Black Dahlia
292,info-3508,Analysis into the bad...,3,17 November 2012,"I have been studying ""The Black Dahlia"" to understand what went wrong. The main characters are flat. Even less prominent characters are like wallpaper. They are simply not engaging. The actors seem to have been selected for their looks, not their internalization of the roles. Their performances do not capture the times, and thus are not adequately developed and authentic, more like caricatures.The costumes were well-selected and the locations were brilliant. I wish other elements of ""The Black Dahlia"" connected in this way.The plot zigzags with convoluted subplots, like a story looking for direction and purpose, never finding it. Nearly every scene explains events, rather than depicting them. The horrific and infamous death of Elizabeth Short, instead of serving as the primary theme, comes across as mere inconvenience to all who stumble around it.The tone of the movie is odd. The lesbian club scene with K. D. Lang panders with over-the- top camp, and takes the viewer out of the story. It could have, instead, served as an opportunity to offer something meaningful about homosexuality in post-WWII Los Angeles. The camera work during the Linscott pre-dinner is completely out of sync with the rest of film. The dinner scene, instead of inciting dread, plays out like black comedy. Even the confrontations in the third act are more humorous and campy than effectively dramatic.The movie eliminates the subtle, heroic qualities Bleichert, and those of the broken Blanchard, found in the James Ellroy novel upon which this movie is based. Ellroy's Elizabeth Short is as cunning as she is desperate. Kay Lake is the true genius, and Madeleine is a villainess one cannot help but find at once curious, charismatic and loathsome. These masterful dimensions are unfortunately lost in the film.""The Black Dahlia"" could have been something special. Ellroy's novel is provocative and compelling. Perhaps in different hands, Ellroy's deft, albeit fictionalized, vision of this notorious, mysterious and brutal crime might be properly realized.",The Black Dahlia

I saw the film, was paying attention...and I have to tell you I'm still not sure what the hell happened. This is the kind of film there CANNOT BE SPOILERS because the film SPOILS ITSELF. I'll not get into the story line here as I'm assuming you already know it, and if you don't, many of the other reviews will cover it. I'll just concentrate on why I feel anyone who goes to see this film will need to see another film immediately following it to get the bad taste out of their mouths. The title itself is misleading because the Black Dahlia case seems to be the last thing on the film's mind. It's got lots of other characters and subplots going on and seems to almost be pulled kicking and screaming back to the story the title promised everyone at the door. It might not had been such a circuitous bore if the stories were interesting, or the actors watchable, but it's a major negative on both counts here...whoever is sleeping with Josh Hartnett must be way up the Hollywood food chain because how this wooden no talent department store dummy keeps getting starring parts in films is beyond me - even more so than what the hell was going on in this film. I imagine that sooner or later Josh Hartnett and Kate Bosworth will make a film together - they'll call it WITHOUT A PULSE. I know it's hard to find the next batch of movie stars, but really, I'm assuring you, you can move on from Harnett.Strangely, Mia Kirshner who plays Elizabeth Short - The Black Dahlia herself - seems to be the only one in the whole film with a pulse! I wanted more of her, and a whole lot less of everyone else. This film even managed to make Aaron Eckhart boring...and he's been riveting in everything I've seen him in besides this. Scarlett Johansson's Kay too is upstaged by Kirshner.Visually speaking, just think really dark and brown and you've got an image of the film in your head. It's hard to judge different aspects of a film when the mixture of it all is just such a diminished return, but somewhere someone thought that shooting in Easter Europe of Los Angeles would work if you just turned off all the lights, cast a boring actor and hoped the audience went to sleep. This baby played at the Venice Film Festival - as if we don't have enough ill will toward the United States going already.The Black Dahlia murder is a famous unsolved Los Angeles crime that will never be forgotten - this film will be forgotten even before the DVD release.",The Black Dahlia

She has about 8 minutes of screen time. And that's it for the good stuff.The rest of the film is an incomprehensible mess having very little to do with the Black Dahlia murder. It's well shot and beautifully composed for the most part......but the plot points and discoveries the characters make just don't add up at all!

De Palma brilliantly captures the film noir form and the feel of the 40's. The film is almost a masterclass in film-making.What lets it down big-time is the mis-casting of Josh Hartnett in the lead role of detective Bucky Bleichert. Josh does his best, but his limited acting skills are painful to watch and ultimately a turn-off to the whole film. He is unable to act with his face, having 2 stolid expressions only, and unable to subtly express his underlying emotions. His scene with Scarlett Johansson towards the end is an embarrassing comparison for Josh.There are large slabs of the film where all we see is his face, and I think of what Javier Bardem or Anthony Hopkins (or indeed a host of very good actors) would have done with their faces to capture our attention and keep us involved.In the extras to the blu ray De Palma explains that he cast Josh because he came across as able to depict sincerity etc. Well he certainly does that, but it's not visually interesting or engaging at all (see what Sergio Leone does with faces).This film has a low score, and there are a lot of comments about other aspects of the film. For example, Scarlett's use of a cigarette holder is deplored (better throw out Roberta (Ginger Rogers) and The Picture of Dorian Grey and All About Eve (George Sanders) as well).I thing most of the negative comments follow from the poor performance of Josh Hartnett.I think this film would have been brilliant if the main lead could act - it would be a difficult part, and requires a high competence in acting. But it would have made the film, as all the other elements are already there.It's a greatly missed opportunity. I take 5 points off for the casting of Josh Hartnett, and rate it 5 points for high class production values. I will keep my blu ray, as there is enough good stuff on it to use as A-B comparisons with other films - in future it's a fast forward exercise for the good bits - worth a look for production values.",The Black Dahlia
296,jeremy corbett UK,Crazy - and not in a good way,2,11 June 2007,"Wasn't author James Ellroy obsessed by the lurid Black Dahlia case for years before he wrote his book? I haven't had the pleasure of reading the novel, but this expensively-mounted DePalma flick is ultimately pointless in every sense, and gives little hint that anyone involved cared one iota.With 'Mission to Mars' the story was to say the least, a little lacking, and with this, DePalma opts not to connect with the 'Black Dahlia' murder on any meaningful level, and instead makes the regrettable decision to film a script which begins with a pointless preamble, and inexplicably veers into an irrelevant, distracting and convoluted series of sub-plots which finally add up to so little it's actually embarrassing: 'She looks just like that dead girl' indeed. Once again DePalma has been a magpie with other movies and there's nothing implicitly wrong with that, but here he's fashioned an overlong and unfocused mess from his borrowings: 'LA Confidential' it is not. This doesn't amount to a Noir picture just because it features a femme-fatale and a hard-boiled voice over. As it happens, no 'Noir' device is left untouched, but it's all too artful and knowing to be considered representative of the genre.My advice is keep your expectations low. Imagine 'Sin City' meets '1941', such is the level of miscalculation on the the film-makers' part. 'Chinatown'? You actually believed Los Angeles was corrupt in that picture, so convincing was its evocation of time and place, but this turkey has you racking your brains to decide which decade it's meant to be set in. The film is constantly undermined by baffling anachronisms, as if the writer deliberately chose to ignore the period: The wholly unbelievable milieu of racy Hollywood lesbians and wealthy perverts rings so false that when k.d. lang pops up, you know that the problem is DePalma.The two male leads (ahem, Fire and Ice!)are entirely unconvincing as detectives; DePalma's gallery of grotesque characters may all be in authentic wardrobe, but not one of them has a good reason for delivering such bizarrely over-the-top screen performances. This theatricality may be intentional, but it needs a robust story to withstand an interpretation of this sort, and the story at the centre of DePalma's film is weak, weak, weak. Scarlett Johansson's performance is so poorly directed, she should sue. Her verdict is that she was not right 'physically' for the role, whatever that means.Doubtless we're failing to recognise a classic of the future. If ever DePalma gets the status afforded to Hitchcock in later years, then this film could become his 'Vertigo', as there are some moments of pure cinema where DePalma finally gets around to moving his camera to create some tension in the story. From the perspective of 2007 though, it looks like another disappointing misfire which doesn't have that much to say. Sorry, Brian; Compare 'Carlito's Way' and despair.",The Black Dahlia

As a staple of movie channel weekends, it has become a guilty pleasure, and many of the qualities that repelled contemporary reviewers have aged into respectability.
Yes, the dialogue is turgid and the performances alternately wooden and overdone. Yes, the female characters are caricatures of male fantasies. Yes, the costuming and art direction favor gorgeousness over believability. But these stylized mannerisms are exactly what make this film feel like a 40's studio film noir, rather than a 21st-century meta-noir. ""LA Confidential"" is one of my all-time favorites, and this is no ""LA Confidential,"" but they are attempting different things. ""LAC"" would have baffled a 1940's audience; ""Dahlia"" could have run as second billing with any number of solid, enjoyable noirs from back in the day.
Brian DePalma alternately annoys the heck out of me with his frequently lazy craft and impresses me with his occasionally brilliant style and ambition. ""The Black Dahlia"" is not a masterpiece, but DePalma is a better director than most, and he has done far worse.",The Black Dahlia

Probably an editor's nightmare (or would that be an editor's real-life noir?).The parts that I did like were the film-in-film vignettes of the Short auditions. Mia Kirshner did an exceptional job in embracing the gamut of emotions in a dream-not-come-true life. These were echoed, with a certain muted success in the actions, motivations, sadness, and depravity of the other characters.I believe that this theme was pretty faithful to the sentiments of the Ellroy novel.

Josh Hartnett and Aaron Eckhart played two Los Angeles Police Department detectives attempting to solve the murder of the Black Dahlia. The film focused on how both officer's obsessions changed their lives. Josh and Aaron both played out that roles magnificently. It made it seem that the movie came to life.The plot of the story was really disappointing. Like I said before, rather than focusing the movie on the investigation, it focused more on the lives of the two LAPD detectives.

The acting in the main parts leaves a great deal to be desired and by far the more interesting of the male leads dies long before the end. But there are enough incidental pleasures to make it worth seeing. The crystalline black and white screen-test sequences are gorgeous to look at, and even greater interest lies in the performances of the film's actresses, whose fascination is in inverse proportion to the amount of time they spend on the screen: Scarlett Johansson is hopeless, and while Hilary Swank at least gives it her best shot trying to evoke the femmes fatales of the film noir heyday, she too is miscast. Much better is Mia Kirshner who lends a mesmeric power to the B&W sequences mentioned earlier, and while Fiona Shaw makes a bold bid to steal the movie with an outrageously over-the top performance, she is outdone by Rose McGowan who upstages the lot of them in her tiny part as an actress playing Cleopatra!",The Black Dahlia

Expectation... Curtis Hanson did an excellent job with L.A. Confidential, so why not? - And now I've seen the result of DePalma's work. First of all, don't even compare it with the L.A. Confidential movie. Black Dahlia is told in a radical different way, being much more synthetic, expressive and theatrical. This is not a very common way of telling stories in modern movies, however this method made me recall the typical 'over-acting' as seen in the 40's noir movies (like Double Indemnity). Was this intentionally? - Probably, yes. It feel a bit weird to begin with, but at the end of the show I had to admit: It works. The movie clearly tries to describe all the details from the book, which sometimes makes it loose its own breath. The original story had so many details, and took place over a very long period of time. This is one of the points where the movie sometimes stumble. It's simply trying too hard. One thing that is hard to criticize is the stunning visuals. The movie is absolutely beautiful, making every scene a work of art.

A person who is interested in a fictional solution to the case would be much better off reading "" Angel In Black "" written by Max Allan Collins.

310,fuzzysham13,Black Dahlia - the flower of death,7,30 September 2006,"The Black Dahlia ... interesting title. A dahlia is a flower of the daisy family. It possibly foreshadows most of the eventsBrian De Palma is a very good director. None of the techniques he used were original. He was paying homage to all of his idols. I think he did it very well. Hitchcock, Welles, Wilder each have individual styles, and De Palma has been inspired by them each and uses their style to make his own.Personally, I would consider this film noir. Not like the old school film noir but sort of a new type. De Palma used heavy shadows through out most of the film. But what makes it ""new school"" is the fact that it is in color. In a way it makes perfect sense. For those who do not know, film noir was a term used by the French for American detective movies in the 40s and 50s that were pessimistic and had a lot of death. Certainly, this film has those elements.The casting did very good job of choosing the actors and actresses they did. Josh Hartnett has played a couple of roles as that 40s semi-dirty cop (Sin City). He does a very good job of portraying emotion. Through out the movie you can tell by his body language that he likes Scarlette Johannsson's character. Scarlett Johannsson almost did a very good job in her role. Swank, was excellent as the rich bi-sexual slut that knew it all but though she was too good to be caught. Swank was very attractive in her little black dress cut low on her hips.Overall, this film wasn't bad. As my rating shows, I rather enjoyed it. The story line was interesting and a little complicated. The characters were realistic, and very flawed. The settings were well crafted. The actors did a very good job.

I really think De palma missed the boat on this one. The main thing which could really scare us was the mutilated dead body of Elizabeth Short, to bring home the point of how horrific this murder was, but we see the body all of like 5 seconds in total, and in a really anti-climatic way.It could have been so good.I am a huge Brian DePalma fan but I found myself stunned by how uninteresting this adaptation was.

Maybe that's part of the reason I disliked this movie as much as I did. However if this movie is any indicator to the quality of the novel I don't think I'll read it.The Black Dahlia is loosely based upon the murder of actress Elizabeth Short which was adapted into a novel by James Ellroy (I've never read any books by him so I won't be bringing him or his novels into this). When watching the movie it became painfully obvious that the murder was not to be the focus of the movie. Which in my opinion is a huge mistake. Instead, what you get instead of a taut murder mystery (which is what I expected to see!) you get a melodramatic film-noir movie that ultimately aspires to put people asleep or completely turn them off to smoking.I don't know where the blame should lie for this train wreck of a movie. But just so no one feels left out I shall bring the writer, director and actors into this. The writing for the movie is fairly decent, at face value does what a lot of other noir movies have done in the past. The set designs looked fantastic, and did a good job of capturing the look of the forties (not that I was alive during that decade, hurray books) rather well. But it must be pointed out that the movie should've focused primarily on the murder of Elizabeth Short and not made it a subplot to the sex life of Josh Hartnett. More than an hour passes by when they just focus on the fact that Josh Hartnett was a boxer and fought against Aaron Eckhart and that he has slowly but surely lost it and becomes obsessed with the Dahlia and Bobby DeWitt or that he secretly loved Scarlett Johannson, but is currently involved in a steamy affair with Hillary Swank.At more than one point during the movie I seriously considered walking out, but I couldn't justify it. Just when the movie did start to get interesting the movie ended. So after a near two and a half hours of continual boredom I was left with a feeling of anger and remorse. Anger at the fact that I wasted near ten bucks on this movie. And remorse for the fact that I could've used that same amount of money and rented a better movie instead. This movie fails on just about every level. Even the sex scene with Scarlett Johannson (who happens to be one of my favorite actresses) fails to titillate, and it just bothered me that Hillary Swank was in this movie (despite what many people say, this reviewer finds her to be most unattractive).If you've read the book, you'll probably enjoy it. If you're a huge fan of film-noir and aren't expecting that much of a murder mystery movie, you'll probably enjoy it. I just cannot recommend this movie to anyone.

314,markkp,Waste of talent. Disrespectful of dead victim. And silly.,1,28 September 2006,"De Palma's typically undisciplined style has boomeranged. In the theater, we heard nervous titters of laughter at the histrionics that passed for acting, the wild twists and turns of a plot which finally just implodes, and the general over-the-topness of it all. A sad waste of money and talent. De Palma is a director who sometimes brings out the worst in actors (Pacino in Carlito's Way and many others.) That's a shame. There is a lot of talent on screen here, but the script was a disaster of truly epic proportions. This is not an homage to noir, but an amateurish 1st year film school parody of noir mixed with a parody of Grand Guignol. The last thirty minutes of the film are literally spoken or read lines where most of the impossible-to-follow plot are ""revealed"" not through action, but by monologues. What is especially troubling is that the movie's pretense to be being based somehow on the horrific death of a young actress. While De Palma's film claims to be another expose of Hollywood's exploitation of young women which the ""Black Dahlia"" case represented, in fact it is De Palma himself here who is doing the exploiting. The ridiculous lesbian bar scene replete with what is now referred to as ""titty dancing"", the ""crawling on knees"" scene of what is supposed to be the actual ""Black Dahlia"" woman herself with De Palma himself providing the voice of the director who is exploiting her...none of these things ever happened except in De Palma's twisted imagination.

Stylistically, it looks good - being reminiscent of another Ellroy adaptation, 1997's fantastic ""L.A. Confidential"" directed by Curtis Hanson.

317,eirenightshade,What a Mess,4,3 April 2007,"This piece was highly disappointing; even for a fictional representation of a true Hollywood crime. I was excited to see this picture because I'm interested in the Black Dahlia case. Even as a fictional medium, I was sure Brian De Palma would have a surefire hit with this one, but it fizzled, and hard.Firstly, the set is sepia-toned and overdone. The campy 1940's noir look would have been effective if it had been a little less obvious. There was no point in watching this film where it felt like I wasn't just watching a bunch of actors on a set. With the exception of Miss Mia Kirshner who was phenomenal as Elizabeth Short, the acting was horrendous. Hilary Swank in particular was horrible as a promiscuous rich bitch with an annoying, haphazard fake accent. Another annoying thing is that everyone had a cigarette lit in every single scene as if to emphasize it was hip to be smoker back then. Something that was notable but overdone.Secondly, and most importantly, this wasn't a movie about Elizabeth Short. The Black Dahlia case seemed to be a more of a side-story than anything else as the film focuses around the two cops and their personal troubles. Any mention of Elizabeth Short seemed thrown in at the last minute and didn't make much sense. It might have been a decent movie if they'd left out the Elizabeth Short case altogether...at least then I wouldn't have had to sit patiently through the whole mess of bad dialogue waiting for them to blow the murder case wide open when it was clear that very little of the film actually had anything to do with its title character.If you are looking for a good murder mystery or are interested in the Black Dahlia case at all, you will be sorely disappointed by this movie. It's tacky, overdone, and badly acted. They should have either stuck to a film about Elizabeth Short's murder or excluded her altogether, because the end result was a mess. You're left confused and bewildered. Why, all the sudden at the very end, was Bucky disturbed by the vision of Betty Short's mutilated corpse? The entire film played down her role so much that the end wasn't effective and you wondered why Bucky was suddenly so disturbed about a case that was now closed and that the film had successfully played down to a mere side story.",The Black Dahlia

I thought to myself ""maybe it's just misunderstood to those unfamiliar with Ellroy's novel"" But frankly, it just never felt right,,, and then it went more and more uncomfortably wrong; the actors in their roles, the soundtrack vs. certain scenes, the story fumbling it's way around with not enough mention of The Dahlia herself (which really drove the characters in the novel). There were parts of the book that got left out which shouldn't have been, while there we're other parts 'put in' that could've been 'left out'. 'L.A. Confidential' was a longer and more complex book than Ellroy's 'The Black Dahlia', yet Curtis Hanson and Brian Helgeland knew what was necessary to move the story forward without getting in 'over their heads' in making it a functional screenplay. And that is where this movie fails miserably (along with the other fore-mentioned issues). It is however beautifully shot and lit in many scenes, but even a polished turd is still a turd, and that is essentially what you have here with DePalma's latest offering.

Sure, a longer version would have filled in some holes, but the way the film is constructed is just not terribly good. There is an elaborate setup involving the manufacture of a triangle consisting of the characters played by Josh Hartnett, Scarlett Johannson, and Aaron Eckhart. Right away, I was disenchanted. I thought the whole triangle was a total waste of time. There was no reason at all for the Scarlet Johannson character except to form one part of that unnecessary triangle. The point of the book was simple: Who killed Elizabeth Short? Why Brian DePalma thought he needed to make a whole other movie in order to establish and answer that question is beyond me.You have one simple job as a writer/director: tell a story. OK, make it noir, great, make it moody, fine. DePalma has always been a stylist and a good one, so we expect a highly-stylized film, but style needs to be used in the service of story and here it simply is not. The film is overwrought to say the least, plot threads seem to break off and end like the whole ""Nash"" episode. We are to assume it is all heading in the direction of finding out Who Killed Elizabeth Short, but in the end it is an exercise in movie-making for its own sake.Maybe DePalma thought he was doing another Chinatown, his Chinatown. Or The Big Sleep, his Big Sleep. But the movie just does not have the immediacy - nor the import - of Chinatown even though it is a film about a real, not an imagined, murder. And it doesn't, for all its deliberate contortions, have the complexities nor the sly humor of The Big Sleep. The murder of Elizabeth Short is reduced to a simple plot manipulation, a kink in a story instead of the story itself, the real obsession that it is supposed to represent. We are supposed to believe that Hartnett's character has become obsessed with Elizabeth Short, but there was no indication of that outside of the rather excessive dialogue between him and Hilary Swank in the motel room. The obsession belonged to Eckhart's character which was explained as having to do with his own sister's abduction and murder at fifteen, but Eckhart's character is too thinly spread to be the glue to hold this together.The murder investigation is reduced to Hartnett following up on the tortuous ""clues"" that he deduces from his conversation with the Linscotts. There is really little proper investigation at all. The movie just doesn't work because it doesn't tell the story it is supposed to tell and it doesn't follow the dramatic protocols that make this kind of story come to life. DePalma's attempt to deepen the connections between the characters and to explicate the themes of madness, pornography, money, and ultimately, love, takes us farther away rather than closer to the real story of the Dahlia. What we wanted was the Dahlia, what we got was DePalma in the sunset of his creative years. It's a pity, he could have really made something forceful, visceral, and good.Ellroy's book has a certain sick pornographic feel to it, and DePalma recognized that and wanted to bring that element forward, but he also knew that an actual story needed to be built around it because the book wasn't dramatically constructed at all. But the story DePalma cooks up is oddly removed from Ellroy's (and L.A.'s) own sick fantasies which would have been much better as the foundation for The Black Dahlia film than what DePalma ends up offering us. Instead of embracing the sordid mania of the killing itself he distances us from it by introducing too many other elements like sick rich people and overly-intricate plot mechanisms like characters who exist mostly off-screen and in the past. What is wrong with: There is the naked body of a young woman found cut in half and lying in a vacant lot? It is already creepy and fascinating, it reeks of sadism and sexual perversion. It has everything you need to make the thing work, yet it doesn't. As William Hurt's character in A History Of Violence says to one of his henchmen who has failed to complete a simple task of murder: ""How do you f*** that up?"" How indeed.",The Black Dahlia
321,ange_rankin,Too vague and reaching,2,17 September 2006,"While the concept and the basic plot of this movie were unique and interesting, the story line was vague and hard to follow. Half the time I had no idea who the characters were. Combine that with mumbled script and you get a confusing mess that the director had to solve with amateur techniques. Voice overs and flashbacks were needed to reveal the who, why and where of the murder. The movie would have been better if the story was told more clearly and allowed the audience itself to solve the case. This is one of those movies that I really wish it was done differently because the potential is there but product lacking.The movie was also long and at times slow. I wouldn't say this movie was a complete waste of time, but definitely a renter and not a theater. Save your money and wait for it's DVD release.",The Black Dahlia
322,LThomas72,Big Black Disappointment,3,19 September 2006,"'The Black Dahlia' has long been one of my favourite of Ellroy's novels, and man I love everything the Big Dog's ever written. I read it about ten years ago, knowing very little about him or his other novels, only that he wrote pure L.A noir and was well known for his unusual staccato style and misogynistic leading men. And, just like Lee Blanchard, I became helplessly obsessed with an icon.After 'L.A Confidential' was made, Curtis Hanson was touted as director for the 'Dahlia' for a year or so and my hopes for it soared. It's hard as hell to distill something as complex and stylish as Ellroy's writing into the medium of film, but somehow he'd managed it and with real flair and honesty. Ever character in 'L.A Confidential' was crucial to the plot - like playing cards in a perfectly balanced house of cards - and I marvelled at how Hanson had managed to pull of some perfectly nuanced and generous performances from such strong personalities as Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey and Guy Pearce. 'L.A Confidential' was like crack to me, like someone had just filmed my brain while I read the book and then transferred it to film, and I was in heaven.But then came the news that De Palma was directing 'The Dahlia' and suddenly I felt real fear. Don't get me wrong. I rate De Palma. 'The Untouchables' is a wonderfully stylish movie, as is 'Scarface', and 'Carlito's Way' ranks pretty highly with me as well, but just lately his offerings have kind of fallen short of the mark. I'm not sure that I'd label him 'a hack' but, in his last few movies at least, it's almost like you can smell the lack of imagination, the desperation to equal his past triumphs and to live up to that label they stuck on him during the 80s of 'The New Hitchcock'. And let's face it, 'Mission To Mars' wasn't exactly setting the screen alight.And then I saw the cast. Many years ago, I'd - impossibly - cast a much younger Gary Busey as Bucky Bleichert but, as time went on, I could see that was never going to become a reality. Although I considered Jake Busey for a while, I was never convinced he had the acting chops to pull it off, so I wasn't too disappointed to read that De Palma had cast Josh Hartnett in the role. OK, so he didn't look like Bucky, but he was solid and I was convinced he could pull it off. Scarlett Johansson as Kay Lake I could almost see. She had the right look, the right combination of sweetness and smarts maybe, and Aaron Eckhart as Lee Blanchard seemed like the best choice of the lot, although, weirdly, he looked far more like the book's description of Bucky than Hartnett ever could, but I let that one slide. Hilary Swank I didn't bat an eyelid at - she's a fantastic actress I said to myself - and Madeleine, although important, isn't part of the Big Three, so anything she does on screen is going to be alright by me.But, oh my god, how wrong can you be.You see, this is what 'L.A Confidential' did right. It recognised that the book is an ensemble piece, that each character is as important - in their own way - as another. Each performance relies on the integrity of the other to balance it and, if one is part of the whole is weak (Madeleine's accent is the most bizarre thing I'd ever heard - until I heard her father's) the whole thing starts to disintegrate before your eyes. Oh, and that's before you even start hammering all the individual nails in the Noir coffin.In short: I hated it. It came off like the worst kind of noir pastiche, like a totally self-conscious, self-important mess. It took all the simplicity and beauty of a pure noir crime novel and made it laughable. And there were people laughing. Believe me. And not when they should have been.True film noir is a state of mind that you can only achieve by carefully building the elements, by feeding the beast. You cannot force it. 'L.A Confidential' did it with passion and balls, 'Sin City' did it with style and humour and guts, but both achieved the genre - that perfectly pitched black tone - with seemingly effortless ease and a real, innate understanding of what noir truly is. And I'll give you a clue: it ain't filtered light through venetian blinds.I haven't said too much about the movie have I? Or the plot? The complete massacre of Ellroy's carefully constructed thread? The reduction of an icon - 'The Black Dahlia' herself - into some doe-eyed, ill-educated little slut that we are...what? Supposed to feel some kind of connection to? Supposed to understand? Did Josh Friedman only read the cliff-notes? 'The Black Dahlia' is about obsession, obsession with something no-one - not Lee, not Bucky, not Madeleine - truly knows or understands. The Dahlia as a person is unimportant. Who she was in life is less than irrelevant. It's what she means and what she comes to mean to each of them that is the key to the story: their obsession with a mystery that not one of them can ever solve, because the beautiful Elisabeth Short is dead and can no longer speak.Someone, somewhere missed the point. I'm only sorry they had to use my favourite novel to do it.",The Black Dahlia
323,jpmist,Film Noir Lite *small spoiler,4,16 September 2006,"I'm always happy when a director makes the effort to craft an homage to Film Noir, but in this case De Palma drifts too far from his own style to make a decent effort of it.Using James Ellroy's great pulp novel as a springboard, the film paints an often confusing story. The narrative seems to merely drift far past the half way point without much peril or suspense until the very end when we discover that almost nothing we've seen was without significance to it's final resolution.All that would have been tolerable were it not for the poor casting choices here. Josh Hartnett was badly miscast. A noir protagonist should have a dark gravitas about him that Hartnett appears too boyish to pull off. Scarlett Johansson didn't have much to do here but fill out a sweater. The film's best, Hilary Swank, was the only one in the cast who ""got"" the fact that she was in a film noir and shaded her performance perfectly for it.Still, the look of the film was wonderful and the luscious musical score tries hard to set the perfect noir tone. It's always fun to pick out the De Palma signatures; the paralyzed protagonist, the Hitchcockian Blond, the nightmare coda, etc. However in a true noir, the guy never gets the girl. . .",The Black Dahlia
324,ameh1,And Then There Was Caos,4,21 September 2006,"The movie begins promisingly enough, with the mournful lament of the solo horn, setting the mood and texture through the movements of the camera, editing, the design and color. One is transported back to Los Angeles in the late 1940's, with the decay and corruption lurking round every corner. Why then does one still feel cold and empty inside, why are we forced to watch the painful and laborious development of the relationship between Bucky, Kay, Lee. Why are we forced to watch Bucky and Kay interact with each other when they look uncomfortable and lack any chemistry. Why is their no clear explanation for Lee's complete break down. Why is Josh Hartnett allowed to express grief and emotion when he should be a somewhat wry observer to the enfolding of events, an outsider pulled into the story by the decay and corruption that surrounds him. The firs half of the movie is a complete and utter waste of money and talent, filled with characters that do not do justice to the mood that has been created, Scarlett Johansson seems young and inexperienced while the secondary nature of it all, makes the other actors look unconvincing.The movie truly begins when we are introduced to Madeleine and the Linscotts, but by then it is already too late, the mood is gone, as is the belief in the characters and story. Why wasn't Madeleine the focus from the first place, the movie should have been an exposition on the relationships between Madeleine, her family and the Dahlia. They should have explored the tragic and schizophrenic nature of this rich and decadent family, and the self destructive nature of their relationships. Why weren't Hilary Swank and Fiona Shaw allowed to dig deeper into their respective characters, instead we get to see disjointed pieces of what could have been great and brilliant performances and so we leave the theater somewhat put off and disheartened by the sudden bursts of energy and brilliance instead of a slow and steady exposure throughout the length and breadth of the film, thus making the actors look silly and foolish.Lost forever is the truly tragic nature of the Linscotts and their relationship to Elizabeth Short. Hilary Swank should always be the focus of any film, you need to have the complete hole, the mournful notes of the horn should begin and end with the face of Madeleine in mind, there is burning, like a volcano, within the depths of her Madeleine a tragedy waiting to happen, but we never get to see it explode, because of the erratic manner in which she is presented, her performance is disjointed with know connections, but one can see it in her eyes and face, burning beneath the surface, there are moments when one can envision the sense and sensibilities of some of the great actresses of a bygone era, a Mae West, a Kate Hepburn, or a Joan Crawford or a Marlene Dietrich. In the end we are completely embarrassed when she is instructed to say words like ""Stay Sugar Stay"" or the F word again and again, when it doesn't make sense at all, just an expression or a look would have been enough to say everything. Instead she is forced to play the counterpoint to Scarlett Johansson's Kay, a terrible mistake, for as Kay struggles to express her emotions, or to even utter a sentence, Madeleine has already gone over the top, down under and over the top again, to quote someone I am not sure who ( If I sound so Passionate, dear reader, so over over the top, like one of the Linscotts, you are correct, for I have become partially obsessed with her professional career, from the moment I witnessed her greatness in Boys Don't Cry, Million Dollar Baby and 11:14) I believe Josh Hartnett gives a solid performance, and it is not his fault when he is forced to show emotions when none should exist, but he seems completely out of place when asked to show passion or desire, no matter how hard Madeleine tries. It is difficult to judge Aaron Eckhart's performances, because the moment you get comfortable, he disappears. One walks away wanting know why is he so angry or upset. The second half seeks in vain to answer these burning question, but so much is cut from the film that it is one big mess. Making everything and everyone look unreasonable and nonsensical. Did the director decide to indulge in his own fantasies and delusions, or did he just throw up his hands in disgust and decide to make a mockery of it all. It could be that my imagination is working over time (as it often does every now and then), and that the actors who play the Linscotts including Hilary Swank were so bad that they were forced to edit out the important elements.Whoever was responsible for the script should be punished and never allowed to work in films again. Was it the intention of the director to compress within a two hour period two completely different movies, in the process destroying both, or was it his intention to humiliate the actors and expose the limitations of many modern day actors who believe that they are invincible and that they are good enough to embody all kinds of characters, or to criticize the studio executives who try to to make movies as if it is a box of cereal. It all seems completely irresponsible. At least an effort, though half hearted, is made to try and understand our eternal and deep obsession with ""making it"" in Hollywood.",The Black Dahlia
325,iamolc,A Lesson for Screenwriters,4,16 September 2006,"Josh Friedman forgot, or never knew, what Curtis Hansen understood when he prepared the script for LA Confidential. When adapting a novel by James Ellroy, a screenwriter must essentially start over. LA Confidential is a huge novel, worthwhile in its own right, but it bears only superficial resemblance to the excellent 1997 film. Hansen took certain plot elements, such as the Night Owl Massacre and the Victory Motel, and built a new story around them. Likewise, he eliminated several characters and combined others. The result was a film whose plot and characters were easy to follow and whose story was strong and compelling. For instance, the final shootout at the Victory Motel was no surprise, because we had already visited this scene of violence. The Black Dahlia would have benefited from similar treatment. The conclusion IS rushed, and too much is attempted in it. Folks started leaving not long after Lee's body went into the incinerator, and several more left after the second impossible scene at the foot of Hollywoodland. Most of us were just glad it was over, and some of us who have researched the Dahlia case were downright angry. James Ellroy's depiction of 1940's and 1950's Los Angeles flows from his childhood experience of the murder of his mother. It was never solved; so by extension, in Ellroy's world all LA cops are corrupt or incompetent or both. By extension, in Ellroy's world all murders result from convoluted and dark histories and motivations. In being adapted for the screen, Ellroy's work thus requires a strong filter. Curtis Hansen provided one. Josh Friedman did not. By the way, those interested in the historical aspects of the Dahlia case should consider the possibility that things pretty much were as they seemed, that Elizabeth Short was a young woman who came west in search of love and MAYBE a movie contract (there is absolutely NO evidence that she ever tested for any studio before her death). Rejected by her father (who was anything but a short-order cook), and usually broke, she took money from anyone who would give it to her, including men. She likely picked one man too many. Her death continues to be such a bonanza (and it'll pick up even more as January of 2007 nears) because it was never solved. The most likely reason is that her killer died fairly soon after the crime. There is one person who fits this scenario. Check out Larry Harnisch's website.",The Black Dahlia
326,horroregg,A huge let down,3,2 August 2007,"I was looking forward to this movie. If you haven't seen it yet and are expecting a dark, sultry, disturbing noir based the on this legendary unsolved murder, prepare to have your expectations crushed.To start with, it really only uses the title of the Black Dahlia case, not the story, it offers no possible hypothesis of the reasons for the murder, instead basing the story on total fictionalistion of the events surrounding the death of Elizabeth Short.The reasons why the writer (Leornard) and this, the subsequent film, use a real and horrific murder the basis for an entirely impossible story can only be commercial ones.Given a complete free hand, not constrained by facts, you'd imagine that such a talented team of writer and director would come up with a gripping movie. Unfiortunately what you get is a mess. The detectives are charmless and don't discover much, Scarlett Johanssen is there to look pretty alone as her character has no input to the story at all (she's fine, just pointless). People say and do things that seem significant, only for them never to come to anything. There's a mistaken identity part of the plot involving people who look absolutely nothing like each other and some insane over acting towards the end where the deranged plot is revealed. Don't expect to be able to work it out either, I defy anyone to guess the ending, and not because it's a clever twist but because it's so contrived and unbelievable. Look on the forums here and you'll see many people trying to work out the motivations of the characters by using the more detailed book. Not a good sign is it?As you'd expect, it looks fantastic, but it's a complete waste of time.",The Black Dahlia

A word to Mr. Hartnett, stop mumbling & learn to emote, other than that scene when you break down and cry, your facial expression never varies.

328,Villemar,Black Dahlia completely missed the emotional tone of the book,5,11 July 2007,"Well, James Ellroy is my favorite author. I've read the ""LA Quartet"" (Black Dahlia, Big Nowhere, LA Confidential and White Jazz) several times. Whereas Curtis Hansen completely nailed the emotional tone of LA Confidential without being 100% loyal to the story, Black Dahlia completely missed the emotional tone of the book, and made a failed attempt to be as loyal to the story as possible.*****Slight Spoilers Below***** The emotional tone of the book was OBSESSION. At first Lee Blanchard succumbs to it. In the book he's a very charismatic, extroverted, likable guy. Over time and with the assistance of benzadrine he slips into obsession and madness and it gets him killed.Bucky follows suit and he almost loses everything in his obsession with Short. As Bucky becomes more and more obsessed WE become more obsessed and we have this irrational hope the the killer will be found when we know in the back of our minds that Short's murder was unsolved.The film omits much of Bucky's quest. The letters from the killer. The frame up of the vagrants. The sick son cop who was with Short before she was last seen at the Biltmore. The degenerate dentist/abortionist. Although, many of these other missing scenes were not essential to the cinematic experience (ie. Red Manly, the trip to Massachusetts).The casting was completely off with the exception of Mia Kirchner (and to a lesser extent the guy who played Emmett Linscott). Josh Hartnett is a good actor but just doesn't have enough range to show us Bucky's descent into obsession (although to be fair the bad script doesn't really let him). Scarlett Johansen just doesn't fit here. In the book Kay is more of an independent tomboy, not a glamour girl. Hillary Swank was all wrong. Aaron Eckhart COULD have worked here but the script didn't allow him to show off his potential.Another thing that was totally random and disappointing was the casting of Mike Starr as Russ Millard. Russ Millard is fairly unique in the Ellroy canon because he is probably the only character in his books that is genuinely a good man with *no* dark past or dark underbelly. He is supposed to be Bucky's mentor and father-figure, but in the movie he is just a 2-dimensional character with no personality.Another minor scene that was wasted was the autopsy scene. In the book you really get a sense of the horror of the killing from the autopsy. In the movie it's just some weird obese guy flatly throwing out a few lines.The screen test shots were excellent although DePalma's voice took me out of those scenes a little (not knowing it was him when I saw the movie).To sum up. The meta-theme in all of Ellroy's books is the dark, dark underbelly of LA in the 40's and '50's. People think of LA back then as this happy, glamorous, romantic Hollywood, a Golden Age. Ellroy exposes the dark, sick underbelly beneath the surface. DePalma seems to have missed this.One thing I most sincerely hope is that those who hated this movie will not avoid Ellroy now because of this cinematic debacle. He is America's best living noir writer. It's too bad Fincher was unable to make this movie, he would have done it a thousand times better.",The Black Dahlia
329,songofvictory2011,an incomprehensible mess,4,5 May 2013,"Having read the book, I can say this is a pretty terrible adaptation. This movie is another film that tried to ride the wave of Sin City's success even using Josh Hartnett as the lead (he had a bit role in Sin City) I'll be honest the book is convoluted like most of Ellroy's fiction and one almost needs some kind of character chart to follow the action properly. That being said, the screenwriters compressed the story and completely rewrote whole portions of the plot. Back to Harnett. He's not right for this role and I guess not right for the vast majority of roles. i've seen this handsome yet bland fellow in so many clunkers, I've pretty much written him off. Scarlett Johanson is only slightly better. HIllary Swank as the femme fetal is useless. Aaron eckhart tries very hard to play his part well and is the only glimmer of hope in the film. You can seen his inner turmoil and symptoms of PTSD. The supporting cast is serviceable but lost in the mess. De Palma and the studio was clearly trying to capitalize on the success of earlier films like there's some kind of complicated formula punched into a machine that will spit out box office gold. Frankly, I don't think Ellroy's books have ever been adapted into great movies. LA Confidendial is a good film but not a great film. Overall, if you've read the book rent the film and have a good chuckle at how wrong they got the whole thing.",The Black Dahlia

The film threw so much pointless junk at you, that it was hard to follow the movie. The film is supposed to be about the death of Elizebeth Shore. Unfortunately, they actually focus very little on that topic.There are about 100 other things happening during the film, and 99 of them are irrelevant. I mean, the writing is terrible. This is another one of those films where third party, completely random characters become the culprits, and defeat the purpose of getting to know the main characters in the first place.The positive things that I can say is that they do sort of tie some things together at the end (although the results will only serve to tick most people off).

I thought this would be De Palma's return to great form. I was wrong. This is not the terrible film that many people are saying it is. However, its not that good a film either. Watching Black Dahlia is frustrating because everything required for a great movie is there, but it never comes together. De Palma's cinematic prowess is in fine noir form as his love of long takes sweeping camera angles, and rapid editing serves the film well. The production is lush and great looking. I understand the thinking behind casting Scarlett Johansson and Josh Hartnett, but they really don't work. And as for Hilary Swank, God that woman is overrated and completely miscast here. The underlying problem here is the script. While I haven't read Ellroy's novel i suspect that this adaptation is far more disjointed than the novel. The plots and subplots fail to connect together at any stage, and most importantly, the Dahlia murder.....what i believed to be the core of the movie almost plays second fiddle to a weak love triangle. I had anticipated this film so very much, and while this film is far from the trash that many are describing it as...devoted De Palma fans will have to continue to wait for his next classic.",The Black Dahlia

The book centers more around the love triangle that evolves between, Blanchard, Bleichert and Kay Lake. The fault that occurs while following the book so closely is that a movie going audience could not appreciate the character development and sub-plots the same way Ellroy does in the novel. The movie is filmed perfectly as you get that noir feeling while watching it. Personally, I thought the character selection was average. Hartnett looks like Bucky Bleichert. Eckart is good at playing Lee Blanchard and Mia Kirshner plays Elizabeth Short well. Scarlett way be hot, but her job of portraying Kay Lake is not that good.

338,lvburns,Black Dahlia Reflection of Some Classics,7,21 September 2006,"On the surface, De Palma's The Black Dahlia might seem to be a stylish but convoluted mess. The plot certainly does not have a linear flow to it. The director certainly sets the mood and the feel of film noir with its characterizations and techniques and gets these right for the most part. Dig a little deeper and you will find that the director pays homage to some classics.Held up to a mirror, The Black Dahlia is very reminiscent of The Big Sleep - the wealthy father and his two daughters of society, one of whom is involved in the worlds of gambling and pornography; the murders; the blackmail and corruption; the characters who pop up either on screen or just in dialogue among other characters. And if I remember correctly, in one scene between Bogey and Bacall, Marlowe even mentions to her that at one time he was a boxer. The plot twists and turns in The Black Dahlia are just as convoluted as the ones in this classic.Dig deeper still and you will see that the director pays his respects to another classic. When Bucky lights two cigarettes at once and hands one to Madeleine, the action is a clear reference to Now Voyager, in which Paul Henreid's character does the same for Bette Davis's. Supposedly that was the first time it was ever done on screen.I am sure there are more references to classic movies, whether in specific actions by the actors or in overall themes and characterizations. The Black Dahlia might not look like a classic. Over time that may change. One could argue that, held up in the light of those movies from the '30's, '40's and '50's, it is certainly not completely original. It is a contemporary reflection of what has already been done before. And all in all, not a bad effort from De Palma.",The Black Dahlia
339,TeresofBlood,Better than expected... if you like Film Noir,8,23 September 2006,"The film turned out to be much better than I expected. In terms of style and storytelling, it felt, from beginning to end, like an authentic Film Noir. The cinematography was amazing, with a lot of Deep Focus shots, it really adds so much to the ambiance of the film. Visually, the film is amazing.In terms of the plot, the first half hour feels unnecessary and overly visual, but after that, you lose yourself in the compelling plot. It feels very much like a novel, in that novels are often filled with events that add little to the film. For instance, the film opens with a riot scene between zoot-suits and service men. This event adds nothing to the plot, but it's one of those nuances the writer of the novel included to entrench us in his world. In the world of film, every event has to add something to the plot, because films can never be as long as the novels that inspire them. The plot is very dramatic. Those expecting to see a thriller will be disappointed, but those looking for an excellent Film Noir, will enjoy it.In terms of casting, I think the film accomplishes its goals very well. Hartnett in the lead does quite well. He is enjoyable to watch throughout, though there are a few moments that could've used a little more emotion, but then again, Film Noirs are always filled with stoic characters. Aaron Eckhart was great as the passionate, but flawed cop. There is little to complain about in his performance. Johansson was perfect in her role. Like her role in ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" her personality is right out of the time period. She has such an old-fashioned look to her, and it works for her in this film. She would not be better served playing one of the film's seductresses, as I think people were expecting. I feel that Hilary Swank overacted at times, but in the end, she provoked the desired audience reaction beautifully.The music on the film perfect for the type of film. From beginning to end, it feels like the perfect Film Noir score. Dare I say, it is reminiscent of Chinatown at times. It is very authentic and adds an entire dimension to the film.My only real problem with the film is the ending. There is so much going on that the film attempts (and fails) to wrap everything up into a neat little box. This is the only time I found myself going, ""what the hell just happened?"" It doesn't kill the movie for me, because I see it as this film's way of staying with you after it ends.All in all, if you were expecting an edgy thriller, this film is not for you. But if you're looking for a great Film Noir with many great dimensions and aspects, great acting, and great writing, this is the film for you.One final thought to James Ellroy fans; this film is not as good as LA Confidential, but great in it's own right.",The Black Dahlia
340,firepants49343,"Holy crap, this sucks.",1,24 June 2007,"I can remember seeing the previews when this came out and being mildly interested because it was an unsolved true-crime. I didn't see it in the theater, and frankly I'm glad. I would have walked out.First of all, get the DVD, if you insist on watching this. You'll need to put on the closed captioning to be able to understand some of the dialog. The actors get so mumble-mouthed and their words so caught up in the parlance of the time period that I kept expecting some cheesy 1930s gangster to jump out with a tommy-gun and yell ""Rocky's really mad now, see? Yeah, yeah! Its curtains for you mugs! Yeah, Yeah!"" Then, I was ready for a murder mystery. I figured we'd get a little set-up on the cops that are going to be investigating the crime and then jump right in to the murder. Well, the first twenty minutes of a true-crime drama are really a boxing movie. Its supposed to establish the two cops' relationship, but frankly, who cares? Then we have Scarlett Johansen, the wife of the one cop, a character that wasn't needed at all. Add to that Aaron Eckhart's character going from a balanced, cocky, albeit capable cop to someone who flies into a tantrum and breaks dishes because his wife put his dinner on the table, covering a black and white photo he happened to be talking to. Josh Hartnett's voice overs sound like something out of Mickey Spillane. Hillary Swank appears in another confusing and pointless subplot including a dinner scene with her family, straight out of ""House of a 1000 Corpses"". Frankly, I don't even know who did it, nor do I care. I threw it back in the mail for Netflix to rent out to the next sucker.",The Black Dahlia
341,The_Moose,"Stylish, but trite",6,17 September 2006,"The Black Dahlia -- three stars The Black Dahlia is the latest film from director Brian DePalma (""The Untouchables""). Unfortunately, it's also the latest film by screenwriter Josh Friedman (""War Of The Worlds""), who couldn't adapt a great story if it was dropped into his lapwhich it was.The Black Dahlia is a great example of how you can have almost all of the elements of a great film -- the cinematography, acting, slick plot, etc -- and still fail to make a great movie. Why? The film lacks a simple, key element to the noir/neo-noir construct: the mystery. The movie moves along as though it's building up to some big, lurking mystery behind Tinsel town (think ""Blue Velvet""), only there isn't. Well, not really. In the last 30 minutes, the whodunit portion of the film rears its head like a stick of lubricious gum; a burst of 40's flavor. The mystery comes and goes in a flash. He has a realization, starts to ""properly"" investigate the murder of Elizabeth Short, and before you even realize that any of this is happening, the murder is revealed. The killer's identity nothing shocking, fancy or jaw dropping; just like the movie. It's silly and pointless, more or less. So on and so forth, the movie rolls on in a slick, enrapturing style that just never amounts to anything. It's quite disappointing.""L.A. Confidential"" set a bar for James Elroy movies that ""The Black Dahlia"" fails to clear. We know he has the talent, so who is to blame? I place it squarely on Friedman. ""War Of The Worlds"" was the worst film of 2005 and it reflects here; maybe if ""The Black Dahlia"" was played off as a summer release teen-noir instead of the first ""serious"" good film of the year, then maybe my interpretation of the quality of this film may have been different. However, it wasn't and it isn't.But let's cut the crap. The movie is amusing at many points and Hilary Swank is surprisingly not annoying. However, these fun, catchy scenes are trumped by longer, more trite scenes that make you wish you'd gone to see something else. The 2 hour runtime is way too long (it feels like 3) and the last scene has one of DePalma's stupid trademark endings with the random, pointless re-appearance of the Elizabeth Short's mutilated corpse on Harnett's lawn, set to loud, piercing ""music."" Why, I ask.Oh yeahI almost forgot to mention the plot: It's about two 1940s L.A. cops (Josh Hartnett and Aaron Eckhart) who head up the hunt for the killer of aspiring ""starlet"" Elizabeth Short. That's about as complex as the movie gets. If you're looking for a good neo-noir, don't waste your time. Rent ""L.A. Confidential,"" ""Chinatown,"" and ""Blue Velvet"" instead.",The Black Dahlia
342,Bradford,A film that cries out for a director's cut.,6,18 September 2006,"This film is merely okay. It's not nearly as satisfying as another Elroy adaptation, L.A. Confidential. The period look of De Palma's film, while not bad, didn't strike me as solidly as the earlier film, or even as De Palma's own The Untouchables. I thought Fiona Shaw's performance to be shamelessly over-the-top so that it was merely a hollow, ludicrous caricature. As far as the criticism that it's confusing, or that the ending is tacked on, I think that's because of the breakneck pacing. As at least one previous poster has noted, it's all there--you just need to pay attention. That's why I think this film might benefit from a longer cut with less frenetic pacing. And maybe digitally replace Fiona Shaw. Still, I'm not sorry that I saw it, which is about all the enthusiasm I can work up for this movie.",The Black Dahlia

From the first minutes you notice, that it's a movie based on a novel- story. Confusedly but intelligent, sensitive but tough. Somewhat strange story, De Palma had chosen for his new project.I like it, though after it, you might have the feeling, that you're too dumb to understand. And the moral of the movie is ""Everybody is kind of crazy in this world"", I guess.By the way: Excellent actors - they all play their roles very well. Every character has something to hide (like in a book - you know, what I mean). You even feel it in this movie. It's pretensions are on a high level. We had luck, the movie's made in Technicolor ;)Patrick ""interunic""",The Black Dahlia
344,tj1screen,Cinematography Soars while Storyline Suffers,6,6 September 2006,"Brian DePalma's new film THE BLACK DAHLIA is cinematically gorgeous and carries us deep into film noir territory . . . from the gritty streets to its bluesy musical track to the crisp Elmore Leonard dialogue. The sets and wardrobes are straight out of the 1940s, and we instantly feel we're in the hands of a master.However, the storyline is obtuse and leaves the viewer floundering for far too long to remain emotionally invested in these characters. The film ends with a flurry of explanations and activity which are supposed to tie up lose ends and provide reasonable explanations for what ensued; however, my viewing companions and I were past caring and became more interested in just exiting the theater. The film starts with an involved boxing match which serves to provide explanation as to how these two cops started working together - which must be why we're shown each bone-cracking, kidney-pounding punch - mostly in slow motion. There's nothing that says ""Let's be friends"" like punching the incisors out of someone's head.Every film noir needs its femme-fatale, and she's provided here by Scarlett Johanssen. I respect this actress, but was disappointed in her in SCOOP, with her faux damsel-in-distress face in close-up . . . which is used a lot in BLACK DAHLIA to equal ineffectiveness. There was so much potential in her earlier work which promised more depth from Scarlett.Which actor shines here? By far, it's Aaron Eckhardt. His performance - and Hilary Swank's - pop out from the screen. Mia Kirschner is very palpable as the unfortunate, hapless Elizabeth Short. And Fiona Shaw is undeniably fascinating as the unbalanced entitled heiress. Josh Hartnett does a competent journeyman job as co-star. But in the end, it's the story which torpedoes our empathies - not the casting, which some reviews want to rest the blame. The film could easily forgo the 15-minute boxing scene to concentrate upon the complex storyline for a more satisfying film - and a more satisfied audience.",The Black Dahlia
345,mnladydiana,Very Good,8,13 October 2006,"I liked this movie very much. It's film noir genre was an added bonus. Admittedly, anyone going to see this movie counting on it focusing on the grotesque murder/mutilation of Elizabeth Short might feel short-changed (no pun intended), but it's still very much worth watching. The movie is about two Los Angeles cops in the 1940's, and Elizabeth Short's murder is just one of the cases they deal with; it not only has a 1940's look, but also the ""feel"" of the past. Josh Harnet's performance is outstanding, as well as that of the other cast members. This film is not predictable, it moves. I walked in the theatre expecting a two hour speculation of an unsolved crime. I was pleasantly surprised.",The Black Dahlia
346,nunu1345,Trash,1,4 December 2006,"There is no way around it, so I will just say this straight. This movie was pure garbage. It wasn't like I wasn't warned, but critics tend to bash all the movies that I have come to love, so when I heard the reviews I did not listen. Lord I should have, there were so many better movies out. I couldn't blame one singular person for this debacle, it was a team effort. I would love to go further an pin-point all the plot holes, and poorly executed scenes but I'd be here all night. So I will reiterate, this film was GAR-BAGE. I am a fan of bad film, but this was so bad that it didn't make me laugh, I made me mad that I wasted movie I could have spent of a two DVDs from the $5.50 bin at Wal-mart. If I had gone with my gut instinct, and done so I probably would have found something better to watch. When a movie has a star-studded line-up I at least expect the movie to be half-way decent.

The movie would be a lot less complication without me trying to figure out for half the movie which on is Mr. Fire and which one is Mr. Ice? Thank God I only rented the DVD instead of seeing it in theaters. I would have had to be kicked out of the theater. I spent a good 20 minutes off and on pausing the DVD to ask, ""What exactly is going on here?"" The movie was far too complicated and spent too much time trying to tie up all the characters in a shocking conclusion that *gasp* isn't too shocking. The ending was fairly simply, but spent a good hour and a half going the long way around to find that conclusion. When the solution was finally found, I didn't really care anymore who killed the girl. Not even the quick view of Josh Harnett's butt could have saved this movie (but thanks for adding it in!).",The Black Dahlia
348,hawaiianshirt79,"Tedious, baffling and overly long",2,4 October 2006,"Early on in the story of Brian DePalma's latest film, I began to wonder if I had suffered some sort of brain injury that was impairing my cognitive functions.Despite having definitely been present for the start of the film, credits and all, I had the distinct feeling that I'd walked in half way through a movie that was already in progress.I checked to make sure I hadn't had some sort of stroke and missed half an hour, and, surprisingly, I hadn't missed anything. The film really is that cluttered, that fractious, and that under-written.It's hard to begin to dissect just exactly what went wrong with The Black Dahlia, because I'm not sure anyone in the theatre could actually tell you what the hell was supposed to be going on.Opening with Josh Hartnett as a cop about to enter a boxing match, we flick through the next few months of his life, in which he is partnered with his boxing opponent (Aaron Eckhart) and meets said partner's attractive wife (Scarlett Johansson, showing up almost at random and gamely conveying whichever emotion the scene apparently calls for, whatever the reason) and after a while, the murder of the titular character occurs.It's interesting to note that the discovery of the body occurs in the background of an unrelated scene, because that's pretty much how the Black Dahlia murder remains throughout the film. It's little more than an occasionally mentioned backdrop. It features about as heavily in this film as rocks do in Lord of the Rings. Quite often forming part of the backdrop, but barely noticed or mentioned by anyone on screen.If, like me, you assumed that once we got into the case that the movie is named after, a narrative would emerge, you're in for a tedious and confusing disappointment.With Josh Hartnett's partner becoming instantly obsessed with the Dahlia case, for reasons which won't be revealed until three quarters of the way through the film, and then will never crop up again anyway, Hartnett blunders around for a bit, investigates the Dahlia's possible lesbianism, falls for a bisexual femme fatale (a woefully miscast Hillary Swank) who, we're told, looks exactly like the dead girl.This does rather ignore the fact that Hilary Swank looks - and I'm being generous here - ABSOLUTELY NOTHING LIKE THE DEAD GIRL.Then there's Swank's insane family, the criminal who is coming out of jail to seek revenge on Eckhart, and numerous other plot strands that crash jarringly into each other. It feels like four different films were in some sort of horrific car accident and became mangled and entwined with each other so hopelessly that it was eventually decided that the only hope was to release the whole sorry mess and stick a ridiculously neat ending on it.Speaking of which, to save you the admission money: Hillary Swank dunnit. And so did her mum.This revelation, incidentally, comes at a denouement so bafflingly random and contrite that it could actually have been made slightly more plausible if the Lone Ranger and Tonto had showed up in a spaceship to deliver the crucial evidence in the Ark of the Covenant.In a similarly surprising vein, lesbian singer kd lang pops up, stretching her acting ability to the absolute limit by playing a lesbian singer with no dialogue. Nothing about the film works. Josh Hartnett was the worst thing about Sin City, opening that film by giving sullen, flat voice-over to an unrelated moment in the story. Sadly, Brian DePalma obviously thought that what the world needed was an entire film of Josh Hartnett giving sullen, unconvincingly naff voice-over to scenes that were nothing to do with anything else. His dialogue would be cringe worthy if delivered by someone who had a genuine noir presence, but given to the youthful, pretty and charisma-free Hartnett, the whole thing is just embarrassing.Scarlett Johansson, meanwhile, feels like a hindrance to what little story there is. You can't escape the impression that they hired her, and then didn't know what to do with her, so just put her into the story at arbitrary moments when things needed to look a little prettier. Hillary Swank, despite being a gifted actress, is resolutely not a smouldering temptress. We all knew that, so surely the best performance that can even be tangentially connected to this film is that of Swank's agent when she convinced someone that her client was right for the part. In the end, the only big winners seem to be the tobacco industry. Smoking in film noir may be expected, but here it's taken to almost cartoonish levels. Regardless of activity, be it driving, sleeping, scuba diving, bungee jumping or space travel, one or more characters will be smoking whilst they do it. It's uncanny. It wouldn't jarr so much if any of the cast seemed comfortable doing it, but all stars concerned reek so heavily of Los Angeles personal trainers and gym-rat protein shakes that seeing them smoke is akin to watching Kermit the Frog try to negotiate a heroin sale. Even Johansson, who is genuinely sexy and a smoker, feels hopelessly lost in dowdy period clothes and encumbered by a ridiculously out of place cigarette holder, which, at least in the early scenes, appears to be glued to her fingers.It's hard to sum this film up, because, as I say, it's hard to tell exactly what the point, or even the plot, really is. Suffice to say that in thirty years, when Josh Hartnett's career is looked back on and a montage of random clips from all of his films is played, it will make exactly as much sense as The Black Dahlia does. Although it will probably be a little more interesting.",The Black Dahlia
349,dsparks555,Big Let Down,6,23 September 2006,"The Black Dahlia was a film I really wanted to like. I had enjoyed most of Brian De Palma previous work and I had read a few books about the horrific murder that inspired the film. And there is a lot to like about the film. The film the right look and feel for Los Angeles in the 1940s, the cinematography is brilliant with a very subtle and stylized look, and the actors all in turn in fine performances. The only think the film lacks is a coherent and believable storyline. The Black Dahlia is one of those films where you don't realize how thin the storyline is until the big ""pay off"" at the end. And trust me on this the ""pay off"" in this film wouldn't buy you a cup of coffee. Without giving anything away let me just say that this outlandish mess looks as if the screen writer and director all of sudden realized that they didn't have a real ending, so they threw in as many unexplained and contrived plot twists as they could in order tie everything up in a neat package. So one should have told them that when you have shocking revelations at the end of your story, it helps if the audience can make some sort of connection to something that happened earlier in the film...I don't know...that would be called ""linkage"" maybe.

The film is a mystery/suspense/thriller which centers around The Black Dahlia case and two competitive LAPD detectives that investigate it. As usual DePalma's riveting filmwork adds tremendous style to what would've been an ordinary mystery. While the plot seems to drift at times, in the end you see everything has to do with the dahlia. Josh Hartnett and Scarlett Johansson always look great in front of the camera, especially Johnasson who would've succeeded among the likes of Rita Hayworth or Ava Gardner had SHE been around back in the day. Noticed little tidbits from ""Chinatown"", ""The Untouchables"" and such, but they were great movies too so who cares? It's unfortunate that film noir such as this and ""Hollywoodland"" rarely succeed at the box office. I doubt this will garner much Oscar buzz, but there's always hope for the underdog!

It involves violence, money, pimps, porn, and ""the most notorious murder in California history"". Sadly though, the movie just doesn't cut it.The Black Dahlia isn't about murder, or guns, or pimps or porn. The Black Dahlia is about the new American dream: to sleep with Scarlett Johansson. The Dahlia isn't even introduced until a third of the movie is over, the longest 45 minutes I've ever experienced in cinema. A good hour of the movie doesn't have anything to do with the plot, and watching it is just like watching paint dry. Much of this wasted screen time is attributed to the relationship between Sgt. Leland ""Lee"" Blanchard (Aaron Eckert) and Officer. Dwight ""Bucky"" Bleichert (Josh Hartnett), where we see their transformation from enemies to partners to friends unrealistically fast, which is unrealistically cliché.But the biggest downside of the movie is Josh Hartnett. What Hartnett is doing as a serious actor is beyond me, but his performance is a wooden as they come. It is unbelievable that he was considered for the role of Bleichert, and the fact that he was cast really makes me lose faith in Hollywood's mainstream actors. His noir-ish voice-over was like reading words off the script, making it feel less and less like the artsy film De Palma intended it to be.The only redeeming feature of the flick was Mia Kirshner who had about one minute of screen time as the Dahlia, but was the most memorable character. Oh, yeah, and we do get to see Hilary Swank's ass.But overall, The Black Dahlia is just another bad film to cap off the summer. It is extremely confusing with all its pointless sub-plots, and just gets annoying at the end. It's one of those movies you consider walking out of, and I counted down the minutes to what I thought would be a climactic finale, but was just a series of long monologues and unclear speaking. In the end, we learned little about the Dahlia, and were pretty much back where we started, except for a few missing comrades.",The Black Dahlia
359,barkmuffin,Lovely to look at...,5,21 September 2006,"This film is all set design and great looking people in beautifully realized forties styles. You almost wish you could go back and buy yourself a fedora and just jump in. There are enough zany subplots and stories going around about this film to make it become a sort of backdoor ""classic"", like ""Showgirls""...but...it's not quite that. I mean, it's really not ""so bad it's good"". It's more like ""How can you spend this much money and make something which is so fantastic to look at and not have a plot?"" With any kind of meaningful story line, this film could have been a contendah. It could have been somebody. Nonetheless, if you love the movies, don't miss it! How many times can you rate a film as a 5 out of 10 and still say it's a ""don't miss""? Is Hilary Swank channeling Katherine Hepburn? Is Rose McGowan channeling Mae West? You know, there is a chance they did know what they were doing--directed to act in over the top forties noir modes--in which case, this really is a work of art and the joke is on us. Good one!",The Black Dahlia
360,pdavideastburn,Who was the real victim?!,4,12 September 2006,"I felt very disappointed after seeing this movie as my expectations were high that I would finally see a cogent depiction of the Black Dahlia's death, and supposedly why and where she was killed. The Black Dahlia might as well have been left out of this movie altogether. It's really her name and the notoriety of this infamous unsolved case (like Jack the Ripper) that is the hook to lure you into this ""film noir"". The only thing dark is the humor--like a stuffed dog holding the newspaper that announced the impending riches of his owner, (who shot him to 'preserve' the moment)! Or lines like, ""You would rather F** me, then kill me"". Even the stereotyped California indifference to an earthquake is laughable. This movie really wasn't about Elizabeth Short/Black Dahlia or the crime. The trailer shown on t.v. has a scene indicating that her body was drained in a bathroom. But this scene was not in the movie! If you want great set direction, period ambiance, outstanding moody music, and the look of post WWII Los Angeles in the 40's, then this will suffice to make a good movie for you. I did enjoy DePalma's direction especially his aerial view of the field across the street from where the body was found, and the horrified woman screaming to find help in the maelstrom of action going on in the other parts of the screen. DePalma's dark settings are legendary. Of the lead characters, Josh Harnett (Ofcr. Dwight ""Bucky"" Bleichert), Aaron Eckhart (Sgt. Leland ""Lee"" Blanchard), and Hilary Swank (Madeleine Linscott) stood out. Scarlett Johansson (Kay Lake) was only memorable for always holding her cigarette holder askew. (Yes, cigarette smoking was ubiquitous in the '40's, but do we have to have a cigarette clouding up each and every scene that a main character is in? I felt like there was no such thing as a non-smoker in my parent's days.) Fiona Shaw (Ramona Linscott, mother to Swank's character), stole the whole movie with her over-the-top 'Norma Desmond'/ZaSu Pitts-like camp portrayal. I started a small round of applause in the theater after her opening scene at dinner, and a few appreciative fans joined in. Who were all those minor characters introduced, and what was their purpose? Hard if not impossible to follow. I found myself asking my friend what was going on, what did I just see/hear, as the scene moved on without clarity. But he couldn't answer me either. Bad editing, or just bad writing/scripting? Just when you thought loose ends of the story would be tied up, you were stymied again by the lack of continuity. I don't know if the screenwriter, Josh Friedman, had much to work with in James Ellory's book. I leafed through it and decided I didn't like his style of writing, although I did enjoy his documentary ""Feast of Death"" (2001) where he plays himself discussing his mother's murder, and the Black Dahlia case; and of course, ""L.A. Confidential"" (1997) adapted from his novel. This movie felt like ""Son of L.A. Confidential"". After enduring the long lead-in establishing the connection between Harnett's and Ekhart's characters, I thought the scene of the two bloody front teeth knocked out at ringside was an omen of things to unfold--the introduction of blood from violence--thus the grisly murder of the Black Dahlia. So I patiently waited for the payoff, that unfortunately never materialized. I felt like I was watching clips from the movie ""8 mm"" with the ""screen test"" of Elizabeth Short (and the film voice over by DePalma). Strange voyeuristic ploy. The only time she is depicted is in old B/W films. Her life was never recreated outside her 'captured' life on film. But I guess that was a gimmick also to only portray her in black and white--no luscious red lips as depicted in the posters. If that is the case, why didn't Universal revert back to its black and white film opening logo with the old propeller plane circling the world? I kept being distracted by the run in the Dahlia's hose, that was so evident in the old uncovered film of her, in effect saying that she had a pathetic lot in life. She even picked at the threads in the runs of her hose while she winced and talked to her interrogator (DePalma)! The implication was: ""Poor little, naive girl, we should pity her""! The Black Dahlia who was always depicted in history as ravishingly beautiful, stylish, and outgoing was never given the courtesy of being depicted as a real person. None of the main (historical) suspects in her murder were even mentioned, considering the two main characters were cops investigating her death! The scene with the quick telescoping-in effect of the camera on the severed body as seen in a flash back by ""Bucky"" Bleichert (Josh Harnett) outside Kay Lake's (Scarlett Johnasson) house was reminiscent of the shocking finding of the mother's body in the cellar in ""Psycho"". But remember, it was Universal Studios in both instances, cashing in on their copyrighted material--cheap inside trick, but most clever. And just when you think things will congeal and make sense, the movie ends abruptly. You are left as cold as the unsolved case. Where is Sumner Redstone when you need him? Universal should confer with Viacom! I usually stay to view the credits out of respect for the Industry, but I was like the rest of the lemmings rushing to get out of the theater. This movie will make it's money in the opening 2 weeks, but word of mouth should sink its intended profits. I was so disappointed as I felt like a victim of the hype of this movie. As I say, always beware of movies that are advertised on t.v. So many victims of this movie. But the real victim is still Elizabeth Short, yet once again!!",The Black Dahlia

However, I am, for the moment at least, stunned into complete inability to recall even one.Brian Di Palma is such a terribly, terribly feeble imitation of Alfred Hitchcock. Di Palma films are, in general, pretty bad, but he has outdone himself this time around! I think he had to be really trying to make a bad movie, to make one quite this awful. It is disjointed, fanciful, silly, incoherent and insipid. Just as a crowning touch, the attempt to re-create the late 40s period was done on the cheap and was consistently unconvincing.The acting was universally atrocious. Others commenting have criticized Scarlett Johansson's and Hilary Swank's acting in other films. Not me. I think they're both quite decent actresses -- but not in this turkey! I want my money back!

At the end, we all sat in silence, unable to believe how bad it had been. Really, really bad. Without redeeming qualities.Novocaine directing of a terrible plot. Merit-less performances by pretty and untalented people - Josh Hartnett and Scarlett Johansson were the worst. I was hoping that Hilary Swank would do better, but she didn't.

If the genre says thriller, mystery it should be thrilling and mysterious not dull and confusing.The central characters are also very superficial and it looks like they came to promote their hair rather than tell a story.In conclusion my advice to you is to skip this title.

The progression of the plot was painfully slow and rather disjointed at times. There was laughter in the movie theatre at parts that were meant to be dramatic. I had no vested interest in any of the characters and didn't care what was happening to them nor when they died. This movie is not murder mystery as i expected it to be.

365,LadySylvester,"dah-ling entertainment, but flawed.",7,2 June 2011,"""The Black Dahlia""... was a masterfully filmed, impeccably scored version of an already-flawed novel. James Ellroy's rambling noir-detective story was hard to put down. I just finished it today, and as a casual Dahlia-phile, I was impressed by his attention to detail and his gripping way of tying real life with fiction in a way that no reader forgets. The film version brightened some bits that I didn't like about the book: Lee Blanchard (in a lovely turn by Aaron Eckhart) is much more fleshed out, for one. (One scene in particular, after Kay chucks the Dahlia's entire case file down the porch stairs and leaves Blanchard to scramble for the papers, broke my heart. Eckhart was perfectly pathetic as the tortured detective.) And one angle that De Palma added was significantly missing from the book... a glimpse of the Dahlia, Elizabeth Short, while she was alive. Her ""screen tests,"" played to sad perfection by Mia Kirshner, offer an innocent side to the victim. Ellroy's novel paints the Dahlia as a starry- eyed, lying tramp who opened her legs for a nickel. All we hear of her is what Bucky pieces together from all the men she entertained and the girls she tricked with. Glimpses of Betty Short in her attempts to audition, and her pained face during a stag film, were real highlights of the movie. Now for the bad stuff: De Palma's ""Dahlia"" is a grossly over-simplified version of the novel. DO NOT watch this movie without reading the book first; no crack goes unfilled in the book. A faithful film adaptation would've lasted six hours, but every niche would've been explained. Every mention of Mexico is omitted (Tijuana is originally where the Lorna/Betty stag film was supposedly shot, and where Lee Blanchard is murdered], but in the interest of time, the locales shrunk and the time frame was squeezed from two years into a couple of months.) Speaking of the killing of Lee Blanchard, that scene had to be the most contrived, unwatchable piece of garbage I've seen since ""Rocket Science"". Apropos of nothing, out of character, and nothing like the book at all. Bucky's ""Fire and Ice"" bit later, before Lee's body is incinerated, was a nice touch, though. The entire end of the movie was rife with symbolism, but odd, incorrect, and left me questioning: Ramona and Madeleine live in the novel. Why shed excess blood for a movie? And wouldn't Bucky get caught at the end? His happy return to Kay isn't so happy if the police are coming for him. Was that the point?The Linscotts (the Spragues in the novel) and their role in the Dahlia plot went mostly unsaid, though the big reveal at the end was neat, cinematography-wise. I didn't enjoy the actress who played Ramona AT ALL; her ""hopheadedness"" was so overplayed. But her face at the end, when she mimicked the slicing of Betty Short's face, tied in marvelously with the clown painting and the silent film at the beginning... making for a horrific yet interesting four-way parallel (Ramona, Betty, the film, and the painting). Looking at the Linscotts/Spragues and their involvement with the Dahlia, it takes reading the book AND watching the movie to get the whole effect: that Georgie's and Ramona's torture and murder of Betty Short was their twisted way of enacting how they feel about their bastard daughter Madeleine, the Dahlia's spitting image. Speaking of casting: I LOVED Josh Hartnett as Bucky Bleichert. He was perfect, perfect, perfect. Aaron Eckhart brought some warmth to a two-dimensional character. I also liked the guys who played Ellis Loew and Russ Millard; having read the book (where their characters are WAY more present), their characterisation was spot-on. Hillary Swank was too old to play Madeleine. Too old and too campy; what was with that accent? And Scarlett Johansson's performance was wooden at best. The '40s-era dialogue sounded forced coming from her. Overall, my independent Dahlia research combined with reading the book and watching this movie enriched my knowledge of the case and made me look at all of Ellroy's and De Palma's symbolism from a million different vantage points. I would only recommend one in conjunction with the other two.",The Black Dahlia

374,lmharnisch,Almost the Heaven's Gate of Film Noir,1,16 September 2006,"""The Black Dahlia"" is a long, bloated, confusing, self-important, self-consciously artsy movie undermined by miscasting, absurd plot turns, naive symbolism, an utter disdain for history and laughable overacting that make Robert Towne's ponderous, plodding ""Chinatown"" sequel, ""Two Jakes"" (1990), look like a taut thriller.The most marked difference between ""Dahlia"" and other classics of the more recent genre is that although ""L.A. Confidential"" is firmly planted in the 1950s and ""Chinatown"" takes place in the 1930s, De Palma's film has shallow roots ""once upon a time in Los Angeles."" Clearly, a movie nominally set in 1943-47 in which the lead characters attend a silent movie (""The Man Who Laughs, "" 1928--note that the characters are sitting in the balcony, which was reserved for blacks back in the ugly days of segregation. Oops!) has nothing but contempt for the past, which is reflected in a thousand ways, from male actors' scruffy haircuts and inability to wear hats properly to a laughable lesbian nightclub scene featuring K.D. Lang in top hat and tails singing ""Love for Sale,"" which rather than depicting the classic film noir era is most evocative of ""Bugsy Malone,"" a far more accurate film.One can find fatal flaws in virtually every area of this movie with little effortin fact the most difficult task in critiquing the film is remembering everything that's wrong with it.First, there's Josh Friedman's dialog: ""She looks like that dead girl! How sick are you?""not quite ""She's my sister and my daughter,"" is it? Then there's miscasting (at 31, Kirshner is much too old to play the 22-year-old Black Dahlia), opulent production design by Dante Ferretti (police officers lived like this on LAPD pay? Who knew?), music (Mark Isham in the entirely predictable ""cue mournful trumpet"" genre), odd costumingFriday casual for the men, fall collection for the women(Jenny Beavan), down to the crowd scenes, which are busy to the point of distraction. And I wish I had the cigarette holder franchise on this film. I would be a rich man.Even special effects are misused, with an earthquake that serves no purpose except to underline an obvious plot turn. Granted, the overly complex story is almost impossible to follow, but in this instance, De Palma must assume the audience has an IQ of about 50. And unlike the shocking and painfully realistic nose-slitting scene in ""Chinatown,"" the far worse violence inflicted on the Black Dahlia is amusingly fake. If De Palma was hoping to make a slasher flick, he failed badly.Nor does Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography escape a rap on the knuckles for a ridiculous lesbian stag film (presumably made at a cost surpassing the combined budgets of all blue movies produced from the 1920s to the 1950s), and a self-conscious and overly elaborate shot in which partners Blanchard (Eckhart) and Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) engage in a shootout, followed by the camera slowly rising up floor by floor of an entire apartment building, proceeding to a befuddling shot of the building's roof before it at last discovers the Black Dahlia's body in a vacant lot in the adjoining block. As visual storytelling, this is a grandiose and miserable failure. And then there's Fiona Shaw, who chews so much scenery that she must have been rushed to an oral surgeon to have the splinters removed.For that matterand perhaps this is what makes the heart of the film beat so faintlythere is very little of the Black Dahlia in ""The Black Dahlia,"" who only surfaces far into the picture.In fact, the first 30 or 40 minutes are devoted to boxing matches between the two detectives, nicknamed ""Fire"" and ""Ice"" from the Symbolism 101 school of writing. (I know it's in the book, but that's no excuse).So where is the Black Dahlia in this confusing mess? She exists entirely on film. Of course in real life, Elizabeth Short never got a screen test or even appeared in a school play, but De Palma gives her one and Kirshner, trying her best at the impossible task of acting 22, makes it as pitiful as possible with an intentionally miserable reading of Vivian Leigh's famous monologue from ""Gone With the Wind."" The handling of the crime scene? Ridiculous even by Hollywood's lax standards. Vintage black-and-white police cars swarming the streets and detectives bellowing instructions like some shark-jumping 1970s cop show that any good investigator would already know. Ditto the morgue.Then there's the contrasting love/sex scenes, and it's obvious De Palma hasn't a clue how to stage either one. The sex scene, between Harnett and Johansson, occurs in the dining room, when, overcome with passion, Bleichert rips away the tablecloth, sending dishes everywhere, and has his way with Lake. Isham's score is lushly romantic, an oddly contrasting choice of music, and amour like this is sure tough on the Havilland china and the Baccarat crystal.The love scene, between Swank and Harnett, is just as amusing with Bleichert and Linscott having a little pillow talk while she's wearing nothing but huge pearl earrings and a long matching necklace with pearls the size of small onions, ensuring, I would imagine, a rather bumpy ride.And about those crazy Linscotts. Bleichert knows exactly how to make rich people confess to murder: Use their valuable antiques for target practice. The last time I checked, police revolvers hold six rounds, so unless Bleichert was planning to fight off one of them as he reloaded I can't imagine what he thought he would do after his sixth question. Then again, not everybody can send a crystal chandelier crashing to the floor with one shotsome of us need two.And while you're at it, Bucky, take out a couple of those clown paintings, please.",The Black Dahlia
375,Sox575,Total Letdown!!!!,2,18 September 2006,"I gave ""The Black Dahlia"" two stars instead of one because I like Brian De Palma's work. The cinematography was great, as was the art direction and costume/set design.However, the convoluted story line, focusing on characters other than Elizabeth Short (Black Dahlia), diminish the impact of this film. The bulk of this movie centers on the two detectives and their common love interest, along with peripheral characters like an alleged lip-stick lesbian heiress (Swank) who ends up screwing one detective (Hartnett) every chance she gets (which is why I say ""alleged""), and her bizarre family members. The story line continues to follow these characters, I guess trying to contextualize the time period, but goes on long tangents that have nothing to do with the actual case. It leaves the viewer thinking, ""what does this have to do with anything?"" The Black Dahlia becomes a sidebar story. It's almost as if the crime is an afterthought. In all fairness, I didn't read the James Ellroy novel. But when I go to a movie entitled, ""THE BLACK DAHLIA,"" I expect to see a story focused on the black dahlia. What I got was a bunch of nonsense revolving around an implied three-way between two detectives nicknamed ""mr. fire"" and ""mr. ice"" and their pout-y blonde (wife?-starlette?-girlfriend?), and a lesbian whose eccentric mother might have been the dahlia killer--because her husband got off on lesbian porn--along with the mother's (brother? lover? whoever this character is)a deformed man that wanted more than just girl-on-girl action. I'm not sure who the disfigured man is because the character is suddenly introduced by name only and I'm not sure what connection he has with the lesbian's family, particularly the mother, but there you go. BTW, the lesbian ends up slitting the throat of ""mr. ice.""Confused? So was the audience.Very little had to do with Elizabeth Short... like who she was, what was going on in her life at the time, etc., and that's odd. Considering the brutal nature of the crime, the fact that it was never solved, and the mystery/rumors behind the actual victim, one would think that a movie focusing on Short and the crime/investigation would be enough.This is the first movie that I've been to where the audience actually booed when the credits rolled.",The Black Dahlia

377,Thun,What's wrong with you people?,7,27 February 2007,"(possible spoilers, I'm not keeping track.) Call yourselves De Palma fans? This movie was so luscious I never wanted it to end. Therefore I was pleased to see it go on and on with new plot... let's say... *developments*. This is simply a means (or excuse) to have more sumptuous screen time. Swank's delivery, simultaneously enjoyable and laughable, and deliberately fake, kinda sums up the whole enterprise. This movie feels much dirtier than L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, which I couldn't sit through--boring direction, for people who think plain reality is grim and venal? By the way, every ""random"" thing in that movie tied up too neatly later, too. At least De Palma casts American cops and only candy-coats his ugly truth cinematically: makes a movie you want to keep watching for sensual reasons.Hartnett was great, Eckhart was wasted, and Johansson joins the long history of untalented females in De Palma films (a challenge to himself? a statement on sex relations? note that this implies a certain power in all women, vs. the work the men are expected to do...) while Kirshner, dead, blows her away. My only complaint is that modern actors don't enunciate, so much of the 40s-era speech is lost, but the exposition is so tight you can't afford to lose even one line.And thank GODDD Fiona Shaw got a chance to come back and do some real stuff. She's too good to merely decorate the dinner table.I don't know if a movie like this SHOULD have a sincere emotional basis -- it's like a game where you're trying to keep up with all the token scenes you have to have in a big expensive commercial movie. For money reasons alone he probably couldn't have got the movie made without Johansson. And we get to see Bill Finley again.So I agree the plot meanders, but that's not the point. Or rather, it IS the point. How can anyone swallow the Rollo Tommassi thing and complain about this? At least stuff like k.d. lang (in her Fat Elvis phase) indicates the knowing joke. Did anyone ever think giant Kim Basinger looked like tiny Veronica Lake?",The Black Dahlia
378,BlackSox1919-1,A Hitch in Time,6,20 September 2006,"The good news is that Brian DePalma seems to have outgrown his slavish devotion to Hitchcock. Unfortunately, he seems to have done it right when it would have served him best. Given the material at hand--a lurid murder, a complex tale of suspense, and the rich backdrop of 1940's Hollywood--this film would have benefited from a healthy portion of Hitchcock. What should have been at the very least a visually rich film (with the wonderful costumes and the great Art Deco theme of the era) lies flat on the screen in almost muted tones. DePalma's camera angles and shot selection would have benefited from a more Hitchcockian eye, instead relying on tired editing tricks. And worst of all, the film lacks any sense of pacing and economy, becoming muddled and tedious at several points. Yet, the answer to the fundamental question that should be asked of any movie (""Was it worth the $8?"") is yes. A reserved, see-it-at-a-matinée-if-you-can yes, but still a yes.",The Black Dahlia

This film did not do it for me at all, it failed to keep me interested and I found myself asleep on my sofa after 40 minutes ish. I expected so much more form this film and was really disappointed. I like Hilary Swank and Josh Hartnett which is what is more annoying. It was not the actors that made this film bad; it was the poorly constructed storyline, the complicatedness of the narrative and the poor decisions made by De Palma as a director. A real let down, do not buy this film, do not rent this, don't even bother downloaded it for free of the internet because it still won't be worth the wait or your time.I assume he was going for the film noir style, but he just did not pull it off. Maybe he should watch L.A Confidential and get some ideas and a lesson in how to do it.

The second time through things became clearer and more satisfying, despite the problems of casting, performance, and direction that other reviewers have noted. Probably a viewer who had read the novel from which the script was built (I hadn't) would follow along in a first viewing. While I certainly don't mean that this movie is in the same league as Sleep and Mulholland, those were also movies that became much clearer to me on a second viewing.

This one isn't, but if you see it under the right auspice, it can be a positive experience for you. You have to forget the title. It's very misleading. Very early on I realized that this film had little to do with the actual ""Black Dahlia"" murder. If this film were billed as a film noir detective murder mystery omitting all references to ""The Black Dahlia"", first of all, it would have been fitting, secondly, I think it would have been more well-received. As a 40's era L.A. murder mystery, it's super. Tons of red herrings and twists and turns and sinister silhouetted faces in dark alleys. Lots of Spillane tough-guy cop talk and quick repartee. Endless twists. Shot beautifully, especially Scarlett Johansen who is carefully shot with Hollywood starlet glamour lighting and soft focus. Sex and seediness and bad guys and insane characters and plot twists, some which are far-fetched and don't work as well as others but who cares? Don't like one twist? Don't worry, another one, even more bizarre and out of left field is right behind it. If you go see this film expecting to see what really happened to ""The Black Dahlia"", I can promise you you'll be disappointed. But if you go in hoping to see a beautifully shot time-warp suspenseful murder mystery, you'll get every pennie's worth. Some people will undoubtedly call this film a mess.

The Black Dahlia is a fascinating story and I was really expecting so much more about it. As one reviewer said, you don't even hear about the Dahlia until 1/3 of the way into the movie! This movie should not have been called the Black Dahlia. It should have had a different title...maybe Fire and Ice or something.

Finally when it starts to talk about her, ""bam"" it jumps to another character and talks about their life, then ""bam"" it jumps to about four more characters and talks about their life...then comes back to E.

My husband actually fell asleep and I was yawning but didn't leave cause I wanted to get my monies worth (ofcourse that didn't work out).

384,Thorbejorn,good looking but hard to watch,3,28 September 2006,"I was so looking forward to this film. The historic murder case is compelling and the fact that it was done on high def video makes it a film of the future. But I was completely turned around from the first moment. I thought that this was going to be a film about the Black Daliah. I thought that we would be interested in her. It took me over a half an hour to realize that the movie was about a boxer turned cop and his boxer pal and his girlfriend. By that time I was disengaged. When the Black Daliah finally appeared in the middle of the film I was reconnected. But the story about the cops just missed me. And I was totally disinterested in Scarlet Johanson's character, and I usually like her.Over all, as a movie it was not a big success. But it does hold some place in on the list of historic murder cases retold. But compared to Citizen X, a great historic murder tale told through the cop's eyes, this does not compare.There are some great psycho killer biopics out there. I wish that this was one of them.",The Black Dahlia
385,dustheim,"Visually tasteful, yet lacking overall",3,21 September 2006,"The moment I set eyes on the trailer for ""The Black Dahlia,"" I felt a tinge of what might be a good 40's era crime drama. The trailer piqued my interest so much, I immediately set out to purchase and read James Ellroy's novel from which that movie was to be based. Little did I know that an offhand comment from a friend, who also watched the trailer, that the movie ""sounded alright but got retarded"" would prove so eerily true.In Ellroy's novel, you follow the main character Bucky Bleichart through his highs and lows as a post-war Los Angelos policeman. It was ripe with dark and seemingly convoluted plot lines through LA's (and at one point Mexico's) less than attractive and often corrupt history and public institutions. In the end, though, you're rewarded with an excellent telling of Bucky's life and how the events that unraveled from the Black Dahlia case forced deep and unsettling emotions. All of this culminating in a twisted yet somewhat believable ending.Having been so enthralled with the book, I was expecting the typical Hollywood slashing of the story, yet still expecting it to maintain the intense moods and emotion. The beginning of the movie played out surprisingly as I had expected it to, and it did so to an adequate degree of quality. The only problem with this happened to be that the movie held the exposition's importance for way too long. The Black Dahlia's body hadn't been discovered in enough time for my interest in the case or story to grow.From this point on, the plot of the movie takes multiple poor turns, straying from some of the darker, more sinister, and more captivating scenes in the book. Everything has less and less to do with the Black Dahlia investigation that at one point, I wondered if it was even going on in the story. A few vague references to the case later, I realize the picture's trying to hold on to that aspect of the plot, but not very well.Most disappointing of all was the ending. What should have progressed throughout the whole movie took place in the last twenty minutes with one unexplained revelation after another. With such a quick pace, the twist didn't make sense or seem to have anything to do with the rest of the plot. The ending tied up, but not as neatly as it could have, which would still have been quite a bit less neat than the book for obvious reasons.Disappointing as the plot may be, still more troubles trailed behind the movie. All of the leading actors, some of which questionable in their casting for some, left a lot to be desired. A few, like Scarlet Johannson and Josh Hartnett, brought too little to their characters, so they came across wholly unconvincing. Yet others, like Aaron Eckhart and Fiona Shaw, went a bit overboard at times, effectively draining the believability of their characters as they had been established for most of their screen time. One of the few leads to accomplish a decent performance was Hilary Swank. She fit the role of a temptress with dark secrets quite well, and her only downfall might have been a somewhat inconsistent dialect. In fact, the most convincing acting came from the minor, background characters. Mia Kirshner did quite well as the Dahlia; her performance left an appropriately haunting impression considering her limited screen time.I attribute a bit of the poor performances on poor direction for the actors. Some scenes, namely a few sex scenes, were directed in a way that left me feeling awkward watching such an equally awkward display of passion. In many moments, his direction seemed to head towards being a parody of Film Noir, and if that was his intent, great, but it was unfitting for the emotions and moods that should have been going on throughout the film. I think DePalma fared quite well directing some of the little details that come together to make a convincing show, but he stumbled through the more significant direction of actors, editing, and content.What the movie accomplished well was nearly everything visual. Every detail from wardrobe and hair to the sets screamed perfect portrayal of the late 40's. Just about everything looked good. My only exception to the rule would be a moment during a death scene where the ""gore"" looked hokey.Overall, the movie showed what could be done well with an adaptation of James Ellroy's novel, but missed it by a mile. Everything came together to look pretty, but left behind an empty feeling, yearning for much needed emotion and mood that made the novel a notable read.",The Black Dahlia

But from the outset I was so disappointed in this movie and I was really looking forward to it! My interest in the Elizabeth Short murder aside, I believed this would be a marvellous film, but the combination of Scarlett Johannsen's uncomfortable imitation of a sex bomb, Josh Hartnett's wooden acting Aaron Ekharts over-acting and the comedy ending left me completely stunned into silence!! For some reason it seemed everybody except Elisabeth Short had an attack of bad acting syndrome!! It was comical in places and I was also mystified by the need for the over convoluted plot they developed to try and attach to the murder suggested by the title.

Now with the Black Dahlia as subject matter & Brian Depalma directing it should have been in the good to excellent range. Wrong again. Could be way off base here but I think they were going for a David Lynch feel ,& if that's the case it also failed miserably.

388,donkeyfur,"Preposterous events, poor script",4,15 September 2006,"If you have never read anything about the actual Black Dahlia case of 1947 you might find a way to enjoy this film, although even then you're likely to find the film's version of events preposterous. I have never seen such a pedigreed Hollywood film with such strange character motivations and absurd coincidences. The script has characters spouting howlingly awful lines. There's nothing funny about the hideous way Elizabeth Short (the so-called Black Dahlia) was murdered, but the audience in the screening I saw were chuckling at much of the dialogue.The film has a disclaimer that the case was never officially solved and that the movie is based on the fictional novel by James Ellroy. I have not read the book and, assuming the movie closely followed it, I have no desire to.This film is like other movies ""based on"" actual murders that go off on bizarre tangents rather than following what is actually known about the real-life cases. The saying goes, ""truth is stranger is fiction."" Sometimes that may be true, but the events in this movie are about as strange as it gets.Personally, I recommend reading the fact-based book ""Black Dahlia Avenger"" by Steve Hodel. I found his work to be far more interesting, compelling and scary than Brian De Palma's ""The Black Dahlia"". I shudder to think of all the people who are going to believe the film's version of events and go around passing them off as reality.Yes, it's true the case was never officially solved, but Hodel, a former L.A. police detective, presents solid, comprehensive evidence whether or not you accept who he suggests is the culprit -- who he said had an accomplice. Hodel believes two men were serial killers in L.A. in that era and provides a look at similarities between all the unsolved cases. However, the Black Dahlia case was by far the most gruesome.I mention in passing that there's a lurid and not very believable book on the Black Dahlia case called ""Severed"" by John Gilmore that is of note because it includes more photos of the victim, including the morgue photos. This is not for the faint of heart!The film ""Black Dahlia"" does score points for successfully recreating the L.A. of the 1940s. The costumes and settings are convincing, even if the acting by some of the stars is not.I think Elizabeth Short -- the Black Dahlia -- deserves a better ""obituary"" than this film. I'm sure I would have seen the film in any case, but, in retrospect, I'm sorry I took the afternoon off to see it on its debut date.",The Black Dahlia
389,rayovac,It's bad enough when the professional critics do it...,8,17 September 2006,"I think that Brian De Palma has made his share of poor movies (Mission to Mars, anyone?), but to hear regular moviegoers criticizing this film (not all, but a fair number) just blows me away.The only explanation that I can come up with is that the level of expectation with De Palma is so high that he, himself, can rarely meet it.If this film were to be viewed as an Indie from an unknown Director, it would be receiving rave reviews. The photography is amazing, the Hitchcock - like use of color and shadow, and the editing all make this a beautiful film to look at...but that's not where it shines (in my opinion).The plot, I believe, is fantastic...that's right, I said it: This is a great story.This is coming from someone who despised ""Mullholland Drive"" because I found the story impossible to follow and thought that it only appealed to aloof ""art film"" types who want to show how their ""acquired taste"" in cinema is one that normal folk are just too simple to appreciate.Simply put: I don't care for complex and confusing story lines.I found this film to be *very* linear and (aside from a few plot details that were mumbled more than highlighted), easy to follow and riveting.I think the acting was excellent as well. There has been some criticism of Hillary Swank...but consider the challenges associated with playing a Scottish-American, sex-hungry bisexual living with her parents in Los Angeles at the time. Further, compound this by adding in the conflict that the character faces during this time in her life. I think few women in Hollywood could have pulled off this role as well.Josh Hartnett also did an excellent job. His scenes with his father are alone worth the price of admission. His narration carried the elaborate storyline and his character's reactions to the unfolding events maintained the stability of what could have turned out to be an out-of-control spiral...no small feat.I found this film to be a return (in some ways) to De Palma's efforts in ""Body Double"" and ""Dressed to Kill""...a steamy mystery with all of the trappings of the classic thriller. De Palma *is* channeling Hitchcock...by design or otherwise...and the results are breathtaking.Set your expectations to a normal level and judge the film on it's own (not in the context of other De Palma masterpieces or ""LA Confidential"")...you'll be pleasantly surprised!",The Black Dahlia

Johanson was miscast as was Swank (although Swank is generally a good actress in other films). The plot is convoluted beyond anyones general concept of the Black Dahlia story. I was told that this film was a real disappointment by my friends who saw it in a theatre, so I watched it on DVD and almost walked out of my own living room. On the positive side, the photography, production design and the music were acceptable. But is it just me or does most of the dialog sound like clichés from other film noir films?

It's a film that you really have to pay attention to the littlest of details, mostly because they do pop up again at the end when the filmmaker makes a desperate attempt to wrap the thing up after realizing he probably spend way too much money in making this film which for all intents and purposes makes no sense.",The Black Dahlia

There is no satisfaction in finding out why someone acted some way or who surprisingly gets killed and by whom if I am just a passenger along for the strenuously long ride without a need for a brain, whose only way of figuring out what happened is to wait and let one of the characters tell about it. He killed him because!"" Oh, and then another, about something else. And another. Ah, but no, what the first character said actually wasn't true... It was THIS way... believe me. Please?The film simply lacks credibility and doesn't get the viewer involved. Half-way through, if not earlier, I was wondering if all of this was serious, or if it was really some kind of comedy. Maybe it was, even though it's hard to say, because the characters weren't really doing anything funny or laughing, although the acting and display of emotions of both Scarlett Johannson and Aaron Eckhart were mostly laughable.I'm easily entertained; I don't have high expectations of movies. My tickets to this show were even free. Yet I regret having gone. Perhaps ""The Black Dahlia"" worked as a book.

An all-star cast of actors and actresses. The author of ""LA Confidential."" The director of ""Scarface"" and ""The Untouchables."" Sometimes, even with all of the right elements, a movie can still suck. ""The Black Dahlia"" is the latest film from Brian De Palma. Based on a famous unsolved Los Angeles murder, the movie follows detectives Bucky Bleichert (Josh Harnett) and Lee Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) as they search for the killer of an aspiring actress. Much like ""LA Confidential,"" the movie is a period piece full of hats, film noir talking and, of course, dames, like Scarlett Johansson and Hilary Swank. Johansson plays Kay Lake, Blanchard's girlfriend who clearly has a thing for Bliechert. The three of them hang out constantly, and they give off a weird three-way vibe that doesn't make sense. Meanwhile, Bliechert is attracted to Swank's character Madeleine Linscott, a former lover of the murdered actress who looks exactly like her. Bliechert becomes more and more suspicious of Linscott and even the police department as he and Blanchard sink deeper and deeper into the murder. From there, the movie just becomes boring and confusing. There is almost little to no character development, so basically when characters are either killers or hurt, no one really cares. Instead of being a gritty, twisting thrill ride like ""LA Confidential"" or De Palma's other movies, ""Dahlia"" comes off as a whiny, drawn-out borefest. The murder of the Black Dahlia actress doesn't even happen until about halfway into the movie. But wait John, you just said that there is no character development, but also there is no action until well into the movie? That doesn't make sense. Exactly John. The film introduces so many characters and situations that the audience doesn't really know what is going on. Not to mention there is no telling who is friends, enemies, lovers or anything else. The movie moves slow even for a period piece, and the audience's attention is lost very quickly. Even the ending comes out of nowhere. The killers are all revealed, and it makes no sense. There is no way the audience could have figured it out. It lasts so long that it is almost annoying to watch things being revealed over and over with more people involved. The only sense of total relief is when the credits start rolling. Unless you are in the perfect mood, this is a movie is something to avoid. A fantastic cast with good performances just isn't enough sometimes to make a crappy movie good. Yawn. I'm already bored talking about it. I didn't like ""The Black Dahlia.""",The Black Dahlia
395,brmcdonald,Mediocre Film Noir,3,20 September 2006,"Previous reviewers have adequately captured both the essential mediocrity of this film and the ballot-stuffing efforts to artificially elevate its rating. Reviewing the current voting distribution reveals a disproportionate number of 1 ratings as well as 10s. To be fair and balanced, assigning it a 1 is almost as egregious as giving it a 10. This film is not in the same league as ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" as an example of bad film-making and Brian DePalma certainly has a better resume than Ed Wood. IMHO, the cinematography alone, in giving the viewer the visceral feel of post-war LA, elevates it to at least a 3.

396,AlonzoQuijana,Style Over Substance,2,18 September 2006,"I long for the days of Jack Warner whose studio could produce densely plotted 90-minute film noirs that were not only atmospheric but told an engaging, entertaining and, above all, comprehensible story. The characters were well drawn, plot points clear, the writing crisp and energetic. There was substance and style. And always a hero, flawed as he may be. Alas, like so much in our culture today the genre has been debased and we find ourselves with the over-stylized, zero-substance, slightly smutty, voyeuristic, almost campy Black Dahlia. The disappointments in this film are numerous. Most flawed is the writing. It's as if an over- eager film student pasted together random paragraphs from every sixth or seventh page of the James Elmore book padded by long scenes that did not advance the plot or were there just to shock, and completely over-the-top, camp moments. (Guilty pleasure: Fiona Shaw's drunkologues as Mama Linscott). The writing is at times almost telegraphic and digital at other times turgid and flabby. It screams for a competent editor.And then there is the sound. Why is it that as sound technology has advanced, dialog becomes harder and harder to understand. I have perfect hearing and the theatre has the latest and greatest acoustics and speakers, but too many of the lines were just muffled. The net effect of the choppy writing and sound was that audience members were constantly turning to each other and asking ""What happened?"" ""He said what?"" ""Did she say?""That said, the sets, costumes and mid-century L.A. ambiance are gorgeous. De Palma gets this right. But all visuals, no plot make for thin gruel. As for the cast, Josh Hartnett (Bucky) was wildly miscast. He's way too young, fresh-faced and ""pretty"" for his role as boxer-turned cop  a cross between an A&F model and an Eagle Scout. Aaron Eckhart, who plays the older partner Lee Blanchard is one-dimensional and not very convincing in his obsessions and weaknesses. But Kudos to Mia Kirshner who delivers a memorable performance as the needy, too-willing-to-please Elizabeth Short in the smarmy film-within-a-film.

399,TerminalMan,"Flawed, but not unwatchable (Some very minor spoilers)",6,3 May 2008,"The IMDb is full of negative reviews of ""The Black Dahlia"", and while I agree with a number of the complaints, I still didn't find it nearly as bad as described by the masses.True, it is indeed flawed, and much of this is the result of Josh Friedman's screenplay. Granted, James Ellroy's novel is extremely complex and has a great many subplots that are very important to understanding the characters and their motivations, so trimming the material down to accommodate the approximately two hours of screen time means the removal of many of these scenes. This results in characters whose motivations and actions are sometimes questionable and baffling, relationships between some of the lead characters somewhat unclear, and an ending that, while relatively appropriate to the actual Black Dahlia murder, is still a bit unsatisfying.Also, some of the casting decisions go from questionable to downright absurd, which of course results in some awkward and almost laughable character interaction.But, despite these flaws, there are also many things about the film I enjoyed. Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography is absolutely beautiful, and Brian De Palma's direction, while not his best work, handled the story quite well. I was particularly impressed by the fact that the tortured and mutilated body of Elizabeth Short was not flaunted across the screen for shock value at every possible opportunity simply to appease the blood and gore fans. Rather, the main focal point is the growing obsession of the two main characters to find out who would do it and why. Also, there are some very good performances that deserve more credit than they have been given.All things considered, the film falls short of being the crime-noir suspense/thriller it was intended to be, but is by no means unwatchable, or even a ""bad"" film. There are certainly much worse examples of failed film-noir efforts.While it's not ""The Maltese Falcon"" or ""The Killing"" by any means, it's a decent, entertaining film that doesn't deserve such overwhelmingly negative criticism.",The Black Dahlia
400,chunice,i didn't enjoy the movie.,5,3 March 2007,"A lot of it wasn't very clear but I suppose you would have had to read the book to understand a lot of what was going on. There was no movie-person connection because the movie seemed to go on for ages. Some parts, you'd stare at the screen and go ""what just happened?"" or you'd ask why it happened. I think the audience would grasp the movie better, appreciate more and be a lot more entertaining if it were a play instead of a movie. Josh Hartnett engaged in sexual intercourse often throughout the movie. The ending was the best part simply because the movie was over and everything started to make sense because the mystery was finally being solved.",The Black Dahlia

I would not recommend this movie as a murder mystery.Instead we got a long drawn out story that went WAY off the murder into several other side stories. We found it tedious and the acting was OK and the girl on girl thing was mildly exciting. We did however enjoy the 1940's looks and attitudes.

It would seem as though this movie was made for ""dump to DVD"", since most of the dialogue had me watching 30 ft tall faces. The sound was as lousy as the visuals.

I am sure that the producers were trying to leave some dignity to the horribly mutilated young lady for liability purposes, and rightfully so,(the gay porno scenes, real dignified) but how many times has Hollywood really pushed the buck for a buck? I caught a piece of an interview with Scarlett Johannson and I thought that she had the part of Betty Short. Maybe next time.

Then all bets are off. The movie goes off in so many silly directions I couldn't keep up with the theme, plot or whatever it was supposed to be.Childish filming techniques like slow-motion photography (during a scene where shots are fired) and the mumbling narration made me want laugh or pull my hair out.

405,domjoli,does the LAPD check on its missing officers?,4,7 July 2007,"There are worse movies than ""Black Dahlia"", but not that many in the category of major releases. Brian de Palma employs many of his old tricks. The introduction to the major theme is handled a la Hitchcock; the discovery of the corpse is seen as a backdrop to a subplot scene. While this is cinematically commendable, the rest of the film contains questionable scenes. When Aaron Eckhart's character is killed off, it begs the question of LAPD procedure. If one of their officers is killed wouldn't a full scale investigation occur? Instead, we are treated to the casual disposal of his body beneath the eyes of his partner who later informs a superior that Mr. Eckhart's character will not be returning. No investigation? No Inspector's funeral? Rather, I believe this is a loose end in the film. The Dahlia case is celebrated as an unsolved mystery. Yet, Josh Hartnett solves it in the film. Why does he keep it quiet? Too many loose ends in a carefully and artistically made film. Brian de Palma always seems to just miss.",The Black Dahlia

""The Black Dahlia"" is a bad movie that's quite entertaining, usually for all the wrong reasons. Hilary Swank's character has the most confusing accent. She sounds like she's trying to channel Katharine Hepburn, but Hepburn was from a patrician New England family and Swank's character is supposed to have grown up in LA. Fiona Shaw, usually a wonderful actress, plays Swank's mother and you can't understand a single word she says. Her bizarre speech patterns become a huge problem at the end because she's the one who explains what really happened. The most frustrating part of the movie--for me--was that every five minutes some character commented on how Swank looked just like the Black Dahlia. In fact, Hillary Swank and the actress playing Elizabeth Short look NOTHING alike. That plot point was just utterly stupid. If someone did a film noir version of ""Mystery Science Theater,"" this movie would be perfect.",The Black Dahlia

Its poorly written, poorly acted, poorly directed, and the whole Dahlia case takes a back seat to a story that is convoluted and half baked at best.There was no ""flow"" to the movie. For the first 30 minutes I thought I was following the story, but after that just a overwhelming number of new subplots just pop up out of no where.The clichés from tradition noir movies of the era really wear out their welcome. It was just way too over done. The dialog was forced and the analogies really become annoying.And it went on forever. I kept waiting for the movie to end, and it just kept coming up with new subplots that came out of thin air to explain something you saw 1 and a half hours ago that didn't add anything to the story.The acting was stale, but I blame the script for that. It was really just hard to stay with the movie, because things didn't seem to happen for any rhyme or reason.Seriouly, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. Rent it if you must, but don't spend 10 dollars on this.

408,kkrug,There's a reason there is no plot synopsis,3,4 July 2007,"I spent an awful lot of time trying to figure out what was going on in this movie. Which is odd, because I am a long-time film noir buff as well as an actual criminal lawyer who has worked on a fair number of actual murder cases. So I rushed to IMDb after watching this movie to help me sort it out - alas, no plot synopsis. Which makes sense - one would need to construct a Venn Diagram and a flow chart to sort out who did what to whom and why. Once we do get to the whodunit portion of the movie, it feels like a tacked-on afterthought and is completely unbelievable. They might as well have pinned the murder of ""The Dahlia"" on the (stuffed) dog.However, as a work of visual art, this movie is mesmerizing. It looks like an old hand-tinted postcard. I did not see a lot of the shadowy noir visual conventions I have come to expect, but there were many shades of brown to look at. Hilary Swank, Josh Hartnett, Aaron Eckhart, and Scarlett Johansson, as well as the Dahlia herself (Mia Kirschner) were all stunning, of course. But then, so was the photographic layout based upon this movie in Vanity Fair.This movie needed something it did not have to get past its own sepia-toned veneer - a coherent plot and better acting. Mr. Hartnett was earnestly compelling most of the time, but the real standout was Mia Kirschner, whose character, through a series of film clips, seemed convincingly tailor-made for the land of broken dreams. I guess it says something about a movie when the standout player is the corpse. First runner up is the (stuffed) dog.This movie gets three stars because it is very pretty.",The Black Dahlia

The wait is over! - and the movie is great!The cast is perfect, the film looks great, the script is well paced - the film has everything you want from a great Film Noir!The Crime Plot revolving around the main characters is based on the true story of the murder of Elizabeth Short (known as ""The Black Dahlia"") but the characters - and the story of the film - are fictitious!The buddy-stuff between the two cops Dwight ""Bucky"" Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) and Leland ""Lee"" Blanchard (Aaron Eckhardt) works great, but a couple of more scenes together would have been even better! The Love-Triangle between the two of them and Blanchards wife Kaye Lake (Scarlett Johansson) is perfect! They accomplish more, in the first act, with a couple of close-ups and some bits of dialog (a very fine scene when Kaye says to Bucky ""Look at that smile now"" when see realizes how happy he is seeing her!) than PEARL HARBOR did in 3 hours!Writer Josh Friedman utilizes the best parts from the Story of James Ellroys overstuffed novel and succeeds. The Crime Story even starts at the beginning of Act 2. (A well shoot and edited boxing match between Mr. Fire (Eckhardt's nickname) & Mr. Ice (Hartnetts nickname) is the highlight of act 1!)I can't even spoil too much because I would have to write more than I was supposed to tell!The Flashbacks, with the help of a casting video of Elizabeth Short, show us a very childlike-erotic (I know how weird it sounds!) ""Black Dahlia"" and Mia Kirschner plays her so lasciviously that everyone of us becomes a voyeur. The fact that the interviewer, in those casting films, is voiced by DePalma himself, makes the whole thing even more interesting!The Actors:Josh Hartnett - I was afraid he wasn't the right one, but after SIN CITY I'm more confident about his selections. He's great in this one!Aaron Eckhardt - I'm a fan of him since THANK YOU FOR SMOKING! He's great here too, but I didn't knew that he wasn't a main character like Hartnett!Scarlett - great as usual, not ""femme fatale"" enough. But her character isn't supposed to be that way.Hilary Swank - ""THE"" Femme Fatale of this show. I never realized how alluring she could be!Mark Isham composed the score for this film - and it's a great one! The music reminds of the classics of Bernard Herrman or David Raskin's LAURA or the two masterpieces by Jerry Goldsmith: CHINATOWN and L.A. CONFIDENTIAL! It's (imho) the best score (till now) of the year!Ishams Themes sound like a continuation of the music Goldsmith wrote for the films of Roman Polanski and Curtis Hanson!

I also never could have expected such abhorrent acting from such an excellent cast. Scarlet Johansen was an afterthought whose character had as much depth as Lindsay Lohan's personality. Aaron Eckhart did the best he could with his ""hopped up on goofballs"" role, whereas Josh Hartnett never rose above the dark/brooding monotone played throughout the film.Lastly, I get that this was a period noir film, but they trotted out every last cliché (and then some) to beat you over the head with.

But unfortunately it did not live up to expectations.Don't get me wrong, the film is watchable. I just thought the acting was pretty substandard, Josh Hartnett not being anywhere near good enough for the leading role. The story line was also plain ridiculous, especially the ending which i hated. The murder itself was almost a side-line to the story, which is stupid considering how dramatic it is (when compared to Josh Hartnett's acting) and the Dahlia herself is hardly mentioned. I know the book mainly focuses on the detectives than the case itself, but according to people i know who have read it, the film is a poor adaptation of the book anyway.The film just really wasted an infamous murder which deserved a better dramatic adaptation. In some ways i hope someone remakes this film in a few years time and does it well, or makes another film based on the Black Dahlia murder and not the book, because it could be great. This film was too much like 'From Hell' - the true-story it was based on should have made it a good film, but it just wasn't.Also why was this film a 15 and not an 18? I'm not advocating gratuitous violence, but when the main themes are sex, porn, violence and one of the most gruesome murders ever it really should have been all out and not watered down.",The Black Dahlia

The use of color, the sharp contrast of black and white, good and evil, and so on. Based on that, I'd probably give the movie a 3.However, to put it simply, the plot and acting in this movie is terrible. Here is me fundamental rule in movies: You have to actually CARE about the characters and what they were going through. And, trust me, I didn't care.

416,klaramee-1,Another letdown from De Palma,3,25 September 2006,"This movie falls into the same category that History of Violence did for me. Good actors, talented director and lousy result. It seems to me that this movie was 1 or 2 rewrites away from being very good (as was HOV). The male leads, Aaron Eckhart and Josh Hartnett were good, though not great. The actresses were almost universally bad. Mia Kirshner was the only exception, but she's used sparingly (sadly). I hope she gets more work, fast - based on this performance. Kirshner was the only actress who seemed remotely natural. Scarlett Johansson and Hilary Swank both turned in stilted, affected performances. Maybe that's what the director wanted, I don't know - but it didn't work at all. I still fail to see the intrigue with Johansson. Aside from her (obvious) physical attributes...she has turned in nothing bu average performances time and again. The story got to be a muddled mess requiring numbing exposition. The writer and director should have re-watched LA Confidential to get a better sense of the movie they were trying to make, but didn't. De Palma now has more misses than hits at this point. He (and Cronenberg after HOV) should take a long holiday and come back in several years after having a creative enema.

One can neither snigger at its knowingness nor lose oneself in nostalgia. This lack of coherence is exacerbated by an unnecessarily convoluted plot and Bucky's incomprehensible narration, which is delivered an octave lower than the character's dialogue, why? In addition to this confusion the performances are at times quite frankly embarrassing. Scarlett Johansson's Lana Turner-esquire vamp is vacant, Hilary Swank's femme fatale is fatal, and Josh Hartnett is not so much the emotionally contained noiresque anti-hero as emotionally illiterate. Fiona Shaw, however, is excellent as the drug crazed matriarch - the one highlight of the film. It is, however, as if she's walked onto the set from another, much more entertaining film, as her performance has no part in The Black Dahlia.De Palma's use of violence is gratuitous and misogynistic. The visual brutality of the violence, in a film with such little substance, stands out as just that and at points the film seems to resemble a 1940s slasher movie - a novel concept if the director had stuck with it!

421,ric-56,A film noir like those of long ago,8,2 November 2006,"The ""Black Dhalia"" is a great black movie. There is mystery, emotion and happen many things. Some people think that this film treats only on the horrible murder of a small poor woman. But in fact it is a film that speaks on the human condition (the corruption, desires, the power, the ill minds) and about the love. Some scenes can be confused, but is not strange the real life and the human behavior? The film begins explaining that we lived in a violent world, hundreds of sailors and police sticking in one night crazy. What city! From the beginning the film explains to us that in the life it is necessary to fight (boxing, to investigate, to watch) to prosper. There are small scenes wonderful, difficult to see in the American cinema of nowadays: the blonde girl with scars in its body (on the top of the stairs) that discovers that it is observed by the best friend of his boyfriend. A scared girl who feels fear seeing an old silent film of terror (Conrad Veidt) and takes the hand of her cop boys. The scene in which we see the corpse of Elizabeth Short for the first time is extraordinary. There is traveling with crane that rises on a motel and then we see far, on a field, like a broken doll, a blurred ghost. Brian De Palma is one of the best directors of his generation. He usually tries to make films of adults, no trivial infantile films with absurd special effects. I like his slow motion, the flashbacks, the surprises that we are knowing. I do not understand because people compare this film with ""L.A. Confidencial"". I read ""The Black Dhalia"" three years ago and is a good adaptation. It is not a masterpiece as ""Carlito's way"" but is a good film, very entertained. Ricardo",The Black Dahlia

First of all it was WAY overacted, anyone who says differently must be a big fan of David Caruso. Whether it was meant to be this way, as in many of the movies of that time period, or not is not known, but it was overacted and laughable because of it. I mean the scene with Hartnett and Johansson on the table, the way he methodically throws everything on the table on the floor, what a joke. The film is also very sloppily edited and maybe even directed. De Palma's need to leave out details and then throw them together as Hartnett solves the puzzle at the end, leaves the audience confused and just not caring entirely about anyone in the story. Others could argue that it lets the audience solve the puzzle with Hartnett, but the lack of supporting character development leaves the audience uncaring about what the outcome will be.

The Black Dahlia does fall into the trap which is why it sounds more like Calvin and Hobbes' parody of the Noir genre when Calvin dreams of himself as Traces Bullet (and says the line above). The movie feels like a child's fantasy of abundance. When we are dying for a dessert our imagination takes us to the window of a pastry shop, however we know very well that if we started to eat all that is inside the shop it would not constitute a dessert but a grotesque binge. This movie feels like the 1940's movie equivalent: we dream of one and mentally we pack it full of everything that we can think of the period. The result is a cinematic binge. As far as the cast is concerned Eckhart is great but not dark enough, Josh Hartnett is awful (the same style he used in Sin City worked there but only because it was a comic inspired situation), Hilary Swank lacks the voluptuousness her character should have (and what's with the accent? I know they were trying to do something with it, but they failed), Scarlett Johansson has tons of it but as someone else noticed there is something wrong with her performance.

Must admit though that it cannot be compared to Sin City which is a much greater movie, it still has some kind of a nice catch that made it worthy to see. I absolutely loved the scenes with Elizabeth Short in it. I never heard about Mia Kirschner before this movie, but liked her acting much more than that of Scarlett (hers I did not like at all but maybe it is the character) or even Hillary Swank who was considerably better than Johansson. But no matter how much I liked the mood of the movie I still cannot give it a higher rating than 6 because of the slow pace and the endlessly curving story - sometimes I though this one is never going to reach its conclusion while I watched it. Also I liked the side characters much more than the main ones. Scarlett played a dull character. Bucky was fine but far from touching. They could have put a bit more spice into them please.

My husband and I were very disappointed. The best I can say about Josh Hartnett is that he was not as bad as I thought he would be. Most of the characters were mere vignettes of what was in the book. It was over done, under done and completely muddled. I have heard that Mr. Ellroy was satisfied with the results. I don't believe it. If you saw LA Confidential and loved it you will get a big let down with Dahlia, a mere shadow of what it could have been. It was a complete waste of money. The only bright spot was when Madeleine, while discussing her mother with Bucky, called her mother a hop-head and a movie goer in front of us said to his companion ""Did she say Hobbit?"" I'm not sure Brian De Palma was ever on the set. Everyone seemed left to their own interpretations of what ever they thought their part was about.

430,daniel-1174,"Close, but no cigar (ette)",7,13 October 2006,"Having read James Ellroy's novel and under the knowledge of Brian De Palma's direction, I was expecting the film to pay close attention to the psychological impact the Black Dahlia case had on both Bleichard and Bucky, especially the latter character. The film hinted at this slightly, but it didn't completely reflect Ellroy's disturbing, dirty and dark world.De Palma's direction was excellent, and he certainly produced shocking and nasty moments. His use of long shots created an incredibly claustrophobic feel when Bucky first meets Madeleine's family, and he makes great use of the discovery of the Elizabeth Short's corpse with a shot from a crane.Hilary Swank and Aaron Eckhart's characters were most believable, while Mia Kirshner was credible as the failing actress and doomed Elizabeth Short. Josh Hartnett produced a convincing performance, but it was slightly hindered by the fact that writer Josh Friedman didn't portray him as a man so evidently mentally scarred by the case. Scarlett Johansson, disappointingly, made less compelling viewing, and she didn't look comfortable holding that cigarette of hers. The set design and cinematography made the film look sumptuous, and the 1940s were definitely brought back to life on screen.'The Black Dahlia' is a pleasure to watch, and it deserves more credit than it has received. Yet although De Palma's direction was tight and absorbing, the detrimental effect the case had on Bucky mentally was central to the novel, and the film's omission of this makes it less laudable.",The Black Dahlia

I loved the weird characters that Brian DePalma allowed his actors to create.I thought the Josh Hartnett voice-over was excellent, giving it a noir post-WWII flavor as well as stability. I read that James Elroy said that the movie was good, but that his book was better. I think he is wrong: The book was OK; the movie was great.The solution offered by the movie is true to the book, but with embellishments. In my opinion, the killer or killers have never been mentioned as suspects in real life, and will never be identified--no matter how many now older adults insist that their parents did it.Visually, the movie was perfect and surreal in its own right. Josh Hartnett led the cast with his caring portrayal of Buckey Blechert. Aaron Eckhart's Lee Blanchard cared too, but he not only had his own agenda, he had his own secret self that made him a less likable character. Scarlett Johansson portrayed any of a dozen characters that June Allyson played at the time, but with a troubled past. She and Hillery Swank, among the leads played over the top like the lesser characters, and both did an excellent job.Not much suspense, I didn't think; not even much surprise, but of course, I did read the book.We'll never find an acceptable solution to the Black Dahlia Murder; there is none.

Not only was it really long and boring but it's not even about Elizabeth Short, the Black Dahlia. The movie is about a couple of detectives trying to solve a case. They talk about her for maybe 3 minutes of what feels like a 9 hour long movie. Plus, she's made out to be a lesbian prostitute, which isn't known to be true. I felt sickened after seeing this because an actual murder once took place which happened to involve one of the worst cases of torture and brutality ever known.

The plot was not only unnecessarily sadistic and pornographic, but extremely difficult to follow with a ridiculous conclusion. I'm sure it was intended to re-create the images of the early Hollywood ""film noir"" movies, however, this one was sadly lacking. Hilary Swank so overplayed her part, she came off more like a cartoon character like the ones that played in Warren Beatty's ""Dick Tracy"". Scarlett Johannson was the only credible person in the film. In the end, there is only so much you can do with lighting and melodramatic music. Sooner or later you need a story that engages the audience. Unfortunately, that never happens with this movie. This was more like the macabre, class B, horror films of early Hollywood with lots of lesbian porno moves. It also, does not tell the truth of the real person of Elizabeth Short and makes her out to be this pathetic twisted girl.

It's one of the worst movies I've seen in years (all 4 of us agreed). Two hours of torture. Hard to believe it came from Brian DePalma, or anyone else for that matter. ""The Black Dahlia"" manages to combine all of the right ingredients for a supreme stinker: 1. A confusing story line. It's supposed to be about a murdered women, the Black Dahlia, but there are so many confusing, unnecessary sub-plots going on, they forgot about the subject of the movie. 2. Bad writing. The dialogue was so bad it seemed like a parody of movies from the 1940's, with the corny dialogue, only exaggerated. It's as though Saturday Night Live wrote the script for a 10-minute skit, but stretched it into 2 hours. You can't believe how bad it is. 3. Wooden acting. I guess if you have a terrible script, even the best actors can't do much with it. Most of the actors try to copy the style of dialogue from the 1940s, which would be fine if we were in the 1940s, but this is 2006. There was one scene with a woman which was supposed to be serious, but it was so pathetically over-acted that people in the audience started laughing. Ouch! Save your money.",The Black Dahlia

What I got was a fictionalized overture of DePalma rehashed shots and scenes. It was basically ""The Untouchables"" with better picture quality. The trailer (which I saw many times) sets up a very slow paced drama with twists and turns that slowly expose what happened (or could have happened) to the Black Dahlia. Going in, I expected (that with a title like ""The Black Dahlia"" ) that it would be (completely) about Elizabeth Short and the events surrounding her murder. Maybe a more appropriate title for this picture would have been ""Fire & Ice"" because it was more about the cops than the murder. It's basically my own fault for not researching the movie before I went to see it. I have recently found that they chose to use the book (The Black Dahlia) which is a fictionalized (completely made-up) story about 2 cops, set around the Black Dahlia murder. Now that I know it was based on the book what do I think of the picture? Still mediocre, ""been done"" film making. It took basically 90 minutes of rummaging through the (fictionalized and pointless) cop story lines, before we finally got into the Black Dahlia murder. I could sense the audience being impatient through those 90 minutes, as if to say ""I don't care about these idiots, what happened to the girl!"" My suggestion: if you're gonna base a movie around a real event and market it as ""based on the most notorious murder, blah blah"", then maybe you should make sure we get 120 minutes of that event, and nothing else.",The Black Dahlia
439,T-Rex-2001,An achievement in dullness,1,26 February 2007,"Although this movie is advertised as a thriller, it most definitely IS NOT a thriller. It is NOT a detective story, NOT a horror film. It is instead a romantic melodrama about two cops and the girl they both, if not love, at least are buddy-buddy with. The only scary moment occurs about an hour in when you look at your watch and realize the film is only half over.I went in thinking this was a detective story and a horror thriller and was quite disappointed. I could have been satisfied with a good romantic melodrama, but even that doesn't come off.The movie starts off with boring exposition, then slowly descends into a bottomless abyss of tedium. Oh yes, the infamous murder of the Black Dahlia occurs, well into the film, but it's as drained of suspense and mystery as the Dahlia's corpse was drained of blood.What seems to have gone wrong is that the filmmakers became so intoxicated with the superficial embellishments of hard-boiled detective fiction and 1940s-Hollywood glamor that they lost sight of the characters and the story. The dialog is rapid-fire and filled with lines like ""she was hotter than the atom bomb"" and ""Great, now we got the entire armed services as a suspect."" As hyper as the dialog is, the visuals are soporifically slow and excessively stylized. Nothing looks real, especially the actors' performances. Near wall-to-wall music also sabotages any sense of realness. There is even an autopsy scene staged almost like a musical number, with the medical examiner sounding like Zero Mostel when he says something to the effect, ""Her intestines were removed all the way up to the um-BIL-icus."" The end result resembles a bad Broadway musical with an autopsy in it.One feels compelled at this point to mention that some of the people involved in the movie, like director Brian De Palma, have actually made good films (""Sisters,"" ""Carrie,"" ""The Fury""). That is, before one is compelled to warn other thriller-lovers to stay away from this movie. Don't order it on pay-per-view, as I did. Don't buy it on DVD.

442,mijuelborga,A comparison to the James Ellroy novel and why De Palma's version failed,1,29 September 2011,"I'd hate to be the first person to say this because it makes me sound like a snob, but it has to be said: the book was better. I believe everyone will be entitled to their own interpretations, just as Ellroy had been to an unsolved Dahlia murder that inspired his fictional novel (after all, it IS unsolved), but when you attempt to make a film based on a fictional book that was based on true-to-life incidents, you better stay true to the book or at least make sure your interpretation is half as interesting as the original. I have read most of the reviews and most seem unaware that there HAD been a book version. If they had, they were unsure whether Ellroy or DePalma was to blame for such an awful movie. Let me assure you that DePalma is the culprit and I am baffled as to why Ellroy would even approve of his version.I have quite a few problems with DePalma's film version and I will list them out here. 1.) DePalma leaves out important parts that made the book interesting to compromise for his own version's ending. In the book version, the story focused on three important aspects: the Dahlia murder, Bucky's love-triangle, and Dirty Police Politics. DePalma leaves out Police Politics entirely, shows little interest in the Dahlia murder and instead focuses more on Bucky's love-triangle (which, in my opinion, was underdeveloped as it is). Entire characters and intentions are left to explain themselves to the audience. (If you didn't get the film, it wasn't because the film was too noir or ""intellectual"", but sadly because it lacked a good story.) The Dahlia murder and love triangle just wasn't enough to support the character development. DePalma sacrificing story, intention and dialogue for the sake of a few good artsy shots is not a valid excuse and this is why he fails.2.) The entire movie felt rushed, perhaps simply because a 325-page murder-detective story will not be able to fit two hours worth of screen time? Nah. It's been done before so it is not a valid excuse. The first half of the movie was a nice, comfortable build-up but the second half felt so rushed and compromised it felt as if the movie was actually making-up for lost time. The absolute worst part of the film was in one of the last scenes where Bucky confronts Madelaine and Emmett wherein the story just kept spoon-feeding the audience explanation after explanation, not leaving any room at all for the audience (not to mention, Bucky) to process the information. It almost felt desperate on DePalma's part and has led me to theorize that somewhere along the making of this movie, he simply gave up, and this is why he fails.3.) Bad acting. Okay, I understand that the acting was supposed to be over-exaggerated and stylized to sort of create that old Hollywood-mood, but seriously what is up with Aaron Eckhart? It felt like I was watching a comedy. Josh Hartnett was okay, but I felt that some really important scenes that really could've highlighted Hartnett's acting were left out in the movie. He felt more obsessed with Madelaine when he should've been obsessing about Short. This created the impression of a love-story more than it did the impression of a cop taking over his dead partner's madness (which is what it actually was). The transition of Bucky's feelings towards the Dahlia from apathy to complete obsession and madness was completely lost in the film, when it could've been one of its most redeeming factors. Another fail was Hillary Swank's Madelaine. In the book, Madelaine was perceived as sort of shy and unsure, which created a nice film-noir ""twist"" at the end. The Madelaine femme fatale film-version felt cheap and recycled and lacked caution. Surprisingly, the only good piece of acting in the movie was done by Mia Kirshner in the role of Elizabeth Short. I have seen a few reviews that state otherwise but I guess it is safe to assume that they have not read the book. Mia Kirshner played the perfect Elizabeth Short - a face with a secret; long and empty stares; desperation in her eyes; a bit of naughtiness with just a hint of naivety. If the story had focused more on Elizabeth and why she felt compelled to do those things, it would've created curiosity. Instead we are left with a shadow that couldn't attract empathy from the audience.4.) Leaving out key characters that could've made the entire story more colorful and memorable. Characters such as the Vogel father-and-son duo, Dulange the Frenchman, Tommy Gilfoyle, Martha Sprague's confession, etc. All these characters could've saved the movie because they all were such memorable characters in the book version, and sometimes one memorable character is all you need. Sadly, in the DePalma version, none of the characters were memorable, even our very own lead Bucky was quite forgettable.All in all, I think De Palma could've faired better if he just created his very own interpretation of the Dahlia murders instead of desperately trying to re-interpret the Ellroy novel in a half-assed fashion. Personally, I would like to see another re-make of this movie. Perhaps get Frank Miller to handle the project, or better yet, do an entire HBO series because god-knows this story needs more than two hours of screen time. (and it IS a good novel, that was just handled wrongly by self-important film-making) I also personally would've liked to have seen as much gore and sex as there is intelligent dialog in the book; again, HBO would sound perfect for this. The good news is, watching the film will not entirely ruin the book-reading experience, I assure you. Having said that, I would like to encourage the people who hated the film to pick up the novel by Ellroy. I promise you, you will not be disappointed.",The Black Dahlia

The acting is sub par (particularly Scarlett Johansson, whose character is plain annoying) and the overall feel of the film has an air of incredulity about it (particularly when compared to the far superior LA Confidential).With the current drought of good movies, the critics will give this good reviews and the punters will flock to see it. But, will this film be in the top 100 films in 10 years time? I personally doubt it.The fact that this is based on a James Ellroy book, this film should have been so much better. Is it a coincidence that Brian De Palma shot this film. He has done some great films (Body Double, Scarface, Carlito's Way, Mission Impossible, Snake Eyes...OK, OK, I am joking about the last two), but therein lies the rub. De Palma is good at doing a certain genre of film but the tone of Black Dahlia is all wrong. It feels and looks like a 2nd rate TV movie.

A plot that is outrageous at best, needless convoluted and insipid at worst, acting that is either just plain dull or so over the top, I wonder if all of the crew were hyped on coke not to notice. Fiona Shaw is the worst perpetrator of them all with his two ridiculous scenes. She is usually at least decent but here she acts like a dog in heat. Hillary Swank isn't much better and she is horribly miscast as a seductress but I don't know if that is the worst casting decision they've taken in this movie since Scarlet Johansson is supposed to be a history major. I wonder if someone pulled a prank on them or if perhaps it was just a printing error.Basically, the movie jumps from one scene to another in disjointed fashion, not paying any attention to the overall flow. There are two plots running side by side and knit together with the thinnest of threads and both have needless side tracks which just detract from the movie and should've been left on the cutting table.

Choppy editing, loose directing and a constipated plot characterize his train wreck. Suspense is eliminated altogether and the movie never stops being a bore. The characters and their lingo are ridiculous and inflated-it's a Hollywood fake fest. Hilary Swank as a seductress? She's only kidding herself. Scarlett Johanssen better start reevaluating her acting and her voice; and JoshHarnett should stick to movies that fit his age. You just can't take any of it seriously. Poor Elizabeth Short must be rolling in her grave. I counted about four stories in one, and there might have even been more that I just didn't bother following.

446,harry_johnstone7,Fails to Meet Potential,4,13 October 2014,"The Black Dahlia is an intellectual property with such raw possibility that has honestly been massacred by the poor direction of this film. It seemed somewhat rushed as though it was attempting to capitalise on some trending 1950's noir-esque theme. What was encapsulated quite well in this film was the nuances of the time period the film was recreating, however, I wish I could remark on more compelling positives but they were scarce indeed. There's such talent present in the cast but the plot seemingly lacks purpose and events that occur allow the audience to ask questions that are never followed with answers and not in the thrilling 'it's for the audience to draw their own conclusions' kind of way either. Honestly having Scarlett Johansson, Aaron Eckhart and to an extent Josh Hartnett and wasting their exceeding talent on a movie so poorly formulated is disgraceful. To those searching for a movie closely related but possessing a fictitious retelling of the original Black Dahlia case will be sorely disappointed as the lack of reality based conclusions the film draws leaves confusion as its greatest legacy. The relationships between the characters seem strained and portrayals too deliberate as the use of period based slang is used somewhat over-zealously shredding what relative credibility the story had left. The development of characters such as Lee (Eckhart) was disjointed and uninteresting but again I must emphasise the potential in his character as clichéd as the obsessive detective is it was so valid in this piece and yet so poorly executed as the confusion left by the conflicting subplots overshadows the importance of his role. The ending was neat enough and does a decent job of settling up the narrative of a film that from this small section seems entirely too long.

It goes on and on, with there being NO link in between the stories.There was far too many subplots and stories going on, and half of them had nothing to do with the plot. There was the story with Ms Kaye Lake, that was NOT an important part to the story. It seemed as though they just threw it in there.And we get to the dialogue, boy was that a disaster. How on earth did this film make it to theatres? How did people on set understand what the actors were saying? Half of the dialogue was mumbling.I was incredibly disappointed, I thought it had the potential to be a good film.I did like one part, however, the wardrobe was very well done.",The Black Dahlia

About an hour into it, I didn't know what this movie had to do with Betty Short at all! This movie had nothing to do with the Black Dahlia murder, except that these 2 young cops eventually investigate it, after having accidentally stumbling upon it. But it seemed to be more about the policemen and their 3-way relationship than to do with the murder.I was glad I got to see it for free, but I still feel cheated.

453,gordon12,The Black Dahlia: Elizabeth Short; cut again,6,20 September 2006,"I've been captivated by the Black Dahlia case because it happened in January, 1947, a time when my hormones were kicking in and my crushes tended to focus on dark-haired beauties like Linda Darnell and Gail Russell.The New York Daily News and the Mirror were quick to publish pictures and headlines about the pretty, raven-haired 22 year-old, whose bisected corpse was discovered in a lot outside Hollywood. The case had no serial killer draw, nor did it require any, the crime itself grotesque enough by itself. Her name was Elizabeth Short.The case had been addressed, obliquely, in ""True Confessions,"" a novel by James Gregory Dunne, published in 1972. A film of the same name, released in 1981, was both an excellent police procedural and a study of the shadier side of religio-politics, tracing the parallel careers of brothers, one a tainted cop, the other a wheeling and dealing monsignor. In that film, the victim, ""The Virgin Tramp,"" had nothing to do with Elizabeth Short, except for the method of her murder and the means of her disposal.When I heard that a film was being planned with Brian DiPalma directing, the news evoked a feeling of restrained enthusiasm. The first shoe dropped for me when I read that the screenplay was being based on James Ellroy's novel, The Black Dahlia. It had been several years since I'd read Ellroy's admitted page-turner; but the book was really about two Los Angeles cops, in the harsh, corrupt LAPD atmosphere of the 1940s. Beth Short was a supporting cast member. She deserved better; and she still does, so many years after her death.Despite all the ambient lawlessness, the film opens with a scheduled fight between former heavyweight Lee Blanchard, played by a tightly-wound Aaron Eckhart and former light-heavy Dwight ""Bucky"" Bleichert, hair parted in the middle and plastered down, like a prom night bandleader, portrayed by Josh Hartnett. The bout is to promote a proposition for a bond issue, which will cover an across the board pay hike for the LAPD. The high level infighting and the bloody, thudding bout consume nearly a half hour of the film. Blanchard and Bleichert are partners, and they form a trio with Blanchard's lover, Kaye Lake (Scarlett Johansson), whose major preoccupations are the tortured exercise of smoking cigarettes with a long holder and filling out soft white fluffy sweaters, a la Lana Turner.The two cops, partners known as Fire and Ice, are proccupied with an elderly white perp, his black lady fiend, and an obsese black pimp in part of town where gun shots are not unexpected; and while they're so engaged, we see a mother, deserting her carriage running and screaming for help because of the grim discovery she's made no so far away. Even here, Betty Short gets second billing in her own picture. When the investigation does focus on Beth Short it is usually through the steadying efforts Inspector Russ Millard (Mike Starr). Bleichert is much distracted and Blanchard becomes consumed, having apparently been emotionally overwhelmed by the filmed vulnerability of Beth Short (Mia Kirshner). Both are seemingly distracted by a soon-to-be released villain from Blanchard's past, days away from freedom.Kirshner is one of the better elements of the film, capturing the Massachusetts-born girl, in over her head in a futile search for stardom. Striving for stardom, she slides down the greased walls of flashy nightspots, where high rollers like Madeleine Linscott (Hilary Swank) go slumming for kicks. Linscott's parents, Emmett Linscott (John Kavanagh, looking Machiavellian) and Ramona (Fiona Shaw, a kinetic and spastic wreck) are properly neurotic, having their former dog now a stuffed tribute to Daddy's first million. Daddy's a transported Scot whose made his fortune in housing developments, hastily built with left-over studio throw aways.With Di Palma we always get striking images. Mark Isham can construct the perfect score for any genre. Vilmos Zsigmond's cinematography is gripping. Beth Short is dead. Her case is unsolved. She deserves better.",The Black Dahlia
454,pndfam05,Disappointing,3,15 September 2006,"I was expecting a story about a disturbing, unsolved murder. I wanted more detail about who Elizabeth Short was and what motivated her to move to Los Angeles (other than being start-struck).What I found, instead, was a blandly scripted movie that dragged and failed to entertain, move, or inform me. Elizabeth Short's death was the sensational centerpiece that attracted viewers attention but the story could have been about any 1947 Jane Doe.The film vacillated between Film Noir and a late 40's twisted love triangle drama. But in the end it was neither.Neither Josh Harnett nor Scarlett Johansson looked comfortable as film noir players. Hillary Swank was the highlight for me. Go, Hillary.And, it rained too much for Los Angeles.Forget it, Jake. It's no Chinatown. Probably not worth rushing to see.",The Black Dahlia
455,sutirted,Not much of a detective Story.,6,13 October 2006,"Detective Film? I have seen every Brian DePalma film I can get my hands on, and I have a theory. Since Bonfire Of the Vanities, every modern DePalma film can be closely tied to a DePalma film pre-Bonfire. Mission Impossible is a little bit of a standout from that theory. Th theory holds true for this film. The Black Dahlia is basically The Untouchables with a little but of Dressed To Kill and Sisters thrown in for good measure. This does not lessen my enjoyment of modern DePalma films at all. What did lessen my enjoyment of this film was its approach to a detective/mystery story. A good mystery story gives you blatant clues and tangents for you to follow in the back of your mind while the story unfolds on screen. With The Black Dahlia I felt as if I was being rewarded with solved pieces of the mystery, for having sat through a large chunk of the film. Every time my endurance and patience had been severely tested, I would be given another piece of the puzzle. These pieces of the puzzle had holes in them, but only for the most astute viewer to fill in. I had no distractions during the movie, but I was still lost a great deal of the time. Finally, puzzle pieces were given to me one after the other and the entire 90 minutes before was neatly and quickly explained in 10 minutes. The obligatory ode to Hitchcock was shown and the movie was over.I loved this movie.I just bashed it for a paragraph. Am I a split personality like in another DePalma film? On the contrary. I compare this film to the Howard Hawks' The Big Sleep. Gaping plot holes could not sink that movie because the characters and sets of the movie wholly enveloped and entertained me. I love James Ellroy's novels (he wrote the book upon which this film is based). I love Raymond Chandler's cityscapes and characters. I love film noir and hard boiled fiction. The characters and settings in this movie captivated me and made me not care what was happening in the story so much. I trusted them to let me live their lives with them (in much the same state of confusion) until their story was done. Next time I see this film I am sure that I will enjoy it even more because the plot will concern me even less. L.A. Confidential is another film (also from a book by James Ellroy) that I loved the characters in, and have revisited several more times to hang out with those characters again. Granted, a lot more happens in L.A. Confidential than in The Black Dahlia, but I think the characters are almost as interesting, if not just as interesting.For the armchair DePalma scholars like myself there is a wonderful crane shot ala Scarface, a great extended POV shot ala Snake Eyes, a great Hitchcock referencing moment ala everything in DePalma's cannon, sexual confusion ala most everything in the cannon, no split screen, but a lot of division of characters in the same frame by elements in the frame and a couple of shots that looked like old split-diopter set ups, but much cleaner.Maybe wait for this on DVD, but see it if you identify with anything I said.",The Black Dahlia
456,l-lipscombe,Overly complex...,4,18 September 2006,"I had expected this to be a real treat but ultimately was left disappointed and somewhat confused as were seemingly many of the other cinema goers. It's sometimes as though Directors make films needlessly complicated to give them a mystical or 'noir' feel which sometimes leads to cult status. This works supremely well in movies such as Memento, but for the most part just leads to incoherency and convolusion both of which are in abundance in this movie. I gave up trying to humour the plot after around 30 minutes in the belief that everything would become clear, but after a further 90 minutes, I only grew more confused.",The Black Dahlia
457,andrewschrock,"confusing, but not for intended reasons",2,18 September 2006,"I know what you're thinking: ""Hilary Swank, Aaron Eckhart, and Scarlet Johansson.. can't be too bad,"" right? Unfortunately, despite its pedigree, it's really bad. So bad that it's difficult to comprehend. Bafflingly bad.It's not a good film noir. The script is piecemeal and the pieces of the plot just don't fit together. For one, thing the entire movie is not about the black dahlia murder. For another, peoples actions aren't so much shrouded and mysterious as random and confusing. Throughout you can't shake the feeling you're watching a movie that was written as some kind of stream of consciousness experiment, wrapping a script around a couple half-baked ideas.Film noir deals in clichés, but here statements meant to be poignant come off as laughable. The movie is cheesy to the extreme, and through a combination bad editing and a poorly written script, crosses a line where the plot just does not make sense any more. The intended revelation at the end of the movie would be better suited to an episode of law & order.In short, save your money, unless you're looking for a way to vet your movie dates to see if they have any taste.",The Black Dahlia
458,LimeyDave,Messy and confusing,3,8 July 2007,"First let's start this with a truth. The film the Black Dahlia is not really about the infamous Hollywood murder of Betty Short perpetrated in the middle of the twentieth century; it's really the story of two detectives, 'Bucky' Bleichert, (played by a stiff jawed Josh Harnett) and Lee Blanchard, (played by a miscast Aaron Eckhart) who become obsessed with the case. The Black Dahlia murder case serves, therefore, as a backdrop to the story of this obsession, and OK nothing wrong with that. The case remains unsolved, so I was not expecting some great revelation, of this decades old ""whodunnit"". But given the pedigree of the film, (De Palma directing, based on a James Ellroy novel, (he wrote the excellent LA Confidential)), I was expecting a well crafted plot driven story that would keep my attention. Alas, this was not to be. The film opens during the ""zoot"" suite riots in LA, and then moves to a boxing match between staged between Harnett and Eckhart, given to invigorate a failing proposition that is before LA voters to increase police pay. Throw into the mix Eckhart's love interest, (Scarlett Johansson), is also now becoming the love interest of Hartnett, and was the former love interest of a dangerous convict she and Eckhart helped convict, and wouldn't you just know it is due out of prison in the next few days. The investigation of a pedophile, and some mob investigation thing that ends in a shoot out, and  well fifty minutes have passed in the movie, and no sign of the case that is to obsess our two detectives in sight. The problem is that what takes place in this first fifty minutes is either largely redundant, (the boxing match, the pedophile sub plot which ends up going nowhere), or could have been established in five or ten minutes of well crafted story telling. It is just after the mob shoot out thing . whatever that was supposed to be, (it raises it's head later and is apparently integral to the plot, but by that point I had taken to counting dog hairs in a square inch of carpet, and calculating the result for the whole room in my head,) that finally the bisected body of the once aspiring actress is found. Eckhart's character now turns into a loony tune, demonstrated by him throwing photographs of Elizabeth Short around the room and banging doors, Harnett manages to grimace and look like a whipped puppy all at the same time, and Johansson's character looks like she wants to get laid by somebody, anybody, please! Enter now a weird and messed up family of characters, lead by the usually wonderful Hillary Swank. Swank we are lead to believe is a dead ringer for the unfortunate Betty Short, (ok, she is female, has dark hair, and I'm guessing if I was blind drunk looking at her from some curious angle I could see the resemblance). And it is she, (I think, my confusion at this point was great, and the calculation of dog hairs per square inch far too interesting), that leads to Harnett becoming obsessed with the case. The last hour of the film stumbles along, as did the first hour, trying to conclude some disinteresting sub-plots, many of which are never really satisfyingly concluded, and grinds, (oh how it grinds), to it's conclusion, and the twist of ""whodunit"" which is obvious just after the weird family are introduced. Ooops did I just give it away, well I guess I've saved you from wasting two hours of your life, you should thank me. And the answer to the dog hairs per square inch question? Its time to buy a new vacuum cleaner.",The Black Dahlia

Over the top acting, cheesy dialogue, sudden awkward ending followed by, ""THE END"", recapping of past events near the end of the film (sure it leaves the plot line a bit muddy but thats NOIR!

461,paharan,A Halfway House,6,20 December 2006,"I have read the book and seen the movie version of the Black Dahlia. The book was very good mainly because it focused in on it's two main characters Bleichart and Blanchard's reaction to the murder of Elizabath Short. The case in the book takes second place as it is more a story of character than plot. However the films main problem was that it was not sure exactly what it was trying to be. I felt it could either be a translation of the book where the character's motivations and analysis are it explored. But this was only hinted at leaving you unsure why the characters got so emotionally involved. The other way of filming this, and one which i would have preferred, would have been to take out all the character backstories and motivations and just focus on the crime. For a film adaptation this would have been a much better thing as in a book you are able to spend time developing back stories and motivations. You can't do that in a movie. This meant that the film got lost in it's own complexity. It could have been simplified and made more enjoyable. If you read LA Confidential that also has wide character development and back stories. It was simplified for the movie and worked superbly. So in conclusion this film was trying to be both a character based and plot based piece and got lost in it's own indecision of direction.",The Black Dahlia
462,wvillage10,Funniest Line,2,17 September 2006,"SHE LOOKS JUST LIKE THE DEAD GIRL, YOUR THE SICK ONE-- has got to be the funniest line that was not intended to be funny in the whole movie- I laughed, along with the rest of the theater, for about 2 minutes after that-- and then when the Voice Over comes on and its SCARElett's voice repeating it again, I just could not contain my laughter anymore! Go see it just for that alone! The movie is not great at all- it tries to come across as all serious and drama filled but comes off as a bad Saturday Night Live sketch! Apparently, Josh Hartnett thinks all it takes is a furrowed look with his eyebrows to demonstrate any of his emotions. They should have gotten an actor who is older then Josh- he did not fit the bill as a detective-- he looks too much like 2006, then a character from 1940's. The best acting was done my Mia, who played the Black Dahlia-- she gave a great performance in a limited role. Hillary Swank came off as a bad drag queen impersonator while we find out too late why Aaron Eckhardt's character is in such turmoil over the death of the Black Dahlia. When we do find out the truth, we don't care anymore. Too much happens at the end and it was like a student cramming for a midterm 5 minutes before the test begins. So much is thrown at us in the last 5 minutes of the movie- characters, motives, red herrings, misunderstandings, that I needed a score card to keep track of who was with who and who knew what with who. Its a movie you should rent-- only so u can pause and rewind to understand what was thrown at you in the last few minutes of the movie. It was like the director thought the movie was too long so he just threw everything in at once to tie up loose ends, when all it does is create more questions then answers. Scarlette apparently thinks by smoking a long cigarette and pouting she is transformed to the 1940's but in every movie why does she come across as bored and dull. Will the Black Dahila murder be solved, will the good guys prevail, will Josh Hartnett learn to act, will the scenery hold up after Aaron Echardt's chews threw the movie- acting docile one moment, then out of control in the next-- find out when you see the Black Dahlia.... on video of course, after your friend buys it.",The Black Dahlia

There are still parts that I can't understand or don't see the significance. The film did not GO anywhere up until the very end, and even the dramatic parts weren't very exciting.

465,d_may-1,it's hardly Ed Wood......,6,1 October 2006,"It's been interesting reading all the vitriol heaped on this movie, most of it misinformed and misguided. ""The Black Dahlia"" isn't ""Skidoo"" or ""Myra Breckenridge"" or even ""Showgirls."" Yes, the screenplay is a muddle. Yes, the last 30 minutes have the feeling of a hectic chase through previously unresolved plot elements. But there are many wonderful things on display here: DePalma's mature camera technique, the wonderful evocation of 40's LA, the dialogue (most of it lifted directly from Ellroy's novel), and very good performances from Josh Hartnett and Hillary Swank.Yes, Hillary Swank, she of the migrating accent. Anyone with even a nodding familiarity with the book should realize that Madeleine's character lacks an inner life, that her character is nothing but masks and borrowed identities, either her father's or the Black Dahlia's. And Hillary Swank, in my opinion, did a good job of capturing this essential instability and inconsistency of character. As for Josh Hartnett, I liked his low-key take on a typical noir stereotype. Many cineastes will always associate this character with world-weariness, and indeed Hartnett isn't Bogart or Tom Neal, and never will be. But he does manage to convey some of the character's mixture of misplaced idealism and cynicism in an economical way, and, except for a few garbled lines, gives a commendable performance.Ellroy's novel was probably the wrong vehicle for an exploration of the enduring Black Dahlia mystery. Although a great work of fiction, it is in fact so ambitious in its treatment of ""big"" themesthe loss of innocence, America's fascination with violence, the corruption of authoritythat four hours of screen time might have been barely adequate to do justice to its many sub-plots. As it was, some of the book's most memorable episodeschiefly, the lengthy episode in Tijuana, and Vogel's torturing of several Black Dahlia confessorswent completely away. The theme of police corruption, other than what was touched on through Blanchard's connection with the Boulevard-Citizen's bank robbery, was entirely neglected in favor of the ménage a trois. And the way the separate plot elements of Bobby DeWitt + Madeleine and Georgie Tilden were forcibly conflated in the scene where Blanchard is murdered left many scratching their heads.In addition, DePalma never clearly established whether he was doing a film noir or film noir parody. The final scene with Fiona Shaw became a monotone confession in the novel, and was all the more chilling because of it. Turning the dramatic high point of the film into a hilarious piece of camp might have worked in a David Lynch or Guy Madden film, but it certainly doesn't work here.One can only hope that Elizabeth Short will someday get her day in courtif not the jurisprudence variety, then perhaps the cinematic. Certainly, a great film could be made on this subject, which will remain iconic a hundred years from now. And if anyone is bold enough to tackle Betty Short after DePalma's sincere but flawed effort, I hope that s/he addresses the two main questions remaining unsolved after all these years: (1) who was the ""unID'd man"" in the photos with Beth Short, whose identity has gone officially unsolved for 60 years, and (2) who was the former mental patient sought by the FBI, whose name has been sedulously blacked out in the de-classified FBI files?",The Black Dahlia
466,irritable27,"A big sordid ""So what?""",1,5 March 2007,"No idea what the point of this film is--I can surmise as to what is supposed to be...but what it became is truly an incoherent, sordid, boring mess.The murder is treated like an afterthought--as an excuse to bore us with the ethical and romantic conflicts experienced by a couple of tedious male cops who box and love the same woman or whatever(I usually like Aaron Eckhardt too--but here his character made v. little sense).Also, Josh's character is all (paraphrased): the truth doesn't stay buried forever...Well, as far as anyone knows the murder, in real life, is STILL a bloody mystery, the truth buried yet...so to speak. There is rampant speculation and theorizing (the most recent being by the son of a doctor who claims his father/the doctor did it, rather compellingly). But it is still unsolved. The fictional premise in this film proves ludicrous even without reality--the mother? huh..? and, um, so what? who is this person? why her? she is a character we have barely seen with an utterly contrived reason involving an even more unknown character (the conveniently absent/dead old business partner? creepy disfigured gardener? father of Madeline? WHATEVER) as the solution.In any event, the movie utterly--and ridiculously--misrepresents the murder. Fine and dandy, but rather unfair to the real victim...and the real murderer of course. An attempt to include some of the going theories would have been more effective.As someone else here noted, the murder itself is not even alluded to until well into the story. So irritating. The title is a misdirection.Confusing plotting and a baroque irrelevant framing narrative do not a real mystery make (unless the mystery is ""where's the black dahlia? isn't this movie about her? why did I pay to watch Hartnett's wooden acting?)Finally, the surrounding, ridiculously chaotic and pointless plot was a pathetic, SNL-ish parody of the amazing classic _Chinatown_, a great movie that does not deserve to placed anywhere near this film in terms of genre.So...see Chinatown for what this kind of movie really should have been! Also, in terms of recent films dealing with similar material: _Hollywoodland_. While imperfect in places, it makes a lot more sense and the character's motivations are both more complex and much clearer--and it was really quite enjoyable to watch.",The Black Dahlia

Oh and guess what people... If your actually wanting to see a film about the Black Dahlia murder you might want to wait until one actually comes out. The whole story line is basically focused on the two ""fictional"" detectives that were assigned the case in the film. The Dahlia is just a back story. Yeah, I was very irritated! Almost everything was fictional in fact, with very few factual details.It dragged like a critically wounded cow. The sighs and mumblings of discontent from the audience was the norm throughout the whole 2 long, long, long, very very long, long, hours the picture ran. Actually.. one other spectator stated with exhaustion when the light came up, ""That was 60 minutes longer that is Should have been"". Another movie goer outside of the show rooms actually began to chant in front of the ticket windows, ""Dont see Black Dahlia""! I couldn't agree more I'm afraid.As far as the performances go, Bravo & they did a damn good job with what they had. You won't be disappointed by any one actor here.

469,brettleitner,"Criminally underrated, THE BLACK DAHLIA shines",10,19 September 2006,"The work of a true artist, Brian De Palma's THE BLACK DAHLIA is a terrific cinematic achievement that unfortunately won't be appreciated in its time. A brief scan of the user comments here reveal proclamations such as ""The worst film ever made"" and so forth. Clearly DePalma has pushed a button in audiences and defied their expectations, challenging them to think, look closely and prepare for the unexpected. It's too bad that audiences prefer their murder mysteries served straight up, CSI-style. They've missed out on a thrilling and insightful journey. To those naysayers out there, take a second look at THE BLACK DAHLIA and you might actually find it illuminating. DePalma has packed so much in this 2 hour masterwork that repeat viewings are bound to prove rewarding, and might possibly even change a few minds.DePalma applies many straightforward film noir conventions within the framework of his darkly comedic, socially and morally conscious sensibility. His playfulness with the genre is likely what angers so many people, but for those open to a different approach, what a journey he takes you on! Many of De Palma's signature techniques are on full display in THE BLACK DAHLIA and are used to great effect, including his roaming camera, slow motion action, POV angles and rapid fire edits. As usual, many find these techniques just for show, but they add weight to the film, both visually and thematically. De Palma's favorite themes are woven throughout, including corruption, voyeurism, doubles and not trusting what you see. They combine to tell a riveting tale of moral degradation in Hollywood, both within the movies (The ""Black Dahlia"" character, played wonderfully by Mia Kirschner) and outside of it (Josh Hartnett, very strong in the lead and his best performance to date). While the narrative complications may annoy some, I personally enjoyed the ride of navigating through all the plot's challenges. I certainly didn't find it incomprehensible, and I'm a bit puzzled by that common response. And focusing too intently on the 'whos' and 'whats' distracts from the IDEAS that DePalma raises, such as the moral compromise and sexual potency of his characters.The leads are uniformly well-suited to their roles, filling in their archetypical characters with color and nuance. While Fiona Shaw's performance has been a bit of a contentious point for some, to not appreciate her delicious turn as the snobbish, sodden and soused matriarch would be to miss out on one of the film's delightful pleasures. I also loved Mark Isham's striking and atmospheric score, as well as the lush cinematography, sets and costumes.While I can accommodate that some of the characters, humor and plot threads might not resonate with some audiences, I cannot comprehend why audiences loathe this film so much. With so many unchallenging and creatively bankrupt movies filling our theatres, dismissing THE BLACK DAHLIA outright is a disgrace. But why should this De Palma film be different from all others? SCARFACE was detested back in 1983 and is now considered a universal classic. For those who do appreciate THE BLACK DAHLIA today, it's a shining example of movie-making at its most thrilling.",The Black Dahlia

Hence the stiff acting, the background voice, the pace. The result is a total fiasco. The most improbable and uselessly twisted plot - and most conventional where the rich are perverse and the women are wanton. I could not find a single minute of enjoyment or interest. Never, was there a moment when the action was capturing and dragging into the story. The characters have no credible human depth. The twists and surprises in the plot are so many, that you would need a handbook to guide you through them - and a heavy dose of alcohol, not to think that this is an over-the-top most incredible mish-mash. Worst movie I have seen in 10 years.",The Black Dahlia

The rest of more than two hours finds Josh Hartnett staring at clown paintings and tossing baked chickens aside to seduce one woman or another while Aaron Eckhart chews scenery in a performance about as subtle and nuanced as Godzilla. Clichés abound: Drunken, innately evil California old-money baddies, tuxedo-clad lesbians, crusty and hard-bitten but benign cops.

Before I went to watch it I checked the rating on IMDb and it was 7.3 so i figured it was worth watching. But boy was I angry during the movie. The movie is too long and it seems as it is pushed the length for no apparent reason. I also kept losing interest in the movie because so many different things keep happening and there is not 1 main even that the movie focuses on. It is by far the worst movie I have ever seen and I am not joking. I also went with a group of 3 and we all felt the same. It seemed a bit like a porno due to the excessive showing of nudity.

474,ValkyrieRaven88,Where is the Dahlia in this mess?,2,9 April 2007,"I'm sad to say that this movie turned out to be terrible. I had wanted to see it very badly. The fact that everyone who I told I was renting it said not to waste my money should have given me a clue.The movie had almost nothing to do with the Black Dahlia. It focused on two cops who were also boxers and were apparently in love with the same girl, who used to be a prostitute. I could hardly concentrate due to the plot being so boring. I kept waiting for them to shift the focus on the murder, because you'd think a movie titled ""The Black Dahlia"" would be about the murder. It was only a tiny subplot in the movie.When they did get to the murder, they couldn't keep their facts straight. Elizabeth Short had never managed to get anywhere in Hollywood, yet they had her participating in a porn movie and doing screen tests. They didn't capture the brutality of the murder well enough. It wasn't even mentioned that she was completely cut in half through the abdomen. As far as I know, she had nothing to do with any lesbian nightclubs--a lead obviously put in to attract horny college students to the movie for a couple seconds of girl-on-girl action.Josh Hartnett just got on my nerves in this movie. He, like every other actor in it, was horribly miscast. His character's actions made absolutely no sense and I got tired very quickly on the movie's focus on his love life. You can only watch him tear someone's clothes off so many times before it gets really, really old.The rich family featured as suspects in the murder also irritated me. The mother is just crazy, and if I were a cop, I'd have arrested her on the spot. You could tell right away they had something to do with it, especially since the girl's story kept changing, but not ""supercop."" He'd rather sleep with her and keep her name out of the papers. The mother's reasoning for what she did to the Dahlia made no sense, and the actress was terrible with a capital T. It just didn't say delusional psychopath like it should have.I was also disappointed that they barely even showed the body of the Dahlia. It's rated R partly for grisly images, according to the back of the box, but we don't see any of them. One of the most fascinating things about the case is how the girl was mutilated. I've seen the crime scene photos. The movie avoided showing even just the facial mutilation for more than a second. It was almost like subliminal messaging--you just don't get a clear enough look at it.I was expecting to see the detectives work hard to solve the Dahlia's murder but they seemed more interested in moping about their personal problems than in interviewing the fifty-something people confessing to the murder. This was just a stupid, stupid movie. I'm giving it a two out of ten only because I liked some of the imagery in the film.",The Black Dahlia

Add to this rather insane omission (one does suppose, at the very least, that the title of a film does include some mention and spotlight on the title character, but not in this case!) De Palma so intent on his BS camera angles and trying-for-mood-sepia-tints has perpetrated on the movie-going public what can only be described as an insult. People are interested in the Dahlia, and want to know more about Elizabeth Short's (remember her? the TITLE character????) background and how she turned herself into this exotic creature from her straight-laced upbringing in Hyde Park Mass. What did she do in Hollywood? Who did she hang out with? Who was the rich society deb who was found murdered in her bathtub and was one of Dahlia's buddies? What did Dahlia do the last few days of her life? How did she meet such a horrific end? So what does De Palma and Ellroy (who should know better) focus on? Two cardboard and BORING cops and the ubiquitous Girlfriend. The one single fleeting moment of interest was k.d. Lang crooning in a lesbian club. The cops were dreadful, no acting skills whatsoever and no charisma...esp the so-called lead, whose face is as exciting and memorable as vanilla pudding. I sat watching this piece of garbage for the entire agonizing minutes it lasted with the same horrified fascination one would have watching a slo-mo car wreck...you know it's happening and that you are powerless to stop it. I really did, up to the end, expect it to improve, but alas, t'was a hope in vain. It only got worse, if that is possible, with each frame and what a waste of good film and waste of the public's time viewing this bomb. I still cannot figure out what happened to the two most responsible for this disaster, DePalma and Ellroy; did they actually think they could produce some lame razzle dazzle Noir wannabe superficial looks with no substance at all? Did they not think, even once, that people who paid to see this dreck and buy it on DVD would forgive them for not focusing on the TITLE character? Who CARES about the idiot cops and their sordid, boring lives???? The title should haver been 2 Cops and their Girlfriend and leave the Dahlia out, just as they did in this piece of crap. Gentlemen, please, do us and yourselves a favor and never do a film again that uses false advertising...you used the name of the Dahlia with zero content and no conscience for the audience who has an interest in this, the most famous unsolved crime in the USA. Shame on both of you.",The Black Dahlia
476,cgrahamt,A badly written convoluted mess to be avoided,2,19 September 2006,"This movie is an incredibly badly written, convoluted mess. It ""jumped the shark"" so many times that a viewer might be excused for thinking they'd stumbled into ""Jaws 4""! It was far too long, the plot spiraled out of control and several performances, especially Fiona Shaw and Aaron Eckhart, were way over the top. Hilary Swank, Scarlett Johansson and Josh Hartnett did admirable jobs of selling the weak dialog that eventually buried their characters. A huge disappointment for a De Palma film. He may have been going for a noir look, but a lot of what hit the screen looked fake or CG rather than moody. Some viewers have suggested this film may have been an attempt at either an homage to, or tongue-in-cheek take on, the noir genre and/or 40s L. A. detective movies rather than a straight up serving of those. Whatever it was trying to be, it failed miserably.

Considering the fact that the fictional account of ""The Black Dahlia"" by James Ellroy was what the movie was supposed to be about, this chopped up version of the story was unrecognizable. I sat there listening to my boyfriend laugh and snicker at the scenes that were supposed to have some romantic value. That scene with the stuffed turkey on the dining room table was totally comic! The connections between the detectives was never clear. Needeless to say, people who have read anything about the Black Dahlia that isn't fictional will find this movie a mockery at best and more hideous than the actual murder. Not even worth the money for a DVD rental and I feel sorry for the actresses and actors that were cast in this fiasco. I think Brian De Palma would of done better if he had made a historical movie based on the real known facts of the Black Dahlia case, instead of waiting years and years after James Ellroy's fictional depiction of the murder came out and then making a movie based on it.

480,gellis79,A unfortunate time spent at the Cinema,3,23 September 2006,"My main hope for this film before I went to see it was, 'I hope this is going to be a good whodunit' as by all means the trailer seems to set it up with its beautiful leading ladies, and intriguing serial killer sequel murder plot. But from the start you are plunged into a world which sets up a reality that is got its foot in it mouth rather than having its tongue in its cheek, neither wholly real or fake. With so much attention to the costume and the sets that the actors seem to be swimming in a foreign ocean not really knowing what to do or say convincingly. Scarlett for instance trying to look like she has been smoking for years using a holder is just painful.The script tries to emulate that from the film noir thrillers of the 50s but gets confused mid sentence, and the fact that its either spoken to quickly or quietly means that it comes off making no sense at all. Confusing a already jumbled and convoluted plot further. And the acting especially by Ekhart deserves a 'Oscar' for best posturing, and weird face making.At times it looks great but there is no sense of direction from Palma, using to same split focus shot over 5 times making it all together rather tedious to watch.

Ramona dies from lupus in the novel, rather than blowing her brains out. and i didn't like all the screen tests they showed of Elizabeth. that didn't happen in the novel and it portrayed her completely different than the picture i had of her in my head. i also thought the actors didn't act ""40's"" enough. they talked just the way they would in 2006 and I'm pretty sure people used different slang and spoke differently in the forties. i liked how in the book time passes two years after the dahlia's death and they don't find the shack where she is killed until '49 when the ""Hollywoodland"" sign is being taken down. i was really disappointed in the movie.

The plot veered off in a few separate directions, and felt as though it was chopped up into little pieces then strung back together, hopefully making sense--which none of it did. There were many filler scenes that were not only unnecessary but unintelligent. The acting and musical score were cheesy, and the movie became so ridiculous at points I laughed.

489,stips-1,Probably quite enjoyable.,5,22 October 2006,"If you want a story about the murder of Elizabeth Short don't watch this film. If you want a amusing (not sure if it was meant to be) film that has some good scenes, nice visuals, but no real coherent plot, then this is the one for you. Also, if you have a peeve about bad scripting or cheesy lines, don't watch this film.The plot in this film is almost understandable.At times the movie moves at a really chaotic and internally inconsistent pace. It's very much like the screenwriter decided that there where twists that had to be included in the film from the book, but ended up with enough time to include them, make a token at resolving them, and move to the next one. So we get bombarded with the plot in a basically nonsensical manner with things being revealed and resolved quickly in flash-backs or some dialog. Also the first half of the movie is unconnected from, and is paced and delivered differently from the second half of the movie. There is a real feeling of director/producer rushing things along at the end. The acting in the film is decent from most of the actors. The only good performance given is by Aaron Eckhart playing Lee Blanchard, one of two of the policeman the story follows. There are also some decent performances from some of minor characters in the film, but the other major players are noticeably wooden in parts. Over all fairly average acting.One of the most noticeable things in this film is that Josh Hartnett giving a film noir narrative over some parts of the movie. Now aside from Josh not really having the voice to pull it off, the narrative was incredibly cheesy in parts seemingly more suitable for something like ""Max Pain"". This is not helped by the fact that this style is not internally consistent throughout the film either.This is a film that can probably be bagged for its deficiencies for hours so I'll point out what I thought where the few good points to this film.... Anyone familiar with Ellroy will notice some characters and the nods towards those characters they got in this. As earlier said the acting of Aaron Eckhart is worth watching. There are some genuinely creeping and some amusing scenes. The camera work is very good in places. The visuals in the film are very nice. Maybe the directors cut will make sense. And as a period piece it does decently.Overall, it's not as bad as a lot of films and is probably quite enjoyable if you're not expecting much.

490,naomihira,Wow what a horrible movie,2,15 September 2006,"I guess it is ignorant to go into a film so notably titled ""The Black Dahlia"", and actually assume it will adhere to its naming. DePalma's latest film, although running thick with big name actors and big budgets, fails miserably.To begin with there is enough movie making magic in the actual case of Elizabeth Scott (code name The Black Dahlia) that it is a mockery of the tragedy (and the victim) to even pretend that this film operates off of the notorious mystery that haunted southern California in the late 40's. With all the amusement park like shooting scenes, fuzzy lighting, long cigarettes, and gross amounts of over dramatization, the audience can't even remember what the movie was supposed to be about.Very basic points of movie making have been completely neglected here. Maybe too much concentration was placed on making sure the old Hollywood glamour lighting was as authentic as can be. However, imperative things, say like the plot of a movie were jeopardized on its behalf. The beginning of the movie kicks off (and lingers) with a boxing battle between the two male leads, leaving you wondering if you mistakenly bought tickets to see Cinderella Man II. At last the audience is spared from the boxing drama, but have no fear, irrelevant and awkwardly placed scenes don't stop there. There's of course police corruption plots that are too confusing to follow you don't even care when they are uncovered. Hilary Swanks questionable relationship with her father. And let's not forget her mother whose character would seem more at home starring in a Halloween special on Nickelodeon.With overacting, over lighting, and little to none plot continuity, this is the film where you wonder what time it is, what plans you have tomorrow, and when oh when will the ending credits roll.",The Black Dahlia

Granted, it had some good parts, but not enough to redeem the bad parts. The plot was extremely hard to follow. I did, however, love the costumes and the set design. It was very well done, and the camera looks like its more of the 1940's than a normal camera would. The soundtrack is excellent, but the movie itself is terrible.

Ever!,1,23 September 2006,"When most people say, ""That's the worst movie I've ever seen,"" they're usually just saying that because they've not given it serious thought. I, however, was coerced (not exaggerating) into seeing ""The Black Dahlia"" and upon leaving the theater, was so overcome with the will to die that I thought that this was indeed the worst film ever made. It is certainly the worst film I've ever seen, and I've seen Water World! But Why? Why is this film so wretched? Simple. It fails at every aspect of film-making.The story is convoluted, and while this can be a good thing (Chinatown's winding story, for example), The Black Dahlia's story is only convoluted because of unnecessary scenes, gratuitous sex and violence substituted for emotional tension, and the most pointless and clichéd voice-over narration I have ever heard.The direction is Blah, hardly any shot is innovative, original, creative, or unexpected. Nothing mind-blowing here.The acting is a bit over-the-top, and while this can be good in certain situations, it does not work here. Perhaps this is because it is not done well at all. Also, the casting is terrible, at least for the role of Bucky. Josh Hartnett, a baby-faced pretty boy, cannot play the role of hardboiled detective. It is not a matter of acting talent; it is a matter of physical appearance. (Oh, and he still sucks at acting) Cetain choices are made by the actors and screenwriter that lack all logic-Bucky meets Madeline at a lesbian nightclub, then is extremely shocked and angry when he finds out that she (gasp!) had sex with a woman.The murder is obvious. Anyone who didn't suspect the crazy mother is an idiot, unless they thought it was just too obvious to be true.The score was awful. Again, the film tries to be ""Chinatown"", but fails miserably. (That reminds me. ""The Score"" starring Ed Norton and Robert DeNiro was also awful, but it is still supremely better than ""The Black Dahlia"") The best part of the movie was the previews for Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed."" I know this doesn't technically count as a part of the film, but I'm trying to look for something positive to say.

They name a killer, when in reality one has never been found, and thats what makes the murder so notorious.Even from a technical aspect the movie was bad. Many of the scenes were noticeably out of focus, and most of the shots were bland.The whole movie makes Elizabeth Short look like a lesbian whore.

496,cine234,"I really wanted to like it, but...",2,16 January 2007,"...what a boring, pretentious piece of crap. Convoluted plot with some horrible acting by some normally very good actors. Laughable performances. Brian DePalma is absolutely terrible. Go watch his other movies again, and you;ll realize that he is incredibly overrated. The Untouchables? Horrible. Femme Fatale? Intolerable. The only good thing about this movie were the visuals, but even that couldn't make me sit through the entire film. The cinematography and production design is quite impressive, but it just wasn't enough to stop me from turning off my DVD player in disgust halfway through. And i tried real hard to like it.

497,bastionsrealm,Torture Via Celluloid,1,25 September 2006,"As much as I mourn the fact that my first review is an egger, I feel it my civic duty to warn the populace of this dreadful reel. I'll keep it short and succinct, as I do not take pleasure in bashing anything that at least assumes itself to be something artistic.Let's try to tackle the plot here. You can take your pick as to which one, there were about 6 of them poorly strewn into the course of the feature. Things started out fine as a mid 20s boxer drama. Then about twenty minutes into the movie we are introduced into a love trapezoid and a dirty-cop storyline. It was as if the writer wanted to suck the life out of every other genre just so he wouldn't have to deal with the supposedly main story arc, that being something about the dead actress; which doesn't even get a mention until more than half way through the movie, and from then on is nothing more than a footnote in a sidenote of some other black-comedy plot line.Be prepared to suffer through some completely arbitrary scenes. There are quite a few bastardized scenes that, for no other reason than to muddle the viewers' minds, get juxtaposed right in the middle of whatever topic Brian was focusing on at the moment. There's a lot of that going on. One minute you'll be trying to settle in with a vainly forced scene between two characters, then suddenly find yourself socked in the noggin' by a completely unnecessary shot of something happening a few blocks away.Alright, although this movie was a rotten grape, I feel that I must mention a redeeming factor. Josh Hartnet showed exemplary control over her mannerisms and expressions. He was after all, the main actor. He did a superb job of conveying any of the fifty bajillion emotions he was handed. Pat on the back for him. His partner was equally impressive, where as everyone else did their damnedest to ham it up as much as possible.Okay, but seriously, here's an example of bad film making. There's a line in the movie, right, ""You look just like that dead girl."" An actress says that line, and then the immediate line that follows it is a flashback to THAT LINE. Let that settle in. A FLASHBACK TO THE VERY LAST LINE OF DIALOGUE SPOKEN!!!!!!!!!! And it wasn't just an isolated incident, oh no. The entire film is gummed up with such pointless actions.Anyhoo, yay for Hartnet's performance, but boo to DePalma and his horribly wacky film. Yikes.",The Black Dahlia
498,leeannhelvenston,I almost blew off going to this film///glad I went!,8,17 September 2006,"First of all, I have been a big fan of De Palma since I saw 'Carrie' in high school. He is a rare breed-not afraid to take chances, and he is a true artist. For example, one cannot watch 'The Untouchables' or 'Carlito's Way' and not realize that the man is a gifted storyteller. That said, I will admit that the source material in 'The Black Dahlia' is challenging, to say the least. But that is exactly the kind of thing that a director like De Palma would want to take on. I am glad David Fincher passed on this project. Every nuance was perfect in this film, especially the set design and costumes. Obviously this man is working with the best in the business and always has. I was extremely gratified to see his old buddy Gregg Henry in the fight scene (real quickly). He must be tight with Brian, as he played a creep in 'Body Double', which I watch every time it is on uncut-----another great, underrated movie he made. I scoured the pages of my Sunday paper today and almost blew off the opportunity to see this movie----after reading some particularly scathing reviews--it has been my observation that this is a director who either inspires adoration or scorn. The cast was splendid, particularly Mia Kirshner, in a very difficult role-----her eyes conveyed a sense of foreboding----she could have made silent films, she is so expressive. See 'Exotica'----she should have become 'A' list after that performance. I also really liked Aaron Eckhart, and I simply adore Rose McGowan!!!! She is really a scene stealer!!! The flat bed truck picking up the other 'wannabes' in their Cleopatra garb was priceless! I hope this director forgets/ignores his detractors and realizes that he is a credit to his idol----Mr. Hitchcock himself. If one appreciates film, one should see this, if even for the historical value. What I want to know is how did he find so many areas of Los Angeles that looked like they were still in 1947? Finally, in this time when so many of my friends and coworkers are 'waiting until it comes out on DVD'-------it seems even more important to see movies in a theater setting that have had negative press.

De Palma have make of this movie a ""Film Noir"" with all visual and 'movietenologie'knowledge that he has, and that is a lot.The attentive viewer gets an inexhaustible flow of visual references to other films from this genre.The plot is just like the book on which it is loose based not simple, but it is sent by the nice control to a splendid film evening. Why the Palma got no money in America for this movie and for this reason wend to Europe is for me a riddle, and certainly when I see the flow of stupid movies that come from Hollywood that apparently get easy the necessary money.This movie is not a blockbuster... it's all about money... i think. This film deserves be examined by many people.",The Black Dahlia
500,toxiquil,I enjoyed this and here is why,7,24 September 2006,"I'm not a huge critic of movies. I don't like 'movie buffs' who know no other tone than condescending. In saying that, this is one movie, like most, that just isn't for everybody.I rated this movie a 7 for the following reasons. I gave points for attempting a noir-esquire feel. I like the gritty feel, and the grey shading of values/morals. Not knowing who's really good or bad. It's a nice twist to what is normally hitting big screens lately. I enjoyed how the storyline was all over the place. If you sit back, make no attempt to get the plot and just let it come to you, it's less nerve wracking. I admit that in watching it the first time, I didn't get the entire movie, there are still some parts in the first 20 minutes or so that I don't get. I also liked the dry humor, the stereotypical cigarette smoking and other noir like aspects. I am also a fan of Kirshner and thought she looked stunning. I do however, remember a moment in the movie where her acting was so forced that I laughed out loud. Anyone who remembers the ""trip"" knows what I mean. Aside from that, I enjoyed the movie and her performance especially.I was not a fan of the other actors previously but I went into this movie open minded and came out generally happy with it. Note I did not say this was a great movie, that's not my place. It's up for whoever watches it, to decide how they like or dislike this movie.",The Black Dahlia
501,moonchyld1980,Fact vs. Fiction,7,15 September 2006,"I tried to be unbiased going into watching this film, but I have to admit that it was very difficult for me to do so. I did not succeed 100% either.I heard about the ""Black Dahlia"" case some 10 years ago, and I was only 14 or 15 when I saw what I did - an E! program called ""Mysteries & Scandals"". It was by far the most disturbing thing I have seen thus far. Even now, years later, after I have viewed numerous documentaries on criminals, psychopaths, etc., I still have not shaken the impression that this case left on me, nor has anything disturbed me to a greater degree than the photographs and details of Elizabeth Short's demise.James Ellroy is a brilliant crime noir writer.I absolutely loved ""LA Confidential"", so I had very high hopes for this film adaption of his novel involving one of the most infamous unsolved murders of all time. What I want to preface my review by saying, however, is that if you are educated about the ""facts"" of the crime, you may want to prepare yourself for an absolutely fictionalized account of Betty Short's last days. Her murder is used as a centerpiece for the plot of this movie, but her death stands as an accessory to the muddled interaction between the main characters who are treated with much more importance than the person whom the film (and book)is named after.I was very impressed with the acting in this movie.I didn't dislike anyone that I saw slated to star in it, but no one on the bill was someone that I would say ""Wow, so and so is great in all of their movies!"" about. Josh Hartnett has an eerily resonating noir detective voice as he pilots us through the events of the film from his point of view. His grief is believable as he sees the people he loves around him be destroyed physically and emotionally for different reasons and by different factors. Aaron Eckhart is more impressive as his paranoid, Black-Dahlia obsessed partner. Scarlett Johansson is the woman caught between the two of them. As glamorous and beautiful as she is, however, she doesn't stand out as much as her co-stars.Hilary Swank is the crowning jewel in this varied mix of talent, playing the femme fatale Madeleine Linscott. You won't be able to take your eyes off of her, or keep your ears from hanging on her every word. She is seductive in one moment, callous in the next, then demure and innocent.Mia Kirschner is not wrong for the part of Elizabeth Short, but she is not completely right for it either. She pulls her weight, and is believable, but there is still something missing that I can't quite place.Visually, this film is beautiful, and you do get effectively caught up in the nostalgia of 1940's Hollywood. Brian de Palma does not take the atmosphere overboard. It's just right, and the viewer can get caught up in suspension of disbelief.All in all, I think I would have enjoyed this film much more if I didn't go into it knowing about the crime. If you do have knowledge of what really happened, I suggest you leave it at the theater door. If you can do that, than I really think you will enjoy the film as a work of fiction. It has intrigue, romance, sex, crime, and just enough displays of the human ""condition"" to make you reflect and identify on a deeper level . . .",The Black Dahlia
502,leatherface_94,"Great movie, can't understand all the complaints.",10,17 September 2006,"The Black Dahlia is an excellent homage to the classic film-noirs from the early days. The film is about two detectives working on the case of Elizabeth Short, an aspiring actress who was savagely murdered and dumped in a vacant Los Angeles lot in 1947. Everything in the film was beautiful, the cinematography was flawless and there were stunning visuals and camera tricks throughout, De Palma did an excellent job. The story was great, and it was a good adaptation of the novel. The acting was also very good, I can't say I disliked any of the players. I can't understand why so many people hated this film, but I personally thought it was great. It's just a movie that you have to pay attention to, otherwise you're prone to getting a little confused when the revelations come up at the ending. Who knows, maybe it's just a taste thing.

Both are Jewish girls.The film is worth the watch if you need something to make you drowsy.Mia is okay though.She is new to most viewers if you haven't seen the Lesbian show.

Unfortunately, this had none of the qualities that made that film great.This movie was a convoluted mess. Scarlett Johansson was a robot, Hillary Swank was laughable with her on-again/off-again accent and Josh Hartnett had absolutely no success carrying his role. He tried, mind you, but he was totally unbelievable as a noir-typical pug turned hard-nosed cop.The plot was convoluted, but a crazy plot doesn't always a good detective story make. Some scenes go nowhere, characters are introduced and forgotten about and others barely delved into.The emotional ties are not there and I was aching for the ending so that I could turn this off.I am highly disappointed.",The Black Dahlia
505,AManHisAgeAttemptingATango,"Stylish, but impossible to watch",2,16 September 2006,"This is a movie exploring the dark and seedy side of Hollywood, based on James Ellroy's book, and directed by Brian De Palma, it promised to be an interesting, if slightly horrific look at the murder of Elizabeth Short. She came to Hollywood in 1947 to become an actress only to watch her dreams brutally crash and burn in front of her eyes. Her hideously mutilated corpse was discovered by the police, but the killer never identified.The only reason I didn't give this movie a 1 (awful) rating, was due to the stylish aspect. A pleasure to watch but not to enjoy, Brian De Palma's skillful hand guides the movie through the rambling 121 minutes of gorgeous 1940's chic, a talent previously expressed in movies such as LA Confidential and Scarface. Otherwise, the movie totally fails. The acting fails to take advantage of the scope possible for this movie. Josh Hartnett, having shined in previous movies, is completely flat except for one brief display of believable emotion towards the end, Aaron Eckhart makes the most of his unsatisfying role, Hilary Swank is more disturbing than erotic as a femme fetale and Scarlett Johansson is her typical one-dimensional, pouty self.But the main failure of this movie is the incomprehensible plot. You find yourself wondering who people are halfway through the movie and the ending is completely unsatisfying. The convoluted plot is bogged down, not enhanced, by the many many subplots, most of which bring little to the already irritating storyline. Disappointing overall.",The Black Dahlia
506,cj-raspberry,Disappointment,4,17 September 2006,"After seeing the previews for The Black Dahlia, I was excited to see how this case was portrayed on the big screen. Josh Hartnett has long been a large favorite of mine, as is Hilary Swank.Unfortunately, after viewing the movie, I was more impressed with the comments from the couple behind me then in the actual film. It jumped here and there, and it seemed at the end they realized they needed to wrap it up. The only characters that were able to catch my attention were that of Hartnett and Swank. Johansson kept changing accents throughout and over acted a great deal. Not even half way through, most everyone in my party was tired of seeing the close-ups of her pouty lips. Seeing it the night after it's big release, we expected the place to be almost full, but the theater wasn't even half way full, and half way through the movie several groups got up and left. All in all I was unimpressed and wish I could have gotten my money back for the waste of 2 hours of watching something created to give Hartnett and Johansson a chance to publicly display their relationship.",The Black Dahlia
507,Xaurthaon,Not enough like the book,5,22 September 2006,"I read the book before watching the movie because the trailer made me interested. I don't usually do that, but I did. After watching the movie, I am not sure if I should do that again. The story is basically the same as the book, and the characters are the same, but some characters are left out of the story, some entire subplots, and basically the last half of the movie takes a slight alternative route from that of the book, and is slightly changed. Maybe that was done in order to make a better plot, but I couldn't concentrate on the movie, because I kept on noticing the differences between the book and the movie. Either way, movie is not bad, but not good. The stylistic 40's era period piece feel of the movie is not pulled off very well, and at times seems almost comical (unintentionally). I suppose one good thing about the departure from the book is that the movie keeps all the subplots and characters more closely tied in to one plot. And the movie, while at times, like the book, seems to meander a bit towards making you ask ""where is this going and what is the point?,"" does a better job of keeping a constant forward resolution of the plot. Overall, I am not sure whether the departure from the book is a good thing or bad, but if you have read the book, I might suggest that you may not like the movie all that much.Also, the acting was mediocre, which was surprising coming from some of my favorite actors.",The Black Dahlia
508,tchardy-1,Utterly disappointing,2,15 September 2006,"Nearly from the start of the movie it was clear something was wrong. In a scene filmed in a police department briefing room, the camera, set in the center of the room, pans 360 degrees to show all the occupants of the room. Unfortunately, something was wrong with the take and the whole shot is blurred. De Palma used it anyway.That flawed take -- and the decision to use it anyway -- is emblematic of the problem with the whole picture: sloppy film-making. Storytelling, pacing, characterization, even continuity editing are all half-baked. The movie's main flaw is following the book too closely. Ellroy's novel is packed with plot and characters, and De Palma was apparently unwilling to lose very much of it. Unfortunately, this makes for a lot of head-scratching for audience members. I was able to follow because I had read the book, but I heard a lot of confusion in the audience around me.A comparison with Curtis Hanson's L.A. Confidential, which adapted a similarly dense Ellroy novel without confounding the viewer, shows what a tragic waste De Palma makes of great source material. Where L.A. Confidential was taut and fluid, Black Dahlia sprawls in all directions.Word to the wise: If you read the book, forgo the movie -- it will only disappoint. If you didn't read the book, forgo the movie and read the book instead -- otherwise the movie may ruin it for you.",The Black Dahlia

510,su-39,Very Disappointing!,3,16 September 2006,"I was looking forward to this movie coming out for weeks. Now I have to tell you that it was a terrible movie and encourage you not to watch it.For those that don't know, the ""Black Dahlia"" is a true story about the unsolved brutal murder of Elizabeth Short in Los Angeles in 1947. No one has ever been convicted or charged with her murder. There are many theories, but all respectable criminologists or criminal psychiatrists would agree that it had to be the work of a psychopath or sociopath with good surgical training. This movie, which is based on the true ""Black Dahlia"" murder mystery, trivialized the poor girl's horrific death and had moments of terrible writing. At least twice, people in the audience laughed out loud (including myself) because the dialog was so bad. The story in the movie includes too many extraneous scenes that really do not make sense nor do they positively add to the core storyline in the least. The concept of the movie is that at the end all these different stories get explained together. The explanation they use to string the stories together are weak and unbelievable. The beginning of the movie starts out with the story of how the two primary cops, who were assigned to this case, met in the police. This takes far too long to tell and was really not that interesting. While I thought it was important that the movie describe just how corrupt the police force was at the time of Betty's murder, they went too far outside of the main story's scope to do this.Another major flaw of this movie is that they never present a three dimensional character for Elizabeth Short, the victim. According to documentaries about the real murder I have watched, different people that knew Elizabeth (or Betty) Short had very different perceptions of her. Only one perception of her was portrayed in this movie, which is the flattest and least interesting character perception of her.To sum up, this is an awful movie that should have never been released considering it does nothing but use Elizabeth Short's nickname, the ""Black Dahlia"", to help promote it. At the same time it also completely trivializes a real young woman's vicious murder.",The Black Dahlia

Fiona Shaw does a damn good job as the crazy alcoholic wife (she's in the Harry Potter films as Harry's aunt).

The reviews offering super high ratings are quite obviously fake. The gushing has no match to reality, and is clearly a cynical and disingenuous effort from those with financial interests in this film (studio, director, actors, agents... who knows?) to prop up this steaming mess. But in a way, this cynicism is a microcosm of pathos that should have been the strength of the film in the first place: telling the sad, pathetic story of the desperate wannabe starlet doomed to grisly fate within the grisly Hollywood reality. I can only reiterate what has already been said - this could have been a great film and indeed has some valuable components flooded under a deluge of incompetence. These are a good set of actors, so I can't fault them for their uneven performances. There was plenty of money to spend, so I can't blame the producers or the studio. The sets were very good, and some moments were visually excellent, but on balance the script was bloated and incoherent, the continuity and editing were almost embarrassing to watch, and most damning, the directing lacked... direction. I rate this below an Ed Wood flick, because although Ed Wood lacked talent and funding, he had heart.

513,dergybaby,Apology to the Memory of Black Dahlia,3,16 September 2006,"I just returned from watching the movie ""The Black Dahlia"" and must say i am very very disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the movie was shot beautifully, the customs and the feel of the era were very well captured and the cast was decent enough. However, the big problem i have with this is that once again Hollywood and the production companies used the name and the profile of a poor young women who was brutality murdered in the 1940's Los Angeles to unload a heaping pile of C**p on the unsuspecting moviegoers. Now, I understand that the movie was based on a book that has very little to do with the case itself. Well, if that is the case, why not just call it a different title, and not use the name to bring in audiences. I walked into the movie expecting to at least see some resemblance of the truth about the actual murder. Instead what i got was a two hour rambling of nonsense about subplots, and boxing and mobsters and two bit pimps and some really over the top and emotional detective, which was never explained why he was so obsessed with the case in the first place. I think the memory of Elizabeth Short has once again been victimized to produce a movie which has nothing to do with her demise and to sell it to the public, via the T.V. ads and trailers. Since i think it is very unlikely that anyone in the industry will actually apologize for exploiting this poor women's violent demise, I will go ahead and do it for all of us. Elizabeth Short, wherever you may be, please except our apologies in exploiting your name and demise in order for us to make a quick buck.

To use her murder as back drop to a tired old noir formula is to further disgrace her.Sixty years ago a young woman was horribly murdered, and her body displayed in a shocking way to further defile her.

Also it leaves you with asking a lot more questions after the movie than before seeing the movie. You are introduced to characters that have no relevance to the story or do hot make sense as to why they are there. All in all this movie is just one giant mess. I had been intrigued about the Elizabeth Short murder a couple of weeks ago when the Sunday paper I read had an insert that was a reprint from 1947 about the killing of the Black Dahlia.

519,tjkorb,Hartnett's butt not cute enough to save 'Dahlia',1,19 September 2006,"I guess I was truly naive in thinking that, due to the movie's title and carefully selected clips available on the movie's website, the film would actually be ABOUT the Black Dahlia murder case of 1947. I was painfully and totally mistaken, and the result is that my wallet is $11 lighter, 3 hours of my time were wasted, and my disgust with Hollywood is at an all-time high. (Oh, and I'm also not too thrilled with the hundreds of ""movie-goers"" who were obviously paid by 'Dahlia' producers to give the movie a '10' rating in online databases in order to deceive unknowing viewers into throwing away their time and money on a terrible film). 'The Black Dahlia' is a convoluted hodgepodge of gruesome homicidal and sexual twists that the producers obviously thought would be strange enough to evoke public interest. Apparently the original case, the details of which are more than enough to create the foundation of a brilliant, suspenseful murder mystery, were not ""thrilling"" or ""edgy"" enough for the modern audience. This prompted Hollywood to take a little ""creative license"" with the story and throw in lesbian porn, insane, alcoholic socialites, maimed, sadistic gardeners, and inexplicable blackmail subplots to spice up the storyline. It's as if 'Dalia' writers threw a hundred brilliantly colored puzzle pieces into a bag, tossed them around a bit, and hoped that they would form some kind of logical picture, or that at least audiences would be so confused that they would just assume the plot was a masterpiece, like a piece of trash passed off as ""modern art."" And whenever they felt that the dialogue was lacking, the simple solution was ""Hey! Let's have Josh Hartnett pin someone else to a table in a fit of violent love-making!"" Which, of course, would be fascinating if it were happening in first-person. Seeing as it's NOT, it serves as a poor band-aid for a mortally-wounded storyline. In the end, the single detail that remains unchanged between the infamous murder case and the movie bearing the same name is, in fact, the name. There was, at least, one bright spot in the film. It came in the form of Josh Hartnett's adorable butt, which neither the hole-ridden plot nor over-played lesbian porn could ruin. But, however gorgeous, a 5-second glimpse of Josh's behind is not worth $11 (actually, that would be pretty pathetic if it was).",The Black Dahlia
520,neilbaxta,Terrible!!!!,1,18 September 2006,"Seriously confusing, messed up rubbish!!! Had potential with it's 1940s look, but storyline and script drastically let it down!!!! VERY VERY BORING....apart from Scarlett in her HUGE knickers!!!! would not recommend unless having difficulty getting to sleep...goes on and on and on and on FOREVER!!!! Was very disappointed as I was looking forward to this flick, had previously read about the real life murder of Elizabeth Short and thought this movie would go into it in depth, but it didn't...was almost as if the murder was a sub plot to Josh Hartnett's love affairs!!! There was very little factual information in the film, was all made up rubbish that didn't need to be included!!! Avoid this movie at all costs...OK it was rather nicely filmed, but that doesn't make up for all the boredom and confusion!!! Bad Bad movie!!!!",The Black Dahlia

The only recommendation was the editing which could have strengthened the film but I was not disappointed and the Shaw stole the show. OK, I don't talk about it enough IMDb fine. The music was good but I was hoping that the original singer in the film was included in the score along with Stevie Wonder. Still not long, Okay, This is nuts, change the rule, why so drawn out or a need? I think a lot of people are trashing this film who are original Dahlia fans and keep in mind they did not want this film made to start with but it did go with the book and was a fictional noir film.",The Black Dahlia

Confidential, they weren't all that bad eitherOne thing about Dahlia though, they purposely made the movie like they were made in the '40's, when nearly all of the screen actors came from Broadway and Stage plays, where they had to overact for the audiencesThe result is that the over-the-top acting (not an ounce of subtlety in the whole film) makes the film hilarious!!!being a Brian De Palma film (Scarface), the blood- letting is a given, but the scenes in which one of the cops runs out of the office while the other cops are watching a stag film, or Hillary Swank doing a dead-on impersonation of a '40's-style actress made me double over in laughterBut those were nothing compared to the Ham-Of-The-Year award that belongs to Fiona Shaw (the unattractive school-marm in (Three Men & a Little Lady and Harry Potter's mean aunt in the Potter films)Her campy scene-stealing had the whole audience busting out laughingAlthough it wasn't intended, I think that The Black Dahlia is probably the funniest film that I've seen so far this year",The Black Dahlia
523,happynesis-1,Disappointed,1,27 September 2006,"I wanted this to be a great movie. Unfortunately the preview was the best part. It was clear in the first 30 minutes that it was a disorganized, poorly edited attempt at Film Noir. The acting isn't great either. I'm still not sure what it had to do with the Black Dahlia. Some of the sets seemed to be cramped. Also, there was some first person filming...the audience sees out of Josh H's eyes. Was this because he was off that day? That's what it seems like because there was no reason for it. That scene could have been omitted and it wouldn't have mattered. I really think it was the worst movie I ever saw. I don't walk out of movies, but, lot's of others did.",The Black Dahlia

It was extremely slow, and so many story lines were going on at once it was impossible to see where things were going. It was so confusing it ended up being like watching a bunch of random scenes that had nothing to do with each other- making it extremely dull. Scarlett's acting was not her best either, and downright unbelievable. There were parts that were so bad that the audience started laughing- and I really don't think it was meant to be a comedy. If you really feel the urge to see this movie, I'd suggest renting it so you can fall asleep on a comfortable couch rather than a hard theater seat.",The Black Dahlia

With the talent that was present in the cast, you would think that it would make up for the lack of focus on the plot. Not so much. It was like they were trying to mimic the movie style of the 1940's by exaggerating their lines, playing the score too loud and the facial expressions...don't get me started! There were so many different stories going on, all at once, that by the end they were all tangled together. The ending left me cold, and the most believable character was Balto, the stuffed dog!

It's been awhile since I saw a movie that I feel like I put my trust in was going to be a certain kind of movie only to end up feeling like I got punished for going to see it. Sometimes the marketing department markets it to seem like a different kind of movie than it actually is but that wasn't the case here. That close-up of blood on the curtains toward the end after crazy rich woman killed herself made me feel like I'd wandered into an Ed Wood meets slasher flick arena versus the kind of movie it was touted to be.

527,llong02,Do not see this movie!!!,1,21 September 2006,"If you are looking for a movie that discusses the Black Dahlia murder, do not attempt to see this one. Many folks are defending this movie based on the fact that it was based on the book titled ""The Black Dahlia"". Well, then I'd have to say, don't read that book if you are looking into a novel that discusses the Black Dahlia murder.I say this because, to the outsider who has never heard of the book, and has simply heard of the murder, would automatically assume that the movie has some relevance to the murder. And simply said, it does not. No part of this movie is relevant to the murder. None of it. Period.I feel that the movie company did us a disservice and conned the public to see a movie about the murder of Beth Short. Unfortunately, you see a movie about a group of people that are over emotional and revolved around each other, not the murder.People have said that the movie was not supposed to be about her murder, it was supposed to be about the stress that this group of individuals have over the murder. Then why title the movie (or the book for that matter) The Black Dahlia!!! This story could have revolved around any murder of Joe Shmoe off the street and still have the same script.And speaking of the script, I could not believe how terrible they made Elizabeth Short out to be! Obviously, these individual's have no respect for the dead, and are smearing the name of an innocent young girl. Insead of remembering her as a victim of a horrible tragedy, these people would rather the public remember her as a small town slut.I felt that the only reason that the book and the movie was titled the way it was, was a publicity stunt. It was a way to con the public. Make them buy a book or go to a movie that they feel is about a subject that it doesn't predominantly cover.In general I would have to say that this was the biggest waste of 7.50 I have ever had to pay.",The Black Dahlia
528,ziskaljo,best movie of 06 so far,10,22 September 2006,"In all of the reviews that I have read of The Black Dahlia thus far, the negative reviews have all come from people expecting a replication of the case itself or people too ignorant to follow the story.DePalma directed the script to near perfection.Perhaps the people who did not appreciate The Black Dahlia will also question why The Black Dahlia and Brian DePalma will win Academy Awards. The Black Dahlia was very artistic as well as cinematic; however, those with the cinematic outlook may have missed the artistic quality and discounted the film.While viewing the film, I felt as if I were viewing a film from the 40's (i.e. Casablanca or Citizen Kane) based on the cinematic feel and the quality acting, rather than viewing a modern film based on events from the 40's. Josh Hartnett, Scarlett Johansson, and Hilary Swank all delivered remarkable performances.I would consider the film to be a ""smart-person's"" film simply because of the complex plot. I would not recommend the film to your 12-year-old daughter or your high school drop-out husband because they will only complain that they ""don't get it"" and that they understood the first 3/4 of the film but not the last half hour. For those that were lost by the plot of The Black Dahlia...The Little Mermaid is being released on DVD next Tuesday! (I'm not gonna give away much here, but I want to highlight some things that DePalma did well so you can look for them when you view the film). As far as DePalma's high points...the lighting was sensational. The shot when the dead body was first discovered is sensational. I also really appreciate DePalma's knowledge of classic films as he references Citizen Kane toward the end of the film with the obnoxiously loud crow in the flashback scene.For those that did not like The Black Dahlia, I would recommend studying film a bit and giving it a second viewing. For those who have not seen the film, I would recommend you see it ASAP. For those who have seen it and appreciated it, consider yourselves better than those who did not appreciate the masterpiece!",The Black Dahlia

Ifind it very hard to believe there were nightclubs for lesbians in 1940s Los Angeles like presented in this movie. There are no such clubs for these women NOW in Los Angeles! The plot is blurry and makes no sense and it seems to focus on a family of complete KOOKS (with Hillary Swank as one of the daughters in a classic CAMP role that makes it hard to believe she has won 2 Oscars). The writing is horrible - ""SHE LOOKS LIKE THAT DEAD GIRL - HOW SICK ARE YOU???"" by Scarlett Johanson's character is one of the more ""laugh-out-loud"" bad lines. All I can say is what a waste. And painting the real Black Dahlia, Elizabeth Short, as a lesbian and an idiot is very unfair. She doesn't deserve to be remembered in this way.",The Black Dahlia
530,seosamh1963,a film to love /a film to hate,7,22 September 2006,I agree with posters who say there is to much emphasis on the trio--- as I call them(played by Harnett Johansenn & Ekhart) For me Hilary Swank is the star of the movie and the trio are supporting players Mia Kirschner was enthralling in her role and Fiona Shaw overplayed her scenes somewhatThat said I loved the look of the movie . My companion at the movies (a collector of vintage clothes and memorabilia from the post WWII period) enthused about the look but couldn't follow the plot. I followed the plot (just about) I also liked the underlying elements of the story --but not the way in which the earliest parts of it were told. I don't want to put in two many spoilers but there are parallel pairings and triangles at the heart of the storySo what would have improved it IMHO condensing the first half hour into a shorter period and maybe having it in flashback --- The shooting scene where the mysterious old snitch dies should open the movie then maybe a short flashback to tell with a minimum of images how the two became partners the reverie be interrupted by the finding of the Dahilia. ----Then we meet ms lake and a flashback ( somewhat longer) tells how the trio came to be. ----The news that Dewett is to be released should be slipped into a meeting as part of the investigation of the Dahlia case otherwise ----The movie could proceed as released with a little of the saved time given to clarifying the twists of the plot as I would also have liked increased clarity for viewers like my companion.In short as I said I both loved it and hated it Seosamh,The Black Dahlia

Don't even wait until it comes out on DVD, which, if there is any justice, will be in about twenty minutes. So many more things could have been done to make this movie interesting, but there wasn't even anything done to make it watchable. The end drags horribly- and everything feels revoltingly tacked-on.

I wanted to know about Elizabeth Short and her life, how she came to be where she was etc. This movie was about the sex life of a cop. I had already ordered the book before we went to see this joke of a movie and I have it now. It's actually not bad. Since I realized before beginning the book that it was fiction based on a true event I really didn't expect much reality. However, the book is definitely better than the movie.

The plot was quick and in depth, with an unexpected outcome for each individual character. However, the reoccurring porn video was completely unnecessary and took away any respect I had for the movie as a whole. I didn't see any any point in including the porn except to emphasize how twisted the murderer was, and that could have been portrayed in a much more tasteful manner. I understand the film is rated R, however I am frankly disgusted by the graphic and pointless ""stag movie"" scene, and wish the director would have used a little more integrity in making this film.",The Black Dahlia
534,vincent-romain,The Black Disaster,3,8 October 2006,"Brian De Palma's The Black Dahlia is outright one of the most ridiculous movies I've ever watched from a director with such a reputation. I stand corrected: it is one of the most ridiculous movies ever, period.Each and everyone of the actors is either miscast (Hillary Swank! Josh Hartnett!!) or not up to his task (most of the others). Some of them have on top of that fallen prey to some of the worst overacting in cinematic history (Aaron Eckhart! Fiona Shaw!!!). Scarlet Johansson may be considered the most sexy woman gracing the screen today, but her part is virtually nonexistent, unless you define a part as holding a cigarette and a succession of outrageously cliché sexy looks. De Palma even succeeds in making her look like a pastiche of a sex doll, with those hellishly red lips, that hair so platinum blonde that it seems to radiate and a face make-up that is more suited for a death mask. And, lest I forget, the dialogs were positively ludicrous. Add to that the part of KD Lang as a lesbian singer and a lesbian ballet dance number (if you have to believe this movie half the population of Los Angeles in the forties consisted of lesbians) and you do not know whether to laugh or to cry.The greatest disaster of all was the plot. I dare not even coin the term 'screenplay' here. When you adapt a novel by James Ellroy, famous for his protracted and intricate plots that span years and years of interwoven personal histories, either you rein in the plotting, dropping along the way a few subsidiary story lines, or you make a three hour movie so you can do all those story lines justice. Instead the movie compresses everything into ninety minutes. The consequence: At the end of the movie so much enigmas need to be resolved that the last fifteen minutes constitute the most contrived piece of cinema I've ever had the occasion to view.Obviously a disaster of a movie calls for a disaster of an ending too. Of course Hartnett and Johansson get together after all they've been through. Which is rather pathetic, considering the dark and perverse atmosphere that De Palma has, in vein, tried to convey during the movie with the help of horned dildo's, lesbian scenes and his usual explicit horror that is boring rather than shocking.This director needs a) a retirement b) a shrink c) a ban from directing.

I thought that this was going to be the mystery of the Black Dahlia's life and death. Instead, I got an LA Confidential ripoff with a small side of the Black Dahlia murder. There was virtually no solid storyline, just a whole bunch of back stories and secondary stories. The acting was so bad that it was actually almost comical to watch.

I would like to ask the editors of IMDb to research this and make the necessary corrections.It is not fair to the Studios that they are not credited appropriately, especially on a web site like IMDb, so incredibly popular.I wanted to email the writers of IMDb, but no email is provided for contact.This is why I have to fill this comment with useless lines.Like this one.And this one.",The Black Dahlia

The girl who plays the Dahlia looks like a young Liz Taylor, very pretty, light eyes, roundish face and nice figure, you're supposed to buy that everyone thinks she's a dead ringer for Hillary Swank, this flat as a board, dark eyed, jaw like Max Headroom, boy in a dress.

I read the book The Black Dahlia, written by James Ellroy. While it contained all the traditional Ellroy characteristics (eg. angst-ridden characters, numerous plot lines, disturbing images, complicated dialogue) it was thoroughly enjoyable. The Brian de Palma remake, however, was less than stellar. I happen to be a big fan of most of the cast, but it seemed that they were directed to ""act badly"". Had this movie come out in the period it was set in, it probably would've been good, even ahead of it's time. But to come out 60 years later, not even remotely related to the original Black Dahlia case, with terrible sets, and even worse acting, it is something that can and should be missed. If I can give you some advice, read the book. Even better, watch L.A. Confidential, same author, different director. I now understand why such a stellar cast would get involved in such a crap movie. With Kim Basinger winning the Oscar for her performance in L.A. Confidential, perhaps some of these actors were looking to cash in on the Ellroy money train.

544,johnmcn25,Film about the brutal murder of a young woman and the rivalry of two LA detectives.,7,24 November 2006,"The modern noir film 'Black Dahlia' is an epic film based upon the book of the same name. The film follows the investigation of the vicious and sadistic murder of the young Elizabeth Short. The film also parallels this murder mystery with the rivalry of two LAPD detectives who are obsessed with the murder and find themselves quickly entwined in a world of corruption, drugs, rape and murder. The film utilizes the best actors in the business with Hilary Swank providing a powerful performance as Madeleine Linscott, the daughter of a rich tycoon with a serious lack of morals, Josh Hartnett as Dwight ""Bucky"" Bleichert, a LAPD detective seeking justice at any price, Aaron Eckhart as Lee Blanchard, another LAPD detective, who has become insanely obsessed with the murder of Elizabeth Short ""The Black Dahlia"" and Scarlett Johansson as Kay Lake, Lee's trophy partner and Bucky's love interest. One of the most electrifying performances however, comes from Mia Kirshner who plays the late Ms Short. Her stunning portrayal of this poor murder victim should win her Best Supporting Actress, which she rightly deserves. The direction of the movie can be disappointing at times but nonetheless highlights the horrible tale of the gruesome murder of an innocent victim by a deranged psychopath(s). The film also tends to at times, sway more in the way of Mr Ellroy's literary poetic license than the truth. This film proves to be more of a tribute to the author James Ellroy than Ms Short herself and that proves to be the biggest disappointment. The film, through the actors technique, makes up for this lack of direction with the powerful message of murder and crime in the different elements of society. This was a good film.

It's like the actor's were given a script for an hour long film and they tried to stretch it out to 150 minutes. Dramatic pauses are no longer dramatic if the film is full of them. I sat through the whole thing, waiting for it to be good, but I was completely disappointed.

City Hall was not enough.A good cast, but not believable in dialog or actions. These people could have been better but were at the mercy of a script with none of the forties noir mystique.

I am sorry for director Brian De Palma and the cast. I had to wash dishes and do other chores just to make it to the end of the climax of the movie when the mother was reliving and narrating the supposed crime scene. It's unfortunate that those of my generation who believe in freedom of self-expression end up wasting our time and money on these remakes.

Those reviewers and viewers who expected focus on the 1940s murder itself were of course disappointed, and those who don't get De Palma's perfectionist intent will also miss a lot. The acting is 1940s-stylistic film noir acting as are the plot twists, but making liberal use of 21st Century film-related technologies, which is what an ""authentic film noir period piece"" ought to be, precisely.I'd compare it - acting included - to ""The Big Sleep"" - alas, sans only that which a director cannot create....the emotional chemistry of two great stars falling desperately in love.But, short of that, this is a sleeper, and merits a second viewing on DVD.",The Black Dahlia

Not even they could make something of this tripe. I truly hope they were compensated well for their ""participation."" The scenes were contrived - I get that the acting may have been a nod to film noir, but c'mon. The plot was so convoluted, it made it difficult to care, let alone follow. I started the movie last night and got a migraine halfway through... which I thought to be unrelated at the time.... after finishing the movie this afternoon...

After watching the movie in question, I realized that the reviews I read were all horrible...This film was engrossing, entertaining, amazingly accurate in wardrobe and lingo and most of all well acted and written. I think a lot of people were upset because it wasn't the CASE it was the NOVEL! thats right NOVEL as in FICTION!! If you saw it in the theater i can understand missing something in the plot line...i will agree it required undivided attention...but rent the DVD, watch the extras and give it a fair shot before you blast it so fiercely. I suspect that the people who gave such bad reviews were looking for Snakes on a Plane and accidentally walked into the wrong film...If you like the genre and De Palmas directing style and visual genius you will be pleased with this film!

Watching this film evoked a whole new urge to speak out, to rant, and to warn others about how utterly confusing, annoying, and bad this movie was.I really think that the subject matter of this movie had the absolute potential to be really great. Instead, however, it was a carnival of different and ultimately unnecessary plot lines that attempted to interview but ended up just colliding turning into a trampled over mess on the floor.So much of the movie had me stopping, rewinding, and asking why. If it wasn't the confusing plot, it was the incomprehensible speaking done by the actors. What was the deal with earthquake? Or the 2 minute boxing scene? Or the Lee-Kay-Bucky love triangle in general? Who cares? Let's talk about the Black Dahlia, or her murder case, or her the potential suspects of her murder.

OK, be an ""artiste"" if you must, but for God's sake, let's make some of the actors lines comprehensible. I swear to God some directors think it adds to the dramatic element to have viewer's sitting forward in their chairs saying, ""What the f*** did he say?"" In Black Dahlia, the lead actor, JH is incomprehensible most of the time. He even had Scarlett Johanson doing it.

It became quite obvious after watching it for a short time that the movie was just jumping all over the place. There are too many subplots in this movie, too many back stories, and in my opinion some unnecessary & distasteful scenes---but the summary of it all is that I waited through it the entire 2 hours hoping all these mish-mashed details would fall together---but it never did---I was just as confused as I was during the movie.

The movie sure is not the best I ever seen (following my impressions to Mr. Ellroy L.A. Confidential sure is much better and Kim Basinger much more sexy than Ms.Johansson or Ms. Swank) but one for which I payed not only the Ticket for the Cinema but also for the DVD. What I don't like (in the book and in the movie) is the psychedelic story of Blanchard. Because of this movie I studied for more than 10 hours the ""true story"" of Ms. Short by seeking the Internet. I found many sites, cruel original pictures of the found of the body, many theories but not answers. Crude Theories of people like the son of Mr. Hodel who as a former Police Detective says that is father Dr. Hodel is the murderer (after retiring from LAPD) I found in the Web as much as people are thinking to make money with others stories. Last I tried to find out more about the (short) life of Miss Short and about her family (where are they today and so on) but failed. No other movie has such influence to me.

It's fun to go 'aha!' at the end of a mystery movie - the audience should be led towards figuring out the answer themselves.

Even though I didn't know some of the many movie ""goofs"" until I read them here, you could sense that things were not quite right with the production.

People were dying all over the place and I wish that I had a notebook so i could write all of the loose ends down. But everything slowly came together. If any of these other reviewers had stopped shaking their heads and judging everything critically, they might have noticed the way the film was going. The audience could make inferences on some of the loose ends just by watching each scene. Half of the story was understood by the end, despite the fact that it was never even hinted about. The end showed every connection and the movie blossomed. If you even take the effort to try and understand the sub plots, you come to realize the true intricacy of the entire mess.

Johanssen and Swank phoned in their parts, and Hartnet stuck a fork in his career.Watched this with another couple, ONE person wanted to see it through to the end, the rest of us wanted to wash dishes instead.There were times when it seemed like it was trying to be funny, like it was trying to parody itself.

I don't think she can pull off the whole ""suductress"" act very well. I loved Aaron Eckhart in this movie, I think he did great! Although I did really like Mia Kirshner as Elizabeth even if she didn't have many lines.She portrayed not only the good side of Elizabeth well, but the bad one very well also.

564,LincolnMarkV,Ian McNeice is the only actor worth watching,1,29 January 2007,"I'm so upset that there isn't a ""0"" rating available. Giving this film a ""1 (awful) is way too kind. Ian McNeice as the coroner provides the only bit of decent acting, and his role is about two seconds long. There is really only one reason to watch this movie, and that is to see just how truly awful an awful movie can be. What a stinker! A realistic plot would nice, considering that the Black Dahlia murder is a fairly intriguing piece of grisly history from the archives of unsolved cases. But no, let's create a ridiculous, totally unbelievable one instead, involving a bunch of people no one could possibly care about and try to elevate their lives to something meaningful. Were it not for the wretched acting, one would fall instantly asleep, for there is no plot at all.Scarlett Johansson's acting skills consist entirely of walking around with her mouth hanging open, bringing to mind nothing other than an unfortunate Downs Syndrome sufferer. This is further underscored by heavy 1940s lip gloss, making this otherwise very pretty girl positively hideous. In profile, she actually appears Simian. Someone's idea of ""sexy,"" I suppose.Josh Harnett is laughable as Officer ""Bucky"" Bleichert. His take on Mickey Spillane is to ride about in an old car and look pained. The result? He looks like Josh Hartnett riding about in an old car looking pained. In one scene (someone's idea of ""steamy"") he tears off a table cloth fully laden with dishes, flings Scarlett across it, and attempts to have impromptu sex. What provokes this burst of passion is a bigger mystery than who killed Elizabeth Short. Sexy? No, but it's screamingly funny. But waitit's not meant to be funny. Hilary Swank is equally dreadful, stuck in a pointless role, faintly akin to one so much better served by Faye Dunaway in ""Chinatown."" And after all, ""Chinatown"" is what this movie is trying so hard to be. Poor Hilary. What a lousy role.Other parts of the movie are so risible you'd swear it was a SNL skit. Fiona Shaw, for instance. I was screaming with laughter from the moment she appeared with that drunken, constipated smirk on her face until she last waved ta-ta from the balcony and blew off her head.

Maybe it was my low expectations, but I thought the movie acquitted itself of being a ""wait for the DVD"" review. First, don't go with the expectation of seeing a murder mystery, this is not about tracking down bad guys and solving a crime. This is a movie about relationships. You best be aware at the get-go about paying attention to the dialog in order to understand what is going on. The low point came when Rose McGowan was interviewed by one cop and looked more like an old imitation of of her TV Charmed role. The problem is that what she says sets up the rest of the movie. If you dismiss her delivery without paying attention to what she says, you can quickly get lost and frustrated. In fact, the movie requires the viewer to be an active listener of all the dialog in order to understand what's going on...If you are into passive entertainment, go to another movie. The movie does have a lot of holes and weak points. Hillary Swank's accent comes in and out at odd times. One cop beats up a main character in one scene, and he returns without a scratch in the next scene. Scarlett Johanson is a poor man's Kim Bassinger from L.A. Confidental, but she still exudes a passable sexual aura. In spite of these shortcomings, the late 40s style of the movie captures the time better than any other work I've seen. The two police buddies give very credible performances. The storyline is smart and DePalma does tie everything up in the end. The dinner at Hillary Swank's house is worth the price of admission. I howled out loud when the mother discussed her obligations at the table. In L.A. Confidential, you had an almost perfect blend of action keeping pace with the dialog and acting. This movie is more uneven in its balance, but still delivers credible entertainment",The Black Dahlia

Knowing Leonard's style of weaving a story and simmering several subplots at the same time, I tried my best to follow the film version but had no luck following the broken trail. On the plus side though, sets were good, as was lighting and for the most part costuming. The only character that I felt wasn't waiting to hear someone call ""Lunch, one hour"" was Fiona Shaw aka Ramona Linscott.

First off, the movie takes about 45 minutes to even get to the murder, and the stuff that is mentioned before it is worthless and has nothing to do with the actual movie. The movie did not even seem to focus on the murder, but on Josh Hartnett's character.

So I think that a lot of people were expecting this film to be on the same par as LA confidential. However, with The Black Dahlia, this is not the case. With DePalma at the helm you do not know what to expect, considering some of the films he has made in the past. But I think he follows a basic Film Noir format, with low camera angles and shadows, considering they had a great director of photography and set designer.However, the main thing in the film that bugs me a lot, is that Hilary Swank looks nothing like Mia Kirshner, despite the make up artists best attempts. Overall the casting was decent, Hartnett, Eckhart and Johansson played their roles well, but the standout performance for me was Mia Kirshner, she was superb as Elizabeth Short.Overall, I think if you expect this to be another LA Confidential, or expect a lot from it, then you will be extremely disappointed, but if you just take the film for what it is, then it's still a decent film.7 out of 10",The Black Dahlia

At first, I didn't know it was based off a novel, so I was really disappointed. It takes about 30 minutes until we actually see the body, and even then it seems like more of a subplot than a main one. The 2 cops, played by Harnett and Eckert, are really uninteresting. I couldn't be compelled by either's story. They both are going after another criminal while the investigation of Dahlia is going on. Then you have the love affairs with Harnett and Hilary Swank's character, along with Scarlett Johansson's character. It feels like the movie knows it's dull, so it throws in a softcore porno clip. Eventually, all the other plots come together in the end when it is revealed who was the mastermind behind the murder, but it takes forever to explain. All in all, it could have been way better.

The plot is an incoherent mess. Voice-over explanations toward the end of the film is the only way you can tell that Black Dahlia was even intended to make sense. Script is terrible. Hartnett is miscast. The only talented performers in the film are hobbled by the convoluted script. The best moments of the film are the black & white ""audition"" clips starring Mia Kirschner. She delivers the only stand-out performance in the entire film.I thing the project went off the rails by trying to translate Ellroy's odd rambling style of writing too literally into film. Ellroy's books are magnificent sloppy messes; full of plot holes, dead ends, unresolved threads, etc. This works in novel form, but its poison to a traditional film.Ellroy's books shine because of the sheer brilliance of their writing, not for their sleek and sensible plots. The genius of Ellroy's writing just doesn't make it into this film. The broad rambling plot is the only aspect of the original novel that makes it into the film.

584,raywode,"An embarrassing, incoherent mess",1,17 September 2006,"What a waste. As many have already pointed out, this film's so-called script is an utter disaster. Ditto for DePalma's alleged direction. I wasn't even impressed with the visuals. The photography, sets and costuming did their jobs in recreating postwar Los Angeles but that was it. As far as acting, the unfortunate cast in this dog of a movie did an adequate job with two exceptions, one bad, one good. First, the bad: Scarlett Johansson spends virtually the entire film wearing an odd vacuous look on her face. This is the first time I've seen her on screen and considering all the raves about her supposed talent, I was disappointed. The good: Mia Kirshner's Black Dahlia, the real-life Elizabeth Short, is the only compelling and sympathetic character here. Her performance perfectly captures this beautiful but doomed young woman's naiveté, desperation, loneliness and sadness...it's easy to understand why LAPD cops Bleichert and Blanchard fall under her posthumous spell. Unfortunately, that is the only understandable thing in this cinematic train wreck.",The Black Dahlia
585,nstephens8,"Bad, but Hilary Swank was great",1,9 February 2007,"I agree with most of the comments that this movie was pitiful. The story was all over the place and there was no glue to bring it all together. L.A. Confidential was a supreme Film-Noir film and is a tough act to follow even for a James Ellroy book. I had a hard time with Josh Hartnett in this role, but I don't think he is that good of an actor anyways. I expected a better portrayal of the Zoot Suit Riots, because it had a feel of B-movie or TV style planned chaos. But I disagree with a few postings that Hilary Swank was out of her element. I am not a Hilary Swank super-fan, but I think in this movie she was the only light in the noir. I actually wasn't even certain it was her, because she was so in character. Just a small positive for this disappointment. James Ellroy is still genius.",The Black Dahlia
586,tieman46,4th Viewing: Masterpiece,10,4 April 2011,"""The Black Dahlia"" is about the 1947 murder of Hollywood starlet Betty Short, but it is wrong to simplify the movie as a modern film noir. Director Brian De Palma's sensitivity explodes what people think of as the noir genre, the director turning ""Dahlia"" into something more personal: a consideration of the price paid by those who live in the Hollywood environment, either by working within the film industry or under the sway of movie mythology.Early in his career, De Palma combined an interest in movies with the radicalized social principles of the day. Influenced by the French New Wave and especially the political concentration of Godard, De Palma satirized/subverted movie traditions, particularly the excesses of German Expressionism.Mix this style with a little 60's anarchy, and you have a filmmaker who's sceptical about the structures of classical Hollywood storytelling. As such, all De Palma's early films were highly counterculture. Consider ""Hi Mom!"", ""Phantom"", ""Rabbit"", or ""Greetings"", the only movie of its time to address draft-dodging.Young De Palma satirized movie forms, learning to master them while revising them. This has confused many critics, who only latch onto the source of De Palma's improvisations but don't connect to the critical mind that drives them.So to understand ""Dahlia"" it is necessary to recognize that De Palma is a genre satirist with moral feeling. That ""Dahlia"" is more concerned about penetrating the Hollywood-noir genre, upending its conventions and emphasizing its social and political bases. Like ""Casualties of War"", De Palma is appalled by the history he must recreate, just as he was appalled when draft dodging students were his subject.And so ""Dahlia"" plunges into politics with its first scene, a 1940's race riot in which the police casually watch white servicemen beat up Latinos. It is here where our two heroes meet. One's called Bucky, the other Lee, but it doesn't take long for them to become coded and victimized like movie stars, dubbed ""Fire and Ice"" by the LAPD, their hot and cold temperaments reflecting their contrasting styles.From here on the film more resembles Altman's ""The Player"" than ""The Big Sleep"", the film less interested in mystery than the nightmares that exist beneath Hollywood's glittery veneer. And like most of De Palma's films, the plot hinges around an ineffectual hero who somewhat incompetently reconstructs truths which reside in plain sight, directly under his nose.Interestingly, De Palma's usual approach to sex and violence is completely revoked. The bombastic sexual/violent imagery of ""Body Double"" and ""Scarface"" have all been replaced with the discretion used in his more political films. This is a moral and political choice. The film's many shots of wounded actresses, extra's in cattle carts and girls forced into nudie flicks (as well as dying fathers) are not intended to excite or titillate, they're meant to disturb.Likewise, the ""satirical"" or ""operatic"" De Palma only appears when the audience is introduced to corrupt and opulent characters. When the villain delivers her monologue, De Palma frames her on a balcony, flanked by red curtains and lit like an opera singer. Here De Palma's previously subdued camera suddenly goes baroque, linking hypocrisy with theatricality and Hollywood itself. In De Palma's world the image, the performance, is always a lie.A brilliant crane shot at a street junction signals the point at which the film's two mysteries split apart and veer in different directions. Interestingly, both mysteries are solved, but neither is resolved. And in typical De Palma fashion, the film's chief murder is itself an image, both a work of art and a cry for help. We're always aware that the film's two murderers, grotesque and scarred, were themselves the monstrous product or ugly underside of a kind of ""beautiful"", legitimized victimization.""Dahlia"" eventually becomes De Palma's personal statement about the dark heart of Hollywoodland, a place the director has always approached with apprehension. ""Are you capable of playing sadness,"" De Palma, playing a casting director in the film, asks Elizabeth Short, the line echoing Swan's request in ""Phantom of Paradise"" (""Would you give me your voice?""). What Swan takes in ""Paradise"", Hollywood exploits naturally whilst pretending to be ""paradise"". De Palma sees this clearly, and his noir protagonist (Josh Hartnett) will come to see this as well. Hartnett, himself a clueless actor, is thus cast to perfection. Hardly a Bogart, he's a well-meaning but severely deluded gumshoe. He takes the fall in a boxing match, and is constantly belittling himself via voice over.This uselessness, this futility, continues when Betty starts flirting with De Palma during an audition (he mocks her for recounting a story about her dream boyfriend, who ironically then dies). As we watch more and more of Betty's screen tests, we see her grow more and more disenchanted, echoing De Palma's own experience within the Hollywood machine. Even before she died, Betty's fairytale had become a broken dream.Many are dissatisfied with the film's ""love triangle"", which isn't sexually charged and lacks the chemistry of a Bogey and Bacall. But there's intentionally no ""heat"" or ""sexuality"" in this film. When we finally do see actress Scarlett Johansson strip, it's only so the audience can view the past scars etched horrendously into her body by an ex boyfriend. There are only wounds in this film, and so much of the emotion ""Dahlia"" generates relies on the audience tapping into its sad, wounded world.As Bucky states, a ""fairytale band-aid"" covers everything, even the relationships in the film. All the character's lead fractured lives, even De Palma, who mirrors himself by playing the cynical director of the screen tests, even while his work of art aligns itself firmly with Betty's torment.9/10 - Though the studio chopped an hour off De Palma's original 3 hour cut, ""Dahlia"" rewards repeat viewings and may be De Palma's best.

I'm a big film noir buff, I like Aaron Eckhart, I'm always impressed when a movie does so well in capturing a time and place, but this movie is a total failure. De Palma is such a talented director. Even his ""flops"" are at least interesting. When the film became obvious that it wasn't really about the Black Dahlia murder, and was really about the stories of the investigators, I lost interest. It's rarely I even think about walking out of a movie, and I nearly did on this one. Josh Hartnett was such an inappropriate lead. His character should have been played by someone like Russell Crowe. Someone who's not a prettyboy. Someone who I could believe was a tough, seasoned LA cop who's seen it all.",The Black Dahlia

This is an alarmingly awful film! I'm usually someone who can tolerate less than terrific films but this was a slow, painful experience. I haven't read the original novel but I wish I had because I was utterly lost throughout most of the film in terms of understanding the characters, the roles they played and their motivation. Josh Hartnett's performance was weak and insipid. In fact, I didn't see one strong performance from any of the cast; not even from two-time Oscar winner Hilary Swank! Her accent which I think was supposed to be 1940's ""Posh American"" was inconsistent and laughable at times. There was far too much voice-over narration from Josh Hartnett's character which to me is often the hallmark of shoddy film-making! The story had to be spelled out verbally for the audience at the end of the film! There wasn't one segment of this film that mildly impressed me.

The Movie follows the same Storyline and has many vital moments but, doesn't always stick to the buck. For example, in the book Lee had won the slow dance with Kay. However, in the movie it shows Kay dancing with Bucky. The movie lacks many details of Bucky's Father and while it is mainly about the Black Dahlia, Universal could have included some more content from the book. (Prior to the Black Dahlia case, Bucky and Lee played Russian Roulette with a dog in order to get info) Honestly, this isn't a bad movie, it just needs some more work and it would be great.

Oh no, no...the writer didn't do the film justice for how BAD it was. It's actually borderline un-watchable. I actually spent the last half of the movie staring at my cell phone waiting for the time to pass. The movie doesn't even have corny enough lines to make it that funny. The movie would have been much more accurately titled ""Josh Harnett has lots of sex in the 1940s...and some people die"" (is that really a spoiler?).

596,Rocket6240,"Not just disappointing, one of the worst of the year.",2,17 September 2006,"I think I speak for a lot of people when I say I was looking forward to this movie. A lot. From the preview, and some early reviews, I was fairly convinced that it could've been one of the best of the year. Maybe these lofty expectations were part of the reason this movie was such a stunning disappointment.First off, Josh Hartnett is woefully miscast. I didn't need to hear his lifeless drone narrate a 2 hours of movie, but I got it anyway. Most of the cast is miscast for that matter. Especially Patrick Fischler as DA Ellis Lowe. He's far too wimpy to hold the part. Perhaps too, this suffers from comparisons to Ron Rifkin's excellent performance as Ellis Lowe in L.A. Confidential. That's just an example. But my WTF vote goes to Fiona Shaw, who I thought was Molly Shannon at first because she was ridiculously hamming up the booze hound socialite Ramona Linscott. One of the reviews here called her performance genius, it was the most grating performance in a film full of grating performances.Now, this would pass if the movie had something to do with solving the Black Dahlia murder, and the case was engaging in some way. But this movie's got two hours to solve it, why rush? The result: extreme boredom. All the pieces are just put in place for the final revelatory scenes where the red herring is confronted, the real killer is discovered, and the political motivations are untangled. Sort of. The characters are just caught up in happenings that they don't understand, and neither do we. And when the dust settles, the movie's not even about Elizabeth Short, it's more of a pity party for Bucky Bleichart's fractured and confused life.In the movie's defense, some of the cinematography and sets are very beautiful, and do entice some comparisons to the noir-era. However, this is marred by the jump-and-cut editing style, and the lack of central focus of the film. I was just too confused to care.If I could give you one visual representation of how this film struck me it would be this: it's that mass of hair that clogs your drain. Avoid this movie, no matter how promising the previews looked.",The Black Dahlia
597,neo_42102,"Visually good, but an overall wash and another disappointment from DePalma",6,17 September 2006,"Saw it. Good visual style aside, I thought the movie was a complete wash. The actors looked like they were doing a high school play production based off of 1940s film noirs as opposed to a noir itself. The scene in which Hartnett and Johannsen go at it was so unintentionally funny it was amazing. The story was pretty true to the book for the first half, but once it got to the second half, it practically cut a whole story out, not to mention lots of important character background for Bleichart and his motives. SPOILER ALERT!!!In the book:Blanchard has his breakdown after the Nash incident, and once Bobby Dewitt is released, he disappears completely. DeWitt is found dead, and Bleichart pulls some insubordination tactics that get him bussed back down to uniform beat cop. Bleichart decides to track Blanchard with some ""vacation time"", and uses a lead in the Dahlia case that takes him to Tijuana, NM. Bleichart trailing Blanchard is almost a story in and of itself, as he goes from point A to point B and then learns that Blanchard was murdered by a gang in TJ. He finds Blanchard's body buried on a beach with a lot of other stiffs that have caused problems for the local ganglords. He goes back to LA, marries Kay after they both grieve the loss of Blanchard, and they live happily for some time. However, Bleichart soon falls back in with Madeleine and then learns of Blanchard's shady dealings and of course gets ticked at Kay for being so secretive. However, since he still feels a sense of honor to the man, he decides to stay on the Dahlia case on his own, which leads him to Boston for a short period of time. He then returns and finds Madeleine with Emmet and learns of the taxidermist, whom they both believe is the killer. Bleichart goes to the murder scene, and finds and kills the taxidermist who puts up quite a fight. The scene with Ramona is done almost matter of factly with just she and Bleichart talking about how he made the connection with the paintings. Her dialogue about the slaying is cool and collected, not over the top as in the movie. He just leaves knowing what has happened but powerless to do anything against the socially elite. Eventually, she kills herself in passing, and Bleichart, determined not to let Betty Short die again (he sees Madeleine as a second version of her), saves Madeleine from a potentially killer client. Bleichart loses his place on the force and Madeleine goes to an insane home to treat multiple personality disorder (this was what explained her crazy accents and such in the book, in the movie she just comes across as goofy). Bleichart has long since split with Kay at this point, and learns that she has taken a teaching job in Boston. The book ends with him traveling there to maybe make amends. The movie: Opts to have Blanchard get killed in front of Bleichart right on the heels of the DeWitt murder in what seems like an attempt to just have a trademark DePalma slow mo scene and to set up a twist with Hillary Swank as his killer. Also of note is that they conveniently offed the taxidermist in the same scene. Also, the scene where Ramona does her crazy confession to everyone before offing herself was about as clichéd an approach to a climax one could take. I think DePalma knew this and that was why he felt the need to throw in the whole twist of Madeleine offing Blanchard. END SPOILERS!!!!Basically, it seems the screenwriter was trying to faithfully adapt and then realized how much was left to be written at the halfway point, and just created a way to conveniently have everything fit together, even if some of it didn't really make sense and looked haphazardly put together and contrived. Also, once again DePalma shows that his only talent is that he can just ape the style of something else. Granted, the style was good to look at it, but it totally lacks originality. I agree, it's time for this guy to retire.",The Black Dahlia

600,celticleofire,Big Disappointment,3,26 September 2006,"What a let down.For anyone who viewed and got excited by the trailer, do yourself a favor and wait to watch it on video. Or just don't watch it at all. This film is another unfortunate case of the trailer being better than the actual film. When I saw the trailer, the music, the shots, the way it was cut, it all gave me chills. When I walked out of the theater, two hours and fifteen minutes older, I was sorely disappointed.To start off, the title is misleading. More accurately, the title should have been ""Those Invesitgating the Black Dahlia"". The actual events surrounding the gruesomely fascinating true story are a mere footnote to the plot, whose details are all crammed in during the last 20 minutes. Far too much time is wasted on the sub-plots and sub-sub-plots that there isn't any time to focus on the actual events that the film is supposed to illustrate. We don't care that the detectives were both former boxers. We don't care that they have some ambiguous brotherly rivalry. We don't care about the love triangles. We just don't care. Give us the mystery surrounding the murder, and the reasons why it became such a pop phenomenon. Show more of the stress and madness the detectives are facing as they become obsessed with the macabre. It's supposed to be Noir - give us the darkness! It seems that De Palma, though appreciatively recalling certain characteristics that films of the era possessed, fails to take into consideration that the audiences are not those of the past. Campy music, out-dated camera angles and over the top scenes just don't cut it anymore. It also seems to me that he simply shot on the wrong kind of film, or processed the film wrong. Everything was too bright, too vivid to reflect the nature of the film. I wanted to see more muted tones, more smokiness. There's a reason that, cinematically, films of today are superior in tone to those of the past - it's evolved! The acting, however, was not so bad. Hilary Swank has yet to disappoint me. Aaron Eckhart and Josh Hartnett did their best. Scarlett Johanssen was fine, though I fear she is letting the limelight affect her acting. Now that she's ""made it"" she seems to be falling into that familiar trap where once talented actors simply stop acting well (see Ben Affleck, Julia Roberts, Angelina Jolie, et al). The true gem of the film, however, is Fiona Shaw. As Hilary Swanks mother (and, as it turns out, the crazed killer) she is brilliant - it's a shame she doesn't get more work in film. Mia Kirshner as the titular victim is also quite haunting in her moments of flashback. It's just a shame De Palma spent too much time on quirks and not enough on actual direction.So don't waste your ten dollars for price of admission on this one (and they wonder why people don't go to the movies anymore).

Hopefully it will gain the camp appeal of those two films, because I haven't laughed and mimicked scenes (for comic relief) from a movie in a long time...but this one broke that dry spell. Scarlett J. and Aaron Eckhart are absolutely over-the-top hilarious. The plot is completely muddled and makes no sense what-so-ever. I don't mind that they scrapped almost all of the actual case history surrounding the Betty Short murder- if they where trying to make a statement about something (for example Son of Sam, which I loved). But that story line seemed completely tacked on and didn't seem to ground any of the highly strange emotional responses exhibited by the characters. The ending is pure slapstick straight from the movie Clue...Wait! No, I did it with the candlestick. Check it out to see how bad pulp can be, and everything Noir shouldn't.

Why Hartnett? Did Hillary Swank just watch loony tunes to pull off her accent? This movie is rape with a camera. About the only passable thing is the loony mother, but in the end they ruin that too. Don't go see this...if somebody tells you this movie is good, punch them in the throat.",The Black Dahlia
605,chiosus,Very disappointing,4,15 September 2006,"I was so disappointed! I had been waiting to see this film for so long, and I think I expected something totally different. I thought the acting was over-the-top and too exaggerated, for example, the swell of 'sexy' 40's era music that played every time Scarlett Johanssen appeared in a scene. Granted, Scarlett was BEAUTIFUL in this movie, she's such a classic beauty, an she was perfect for the time period. However, whenever there was a serious/suspenseful information-revealing type of moment in the movie, the camera would linger on her face for ages while Scarlett's eyebrows furrowed and lips quivered while we waited for her to give a breathless answer of some sort. The love scenes couldn't have had less chemistry, with their contrived spontaneity, and clumsy ripping-off of clothing, and the constant comparison of Hillary Swank's character and Mia Kirshner's character who were supposed to bear an uncanny resemblance to each other in the film, when in reality they look absolutely nothing alike. Not to mention the confusing side crime story that I'm still attempting to decipher three hours after seeing the movie. I will say that the cinematography was great, and the costuming was perfect. But, I was very disappointed with the film in its entirety.",The Black Dahlia
606,wtrmn,Terrible! Trys to hard for noir,2,14 October 2006,"This movie was AWFUL! It tried way to hard to be ""film noir"" which I am a huge fan of. It was to the point that if it tried just a little harder it would have been a comedy/take-off/farce of film noir. The acting was poor, the plot convoluted and the cinematography was mediocre. Too much of the plot was about everything BUT Elizabeth Short. Hmmmm...just like Pearl Harbor was about everything but Pearl Harbor. Must be a Josh Hartnett thing. If you want to see a newly made INTERESTING film noir go rent ""BRICK"" or see an old Humphrey Bogart flick. My first clue should have been that there were only two there people in the entire theater. I guess or area isn't great for good films. HAVEN was only in a theater here for one week. Looked good but I won't get to see it until it's on video.",The Black Dahlia
607,ewdot2480,Could have been one of the greats ... poor directing.,7,19 September 2006,"The title of this film really needed to be 'Fire & Ice' (the original title). 'Fire and 'Ice' are the nicknames of Lee and Bucky, the men at the center of the movie. This was their story, not Elizabeth Shorts. By naming the film 'The Black Dahlia', and leading the public (through many trailers and commercial spots) to believe that the film focuses squarely on Elizabeth Short's untimely death ... a huge disservice was given to us. I enjoyed the story surrounding Lee and Bucky. But I spent way too much time and energy trying to figure out how and when the 'Black Dahlia' part of the story would take hold.Also, why did De Palma try to show this film AS a 1940's flick, instead of trying to emulate a 1940's mood? Every aspect of direction, acting, set design, cinematography, climax, film noir, etc. appeared goofy and overdone. Throw in the absolutely atrocious musical score you've got a movie that is hard to take seriously. I really feel that with a completely different musical score that veered from 1940's trumpets and focused on real tension and drama ... we wouldn't have been subjected to such unbelievable 'melo'drama.This movie had everything in it to be great. The cast selection was stellar. The novel from which the movie was based provided so much potential for epic noir film-making. While last week's Hollywoodland bored me, I can now appreciate the finish and polish that 'The Black Dahlia' lacked so much of. The way in which the story was told, and how it was executed is it's ultimate downfall; a real shame. I liked various parts of this film, but they were few and far between. With a different director and other tactical changes to plot ... this could have been one for the ages",The Black Dahlia
608,remy_sisk,"A little slow, but picks up",7,7 November 2006,"Based on true events, the haunting murder mystery, The Black Dahlia, leaves the audience disturbed and thoughtful. The story is advertised as a thrilling murder-mystery, centered on a grotesquely mutilated and murdered Hollywood starlet. However, it is actually focused on the relationship between the two detectives investigating her murder. The primary character, Hartnett, is simply mediocre. It is nearly impossible to believe that Josh Hartnett's character used to be a boxing champion and is now a cop. His lackluster monologues delivered to the audience with little emotion are rather pathetic. His equally plain partner, Eckhart, does little to impress us. Following the downward trend of leads is Scarlett Johanssen, who attempts a role to big for her acting level. As she pretends to be frustrated over her love triangle with Hartnett and Eckhart, she wears out the audience with her obviously forced tears. Hillary Swank completely turns the film around. She stars as a bisexual, sultry seductress identical to the murder victim. As she captivates you with her mystery and superiority, one cannot help but wonder what the secret is she tries to hide throughout the film. Nearly halfway through the movie, the actual story begins. After extensive and unnecessary character setup, the body of Elizabeth Short, the Black Dahlia, is suddenly discovered. Called the Black Dahlia because of her tendency to always wear elaborate black dresses, Elizabeth Short's body is discovered to have *minor, minor, minor spoiler*two broken knees, a hole through her right hand, a laceration form ear to ear, a body cut in half, removed organs and drained blood.*spoiler end*The gruesome corpse is hardly pleasing to the eyes but it is necessary in the story. Short, played by the superb Mia Krishner, was an upcoming movie star until her untimely murder. Possibly the best parts of the film are Short's screen tests, which are being used in the investigation. Krishner lures you into her haunting eyes as you watch her audition for a Hollywood film. Her all too brief role is destroyed when you here the monotonous sound of Josh Hartnett's voice. The style of the film is entirely dated. From the gritty, purposeful sound to the out of date scene transitions, you are completely immersed into the world of 1940s Hollywood. Though it does include some gratuitous nudity, language and violence, its essence is disturbing and provocative and you can't help but enjoy it. Although it does start slow, it finally picks up the pace near the end, leaving you with your heart pounding. After one last seeing of Mia Krishner's chilling eyes, you will be left thoughtful and mesmerized.",The Black Dahlia
609,sensational17,Now where were we.,4,16 September 2006,"I just got back from seeing The Black Dahlia, and I got one thing to say. I am glad I read the book.First off the book is far superior than the movie. Ellroy, the author, uses a style of hard nosed and slick words that intertwine with each other moving from point a to b to c to d. His descriptions are so well crafted that the scenes and character come to life for you. The movie on the other hand is a chopped up story that moves to point b to d to z.The adaption is horrible. It just doesn't work for the movie. The parts of Lee and Bucky's relationship is diluted and you never experience what make these two one. But, that was the problem throughout the movie. It had no character development, and that could be due in large part to no plot development.The Dahlia story is picked up on 20 minutes to the movie and is never really seen again until the very end. There is no road that leads from point a to b, instead you are teleporting from a to b, and not knowing what happened in between. The Lee sub story, is the same way. You never really have a clue what is going on.I read the book, and if it wasn't for that I would be very confused as to why the characters did what they said they did. Yet again pulling into the whole no story or character development.Now on to the acting. Could it get any worse? Hartnetts little cry stints had me laughing until he stopped. You know what was so sad Josh? Your acting. The rest of the crew I didn't mind too much, but that is probably because I never cared for their characters. AND DON'T, DO NOT get me started on Hilary Swank. She was the worst of them all. Go accent or go home. The character was supposed to have a Irish accent, Swank tried it, occasionally. Going to a heavy horrible accent, to a no accent, to a decent accent, to a heavy horrible accent to no accent at all. It was pitiful.To tell you the truth I didn't really mind the camera, but it was probably because that was the only part of the movie that wasn't so terrible.Save the money, buy the book. Enjoy.The Black Dahlia 4/10",The Black Dahlia
610,letitbebroke38,A movie that does not know what it is,4,23 September 2006,"Watching the Black Dahlia was not only confusing, but frustrating as well. If this was supposed to be an homage to old LA film noir, why didn't it LOOK like an homage to LA film noir? It has the cars, the clothes, the cigarettes, but yet is so overly stylized and so slick I almost felt like I was watching ""Sin City"" - except, you know, it wasn't good. The premise is simple, but apparently it would be too much to stick with that alone. The film meanders down so many tangential sub-plots that the viewer loses track of what it's even about. Is it a boxing movie? Another ""buddy"" cop film? A movie about forbidden romance with the best friend's woman? Is it the story of a common policeman struggling to break from the shackles of his middle-class roots for true love? The dilemma is that it is ALL these things, and yet it was somehow strongly reminiscent of ""8mm"" - but again, it wasn't good. Watching ""The Black Dahlia"" is comparable to peering down a sink drain to find out what's clogging it up, and quite frankly you'd rather not know what sort of things are in the sticky, convoluted mess of toothpaste, hair, and all-around mediocre film-making.",The Black Dahlia
611,frugalwitch,Look alike?? In a pig's eye,2,23 January 2007,"Thank God for Netflix, if I had paid full price at the theatre I'd been demanding a full refund. There is something perversely odd in taking a fascinating subject (the real murder) and rendering it completely devoid of interest.If one is going to hang a major portion of plot on 2 people looking alike....wouldn't common-sense say cast 2 people who actually look alike? Or double cast one actress in both parts? Why oh why was Hilary Swank in this movie?? Normally I like Ms Swank, but she was awful in this....her acting was on the level of really bad high-school production. Oh, and she looked nothing like the other character she was supposed to look like.The only decent thing about this movie was when the focus was on Elizabeth Short (The Black Dahlia), the actress Mia was truly wonderful. Shame she was wasted on this piece of crap.",The Black Dahlia
612,sburger-3,Appalling,2,19 September 2006,"This movie is another example of Hollywood exploiting a true event and a real victim. This movie had NOTHING to do with the murder of Elizabeth Short. It doesn't pose any reasonable explanation of the actual murder and is insulting to the victim.Further, after the first hour, you will be begging the movie to end. When it does, you will be left with a conclusion that is illogical and pointless.Although there are many competent actors, this movie definitely brings out their absolute worst. The audience I watched with was constantly laughing at awkward lines and acting that seems to at times have been read off of a piece of paper.",The Black Dahlia
613,justdani23,Dahlia in Question,5,22 September 2006,"With the recent release of Hollywoodland paired with Black Dahlia, one expects that crime dramas fueled by the Golden Age of the silver screen to be making a comeback.Unfortunately for audience viewers, Black Dahlia is a disappointing tribute to Hollywood's glory days in both plot and execution, pardon the pun.The trailers and teasers entice the viewer with risqué clips and an intriguing plot line: Hollywood's most infamous murder. (Although, well-informed viewers will question the authenticity of that claim with Hollowoodland also staking the title of Hollywood's most notorious unsolved crime.) But after a few minutes in the movie theater, you can see that the plot of Black Dahlia is more dismembered than the crime's victim.The film-makers gallantly attempted to recreate the feel of 40's or 50's cinema within this movie, even pinning Scarlett Johansson as a busty blonde almost reflective of an early Marilyn Monroe. While successful in their ""period"" efforts, splashes of grizzly violence and bits of racy sex distort their noble goal. As an audience member I got the feeling that this would be what Quentin Tarantino would have made were he a director in 1946. Authentic in it's nostalgia, but disturbing in it's content.Also unsettling is the film's almost-accurate time setting. I feel that details make any period film, and that mistakes can often hurt the feel. ""Goofs"" like the barcode on the bottom of the evidence box that Rusty carries from the father's apartment (barcodes were not patented until 1952) and several of the historical details in costuming somewhat distort the overall feel. This is, however, coming from a perfectionist, and should not warp the average viewer's movie-going experience.The evolvement of the plot, however, will warp the experience. Most confusing to me was the use of nick names during fast-paced dialogue scenes. Characters would change Betty to Elizabeth and Madeline to Manny faster than you could decipher the Irish accents or bits of Hartnett's narration.See this movie if you want to be disturbed, otherwise, wait until you can rent it so that you can pause and ponder. Perhaps then this film, with it's ins-and-outs of twisting plot line, will all make sense.",The Black Dahlia
614,ricardo-128,"Left me thinking ""huh?""",2,2 October 2006,"For a movie titled, and billed to be about the Black Dahlia murder, most of the movie didn't seem to have anything to do with the murder or the investigation. So many different story lines were introduced and dwelled upon, then as if they suddenly remembered the title, they tried to tie all the subplots back together about as neatly as a square peg fits into a round hole.One of the things that really bothered me was that they never gave a clear explanation why Aaron Eckhart's character was so obsessed with the Dahlia.I am not a tough movie critic, I am easily entertained, but I do not need to be spoon fed. As long as the movie is entertaining, thought provoking, or both, I'm happy. This movie left me scratching my head and thinking ""huh""?",The Black Dahlia
615,srvngfrnd,lazy interpretation of the novel.,3,19 September 2006,"I don't like writing reviews of movies, but this movie annoyed me so much I had to vent. The excellent Ellroy novel is a twisting, gritty portrayal of a descent into madness. Plenty of potential for an excellent psychological thriller there. Unfortunately, this movie is Hartnett looking handsome, Eckhart girning confusingly, and not much else.One of the problems stems from the apparent difficulty the writer encountered of translating the novel to film. Ellroy's novel is told in first person with lots of intertwining, ambiguous subplots. The filmmakers seemed to decide to just throw a bunch of plot points from the novel up there with little thought for storytelling or character development, resulting in an incoherent mess. Some changes to the main plot were made for no apparent reason, yet less important subplots were replicated exactly, in an over-compressed fashion. The novel takes place over a much longer time-frame than the movie seems to, which is fine if you don't then try to cram in as much of the novel as the screenwriter has done here. Despite having read and loved the book, i was confused a couple of times during the movie - heaven knows what someone who hadn't read it would think.More critically, de Palma's direction is uninspired. It has all the hackneyed devices: disembodied voices of characters repeating important lines later on, to emphasise a plot point that the audience seemingly would otherwise not grasp; flashbacks; loud jumpy bits. All typical shortcuts found in lazy interpretations of novels. Everything looks too glamorous and glossy too, at least based on my reading of the novel. For example, KD Lang performs a hugely elaborate 'sexy' musical number in a fancy upper-class lesbian bar (did such things exist in 1947?), which is both totally against the tone of the novel and in any case, utterly laughable. It reminded me of that one scene in Blazin' Saddles.There are even some rather baffling mistakes left in the film - at one point when i saw it there seemed to be glitch in the soundtrack as Hillary Swank's Scottish father was speaking. This glitch in the soundtrack resulted in him suddenly having an English accent for 4 words mid-sentence! I can only assume this was an editing mistake, perhaps using a previous take, but it seems incredibly lazy that no one bothered to fix it.The acting all round is poor - Josh Hartnett is seemingly capable of two expressions - vacant confusion and vacant anger, which he moderates by varying the angle of his eyebrows. The Bleichert character in the novel constantly endures all sorts of emotional trauma, which leads to his own eventual obsession and madness. Hartnett plays the character as a generic (unconvincing) bad-ass, whose response to all of this is to look a bit annoyed, or at one point, mildly surprised! Johansson, an actress I like, does little more than have large breasts and stare blankly. Eckhart struggles with limited screen time - in the novel his character is complex and actually develops, whereas in the film he seems to have been written to instantly become 'obsessive angry workaholic guy' as soon as the body is found.Finally, after seemingly interminable hours of clunky exposition, the film comes to a hurriedly explained and unsatisfying conclusion. Much like my review! In other words, read the book, watch the movie afterwards and wonder why so little effort was put into it.",The Black Dahlia
616,mvwhollywood,Even The Dead Are Laughing,1,18 September 2006,"The ""new shell game"" is called ""The Black Dahlia"", it gives you that ""ripped off"" feeling all over. Somewhere in this film there is a woman called the ""Black Dahlia"", however, you won't find out much about her. Instead you are fed laughable scenes posed as serious drama. Once the laughing starts you feel sorry for the talented actors on screen, forever trapped in a maze of flickering celluloid against a wall of dead news print; news print where anything about Elizabeth Short, the victim, is lost and now recycled into the comic section, not worthy of wrapping the day's garbage. Your mind wanders with hopes of Woody Allen's ""Purple Rose of Cairo"" coming to the rescue, making it possible for all the actors to leave the screen and go out for a night on the town. The dead are laughing too, because they're dead and happy not to be in this film. It's an insult to ""Film Noir"" artists everywhere, dead or alive. The narrative is not clever enough to be classified as ""Film Noir""; nor does it begin touch the greats, such as, Raymond Chandler, James M. Cain, and Dashiell Hammett who understood the power of irony and cynicism. Filmgoers deserve a public apology spread across tomorrow's headlines.",The Black Dahlia
617,rwoods133,so-so thriller,2,15 September 2006,"Although I have never read Ellroy's book, I found this film to be a dreadful telling of the 1947 murder of Elizabeth Smart. To start off, while the film is visually stunning,the story is convoluted in its telling and the actors are uneven in performance. The best acting in this film belongs to Mia Kirshner as the Dahlia and Fiona Shaw as the ghoulish doyenne of a rich family;whereas, Hartnett is too wooden in his performance while other leads barely register. My basic beef with this film is that the (in)famous LA murder ( which I have read plenty of in my 60 years of life ) is the background fodder for what is basically a noir - story of romance and adultery in 40s LA. The lesbian club scene sets the ""over-the - top"" tone that permeates this film and culminates in Shaw's dinner table antics.",The Black Dahlia

Its the first movie I've ever walked out of in my 40 years on this planet. Still a fan of Elroy, but I'LED rather shove glass shards into my eyes and groin than see another Depalma movie.It couldn't be funny enough. It couldn't be overacted enough. It couldn't be titillating enough. It couldn't be gritty enough. It couldn't be noirish enough. It half-assed its way through EVERY single genre it tried to parody or pay homage to. I left an hour and a half in, and now knowing that it lasted in excess of two hours, I am so happy with my decision.But I have a question for any legal types that might read this: Doesn't USC 2257 (the Child Porn Act) prohibit not only people under the age of 18 from performing in porn OR naked, but also actors portraying characters under the age of 18 from the same?

This movie could have soared but failed to even take flight.Most disappointing was Mia Kirshner's ""performance"" I've seen that actress cry more than I can stomach. Her eyes must have some kind of loose or malfunctioning tear duct system. Her work as Jenny Shector on Showtime's ""The L-word"" is even more painful to watch than this role..(Believe it or not) I was excited to see her outside of the TV drama, in hopes that she would impress, but as expected she failed. Over the Top, Mellow dramatic mess.Hartnett, Eckhart and Johansson were all three unbelievable in their roles. I was instantly bored with Harnett. Teen Dramas are more his style..less depth to his characters seems to work well for him.Johansson while usually remarkable fell short. Phony accent topped off with really bad dialogue made for painful screen time.Speaking of phony accent..Hillary Swank, What was she trying to do? Where was she from again ""Irengland""? She fell in and out of her created accent all throughout the film. While Swank is a fantastically gorgeous actress, her ability to play the ""sex kitten"" is really non existent. I was not convinced at all. Really just dreadful.I'm severally disappointed with this film. I had high hopes.

To which he replied 'no!'. This basically sums up the film. Whether you choose to blame the screenwriter, the actors or the director, somewhere along the way something went horribly wrong! Many parts of this film seem irrelevant to the storyline. The character of Aaron Eckhart is missing for the majority of the film leaving you little time to connect to him. Scarlett Johansson's acting leaves a lot to be desired. However I believe she, along with the rest of the cast, struggled with the terrible dialogue put before them. Although I am not a fan of Josh Hartnett I thought he was quite good in Lucky Number Slevin...although after watching this I have to revert back to my original opinion.I won't give too much of the plot away, mainly because I didn't think there was one. There are too many tangents and irrelevant stories in this movie that make you leave the cinema wondering, 'what was that part about?'. At the end of the movie when the story is supposed fit into place and mysteries are revealed it does not have the desired effect for a few reasons; a) you have forgotten most of the characters names referred to due to boredom, and b) you just don't care.A waste of time and money, please think twice before seeing, there are better films on at the cinema...like...Garfield 2...Yes, it's that bad!",The Black Dahlia
622,chacowalla,"Disappointing as a movie, but had some great sets",4,30 December 2006,"I had high hopes for this movie, but it turned pretty much into a disappointment. The sets were great tho (where did they get the styled wall papers?) and was that what the California flag at the time actually looked like in the police squad room? I was so curious about these things they grabbed all the attention away from the plot (if there was one). Scarlette Johanseen and Hilary Swank's considerable talents were wasted. The male leads were wooden; there were plot lines that were given lots of loving care and developed in detail, and then they were dropped and never heard of again... I thought I had read and enjoyed Elroy's book (I'm a big fan), but I sure don't remember it being like this movie, so am going to have to find it and reread. It would be so cool if the next version of the film were based on the life of Dr. Hodel (as the Black Dahlia killer) -- there is a gripping book by his son, a retired LA cop, who came to the conclusion his dad is the Black Dahlia killer. Dr.Hodel was a medical doctor who worked for LA county, was in tight with the police and well acquainted with underground life (allegedly performed abortions for pregnant hookers, entertained his male friends with his under aged daughter and also had an incestuous relationship with her for which he got into a lot of trouble with the law). He saw himself as a kind of ""ubermensch"" above the laws that ordinary people follow. He also was a friend to a lot of artists and bohemian types, one of whom,Man Ray, was one of the ""fathers"" of Dadaism. The dismembered female body is pictured in a lot of the surrealist and Dada works of art and there is a very interesting book just recently out about this subject. ...anyway, this movie could have been a lot better than it was. A couple of the people who have written in to comment on the movie hit the nail on the head and I agree with them that most likely the main problem with the movie was that because facts are known about Elizabeth Short's murder, the story is so well known, and continues to this day to be such a mystery, it feels like we have been cheated by this movie since it has so little of the Black Dahila story we know.

This movie is not good enough to be a tribute to the noir genre, nor entertaining enough to be a satire. DePalma's ham-handedness ruins whatever merit the scatter-shot script may have held.

So I even contented to not seeing the latest football game of the national team (which was scheduled for the same hour in the evening) and headed to the cinema. The food there was great, drinks were pretty decent too. The organizers had even invited the American ambassador, who put out a speech on how nice it is to have a movie shot in Bulgaria with US capital"". The culmination of the evening were some swing dancers from neighboring Greece. And then came the disastrous downfall called Black Dahlia. The screenplay was awful, the actors performed with the charisma of 10-year-olds who are trying to sell you a box of really bad tasting cookies. The sets were a laugh, too. Eckhart tried to resemble early Peter Fonda, but sucked at it. Hartnett's performance was identical to Lucky Number Slevin. I became a big fan of Johansson after Lost In Translation, but here she was definitely out of place, not to mention how immaturely she acted (oops, I mentioned that already).

I couldn't work up any interest in what was happening regarding the story or characters.

The only other positive I can say is that it was great to hear/see k.d.lange sing and Mia Kirshner's Dahlia conveyed the inner sadness of her character very well.

I focus on the positive things - I like the costumes, the old cars and the way people were back then, but the story line left me wondering ""what is this movie about?"". It was not about the horrific murder of the lady, or about her life at all, other than the few tawdry trash scenes (the porno film) depicting her trying to survive from one day to the next.",The Black Dahlia
629,freerythm33,"Twisted, and Brutally Amazing",9,17 September 2006,"Amazing...dark... It's film noir... Great set, acting, and the shots at the end, with the slitting of the face... Albert Hitchcock would have been proud!!! Yes, the plot did have A LOT of little facets, and it left you hungry, but isn't that a good thing? It will make you want to look up the 'real' story... Finally a decent movie... The new directors SUCK!! Two thumbs up for me!!! In detail: Josh Harnett and Aaron Eckhart were very very good! Real, believable, played their parts flawlessly! But, the femme fatale Hilary Swank was AMAZING! AND SO WAS HER MOM(Although it looked like she had a stroke) Visual shots were a little tenuous at times, but the last 20 minutes, during and after the 'resurrection,' ""Wow!!!"" 20 minutes, non-stop in-your-face real world grit! De Palma knows his stuff",The Black Dahlia
630,technicolortami,Perhaps the writers of 'Dahlia' expected viewers to think too much...,8,28 June 2007,"I recently purchased 'The Black Dahlia' on DVD. As a child, I was enamored by the convoluted case of stunner Elizabeth Short! Her haunting beauty and the grisly pictures of her body seem burned into my memory, so I was excited to see this take on her case, even though I went into the viewing knowing that it had very little to do with the hard facts of the case.Contrary to many comments on here, I thoroughly enjoyed this film! Yes, it's got more than its share of plot points that are at first confusing, but if you take the time to watch this movie more than once, its not too difficult to figure out. Life is messy folks, and murder is messier. No one is just one thing in life, i.e. a detective, a kept woman, a rich brat. These characters have a few dimensions each, even if the explanations of those dimensions may be lacking. It drives home the point that we can only know the parts of people that they let us know.Visually, this film was positively breathtaking! All the sets were flawless, and even the scenes that took place outside were perfect. The grainy black and white film flashbacks, gritty police station offices, seedy motels, boxing ring and even the Linscott mansion were just amazing! The acting has taken quite a lot of criticism, and with good reason. Aaron Eckert's performance was one of the best of the film, as were the characters of Mr and Mrs Linscott. But Rose McGowan! Her performance stole the show for me, and it really is a shame that she had such a tiny role. She had the pouty-lipped sensuality, the verbal quickness, the attitude, everything a 40s actress should exude. She would have done much better in a more substantial role, Madeline Linscott for instance...Anyone would have been better than Hilary Swank in that role. She was simply dreadful, and looks not a thing like the Dahlia! I'm not a huge fan of Mia Kirshner, but I think she did well as Betty Short. She captured the softness and innocence of a girl who came to LA seeking stardom, and mixed it with vulnerability and heartache that hardens a person. Perhaps it is her limited screen time that keeps her performance effective...The scenes at the Linscott house were some of the creepiest I have ever seen on film! These people are creepier than the family in Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but they're rich and in LA! If I were Bucky, I would have been glad as hell that I had a sidearm at that dinner table! Some of the plot points are predictable, but I really enjoyed the dirty, gritty, corrupt world that this movie inhabits. I've heard many comparisons to 'LA Confidential' in these comments, and that film is exceptional, but to me it's no where near as dark as 'Dahlia'.",The Black Dahlia
631,guarapero2005,I liked it.,9,20 September 2006,"Some people go to the movies to lose themselves, to believe something.Since I am no longer 12, I like to go to the movies to watch movies, to watch them as movies, to lose myself in participating in the process, to be an active audience.I didn't want ""The Black Dahlia"" to end. It serves all the requisite purposes of film noir with all the traits of a Brian De Palma movie. I lapped it up like a kitten with a bowl of milk. I even licked the sides of the bowl. And the floor.This seems to be at great odds with the rest of the world. The comments from (mostly young) fans on the IMDb are withering, skewering every facet, every scene, every actor, but compared to what? I wonder. The flock of sorority girls sitting in the back of the theater left at the end, laughing and shaking their heads. They are so used to having everything handed to them on a plate. I savored everyone and everything, from Hilary Swank's Talullah accent to the crane shot over the parking lot, from Fiona Shaw's vaudeville comedy routine (the audience burst into laughter ) to pasty-faced k.d. lang's walk-on, or sing-on, in a Busby Berkeley moment, to the subdued violence that managed to be jarring by the fact of its rarity and judicious placement. I would say it is next to impossible for most directors to make jarring violence these days. Oh, they can make a lot of violence, gory as hell, but it's not the same.Narratively, films noir never make much sense. I don't see any point whatsoever nitpicking The Black Dahlia, unless that's one's means of participating in the movie. Someone said to me once, being a critic must be an odd profession. It used to me. Today, everyone thinks he is a ""critic,"" but he's really just a reviewer, looking for ways to paste a rating system on a film, like entering the numbers on a scoreboard at a junior high basketball game. They want to win, to be right, to argue and take sides. At least some directors and some artists continue to make movies for people like me, wherever we are, who like movies as movies, not donuts.",The Black Dahlia
632,danno50,"Nice photography, art deco sets and beautiful people.",5,12 February 2007,"I was a child when Elizabeth Short was murdered and I remember my mother, an avid detective magazine fan, talking of nothing else for months. This movie is a macrocosm of Hollywood: Small town girl goes to Hollywood hoping to be discovered; loses what's left of her innocence; and is brutally murdered. The writers dealt with the problem of writing a movie about an unsolved murder by writing about just about everything else. There are lots of shots of old LA buildings, landmarks and enough vintage automobiles to whet a collector's appetite. The spoilers for me in this movie were the out of place scenes of the characters attending a silent movie (two decades after the advent of talkies) and the earthquake scene wherein the entire room is shaken; but historically, it never happened. Call me old fashioned but if you're going to make a movie about an actual event - stick to the facts and let the characters inject the artistic license.",The Black Dahlia
633,philly_g,pretty much terrible,3,16 September 2006,"I was very excited for this film. I am a huge fan of josh, Scarlett and Hilary but holy mackerel...what a piece. the plot was tremendously hard to follow, i found myself asking what the name of that character was at least 25 times. is josh: Bucky, Dwight or Mr.ice...pick one name and stick it through. the movie probably would have been slightly better if it hadn't been SO long. there were some good moments near the beginning, middle and end but everything in all the extra space was slow to a point of almost falling asleep. there was a man in front of me who was. i would say that the only thing that brought this movie out of the gutter completely was Fiona shaw's performance. creepy to the level of laugh out loud. ""EMMMMITTTT!!!! SHUUUUUTTTT UPPPPP!!!!!"" ...epic. anyway, if you are looking for some good Josh Hartnett and you like the skin and violence...this isn't the film for you, rent sin city again. he is only on screen for about 6 minutes but it is far better than this load of cack.",The Black Dahlia
634,Mrobinson587,Nobody mentioned how gruesome...,4,16 September 2006,"Nobody seems to mention how gritty this movie is. There are some parts where it is absolutely shocking. I have seen gruesome movies and real videos online of people dying, getting hit by cars peoples bones popping out etc, but this movie left me with my mouth open. Some of the things the showed were unnecessary like showing the girl getting her mouth slit, a guy falling 60 feet to his death and his head exploding on the fountain top, the little kid with the bullet hole in his head...If you can get past that and keep up with a plot line where the information you receive comes in huge clumps, you might enjoy this movie. A great mystery movie that will leave you with you're jaw dropped. Camera shots lighting, music etc all superb. It has a few good quotes such as ""Good people the Germans, but Hitler was a bit excessive."" and some parts where you just have to laugh.",The Black Dahlia
635,kester-junk,This is a stinker,2,22 September 2006,"Was this movie meant to be campy or eerie, quirky or disturbing? It's certainly eerily quirky and disturbingly campy at times. The movement of the entire film and its characters is confused and plodding. The movie begins with a ""flashback"" of sorts that does a poor job of explaining anything. I struggled trying to determine who this movie was about: the Black Dahlia, or about one of the three main characters. I'm still not sure.Sadly, the Black Dahlia became nothing more than a footnote in this story. There was very little about her or even about the motivations of the detectives who apparently became obsessed with her case (or were they obsessed? I'm still not sure!).The best I can say for this film is the buildings chosen for the scenes were beautiful, and I enjoyed the costuming. If you like period films, that could be the best (and only?) plus. Oh, and the gratuitous nudity of some of the actors.",The Black Dahlia
636,wleblanc,what are you??,1,18 September 2006,"How is this movie currently sitting at a 6 on the rating scale and at #2 at the box office? This movie was unbearable. The acting would have been better if it had been done by sock puppets, the editing was right out of star wars, and the scenes were so disjointed from one another that the majority of the audience gave a collective ""huh?"" more than once during this film. And what was with the jump zooms? Only films like Kung Pow and Army of Darkness can pull those off because they are comedies. They add nothing to dramatic features other than unintentional hilarity.On the upside, it was photographed beautifully...well, it MOSTLY was photographed beautifully. Scarlett was kept in soft focus a lot on purpose, but there were other shots where I noticed other actors drifting as well. The lighting was nice though.Avoid this film like it was Ebola. You'll find yourself wanting your 10 bucks back after 10 minutes.",The Black Dahlia
637,ramar905,The Black Dahlia : Lurid Nonsense,1,16 September 2006,"The Black Dahlia is a lurid ridiculous nightmare. By using the term nightmare I am not implying that it an incongruous mess but rather that it is an unreal and disturbing visage. The entirety of the movie is an exposition of a mind gone to field on graphic violent sexual misogyny. The characters act in no way as real people might. Their realizations are cartoonish and have no resemblance to how real people act. The world that has been created is in no way as the the real world would be. Heavy dramatically convenient rains in Southern California, a police department that relies on a set of protocols and regulations that have no semblance to actual police work, politically charged boxing matches, insane morally vacant millionaires, sex films from the 40's with camera work and values from decades in the future, suicides and police shootouts and murders tossed aside without any consequence; these are all examples of story telling that just takes the audience for imbeciles. There is so much more that makes this reprehensible, Scarlett Johannson's lip-biting, Josh Harnett's tablecloth eschewing dining table sex romp, two cops in a hand-breaking bathroom roustabout, murderous knife wielding bisexuals doing business in vacant marble-lined halls and ice bag distributing mobsters, how thoughtful of them. This movie has no value other than camp and deserves righteous derision. If I brutally missed the point of this film then I am an idiot but anyone who goes to this movie expecting a thoughtful crime drama is best advised to readjust their perspective when viewing this hideous mess. This endeavor most reminds me of another nauseating exercise in audience bludgeoning, Mulholland Falls.",The Black Dahlia
638,oneprimalscream,"A little confusing, but all in all, a great movie.",9,16 September 2006,"Thought it was a great movie, but figured it would have focused more on the actual murder, rather than the other characters in the movie. Also thought it would go into much more detail about the actual murder scene and all that, and to be honest, any scenes with the corpse were not really that shocking. Another weird thing was that on all the photos on the wall, they used the actual morgue shot of Beth Short's face, which looked nothing like Mia Kirschner, so I didn't get why they just didn't put makeup on the actress and use a photo of her. Didn't make a lot of sense to use the real photo, in my opinion. The plot hopped around quite a bit and was a little confusing to follow all the names in the film, but all in all, I enjoyed the movie. It was a little slow-moving in some areas, but entertaining nonetheless. I really liked how the film was shot, and the wardrobe and everything seemed really authentic, and not modernized like most modern films that are supposed to take place in the 1940's.",The Black Dahlia
639,edchovsky,"Disjointed, tedious and dull.",1,21 September 2006,"Possibly the worst film I've ever had the misfortune to see. Am writing to the cinema to demand the 2hrs of my life back. Went with 4 friends and we all found it dire, the whole audience was stunned by the end, I've never seen so many glazed expressions. The plot is minimal and the (theoretical) basis of the film is lost with her being mentioned about three times. Predictably tedious ending, after many pseudo-endings (or perhaps it was just my wishful thinking). Occasional (very) humorous moments but totally wiped out by the sheer horror of the rest of it. Tedious, tedious, tedious :) And as for the Scottish accents, the guy appears to have com from somewhere between Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dublin with all too often slips out of accent. Looks like a poorly cut first edit. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!",The Black Dahlia
640,wpobuda,"Bad, bad, bad...",4,16 September 2006,"I was very disappointed in the movie as it had big star power and a potentially good story. But it seems like the director and editor got together with a pile of film and said, ""Well, let's try to salvage something out of this mess."" The plot was impossible to follow; Hilary Swank was laugh out loud trying to play her role as Kathryn Hepburn; Aaron Eckhart and Scarlet Johanssen were trying very hard but totally unbelievable. Josh Hartnett was the least offensive of the bunch.We did get a huge laugh out of Fiona Shaw's performance; if there was an award for the campiest performance of the year she should win.And as for the stuffed dog story.....pleeeese! Saw Hollywoodland the week before, much, much better movie.",The Black Dahlia
641,argentinexport,"If you are considering seeing this movie, please read.",1,18 September 2006,"I have to say I was so excited hearing that this movie was coming out. I've read ""The Black Dalhia"" and ""Black Dalhia Avenger"". Amazing books! Both were based on facts and some very probable theories. THIS wasn't based on much of anything. The director must be suffering from undiagnosed A.D.D. It was a mish-mash of different characters and how their lives are all connected to the Black Dalhia. But not in a way that would be believable or even possible. With an all star cast, it simply should have been better. The best actor in the entire film was the beautiful young lady that played Elizabeth Short, and she couldn't have had anymore than a total of 10 minutes of screen time in the entire film. There were huge lapses of time where the Black Dalhia wasn't even mentioned in the movie, because it seems like her story was thrown in halfway through the movie just to draw people in. The ending was too rushed and didn't make sense. Another contributor called it ""laughably bad"". Quite right. But I wasn't laughing. This was more like drawing scenes out of a hat and splicing them together. This is the first time that I heard everyone in the saying how bad it was as we were walking out of the movie. Don't waste your money!",The Black Dahlia
642,aussielife,So far from being black dahlia,1,23 March 2021,"Only accurate thing about this movie was the fake corpse they used, this just shows how Hollywood bends and fakes the truth, smears a victims name in smut to make themselves money. Should be ashamed of themselves",The Black Dahlia
643,legzk,Oh. Dear. Lord,1,16 September 2006,"OK, I understand what this film was *trying* to do. Yes, it was beautiful to look at but you know the awful, over the top acting that was typical of films made in the 40s? Well, it would appear that the entire cast was paying an homage to that particular style. The truth is so far stretched in this odd film that I would almost say it is an affront to the memory of Elizabeth Short. Hilary Swank's performance is shockingly bad with possibly the worst generic British accent I have heard. Scarlett Johanson's performance is close to career-ruiningly bad. The plot was disjointed with various bits and pieces rushed to conclusion at the end of the film which is just as well because I had truly lost the will to live by that point. I actually did on three occasions clasp my hand to my forehead, roll my eyes and mutter ""Oh for the love of god"" or ""You have GOT to be kidding me"" at the particularly cheesy scenes. Don't even get me started on the so-called sex scenes... what an absolute nonsense... when was the last time you scrabbled at someone's clothes with the same urgency and lack of co-ordination as a 3 year old on Christmas day with a particularly well-wrapped present!? I actually don't have anything positive to say about this film except that it looks pretty. Please don't waste your time with this... I want my 2 hours back. Oh, and another thing: one of the main reasons I chose this film was because of it's high rating on IMDb because I consider the members here to be a tough crowd. However, something is not quite right when over 300 IMDb users have rated it 10/10. Hmm... something odd going on there. I hope you enjoyed my colloquial little rant and I do hope I've spared you the horrors of this abomination purporting to be film entertainment.",The Black Dahlia
