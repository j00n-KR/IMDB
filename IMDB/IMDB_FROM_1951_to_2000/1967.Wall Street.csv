0,bkoganbing,Speculating Wolf,9,5 May 2008,"As Bud Fox in Wall Street, Charlie Sheen knows only one thing, he does not want the life his blue collar father and real life father Martin Sheen has. He's a child of the Eighties and wants to make money fast and live the good life. Inpatient with working in a brokerage house where he's barely breaking even paying for his yuppie lifestyle in Manhattan, Sheen wants to swim with the big fish. So he looks to ingratiate himself with the biggest fish of all, speculator Gordon Gekko.For Michael Douglas, Gordon Gekko has been the career role of his life, netting him the Best Actor Oscar for 1987 that eluded his father Kirk in three tries. Douglas is at once, charming, egocentric, shrewd, and ruthless. When he talked about his City College background and his father's background which seems remarkably similar to Sheen's it reminded me of Fredric March from Executive Suite. He also had a night school diploma, but rose to the top of his company through hard work and being completely ruthless. When Sheen brings him information about the airline that his father works maintenance for, Douglas makes a bundle and brings Sheen into his circle. But he's playing him like a piccolo as we soon find out.Darryl Hannah has a nice role as the trophy woman Douglas fixes for Sheen, but the performance I like is that of Terrence Stamp as the British tycoon who has a no holds barred rivalry with Douglas. He ultimately proves to be the key to the solution to the problem of the speculating wolf of Wall Street.Oliver Stone supplies us with a not to flattering look at the capitalist system. It should give one pause for reflection. Just imagine what it was like before the New Deal brought in the Securities and Exchange Commission and it was completely unregulated.It was the stuff the Stock Market Crash was made of. Though the thought of Gordon Gekko selling apples on the street is a pleasing one.",Wall Street
1,Leofwine_draca,Definitive portrayal of a decade,8,12 April 2011,"I can sometimes find Oliver Stone an overrated director but WALL STREET is the best I've seen of his yet. A quite wonderful exploration of a topic that's undoubtedly mystifying to most people, WALL STREET explores the world of the stockbroker in an interesting and engaging way. That along the way it showcases '80s greed and excuse and highlights a career-best performance from Michael Douglas as the reptilian Gordon Gecko is merely incidental.That Stone also elicits some compelling turns from a commendably straight Charlie Sheen, RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD'S James Karen as a delightfully weaselly boss and Terence Stamp just adds to the fun. A decent story, well told and acted by a cast of professionals.",Wall Street
2,SnoopyStyle,start of great Wall Street movies,8,30 November 2013,"It's 1985. Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) is a lowly grunt on Wall Street grinding out trades with unreliable clients. Every day, he calls the office of Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) hoping to hook the big fish. His father (Martin Sheen) casually passes on some important information about his work. Bud sees an in with Gekko if he could parlay the inside info into something more.Oliver Stone has made one of the first great Wall Street film. It is a clarion vision of Gekko's greed which is the fuel to the market. It has one of the most iconic line in history. In a few sentences, Gekko would encapsulate the driving force of his world. There are some parts that aren't as compelling. Some of it feels more dated than it should, and I'm not talking about the brick phone. But it made finance actually understandable, and watchable. IMO it's the first one to do so successfully.",Wall Street
3,Hitchcoc,Stiff and Hard to Swallow,6,22 March 2016,"First of all, I enjoyed MIchael Douglas's performance. He is a natural heel and his Gordon Gekko is superb. He has been created to be the most formidable of bad guys with no regard for anyone but himself. It sound like a certain race for the Republican nominee for President that is going on right now (2016). Beyond this, I found the rest of the cast stiff and uninteresting. The Sheens, for instance, are tired clichés in this. Not only that, they deliver their lines as if they had the script in hand at the first reading. I tired of the pontificating of most of the characters. Bring in Hal Holbrook to say pithy things about how the world is going to hell in a hand basket, wasting his talent. Then there is the usual endless noise of the broker's offices. Finally, the whole thing is so unbelievable. And what's with Darryl Hannah? She is singled out for her great performance. I found her to be absolutely uninteresting. I always thought she looked particularly spooky. It's not the worst movie ever made and it does have that ""greed"" speech, but even that seemed a bit contrived.",Wall Street
4,kosmasp,Show me the money!,7,6 April 2007,"I have to correct myself, this movie deserves at least 8/10. That's right from the start, but I won't change it (yet) up there. The quote I used in the summary line is from Jerry Maguire, just because the line works perfectly here. You have Michael Douglas in excellent form here as Gordon Gekko ... maybe the second most misunderstood character Stone has written, only second to Tony Montana. Misunderstood in the sense of Oliver Stone's intentions. Many people have taken Gekko's character the exact opposite way he was written. Stone never intended him to be that influential. But then again, those are the things, a director can do nothing about. And can also be seen as a testament for the fabulous acting! The movie is about greed and the fast way to earn money. Again Oliver Stones does not shy away from controversial material, but you might have guessed that already (or read it)! :o)",Wall Street
5,classicsoncall,"""Nothing ruins my day more than losses.""",8,14 January 2012,"I do these reviews not only because I like to research and write about a film in question, but also because they serve as somewhat of a diary of sorts reflecting my thoughts and what I'm doing at a particular point in time. I never saw this movie when if came out in 1987, in fact, today was the first time I've seen it. I chose to watch it precisely because it plays into the class warfare theme of the current presidential campaign, with both sides, Democrat and Republican playing fast and loose with a brand of populism they hope to earn victory with. One side plays into the whole one percent versus the ninety nine business a la Occupy Wall Street, while the other side stands defensive over the right of free markets and insisting the word 'profit' is not a dirty word. There's a certain hypocrisy with a liberal film maker like Oliver Stone (and Michael Moore) railing against money and greed, while taking their check to the bank for a product that the market (that would be you and me folks) either wants, needs or desires.I guess you can make your own judgment call about the film. I found it pretty interesting myself, fully expecting that one way or another, Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) would eventually get his comeuppance for steering protégé Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) into the depths of financial hell. In that respect, the film is actually quite predictable, so the better thing to do is sit back and enjoy the performances. Douglas is superb of course, exuding that 'have it all at any cost' mentality that defines the character of Gordon Gekko. You know, I get a chuckle out of that name every time I hear it because I picture that little lizard over at the Geico commercials, not a bad little capitalist himself if I do say so.So you fast forward a couple of decades and try picturing Charlie Sheen in the Gekko role. Just perfect, don't you think - Winning! It's too bad his learning curve spiraled in the wrong direction, taking all that fame and money and investing it in a self imploding career. I don't know when he'll surface again but it should be interesting.Though the movie is still relevant today, I did get a kick out of a really dated scene from the picture with Michael Douglas on the beach using that huge cordless phone a la Jerry Seinfeld in his TV series. The trivia notes here state that it was the first time a cell phone was ever shown in a feature film, so that's a bit of info you can amaze your friends with. The other thing about the picture is the tag line quote that everyone knows and often quotes. Condensed to convey the idea that 'Greed... is good', it's probably the second most quoted line from a film that was never uttered, right after 'Play it again, Sam'.",Wall Street
6,gavin6942,The 1980s Classic,8,3 November 2015,"A young and impatient stockbroker (Charlie Sheen) is willing to do anything to get to the top, including trading on illegal inside information taken through a ruthless and greedy corporate raider who takes the youth under his wing.Looking back on this film over twenty years down the road, it can be looked at one of two ways: either as an indictment of the 1980s and its consumerism. We learn, of course, that ""greed is good"", which may sum up the Reagan years. Or we can see it not so specifically and see that this is Wall Street, whether the 1980s or 1990s or beyond. Indeed, a sequel was made, and while I have not seen it, I suspect this is very much what we would see: the same bad behavior still going.That being said, this film ages really well. Just as it was an instant classic in its day, it is every bit the classic now (2015).",Wall Street
7,lee_eisenberg,"the '80s, when greed reigned supreme...",10,20 June 2005,"The main theme of the '80s was a complete and total rejection of '60s idealism, replacing it with an obsession with money. ""Wall Street"" shows that. Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) is an up-and-comer in the Wall Street scene. So determined is Bud to make it to the top, that he hooks up with Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas), a hyper-competitive, viciously corrupt corporate raider. Gekko lets Bud in on all the stock market's inside secrets. But, everything does have a price.Probably the movie's most famous scene is where Gekko stands up at a meeting and exalts greed. That sums up the whole '80s mentality. And ""Wall Street"" identifies that, showing how everything that goes on in these offices and trading rooms only benefits the people in the offices. Michael Douglas' Oscar win could not have been more deserved.",Wall Street
8,jboothmillard,Wall Street,7,19 April 2006,"From director Oliver Stone (Platoon, Natural Born Killers), I must admit I don't know much about stockbrokers or stock exchange, so no surprise I didn't really understand it the first time and needed to see it a second time, and now I can appreciate it being a good financial drama. Set in New York City on Wall Street in the 1980's, Bud Fox (Scary Movie 3's Charlie Sheen) is one of many stockbrokers with a desire to get to high success. Working for his firm during the day, he spends spare time trying to approach high-powered, extremely successful (but ruthless and greedy) broker Gordon Gekko (Oscar and Golden winning Michael Douglas). They do eventually meet, and Gekko does take the gullible youth under his wing and explains his philosophy. Taking the advice and working closely with Gekko, Fox finds himself in the world of a ""yuppie"", many business deals, the ""good life"", fast money, and fast women. Slowly though Fox sees Gekko's true greediness and no care for anything but money when Gekko threatens the Bluestar Airline company, which his father Carl (Martin Sheen) has worked at for years. In the end Fox's attempt to pretty much bring down Gekko backfires when he is arrested, and after a little fistfight with Gekko he is still insignificant in the world of Wall Street. Also starring Splash's Razzie winning Daryl Hannah as Darien Taylor, Terence Stamp as Sir Larry Wildman, Hal Holbrook as Lou Mannheim, Blade Runner's Sean Young as Kate Gekko, Secretary's James Spader as Roger Barnes and Identity's John C. McGinley as Marvin. Charlie Sheen in very believable, his dad Martin has his moments, and Douglas of course steals the show with his hateful (but at the same time likable) money hungry bastard character. Gordon Gekko was number 24 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, and the film was number 57 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""Greed, for lack of a better word, is good""). Very good!",Wall Street
9,rmax304823,Beware of Men Wearing Red Suspenders.,7,26 August 2009,"A chronicle of the times. Charlie Sheen is one of a Kafkaesque line of men at a brokerage firm cold-calling potential clients and trying to get them to buy or sell stock in order to make commissions. This is not enough. Sheen wants to rise to the top -- meaning he wants to make as much money as possible because wealth is how you keep score.With a bit of inside information, he worms his way into the crowd of wise guys surrounding the meat eater Gordon Gekko, Michael Douglas. The money begins to pour in, based on illegal insider tips and other shadowy means, and he acquires the services of Darryl Hannah who reveals to him her deepest desires -- ""the best of everything, the finest furniture, and world peace."" Unwittingly, with Douglas pulling the strings, Sheen betrays his father's employer, but when he finds out how he's been manipulated he gets even by seeing to it that prices of Douglas' main stock go down. Something like that. (I kept waiting for somebody to bring up ""structured derivative instruments."") Sheen brings Douglas down but he pays for his sins by getting clobbered, losing his newly acquired pelf, being deserted by Hannah, and going to jail.We can be sure that he will emerge a better man.Oliver Stone preaches a fiery sermon about greed, selling out, materialism, and all that. He can't seem to help himself. It's one of his more accessible films, though. The story is straightforward, about as comprehensible as any story about Wall Street is likely to be. There are a number of stereotypes to help us keep on the path. Hal Holbrook, for instance, works at the same brokerage firm as Sheen, but he's never going to win any prizes. He's steady, principled, and thoroughly marginalized. He dispenses an old hand's advice to Sheen. The advice runs along lines like these: ""There comes a time when a man stares into the abyss, and there's nothing looking back at him. That's when a man finds his character. And that's what keeps him out of the abyss."" So far we've been hearing quotes from Sun Tzu's ""The Art of War,"" but I think Holbrook has been dipping into Deepak Chopra.The performances are adequate, not much more than that, despite the Oscar that went to Michael Douglas. Douglas does get a chance to make his famous speech though -- you know, ""Greed is good."" I give Gordon Gekko credit. He's up front about the whole thing. ""Greed"", he tells us, ""captures the essence of evolution."" Those who rise to the top deserve to be there. Only the losers sink to the bottom, and the herd needs occasional pruning to flourish. It's true. Ask Paris Hilton. Ask Herbert Spencer. Well -- Spencer is dead, so you'll have to ask some other Social Darwinist. There are plenty of them on the blogs and on television and on the news boards.Some people think of that speech, and the film in which it's embedded, as a chronicle of the greedy 1980s but I think it still applies. When I was in a college bookstore long ago, Machiavelli was considered sort of a manipulative scumbag, but I recently noticed a paperback of ""The Prince"" with a cover design illustrating a hand, palm up, and a dozen people standing in it. (""You can have the world in the palm of your hand if you read this book on how to effectively manipulate others."") From villain to guru in twenty years.The nation has barely avoided an economic meltdown, due to Wall Street shenanigans, since this movie was released. The near-disaster had something to do with a housing bubble and those ""structured derivative instruments,"" which, the Talking Heads tell us, are far beyond our grasp. I don't know why they argue that. It's not so recherché. I know damned well what a structured derivative instrument is. It's an ""instrument,"" to begin with. A trumpet is a good example. And of course it's STRUCTURED. Everything is structured. A trumpet has a bell, a mouthpiece, a spit valve, and all those polished brass curlicues. There's your ""structure"" for you. And ""derivative""? What isn't ""derivative""? In this case, look for a trumpet's origins in long, thin, conch shells or maybe gnu horns. What's so difficult about that? Who's kidding whom around here?The movie gets an extra point or two for showing us how things work behind the scenes, and how they can lead to the collapse of a misty and illicit scheme. I doubt that the public or those responsible for regulating Wall Street wise guys ever saw this movie or, if they did, they gained nothing from it.",Wall Street
10,moonspinner55,Heavy-handed rendering of old TV clichés...,3,10 July 2005,"Great cast, with Michael Douglas in an Oscar-winning turn as Gordon Gekko, struggles to overcome the plastic, smug handling in this rendering of political and economical pseudo-realities in the trade market. Douglas' cutthroat investment buyer, who takes Charlie Sheen under his wing, has one memorable moment when he gives a speech on greed, but the rest of the time is a TV cliché, like one of those oil-racketeers on ""Dynasty"". Oliver Stone's handling of actors is, once again, uneven, with the women in the cast coming off especially poor; he gets nothing new out of them, Douglas included. Heavy-handed, thick-witted yuppie nonsense no longer looks or feels topical. It founders on embarrassing and predictable elements.",Wall Street
11,blanche-2,A good look at '80s greed,8,7 December 2006,"Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"" was released a couple of months after the big stock market crash of 1987, when a wealthy friend of mine had to rush home from Paris to assess the damage. Another friend said to me, ""It's nothing but high-class gambling."" Stone captures the Wall Street greed and the multimillionaire young men who populated the brokerage houses back in the '80s before they started folding. Everything was about making money (which hasn't changed much) and having all the external trappings of success and happiness. We heard a lot about the ""yuppies"" back then, who were a lot different from the beatniks and the hippies, both of whom in their own way went against the system. The new youth, however, reveled in ""the system,"" and capitalism was their god.The character of Bud Fox, portrayed by Charlie Sheen, is just such a young man, struggling to make it in the brokerage world. Ambitious, he worms his way in to see a major wheeler-dealer takeover king, Gordon Gecko (Michael Douglas). Gecko gives Bud a try and teaches him about the good life, insider trading, spreading buys to other brokers, wiring money to an offshore account - all the time keeping his own hands clean. Gecko even sends an ex-girlfriend (Darryl Hannah) to keep Bud company. It takes a while, but when Gecko dupes Bud into helping him take over the airline where his father works, Bud realizes he was a patsy.This is a good movie that really captures the atmosphere of those times when I lived in New York - everyone was buying co-ops and condos and playing the stock market. As Bud learns, money isn't the only way to measure success, and greed and heartlessness aren't for everyone.Charlie Sheen gives a very good performance - he's well cast as is, of course, Martin Sheen as his wise father who has a different set of values and recognizes Gecko's motives even if his son doesn't. Michael Douglas is perfect as a complete bastard - and don't kid yourself, these types exist in abundance. In fact, I can't even say the Gecko character is exaggerated. He's a total slimeball. Darryl Hannah is fairly lousy as the girlfriend who is falling for Bud but whose future success is tied to Gecko.Martin Sheen is the only one who's really a likable character, so the film has a certain coldness. So does Wall Street, especially if you happen to be on the losing end.",Wall Street
12,Quinoa1984,"""I create nothing. I own.""",7,22 October 2006,"Wall Street is at the least a pretty convincing take on an era, a time that may or may not seem to be caught in that near-decadent time capsule of the mid 80s when the President still had part of the country in the mind-set that business was booming, big-time. Oliver Stone, in taking cues from his (late) father, also a stockbroker, took on this insular, mammoth system using story and characters that are not, unfortunately, as powerful as the actors in cast. I'd say though it's probably one of the director's most accessible pictures, where the information is in your face and as clear as day. It's even absorbing, to a fault, for someone like myself who was too too young to know what was going on in the insider trading scandal(s) around this period. The sense of corruption is always in the air somewhere in Wall Street, and towards the last third it gets amplified, and it leaves the characters in the end (the two main male leads I mean) with nothing good going for either of them. It's the kind of world where one side eats the other, and then back on the other again.Not that Stone's points in the script, which isn't one of his best, don't give some good signals at times. He has a fine premise- an ambitious kid, Fox (Charlie Sheen in his innocent-turned-hot-headed form here), in a stuffy firm tries to bag an 'elephant', Mr. Gordon Gecko (Michael Douglas), who has more money and connection than any ten middle class people might have. Soon, through various dealings working his way up, Fox gets Gecko's attention- and in its own twisted form trust- and also gets rich, very rich. But at what cost becomes the real question, as Fox's father (Martin Sheen, a surprise cast choice for a real life father/son turn but still excellent here) might lose everything he's worked for at a little airline company. The filmmaker here, perhaps in reflection of his subject matter, makes his film in a slick fashion, but not in the wild and sensational style of his best work; here he's a little restrained, but in a good way nevertheless. There's even a multiple screen scene where a deal is shown from various angles, in four places in the same frame.As for character and the like, it's really up to the actors here to fill in the gaps. And the gaps, for me anyway, were that the script felt a little weighed down by predictability. Gecko is a character that could (or at least should) be seen through within the first few scenes. The seductive power of this to Fox isn't unconvincing, though it becomes a little trickier when an undercooked romantic sub-plot is thrown in with Darryl Hannah's two-side playing dame. But to say that the actor's end up filling the gaps is almost a compliment to Stone. Maybe he knew that he needed people who could make these conventional asides real and affecting to an extent, and it's a credit to Michael Douglas that he makes it one of his towering performances as an actor. He's ultra-slick, even cool in his sort of dastardly way, and there are at least three scenes he plays in that are always striking where it's hot (the famous 'greed is good' speech, the scene where Sheen confronts him about the airline stock betrayal, and the final scene in Central Park). Sheen, as well, delivers the goods here, and is especially noteworthy in scenes with his father.If there are some expected things in the story, and there are, the ending at least leaves things with a bittersweet note of interest. And Stone does raise some good questions about how morality, if anything of it, can work its way into the world of Free Trade where the sky can't even be considered the limit anymore. It's not as powerful a punch as say JFK or Born on the Fourth of July or NBK, but in its own right it holds its own as a very good piece of cautionary drama. (strong) B+",Wall Street
13,edwagreen,Wall Street- Investing Was Never This Good ***1/2,9,21 September 2009,"This was the part of parts for Michael Douglas. As Gordon Gekko, he was the embodiment of one of the major disadvantages of capitalism in this country. His richly deserved Oscar came for his work as a greedy, power-hungry, entrepreneur in the fields of real estate and high finance. Willing to step on anyone who came near to him, Douglas etched an unforgettable character.Kudos must go to Charlie and Martin Sheen for giving 2 splendid performances; the former as the go-getter who falls under the influence of Gekko and the latter, his father whose ethical values ultimately way heavily on the son.This is a searing film depicting the greed and lust that Wall Street can bring out in anyone. Inside training is the thing here as the finance pros think of this illegal activity as proper.",Wall Street
14,michaelRokeefe,It isn't money lost; just money transferred.,8,2 October 2010,"Director/producer Oliver Stone does not shy away from a good ""thinker's"" drama. Ironically, WALL STREET was released right before the stock market plunge in 1987. Antihero Gordon Gekko(Michael Douglas)is a ruthless high-rolling corporate raiding destroyer believing ""greed is good"". Easy to take a gamble stockbroker Bud Fox(Charlie Sheen)has always idolized Gekko and actually, if not passionately avails himself to the powerful spell of the megalomaniac. Fox, under Gekko's wing, gets a taste of the good life and is overcome by the greed and power in the fast lane. Gekko traps his young protégé in an insider-trading scheme set to take over an airline where Bud's father Carl(Martin Sheen) is a staid hard nose union rep. Bud is hit with a hard decision whether or not to continue in Gekko's unscrupulous take over that will ultimately destroy his father's livelihood. The script is word-wise and somewhat technical and may be too complicated for some to grasp. Nevertheless, conscience continues a battle with corporate growth and opportunity. The rise and fall of a Wall Street shark can prove quick and combustible. The star flooded supporting cast features: Hal Holbrook, James Karen, Daryl Hannah, John C.

15,sunwarrior13,"""Greed is Good.""",10,5 September 2012,"Wall Street is a film directed by Oliver Stone and stars Michael Douglas, Charlie Sheen, and Daryl Hannah. The screenplay was written by Stanley Weiser and Stone. The film tells the story of Bud Fox (Sheen), a young stockbroker desperate to succeed who becomes involved with his hero, Gordon Gekko (Douglas), a wealthy, unscrupulous corporate raider. Stone made the film as a tribute to his father, Lou Stone, a stockbroker during the Great Depression. The character of Gekko is said to be a composite of several people, including Owen Morrisey, Dennis Levine, Ivan Boesky, Carl Icahn, Asher Edelman, Michael Ovitz, Michael Milken, and Stone himself.""Greed is Good"".This is the credo of the aptly named Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas), the antihero of Oliver Stone's Wall Street. Gekko, a high-rolling corporate raider, is idolized by young-and-hungry broker Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen). Inveigling himself into Gekko's inner circle, Fox quickly learns to rape, murder and bury his sense of ethics. Only when Gekko's wheeling and dealing causes a near-tragedy on a personal level does Fox ""reform""-though his means of destroying Gekko are every bit as underhanded as his previous activities on the trading floor. Director Stone, who co-wrote Wall Street with Stanley Weiser, has claimed that the film was prompted by the callous treatment afforded his stockbroker father after 50 years in the business; this may be why the film's most compelling scenes are those between Bud Fox and his airline mechanic father.It is Stone's most impressive achievement in this film is to allow all the financial wheeling and dealing to seem complicated and convincing, and yet always have it make sense.",Wall Street

17,Theo Robertson,It's Confused And Dated,6,25 August 2004,"I can remember much of the 1980s and would have remembered much more if I didn't insist on drinking too much at that time . I remember it as the decade of of political ideologies clashing in the third world , of political boycotts of the Olympics and the threat of the cold war turning into a very hot conflict called World War Three which absolutely terrified me at the time . Strangely Oliver Stone thinks the worst thing of the decade was yuppie culture Charlie Sheen ( Straight from his star turn from PLATOON ) plays Bud Fox the hero of the story who seeing that Gordon Gekko wants to buy and asset strip his father's aircraft company goes out of his way to bring down the Gekko empire This is where I got confused . Bud comes from a blue collar background and pulled himself up by the bootlaces to get where he is , he's done this through a capitalist economic system that will see him richer beyond his wildest dreams . In a slightly different manner he's very similar to Gekko who under slightly different circumstances has also got where he has through the capitalist free market system , so what is it that Stone is attacking ? There's a contradiction here somewhere . I guess because Gekko is "" greedy "" it's this what makes him out as the bad guy ? It's because young Bud knew hard times and still has a conscience about blue collar workers and their jobs that he's the good guy ? Is that what Stone is saying ? By a bitter and unconscious irony on the part of Stone you could say that the all reaching corporate greed of Gekko is a metaphor for Reaganomics while the protect the jobs of American blue collar workers at all costs ideals of Bud is almost identical to the ideas of Pat Buchanan . Is Stone praising Buchananite philosophy ? You see the point I'm making about a confused message ?WALL STREET is also rather dated watching it now . Check out those hairstyles . No wonder there's a hole in the ozone layer with the amount of hairspray in the movie . The soundtrack by Stewart Copeland is also very sterile and mechanical like much of 1980s music . There's also several funny scenes where Gekko takes phone calls on his mobile phone where he has to fiddle about with the antenna at the top and hold it with both hands since in those days mobile phones resembled two house bricks glued togetherDespite my criticisms WALL STREET isn't a bad movie . Charlie Sheen is every bit as good here as he was in PLATOON ( Though these are probably the only two movies where he gives very good performances ) while Michael Douglas is superb as the amoral Gordon Gekko , and Terence Stamp and Martin Sheen are always worth watching , and considering the movie mainly revolves around a bunch of people in offices making as much money as they can the story is compelling in parts",Wall Street
18,view_and_review,If You're not Cheating You're not Trying,7,14 September 2019,"We don't have to pretend that we know how all of Wall St. works to understand this movie and know it's pretty good.Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) had a strong desire to be rich and successful on Wall Street. Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) was rich and successful and had the ability to show Bud the way. Except, Gordon didn't always play fair. He was not beyond a little insider trading. Forget about the fact he was a cold-blooded businessman that would: ""not only sell his mother to make a deal. He'd send her C.O.D."" as stated by Gekko's rival, Larry Wildman--he frequently broke the rules to get a few more million dollars.Wall Street was a little look inside how Wall Street runs but a deeper look into Bud Fox. How far would he go to get ahead? Would he also be another Gordon Gekko. This movie was fast-paced, sheik, and somewhat enlightening. No, you won't be a savvy trader after watching this but you just may learn some things about yourself.",Wall Street
19,AlsExGal,Much more than a snapshot of the 80's,8,15 November 2009,"Wall Street"" is a movie that seems to spark much debate. Basically, it is the working out of a moral struggle within young Wall Street trader Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) between the values with which he was raised of hard work and success through actual creation, versus those of his mentor Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) who succeeds through corporate raiding and ""creative destruction"". From Bud's viewpoint his dad's (Martin Sheen's) road map for success and happiness seems old-fashioned to the point of being prehistoric compared to Gekko's, until Gekko sets his sights and his wrecking ball on his father's company, and Bud is forced to choose.Many people associate this film with a liberal versus conservative viewpoint on business, a wild-west economy versus a planned economy and relegate this film to 1980's era nostalgia, like the now humorously giant cell phone Gekko is talking on as he walks along the beach. It is said that neither extreme works and that we've gradually settled towards something in the middle. However, the Gekkos of this world are smarter than that, and over the past 20 plus years they have set up an economic system that serves them well. What we now have is a situation where the haves and have-mores have a planned - almost Soviet - system in which the rules stratify them at the top. I cite the changes in bankruptcy law as exhibit A. The members of the labor force that serve them, however, are in the wild-west economy that was once advocated for everyone. Some will rise to the stratified top in this situation, but the vast majority will remain at the bottom shooting it out with each other - for scarce good jobs, good health care, education, etc. Thus, to me, Wall Street is just an opening chapter in the saga of how economic forces and attitudes toward them have changed, not the portrait of a 25 year-old fad that has come and gone.",Wall Street
20,AaronCapenBanner,Greed,7,4 December 2013,"Oliver Stone directed this interesting drama that stars Charlie Sheen as Bud Fox, a young but ambitious stockbroker in New York whose time is taken up entirely by his job, though in off-hours he tries to impress powerful and wealthy, but also ruthless and greedy corporate raider Gordon Gekko(played by Michael Douglas, who won the Academy Award for best actor) Gordon will eventually take Bud under his wing, and guides him to helping Gordon get inside information he can use, which involves his father Carl(played by his own father Martin Sheen) who ends up feeling betrayed by this, and Bud's life will spiral out-of-control as the authorities threaten to indict him if he won't testify against Gekko in court...

Charlie Sheen should have been nominated for his performance as Bud Fox, a young inspiring and ambitious trader. Martin Sheen played Bud's father. The cast is first rate with Daryl Hannah, Sean Young, John C. McGinley, Hal Holbrook and others in this Oliver Stone production. The director makes a cameo in there too. The film was done entirely on location in New York City and the twin towers were still at the foot of Manhattan.

22,mm-39,Michael Douglas plays a villain,8,13 September 2002,"Funny, how history repeats itself.  With Enron, World com, and now Tyco this movie is ahead of its time.  Now the corporate world goes beyond the unethical standards this movie brought up.  Sheen's second best performance after Platoon.  Douglas shines as Gordon Gecko with his greed is good speech.  I believe profits and technology is good, or we would be economically left behind without it. Greed in itself, can destroy the economy, environment, and peoples' lives.  What happens to the economy if business destroys the middle class? I took economics and no goods would be sold, and America's economic might would fall.  This movie addresses this important issue.  Greed vs values, the country and peoples lives.  The funny irony is when Gecko said the air manufacture could not compete with deregulation that is exactly what happened.  There is a reality with what the analysts say also.  8/10",Wall Street
23,Mr-Fusion,Captured the zeitgeist like nobody's business,10,3 April 2015,"You can't bring up ""Wall Street"" without mentioning Michael Douglas. The man owns this movie. His ""greed is good"" speech is iconic because it's so alluring. You've got this despicable corporate raider yapping about survival of the fittest, but oozing charisma throughout. And he takes Charlie Sheen to school in every one of their scenes. He is a thrill to watch. The whole movie has that same level of appeal, which makes for some staggering replay value. Sure, subtlety isn't the movie's strong suit, but then again, you pretty much know that early on. This is a story that's easy to get sucked into. Even the dialogue is seductive (trading jargon comes at you pretty fast, but still manages to make sense - which says a lot, seeing as I don't have a head for finance or stocks).For me, this movie is purely a time capsule; the phones, the look, the feel. It just seems to transport you to a certain 1987 that feels manufactured, but also somehow authentic. There's the sense that this is the world you'd inhabit if you'd just traveled in Gordon Gekko's circles. And it's got its finger on the pulse of the decade's excess, so it feels totally real. In short, this is a pure, uncut '80s movie. And I love everything about it. Copeland's unconventional score, the brilliant casting of Martin Sheen as Charlie's dad (Martin elevates almost every movie he's in) and the easy watchability of the whole thing. 10/10",Wall Street
24,namashi_1,Very Good Film...,8,9 May 2010,"Oliver Stone's 1987 classic 'Wall Street' is a terrific, energetic film with almost everything working on it's advantage. 'Wall Street' is about greed, desperation, success, failure and most importantly, MONEY! It tells the story of a young stockbroker desperate to succeed and becomes involved with his hero, whose, a wealthy, unscrupulous corporate raider. The film unfolds wonderfully, there is hardly moment when you move your eyes from the screen. The climax is electrifying, it's very, very gripping.Stone's direction is awe-inspiring, and so is he writing. Robert Richardson's Camera-Work is excellent, the lens-men takes each shot with precision.In the acting department, Michael Douglas is excellent in a role that won him the Academy Award for Best Actor. The Veteran plays a conniving, self-centered corporate raider with rare ease. Charlie Sheen is very good, here's an actor who deserved to make movies. Daryl Hannah is okay, while Martin Sheen leaves a mark. John C. McGinley and Terence Stamp are terrific in their roles. James Spader hams, as usual.Summing up state-meant: Must See film for all!",Wall Street
25,JamesHitchcock,The Gospel According to Mammon,7,29 May 2008,"""Wall Street"" contains two lines which have become famous; ""Lunch is for wimps"" and ""Greed is good"". The latter quote, in particular, has become associated with the 1980s; it is frequently used to sum up the money-obsessed ethos of the decade, even by people who have never seen the film.This period saw a number of films set in the world of high finance. ""Working Girl"" from 1988 takes a generally positive view of the capitalist system, despite the presence of a few bad apples like Sigourney Weaver's character, but ""Wall Street"" is a satire on greed and corruption, as one might perhaps expect from a left-wing director like Oliver Stone. Yet its prevailing tone is not necessarily socialist or anti-capitalist. (Many American ""leftists"" are in fact fairly centrist in European terms.) Its morality, in fact, has a lot in common with that of another film, ""Pretty Woman"" from 1990. Both divide capitalism into good and bad. On the one hand are companies which provide or deal in goods and services which ordinary people actually want to use. (Good). On the other hand there are corporate raiders like Gordon Gekko in ""Wall Street"" or Edward Lewis in ""Pretty Woman"", who make all their money through financial sleight of hand, without ever producing anything tangible. (Bad).Another connection between the two films is that father-son relationships play an important part in both. Edward's main psychological motivation is resentment of his late father, from whom he had become estranged. In ""Wall Street"" there is an underlying tension between the main character, Bud Fox, and his father, Carl. The two are played by real-life father and son Martin and Charlie Sheen. Carl, an aircraft mechanic working for an airline named Blue Star, is a trade union activist. He values honesty and hard work more than financial success, believing that you cannot measure a man's success by the size of his wallet. Although Carl is not estranged from his son, he nevertheless disapproves of the young man's system of values, which is quite at odds with his own.Bud is an ambitious young stockbroker, for whom making money is the supreme goal in life. He becomes the protégé of Gekko, a ruthless and immensely rich financier, and under Gekko's patronage starts to enjoy great success, acquiring wealth, a luxury apartment in a desirable area of New York and a beautiful girlfriend Darien (who just happens to be one of Gekko's former mistresses). Bud is, at first, untroubled by the fact that Gekko's business methods are not only unethical but also actually illegal, as Gekko makes most of his money by relying on inside information. His conscience begins to trouble him, however, when Gekko makes a takeover bid for Blue Star. If successful this bid will make a huge profit for Gekko and his associates, but only at the cost of destroying the company and of making Carl, and thousands like him, unemployed.""Pretty Woman"" is essentially a modern-dress fairy tale, and like all fairy tales has a happy ending. Edward has a change of heart, becomes a good capitalist rather than a bad one and walks off into the sunset with Julia Roberts on his arm, her past as a call girl presumably forgotten. ""Wall Street"" is a more austere morality tale, a secular sermon on the theme of ""What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world, and lose his soul"". Bud must choose between the values of his true father Carl and those of Gekko, who can also be seen as a father-figure, but in his case a wicked stepfather. There will not necessarily be a happy ending; if Bud does the right thing in moral terms, it is likely to cost him dearly in material ones- the loss of his job, the end of his relationship with Darien and a possible jail sentence for his part in Gekko's misdeeds.My main criticism of the film is that its morality is rather too cut-and-dried. Its division of capitalist enterprise into two forms, one creative and the other parasitic, was too simplistic, as in reality the two are intimately connected. Manufacturing and service industries are reliant upon the money markets, which they need to raise investment capital for their businesses. The plot can also, at times, be difficult to follow for anyone without an intimate knowledge of high finance or a degree in economics.The film's main strength, however, is its acting, particularly from Martin Sheen and Michael Douglas. 1987 was Douglas's annus mirabilis, the year which saw the two films, ""Wall Street"" and ""Fatal Attraction"", which made him one of the most admired male stars of the period. He is particularly good in ""Wall Street"", the film which won him his only acting Oscar. (He also received, as producer, the ""Best Picture"" award for ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest). Gekko's surname was obviously intended to suggest someone cold and reptilian. (Oliver Stone seems to have overlooked the fact that in some countries geckos are welcomed because they eat harmful insects). Nevertheless, Douglas does always not portray Gekko as cold. He is often shown as a man driven by passion, but by a passion for money, not for love or sex. In private he can be a foul-mouthed, foul-tempered vulgarian, but in public he can often be surprisingly persuasive, proving that the Devil not only has the best tunes but also some of the best speeches. His famous ""Greed is Good"" speech to the shareholders of Blue Star is delivered with blazing conviction, a sort of sermon based upon the Gospel According to Mammon. More than anything else, it is Douglas who makes ""Wall Street"" a memorable film. 7/10.",Wall Street
26,Smells_Like_Cheese,Greed is no longer for the amateurs,8,31 July 2011,"In the 1980's if there was a defining movie of the generation, I would say that Wall Street is up there. Corporate America was being fully created and it's interesting to see that bit of history before what the economy is today. But in the 80's it was all about being a player and becoming a huge success. Wall Street truly captures the time and is one of Michael Douglas's defining roles as the villainess Gordon Gekko. I saw a clip of Wall Street in my film class a few years ago and for some reason even though it seemed interesting to me, I never got to see it. Thankfully I found Wall Street in my mom's DVD collection and watched it today. It's interesting to see a film like this where you see the original idea developed before a bunch of later movies ripped off the ""rise and fall"" plot. Wall Street is a powerful movie that shows you the rise of the wealthy and how they still look down on the honest hard working people, so quick to make a quick buck no matter who they hurt.Bud Fox, a junior stockbroker, is desperate to get to the top. He wants to become involved with his hero, Gordon Gekko, a ruthless and legendary Wall Street player, whose values could not conflict more with those of Bud's father Carl, a blue-collar airline maintenance and union president. Bud visits Gekko on his birthday and, granted a brief interview, pitches him stocks, but Gekko is unimpressed. Realizing that Gekko may not do business with him, a desperate Bud provides him some inside information about Bluestar Airlines, which Bud learned in a casual conversation from his father. A dejected Bud returns to his office where Gekko places an order for Bluestar stock, becoming one of Bud's clients. But Bud learns that there might be more to greed than he expected.Michael Douglas delivers a powerful performance as Gekko, the way he plays Fox and uses him was just brutal. Everyone wants to be rich, everyone wants to be successful, but at what cost? Gekko is the ultimate example of someone who will not only buy and sell you, but step over your body to get the cash. His speech of greed was so on key and powerful that I could understand why the people were so quick to go to his side of things. Greed is good, maybe in some ways that's true, it just depends on what you do to succeed. Charlie Sheen pulls in a good performance as well bouncing off of Douglas and you truly feel for his character because we have all been in his shoes. At the glimmer of a rich future, it sounds good to be bad, but when he realizes that he's hurting his own father and business, maybe it's not worth it, he's just Bud Fox.Wall Street is a great movie that was ahead of it's time and still remains a powerful movie to this day. The ultimate betrayals and to show that you can't trust anyone in the business world still holds. Oliver Stone really captured the excitement and downfalls of Wall Street perfectly; you can tell that New York is his city. Wall Street defines the 1980's very well when it was the rise of the get rich quick schemes. I highly recommend this movie; greed is now made for everyone.8/10",Wall Street
27,blanbrn,Greed is good. Be on the inside not on the outside! Best film that showed the big money and business greed of the late 80's.,7,15 October 2007,"I must say now that director Oliver Stone looks like a brilliant mind a fortune teller. Long before the scandals of Enron, Haliburton, Harken, and many other company and corporate insider trading scandals, this film showed it first hand in 1987 two decades before. It's amazing how the future business world would become, as this ahead of it's time 1987 film showcased the insider trading world of big and greedy crooked business. ""Wall Street"" also captures the times and themes of the late 80's when everything was getting bigger, better, and most of all people just more greedy with power and money. Set in New York City's upper Manhattan Charlie Sheen stars as Bud Fox an eager and newcomer stock broker who feels the need and desire for success and big bucks. The only way he sees success is by the hand of help from legendary wall street wizard Gordon Gekko(Michael Douglas)who introduces him to the illegal means and methods of corporate power and money by obtaining insider tips! And it's what we would all come to see with these crooks buying troubled companies and destroying worker pensions, keeping secrets from other investors and brokers just a dirty game of greed and stabbing one another in the back. Yet in the end even this tale of greed and power turns to morality showing that riches come at a high price and it corrupts the soul and spirit. Great 80's film that showed the future of insider trading two decades before it became water cooler discussion. Also the performance from Michael Douglas was top notch he was ruthless, cold, and calculated as the greedy Gekko and well deserving of his 1987 best actor Oscar, and Martin Sheen and Daryl Hannah and James Spader give good supporting performances.",Wall Street
28,KineticSeoul,Money talks,8,13 September 2012,Greed for money is what this movie is about and where it can lead. Gordon Gekko played by Michael Douglas is the iconic and memorable character in this who is the epitome of greed. And Douglas does a awesome job playing a greed filled tyrant that is manipulative but also has some memorable lines. But majority of the story is shown through a ambitious stockbroker(Charlie Sheen) who will take the shortcut to get to the destination he wants. And would get his hands dirty for Gordon Gekko and be his lackey to the position he is dying for. Even shunning away the people that actually care about him. Now although Gordon Gekko is the tyrant Charlie Sheen's character is more unlikeable. Since Gekko knows who he is but Sheen's character have one foot outside the door and one foot in and is smug about it. Which shows what money can do to a person if the intentions are not right. The thing about money is once you get close to the top you are never satisfied and want more and compare yourself to the people that have more. And this movie shows that vividly. The whole movie is basically money talk but it's intriguing to watch because the dialogue is sharp especially when talking business. Things have changed in the business world after this movie came out but I can see why this movie is a classic. If your interested in economics or real-estate. There is a high chance your gonna like this movie.8.3/10,Wall Street
29,sddavis63,A Convincing Portrait Of Greed,6,3 July 2009,"There's no doubt that ""Wall Street"" managed to capture the mood of the 1980's perfectly, at least as far as the financial world was concerned: the attitude that said ""look out for number one and to hell with everybody else."" In that sense, this movie provides a convincing portrait of greed, and is very relevant to today's world, with Bernie Madoff and the financial collapse all logical outcomes of that 80's attitude. In line with that was the marvellous performance by Michael Douglas as the high flying financier Gordon Gekko, whose basic motto was ""greed is good,"" and who obviously considered qualities such as love, loyalty or friendship as character flaws that simply stood in the way of making money. I also thought Charlie Sheen was quite convincing as Bud Fox, an ambitious but honest small time trader who latches on to Gekko and wants to follow in his footsteps, becoming corrupted in the process. A couple of the supporting performances were also worth mentioning: Darryl Hannah as Darien, a well connected decorator who starts to fall for Bud, but makes clear that, her feelings aside, she's not interested unless he has the money, and Hal Holbrook, who served as the ""conscience"" of the movie - a successful trader who had stayed clean, but was looked down upon by the younger traders, whose mood was summed up by Marvin (John McGinley) who said of him ""do you still want to be coming into the office in your late 60's like that guy?"" Having said all those positives, I found the basic weakness of the movie to be that the backroom wheeling and dealing just wasn't that interesting to watch. Good performances can't totally make up for a basically uninteresting - and, in the end, quite predictable - story. They do prevent me from thinking this was a bad movie, but I also can't think of it as a great one. 6/10",Wall Street
30,thesar-2,Greed is what got us in this mess,6,9 May 2009,"Yes, I admit, having never seen 'Wall Street' before, I was drawn to see it due to the pending sequel with (possible) Michael Douglas and Shia LaBeouf. And what a dated movie it was – look at that hair and those computers! It was like watching the original 'Star Trek' series for technology tips. I am not a stoke broker, or savvy on Wall Street trading, so it was interesting to see the day-in-the-life of those who worked/breathed the buying/selling. But it was hard to believe, other than the manipulating factor, Douglas's character would take on wet-behind-the-ears (Charlie) Sheen as a protégé. Still, you have to accept Douglas (""Greed is Good"") as a billionaire who befriends Sheen for insider trading. And the obvious rise and fall, the true-life 80s greed factor takes place. Personally, it's hard to watch even real life personalities portrayed in this film: Daryl Hannah's gold-digging art-seller and friends. These people in real-life suck and this is not coming from a poor man. This is coming from a human. So, it is (sadistically) somewhat nice to see them fail. Funny, this movie is as relevant back in 1987 as it is 22 years later. And sad at the same time, to see how little has changed. OK, back to the movie. Great performance from the always wonderful Oscar-winner Douglas, and it was great to see the typical 80s/90s Tom Cruise role of the know-it-all/hot shot go to Charlie Sheen. And his father also did a great job, as did Hal Holbrook and James Spader. I hated the anticlimactic ending which seemed rushed and did not feature Douglas, as it should've. So, I am looking forward to the sequel that will expand a little more. Still, this was well done and surprisingly, unfortunately still relevant.",Wall Street
31,sol-kay,The Most Valuable Commodite I know of Is Information,8,9 October 2005,"(Some Spoilers) Greed and corruption on the street of money power and broken dreams is highlighted in Oliver Stone's 1987 movie ""Wall Street"" that ironically was released just two months, on December 11, 1987, after the great October 19, 1987 ""Black Monday"" stock market crash. Where the Dow fell 508 points or 22% in just one trading session a record at that time and, in some twenty years of record ups and downs on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has never come even close to equal or break it. Trying to make it with the big boys on Wall Street young stock-broker Bud Fox, Charlie Sheen, has been leaving massages to his hero corporate raider Gordon Gekko's, Michael Douglas,office every day for two months to get an interview with him. Working at a brokerage house on Wall Street is slowly draining Bud of his life and money with him going nowhere and having to worry every day if he's called into his boss' office and given his walking papers.Bud wants to be independent like the great Gordon Gekko and the only way he can do that is by having some of that Gekko charm rub off on him by being a member of his team. Getting the news from his dad Carl Fox, Martin Sheen, that the airline that he works for,and is the union president, Bluestar Air has won a suit filed against it. That gave Bud the opening that he needs to get in good with Gekko by giving him the vital information, before it becomes public, and thus make a big score by buying up blocks of shares of Bluestar Air before they shoot up with the news. It turned out to be the biggest mistake that Bud would ever make and in the end put him behind bars and caused his dad to end up in the hospital with a near-fatal heart attack as well as bar Bud from ever working in any capacity with money on Wall Sreet for the rest of his life. Straight out of the headlines of the Wall Street Boom and Bust years of the 1980's the movie ""Wall Street"" shows how people in high places of money and power just can't get enough of what they want that they'll go as far as ending up in a prison cell in order to get it. Gekko uses the naive and unsuspecting Bud Fox to do his dirty work by getting inside information and then buying and selling stock on it. Bud thus puts his head on the chopping block if caught with the clever Gekko in being left out of the loop to Bud's, and secretly Gekko's, criminal activities. We see in the movie the sheer cold-bloodiness and shrewdness in people like Gekko and his underhanded actions in them destroying companies and businesses without even the slightest feeling for the thousands of people who's lives that they destroy, financially, by doing it. Bud for his part as a major player, a 50 to 100 million dollar man, in the Gekko money stock and real estate empire has it made with all his dreams as a big time Wall Street money maker coming true. Bud at first lives and rubs shoulders with the rich and famous and most of all with those with power and influence. It's soon that Bud starts to feel a bit wheezy when he learns that his hero Gekko plans to engineer a corporate take-over of his dad's place of business Bluestar Air. Gekko tells Bud that he's doing it to save his dad's and all the Bluestar Air workers their jobs which was just the opposite of what Gekko planned for them and their company. Fine performances all around with and Academy Award going to Michael Douglas as best actor as the greedy and charming Gordon Gekko styled after the Mad Russian of Wall Street Ivan Boesky. Gekko seemed to be at first a hard driving but decent guy who rewards his friends and destroys his enemies but in the end a lowlife snake in the grass who'll sell you out as fast as he'll buy out your business and turn it into a junk heap if he feels he can turn a profit on it. Charlie Sheen as Bud Fox is perfect as the up and coming Wall Street Whiz Kid who's being used by his mentor, Gordon Gekko, to make the big bucks and then, if the time comes, take the fall for him. Classy Daryl Hanna as Darien Taylor is both Gekko's mistress and Bud's live-in girlfriend without him, Bud, knowing that his hero, Gekko, is not only setting him up for a fall but screwing his girl behind his back as well. Martain Sheen is also perfect as Bud's dad, he is in real life, and the person who put his star struck and confused son straight on what Gekko's intentions really are and not to fall for his line of BS about caring for the working people of America.There's also Terence Stamp as Sir Larry Wildman Gekko's biggest rival on the street who together with Gekko makes the world of corporate raiders look like the dog-eat-dog world that it really was back then in the 1980's and even now: A world where human feelings are as scarce as greed is plentifully.",Wall Street
32,Robert_duder,Another eighties film that encompasses everything the decade stood for,8,16 July 2005,"Oliver Stone if nothing else is the most controversial director in history. He is not afraid to take on any subject, portray any opinion and in the process tends to bring out the best in great actors. Even when he does a really bad film (and there has been a few...Alexander for instance) he still manages to make it his own and never fears to state the controversial. Wall Street is the pinnacle of what the eighties was all about greed, success based on monetary value, the thin line between morality and the ""bad guy,"" and all this takes place on the finance capital of the world...Wall Street.Wall Street is the story of young up and coming stock broker Bud Fox. Born and raised to blue collar parents he is desperate to prove himself with monetary value and success. Unfortunately the financial world around him is cutthroat and the master of all this is a business billionaire named Gordon Gekko. Fox has spent months trying to get into Gekko's inner circle and broker for him. Finally Fox's father gives inadvertently gives him an inside tip on a very low level stock and Fox finds his opportunity to bring it to Gekko. He talks Gekko into it and it makes them a boatload of cash. Fox is now on the inside of Gekko's seedy world and he quickly realizes that Gekko didn't get rich by being on the up and up. Insider trading, theft, spying, it's all part of the game but it's making Fox very rich, gives him the woman of his dreams, and he seems to have everything he's ever wanted but it's slowly causing the people he cares about to be hurt by Gekko's strong handed business tactics. When Fox discovers Gekko has double crossed him and intends on shutting down his father's business Fox uses everything Gekko has taught him to turn the tables and get revenge even if it means losing everything.Michael Douglas in his Academy Award winning role is cutthroat and not the bad guy per se but really makes you love him and hate him all at once. Charlie Sheen who was of course one of the golden boys of the eighties does a good job but I kept thinking that Tom Cruise would have perhaps done an even better job. Oliver Stone does an incredible job of making a very complex area seem easier to understand in layman's terms and perhaps the audience doesn't always know what's going on but you never lose the focus of the film. It's captivating and edgy and controversial and you keep waiting for all this stuff to catch up to Fox and even moreso to Gordon Gekko. Darryl Hannah in another common role when they were trying to make her famous but she's just kind of there and doesn't add much to the film. This is a very intelligent, and interesting film and thrives on the whole eighties decade. I suggest anyone wanting to enjoy a really high strung film about finance check this one out. Performances are amazing and the story is entertaining and intelligent. 8.5/10",Wall Street
33,Lejink,Do the Wall Street Shuffle...,7,15 March 2010,"Epochal film from the 80's, which has almost unbelievably, in today's post Merrill Lynch / Northern Rock (depending on which side of the pond you're on) banking debacles become topical again, so much so that a same director / same star follow-up is reportedly in the making.It will have to go some though to beat the shock and awe value of its prototype, with Douglas' larger than life personification of corporate greed, Gordon Gekko, dominating proceedings. Charlie Sheen is the young trader on the make, aiming to aspire, or so he thinks, to Gekko's status and success, trying so hard to please his idol that he not only ends up aping his appearance (slicked back hair, big suspender braces) but even betraying his idealistic union-man father by relaying insider knowledge on the latter's ailing airline employer to Gekko who then moves in to welsh on his workforce-friendly words to asset strip the company for massive personal gain. Sheen's Bud Fox character eventually has an epiphany, augured by the coincidence of real-life and cinema dad Martin copping a heart attack and turns on and indeed turns in his guru to the authorities to bring ultimate closure to the piece.The film has its faults; I didn't quite buy into Douglas surrogate-father figure appeal to Sheen Jr., the coincidental heart attack of Sheen/Fox Sr is a bit too pat and some of the supporting characters come on like mere ciphers, including Terence Stamp as the UK magnate-cum-nemesis of Gekko and Daryl Hannah as a Gekko cast-off girlfriend/groupie who becomes young Sheen's trophy girl-friend. This leads to a larger criticism on the paucity of female characters in the film at all, but if you can accept that this is a man's man's man's world, to paraphrase James Brown, then this morality tale of its time still packs a punch, especially with the collapse of Communism and the surrender of the likes of Russia, China et. al to the addictive drug of big-bucks capitalism.Stone's camera is constantly on the move, capturing the frenetic-ism of dealers on the trading floor as market frenzy takes hold, with the dialogue razor-sharp throughout, so many of the phrases of course having become clichés for that era, almost entering common parlance the language, such as greed is good, lunch is for wimps and more.In the end, young Sheen would have done well to be careful what he wished for, but if he's the Little Red Riding Hood to Douglas' Big Bad Wolf, this particular out-sized fairy tale reaches its conclusion fittingly and satisfyingly, opening up a seamy, selfish world that you know is out there still, now more than ever.",Wall Street
34,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Another classic that's stood the test of time for a reason,10,9 April 2011,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) is a young investment broker in Manhattan who tries to sell stocks and shares over the phone during the day, but is also desperately trying to secure a meeting with Wall Street whizz king Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) to try and impress him and convince him to invest in a deal Bud thinks has potential. Gekko takes a shine to the boy, and takes him under his wing, but Bud fails to see him manipulating him and making him engage in very underhand tactics to get what he wants.Oliver Stone, always a big time director to go against the mainstream idea of movie-making, tried his hand here at the risky business of opening up the world of movers and shakers, stocks and shares, sound investments and dud choices, in the world of finance. And it obviously paid off, and so popular culture has benefited from an enduring character in Douglas's Gekko, a man who eats, sleeps and breathes money, whose whole world revolves around every philosophical word of wisdom he's developed in the world he inhabits and fixated always on the latest investment opportunity he's engaged in. A man who's convinced himself that 'greed is good' and creates opportunities, wealth and advancement in the human race. Sheen's eager, enthusiastic, enamoured young upstart is sure to be set on a collision course to become his vision of perfection.This is a film that was to make names for both it's lead stars, and it's fitting that their circumstances were so similar. Both were the sons of well known actors, and both had a lot to prove to the 'they're only where they are because of their fathers' crowd. So in turn, they've both turned in stellar, dynamite performances that compliment each other perfectly. Both are driven and centred on their roles, with good support from old hands Martin Sheen and Hal Holbrook, as well as new comer John C. McGinley. It seems great fame and acclaim are better achieved later in life, as while Douglas's career went on to ascend new heights, Sheen sadly went off the rails and became more famous for his life away from the camera than in front of it, the expectation and inherited fame seeming to prove all too much for him. Nevertheless, he's likely to always be well remembered as the yin to Douglas's raging yang in this classic morality tale. *****",Wall Street
35,ElMaruecan82,"Oliver Stone unveils capitalism's most hideous and pervert side ... and unfortunately, it's still relevant today ...",9,25 September 2012,"""You know what capitalism is?"" By using the F-word in a passive form, we could have wondered whether it was Tony Montana or Oliver Stone, the writer, expressing his personal bias in the crime epic ""Scarface"".Well, ""Wall Street"" features a less criminal setting, but does work as a continuation of the powerful diatribe against the capitalist mentality initiated by Stone in ""Scarface"", much more explicit this time, because the most American director appropriately targets America's sensitive nerve. And ""Wall Street', although carrying the mark of the 80's hasn't lost one ounce of relevance in 25 years.The script itself is full of universal aphorisms and historical references justifying that either ""greed, for lack of a better word is good"" or that ""the rich have been doing it to the poor since the beginning of time."" Finance divides the worlds into categories, 1% that owns half the wealth, and the poor exploited schmucks. That's how it worked, works and will always work. And it's impossible to review the film without thinking of the 'Occupy Wall Street' movement or a figure like Bernie Madoff who reduces Gordon Gekko to the level of a three-card trick player.Stone said he wanted to make ""Wall Street"" because he's always been shocked by the 25-30 year old golden boys who accumulated lifetime fortunes from speculation, epitomizing the most pervert aspect of the American Dream and caricaturing the notion of self-made-men to the extreme. The possibility to get wealthy without creating wealth is not just the most hideous face of capitalism that Stone unveils; it's the core of Gordon Gekko's behavior, a modern illustration of the law of the jungle. Money is not created, only transferred, and it's a zero - sum game where you either win or lose. By this admission, Gekko belies his own tribute to greed as a driving value because greed drives nothing but one's own egoism.""Wall Street"" works as ferocious and eye-opening journey into a rotten system seen through the sparkling eyes of a young newcomer, Buddy Fox (Charlie Sheen), a broker in a Wall Street firm and Gordon Gekko's number one fan. Fox grew up in a modest family and his father Carl, played by Martin Sheen, is a mechanic and union leader who tried to inculcate values in total opposition with Gekko's. Gekko, in fact, can't consider any value that doesn't end with a dollar sign. It's precisely Fox's poverty that drove his voracious appetite, contradicting the archetype of inner nobility in poverty. And it's obvious that the Gekko-Fox duo, despite the bestial connection, plays on a father-and-son relationship as Gekko recognizes himself in Fox.Once he gets to Gekko's office, Fox knows he's given a lifetime opportunity, and plays his card well by providing resourceful information for Gekko. And Gekko is not just a mentor for the sake of it, he uses Fox to flatter his ego and his portfolio, which are both gigantic. But the price for Fox is to renounce his ethics and principles. By breaking financial secrets, Fox sells his soul, and never has the 'deal with the devil' expression been so literal. The price he put is illustrated in the following sequence: a success montage that finds the right balance between looking appealing and appalling, over the top in every meaning of the word.Fox gets a new apartment, decorated by Darlene, a fittingly tall, blonde and beautiful girl from Gekko's inner circle. The film reveals its only real handicap with the casting of Daryl Hannah, who looks in a perpetual inner conflict with the superficiality of her character. Nevertheless, the scene where she decorates the apartment mostly with fake furniture shows how far we can get in bad taste and ugliness in the name of flashy newness. It's an interesting parenthesis against modern art and the design that characterized the decadence of the 80's, consisting on filling emptiness with the weirdest, ugliest stuff that even Gekko, who buys aesthetically limited paintings, fail to grasp.And Fox embraces the 'all flash and no substance' mentality in both his work and private life, getting further and further from his roots, the price to pay: his principles, his father's respect, the reward: money, admiration, job promotion, and the blonde girl. What Fox lives is schematically pure ""Scarface"" wisdom: ""once you get the money, you get the power, and when you get the power, you get the women"", it's not just a critic of the perverse effects of the American Dream but of a system that tolerates men like Gekko. The difference between ""Scarface"" and ""Wall Street"" is that the central character paid the high price for his greed, while Fox is given a chance to redeem himself, a necessary step in his initiation. And Carl proves to be an important character as the counterpart of Gekko's mentality.It was a strike of genius to cast Martin Sheen as Charlie's father, which adds to the emotionality of certain scenes. Yet, if someone ends up respecting Carl more than Gekko, it's still Michael Douglas's Oscar-winning performance that carries the film. Douglas made Gordon Gekko strangely fascinating. And if I'm not sure Gekko was meant to encourage vocations but maybe his 'Greed' quote served as a philosophical alibi to all the people who probably ruined the world 20 years later. But isn't the devil always charming and Gekko only incarnating to the core the style of the greatest screen villains, earning a #24 spot in AFI's Top 50 list.And ""Wall Street'"" follows such a rich plot line with a pedagogic value on finance, that it needed a first-rate old fashioned villain to impact memories. The film has its flaws, Hannah's casting, an unforgivable reference to Challenger's explosion when the film takes place in 1985, but all in all, ""Wall Street"" is fresh, modern and remains one of the most significant movies of the 80's.",Wall Street
36,paul2001sw-1,"Entertaining, but lightweight",7,22 June 2011,"Oliver Stone made 'Wall Street' in 1987 against a backdrop of mounting concern about the influence of an aggressively self-interested financial sector on wider society; in many ways, it seems that nothing has changed. The film is a parable about insider trading and the activity of speculators, vaguely plausible but clumsily acted and the strokes are painted with a broad brush. That it's not more precise in its representation of the workings of the markets can perhaps be forgiven; less so, its imprecision in language. For all the celebrated lines (mostly obviously, when Gordon Gekko, the character played by Michael Douglas, declares ""Greed is good""), I couldn't help but wonder what a truly talented scriptwriter, a playwright like David Hare or David Mamet, could have done with this material. The 80s haircuts are predictably hilarious, and Charlie Sheen's protagonist far from likable; the sting that traps Gekko feels particularly flimsily sketched, although the story doesn't shy away from ending on a hard note. Stone is never the subtlest of film makers; a film about the more recent generation of quantitative analysts, who have partly supplanted the likes of Gekko (but with equally disastrous effects), might have been more to my taste for movies with a cooler tone.",Wall Street
37,g-bodyl,Fantastic Movie!,8,17 April 2011,"Wall Street is a very good movie by Oliver Stone. I'm sure this movie has gotten many young people in the finance world so they could follow in the steps of Charlie Sheen's character. I thought that this movie would be kind of boring but I found myself enjoying this movie very much.This is about a young stockbroker who dreams to succeed in life and at his job. When he meets Gordon Gekko, his dreams becomes reality...or do they? The acting is brilliant. Michael Douglas dazzles with his amazing performance of Gekko. Both Sheens(Charlie and Martin) do very well in their roles. However I did find Daryl Hannh miscast.Overall, this is a great movie. I hope the sequel is just as good.

39,secondtake,"It doesn't matter if greed is good, the movie is not.",6,1 March 2010,"Wall Street (1987)I finally got to watch Wall Street after hearing many friends mention it, and a few really praise it. So with expectations a little bit primed, I was underwhelmed by the opening minutes, and then further discouraged as it went, until by the end I was bored. Maybe the sweeping notion of a Wall Street made of day traders and pyramid schemers and run-of-the-mill corrupt young white collar criminals is old hat. Maybe this had meaning in the Reagan years when greed really did seem to be waved like a flag.But maybe it's not such an amazing movie. It is filmed like a good, night time television series, though with a longer pulse to it (no commercials, oddly enough, given the theme). But it is brightly lit and functionally photographed. The acting is all over the place, but the lead, the younger Sheen, is just plain dull. His character, Bud Fox, is meant to be a hard driven risk-taker, conniving to see the top trader in town and wanting to succeed behind his little computer, but he's kind of an everyman instead, probably so we might sympathize with him. Just from his lack of energy, he drags the movie down.Michael Douglas, however, pulls it up. He's his usual brash, sharp-voiced, arrogant, rich man (he seems to play parts that require expensive suits). Unlike his father, he doesn't do humble well, but his part as Gordon Gekko requires mostly hubris. And greed. The famous ""Greed is Good"" speech never actually has him say that--and if you find it and listen just to that moment in the movie, you might get a flavor for the whole thing, because he hesitates on just how to word it. The movie, as a whole, though never pausing in the kinetic sense, is one big hesitation. It lacks depth, and it lacks any reason that we should be compassionate.Yes, the older Sheen shines (ouch, that was unintentional--Martin plays the father of the Charlie main character). The supporting cast is fair to middling. And the direction, whatever you think of Oliver Stone, is solid but uninspired. It is really the idea that drives the whole enterprise, and the idea is a linear, and predictable, one.",Wall Street
40,kenjha,Douglas is Main Attraction,7,22 March 2011,"A young stockbroker uses insider trading information to make it big on Wall Street. With his heavy-handed approach, Stone attempts to make the biggest movie about whatever topic he tackles, and here he goes for the most epic drama about the financial markets. Unfortunately, there isn't enough material here to support the epic length and the film becomes bogged down by devoting too much screen time to financial dealings. The film belongs to Douglas, who is simply terrific in his Oscar-winning role of a corporate big shot whose motto is ""Greed is good."" Charlie Sheen is fine as a young broker Douglas takes under his wings. It's not clear what Hannah is doing here.",Wall Street
41,The-Sarkologist,This movie ended up having the opposite effect to what it intended,6,30 December 2013,"Normally I would write a commentary on a movie within a few days of seeing it, however I have made an exception to this film because I really don't want to go through the bother of trying to find it again, and then sitting through two hours that the film takes to reach its conclusion. It is not that it is a bad movie, but rather it is a movie that I am not really all that interested in watching again. The only reason that I ended up watching this movie again (I have seen it twice now) was because I wanted to watch it before watching the sequel.We all know what this movie is about, and in fact this movie ended up creating a culture on Wall Street, with the style of shirt that Gordon Gecko wears being called a Gecko, and the phrase 'Greed is good' being bandied about. What is generally forgotten though is that the actual phrase is 'for lack of a better word, greed is good'. Rather surprising coming from a film whose intention is to actually criticise the casino culture of Wall Street, and the fact that people are stepping over the boundaries of illegality for the sack of greed. I guess though that the Wall Street millionaires that ended up watching this film probably did not see their actions actually being illegal (even though, like Gordon Gecko, they were practising insider trading and asset stripping companies – acts which in the end put Gordon Gecko behind bars).Unlike the sequel, which was made in response to the Global Financial Crisis, the original was made during one of Wall Street's hey days, when the market was going up and many people believed that the sky was the limit. However within a year the entire edifice would end up coming under strain when the Savings and Loans scandal hit and caused a stockmarket crash, followed by a recession, in America. Still, nobody learnt from their mistakes, and even before the crash on 08, there were a number of other crashes (and recessions) that preceded it.The other problem with films criticising Wall Street is, as I said, the Wall Street bankers generally do not take much notice of it, and those who do, generally do not have much influence to actually do anything about it. On the other hand those of us plebs who watch this film are reminded that those people in their ivory towers may be living the good life, but it does not last forever, and sometimes, having a clear conscience, is much better than having more money that you know what to do with.",Wall Street
42,Rodrigo_Amaro,A Powerful Story About Greed And Other Deceptions,10,13 September 2010,"""Wall Street"" is the movie that placed the Yuppie generation in the cinema map; after that the excessive, greedy and luxurious behavior was presented few other times in ""The Bonfire of the Vanities"" (1990) and ""American Psycho"" (2000) and a few other titles too. ""Wall Street"" was the perfect story for Michael Douglas shows some very interesting acting skills in a role of a lifetime. In 1985 Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) a young and obstinate down on luck stockbroker works very hard to fulfill his dreams and make good deals in Wall Street. When he has the gold opportunity of his life making a huge deal with the powerful corporate raider Gordon Gekko (Douglas) things are about to get bigger, better and Buddy wants all and more. Gordon teaches many valuable lessons to the so far honest Bud and this young man is becoming more and more interested in everything surrounding Gordon. What Bud doesn't realize is that with all the money, the power, the women and many other things comes also the corrupt side of his job, the use of illegal methods; the dishonesty of betraying other people while doing business and that might include his own father (Martin Sheen). This Magnus opus about the excessive and ruthless effects of the Capitalism on people in a dog-eat-dog world marked a whole generation that seemed to have enjoyed many of the mannerisms and the attitudes of the main characters of this film. Although many viewers will complain about the 1980's style and technology this film is not so dated both in behavior and some ethical and unethical principles that can be learned from here.The screenplay works brilliantly, the characters are well written and well presented and it is accurate about the stockbrokers language (this part was very rare at that time and it is a interesting part of the film, though it might bore some people who wants to understand the technical aspects of the sales). The quotes presented here are memorable and it really makes this movie better and better. The 'Greedy' speech made by Gekko is the most remarkable in the film; the one delivered by the veteran and honest stockbroker Lou Manheim (Hal Holbrook) is one of the most enigmatic quotes ever and it says a lot about Sheen's character: ""Man looks in the abyss. There's nothing staring back at him. At that moment man finds his character. And that is what keeps him out of the abyss."" Makes you wonder!One of the greatest moments of Oliver Stone on filmmaking, one of his best pictures ever, he did a terrific job. The biggest triumph here is Michael Douglas performance playing this tough, cruel, gigantic corporate raider, who hates to lose money and has a interesting and frightening personal philosophy: ""If you want a friend buy a dog"", ""Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right, greed works."" or ""Lunch is for wimps"". Gordon is an iconic character that modeled many others in film history and perhaps even in real life.

The interpretations of both Charlie Sheen who played as Bud Fox and Michael Douglas who played as Gordon Gekko, were simply outstanding and their different personalities made this movie even better.

44,Dr_Coulardeau,Speculation versus productive work,10,4 June 2007,"Be nostalgic and look at the twin towers. That was the time of the golden boys and the full liberation of Wall Street from nearly all control.The film avoids as much as possible the sentimental side of things and concentrates on the financial depth of the business. There is a slight touch of romanticism with the cover-girl, sorry home decorator. There is a little bit more feeling with the father, maybe because the father is playing the father and the son is playing the son, though it remains essentially business, in this case, union business for the father and speculating business for the son.Then there is nothing but buying and selling, owning and dumping, saving and killing, and the game is only pleasant if it is always both and all together. To kill one by saving another and to buy one in order to make the other sell, and then buy him out.Even the police and justice are used that way. I, the big financial mogul, expose you to the police to humiliate you, the ambitious broker I, the dollar god, have trained into aggressive speculation, and I, the huge and bullying financial mogul, have you, the irritating interfering small wall street selling and buying servant, arrested, but then you, disgusting faithless and unloyal fink, trap me, the trustworthy respectable treacherous redundant traitor, for the police with a tape-recorder and you, unworthy turd of stinking cheese from France, will get a rap, or even only a slight and light tap, on the fingers from the judge while I, the perambulating bouquet of New York Stock Exchange roses, will be railroaded to prison. When you, miserable dreamer, know that I, genial conqueror, was the one who wanted to kill a certain company that you, despicable vermin and louse, decided to save by having it bought by the sworn enemy of me, the visionary financial expander, you, both the broker and the audience, understand what inside-business, and inside-dealing, and inside-embezzling, and inside-anything-you-want, mean all of them together and separately.Just read or watch American Psycho, Unrated Version, and you will have the schizophrenic reading of the same situation. This film is maybe slightly too technical, especially with the financial lingo that drowns us in a vertigo of un-understandable words, but it is the way we are totally messed up in our lives by a bunch of psychopaths who have enough money to buy the federal government out of the federal reserve at Fort Knox, or vice versa, which might even be funnier. As Gekko said so simply:""You're not naive enough to think we are in a democracy. It's the free market.""And that was under Reagan, not yet Trump. Imagine Trump's second term. Nothing, to lose, but so much to loot when he could have gotten loose. And the Twin Towers are still gone, but the Twin Towers were not even a symbol. Just a baiting target.And we are the bait to catch the fish, or the fish caught by the hook, or even maybe nothing but the hook itself with the fish on it to catch the shark. The shark?

45,johnnyboyz,"Often gripping drama, which rewards the investment of one's time with a grand dividend",8,31 May 2008,"How much is, indeed, enough? For certain characters in Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"", nothing is ever quite enough - more must always be sought, opportunities endlessly pursued - there is not, after all, any final digit to which we can call count. 'Greed', it is said, '...is good'; greed 'works', but surely the misstep here is grammatical - what is it when greed has already worked: a million dollars is a lot of money, but when, for one particular character in the film, it is the difference between fifty and fifty one, it is little more than a statistic. And yet, they cannot help themselves; they do what they do purely because they are able to - what other life do they know?""Wall Street"" begins with bouncy crooner music over a montage of the Manhattan skyline, but this gives way to a series of shots on the ground-level of exasperated looking commuters packing into crowded trains and negotiating busy streets first thing in the morning. The effect is one of juxtaposition, or at least of comparison - happiness exists in this place, but it isn't down here with these people, it is up in the high-rises and the clouds. We meet our lead Buddy Fox (Charlie Sheen), whose workplace when he first enters it seems deliberately shot from a wide-angle to emphasise busyness and mess - it is designed to intimidate us; over-raw us. Fox is in the share dealing business, but, perhaps to our surprise, he is a salesperson - hired to cold-call people in order to get them on the brokerage firm's books and investing. Around him lie examples of failure: fellow employees twice his age who are without success. One striking later composition sees a vagrant and a yuppie standing side-by-side on a street corner and we are asked by a character if each of them are where they are because of luck. Success and failure have the potential to push you to either extreme in this town.Being young and ambitious, Fox has his eye on a prize he just knows will lead him onto the next level: a self-made millionaire by the name of Gordon Gecko (Michael Douglas), who is kept out of sight until we understand he is the sort of person who would try to make financial gain off the back of something like Challenger disaster; is elusive enough to have turned Fox down several times already and had a 'moral bypass' at birth. An opportunity arises, however, on Gecko's birthday to infiltrate the man's offices and begin pitching stock ideas to him. One of them is an airline Buddy's father just-so happens to work for, an investment suggestion he wouldn't even have were it not for a recent fleeting conversation, and so we sense Bud is punching above his weight even from an early point in this respect.The essence of the film, from these beginnings, goes on to depict the relationship between these two men - their ups; their downs; their professional association. Fox eventually falls in with an interior designer played by Daryl Hannah, but it is really about the bond between the two men: one loves his money, the other has this man's money in his hands and must accumulate more for him. Gecko says so himself that one particular payday was 'better than sex', inferring a correlation between fertility and the accumulation of capital. Later, we shrug when the bimbo walks out - it isn't about her - but take a sharp inhalation of breath when the two guys confront one another in a public park. Gecko may be married, but we barely notice that either.Early success for Fox brings him a sexual encounter with a woman in a limousine, organised by Gecko as a sort of perverse reward; Gecko's world is enticing, his affluence appealing - he is able to spend eye-watering sums of money on art and the latest in technological advancements. Later, the film explores ideas to do with how far we are willing to go to get what we truly want - epitomised in scenes whereby Fox must betray his own moral principles if it means knowing exactly what the market has the potential to do.I couldn't find very much to dislike about the film. It zips along like an action thriller, but explosions and chase sequences have been replaced by whether a stock value will go up or not. Like the industry it depicts, it doesn't wait for you to catch up - you need to know where to look when Buddy is keeping track of a price on a ticker, and you need to be paying attention to know what the number needs to be in order to know Fox is in the black. Structurally, the film reminded me of 1983's ""Scarface"" - a film Stone did not direct but wrote - in its punchy depiction of a world full of opportunity, on the one hand, but vice and potential ugliness on the other, and its characters who rise from nothing; obtain nearly everything and then learn a few inconvenient truths about the universe they've stepped into.Here, he has both written and directed something which eventually pits versions of economics against one another, with Buddy stuck in the firing line and acting as the catalyst which forces the two worlds to intercept: torn between a father and a father-figure; between those who smoke cigars and those who opt for cigarettes; between those who drink a bottled beer and those who go for red wine; between blue collar and white; between working labour and gain off the back of labour, and it is thoroughly engaging.",Wall Street
46,filipemanuelneto,An essay on greed.,8,15 December 2019,"This is a movie that revolves entirely around greed, and the harm it brings when greed for money becomes a person's reason for living. Directed well by Oliver Stone, the film shows the rise and fall of Bud, a New York Stockbroker who, driven by greed, associates with Gordon Gekko, an amoral finance shark. Profits happen, and Bud's life takes a turn, but at some point he realizes that he is somehow living on the edge of his own convictions of right and wrong, and when it threatens his own father's job, Bud has to decide which side of morality he is on.The movie is loaded with moral messages about money, speculation and greed, which is good. Stone undoubtedly wanted to warn of the dangers of savage capitalism and lack of business ethics. Got. The movie makes anyone think twice before investing in the stock market.The cast of the film is strong, full of big names and each actor does a great job, in particular thanks to the good material each one received. In fact, the characters were very well made and developed intelligently. Charlie Sheen shone like Bud Fox, and has in this movie one of the most interesting roles of his career. Michael Douglas was also magnificent in a villain role where he accentuated the character's amorality and gave the film a remarkable strength and impact. He, too, got one of the most remarkable performances of his professional life, so much so that he earned him the Oscar for Best Actor that year. Martin Sheen also made a good appearance and the most emotional parts of the film are the work of the good professional collaboration between him and Charlie, who is his son in real life and also in this film. Worst of all was Daryl Hannah, in the uninspired and insipid performance of a pretty, materialistic girl.Overall, this movie is worth it for the good story it tells and the excellent performances of the actors. Morally grounded, it has aged well and continues to look current even twenty years after it was launched. And even if we hate Gekko's biased amoral philosophy (translated in his famous speech ""Greed is Good""), we cannot deny the character's magnetism, charm and attractiveness. The evil is seductive, and Michael Douglas got it very well.",Wall Street

49,TheMovieDiorama,"Wall Street endeavours in archetypal financial greed, garnering lucrative results in the process.",7,8 July 2019,"""The main thing about money, Bud, is that it makes you do things you don't want to do."". One of many sentiments, and perfectly executed speeches, that resonated with me deeply. This isn't just a generic typical finance-driven drama with unlikeable characters, stockbroker jargon and predictable conflicts of interest. There's more beneath the surface. This is an Oliver Stone picture, at the height of his success. Brush those dollar bills aside, and you'll find an intrinsic commentary on America's cultural deficit fuelled by capitalists powered solely by money and greed. Just an ordinary day in Wall Street, right? A young stockbroker yearns to encounter the legendary Wall Street player Gordon Gecko, but quickly realises that wealth and success comes at an unscrupulous dishonest price.The classic morality conflict of pitting wealth and power against honesty and nobility. The young idolising the rich and famous, and willing to take as many shortcuts as possible to reach their almighty destination. Perched at the summit of a towering skyscraper in Wall Street. The height of their power. I have to hand it to Stone for writing two very stipulating characters whilst thematically addressing 1980s narrow viewpoint of acquiring money. The onscreen competitiveness complements the relatable subtext almost perfectly, resulting in intense drama.Whilst the archetypes and conflicts between Gecko and Fox are not unsubtle, a little too on the nose to be hugely thought provoking, it's the bustling environment that they reside in that truly captivates. From Stone's claustrophobic camerawork in crammed elevators to the enraged stockbrokers at the Stock Exchange. It's a workplace that emits intensity within these characters.Obviously, most viewers now will watch this for Douglas' award-winning performance. Is it his most memorable? No. Is it worthy of the acclaim? Absolutely. There's a subtle nuance about his persona. Enabling that seamless transition from quick-witted quips to frustrated anger. However, what really impressed me was one of the most memorable speeches in cinematic history. ""Greed, for lack of a better word, is good"". Bang! Hits the nail on the head. Outstanding writing that ""captures the essence of evolutionary spirit"", executed perfectly by Douglas. It resonated with me instantaneously, and he's not wrong. This credo regarding greed is the manifestation of human desire. We all have this sin. And Stone effortlessly displays this sentiment for all of us to witness. Remarkable. Credit must be given to Sheen as well for giving a commendable and committed performance alongside his father. Scenes with just the two of them were palpable.Unfortunately however, and it brings me to many criticisms, Hannah was terrible. In fact, her whole character was so underdeveloped, that removing her from the picture would have no effect to the overall story. Unique interior design skills aside, Darien was just a product of secondary success, clinging onto the back of her former lovers. It doesn't add anything to the plot. She's not a lustful plot device capable of persuading Bud to venture into industrial espionage, he made his choice all by himself. She's not an asset for Gecko. She literally has no purpose, and that's frustrating. A male dominated Wall Street needed a better written female character. The plot's climax wasn't hugely satisfying either. I understand why Stone left it open-ended, but considering how closely we've been following this insider trading scheme, it left me desiring a better finish. Oh, and why was it that I kept thinking ""this awfully sounds like 'Spyro the Dragon'""? My man Stewart Copeland was heading up the score, that's why! Fantastic composition as always.For what it's worth, Wall Street's representation of the conflict between working class citizens and cutthroat businessmen was exemplary. Bolstered by sterling performances from Sheen and Douglas, just a dire shame that its lack of subtlety and only female character were misguided.",Wall Street

51,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Money + Michael Douglas = Root of all evil,7,21 April 2009,"Welcome to the high-flying stock-trading world of ""Wall Street"" as seen through the eyes of Oliver Stone. The Oscar-winning ""Platoon"" director's Charlie Sheen follow-up is not so much an insider (please excuse the pun) look at the stock market, but the journey of a young stockbroker through the joys and perils of getting rich the dirty way-- and then ultimately the consequences.The protagonist is Bud Fox (Sheen) who dreams of being a big player in the market one day. He sparks that dream by bagging a rich investor named Gordon Gekko (Douglas), who is so impressed by Fox's persistence and advice that he takes him under his wing and makes him a ton of cash. Although Fox has to get over the slightly obvious illegal hump of sure-money investments, it's not long before he climbs his way to the top and he begins to think differently (and corruptly) about the world.This is a film about the delusion of wealth and the corruption it breeds, about how making money and staying true to certain convictions don't usually go hand and hand -- as Fox learns the hard way when he enlists Gekko's help to turn around his father's employer, an airline company (certainly amusing in a 21st century context).""Wall Street"" boasts an iconic performance by Michael Douglas as Gekko. He really milks the part for what it is, getting to be sleazy, arrogant and spouting off advice like every word is gold. It's really the role that launched him into more serious roles. He certainly keeps the film's intensity up when all the stock jargon can really drag it down to the average viewer. Naturally, people who understand the market better will have more invested (yep, that's two) in ""Wall Street"" and like it better. Still, it tells a story that Americans need to hear as a reminder of arrogance of democracy and how if we're not careful, we can fall down the same slippery slopes. If nothing else, the age old idea of money not buying happiness is reinforced.",Wall Street

53,Captain_Couth,"Oliver Stone, Film maker.",9,11 May 2005,"Wall Street (1987) is one of the films that defines the 80's American Lifestyle. A dog eat dog society fueled by greed, materialistic possessions, excess and drugs. People preying on others, a world of unscrupulous inside trading and the rise of yuppies. Oliver Stone is one of those film makers who knew the 80's inside out. People say John Hughes defined the 80's but Mr. Stone showed it's true side and it was ugly. The film follows a low level day trader (Charlie Sheen) who strives to become a very powerful figure on Wall Street like his idol Gordon Geckko (Michael Douglas). To justify his rise to power, he uses his father (Martin Sheen) knowledge of the flight industry for his own personnel gains. He wants to get his foot into the door of the oily Geckko. Will he sell his soul for a quick buck? How far and fast will this rising star soar? To find these answers check out Wall Street.This film was made immediately after Platoon. Stone made it clear that he wasn't going to let an Oscar winning malaise effect him. He explores the two fathers theme that he used in Platton and once again makes it work.

56,mjneu59,just another sledgehammer soap opera,4,14 January 2011,"Oliver Stone's follow-up to his Oscar winning 'Platoon' moves through a different battleground: the high-tech jungle of corporate takeovers and insider stock trading scams. Not unpredictably, the film shows the same dizzy, kinetic intensity as its predecessor, and the same unfortunate reliance on ham-handed melodramatic exposition. Some of it couldn't be avoided: few laymen can pretend to understand the mechanics of high finance (not to mention its arcane language and customs), forcing Stone to depend on simple, stock characters and distracting camera pyrotechnics, with his lens constantly dipping and rising over even the most banal dialogue passages (at one point the screen isn't able to contain all the visual hype, and splits into multiple images). Stone's screenplay, like his overdressed cosmetic style, is too quickly and too often sidetracked into histrionic overkill, but the film at least earned Michael Douglas a well-deserved Academy Award for his energetic reading of a one-dimensional villain role.",Wall Street
57,MaxBorg89,Greed is good?,8,16 October 2010,"Oliver Stone's Wall Street is perhaps the best - though not in terms of overall quality - example of how his more interesting work combines a very personal touch with an accessible Hollywood style. Just a year before, he'd pulled off Platoon, an Oscar-winning masterpiece that some regard as the ultimate depiction of the Vietnam war precisely because its very classic story - that of a soldier losing his innocence amidst all the brutality - is rooted in the director's own combat experiences. Wall Street takes that same template - and the same leading man, Charlie Sheen - and applies it to 1980s corporate America, again with a more personal connection for Stone: his father Lou was a stockbroker during the 1929 market meltdown, and the filmmaker dedicated his attack on capitalism to his recently deceased parent.Not surprisingly, father figures play a major part in the movie's script, as the young and ambitious Bud Fox (Sheen), a young broker who, in his desperate quest for the top, is torn between the values of his father Carl (the actor's real-life dad Martin), a blue-collar union president, and those of his personal hero, one Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas), whose ethos is best summed up by the famous phrase ""Greed, for want of a better word, is good"". Bud sticks to that same philosophy and appears to enjoy all the perks - money and a hot girlfriend (Daryl Hannah) that come with it, but his new lifestyle, which also includes some less legal activities, gradually drifts his apart from his family and his former colleagues (John C. McGinley, Hal Holbrook), until he realizes something has to be done about Gekko and his unorthodox methods.Deftly combining style (just look at the use of split-screen) and substance, the film pulls off the remarkable trick of providing a sufficiently in-depth portrait of the workings of the stock market while always focusing on the human story at its core, thus enabling the audience to relate to the characters without necessarily understanding everything they're talking about. Its sharp look at the more cynical attitude of the '80s remains very relevant to this day, adding to the timeless feel of the story while at the same time grounding the content in a very specific context, paving the way for some heavy criticism of the yuppie mentality (see also a rather different take on the matter, namely Bret Easton Ellis' ferociously satirical American Psycho).And there lies the movie's greatest paradox: its open critique of quick-buck traders was (and is) misinterpreted by people who claim to have begun a Wall Street career because of the Gekko character, an ironic fact since he's the ""villain"" of the piece. The paradox can be explained by the fact that, shady as he may be, Gekko remains a riveting screen presence, justly rewarded with a Best Actor Oscar for Douglas, who truly established himself as a bona fide star with this picture and eats up every single scene he's in. Not that it's all about him: the two Sheens supply most of the emotional content, while McGinley and Holbrook are excellent sources of comic relief and elderly wisdom respectively. And Terence Stamp is impeccable as always. If there's a problem - in fact, the only significant one - in this guy-dominated film, it's the women: Daryl Hannah has since gone on record stating she was miscast (hard to disagree), and Sean Young doesn't bring much to the table, either.Bottom line: Wall Street is a very good Hollywood product made with great care and a genuine passion for the material. A good story well told, paired with a riveting look at the dark side of capitalism and the stock market's very own Darth Vader: role model or hate object, Gordon Gekko is as fine an '80s character as they come.",Wall Street
58,estebangonzalez10,Michael Douglas creates one of the most memorable villains,8,29 September 2010,"¨The point is, ladies and gentleman, that greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right, greed works. Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit.¨Oliver Stone's Wall Street is a memorable film with some great performances from Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen. Michael won the Oscar for his portrayal of Gordon Gekko, a very greedy corporate businessman who will be remembered among the best villains Hollywood has created. He is not your typical villain, Gekko has the respect of many people and under his expensive business suits and his sly fox-like smile lies a man who's greed and lust for money has left thousands of people out of jobs. He personifies the evil that can be hidden in Wall Street, as Hal Holbrook's character warns Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) ¨ the main thing about money is that it makes you do things you don't want to do.¨ This is exactly what has happened to Gordon who only cares about money and he really doesn't care at what expense it comes to his other fellow human beings. The only goal for him is to continue making more money because as he puts it greed is good and it's the only way America will improve its economy. Stone has created a memorable character in Gekko because he actually believes he's doing the right thing and that economy is just a game where some win and others lose, but it's actually more than that and his greed has blinded him. His character serves as a warning for all the people in Wall Street because that is where money can lead you, but not everyone is bad and in a way Holbrook's character represents the good in Wall Street. You have to give credit to Stone who in a way pictured what was going to happen in the future if more people like Gekko ran Wall Street. I'm no expert in economy, but I still found this movie very interesting thanks to a good screenplay written by Stone and Stanley Weiser, and some great performances from the cast (excepting Daryl Hannah who was miscast in this film).Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) is a young stockbroker who is having a difficult time making it to the top of the firm he is working for. He dreams of one day meeting Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) an extremely successful broker in New York who has become one of the most powerful men in Wall Street, and who Bud totally idolizes. He insists on meeting him and calls his secretary every day trying to arrange a meeting. He finally meets Gekko with the excuse that he is bringing him a present for his birthday and gives him a heads up on buying stock from an airline company. Bud has some inside information about Bluestar Airlines because his father, Carl (Martin Sheen), works there so Gordon takes an interest in Bud for his persistence. Gekko takes him under his wing and teaches him a thing or two about being a broker. The first rule is never to take risks; he tells Bud ¨ I don't throw darts at a board. I bet on sure things. Read Sun-Tzu, The Art of War. Every battle is won before it is ever fought.¨ This means that Gordon doesn't actually play it fair in the market and only buys stocks depending on the information he gathers about a certain company. Bud soon begins to play the same game and finds ways to illegally gather information for Gordon and quickly begins to rise in the firm he works at. Hal Holbrook plays one of his bosses from the firm who actually tries to give him some good advice. His rise to the top may come at a great price however because money easily made can easily go as well.Wall Street is a very smart drama/thriller that stands out because it has some great characters that we can identify with. Michael Douglas is at his best playing Gordon and the scene where he gives the speech about money and greed is just memorable, Charlie Sheen is also great in his role as an aspiring stockbroker who wants to succeed in what he does. He is so blinded by his worshiping of Gekko that he does things he probably never would've thought of doing before. He wants to become Gordon so bad that he doesn't realize that what he is doing is wrong. He actually thinks he isn't hurting anyone in the process. At one point he has a serious conversation with his father about his job and Carl tells him to ¨ stop going for the easy buck and start producing something with your life. Create, instead of living off the buying and selling of others. ¨ In a way it might be the advice Oliver Stone was trying to give us about Wall Street, too much greed could end up bringing the downfall of the entire system. This is a great movie whether you are into economics or not and can be enjoyed for the performances alone. I don't know much about economics and stocks, but I still found this movie highly entertaining with some great characters so I recommend this.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Wall Street

Good supporting cast includes Sean Young, James Spader, reliable Hal Holbrook, and the wonderful Sylvia Miles.  Tight direction, perceptive script with realistic techno-lingo, fabulous production design, dazzling cinematography of the Manhattan skyline, and hip 80's music rev up the technical quality of this Oliver Stone ""message"" film.  If only the message had been more reassuring.Gekko is a villain and an outlaw, but mostly he comes across to viewers as a worldly tough guy, a charming bully with a glamorous lifestyle.  We see his high-class mega-office, his plush home and chic wife, his expensive paintings, his rapid-fire commands to his robotic lieutenants, his snazzy clothes and ""in vogue"" friends.  Here and there we see his frustrations, but that only accentuates his toughness.  We do not see him suffer, nor do we see the consequences of his selfish, Machiavellian behavior.As a result, to viewers, especially to those youthful, bright, materialistic Americans with a smug, ""can do"" attitude, and disdain for ethics, Gekko is, unfortunately, someone to admire, a Wall Street role model.",Wall Street

61,jimbo-53-186511,Cool and well-staged but also a tad alienating,4,21 July 2016,"Young and ambitious stockbroker Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) hits the big time when he ends up going under the wing of ruthless, but highly successful stockbroker Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas). Gekko takes Fox under his wing and helps Fox to become a wealthy and successful stockbroker, but do wealth and power ultimately come at a price? The first 15 minutes or so of this film are explosive and extremely fast-paced and Oliver Stone certainly helps to give us an insight into stockbroking and the world of commodity sales etc. On the one hand this is interesting and sets the stage well for things to come, but on the other hand (to someone like me who knows nothing about the world of stockbroking), the rapid fire dialogue and early segments of the film make it difficult to ascertain what's actually going on? Does any of this have any relevance to the story or is Stone merely showing off? I'll let you be the judge of that.Another problem with the rapid fire script is that it doesn't really allow the characters much room to breathe (both Gekko and Fox always felt a bit one-dimensional to me and the script never seemed to allow much room for development). As a result of these things I found Wall Street to be well-made but also quite an alienating experience. If this had been presented in a less 'showy' manner then this could have proved to have been an interesting character study, but as mentioned before the flashy script never manifests itself in this manner and it ultimately leaves Wall Street feeling a bit superficial at times.The performances between Douglas and Sheen are both excellent and do make the film a little bit stronger; Douglas at this point in his career almost felt born for this role. The father/son dynamic between the Sheens was OK, but again probably would have been stronger if it had been given a bit more focus. I also thought that the ending was good and from a 'moral' perspective I felt that it was probably the best way to wrap it up.Wall Street is by no means a terrible film and does offer some interesting commentary by the time the credits roll around, but Stone's presentation in the main is a little too flashy and at times the film comes across as being a bit pretentious. It's an easy film to admire, but it's a little too cold and clinical to be enjoyed from an emotional perspective.",Wall Street

Michael Douglas's performance as Gekko won a deserved Oscar in 1988 and makes ""Wall Street"" required viewing.There are two schools of thought when it comes to money. Some economists argue money is an expanding resource, and prosperity a rising tide that lifts all boats. For Gekko, the truth is simpler and more brutal: The rich get richer off the backs of everyone else. ""Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred,"" he tells his young protégé Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen).No question writer-director Oliver Stone feels the same way, as he presents this tale of wealth acquisition at its very apex, lower Manhattan circa 1985. In practically every frame showcasing the opulent world Gekko travels can be glimpsed beggars, fishermen, window washers, people who never will have access to the white-collar lifestyles their lowly status perversely enables for others.For some, this zero-sum take of America clouds their enjoyment of ""Wall Street"" the movie. It shouldn't. You don't have to buy Shakespeare's version of history in ""Richard III"" to enjoy the morally bankrupt character at its center, and you don't need to adopt Stone's philosophy to enjoy Gekko.In fact Stone's attitude about the Street, presented here as a kind of Hogarth caricature, helps make the film so entertaining. He captures the scenes of floor trading and calls and puts in journalistic detail, but leaves room for the human equation. And he has fun, a lot of fun, especially with Gekko, a character who makes you laugh with his pithy comments even as he sets about using poor Fox as a human ashtray.On an upcoming charity event for the Bronx Zoo: ""That's the thing about WASPs. They hate people, but they love animals."" On a rival: ""If he was in the funeral business, no one would ever die!"" To Fox: ""You had what it took to get into my office, sport, the question is do you have what it takes to stay.""Fox wants to stay, and allows no SEC regulation to block his wayward path. Stone's father was a stockbroker, and so the director takes special care to show us that all Wall Streeters aren't bad. There's Hal Holbrook, almost too saintly and somewhat detached from day-to-day business of his brokerage house to the point he seems a slumming B-school don. John C. McGinley delivers a standout performance as a vulgar, greedy friend of Fox's who we nevertheless find ourselves sympathetic to, especially as Fox ditches him for Gekko.But of course it's really Gekko's world, as we watch him at his desk, punching telephone-line buttons and encouraging subordinates to ""rip their throats out,"" checking his blood pressure with one hand while smoking a cigarette in the other. His centerpiece moment, his speech to the stockholders at Teldar Paper, is a compelling soliloquy not because it showcases his brutality but because it allows him a chance to explain his philosophy in a way that sounds logical, even honorable, until you think through the implications. That's Stone's screen writing at its best.Sheen is also masterful in his role, playing the naive waif who wants to swim with the sharks and thus giving Douglas daylight to run. Too bad there's a tacked-on romance that never really works, in part because the character of Darien Taylor is not well developed, in part because Darryl Hannah hadn't yet met Quentin Tarantino. The ending is a bit too neat, and loses the subtlety that makes the rest of the film so good.But the heck with subtlety when you have Gordon Gekko. Douglas is the reason for watching ""Wall Street,"" and a terrific one. Just watch the way he looks at Bud, eyebrows raised to hold a pregnant silence, or enjoys the discomfort of his arbitrager-rival Sir Larry (a solid Terence Stamp).

Have we learned anything? Charlie Sheen is excellent, and never looked better (at this point he was not as marred by his celebrity). While the young son is worried about Rolexes and how to make skim money from shareholders, Martin Sheen as his father at the airline, which will soon be decimated by Gordon Gekko (well portrayed by Douglas). The scene with his father in the elevator is brilliant; as Budd Fox (Charlie Sheen) is quoting Gekko's mantras, Martin Sheen replies: ...""I never judged a man by the size of his wallet""...; so sad and true. The two generations at odds about lifestyles and careers. Martin Sheen also quotes the Bible; regarding false prophets, he basically tells his son the same rape and pillage has gone on for centuries; very well-written.Oliver Stone presents everything in a filtered, other-worldly haven; sushi; the ten million dollar NYC apartment (I have allowed for inflation), a beach house in the Hamptons, this is after all the American dream. We are supposed to cheat, steal, maim and kill to get it.We see Gordon Gekko's wife (Sean Young) a nice ornamental symbol of his success. Even his child who is briefly seen, may as well be another consumer product (just like the robot toy he buys for his son). Darryl Hannah was a perfect choice as the unfazed one-dimensional decorator, hooking up with Sheen for awhile (until he loses his money that is).The sets and characters are priceless, including the crude NY realtor salivating over her commission as Sheen picks out his first Upper East Side apartment. Look for John C. McGinley as a young arrogant trader (too funny) Hal Holbrook as the traditionalist. Terence Stamp is excellent as Sir Larry Wildman, who is a robber baron, but still has some conscience (as opposed to Gordon Gekko) Overall though, Charlie Sheen was never better; James Spader also has a brief cameo.Everyone who missed the 80's should watch this film. For those of us who survived, we can breathe a sigh of relief, and those who think corporations will take care of them in ten years, will be in for a rude awakening.

He shuns his blue collar background in pursuit of greed and impatiently engages in illegal insider trading. The 80's was characterized by hotshot young executives looking for the quick and easy buck, and Oliver Stone portrayed that very well here. Gordon Gekko is the benchmark corporate villain, someone who one see's the world only in shades of green. The acting in this movie is first rate, especially from Michael Douglas. The long lines of dialogue, the speeches, and the emotional undertones are a challenge for any actor, and all involved here did an excellent job. I often watch ""Wall Street"" just for the acting.Probably an undervalued asset to this film is one of my favorites, John C. McGinley whom you'll remember as one of the Bob's from Office Space and his role of Dr. Cox on Scrubs. Always there to heckle and mock his good friend and has some of the best one-liners in the movie. Actually three of the main five lines people quote from this movie can all be attributed to this character he developed. The dealing room-scenes are some of the most exhilarating scenes in the history of cinematography. Spielberg sucked in audiences with his scenes of Normandy's beaches in '44. Stone creates the same spellbinding grip on the audience without getting anybody shot or brutally maimed. That alone is a great achievement for any director in Hollywood.

Both Sheens (playing father and son) do credible, faintly nuanced work; Hannah is dull as dishwater as Bud's materialistic girlfriend (most involved in the film agreed she was woefully miscast). But Douglas walks away with the film--and an Oscar--delivering several memorable monologues and finding that right mix of charisma and venality that makes Gekko so understandably envied or loathed (depending on the character's viewpoint). The final confrontation between the leads (and subsequent fallout) rings false, and the scenes with younger Sheen and Hannah are yawners, but there's enough dramatic sizzle here for a solid recommendation. Strange how Stone created two very memorable 80s villains (Gekko and Tony Montana) that are viewed in some circles as aspirational figures of the American Dream!73/100",Wall Street
70,dunmore_ego,Up against The Wall.,7,13 August 2011,"Veteran stockbroker Gordon Gekko wakes upstart stockbroker Bud Fox in the middle of the night with a phone call, to remind him the Hong Kong markets are open: ""Money never sleeps, pal!"" WALL STREET is a powerful albeit slightly cheesy look at the inside of insider trading. Co-writer/director Oliver Stone, with his characteristic insider knowledge on his filmic subject, conveys another wider world out there that we are not always privy to; amongst the cloying office environments, frenetic relationships and insecure personalities, the people of Wall Street do that mysterious thing they do with imaginary money that isn't theirs - illegally, unethically and with a plastic 80's soundtrack.Bud (Charlie Sheen) is a hungry young stockbroker in a bull pen who dreams of breaking out into something more substantial. Rampant charging corporate bull Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) is on the pedestal Bud would like to inhabit. Through persistence, Bud gets a five-minute meeting with Gekko, to try and land a position as agent for him. Gekko is unimpressed - until Bud lets slip some ""insider information"" about an airline company that piques Gekko's buy-and-chop-up instincts.Bud's dad, Carl (coincidentally, Martin Sheen) is a union boss at that airline, which is how Bud ""just knew"" it was ripe for the picking. The elder Sheen brings a stately ease to his role, paternally looking down his nose at Sheen The Younger, both in real life and in character, calling him a ""salesman"" when Bud insists he is an ""account executive, soon to move onto investment banking."" When young Bud asks Carl for a loan, Carl inquires of Bud's $50K Manhattan job, ""Where does it all go?"" Bud breaks down his payments on car, apartment, suits, etc. to make him look like the richie he aspires to be, ironically adding, ""There is no nobility in poverty any more, dad."" WALL STREET truly is a snapshot of WASP life in the 80s; throwing themselves into the river and hoping they don't sink. It's ultimately what we've all become used to doing with our lines of credit and the powerful agitprop of capitalistic culture. Wall Street: convincing Americans that in order to grow your money you have to risk it. And dumb cluck Americans buying into the Orwellian dream.Gekko is under no illusion how he retains his powermad status. He tells the naive Bud that insider trading (the corrupt kind) is the difference between riding in a private jet and owning a private jet. He's brash (""I'll talk atcha!""), he spouts the most amusing axioms (""A fool and his money are lucky enough to get together in the first place""); he rationalizes his unethical practices (""Money itself isn't lost or made. It's simply transferred from one perception to another""); he coaches Bud in Sun Tzu's The Art Of War. In essence, Gekko tempts Bud like a modern Mephistopheles, gradually claiming more and more of Bud's soul, as Bud acquiesces to performing more dangerous and fevered favors for Gekko in the pursuit of treasure.No matter how big of a dog you think you are - there's always a bigger dog. The dog bigger than Gekko is Terence Stamp as Sir Larry Wildman. He's richer, scarier and Britisher. Gekko puts Bud on Wildman's tail for inside info, exploiting Bud's hunger and rewarding him with riches.WALL STREET is the same parable espoused in TRADING PLACES (1983): engage in insider trading, lose your shirt. That is, being drunk on power makes you as likely to screw up and go to jail as being drunk on alcohol. Bud's downfall looms as he moves into a swank penthouse apartment (decorating it in 80's Gaudy), scores a sophisticated blonde, Darien (Daryl Hannah), and develops a penchant for preparing sushi for dinner. His hubris would lead him to try brokering a deal to chop up the small airline company where his father is a union boss.Of course, the downfall of the padawan presages the downfall of the Master...By the late 80s, it was established that the richest 1 percent in America ""owns half the country."" Gordon Gekko would make a speech that would become infamous for the catch-phrase ""Greed is good,"" making it seem as 80s-dated as Adam Ant, but the speech is relevant in 2011 for various reasons. The opening phrase, ""You do it right - or you get eliminated"" is still the model for everyone in business - except the corporate dishonest who do it wrong and get rewarded (the ""Too Big to Fail"" crowd).It is ominous that even back then, director Stone and corporate raiders were acknowledging that the USA was run by corporations; what they couldn't predict was that greed would not save the corporate model but set it up for takeover by other countries with a better grasp on capitalism.""...The new law of evolution in corporate America seems to be Survival of the Unfittest. Well, in my book you either do it right - or you get eliminated... I am not a destroyer of companies. I am a liberator of them. The point is, ladies and gentlemen, that greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right. Greed works. Greed clarifies and cuts through and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit. Greed in all of its forms, greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge, has marked the upward search of mankind, and greed - you mark my words - will not only save Teldar paper but that other malfunctioning corporation called the USA."" Will that ""malfunctioning corporation"" ever learn its lesson when there's a steal-from-the-poor-and-give-to-the-rich bailout around every corner?",Wall Street
71,napierslogs,"Well made, but only interesting to those into Wall Street trading",6,2 October 2010,"Having just seen ""Wall Street"" for the first time 25 years after its setting, it does still hold up as a well done film. The desire for money, success and power is still relevant. So relevant that the few messages surrounding the greed and ills of money, might mean even more in today's society.Charlie Sheen was very effective as a young stockbroker trying to make his mark. Baby-faced, eager and somewhat naive, he actually suited the part well. As Oscar noted, Michael Douglas added depth to his character of Gordon Gekko, the ultimate investor who has all the influence that money can buy. He didn't seem at all like the Douglas that I have seen in the past - probably because he wasn't Michael Douglas but Gordon Gekko, and I hadn't met him before.My problem is that I'm just not interested in Wall Street trading, and to me, ultimately, ""Wall Street"" was rather boring. It was nice to see Oliver Stone make a fictional movie rather than a factual story which he turned fictional, but I still think it's just a film for those people who are intrigued by big-business and big-money in a high-stakes world. I'm just not one of them.",Wall Street

Only this time instead of caught between two opposing sergeants in the jungles of Vietnam, he's a Wall Street broker and his opposing sides he must choose between are his father played by his real-life father Martin Sheen and a conniving and greedy corporate executive played by Michael Douglas, who won the Oscar for Best Leading Actor the following year.""Wall Street"" shows Oliver Stone's skill and craftsmanship as a filmmaker. There's not a bad-looking or badly-done moment in the entirety of the running time. And we have some great performances, especially by Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen. However, ""Wall Street"" is not as good as ""Platoon"" simply because I'm afraid, the subject matter is not very interesting and the story is basically a standard rise and fall cliché.I have some strong praises for ""Wall Street"", however a lot of complaints as well. Apart from being able to predict the story a little too easily to be shocked or absorbed, I also didn't become so drawn into the story because I didn't feel a real connection between Charlie Sheen and either Michael Douglas or Martin Sheen. As a matter of fact, between him and the latter, the relationship seemed kind of watered down. He has no connection at all to his love interest played by Darryl Hannah; their scenes just fill up time and slow things down. But my biggest complaint is that although the movie is about greed and pride preceding the fall, frankly the business of stock broking is a little uninteresting to the casual viewer such as me. Maybe if Oliver Stone had chosen to explore a more human side to the story outside of the company walls – strengthen the relationship between Charlie Sheen and Martin Sheen and Darryl Hannah – then he would have had a better film.Nevertheless, in the end, I do give ""Wall Street"" a marginal recommendation. It's a professionally-made movie and it does hold out as an entertaining and certainly interesting picture, however the premise does wear out rather quickly. Let's put it this way: I enjoyed the picture, but I'm in no particular hurry to see it again.",Wall Street
73,blott2319-1,"Almost exactly what you'd expect, which is fine",5,18 March 2021,"I've seen plenty of clips from Wall Street over the years, because it is in the cultural zeitgeist, and watching it for the first time delivered almost exactly what I expected. There's nothing wrong with this movie, it is a perfectly acceptable look at the ugly side of stock trading. Perhaps the most surprising aspect to me was just the fact that our protagonist is willing to embrace insider trading so early on. I thought it might be a while before he was convinced to commit a felony, but this kid was ready even if it meant hurting those closest to him. One of the bigger problems with Wall Street is just the fact that Charlie Sheen is not as good an actor as virtually everyone else in the cast (with the possible exception of Daryl Hannah.) In fact, I had trouble taking him seriously because he's more suited to comedy. This is never more obvious than when he is in a scene with his father. Martin is absolutely fantastic at selling the emotional side of these rather bland business dealings. I had a strong bond to that character anyways, as he was the only likable guy in the movie. I kind of appreciated that Wall Street didn't feel the need to hold hands too much when explaining the general concept of the stock market, because I've seen other films where they don't trust the audience this much. Even with my limited comprehension of buying-and-selling, I was always tracking what was going on in this plot.

And yet, he looks out from his million dollar pad into the night down at the city of New York and says ""Who am I?"" Bud's station in the world is at a new height, thanks largely to Gordon ""Greed"" Gekko, the financial mentor and stock/real estate investor who loves ""liquid"" more than sex.""Wall Street"" is about a glimpse into the world of high stakes stock investments in NYC and how behind-the-scenes million-dollar deals affect the average person's life. A reliable and hard-working but underpaid employee of a stable company may find his job and therefore his income has disappeared--possibly overnight--when the company is traded to a new group of investors who decide to downsize the company in favor of a quick increase in stock value. And they in turn may decide to sell their shares to yet other investors who may or may not have the best interests of the company and/or their employees in mind. The free market system allows for the trading of certain companies to independent investors, and it can often be brutal for those who have the most to lose but have no influence on how the deals are struck.""Wall Street"" centers on Bud Fox, a mediocre but ambitious stock sales rep for a mid-line stock brokerage firm. His dream is to acquire clients with deep pockets that will allow him to increase his sales commissions, and maybe even end up on the other side of the phone. He dreams of having Gordon Gekko, the dapper money magnate who, as one character put it, would sell his own mother down-river for a deal, and have her delivered COD. At the movie's start, we learn that Fox has been cold-calling Gekko's office for two months, and finally, on Gekko's birthday, Fox earns the millionaire's ear and eventually his business when Fox reveals some insider information about his father's airline company. Gekko puts in a large order of the airline's stock, and when the stock price increases, he's pleased Gekko, putting Fox into the upper echelon of sales reps at his brokerage.Fox then becomes a willing pawn in a larger game where Gekko the financial chess-master moves money around the chessboard of Wall Street. But Gekko wants Buddy to do more than simply handle his stock transactions. He wants Buddy to acquire more insider information about certain companies, and even rival investors, to ensure that every stock transaction is a winner. And Gekko also has an agenda: he desires to outdo another investor magnate, Sir Laurence, who has even more liquid than Gecco with which to play the financial game. But what Fox knows is that some of what Gekko is asking him to do could be construed as insider trading, a felony...The story becomes about how Fox gets pulled into the deals of larger-than-life titanic investors, and how promises are often broken, high stake deals are hashed out, and the only God that exists is the power of unlimited amounts of liquid, a.k.a. money. There are even a couple of split screen sequences in which the news about a stock's volatility travels around the many different ears which in turn influences the price of the stock. Such rumors can either push the value of a stock up or depreciate its value, and we watch from both directions.The acting as well as the storyline are superb, with an Oscar-winning performance by Michael Douglas as the money magnate from Hell. Charlie Sheen is equally as believable as the sales rep who thought he knew a lot about Wall Street before realizing the world of high-stakes investing is a lot more complex and competitive then he ever realized. By movie's end, he comes to the conclusion that money is not everything.",Wall Street
75,KnightsofNi11,Exciting cynicism,8,29 July 2011,"Cynicism runs rampant in Oliver Stone's classic film about greed and deceit, Wall Street. Charlie Sheen stars as Bud Fox, a lowly stock broker who avidly seeks out advice from corrupt financial aficionado Gordon Gekko, played by Michael Douglas. Gekko takes Fox under his wing and shows him all the ropes in illegal business practice as the two trade on inside information in order to get to the top. It is a film filled with snappy dialogue and fancy word play that, at times, can be difficult to keep up with but not a single line goes to waste as the film moves along at a brisk and exciting pace.It is impressive how Wall Street never gets boring or dull. Here we have a film about the stock market that is brimming with all the fancy lingo of the trade and strongly focuses on the complex inner workings of the market. But the story is presented in an exciting and gripping fashion that draws in the audience whether we understand how the stock market works or not. The film keeps itself moving with important elements that drive the story, except for a fairly useless romantic subplot between Fox and Darien Taylor, a friend of Gekko's played by Daryl Hannah. Other than this the events in Wall Street keep a consistently exciting pace that moves the story along and makes it into something more than just a boring description of how Wall Street works.There is something quite frightening about this film, however. Wall Street highlights the greed and corruption that runs rampant in the market and this film was made in 1987. The film's cynical view on the world of the stock market hasn't been righted since the films release. Corruption has only grown, further verifying the film's message to the world. The stock traders of today have taken Gekko's words to heart, dwelling on the idea that ""Greed is good."" Sadly, Wall Street's relevance will probably never expire as long as their is a stock market. Corruption will never be put to rest and this film knows it, leaving us with an open ending that hardly solves any problems presented in the film. It's a dark view of the world that is only fueled by the grim truth.Wall Street is an incredibly memorable film and will certainly be hailed as one of great 80's classics for decades to come. It isn't a perfect film, but it is relevant and it is important. This is an exciting film that presents the methods of Wall Street in a presentable fashion that we can comprehend and enjoy. It makes the stock market less of a mystery to the common person, but at the price of unveiling the rampant corruption within the market. The film is as exciting as cynicism gets and it is a must see, if only for its relevance and importance to the modern world.",Wall Street
76,TOMASBBloodhound,"Neither perfect, nor subtle, but a very good film.",8,17 April 2016,"Definitely one of Oliver Stone's better films, this indictment of corporate raiders and unscrupulous stock brokers hasn't lost any of its impact since the same type of activities are still in practice, and the gap between rich and poor in the United States has never been higher. But nowadays, since Wall Street has learned to finance the Democrat Party and pay lip service in the press to liberal causes, we hear a lot less about ""wall street greed"" in the national media. Now many of them are just as hypocritical as they are greedy. But Stone's film is all about the Wall Street of its day. In other words, we get lots of suspenders, big gray cell phones, women with big hair, and shots of people smoking in public. Throw in a scene with a cheesy robot, and you have a an 80s film on your hands. Seriously, what was is with lame robots in 80s films? Rocky IV, R.O.T.O.R., Revenge of the Nerds, Short Circuit.... digressing here.The plot deals with a fresh-faced, but oily-haired Charlie Sheen working as a hustling young stock broker. He doesn't seem to be doing that well at it, he is mired in debt, and his working-class hero father doesn't respect his line of work. He spends every free minute trying to get into business with Michael Douglas, who is one of the most feared and respected traders in the business. Finally a box of Cuban cigars hand delivered on his birthday is enough to get Sheen into the door. Desperate to get on Douglas's good side, Sheen leaks some insider info about the airline his father works for. It ends up making Douglas some $$, and starts Sheen on his way quickly up the financial ladder. But as you'd expect, Sheen wants it all too fast, and he ends up not only using illegal insider trading practices, but he also ends up as a pawn in Douglas's plan to take over the the airline. You don't have to know all that much about the business to follow the story, but it helps to pay attention. There is a lot of dialogue, and most of it is important.The casting is exceptional. Charlie and Martin Sheen make a great father-son pairing. Probably better than they do in real life. Martin Sheen gets to do plenty of sermonizing about the value of hard work and whatnot, and you have to think he loved the chance to play this character. Michael Douglas gives probably his most memorable performance as the evil Gordon Gekko. ""Greed is good..."" etc... He is almost good enough to convince you his character isn't even that bad of a guy. Douglas actually rises about the character in a sense. Hal Holbrook is on hand as a veteran broker who tries to talk Sheen out of chasing the quick buck. He is always appreciated in any film. Wall Street strikes out, however, with its two main female characters. Darryl Hannah is lost as Sheen's tacked-on love interest. Its a thankless role she isn't even talented enough to handle. Honestly, why was she wearing a wet-suit in her scene on the beach. Wouldn't some kind of swimsuit have been more logical or hot? And Sean Young as Douglas's wife?? Always a train wreck, she was apparently such a problem on the set that her role was drastically reduced. Overall, a very good film though. 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Wall Street

Inevitably, the devil has all the best lines, and Douglas seizes the role with relish. Guiltily, we side with Gekko, if only it means seeing more of Douglas chewing the scenery.

(Gordon Gekko)
I will be the first one to tell you that I am not an expert at the financial system and probably will never me. If only to see the Michael Douglas performance that everyone raves about, I eventually had to give Oliver Stone's Wall Street a watch. A complete turnaround from the Oscar-winning Platoon, Stone made a film that is not so much a criticism about capitalism, but how cynical the 1980's were. The film is very intelligent, so some terms/statements flew over my head, but I got the gist. Despite that strike against me, I still found the film to be reasonably entertaining with a killer performance by Michael Douglas.Coming off the success of the war film Platoon (also starring Charlie Sheen), Stone wanted to make something different. He linked up with a friend of his named Stanley Weiser and asked him to write a screenplay about the quiz show scandals of the 1950's. During a conference, Stone decided to switch subjects and do something about the financial world. Weiser did not know much about this world (hey, like me!), so he did plenty of research. Both he and Stone did their own draft and then merged them into one tidy screenplay.Everyone's favorite corporate villain, Gordon Gekko is not modeled after one person but rather a composite of multiple people including Owen Morrisey (a friend of Stone's who was busted for insider trading in 1985), Ivan Boesky (whose Gekko's famous greed speech is based on), and Stone himself to give a couple examples. When one looks at the themes of 1980's excess and how the battle brews between wealth/power and simplicity/honesty, Gekko comes to mind. Also, how ethics and laws take a backseat in the minds of people like him. We also get a look into the minds of the other side. Bud Fox's father, Carl is a member of the working class as a union leader. He opposes mandatory drug testing or any involvement from these corporations. It is interesting to see Stone explore these dynamics especially in the eyes of someone living in the 21st century.Young Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) is a stock trader armed with ambition. He wants to be at the very top as he has been actively pursuing Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas), a stock manipulator who uses inside information to make the market meet his demands. In his now infamous speech at Teldor Paper, he lives by the motto that ""greed is good."" Gordon finally relents and takes Bud under his wings when he learns information about Blue Star Airlines, the company Carl Fox (Martin Sheen) works at. Everything comes to a head when Bud realizes how much trouble he is in when Gordon wants to take over the company and tear in apart by plundering the company's retirement fund.Stone's film has a fantastic cast, most of which lived up to or exceeded expectations. People in Hollywood warned Stone against casting Douglas as he was seen more of a ""producer"" type and not a good actor. After Romancing the Stone, Douglas wanted something darker and edgier. Along with Fatal Attraction, Douglas was having a good year. Using Stone's rapid, fast dialogue, Douglas rose to the occasion and delivered an acting masterpiece. Poor Charlie Sheen seemed like a minuscule ant next to Douglas, but I still think he delivered a decent performance. It must have been awesome acting across his father. Daryl Hannah was horribly miscast. She clearly did not want the role. She and Charlie Sheen had no sexual chemistry, and their relationship took away from the movie. On set, she would fight with her costars (namely Sean Young). The supporting performances were good; Terence Stamp as Gekko's rival, Hal Holbrook as Fox's boss, James Spader as one of the rising stars in the financial world, etc.I may not have understood everything, but Wall Street is an enticing drama. If you need a reason to watch the film, stay for Michael Douglas and his fiery speeches. Being an Oliver Stone picture, this is a well-written and rather opinionated film about the state of financial world in the 1980's. The story is told traditionally so there were really no surprises. I did think the ending felt a bit too tidy and clean. Fun fact!

84,bigverybadtom,Oliver Stone Avoids Sensationalism Here,7,13 December 2012,"The movie is based on the stories of the mid 1980's insider trading scandals which put several big financiers in jail. The movie starts just before these events, with Bud Fox, a young financier wanting to hit the big time, and he meets Gordon Gekko, an older financier who has already done so, and takes him under his wing. Using insider information about the company Bud's father works for, Bud helps Gordon make a lot of money, and Gekko rewards him well. Bud is introduced to big money, fast women, and power, and all the trappings of being rich.But Bud has not entirely abandoned his past. He introduces his working-class father to Gekko, who promises to buy the company Bud's father works for and make it work better. The father is unconvinced and reminds his son that the company's owners had struggled to make the company big, beginning with one airplane. Gordon buys the company and doesn't do as Bud had expected. What to do? It is hardly an attack on capitalism so much as the world of big money. The father's employer, after all, utilized the capitalist system to struggle for success. Also, Gekko, for all his money, has equally rich and powerful enemies, as is revealed early in the movie. And the government does get after Bud and Gekko in the end.Michael Douglas gives a great performance as Gordon Gekko; everyone else pales in comparison. And the theme of the movie is relevant today, except the stakes have gotten worse. Many of the financial controls still in place in the 1980's were legally removed since then, the largest being the repeal of the Glass-Steagal Act which limited banks to where they could place their money...and we can thank Bill Clinton for that, though he did have bipartisan support. Which is why things have become so much messier today.",Wall Street
85,virek213,"For The Love Of Money...And Greed, Of Course",9,15 October 2010,"After having shot into the top directors' circle with the Oscar-winning Vietnam War film PLATOON, director Oliver Stone could have made practically any film he wanted. But unwilling to take the easy way out and do a film strictly for the money, he instead made a film about money itself--the lure it has on us, and how it can do funny and sometimes sinister things. That film was WALL STREET, released in late 1987, and extremely timely in its day as it came out shortly after what was then the biggest financial crash in America since 1929.There's no real need to recite too much of the plot details, only to say that a hotshot young stockbroker (Charlie Sheen) falls under the spell of corporate raider Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas, in a steely performance that rightly won him the Best Actor Oscar for 1987) and thus sells out everything about himself, including the pride of his own father (Martin Sheen), for the love of money and greed. What is consistently intriguing even to this day (and something that was continued in the 2010 sequel WALL STREET: MONEY NEVER SLEEPS) is the combination of superlative acting and snappy and (unsurprisingly) sometimes profane dialog (by Stone and co-writer Stanley Weiser) in which the New York financial world is shown to be the world's biggest casino, and Douglas' Gordon Gekko, who tells the folks at Teldar Paper how he plans to resurrect that failing business in his legendary ""Greed Is Good"" speech, being the world-class dealer and destroyer.Stone can be faulted for having his two lead actresses (Daryl Hannah; Sean Young) just be like side dishes to the corporate wheeling and dealing that's being done for all to see (he would get better in this area after a while). But it never fails to see Douglas at his most chilling best as Gekko, while both Charlie and Martin Sheen give good performances as son and father now at odds; and the film also has good turns from Hal Holbrook (who almost never gave a bad performance in his life), James Karen, Terence Stamp, and, returning from PLATOON, John C. McGinley.In short, WALL STREET is as pertinent a film now in the age of corporate meltdowns as it was in the age of Reagan. It's a film that you'll never forget.",Wall Street
86,gigan-92,"""Who am I?""",10,23 January 2012,"A+ One of Oliver Stone's highlights in his career I must say. In order to truly realize what the film is about, it's not a bad idea to read up on philosophy. ""Men condemn injustice thru fear of suffering it, not thru fear of committing it"", Thrasymachus, or consider the tale of Glaucon and the ring; a story that's theme dwells on the fact that when a man has the chance to profit, he takes the chance, even at the expense of others; especially when immunity is involved. Take a gander at Plato's book ""The Republic"" and this film will become that much more meaningful.Fueling all this is a spectacular cast. Ironically playing father and son, Martin Sheen and Charlie Sheen do superbly. Between the two is a question of loyalty, or riches. Daryl Hannah is quite good, and John C. McGinley fitted in nicely. All of these, however, are completely over shadowed by the incredible performance (in my opinion) of Michael Douglass. An image of power, money and forsaken morality, the character is downright exhilarating. The beauty of the film is that I myself am not really acquainted with Wall Street and business terminology. The nature of stocks rising and falling isn't my cup of tea, but the acting is so well done one hardly needs to, unlike in the recent sequel, where Shia receives a million dollar bonus and has a stoic reaction, to my distaste.",Wall Street

88,khatcher-2,The immorality of Wall Street traders,7,25 September 2003,"Oliver Stone has always given us films that have their moral and humane side, sociological aspects, and nowhere better perhaps than in this film. Stock market traders, sometimes called `yuppies', will try to make money at whatever expense. These people are ruthless in investing money to make more money. They see little numbers going up and down, and buy and sell accordingly. They have no interest in whether the company in question is profiteering from infant prostitution, drug trafficking, or distributing peanuts: they trade on whether values are going up or coming down. Who gets laid off or who gets richer is of no consequence, as long as they themselves get richer. This is, of course, immoral, but is known as savage consumerism, now aggravated by savage globalism.Surprisingly, Stone's film is as up-to-date today as when it was made sixteen years ago. Both father and son, Martin and Charlie Sheen, as well as Michael Douglas, turn in very applaudible performances, which turns the basic concept of the story into a very interesting film. The film helps us to understand the `dog-eat-dog' mentality of share traders and brokers on the stock exchanges of the world; one ends up feeling rather sorry for those poor blighters chasing money so that their incomes reach six-figure numbers. They have sold their souls to the devil, and, supposedly, this is what makes the world go round. Poor world. I imagine one day the merry-go-round will stop dead in its tracks, and a good many of them will press pistols to their temples. You might like to read some of the more philosophical articles and interviews by George Soros. Everything should then become very clear. I hope Bill Gates will not complain too much. But meanwhile enjoy a well thought out film with good drama and interpretations. Around seven out of ten on my scale, which is not at all bad considering that usually I do not like Michael Douglas very much, especially in more recent films.",Wall Street
89,RossRivero99,One of the best movies of the 1980's,10,1 November 2014,"Oliver Stone's Wall Street is a very interesting, entertaining, and very well acted movie about a young stockbroker named Bud Fox(played by Charlie Sheen) who is trying to be the best stockbroker in New York while working for his banking firm during the daytime hours, and then ends up working for the greedy stockbroker named Gordon Gekko (played by Michael Douglas) who takes him in and goes by his philosophy which are the most famous words in the movie ""Greed is good"", and at first Bud thinks that he is doing what a stockbroker and doesn't believe that he is doing anything bad even if his father Carl (played by Martin Sheen) is telling him that Gekko is trying to manipulate him into doing these unlawful. Stone uses a great supporting cast for this movie (besides Martin Sheen) but it also consists of Daryl Hannahas Bud's girlfriend Darien, Hal Holbrook as Bud's former boss, and Terence Stamp as Larry Wildman who is a good friend of the Fox family.This movie is a true must see for people who like corporate business dramas, or for people who like movies in general. One of the best movies of 1987.",Wall Street
90,Antagonisten,Highly entertaining,7,2 February 2005,"This is a 1980's classic to say the least. And for me at least one of the movies that defined the financial era of that decade.Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) is an up and coming stock broker who dreams of getting that big account. He works at a firm, calling people and trying to get customers. Then suddenly it happens. He manages to catch the big fish that everyone wants to catch. Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) is a big-shot in the business and soon Bud Fox is treated to the wonders of big finance, but also to it's less flattering sides.I would not call this movie a masterpiece (like some people do). But it is certainly an entertaining ride. Michael Douglas does one of his best performances ever as the stone cold Gordon Gekko. Charlie Sheen also does one of his better parts as Bud Fox who tries to keep up. Terence Stamp on the other hand is quite silly as the benevolent stock broker who thinks about the little man... And here is also the biggest problem with the movie. The set-up is that you are supposed to think Gordon Gekko is a bastard. He buys companies, cuts them up, fires everyone and walks away with the money. But still, for me at least, Gordon Gekko was the hero while watching the movie. He was the immortal ""cool"" guy who got the job done, had the private jet and the fancy cars. So who should i idolize? Who do i want to BE? Not the snotty Englishman with his outdated views on morality that's for sure.Therefore, as a morality tale this movie fails quite miserably. But as a look into the greedy and fast-moving 1980's it's highly entertaining. And if that's what you're after this is highly recommended.",Wall Street
91,policy134,The only Oliver Stone movie to have a sequel,8,2 October 2010,"Every time Oliver Stone makes a movie, you ask yourself: ""What was it I just saw?"", the exception being Any Given Sunday. This comes as close to a film with a straightforward narrative, as any film by Stone can be. We all understand the message that Gordon Gekko is the bad guy, but really, you can't help but be attracted to this scumbag, because really, haven't we all wished to be him at one point or another? That may explain why Stone decided to make the sequel. He is the most fascinating character Stone ever created.Don't be fooled. Gordon Gekko, even though fictional, is as real as they come. If you look at the second depression as we are well into today, Gordon Gekkos are everywhere. There is a feeling that we live in a time where greed is the order of the day because whatever you get, can be taken away in the blink of an eye. Sorry for the social commentary.Other than that, the movie is also the most entertaining Stone has ever done. Michael Douglas is mesmerising and it is weird to think of either Richard Gere or Warren Beatty playing Gekko, as was the first two choices.As for Darryl Hannah, what is everybody's problem? I think she did well for a part that's so different from anything else she has done. Stone may have manhandled her a little to get the performance he wanted, but honestly, I don't think Sean Young could do better (she wanted the part badly according to Stone). The two Sheens work well together too, though Charlie seems a little off as a corporate tycoon. His scenes with Douglas are clearly Douglas'.When you look back at this movie, which came out in the late 80s, you are amazed at how current it actually is. Sure, the technology looks more than a little dated and I actually think I saw something that resembled a laptop, that must have weighed about 80 pounds. Still, the stock exchange scenes are dead on to how our lives are controlled today. All information can be yanked out from anywhere if you just try hard enough. Eerie.A bit of fun fact: Did you notice that besides Sean Young that there were 2 more actors who later appeared in the much different flick Ace Ventura, Pet Detective. How funny is that?",Wall Street
92,oOoBarracuda,Wall Street,9,18 December 2016,"Oliver Stone crafted one of the best film characters in recent memory through his 1987 film, Wall Street. Gordon Gekko the corporate maverick with the motto ""greed is good"", flawlessly played by Michael Douglas completely owns the film. Also starring Martin and Charlie Sheen, Wall Street captures the journey one man takes trying to climb his way to the top of the stock broking ladder. A brilliant character study delving into the motivations and intricacies of corporate America, Stone delivers his typically scathing view of wealth and politics audiences have come to expect.Gordon Gekko is the king of the stockbrokers in New York during the 1980's. He's ruthless and has the take no prisoners attitude that it takes to get to the top of the heap. He's rich, powerful, and the envy of everyone in his field. Gordon is the hero to up and coming stockbroker, Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen). Bud is the product of a modest family upbringing born to airline union representative, Carl (Martin Sheen). After 59 consecutive days of calling Gordon's office hoping for a chance to work for him, Gordon feels charitable on his Birthday, when he accepts Bud's visit and gift. As it turns out, Bud was the one given a gift, as Gordon has finally decided to give him a chance to make a couple investments with his money. Once Bud sees how fast money can be earned as long as the initial investment is more money than he's ever seen in his life. Bud quickly becomes obsessed with the chase and increasingly devoted to seeking money until he completely submits himself to Gordon's notion that ""greed, for lack of a better word, is good."" The pace and questionable moral compass Gordon operates with eventually takes its toll on Bud in a way that may even end his career.Wall Street is Oliver Stone's manifesto on the consequences of greed and the life-altering effects the chase for capital reaps upon the individual. There is no room left to wonder what Stone thinks of the financial sector or those that work within it. Wall Street is a brilliant character study well-executed due to the brilliant acting on the parts of all involved. The only area where Wall Street suffers is the fact that it doesn't age well, although this is the struggle of any film with a heavy emphasis on technology. The constant shots of computers, phones, and ticker tape in 1987 have the glaring look of being outdated in 2016. The wonderful script, outstanding acting, and fantastic directing make Wall Street a fine film, even despite its dated look. The message of Wall Street persists and, is perhaps, even more necessary in today's political climate.",Wall Street

That is what this is all about, making money and thereby making a name for yourself. In such a competitive world, wouldn't all try to cheat just a little if they had the knowledge to it...This is a good film, has a lot of content I can't understand, but the basics is alright, if Greed is Good, well if you don't get caught up in it or caught by doing something illegal to achieve it, yes then it might be worth it.",Wall Street

I own a few shares, but don't really understand the whole thing.The film stars Charlie Sheen, Michael Douglas, Daryl Hannah & Martin Sheen. The acting was great. These actors are all very good and have an amazing career so far. I am a fan of Charlie Sheen... he has had a few personal problems, but I just wish people would just realise that his movie and TV career are the only thing we should criticise. We should leave his personal life alone. Michael Douglas is another actor that I used to dislike, but he has grown on me a lot. He is a very good actor and I am glad he has got over his cancer. I look forward to seeing more movies int he future. Daryl Hannah is the only person in this cast list that I think is average. She has been good in a few films and not so good in a few.The film just ran along and a steady pace. Not a lot really happened, but it was watchable. Charlie Sheen played a guy who would do almost anything to get where he wants to go in his career... and that means breaking the law for a multi millionaire who can give him what he wants. It all works well until the day this guy wants to liquidate his fathers job.What I loved about this film is the 80s. The clothes, hair and technology was funny. The phones were huge, the hair was huge but the shoulder pads were bigger. haha What a great decade... I loved it.It is a good film... and I did understand what was going on, but I just wish I understood it more. I will be watching Money Never Sleeps in the next couple of days... I am pretty sure that I will understand that as little as this one... but I am still looking forward to it.There were some good bits in the movie and it is a good film to show that greed can be dangerous.I will give this film 6 out of 10.An average film with a great cast list.For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl#",Wall Street
96,Idocamstuf,Entertaining movie about a greedy and heartless bastard,7,20 February 2005,"Dear lord, I have never seen so many greedy and heartless people in my entire life!! This movie is about a young and impatient stock broker who feels the need to get to the top. He spends his time idolizing and trying to get in touch with billionaire Wall Street tycoon, Gordon Gecko(Douglas in a good, but heartless Oscar winning performance.) He finally gets in touch with him and soon begins working for him, giving him inside tips about his father's(Martin Sheen, as an aircraft mechanic) company and helping him buy up other company stocks. But things soon start to get ugly when Gecko begins to have sinister plans for his father's company that will put even more money in his pockets.An entertaining story, but an absence of any likable characters, except for the two Sheen's as father and son leaves you with a sour taste in your mouth. Hearing Gordon Gecko say that ""greed is good"" and that its your own fault if you are not rich was enough to make me hate his character. This movie truly shows how capitalism can get way out of hand, and how some people just do not care about anything except for being the richest person in the country. Some people just have way too much and many times its just luck.I would recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys a good business film, but don't be surprised if you find yourself hating many of the characters in this greedy film. ***1/2 out of *****.",Wall Street
97,AvidClimber,Wall Street — How to make money by screwing with the financial system,7,18 February 2013,"Wall Street, by director Oliver Stone, was quite a movie in its heyday, and understandably so. It has some good acting, nice suspense, intrigue, drama, a strong theme, a well built script, and interesting visuals.However, it has some flaws. First, Daryl Hannah is definitively the worst actress of the cast, and can't even pull off a believable beautiful blond social climber. The decoration style of her character is mediocre at best, ugly probably being closer to the mark, even by the mid-80s standards. I'd like to think that Stone deliberately made her bad at decorating, but I think he simply was off the mark in terms of what good result is. There's also the fact that when we meet Gecko for the first time, he's over done (a common thing in Hollywood when introducing some characters). The Sheen family crying time seems unreal, probably due to bad editing, bad coverage, or bad script, because they do the rest to perfection. Finally, the undercover wire recording is unrealistic, the way Gecko just goes with it and the final sound quality.Now, it's still an interesting movie, and it has aged relatively well considering. The story is still captivating and entertaining. The main male actors, Charlie Sheen, his father Martin Sheen, and Michael Douglas, all have solid performance, if not Oscar worthy.It's a classic, and warrant to be watched before seeing the second installment.",Wall Street
98,rooee,It's all about bucks; the rest is conversation,8,25 November 2011,"""America has become a second-rate power. Its trade deficit and its fiscal deficit are at nightmare proportions."" No, that's not Robert Peston speaking on the Today Programme this morning – it's Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) nearly 25 years ago, from the speech that gave the world the chilling mantra, ""Greed is good"". There are tons of great quotes in Oliver Stone's classic corporate horror story. ""What's worth doing is worth doing for money,"" claims Gekko, perpetuating the myth that the drive for profit and morality are somehow compatible. ""How much is enough?"" asks young buck Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen), encapsulating the problem with rampant consumerism: it's a goddamn eating machine. The natives that people New York's corporate jungle seem to speak in an entirely foreign language, wielding initialisms like poisoned spears: ""don't know"" becomes ""D.K."", as if another soul isn't worth the breath of the softer syllables. No wonder Patrick Bateman went loopy. Meanwhile an undercurrent of Nietzschean moral defeatism colours the dastards' verbal transactions, with Gekko claiming that ""Greed has marked the upward surge of mankind"" – albeit countered later when the avuncular Lou (Hal Holbrook) takes the nihilist philosopher's famous ""abyss"" quote and reverses its meaning. Unlike Stone's Scarface, Wall Street offers at least a glimmer of hope. Stone effectively captures the bankers' joy and shell-shock through unfussy direction and stark fluorescent lighting, wisely displaying none of the cool corporate sheen employed by next-gen directors like Christopher Nolan and David Fincher.Where the film stumbles is in a couple of key performances. While Michael Douglas deserved his Oscar, and John C. McGinley (as Marvin) and Martin Sheen (as Bud's father) provide excellent support, Charlie Sheen fails to find much range throughout his rise and fall, while Darryl Hannah, as the beach-haired object of Bud's affections, is a vessel as empty as one of Gekko's platitudes. Together they are wholly unconvincing, although this may be down to the cringe-worthy recourse to hackneyed melodrama that charts their relationship. But these scenes don't spoil an otherwise flawless script that Aaron Sorkin would be proud to print out. This is one of those ""people talking in rooms"" films that Mark Kermode sometimes refers to, and it's a pleasure to listen (and grimace) as they talk, even as we come to the depressing conclusion that while the phones might have gotten smaller, and the salaries bigger, 1987 looks an awful lot like 2011.",Wall Street

His speech that unapologetically states that ""greed is good"" became as much as a business mantra as it did a quotable movie moment.

Bud has been trying to get a meeting with Gordon for a while, and eventually gets 5min with him to show his skills. When Gordon shows his lack of interest, Bud divulges some info on a company whom his father works for that is essentially insider trading. Gordon loves insider trading, so tells Bud if he wants his business he needs to keep the inside info coming on other companies too. Bud decides to essentially sell his soul and do this so that he can get all Gordon offers. When a deal goes bad, Bud must decide if he'll keep towing the line or make a stand. Will Bud sell out? See it to find out.OK, but not as good as I thought. I thought the Gecko character was going to be way bigger and that Bud was slimier, but it didn't pan out this way.

101,eagandersongil,"Power, money, greed and cliché.",7,18 March 2017,"""Wall street power and greed"" is a film about the money and the degradation it brings, with an always pessimistic view of money, Oliver Stone tries to show us the capacity of corruption of the human being in exchange for his materialism , Except that Stone is extremely clichéd and caricature in his message. With a well-worked script that subtly shows the change of the secondary characters due to the enrichment of our protagonist, and leaves loose points in its plot by ignoring the illicit enrichment without showing how the money was washed or something of the kind, anyway The story of Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen), an ambitious stockbroker in the 1980s who engages in a scheme of speculation and illegal information gathering for self-enrichment and his cupbearer Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas). The moral of the film is precisely to talk about the degradation and well of materialism, and Oliver Stone who is known for making documentaries of socialist character and for always his severe criticisms of capitalism, his film can be caricato and loaded with ideology, Stone is a great director and managed to get his message across, albeit weak. Technically, film is good, has a spectacular montage and a great mix of sound, a color palette with grayer tones, typical of the 80s and a soundtrack full of Jazz that composes well the scenes. In terms of performances we have no highlights , All fulfill their function and finished, we do not have three-dimensional performances, exaggerated and not very contained, but worth a compliment to Martin Sheen who is great as a supporting.

102,Eternality,Stone makes his statement and delivers the message with aplomb but his speech falls short of being spectacular.,7,27 September 2010,"""Greed is good,"" says Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) in one of the most famous quotes from '80s cinema. Gekko is as rich as anyone can get from shrewd investment although his methods may be sometimes illegal or unethical. ""But everyone does it,"" he claims nonchalantly. On the other side of the coin is Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen), a stockbroker who dreams of living the high life with lots of cash flow. In the film, Fox charms his way into the tutelage of Gekko, learning the trade and getting lessons on how to make obscene amounts of money.But in the picture's most important scene, Fox confronts Gekko over his greed. ""How much is enough?"" The latter does not know. Does anyone? Wall Street is Oliver Stone's critique of a world in which money is everything; everything else is secondary. Our world seems uncannily similar. There must be something fundamentally wrong with our financial system when it values high-risk greed over low-yield ethics. It is hard to see such a system sustain itself and now with insurmountable debts and a collapsing economy, we must pay the price for our greed.In a way, Stone's film is visionary. Wall Street dissects the sins that make us slaves to the dollar sign. Greed. Pride. Lust. Envy. But he also observes that when our conscience is clear and we do what is morally right, greed can be controlled. The film is photographed with an intensity that captures the madness and the fast-paced pursuit of easy money fueled by an environment where a phone call can mean millions gain or lost.Stone's screenplay (written together with Stanley Weiser) is coherent and detailed but it fails to engage as it should. For the layman, watching Wall Street can be as tepid and boring as, well, reading a Wall Street journal. Stone's assumes that most of us know stock market jargon and how the whole system works, but half the time we are actually scratching our heads. To Stone's credit, he does make the dialogue appear momentarily exciting but after a while, it becomes an indefinable chorus of frenzied garble.The glue that makes Wall Street at the very least watchable is its characters. Douglas' Oscar-winning performance is not great but it is convincing enough to arrest our attention. Sheen does not match Douglas' ferocious display of Gekko's power and authority, but he does an adequate job portraying Fox whose character changes drastically in the film. The most understated performance goes to Martin Sheen who depicts Fox's father as resolute and moral, someone who never gives in to materialism.Wall Street is an important film but it is not very entertaining. Even when the actors light up the screen, there is a feeling that underneath the whole façade of seemingly excellent filmmaking lurks a mechanical sense of dullness. This is not Stone at his worst; neither does it rank as one of his best. Yet Wall Street is more relevant today than it was in the late '80s. It is a reminder to the Gekkos out there that greed destroys lives. Stone makes his statement and delivers the message with aplomb but his speech falls short of being spectacular.SCORE: 7/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",Wall Street

This movie was right on for the most part. Yes there were a couple of holes in this movie, but the overall message the film wanted to portray was there. People go into the stock market as traders to make tons of money . If compared to baseball, few rise to the majors but most flounder in the minors. Bud Fox was a decent young whipper snapper that got an education on the back of his blue collar father , a foreman in the airline industry. Bud Fox was seduced by the high life...Money and gorgeous women, enter Daryl Hannah. Gordon Gecco was Mr. Fox steroids to make it in the majors and he had tunnel vision , never looking back with possible dire circumstances to answer. Michael Douglas deserved his Oscar and everyone else did a fine job too. John McGinley , for a small part was excellent. DO not want to forget the bit players in this film. I also liked the way they contrasted what success means.. Financial -enter Bud Fox vs. family values- enter Carl Fox. Brilliantly played by father-son tandem Martin Sheen and Charlie Sheen , respectfully. When watching this movie notice the time warp. It was 1987 , not too far removed and multi millionaires are running for pay phones on Manhattan street corners. I thought that was interesting.

Oddly enough, you can also empathize with Gordon Gekko, and even find his talk about greed makes some sense. The trouble is, even that is a smoke screen for what he is really doing, when you face reality, as Bud eventually does. But it is Oliver Stone's credit that he doesn't over simplify too much, or over-demonize.

The ones I've seen are manipulators who put on a face and tell you one thing while planning to do the opposite, who are cold at heart, and seem to create only the illusion of emotion. In other words, they are sociopaths. In that sense, the Gekko character is actually almost too human. I decided to finally watch Wall Street after reading Paul Krugman's repeated references to the film in his New York Times columns. I'm not a fan of Oliver Stone, and thought he went too far into the realm of conspiratorial imagination in Nixon. Here, he is portraying a real type of conspiracy that is probably going on all the time. The trouble is it is conducted too obviously; there is not enough subtlety and deception involved. But that's OK. It's a two hour movie -- not a John le Carré novel -- and you get the idea. And besides (spoiler alert) I don't think I am revealing anything the viewer doesn't anticipate from the beginning, it's got to be clumsy enough for them to get caught. It's not every day you see a film that is as true today as the day it was made, yet with Wall Street it is more so. The criminal securities insanity that led up to the 2008 crash was the result of people with far less integrity than even Gordon Gekko. Gekko only destroyed firms he bought, while these people almost destroyed the entire world economy, and seriously crippled the American economy, with all the callous greed of a crooked card game. Oliver Stone may have simplified the details in the name of artistic license, but in Wall Street he produced a masterpiece that provides a portrait of what is wrong with our era. When people in the future puzzle over how things could go so wrong, they should watch Wall Street. I am tempted to suggest that Stone balance this with a film about what is right, about, say, NGOs or non-profits. But I'm afraid you could do a movie about some of these and show a greed that is even more incomprehensible, a greed only Charles Dickens understood and could still make entertaining.The greed is good ethos seems to be pervading so much of American life that many people, like Gekko, don't even feel a need to apologize, even while they are stealing the bread out of others' mouths. The problem isn't simply greed, it is dishonest, cheating greed. Why everyday people hold people of this sort who are rich in high regard is a mystery to me. Yet people like Bud Fox aspire to be like them. There was a fellow who was a wholesale bootlegger, stock swindler and gentleman with ties to the Mafia, yet he was made U.S. ambassador to Britain, and was treated with such great respect that his son was elected President. Go figure. It takes more than SEC investigations to stop this sort of thing, it takes a change in values. Aside from all that, Wall Street is an enjoyable movie to watch.",Wall Street
107,galileo3,"Stone's superb picture on the greed, power and testosterone driven financial markets is as relevant as ever. Outstanding...",9,1 September 2006,"Wall Street (1987)Number 1 - 1987 Top 10 - 1980s Top 100 - All Time Wall Street is a great film. A spectrum of human greed and ruthlessness. Oliver Stone takes on the stock exchange in this powerful look at how eagerness and ambition turned the life of a young stock broker upside down.Wall Street is a fine film. Possibly Oliver Stone's best. What makes this film a good film, is that it is realistic and uncompromising. Stone provides a thrilling story driven by a greedy Michael Douglas and a naive Martin Sheen (in their roles). Possibly the best film of 1987. Wall Street is extremely relevant in the current climate. The global economy is plunging into bitter and unchartered depths due to the greed of big finance, big governments and fat cats. There is a superb snapshot of dialogue spoken by Michael Douglas in the film that sums up what this film is really about:""The richest one percent of this country owns half our country's wealth, five trillion dollars. One third of that comes from hard work, two thirds comes from inheritance, interest on interest accumulating to widows and idiot sons and what I do, stock and real estate speculation. It's bullshit. You got ninety percent of the American public out there with little or no net worth. I create nothing. I own. We make the rules, pal. The news, war, peace, famine, upheaval, the price per paper clip. We pick that rabbit out of the hat while everybody sits out there wondering how the hell we did it. Now you're not naive enough to think we're living in a democracy, are you buddy? It's the free market. And you're a part of it. You've got that killer instinct. Stick around pal, I've still got a lot to teach you."" That is what Wall Street is all about.

108,antagonist117,Wall Street is too unsubtle to be an effective critique,3,1 April 2015,"Martin Sheen plays a blue-collar worker. You know he's a blue-collar worker because he always wears an unbuttoned blue shirt stained with mechanic's grease, and he hangs out in a classic dive bar in Queens with his burly, beer-drinking buddies. He wishes that his son, played by Charlie Sheen, would have become this or that instead of a stockbroker. Can you guess which two professions he envisions for his son? If you guessed lawyer and doctor, congratulations, you've seen a movie and you know the clichés. And if you've paid attention, you know why that cliché is all wrong for Martin Sheen's character. He is created in the classic image of the hard-working, straight- shooting, lunch-pail-carrying union man, so what use does he have for a lawyer son any more or less than a stockbroker son? All a doctor son would do is tell him to put out the cigarettes he smokes as a kind of socio-political statement. If it's just upward mobility he's after for his son (it's not, as he makes clear), then high- powered trader ought to be good enough. His ""lawyer or doctor"" speech is not just a hack line of dialogue, it's the wrong hack dialogue in the wrong hack character's mouth.Between that early scene and the end, ""Wall Street"" and the people in it change very little. The mode of expression is obvious and labored and faux-intellectual for the duration. The movie is Oliver Stone's spoonful of supposed truth about the rotten core of American capitalism, force-fed to audiences without any adulteration of wit or charm. A lot of critics and audiences lapped it up in 1987. They and the Oscar voters were Father Stone's choir, happy to give a pass to his pulpit-pounding so long as he was sticking it to the Reaganites and Thatcherites. Michael Douglas's Gordon Gecko and his British counterpart played by Terrence Stamp are the strawmen who stand in for the latter groups. Conveniently, they know they are bad guys. They don't have the pesky tendency of real-world people to believe that they're basically decent. When Gecko says ""Greed is good,"" one of many soundbytes the script tries on and one of few that fits, he is trying to persuade a roomfull of stockholders that capitalism is the engine of progress and a force for good in the world. If he believed that, as many people do, he'd have been a much more interesting figure. The characters played by the Sheens would have to engage him more thoughtfully in order to make a case to the contrary. Happily for them, no such effort is required by them, Stone, or the audience, because Gecko doesn't really believe what he says; he knows he's hurting others, and he doesn't care. The lifestyle he has, the language he uses, and the amorality he cultivates all exist in real life, and maybe sociopaths like him do exist in greater proportions on Wall Street than on Main Street. But characters as black and white as Douglas and Martin Sheen's are the exception. ""Wall Street"" is a fantasy movie, the world as Stone's conspiratorial mind imagines it to be. It is neither politically nor emotionally intelligent.It is, however, cheesy, and this goes a long way toward making the film watchable. Charlie Sheen's Bud breaking down by a hospital bed is as old a chestnut as the scene where his meat-and-potatoes father looks askance at a hoity-toity piece of sushi and the one where Gecko quotes Sun-tzu. These moments are so earnest and yet so cartoonish that they create some unintentional levity by virtue of their familiarity.There is some good stagecraft and visual communication in ""Wall Street."" Many shots are stuffed front to back with people, and this brings the always-inhuman spectacle of the trading floor into the usually quieter spaces of white-collar offices and the executive conference rooms. All levels of the Wall Street world are thus implicated in the madness. At the back and along the edges of many of these crowded rooms, Stone carefully places ""real"" workers doing hands-on jobs: window-washers, janitors, many of them minorities and women. This is as subtle as the film gets, and it is more effective in its quiet way than Gecko's villainy or Martin Sheen's self- righteousness.",Wall Street
109,Alex-372,Excellent,10,2 September 2002,"Wall Street is one of those great films that not only work as a story, but in the process highlight a segment of society and history that is very hard to get a grip on and at the same is the emblem of an era.
Wall Street deals with the Wall Street raider, investment banker and hustler Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) and his aspiring acolyte, Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen). The characters are very loosely based on real-life Wall Street raider Ivan Boesky and his young gofer, Dennis Levine. ""If you want a friend, get a dog"" is straight out Michael Lewis's Liar's Poker (""If you want loyalty, buy a cocker spaniel."").The movie is not only a beautiful marking of an era, it is also highly prophetic. Produced in 1986/87 (Bud's computer shows 1985), it impossible not to see in Bud's demise, the demise of the stockmarket in October 1987, the biggest crash since 1929, the year that ushered in the Great Depression.
Also prophetic is Gordon's ranting about technology (consumer technology) being  the wave of the future - we haven't even recovered from the internet/pc boom yet, that followed in the mid to late nineties. By today's standards, the wireless phone Gordon is using on the beach looks the size of a car battery. Which is a nice to see too.

110,son_of_cheese_messiah,The best and worst of Stone,8,4 April 2011,"For most of the length of this film, Stone crafts an utterly gripping tale with vivid and believable characters and memorable scenes and dialogue. Almost despite ourselves, we feel drawn towards the selfish and ruthless Gekko (well played by Douglas) as much as Buddy is. Gekko represents the worst of capitalism and it is a tribute to all concerned that he comes across, if not sympathetic, then completely convincing in his own terms. The relationships which Buddy has with other characters such as the touching one with his real life father Martin Sheen and his girlfriend Darryl Hannah are also well characterised although less developed. Stone is keen to show a rather idealised version of trades unionism in the form of the hardworking and incorruptible Martin Sheen, to juxtapose against the almost demonic Gekko. Although Stone's ideological bias is well known, for the most part few would disagree that honest day's work is better than living off the toil of others.However in the denouement Stone's politics interfere with the story. He suddenly has Gekko saying things like ""one per cent of Americans own 90 per cent of the wealth"", ""It's a zero sum game"" and ""I do not produce anything"", leftwing talking points which sound unconvincing coming from the mouth of Gekko. In fact this need to hammer out the point actually detracts from a message which the audience would have gotten anyway.The curious meeting between Gekko and Buddy seems to come out of the blue too. It does not seem consistent with Gekko's character that he would be drawn out into such a situation in the first place, let alone fly into a rage which we have not witnessed before and then make a series of incriminating statements. This is someone that Gekko has set-up, so why would he then agree to meet him and in such an isolated place? For all he knew, Bud may have come armed and certainly had the motive for revenge. But not that nor the possibility of a wire tap occurred to the otherwise wily Gekko. It is a pity that this falls at the final hurdle since it really does deserve its iconic status with much fine writing and some great performances.",Wall Street

And he does so by joining forces with the most ruthless of investors: Michael Douglas. A man whose only pleasure comes from making money without any regards for anything or anyone. The predictable twist comes when the two characters are about to close a multi billion airline deal. It they go ahead with their plan, great wealth awaits both of them, but the young broker's father and thousands of other co-workers lose their jobs in the process. The young broker faces the ultimate dilemma: to become what he had always wished for or to save his father by relinquishing his dreams.

114,arthurclay,The film that defined a generation,10,10 December 2007,"It was the 80's. It was my generation. Well, close enough. Most motion pictures cannot boast this. And very few leave such a lasting impression twenty years later. Michael Douglas made this film. It was his greatest achievement. Fatal Attraction made him the most money, but Wall Street gave him the status as a leading actor that he enjoyed afterwards. Gordon Gekko represents everything a man secretly wants to be. Rich, successful, handsome, powerful, and admired. The foundation behind his persona is built on deception, lies, backstabbing, manipulation, and naturally, greed. Insatible, all consuming, greed. What this film is really showing you, at its most purest form, is a deal with the Devil. Bud Fox is Faust, and Gordon Gekko is the Devil. Not literally, but figuratively. The deal is made right there in Gekko's limo. Give me your full commitment(his soul), and I will give you fantastic wealth beyond your wildest dreams. Fox's flaw is that he believes he can be an equal partner with Gekko. He jumps at this one chance after he has thought about the serious consequences and still does it. But you cannot be ""partners"" with the ""Devil"". It just doesn't work that way and never will. Gekko's flaw is that he believes he can screw everyone in sight and get away with it. They are both ultimately wrong. This film was made as a cautionary tale concerning the excesses of the Eighties. Absolute power corrupts absolutely. And greed will be our downfall. Oliver Stone was right on both counts. Americans know this but still haven't really learned it. Greed is not good.",Wall Street

It's not bad by all means, but a lot of the movie's elements seem dated in the new millennium. Young Charlie Sheen is passable, although his performance reaches a low point, when somewhere in the middle of the movie he says to himself 'who am I?' with terrible shallowness. Of course, you could get away with such a script in the 80's, but today it's at least embarrassing. Oh, and Daryl Hannah's character wants 'world peace' too!But you also have Michael Douglas, who gives an unforgettable performance as the powerful Gordon Gekko. Douglas is totally convincing and he really stands out in the movie. The reason that everyone still remembers 'Wall Street' is Michael Douglas, who was supported by the always excellent Martin Sheen and Terence Stamp.Let's not forget that 'Wall Street' is an Oliver Stone movie, so it essentially carries a 'message'.

118,C22Man,A Story of Greed and Morality,7,20 June 2016,"Oliver Stone has always been a director willing to tackle social and political subjects within his films. Whether it's the evils of war, corporate evil, political conspiracy or the influence of mass media, he takes on all of these subjects with intelligence. His first film after the success of 'Platoon' was to look into the shadiness and corruption within stockbroking. It is the story of rookie stockbroker Bud Fox who comes under the wing of Gordon Gekko, an affluent corporate raider whose determination is unparalleled. From this premise the film builds as Bud becomes more involved in Gekko's suspicious business plans whilst getting to experience both the highs and the lows of such dealings.What is most impressive (and positive from an entertainment aspect) is how you don't have to know much about trading or the stock market to enjoy the film. I myself know very little on the matter, yet the film manages to make some rather complicated issues understandable and the dialogue is very snappy throughout which makes it easy to swallow. The dialogue manages to do something very notable, which is make almost everything said sound equally naturalistic and quotable. What the characters say carries enough authenticity to make it sound like something they would actually say, whilst retaining a flair that allows it to be memorable. Gekko's famous ''Greed is good'' speech is a perfect example of this. Bud's conversations with his father and witty interactions with his workmate Marvin provide a nice contrast to the corporate elements. Michael Douglas won the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Gekko and it's easy to see why. The character has become synonymous with the business world and the corruption of the stock market. Douglas himself strikes the perfect balance between hammy and intense. The character is very slimy and cunning but he's also magnetic and interesting, and Douglas captures all of these sides without diluting the part. Charlie Sheen also deserves some praise for his solid performance as Bud. It's not an easy role to play given he isn't as brash as Gekko and has play around the characters naivety, yet Sheen leads the film fine and his rigid acting style fitting the role surprisingly well. I think Sheen could have had an interesting career had he stuck with more serious roles.The film is quintessentially 80's and I mean that in the nicest possible way. The fashion, the technology, the cars, the décor, it's all stylised to large degree. The surprising thing is that the film doesn't suffer from feeling dated. I think that this story is so strongly linked to the time period that it manages to suit the stylisation perfectly. Adding to this is Stone's exceptional direction and some very slick editing. Stone's films always have a fluidity and energy to them, which can make even the slowest moments engaging. He also has a good gage how long a scene should go on for and when it is time to move on, none of the scenes here outstay their welcome. The editing also stands out, as with many of Stone's later films everything moves along at a swift pace without coming at the price of any story or character development.I think all the characters are well developed and have clear motivations. The supporting roles are especially important. The always interesting James Spader, Stone's regular John C. McGinley and the great Terence Stamp are all excellent actors and add credibility to their small roles. Martin Sheen as Bud's honest working-class father playing off against his real life son creates an interesting contrast and actually gives the relationship added realism. The only blemish is the wooden Daryl Hannah whose vacant performance is lost here as Bud's girlfriend. Elsewhere, Stewart Copeland provides a very complimentary score. Filled with a lot of ambiance and clattering yet subtle rhythms, it gives the film an edge and works well with many of the visuals.Wall Street is a very memorable film and one that always come to mind when you thing of either the stock market or excess within film. It has retained its power after all these years. I think this is in large part down to the success of its director and cast. Stone proved that once and for all that he was a director of great understanding with this film, whilst the performance of Michael Douglas has pretty much become synonymous with 80's greed and corruption. It isn't a completely flawless film, but it is one that understands its own story and importantly the message it's trying to get across. Throughout the film we ask, will Bud turn out like his greedy mentor or his honest father? It is this dilemma that keeps us gripped and guessing.",Wall Street

124,mattrochman,"Excellent film, but the ""twist"" is all wrong",7,19 April 2006,"This is an interesting film about the so-called decade of ""greed"". It opens strongly, which is shortly followed by Michael Douglas's powerful entrance and top-class, engaging portrayal of a ruthless corporate raider. Factually speaking, the Gekko representation of corporate raiders is overdone. He's portrayed as a highly charismatic, money-obsessed, slimy and narcissistic wall street guru. Almost like a mix of JFK and a used car salesman. Unfortunately, the sad truth is that most people who are in Gekko's position in the real world are extremely boring and dull. They don't deliver grandstanding capitalist ideology all day - they're too busy making money to justify what they're doing!!! That said, in many ways, I felt that the power of Douglas's portrayal contrasted too strongly with Sheen's meek portrayal of Bud Fox. There was a certain naturalism that Sheen brought to the role, but he just wasn't in the same league as Douglas's portrayal of Gekko. This divides the audience's loyalties too far - enchantered with Gekko to such a degree that we are almost distracted from identifying with Bud. And while we're on the subject of acting, I'd like to add that Darryl Hannah's acting in this film was disgraceful. Don't even get me started.Another major pitfall was the last 30 minutes of this film. There was something so overstated about it. There were so many ways to begin to show the human side of Gekko and other raiders' quest for profit, but this was a bit too much ""he'd sell his own children for a quarter percent."" Furthermore, I felt that Gekko's verbal tirades started to become highly obscure and inconsistent with his verbal tirades earlier in the film. He becomes extremely ideological which i some how found too misplaced or perhaps too unrealistic. I think Stone was just itching to squeeze it in somewhere, but it was very overlooked and very far fetched. He'd secretly sell out the airline that his protégé wanted to turn around and whose father is an employee... and then justifies it ideologically when ""caught""? Get real! A very unrealistic left-wing image of a wall street millionaire.Further, I found Stone's resolution to the final build up was almost comical. After Bud realises the errors in his ways, he turns to another rutherless corporate raider who is probably just as bad, if not worse, than Gekko. Conveniently, the SEC wait until Bud saves the day before coming to arrest him. Conveniently, he goes to jail despite ratting out Gekko because those who get greedy will always get their own. But let's work in a little bit of justice: Bud was was able to bring down Gekko in process when he met in Central park and Gekko conveniently gave a confession of sorts that Bud caught on tape. So at least the personification of evil capitalist swine will get what's coming to him....But let's be realistic: 1) The corporate raider who bought bluestar will probably honour the contract not to break it up and sell it off for about 2 or 3 years... then exploit a loophole and then sell it off, retrench the staff and pocket the overfunded pension fund. 2) Bud would have gone to jail as shown in the film. 3) Gekko would have walked away from it scott free. His $10,000 a minute lawyers would have evidence against him thrown out and have documented evidence that he acts without Gekko's knowledge or authority, and any charges whittled down to a slap on the wrist. OTherwise, a good one to revisit.",Wall Street
125,Mr. OpEd,Funny to see liberals foul up history (and other people's money).,1,18 April 1999,"Wall Street helped me save time and money! I knew then and there that if this was Oliver Stone's concept of reality, I didn't need to watch his stuff again. OK, so some people enjoyed Wall Street as a comedy. And there were a couple of -- OK -- one highlight: Douglas is terrific (just as terrific as the other actors are embarrassing, especially Martin Sheen at his hammiest). Stone wants us to hate the 80s as much as he does and hammers ""the decade of greed"" into most every scene, ""Greed is good"". Who knows, maybe Stone can re-make history (JFK, Nixon), but I think reality will out. For example, how great is Wall Street when you understand that the economy we're enjoying today began in the 80s, that corporate America actually paid MORE in taxes in the 80s, and that charitable giving was at all time high (at least since FDR took over the charity business in the 30s)?

Buying and selling, buying and selling, insider trading, home renovating.It really is richly detailed, and the acting is, too. Michael Douglas, obviously, in what is probably his most praised role, does a fantastic job. If an actor can play a character that you know is doing wrong, but is able to entrance you in his little speeches, justifying himself so perfectly that you almost start to agree with him, you know he's done a great job. It's so obvious that Michael Douglas is a talented and committed actor- a great actor- that it really makes me sad that you could probably count his best performances on your right hand.On the whole, I really liked Wall Street, but my only complaint about it is that it is very aesthetically unpleasing. It must have been shot using a lot of natural light. Many of the scenes are dark and muddled, there are so many scenes taking place at dawn or dusk, and it is very distracting to the story. Sometimes you can barely tell what's happening on the screen. It's certainly not a visual film. It's primarily focused on the plot and the performances.When you get right down to it, Wall Street is a film with a message that's hard to argue with. The main character, Bud Fox, does gain back his soul, but his bad deeds do not go unpunished. The movie ends with the likely possibility that he will be going to jail for his insider trading. ""In some twisted way, it's the best thing that could ever happen to you"" says his wise and down-to-earth father, ""Maybe now you'll learn to create rather than profit off the buying and selling of others."" My rating: 8/10",Wall Street
127,MovieLuvaMatt,"Taut, sharply written thriller",7,10 July 2003,"I mainly purchased the DVD, because of two reasons:  Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen.  I'm quite an admirer of both actors.  I have virtually no knowledge about the stock market, or about stocks themselves.  Those who are in the market or have vast knowledge about stocks will probably enjoy the film much more.  However, I still enjoyed the film.  When a movie's really good, it doesn't matter whether or not the audience member is interested in the topic.  Besides, the film boils down to basic universal themes, like selling your soul to the devil and money being the root of all evil.   
The characters are interesting and richly developed, with the exception of Darryl Hannah's underwritten character.  I can see why she didn't like playing that role.  Douglas is always a joy to watch, and makes a suave yet slimy villain.  I wouldn't necessarily say he deserved an Oscar, but he did a fine job nonetheless.  So did Charlie Sheen, who is actually the star of the film despite the fact that most people remember ""Wall Street"" for Douglas as Gordon Gecko.  Sheen gives a fine multi-dimensional performance. I love the scenes between him and his father Martin Sheen, who plays his father in the film.  Oliver Stone made a great choice casting the father-and-son team, since the tension in their scenes feels very authentic.There are some predictable plot turns and character arcs, but altogether Stone keeps the excitement going.  I like how the climactic scene between Douglas and Sheen is shot without cuts, with the camera moving from person to person, keeping the tension going.  If I knew at least an inkling about the stock market, I wouldn't be completely lost during certain scenes, but what can you do?  I still think it's a fine film with solid performances. 
My score:  7 (out of 10)",Wall Street
128,the-gossip-king,"Interesting, fast moving movie!",7,15 April 2008,"I would like to start by comparing this to the Devil Wears Prada. Both have sleazy bosses and both turned out to be good movies. If your looking for a recommendation on a movie about assholes for bosses then I think girls should go and see that and guys should see this. Thats not to say women might enjoy this but I think that since this is a male dominated film and Prada is the opposite it is better to take either road. Besides that the movie itself is fantastic. I don't know what it is but I love movies about big ego snobs. Michael Douglas was superb in this movie and deserved the Oscar indefinitely. It is a shame Charlie Sheen isn't doing many good movies recently because he is also very believable in this movie only I would have liked to see a bit more of a transformation into the sleazy guy that he becomes. I am not saying he pulled off becoming sleazy well, I just think he should have been a bit less sleazy in the beginning. Daryl Hannah wasn't very appealing like she was in Roxanne but she wasn't even on the screen for that long anyway. Overall, I recommend it, it is a classic.",Wall Street
129,ALauff,Would make a great double-bill with Platoon,8,15 February 2005,"Director Oliver Stone's reunion with actor Charlie Sheen less than a year after Platoon seems more purposeful than serendipitous: the Sheen character from Platoon born twenty years later, immersed in a more sanitized, but just as ruthless, killing ground than the quagmire of Vietnam. Whereas an unrelenting corporeal and psychological assault was Stone's thematic device in the former, the focus here is on the inescapable entrapment of grandeur. The plain awkwardness and nebulousness of morality in an isolated place accounts for the shattering of innocence—and, more specifically, an acutely deleterious effect on the conscience and its ability to guide characters to morally discerning choices—in both films.Stone's sense of off-screen space is wonderful, as in a scene where Bud's father objects to Gecko's projected ownership of a family-owned airline. Cutting from a two-shot confrontation between father and son, Stone closes in on Martin rumpled in the corner of an elevator car, carrying on a seemingly one-sided conversationuntil he whip-pans to Bud, offering a Manichean rebuttal. I would stop short of calling Wall Street a sequel; for instance, there aren't any profiteers in the early film (at least none that are knowable within its tight focus), whereas Michael Douglas manipulates human laborers like pieces on a chessboard, milking chattel for premium gain. In some way, many of Stone's films traffic in the manipulation of the masses by some spectral or abstract presence—it is this filmmaker's raison d'être, just one of his many resolute virtues that has somehow evaded esteem or even recognition.",Wall Street
130,Mr_PCM,A star turn from Michael Douglas,8,15 April 2009,"A fascinating flashpoint look at life in the stock market in the 1980s, complete with pinstripe shirts, braces and very dodgy dealings. Oliver Stone, he of the conspiracy-theorising and government-baiting, paranoia, again takes a look at what lies below a glossy surface – this time taking a searchlight and magnifying glass to the financial dealings of Wall Street – the centre of the world for capitalist trading; and again leaves us with a number of fascinating questions.Charlie Sheen plays the wide-eyed salesman Bud Fox, working hard for his big break and hoping to meet his idol – the big-money dealing Gordon Gekko – only to find that his 'hero' is not too discerning when it comes to where his earnings come from . So begins his tutelage into the real workings of Wall Street, and his apprenticeship to the capitalist Gekko. As his confidence grows, so does his wealth, but at the expense of his integrity. As Fox becomes more and more dazzled and corrupted by the mind-boggling money being traded around, the remaining question is simply when will it go wrong, and how badly? A simple question but one you will desperately want to know the answer to. When his eyes are finally opened to the reality of Wall Street, is it too late? Has he sold his soul to the devil? For those unfamiliar with the workings of the stock market, trading scenes will seem to be somewhat in a foreign language, and the constant cliché-spouting and quoting of Sun Tzu does rapidly date the film. However, the ever deepening layers of corruption ensure a riveting film. The cynicism and corruption of capitalism, which seems to be the underlying message of the film, is never summed up better than in Gekko's signature to his shareholders – 'Greed is Good'.Michael Douglas has a blast as the now-infamous Gordon Gekko in an Oscar-winning and scenery-chewing performance. He literally fills the screen whenever he is on so you cannot take your eyes off him. Think Alec Baldwin's performance in Glengarry Glen Ross filled out with even more charisma and BSing. Charlie Sheen meanwhile captures Bud Fox's descent perfectly – the innocence to confidence, becoming arrogance and finally the realisation. Martin Sheen playing his son's father somehow gives the film an added authenticity. Daryl Hannah however is not really given enough to do for an actress of her talents. But all this is made up for by Douglas' award-winning riveting performance - which is definitely worth an extra star on its own and raises the film to well above average.A film with thrills more rooted in accumulation rather than action, a bit of a slow-burner but with all the moral dilemmas we have come to expect from an Oliver Stone film. The intricacies of the workings of the Stock Market isn't the most obvious choice of material, and this does cause the film to lag occasionally in pace - the stock exchange is a poor substitute for the courtroom for thrilling drama. Yet he mostly makes it work. While not quite on the level of the conspiracy-baiting JFK, it does share with that film the propensity to make you stop and think – something which is all Mr Stone asks for.",Wall Street
131,garyvanhorn,A rare Oliver Stone film that is worth watching.,9,10 January 2011,"Rooting for the antagonist in a feature film usually means that the protagonist is a spineless, whiny, poorly acted mess of a character that you dislike so much that you want him to die and the movie to end quickly. Though I did find myself admiring Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglass) it wasn't because Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) was poorly done in any way. Rather it was because of the superb job both the film and Douglass did in bringing to life the wonderful character of Gordon Gekko.Bud Fox is a low level Wall Street broker that works the phones at an investment firm, trying to sell stocks to investors. Knowing that he won't get rich doing so, Fox also tirelessly pursues the big fish, like Gordon Gekko, trying to prove he is more than just another stock broker working the pits. After months of trying, Fox finally gets 5 minutes with Gekko. Gekko is unimpressed with Fox until he reveals he has inside information about the outcome of an airline lawsuit. Thus begins the tutelage of the young and slightly naive Fox by the crafty cynic, Gordon Gekko. It's a wild ride that is a blast to be a part of but ultimately Fox and Gekko part ways and become bitter rivals in a contest that can only end with the destruction of one.Too often the corporate banker/investor/CEO is portrayed in a one dimensional, cookie cutter fashion in Hollywood (see Avatar). Greedy, soulless, and completely without any vestige of humanity or decency (see Captain Planet villains, and Avatar again) they exist as plot points but not as characters. Gordon Gekko is greedy, to be certain, but in the defining moment of his character he defends himself saying, ""Greed, for lack of a better word, is good."" He goes on to eloquently state his case to the shareholders of a company to convince them to go along with his plan to buy it, all the while secretly planning to screw them over, such is the world of high-stakes Wall Street investments. Oliver Stone might have been trying to make an ant-capitalist movie, but only succeeded in creating a capitalist icon that inspired a generation of Wall Street sharks. Cheers to you Stone, if only he could fail like this more often.",Wall Street
132,Magenta_Bob,Fairly forgettable story about greed and excess,6,5 March 2011,"In light of the recent economic crisis, Oliver Stone's 1987 classic Wall Street seems as relevant as ever. While it is not about economic matters in itself, it is easy to see how a market like the one depicted in the film, with people like the ones in the film, could spawn an economic breakdown. Unfortunately, apart from that, there is really nothing remarkable about Wall Street; we have seen the story of a man striving for power and success a million times, if not in this environment.First of all, Stone's direction is nothing out of the ordinary. The music alternates between interesting song choices like the David Byrne songs and Fly Me to the Moon, and being mildly annoying. The visuals are far from impressive, even though there are some pretty pictures of New York to look at, and the way the camera becomes a bit unsteady when something particularly intense is going on is interesting until Stone takes it too far, like when he turns a scene between Charlie and Martin Sheen that could have been great into something resembling a tennis game. Furthermore, I feel like there is sometimes a fine line between making a film that describes a lack of taste, and simply making a tasteless film that indulge in excess. In other words, Wall Street has aged badly in some aspects.That being said, the film does feature some highly memorable performances, Michael Douglas' deliciously sleazy Gordon Gekko being the highlight. The dialog might rely too heavily on one-liners, but in a way it makes sense that, in a film that is partly dealing with superficiality, half of all the lines in the film sound like an advertising slogan. And at least some of them are good slogans; surely it is hard not to be swayed when Douglas proclaims that ""greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit"".",Wall Street
133,jtpaladin,Plot Holes & Socialism galore,1,18 October 2005,"This was a fun movie except for two things: (1) Oliver Stone's hatred of the free market; (2) The film had massive plot holes.First, the free market, unlike what Gecko says, is not a zero-sum game. In the free market, people enter into agreements freely, exchange goods & services, and get what they want. Everyone wins. Yes, there are some cases where people lose but that's not the nature of the free market. In the socialist world, yes, life is a zero sum game. You work hard and the govt. takes whatever it wants. Oliver Stone doesn't understand something that simple because he's a hardcore left-wing lunatic.Second, why did Gecko meet Bud at the end and not assume that he's not wired? And biggest of all, why did the Unions at Blue Star not get an agreement from Gecko that he wouldn't liquidate the company? I mean, this is exactly what Gecko is known for doing so why not put in a simple clause protecting the company? Why? Because the deal would have been perfect and would have ruined Stone's film.Thirdly, Bud Fox would not have gone to jail at the end of the film. Any good lawyer would have gotten his client off by handing Gecko to the Feds at the end. Frankly, in reality, Bud would have gotten off, got an executive position with Blue Star and enjoyed the financial success he dreamt of for so long. But Stone wanted to end the film on a tragic note and send a message about insider trading.As usual, Stone mixed facts with fantasy to tell his story and his heavy-handedness ruined a fun story.",Wall Street

I'm not the sort of person that takes anything more than enjoyment from a film but it's hard not to take a ride with the main character and learn the same lessons that he does. Charlie Sheen is excellent as the main character and Martin Sheen really provides the grounding to a film that wouold otherwise sweep you off into the distance. When it comes down to it Michael Douglas can be a pretty soul-less actor that really sets the negative tone of the film, playing the bad guy stock broker. All round fantastic young performances by David Spade and Dr.Cox from Scrubs provide a supporting cast that gives depth and solidity to all the characters. The only thing boring about the film is the predictability of the ending and the way the pace really slows down, you know the ending 15 minutes before it happens but the lead up to it is a fantastic film.",Wall Street
135,maitreg,Best financial movie of all time,8,9 January 2001,"Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen are at their best.  Martin Sheen is his usual cool self.

Fox gets caught up in all the hundreds of thousands of dollars flowing in his direction and he loses sight of the more important things in life.  Only when Gekko tries to ruin Fox's father's (Martin Sheen) employer, a commercial airline, does he see the error in his ways.Daryl Hannah plays Darien Taylor, a neo interior decorator with a nose for the big bucks.  She falls for Fox as the money rolls in.  There's not a lot of bad things to say about this movie, except that Hannah is terribly miscast.

136,treadwaywrites,Very Relevant,8,27 March 2009,"""Greed is good."" Gordon Gecko proudly offers that idea or perhaps way of life lived by the elite of the stock market. Gecko explains it best when he talks about making nothing except wealth. Gecko signifies for many what they believe New York and the financial markets to be which is one big sham. The movie is not a burning question or even a quest for the truth as much as a hypothesis and then argument for the truth of excess. Right from the beginning of the movie Oliver Stone shows what he thinks of the tainted system and the superficial people in it.The story follows Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen), a young, struggling stock trader, looking for shortcuts in the market and ways to get rich quick. He works the phones, trying to find new clients who have the money and the where with all to make him wealthy without getting old in the process. Gordon Gecko is the man in this world of make believe and money. Gecko has it all and more importantly has it all to offer. Gecko teaches Bud Fox just how the world works, how people like him gobble up entire companies. He provides Fox with a tall, blonde girlfriend by way of Daryl Hannah and even manages to make him balance his best friend (James Spader) by way of his slight of hand business dealings. The most prominent theme throughout Oliver Stone's film is greed and it is what binds everyone in the film.Charlie Sheen carries the movie along with veteran Michael Douglas. Douglas won Best Actor for his portrayal. There are some very corny scenes that involve Martin Sheen but thankfully they are lost in the body of the film. Generally the film holds up under scrutiny and is very easy to understand which is something that can't always be said of stock market pictures and stories. The world of high finance is always easy to follow since everyone knows what greed is and that is always the way the film is framed.I confess it took a couple of viewings of the film to come around to my good side. Stone manages to put the entire financial system on trial rather than just those manipulating the system. He shows the system for what it is and how the corrupt few at the top keep getting richer on the backs of those at the bottom.",Wall Street
137,ramsfan,Great Douglas Vehicle,9,7 July 2012,"Oliver Stone's Wall Street accurately depicts segments of the corporate world and perfectly illustrates the yuppie snobbery, greed and excess of the 1980's. It is a movie that though somewhat dated still has tremendous relevance today in light of the Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae scandals and recent government bailouts of the auto industry. The film follows young broker Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen), whose aspirations rise above being simply one of the legions of working brokers at a large firm. Wanting instant success and wealth, he tries to ""Bag the Elephant"", and doggedly pursues corporate raider Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) in hopes of landing a big account. His perseverance eventually pays off and Gekko entrusts the young broker with a number of smaller transactions and as he gains his trust begins to tutor him on the ways of the investment world. Fox becomes totally entranced by the wealth and prestige associated with being a Gekko confidant and is gradually lured into the murky world of insider trading.When Gekko presses Fox to ""surprise him"" with an investment opportunity, he mentions Blue Star Airlines, a floundering firm for whom his father works and serves as a Union Steward. Blue Star has an over funded pension account, and Fox' loyalty is put to the test when despite assurances to the contrary, the ruthless Gekko decides to buy the airline and break it up, putting his father and thousands of others out of work. Resentful and guilt-ridden at having been used to do Gekko's dirty work, Fox hatches a plan to rectify his mistake and save the airline, but at a tremendous cost.I consider this film to be Douglas' finest work. He perfectly embodies the unseemly cutthroat raider to whom no amount of wealth is enough. His ""Greed is Good"" mantra entered the lexicon and perfectly illustrates 80's corporate thinking. Sheen delivers as the young, idealistic upstart who bites off more than he can chew. Fine character work is turned in by Hal Holbrook as a fellow old school broker who stresses doing things patiently and ethically instead of chasing the quick buck. Ditto for Martin Sheen as Bud's honorable working class father and Darryl Hannah as the hot decorator Fox lands with his newly found wealth. Particularly enjoyable is the performance of Terence Stamp as Sir Laurence Wildman, a raider even more powerful than Gekko.Wall Street is entertaining and has a message.

140,andy-933-696608,Wall Street movie review,8,12 March 2011,"I confess that I know nothing about the market, nor do I know much about general economics. However on a positive note, anyone, even a dunce at their typical economics class can easily determine the pace of the film through the detailed, and I'm trusting accurate descriptions of stocks and bonds through the knowledge of Charlie Sheen's performance as the persistent Bud Fox. We know when the buck is being made, and when it's being lost, as well as the very competitors themselves. The hero of this tale of financial chaos is looking to make money and become a big time Wall Street broker. The struggles he encounters in his own career as a broker are what challenge his drive to achieve more. Unfortunately his ambition his motivated by the concept of his worth in financial gains, rather than the self worth a worker makes out of pure pride. Money is essential, and I personally believe in the value of survival being determined by the size of a man's wallet. However Bud can't deny the honest words of a responsible machinist like his father Car (Martin Sheen). It takes a good while for that kind of dignity to reach Bud, as he is taken into the wing, and teachings of his Wall Street idol Gordon Gekko (Douglas). Defined by charisma, ruthless perseverance, and furthermore a knowledge that goes far beyond Buds, as it expresses his confidence to succeed further in this crazy world of mind nerving numbers. Bud could present tons of various stocks and shares, only for Gekko to dismiss it as mere garbage. Its' the real inside info that none can access that truly peak his interests. ""Blue Star Airlines"" the very Airline that gives Bud's father his pride as both a machinist, and a union president, had just evaded a lawsuit involving maintenance problems, and the kind of leak gave Gekko a keen interest in Bud. Of course, it would take so much more than just a small spill on one business to get Bud up top. Bud's own sense of honest work is flipped at the very temptations Gordon presents, money, luxury, and even a chance to score with a former lover, and I might have to say the weakest part of this film, Darian (Hannah). She is neither beautiful, nor a believable in her roll as Gekko's former lover, nor Buds trophy girlfriend. Every line she brings sounds like that from an aroused prostitute. She just comes off too sexy. In know for most guys that's a good thing, but only if she actually was sexy, when clearly she should just be normal, and a little less shallow. I can see the effort she puts into her portrayal, unfortunately it would be better off in a porn flick, rather than a drama as sophisticated as the very talent of Oliver Stone. Bud's own sense of honor is replaced by greed as he further develops in the manner in which Gordon plays the so called game, where money could matter less. ""It's about the Game"", strong words coming from a man who has loads of money. Maybe that is what defines Gekko's own pride as the player that he is. Unfortunately, in the mind of Bud Fox, that logic clearly reveals the very difference among them. Bud's betrayal to the man he looked towards as a hero is ended in a quick change of sides, choosing his father's own responsibilities towards Blue Star. It actually sounded like a sweet gig, expanding it, bumping Bud to the presidential seat, and yes maybe firing tons of workers, which is exactly where he and Gekko truly stand apart. Buds betrayal stems farther than just switching sides, and teaming up with Gekko's rival Sir Lawrence Wildman (Stamp), but so much as to wear a wire spilling every little secret Gordon could keep to the cops. Justice is served, Bud's conscience is clean, and a road is open for him. A road where maybe at the very price of a punishment like prison can truly make Bud see. Sheens portrayal shows that of a hard worker, with both honest virtues, and a sorted sense of dignity, only with the severe weak points that Gordon further breaks, and infects with the temptations of the rewards of Greed. ""Greed is Good"", a speech that despite it's logic of results and inspirations brings the beliefs of the ruthless broker to a more clear sense. Gekko believes Greed to be the very thing that has kept us going, and maybe he's right on the levels of motivation. However the limits to how greedy a human being could be can never be good when they reach their ultimate dark ends. Director Oliver Stone has brought audiences an authentic depiction of the very business his father Lou Stone worked in. The specific moments of silence, just seconds before the numbers appear, the details to each individual action towards buying or dumping stock, and the notion of respectful pride towards all too consuming greed are what make ""Wall Street"" a film worthy of Stone's Best Picture Winner ""Platoon"". The chaos of the brokers looking to buy, sell, and dump their shares is accurately displayed with not only it's characters alone, but with the very scenes of the stock market, showing the very craziness these guys yell, scream, and even rip their hair off for. And another congrats to the great Michael Douglas, as he brings to life a character who is moved by the very concept of greed, but not on a matter of money, but out of his own desire to simply emerge victorious in the end. He shows a relaxed compliance with his clients, zero BS from losses or failures, and a philosophical approach to the very business he's good at.",Wall Street

Marvin (McGinley) is a talented account executive, a ""mindreader"" who predicted the Challenger explosion. In a tribute to the morals of the earlier generation, Stone has his protagonist Marvin make a $100 loan to debt-dodging colleague Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen). Fox, a despicable fellow who is shown making his daily call to harass an innocent receptionist, has no time for the simple act of repayment. Whether hitting on an attached decorator at a party or stalking a knighted philanthropist, Fox is the yin to heroic Marvin's yang.As time goes on Fox's refusal to repay Marvin's generosity reaches epic proportions, with Fox even berating Marvin in front of the entire office. Fox subsequently uses a fake apology to manipulate Marv into putting his best clients into Blue Star knowing that the share price will soon plummet (thanks to insider knowledge Fox obtained illegally). Going to the limit in the climactic scene, Fox arranges his own arrest (for the aforementioned insider trading and other shady dealings) to take place in front of Marvin as a final insult.

The ""greed is good"" mentality, while it certainly has its merits, is twisted by Gekko into a doctrine of immoral excess, where money is paid for by the livelihoods of the working man. Gekko, the Devil in a tailored suit, proves that he's willing to do anything for a profit long after money has become anything other than a scoreboard.While there are a number of incredibly well-executed performances to speak of (Sheen and Sheen being the ones to come to mind), Michael Douglas gives us one of the decade's best. Seamlessly sliding into Gekko's skin, Douglas breathes realism into the coldly calculating and darkly charismatic character. He doesn't merely seduce Bud with his mean and hungry look (to borrow from Shakespeare), but the entire audience as well: all of us swept up in his charm and obvious grandeur. Gekko possesses his office with a commanding presence, like a retro Zeus in his temple on Wall Street.While enough can't be said for Stone's exceptional direction, it's his and Wesier's brilliant screenplay which completely steals the show. Particularly in the ""Greed is Good"" speech, they capture the Darwinian nature of economics and the a-moral (if not outright immoral) philosophy that defined the eighties (and every decade since). One merely has to look to Wall Street today to see the film's timelessness: the 2007 housing crisis (which has yet to be satisfactorily resolved, if the Wall Street occupation is any indication) and the Enron scandal are merely the largest and most recent examples.This is a film that every American, without exception, should watch. While it may only truly appeal to lovers of Drama and finance, it is far too relevant to today's economic crises and of far too excellent a quality to go unseen.",Wall Street

The film revolves around his experiences as he narrates his letter to his grandma. Martin Sheen is also good as the soldier sent in to kill a rogue soldier, General Mendoza, yet another star turn by Branscombe Richmond. However it is Charlie Sheen's film as two soldiers battle for his soul. Sergeant Elias (Clancy Brown) is world weary and tired of killing but does it anyway. Sergeant Barnes (Bill Cosby) is the ruthless killer who will do anything to ensure the machine doesnt break down.

149,mauricepfeife,"OK, even though it is good... kinda",6,22 April 2017,"I think this movie achieves almost perfect what it wants. A nice story about the Wall Street, money and crave. The camera gives nice images from New York, the actors are good (even though I sometimes find Charlie Sheen to act a little over the top), and the story has nice depth and a message. It perfectly shows what crave and money can do with you. It is able to destroy relationships, even your life. BUT: The story is just boring. It is so well made, but because it is so not relatable it is boring. Added to that, I wasn't really worried about the characters, I didn't feel for them, because if you think of it, you realize they are not in real danger. I mean... if Buddie would have failed on half of his way, what would have happened to him? He would have continued his ""normal"" lifestyle. That is just not that exciting. That is why the movie is just 'ok' for me",Wall Street
150,spinin,Tough and Ruthless or Rough and Toothless?,8,20 April 2001,"Half the time, I have absolutely no idea what the characters in ""Wall Street"" are talking about. The good thing is that I don't have to in order to understand this movie. I hope not. Bonds, stocks, withdrawals, savings accounts, points, credit cards, whatever it all boils down to common human emotions people can relate to.Charlie Sheen plays Bud Fox, a young, eager stockbroker looking for a lucky break in his unsatisfying career. It is clear that the man has plenty of motivation as he constantly calls up one of the stock market gods, Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas), hoping to get his foot in the door. He finally succeeds and gets a meeting with Gekko on his birthday when he shows up with a box of Cuban cigars for a gift. He tries real hard to impress Gekko in their brief meeting, but is mostly unsuccessful. That is until he uses some inside information on an airline he got from his dad (Martin Sheen- real life dad too. Isn't that ironic) who happens to work there. His tip for Gekko is a good one, but it is also an illegal one. It impresses Gekko who decides to get Fox involved and really teach him about the stuff on the inside.I don't know what it is with their names, but they're a little bit too suggestive. Bud is as smart as a Fox and he finds ways to outwit people. Sheen is not as good here as in Platoon where his ""average guy"" presence was more effective. He needs to show more emotion and surprise here. He does redeem himself with better scenes near the end of the movie. Douglas almost looks like a lizard with his slick hair and slim face. Of course, he acts like one too. And the Oscar speaks of his performance. I guess those names are pretty cool. Terence Stamp has one of the coolest names in real life and he plays Gekko's rival in ""Wall Street."" I really like this guy. He has this fearlessly cold look on his face, whoever he's playing. I would never mess with him. Then there's Daryl Hannah who plays a personal decorator and Fox's girlfriend. I don't know why this character is in this movie. She has a very pointless and meaningless role and Hannah plays it in an extremely artificial and awkward way. I guess she reflects Gekko and his greed in a more subtle way that eventually sneaks up on Fox.Of course Oliver Stone does a great job directing this film. When the stock market first opens in the movie and Fox picks up the phone, the tone immediately changes. Everyone goes into panic mode including the cameras. I never understood how this works. How can these people handle three hundred phone calls, voices, and their computer screens or notes all at the same time? I can almost understand the office brokers' jobs, but what is going on down on the trading floor? What are they doing? Betting? Millions of people are bidding on something and this one guy writes it down on a tiny little piece of paper. Does he know what he's doing? Does he write down the name of the guy who bought the shares? I don't know and the movie certainly doesn't explain. That's not what it's about. Simply put, ""Wall Street"" is about greed and the destruction of everything that's weaker in order to gain wealth or power. Douglas embodies that in his performance as Gekko. Fox learns about it through the experience. ""Wall Street"" is actually similar to ""American Psycho,"" another movie about the excess of the eighties. Obviously, ""American Psycho"" chooses to show that the businessmen of those days were literally getting away with murder. ""Wall Street"" is a very good film, although sometimes it is too confusing with its lingo. I guess that makes it good on two levels. The plot is universal enough for everyone to enjoy, but it also has a level that Donald Trump can enjoy (I don't think he really does this stuff though). I haven't seen ""Boiler Room,"" but I would be willing to bet that ""Wall Street"" is probably a better movie. It should be seen at least for the performance Michael Douglas puts in. I give it an 8 out of 10. By the way, Gordon, Gekko, God, Greed, and Grand all start with ""G's."" Coincidence?",Wall Street
151,aefrench,Good film,8,15 September 2010,"With the sequel to this film coming out later this month, I decided to watch this one. It was actually a movie I had wanted to see for quite a while, but never got around to watching it. After seeing Wall Street, I can definitely recommend it.Bud Fox is a young stockbroker working at a New York firm. It's rough work, with values of stocks constantly changing and being on the phone with clients all day. Speaking of which, there is one person that Bud really wants as a client: Gordon Gekko.Gekko is THE major player on Wall Street, and Fox has tried for a couple of months to meet him. After buying Gekko a box of his favorite cigars as a birthday gift, he is granted a chance to meet the famous investor.Fox makes his pitch to Gekko, and is given a chance to prove himself, with Gekko having him make a couple of investments. One of those investments does not work out, and Gekko decides that he and Fox cannot do business. Fox asks for another chance, and Gekko then proceeds to tell him the Gordon Gekko way of doing business. If Fox can follow that, Gekko will give him another chance.After thinking about it, Fox decides to play by Gekko's rules, and works his way up to being Gekko's right-hand man, getting everything he has dreamed of. However, will it come with a price? This is another example of a movie that is good with just a decent script and fine acting. Michael Douglas is excellent as Gordon Gekko, who is the man who you love to hate. For any Dallas fans reading this review, think of Gekko as the New York version of J.R. Ewing. He loves the investment world, much like J.R. loved the oil world, and both are ruthless. Douglas deserved the Oscar he won for this role. Sheen isn't bad as the young and impressionable Fox, a far cry from his role on Two and a Half Men. And I also enjoyed the scenes he had with his dad, who plays a blue collar man, the complete opposite of Gekko.Before I wrote this review, I was thinking about how this movie is very much a morality tale. And it is a well done morality tale. And after saying that, I cannot wait for the sequel to come out.",Wall Street
152,secordman,Entertaining and still relevant,9,21 May 2001,"Wall Street could have fit in very nicely in the theatres today.  The bull market of the late 80's can be compared to the insane dot.com market of the late 90's, the same mistakes made on Wall Street repeated themselves again. Hal Holbrook's character is the voice of reason in Wall Street, telling Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) to stick to the basics, and not get carried away with going for the easy buck.  Fox is entranced by dynamo Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas), whose specialty is taking over and ""wrecking"" companies, ""because they're wreckable"".  Gekko takes Fox in as his protege, teaching him the ropes and showing him the realities of greed.  Fox becomes corrupted, and despite the sobering influence of his union man dad (Martin Sheen) gets ensnared in Gekko's web.  Great performances all around, Douglas was deserving of the Oscar, Charlie Sheen was very good in his role as well. There are terrific supporting roles in this movie; Martin Sheen, Holbrook, Terence Stamp and Oliver Stone's favourite character actor, John C. McGinley.  For all of Stone's later failed movies, Wall Street hits the nail on the head, and above all entertains the audience.

153,elect_michael,"Great film, Stone, Douglas, Sheen's and Supporting Cast Deliver",8,28 August 2021,"Oliver Stone's vision shines through with gravity defying momentum in a film that many historians say is one of his five or six Masterpieces. I agree with the Masterpiece status of this film, it's a truly great piece of Cinema.Michael Douglas stars alongside Charlie Sheen and Martin Sheen. Charlie Sheen delivers a good Performane in this film and he keeps up with his Martin Sheen and Michael Douglas, which is saying a ton. Many Actors would overreach trying to keep up with Michael Douglas and Martin Sheen, but Charlie Sheen reaches just enough without crossing the line to deliver a good performance.Martin Sheen is such a crafty Actor, he has dynamic subtleties as an Actor that make him so commanding, unique and interesting to watch. He really performs great in this film and the 'hospital bed' scene is the kind of scene that College Drama Professors would show their class as of how to Act while pointing out how incredibly hard it is to deliver a scene as such.Michael Douglas also is a Screen Commanding Actor, and you can't take your eyes off of him and the fact that he has the 'it' factor in most Films he's in. He's the kind of Actor, much like Martin Sheen, that you know you're watching greatness, but you can't quite put your finger on the why, but you know you're seeing it right before your very eyes on the screen; and this Film is no exception.In smaller roles, Terence Stamp puts on an extremely good performance that not many could do as the part called to basically be as or more commanding than Michael Douglas, and Stamp has the talent and craft to do it, and the scenes with Stamp and Douglas flat out work; and as with all of these scenes, Stone captures it almost perfectly.Also in smaller roles, James Spader performs good in a part that many Actors would've over or under reached; Spader does neither and delivers. Hal Holbrook's scenes work, flat out, and quietly as he so often does. John C. McGinley performs extremely well as he almost always does, and without stealing scenes, he performs with a high level of energy bordering on a 'live' performance; it works, no question.",Wall Street

This is director Oliver Stone (Born on the Fourth of July, Colors) at his best. It stars Michael Douglas (The Game, A Perfect Murder) at his best also in the role that inspired a generation of clones, the Machiavellian villain Gordon Gecko. Gecko is a Wall Street stock trader and a corporate raider. His personality has the bombastic swagger of Trump with the business ethics of Bernie Madoff. Budd Foxx is his protégé, played by Charlie Sheen (Two and a Half Men, Men at Work). A hostile takeover pits Fox against his father, the head of the union. The part of Fox's father is played by Sheen's real- life father Martin Sheen (The Departed, The Dead Zone). The love interest is played by actress Darryl Hannah (Kill Bill: Vol. 1, Splash). She was big in the '80s, but I never got her look. Wall Street is a morality play. The dialogue crackles with memorable, quotable lines. This picture was influential. It set fashion trends well into the '90s and to this day. Wall Street came to be associated with the greed of '80s culture. The real-life ""Gordon Gecko"" was none other than Ivan Boesky. This guy was like the Bernie Madoff of the 1980s. Boesky was into insider trading, what they popped Martha Stewart for. ""Budd Fox"" was Michael Miliken, "" The Junk Bond King.""

156,peterlonglongplong,Unreal movie,3,5 May 2008,"It was a decently entertaining movie, but it's so far from reality. I've known enough 'RICH' people in my life to see that the script to this movie was weak. Rarely will these corporate money fishers ever even think about the morals of what they do. They talk about morals even less. They are on a mission. Goals are set in their very self-centered world and they do whatever they have to do. They laugh when they cut-off at the pass some other gambler (that is what the stock market is, a casino). They think and act like Ayn Rand. Who was the only person on this planet that mattered in the life of Ayn Rand? AYN RAND!!! Literally, the money thirsty nuts who profit on speculation and fixing the cards their way, have no feeling of remorse for anyone else. They play life like the board game ""LIFE"". If a corporate decision made in their company's board room results in one of their factories poisoning to death thousands of innocent people, they think like our present day government does to war. The dead people are unfortunate civilian casualties. This is because the corporate leaders are at war. Their war is over ownership of everything possible, including the surfs. That's right, if you are not one of the Lords, you are their servant. You are absolutely expendable. This movie has high level officials blurting out moral directives that they would, in fact, never even think about. And, I agree with many of the other reviews, Darryl Hannah was not good in this movie. She's a producers daughter and I can't help but wonder how mediocre actors/actresses get their roles in movies.

157,haasxaar,Wealth or Humanity?,9,16 January 2006,"Let's get this straight. Ronald Reagan is a bitch and I hate unchecked capitalism. I think its pure evil, its everything that creates unease and difficulty in this world. Responsible for so much pain; yet why is it so loved and adored by American politicians and the American public? Stone helps answer that question in some sense.Stone delves deep into the mindset of a greedy, amoral stockbroker who feeds on success, on making money. Yet money is just a means to an end; he is just a predator, using his morphed ideals of economic Darwinism to justify his actions. He acts without morality, because in one line of the film Douglas declares 'love is for the weak'. What Stone does so well though is not just depict an aggressive cut-throat capitalist, he shows the background they arise from. He shows how they become powerful because the system nurtures it, encourages such behaviour; in simple terms that 'greed is good'.Stone portrays his subject matter in a realistic and seemingly objective manner. He portrays the pure superficiality of the world that economists and monetarians live in. There are many great scenes with Douglas often going at length to profess his nihilism, his abject disdain for principles. The script is very good, though full of technical terms it never becomes too complex for the viewer to ever become alienated. The cast is strong and Douglas delivers a knockout blow as the main antagonist.Capitalism is undoubtedly the world leading economic system now. It is unrealistic to claim that there is a viable alternative ; we cannot though, let such unethical practises prevail when we let capitalism go unfettered. Without letting this commentary devolve into a political statement it must be simply stated that what Stone conveys with great power is that life is more than just money, why should we sacrifice our humanity for wealth? How much is enough? How many people do we lay off and leave homeless and without healthcare before we realise that people, not materials are what matter?

Or maybe the message is that only bad guys like Gordon Gecko believe lunch is for wimps. I am not sure. If I were going to make a film about capitalism, I might have more to say about the human and environmental costs.One good thing about this film is James Spader's brief appearance, as one of the bad guys who likes insider trading and asset stripping. He demonstrates how it is possible to screw people whilst remaining fully clothed. This, alongside the rather similar character he played in ""Baby Boom"", epitomise the ""devious blond yuppy"" phase of his career. I once googled ""devious blonde yuppy"" to see if his name came up - and it did, three times in the first ten hits. Later, with ""Dream Lover"" and ""Wolf"", we can see this phase of his career go from merely playing devious men to characters that are actively deviant and (in the case of those two films, evil).This is not a bad film, but it is not the film that I would have made had I been given the budget and the stars.",Wall Street

My only awareness of the film being through endless replays of Gordon Grekko's ""Greed is good"" speech, I wanted to see how Oliver Stone crafted his polemic to the booming capitalism of the 1980s.The film takes an important subject matter (corporate excess and insider trading) and tries to make it accessible to the audience, though at times I felt lost. I suppose they tried to dumb it down for a Hollywood audience, but that didn't work all the time for me--I found a lot of the secret deals fuzzy and the exact details of some situations confusing, even though I could understand that Gekko was trying to cheat the system. Perhaps this is because the whole concept of the stock market is difficult to wrap my head around! I did enjoy some performances, though not exactly the ones the film is known for. Martin Sheen is great as Bud Fox's dad, the blue collar worker who feels stiffed by the rich and who acts as the moral center of the film. Terence Stamp gives a fine performance as a wealthy businessman in a rivalry with Gekko, though is screen time is too little. And John C. McGinley hits the right note as Charlie Sheen's co-worker, foreshadowing a comedic career. Michael Douglas gave a decent performance, though his standout scene is really only the ""Greed is good"" speech, which probably won him the Oscar. Unfortunately, veteran actor Hal Holbrook is left to dispense aphorisms as the Wise Old Stock Trader, and the female roles are vastly underwritten.""Wall Street"" is a serious movie about a serious topic, and that is the question of who really controls America. As we saw with Enron and with the subprime fiasco, it is the super rich, many of whom seem content with putting profit before people.

Every scene which did NOT include Daryl Hannah was a pleasure to watch and listen to. You really felt the greed in Michael Douglas' Gordon Gecko and could feel the changes in Charlie Sheen's Bud Fox, but whenever Daryl walk on the screen, the entire energy flow that was present beforehand, was completely obliterated by her presence. Up until this role, her best parts were a mermaid (Splash), an android (Blade Runner), and a cave-woman (Clan of the Cave Bear - there were no speaking parts in this one.).

We enter Bud Fox (a great performance by Charlie Sheen, more familiar to audiences as the womaniser Charlie Harper from the hit TV show ""Two and a half Men"") a relatively insignificant broker on wall street, who dreams of getting to the top. His idol, Gordon Gekko (the Academy Award winning, best acted and most famous role of Michael Douglas), seems to be his way to his goals and when given the chance from Gekko to prove himself, he strives. As Bud becomes richer and more powerful the schemes begin as does the guilt with his father (Charlie's real life dad Martin Sheen) when Gekko's plans become more deadly... Oliver Stone hit gold with the academy award winning ""platoon"", also starring Charlie Sheen, and people had doubts whether he could follow up his success with ""Wall Street."" All doubts were soon demolished. The performances are brilliant, obviously Douglas' character is the one that comes to mind, but also is the underrated and arguably the best performance by Charlie Sheen who really proves his acting chops with this challenging role.

That shouldn't determine how entertaining the film is, and doesn't (if you put it on in the background while doing something else). I'd seen it twice before and after catching a cable TV showing a decade later was surprised at the creaky screenplay and acting. Michael Douglas's entire performance is good enough for his own highlight reel but everyone else in it just left me groaning, even Charlie Sheen's dad as the blue-collar old-fashioned salt-of-the-earth stock character.

Sample genius: beginning with ""1985"" flashed importantly across the screen, a few minutes before John C.

168,MrSharma,Pretty good...but not perfect,10,26 November 2005,"""Wall Street"", written and directed by multiple Oscar Winning director Oliver Stone, is a remarkable picture that captures the fundamental characteristics of many of Stone's films: greed, ambition, relationships and the seemingly inherent desire to make as much money as possible in the smallest time frame possible. And so emerges the story of Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen), an ambitious young executive working for a large stock-broking firm situated on Wall Street. With intense aspirations of being a Wall Street ""player"" like his personal hero Gordon Gekko (an unforgettable Michael Douglas), his pursuit of cash, women and expensive suits lead him to a moral dilemma between his father (Martin Sheen) and Gekko and ultimately to a confrontation of ethics within business and personal redemption. From the amazing and unquestionably talented Oliver Stone, this film doesn't quite rank up amongst his greatest achievements (JFK, Born on the 4th of July, Platoon) but nonetheless provides a piece of entertainment that is by far greater than the majority of films that end up winding through the reels at your local theatres. Stone's ability to confront controversial issues is practically unparalleled in the generally ""safe"" and conservative industry of Hollywood, and this film is no exception. With its case study of corporate ethics, and its comments on the concept of insider trading within the American stock-broking community, this film is a success on the professional level of looking at business as well as the more personal elements, including the hard-line philosophies of Gordon Gekko and furthermore the nature of the ambition that eats away at Bud Fox. The acting is excellent on the part of both Charlie and Martin Sheen as their respective roles as father and son, however the clear stand-out performance throughout the picture is clearly that of Michael Douglas in his brilliant, Oscar-winning portrayal of the ruthless Gordon Gekko. Daryl Hannah, however, remains a substantial dent to the film's overall credibility and poses a serious case of mis-casting on the part of Oliver Stone that is essentially unforgivable when watching Hannah's pathetic attempts at working alongside such greats as Martin Sheen and Michael Douglas. Her complete inability to illustrate even the most basic of emotions is ridiculous, and provides many cringe-worthy moments where you will invariably begin to question the integrity of Hollywood and its casting system. The cinematography and the editing are indeed top notch, and Stone's direction is brilliant and true to itself as it always is. Overall, an entertaining picture that is a must-see for any film-goer or indeed anybody interested in making (or losing) big bucks within the ruthless and cut-throat industry of big business. Considering Stone himself, you're pretty sure that the film is going to be good, yet this is unfortunately a little too thin within such a large and monumental context, that can't help but detract from the film. A good film though, and thoroughly enjoyable.",Wall Street
169,clipmaker,"So, so",3,16 July 2011,"When we want to understand a character in a movie we look at his entourage, and what we see in this movie is practically to much effort put into that and not much left for the character himself. And in a movie we watch what's happening in the moment and we don't follow a narrative story for too long. Otherwise it is like a surrogate, an artificial combination of scenes that could have been better connected to one another no matter how good was the actor's performance, and we still cannot understand what we are watching. Also, to comment on a particular scene, there is no such a thing to see someone walking out from a business meeting throwing words, and blaming a guy who he just met. Nobody does that nowadays, and that guy happened to be his son's boss. Come on! So, many scenes are like wrong from the start and the tension that is build up in the movie doesn't look a bit real to make it believable at all. By the way, the works of arts displayed on this movie no matter what the price tag says about their values are indeed in discrepancy with what most of us see now fashionable. Back to 80s? No way!",Wall Street
170,jon-fougner-966-434081,Reflections from YLS Capitalism + Film Seminar,6,21 February 2013,"Perfect competition requires perfect information. But it also entails zero profit. And since profit is ""better than sex,"" that's something that ""Wall Street""'s (1987) Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) and his lap dog Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) just can't abide. So perfect information is their roadkill. Oliver Stone's Wall Street is one that, far from promoting efficient markets, hoards, corrupts or shreds every shred of data it can get its hands on—even birthday cards. Fox's struggles with information would prefigure Sheen's own struggle to define his public persona as his predilection for prostitutes and blow seeped out, a battle in which Sheen ultimately threw in the towel by consenting to a Comedy Central roast.Information is coin of Stone's realm. When Fox asks a sales colleague to predict the market, he answers: ""If I knew, I wouldn't be in this business."" Indeed, he'd be in Gekko's. Fox quests to make that very leap —hence the signage for a company called ""Info Quest"" than Stone unsubtly gives us a glimpse of. All secrets are in play. Even Gekko's birthdate is an unearthed informational stepping stone towards those portending double doors. And everyone is breathing from the respirator of the ticker tape.Even Gekko. But sans inside information, Gekko's patience for Fox lasts only minutes (of story time—or seconds of screen time). ""If you're not inside, you're outside,"" Gekko admonishes. Few are more despicable to him than the snake oil salesmen of ""technical trading""—men who pretend to possess information when they have only hunches. Gekko's appetite for *real* information is insatiable: his office boasts state-of-the-art monitors, a coterie of well-connected traders, and most importantly, a multi-story window on the world. Outside of the office, Gekko has a magic wand: that iconic cell phone connecting him back to his nerve centers. Lest we miss the point, Stone and co-writer Stanley Weiser leave us with such gems as ""Information is everything""—not everything can be as quotable as ""Greed is good.""Stone isn't shy with his symbolism, either. As soon as Gekko conscripts Fox as his spy, the latter dons a pair of aviators, whether indoors or out. The shots of their opaque reflective coating recall—as do many films' shots of such sunglasses—the assaultive but introjective gaze of the policeman who pulls over Marion in Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" (1960). Similarly emboldened, Fox now slinks his way from private restaurants to private airports in pursuit of information to feed to his master. Along the way, those shady shades are mirrored by the mirroring facades of the skyscrapers honored by aerial establishing shots peppered throughout the film: murder *won't* out. The shots also echo a show-off shot squarely into the reflective window of Fox's swanky new UES pad while he dines over candlelight with his foxy interior designer lady friend, at the peak of his puissance. But like the apartment's fake exposed brick, there's no there there, and Fox is left to wonder out on his vertiginous deck, in a line that would come to be parodied and parroted by ""Zoolander""'s (2001) Zoolander, ""Who am I?""Who he is, of course, is an insider trader. Info is Fox's ticket up, but it's also his ticket out. Or is it? Perhaps it's not too counter-textual to read his downfall as that of the man who knew *too little.* Too little about the SEC investigators on his heels, too little about how to make money honestly, too little about the laws of gravity.Most of all, too little about his own family. Stone and Fox are both at their most didactic when the latter blares as his father Carl (Martin Sheen, Charlie's father), who has just walked out on Gekko's pension- gutting proposal, ""What I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand his son being more successful than him!"" This is Stone's Marxist moralizing at its barest: the impudent son, who only speculates in capital, wrongly denigrating the wisdom of the father, who works with his hands. If ""money never sleeps,"" then it is surely the strumpet in Carl's retort, ""I don't go to sleep with no whore, and I don't wake up with no whore!""Oh, how life imitates art. ""Money,"" ""whores,"" and failing to follow in his father's noble footsteps would cut Charlie Sheen down to size yet again, two decades later. In 2011, the law of gravity—aided and abetted coke and booze—brought Sheen's stratospheric career and boyish jowls drooping back down to terra firma. When you can't argue with the data, your best bet is to argue with the interpretation. Sheen did so parsimoniously with a drumbeat of ""#winning,"" a meme that would transcend its Twitter origins as a watchword for self-defined success. The schadenfreude came to a head in Comedy Central's ""Roast of Charlie Sheen"" (2011), where host Seth MacFarlane introduced the guest of honor as having only been ""great in two things 25 years ago"" (likely referring to ""Wall Street"" and ""Platoon"" (1986)). MacFarlane continued: ""Carlos Estévez took his dad's name to gain credibility as an actor. I've seen your films, and you don't really act like a Sheen. But with your rap sheet and briefcases of coke, you're definitely acting like a Carlos.""Fox fils got a second chance to learn from the wisdom of his father. Let's hope the Sheen Jr. does, too.",Wall Street

172,bolt76,Hardly dated Stone film with memorable Michael Douglas,10,1 August 2009,"I found this film a fascinating watch. It's hardly dated (despite the 80s fashion) and compels you to think about concepts like competition, corporate ethics and profits.Stone clearly has a viewpoint- ""Create, instead of living off the buying and selling of others"". But, he and Michael Douglas also succeed in presenting a individual (Gecko) who, despite being all about personal profit at other peoples expense, is a simply magnetic personality Douglas give the role everything and makes it more multi layered than it is scripted. Indeed, despite Stone's best efforts, I couldn't help but feel that America was created by people like Gordon Gecko not Carl Fox (Martin Sheen)!Charlie Sheen is alright and his scenes with Martin Sheen work very well.Bottomline: Impressive viewing with a brilliant Michael Douglas 10/10",Wall Street

I can see why she didn't like playing that role. Douglas is always a joy to watch, and makes a suave yet slimy villain. I wouldn't necessarily say he deserved an Oscar, but he did a fine job nonetheless. So did Charlie Sheen, who is actually the star of the film despite the fact that most people remember ""Wall Street"" for Douglas as Gordon Gecko. Sheen gives a fine multi-dimensional performance. I love the scenes between him and his father Martin Sheen, who plays his father in the film. Oliver Stone made a great choice casting the father-and-son team, since the tension in their scenes feels very authentic.There are some predictable plot turns and character arcs, but altogether Stone keeps the excitement going. I like how the climactic scene between Douglas and Sheen is shot without cuts, with the camera moving from person to person, keeping the tension going. If I knew at least an inkling about the stock market, I wouldn't be completely lost during certain scenes, but what can you do? I still think it's a fine film with solid performances.",Wall Street
174,coreymoquin,Allusions to US,7,17 November 2011,"Oliver Stone's Wall Street is a perfect representation of how the rise of capitalism has completely shifted the culture and mindset of the United States and most of the modern world. The film poses two sides against each other and puts the audience in the same shoes as the protagonist. Charlie Sheen's character, Bud Fox, goes through multiple transformations throughout the film and it really makes the viewer question where they stand in today's economic climate. The economy in the 1980s was overall very good, right before the recession of the 1990s. Also, the United States transformation to becoming a fully capitalistic society was pretty much complete. Most of the American public during this time was unaware of what was going one with the economy. Oliver Stone films pretty much always have a deep meaning to them. Usually he alludes to how society functions in different eras. Stone's film Platoon is a good example of this. He showed a true representation of the Vietnam War, something that filmmakers rarely attempted. He showed how horrific and political the war was by showing how different races and people were treated. Wall Street also has these elements imbedded in the film.Wall Street presents two sides that face off against each other; capitalism and morality. Gordon Gekko represents capitalism. Gekko is a leech that feeds off of other people's success as a stockbroker. Gekko is greedy and has no morals; he will do anything just to gain more money. A good example of this is when he intentionally tries to destroy Martin Sheen's airline company. He could easily build the company up and make enough money, but he decides to diversify the shares so he can make an exorbitant amount of money. Then there is morality. Martin Sheen's character represents this side; the honest blue collar workers of middle class America. This side is the complete opposite of the capitalistic side. They aren't greedy and have values. There is a scene where Martin Sheen's character says he believes in creating something rather than leeching off other people's success. This bit of dialogue really encapsulates how his side believes how America should function. Wall Street is a film that was made in the 80's this belief still resonates strong over 20 years later. The middle ground between the two sides is Charlie Sheen's character, Buddy Fox. Oliver Stone probably wanted the viewer to be in the shoes of this character so they could come to some sort of a realization. Fox is pitted between these two sides and it is up to him to decide which side to choose. He goes through multiple transformations throughout the film. In the beginning he is idealistic and just wants to be a rich; to achieve the ""American Dream"". Eventually under the tutelage of Gekko he becomes callous and greedy. After Gekko attempts to destroy the company Fox has a realization of how immoral capitalism can be. He then goes to his father's side. The Fox character has some strong allusions to the American economy. In a way the American economy has gone through the same transformation; starting from idealistic roots and slowly becoming greedy and capitalistic. Perhaps Oliver Stone is providing hope with Buddy Fox's last transformation into a moral character. Stone might be conveying that if Fox can change his ways than maybe America can as well. Despite Stone having a good message it seems it has fallen on closed eyes because the country has become even more capitalistic.",Wall Street

176,Kill-Gore,"Wealth at the price of humanity, or humanity at the price of wealth?",10,3 September 2001,"Wall Street is about those for whom material wealth takes precedence over morality, and those for whom it does not. Moreover, it is the story of one who is struggling to decide which of the two he is: greedy or ethical.
Bud Fox is a young stock broker who only wishes to excel in life. His father, Carl, provides a strong moral foundation, prioritizing human life and well being over profit. Bud's mentor, Gordon Gekko, is a ruthless and legendary Wall Street player whose values couldn't conflict with those of Bud's father more perfectly. So caught in the middle is Bud, who pitches his father's airline to Gekko with the intentions of saving the company while everyone gets rich in the process. This business deal sets the stage for the conflict of interests Bud faces, and whether in the end it is his moral father or his greedy mentor he would most like to become.Wall Street is impeccably directed and perfectly cast. Oliver Stone really captures all the elements necessary to the telling of this story, with all its moral, economic, and legal implications. Michael Douglas is almost frightening as the ghastly Gordon Gekko, a role for which he took home the Oscar for best actor. And the casting of Martin and Charlie Sheen as father and son lends authenticity to their numerous emotional exchanges. We see what seem to be genuine hurt, pride, and shame from the two of them together. John C. McGinley makes his customary appearance in yet another of Stone's movies as Bud's coworker, and as always he shines, contributing his unique personality to the film. The combined efforts of talented individuals in a powerful story of human strength and weakness makes Wall Street a must see movie.I rate it 10/10.",Wall Street

No chemistry between Daryl Hannah and Charlie Sheen, either; only Oliver Stone could screw up a love scene with Daryl Hannah in it.

178,hjyguy,How far are you willing to go to be successful?,9,26 March 2006,"All through the movie I thought Michael Douglas' last name was Getco instead of Gekko. It must've been intended to be heard that way since Gordon Gekko's job mostly consists of getting companies.Simply a wonderful performance by Michael Douglas. Absolutely deserving of the Oscar award he received. He portrays Gordon Gekko, a city college grad who became a major force in the corporate takeover world. His impetus comes from a ""hungry mind"". He'd rather hire a person with a hungry mind over a high profile ivy-leaguer any day. With all the success and wealth he's achieved, he still despises the so-called wasps and distinguishes himself as a self-made billionaire.Greed is good, he says. Corporate USA needs more greed to maintain its status as a first-rate economy, according to Gekko. Driven by his greed, he does not show pity or any kind of remorse for the workers laid off following his corporate raid and bust-up. To him, satisfaction of his greed and the well-being of his family trumps any other societal or humanitarian value.Bob Fox (Charlie Sheen) starts off no different from Gekko. He comes from a blue collar family and made his way to the skyscrapers of Wall Street. As a stock broker, his only mandate is to earn greater profit for the investment company he works for and in the process accumulate as much wealth for himself. Before Gekko takes Fox into his team, he asks Fox numerous times if Fox ""has what it takes"". Fox himself was persuasive enough that he had what it took to be a winner. And he sure enjoyed climbing up the ladder, culminating in the ""perfect"" dinner with the gorgeous decorator (Darryl Hanna) in his new Upper East side condo.But out of ill fate Fox's run for success comes to a halt when it clashes with the only other thing he is shown to care about - his father. Gekko's attempt to bust-up Blueshoe Airlines, where his father is the union representative, makes Fox second guess his drive for success. Gekko has already set his eyes on the target and there's no settling for middle ground. Fox must choose between Gekko, representing greed and success, and his father, who stands for moral and humanitarian values. And he realizes at last that he is not cut out to become another Gekko.I guess the single most important question raised by this movie is this - how far are you willing to go to earn success? The movie put two people with similar makeup - Gekko and Fox - and shows the two coming out in different directions. It is most effectively portrayed in the Wall Street setting, but it also says a lot about the choices the population at large have to face. I for one am quite unsure what I would do if I were to face such a crossroad. To make up my mind, I'd first have to answer another question this movie raises - is greed really good? And if greed is good, how good is it? If your answer is in the affirmative, then the question would become, ""is greed a good enough value to outweigh the value at the other side?""",Wall Street
179,standforit,Competition and inspiration,9,6 October 2001,"Wall Street is a movie that is about winning. You can say that it is about greed, money - hungry people, rich folks - but in the end it comes down to the victory. Gekko (Douglas) is the only man for the role - a rich, yuppie, amoralistic man. He plays the character flawlessly. The only aspect that could have been improved is if Fox (Sheen) could have been more convincing in his role. Listen to the words in this film and you will certainly see that it is victory that spurs Gekko to keep playing the Game. Competition, within himself and with other sharks on the Street, is the essence of the film. One can learn a lot from watching a movie like this - apply it to your life and you will experience an edge like you have never had. Watch Wall Street and become inspired.",Wall Street

This movie somewhat exposes the shady side of the stock exchange. With the characters at the top of their game their chemistry (as characters not actors) blends well and creates a highly entertaining movie all-in-all. The story itself is very good, to be honest we see reports of the stock exchange everyday yet how many of us really wonder what's going on?

181,sorenkerk,A Seedling on Wall Street,9,9 December 2014,"You might think Charlie Sheen and Michael Douglas are the stars of ""Wall Street."" But Gekko is just a lizard, cold-blooded. A lizard is low, stays low, and gets even lower. If he wants to try to fly to the cold, cold moon, let him. It would be a good place for him. He doesn't have a goal: he already reached it. He's like a cat playing with a mouse he already killed to see if he can get it to move. In one brief moment Gekko catches sight of the rising sun, and it stirs him more than any artwork he could buy. But that sun was shrouded in clouds, indistinct, blurry—not enough to warm his blood. Like a vampire he cannot take the light for long. Even his exercise is in a windowless hardball court. His office is as spacious as a house, but there is no joy in it. He's dead. Notice, at lunch, he doesn't even eat; he doesn't have to. He runs as a machine and by machines–one keeps constant his blood pressure. His days are formulaic: pick one winner a day out of 100 presented to him. He's all numbers: inhuman. He might as well be a chart. He has a wife, but she is strangled by possessions, with thirty strands of silver round her neck rather than one. And who could stand their kid: He's just a possession. When he whimpers like a normal kid whimpers he gets sent to a nursemaid: get him outta here. Gekko's cold hardness is the atmosphere,echoed in the skyscrapers. Unregulated capitalism has run amok. Industry, once industriousness, is now run by greed and abstractions. Nobody makes anything but money. The premise is: we cannot be someone we are not. You cannot get away from your roots or you die. We are anchored where we come from; only then can we blossom from a bud. Sheen's name is Bud —he has not grown up yet, but he will. Gekko has no past—we do not even know where he is from. He remains true to those roots: he was and is nothing. He had ""an ethical bypass at birth."" He is an unchanging constant. The plot concerns the fates of the two contenders who dance upon the ground of that premise: father and son. Son wants to blossom, father wants to pass along the wisdom of the warm blooded Owl, the name of the bar. Foxes are warm blooded. Gekko is cold, like steel. Bud wants to flower; in the end he does. He flowers into a man who takes responsibility for his actions. By turning state's evidence, he does his part to bring humans back to earth, not figments of imagination who think they can fly to the moon. Bud got caught in the fever of unrestricted financial bounty, and he thought he wanted to flower into a money maker. When we saw him with a warm blooded girlfriend in the beginning, he moved right away from her nakedness to his computer screen to gaze at numbers. He wanted to go up and up and up—as up go elevators in high rises, crushing people. His work buddy said, ""She has a pulse, doesn't she?"" Bud joked back, ""Don't bet on it."" Look into the mirror, Bud: you didn't either. He made better love to Fortune Magazine. Plot point #1: Bud takes the bait of the devil. Sell your soul, become inhuman, like me. Bud looks back into the limousine and says, ""Deal."" The Fox was trapped by the smell of numbers. Act II is a long sandy stretch of how the rich folks, Bud a misplaced flower among them, do anything for and with money—but it's not nourishing. With trophy girlfriend Darian he cooks a meal in their opulent coop, but it's a meal too perfect to eat—and they say so. This life does not nourish. Nothing satisfies these cravings. Darian says she wants ""the best of everything."" ""Why stop at that?"" he asks. ""I don't."" She likes her little bud, but not enough to stop two-timing him with the lizard. The opulence suffocates the bud: after making love, he goes to the window as if to try to breathe. You can't be who you are not—you can't be a man who eats spaghetti and calls it pasta. It's spaghetti. He does not yet know that he's run by that natural law that states you have to be who you are, but that's the sneaky way natural laws operates: it operates despite our ignorance. What he really wants is to grow up and be recognized as an adult. Unlike a real father, the lizard coaches him to be ruthless, illegal, and cold: to participate with whores thinly disguised as women, to buy expensive suits to make him seem to be what he is not. To die. At plot point #2 he discovers Gekko's plan to liquidate Blue Star Airlines. He'd have to go against his flesh and blood. Of the father, Gekko says. ""He'll never have to work another day in his life."" But Carl Fox lives to work. With the option of fully uprooting himself and his father, Bud awakens from the stupor of money. Dignity was, in the final analysis, passed from father to son. Now we see Bud leaning against a tree in Wall Street. A tree! A tree amidst all the concrete! He returns home to sit on the floor, get grounded, and eat pizza from a box. He's back down to his roots. Out goes the girlfriend, buh bye goes the lofty apartment, and bud is ready to blossom. The tape to his chest is his umbilical cord; he tears it off when his birthing is done. The prison cell, a temporary womb, will spawn him into a new being, a human one. A father raised a son. He blossomed in the park.They both got what they wanted.",Wall Street
182,indigentsoul,"Questions, questions, questions",9,8 July 2006,"This is definitely one of the great oliver stone films and as usual displays his uncanny knack for conveying both sides of the picture, and then still leaving you guessing in the end. 'Greed is good' as phrased in the movie leaves you tingling even after with its implications; the obvious response to this question is disgust or anger, and indeed throughout the entire movie, the sickly overtones of greed and excess clutter and gag your throat and stomach, but relax at once when the true meaning of this statement sinks in. The truth is, it is good. Not only does it stimulate the economy, our jobs, our lives, it motivates the very reason for existing; coveting, desiring, and trying to satisfy that desire is what we live for. But then again, to contradict; is it greed or passion that a person needs. When a passionate person is passionate, he lives for that passion and wants little else but to satisfy that passion; Sheen's father said it best when criticizing Gekko ""Don't just harp on the spoils of other people, but create something"" or something like that. As explained in the movie, Gekko was only reacting to his own personal experiences of kill or be killed. His father worked as an electrician for forty years, and was fired and left with nothing in no time; Gekko was scarred from this experience and as you see in the movie his philosophy never to be taken advantage of is always foremost in his daily agenda; sheen was suckered in by the wealth, the ease and the magnitude of the position of stockbroker and controlling peoples lives; his experiences from his fathers attitudes towards honor and living were tested, rejected and then affirmed again.

If you want to do that, all you have to do is watch Michael Douglas, probably the most underrated actor of the last 30 years, give his greed speech.  You will be amazed at this man's talent for delivering a performance.  You can watch Daryl Hannah give a flawless interpretation of the high priced trophy girlfriend/wife.  And you can just feel the disappointment that your father showed you the first time you let him down when you watch Martin and Charlie Sheen deliver the hospital scene.  The story is a classic.  It is purely timeless.  The setting is as grand as the money that they are playing with. The supporting cast is excellent (realtor, boss, traders, etc.)  This film is everything a casual movie fan needs to sit for 2 hours and be entertained.  However, if you want to look deeper into the film you will appreciate the true intent of Mr. Stone's effort.  Don't get too caught up in the façade of tall buildings, trading stock and corporate tycoons.  Wall Street is not necessarily all that it seems.  Rather, it is consistent with Mr. Stone's clever work in the past.  It seems that to a creative genius like Stone, it is not enough to make the typical story of the kid hits it big and suddenly crashes back to earth (see secret of my success, cocktail, top gun, etc.)  The intent of the picture may be completely different from the actual medium chosen.  Stone drops clues throughout the film.  It's the dawn of a new age, 1987.  The journey from the old economy i.e. the airline industry and paper industry to the age of information.  The sun is rising in the east as shown in the beach scene.  A quote from Stone's character Gekko `damn I wish you could see this' is the perfect hint of what Mr. Stone is trying to say.  Oliver Stone sees the future, it is a future economy based on information being the most powerful resource in the world.  The eastern philosophy, the greed, the self-destruction of smoking and working out. All these things brought Gekko down.  Gekko was brought down by what?  A man with a micro tape recorder.  A man armed with the medium of the new economy, electronic media.  He was nailed by a person whom he trained to `get information'  Well, he got the information and Gekko was brought down by the fact that he was short sighted to it.  Great movie and excellent foresight by Mr. Stone as always.  I suggest you watch it again.  But, this time I suggest that you look for the real intent of the film.  In my opinion, this is quite simply one of the best films of all time.  Not only because of its timeliness, amazing foresight (see stock market crash in October 87, and the rise of silicon valley and Microsoft in late 80's) and one of the best performances by an actor period in Michael Douglas' portrayal of Gordon Gekko.",Wall Street
188,sallym12,Excellent Film!,9,30 June 2008,"I couldn't help myself. I just kept saying ""wow, what a beautifully crafted film,"" all the way home, and around my house when I arrived home. I have not been so captured and emotionally charged in a long time.I was especially enamored with the screen writing and how tightly and beautifully the visual metaphors tied in with the writing, and with the impact of the human message about obsession, competition and retribution carried to the extreme. Martin Sheen played the perfect common-man character going up against greed.One can relate to this personal human struggle for victory over another at all costs on a much grander scale, something we struggle with right now in our world. There are deeper layers of this film that will be uncovered over time.'Greed is not good'.The film is visually moody and evocative, easily transporting you into the time period. What more could you ask for? A film is a visual medium and this one is a visual ten. The acting is superb as well as the plot. It keeps you interested; it keeps you guessing right to the shocking but most appropriate end.",Wall Street
189,VeneVidiVici,A classic.,8,18 February 2011,"Wall street is one of those movies you can watch over and over again.While it might not be as appealing to those who are less interested in the fields of economics and business, it's still worth a watch.The acting is mostly outstanding, Michael Douglas makes a legendary appearance in his role as Gordon Gekko. There's one issue I have on the casting side of this movie, Charlie Sheen. To me, he dragged down the movie a bit, he just wasn't right for the part, now it might be due to his role as Charlie Harper in Two and a half men but a lot of my friends who hasn't been watching Two and a half men agree with me.The story is good, however it's not the most original plot at it's core, but they way it's played is what makes it special. It's a story of manipulation and betrayal, and stocks...There will most likely be a bunch of words in this movie which the average viewer won't understand, this might hurt the immersion of the movie but probably won't detract you too much from the story.One thing that makes this movie so rememberable is the characters, the acting and ofcource some of it's dialogue, it's really hard to get tired of watching Gordon Gekko delivering his at time inhumane lines.Too sum it all up;Pros:-The Acting is (aside for my dislike of Sheen) top-notch-The story, while not original is played out in a rather different fashion.The Dialogue which is also top notch.The characters in the movie are all rememberableCons:-A lot of ""Wall-street"" words, which some might not understand, which can make the movie less immersive.Charlie Sheen",Wall Street
190,DiversionaryTactics,Charlie Sheen is fascinating; Michael Douglas is fantastic,7,18 March 2011,"I had heard a fair amount about Wall Street in the past and had dismissed it as likely being more or less what it did end up being: interesting, but not absorbing. I wanted to have watched it, though, to provide context for when I eventually watch Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, and the fact that it stars Charlie Sheen made it all the more relevant and fascinating. Charlie, as Bud Fox, is in nearly every scene of the movie, and given recent events it was hard to watch for anything other than his performance. Having watched and enjoyed Platoon last year, though, I wasn't really surprised that he performed quite well in this one as well. He was dark and brooding and very intense, and more or less nailed the role, even intermittently causing me to forget that I was watching Charlie Sheen. Michael Douglas also did a fantastic job at embodying the ruthless, unscrupulous character he was portraying. That character, in turn, embodied the tone and the overarching theme of the movie, most notably with his famous ""greed is good"" speech. In fact, Michael Douglas was awarded the Academy Award for Best Actor for this role, and I would say deservedly so, although I haven't seen any of the other performances that were nominated that year. Martin Sheen was also great as Bud's father, but his casting made it so that, again, examining the acting - in this case Charlie and Martin's father-son dynamic - was more interesting than watching the actual movie. Add that to Charlie's mere presence, Darryl Hannah's lack of charm, wit, or sexiness as Bud's love interest, and the laughable 80's- style art, decor, fashion and technology that featured in the movie and it made for an overwhelming number of distracting factors that precluded any real immersion in the movie itself. In the end though, the main distracting factor - studying Charlie Sheen - is also the most compelling reason to watch, at least at this point in time. Combine that with Michael Douglas' performance and Wall Street becomes quite a worthwhile viewing experience.",Wall Street

192,m-h-clough,Greed was good in the 1980s,8,14 July 2014,"If the 1960s were about peace and free love and the 1970s were about a bit less peace, punk and more free love, the 1980s were about power, money and greed. Nowhere is that better demonstrated than in this fantastic encapsulation of the decade by director Oliver Stone.Stone,famous for tackling controversial subjects his way, followed up his Oscar for Platoon the previous year by getting his teeth into the murky world of investment banking in Manhattan. Whilst the film's plot is a fairly standard reworking of the naïve man selling his soul to the devil, it never bores.Michael Douglas (who received an Academy award)appears to enjoy himself hugely as Gordon Gekko, a corporate raider with no moral compass beyond the deal itself. Charlie Sheen plays his metaphorical apprentice, Bud Fox, an ambitious trader looking for the big client who can provide him with his ticket. Fox hustles into Gekko's office, a spectacular lair at the top of a skyscraper, and impresses enough to get his chance. He cements his future by using inside knowledge gained via his father's position at an airline to make Gekko (and himself) more money. The trappings of success follow: a corner office, a girlfriend, an amazing apartment full of art and gadgets. But gradually Gekko's price for success emerges, and Bud has to choose between financial success and family values.Looking back across a quarter of a century Wall Street can appear overblown. Daryl Hannah's big hair, Michael Douglas's big slicked back hair, the striped shirts with white collars, the braces, the big houses, the bigger offices, the money. But this was the 1980s, the decade of Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Regan, yuppies in Porches drinking champagne for breakfast. This is a film from the 1980s about the 1980s and it nails the decade's frivolous superficiality against a backdrop of literally life changing business deals.If for nothing else, enjoy this film for Gekko's infamous 'greed is good' speech, whilst remembering that real people inspired this character, amongst them Michael Milken, who practically invented the market in junk bonds. Charged with nearly 100 counts of insider trading in 1989 he cut a plea bargain, went to prison for 2 years and paid a $600m fine. Today his net worth is estimated to be around $2billion.",Wall Street

I've watched it at least 100 times and the numerous extremely intense scenes are each in themselves classics rivaled by no other movie to date.  No actor or actress has performed such a completely perfect, intensely precise portrayal of a movie character than Michael Douglas does in this film. The best acting effort I have ever seen by any actor in any movie. Also Charlie Sheen's best performance of his career. My favorite movie of all time with not even a close second place.",Wall Street
196,filipexavier,Douglas gives Gekko a life,10,7 April 2006,"The best actor performance i've seen in a screenplay. Michael Douglas gave a life to Gordon Gekko. Nobody else could do it that way. The shock of the movie is that gives the American people the truth about US economy. ""The richest 1% of this country own half of our country wealth"". Brutal. ""I create nothing, i own"". After all, there some gods out there. After the movie the question is, ""why do i work a lot?"". Can you imagine making in 1985, 800.000$00 a day? ""it's a pay day"", says Gekko. The drama is that is not fiction. How many people would like to have this amount after all is live? A pay day... The visual, the voice, and the power of Gordon Gekko it is amazing. Is he real?",Wall Street

198,surnam,A practical film well acted and directed.,9,19 June 2007,"I'm from India and seen this movie for the first time after seeing its reference in my favorite program ""Learn English through Movies"". After that I have seen this movie about five times. It is a must see for any capitalist pig. Gordon Gekko remains one of the great movie villains, evil and ruthless to the core. You will love the music by Stewart Copland and Oliver Stone's direction and co-writing of a great Oliver Stone made REAL films. Wall Street is about those for whom material wealth takes precedence over morality, and those for whom it does not. Moreover, it is the story of one who is struggling to decide which of the two he is: greedy or ethical.",Wall Street
199,jimhxsrv,Not your everyday finance flick,8,25 September 2007,"I went in to this film thinking it would be like Boiler Room: a forgettable frat-boy favorite about testosterone, bling and cheap thrills. Well, there's definitely a lot of testosterone in this movie, but Stone's artistry gives this movie its Oscar-worthy subtleness and elegance. He's out for a thrill, sure, but also for something less outright and boldfaced. The cinematography alone achieves what a run-of-the-mill white-collar thriller (like Boiler Room) cannot. Gekko is such a consummate villain, and Michael Douglas plays him so well, that he becomes an almost Shakespearian character. You could watch this movie with the sound off and take away every bit as much as you could otherwise.",Wall Street
200,dclive,My guidebook,10,12 May 2002,"Wall Street is my all-time favorite movie. I need to be clear here -- I recognize it is not the best movie ever, and fully appreciate its flaws. However, I love it because it speaks to my own personal inner self -- the person who is constantly striving for success while avoiding its many pitfalls. It has also matured with me as I have matured. When I was a teenager and young adult, I idolized Bud Fox as this persistent guy who finally ""bagged the elephant"", Gordon Gekko. I owe my personal success to emulating the persistence of Bud Fox. As I have grown older, I watch the movie and appreciate more the lessons of ethics and morality. I also think its a good documentary of the go-go 1980's. The one major flaw of this movie is the casting of Darryl Hannah as Charlie Sheen's love interest. In my opinion, Hannah is too much of a tramp and not sophisticated enough to lure in Bud Fox who is looking to ""upgrade"" everything in his life. I dont sense any real attraction there. In any case, the movie is a classic, and deserves a 10/10.",Wall Street
201,J_Zackery,The Tragic World of Wall Street,9,9 October 2009,"The plot of Wall Street is a simple one; a young kid name Bud (Michael J. Fox) seeks the power and fame of being a stockbroker on Wall Street. He has a chance meeting with Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas), a takeover artist, and tries to sell him on a stock that he has spent analyzing that Gekko hates. Only when Bud gives Gekko insider information on Bluestar airlines, a small commercial airplane business once under federal investigation that now plans to expand, does Gekko take Bud under his tutelage. Gekko tells Bud to find out information on stocks by any means necessary. With Bud's new found wealth and blond-bomb shell girlfriend courtesy of Gekko, Bud thinks he has finally made it. However, when Bud finds out Gekko's plan to buy and sell Bluestar airlines, the company Bud's father works for, would leave everyone unemployed, Bud has a change of heart. Torn between his hard working father and Gekko's ""Greed is Good"", philosophy Bus has a choice to make. Bud chooses to disrupt Gekko's plan to destroy Bluestar airlines even though he would benefit tremendously. When Gekko learns of this he confronts Bud in Central Park and reminds him of the shady deals they have been doing. Soon after the meeting with Gekko, Bud is arrested in his office by the police and S.E.C. officials. The movies ends with Bud eventually turning on Gekko for a lighter sentence and arriving at the courthouse, fThe impact of this movie summed up the philosophy of the 1980s live fast and get rich by any means. It also brought a rise to the notion that being greedy helps out everyone in the end. We now know that this is not the case in an era where Enron made every stockholder rich, but eventually was doomed by their own greed. In retrospect the greed of Gordon Gekko and those like him destroys everything in its path, leading to financial ruins and the stereotype that all financial savvy business people are money hungry egomaniacs, that when caught red handed for shady practices, such as sharing insider information on companies, they get off with little to no jail time. It's only when the public outcry is so boisterous, that these greed driven financial gurus have played monopoly with their money, that the government starts to make examples of those who choose to fine tune the system for their benefit.",Wall Street
202,wiss2698,Greed is not good!,7,11 June 2011,"Wall Street is the quintessential 1980's movie that defines the rise of the stock market and the greed and materialistic characteristics that take place. Day trader Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen), dreams of striking it big and living the good life, and bagging a big fish like Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas). He doesn't want to struggle like his father Carl Fox (Martin Sheen), who works as a mechanic for an airline company. He learns from his father that Blue Star, the company his father works for, is about to get a favorable ruling on a crash that happened the previous year. After Bud's persistence pays off, he finally gets a chance to sell Gordon Gekko on some stocks. After Gordon doesn't bite on Bud's first choices, he drops the name Blue Star, and informs Gordon of the insider tip he heard from his father. Bud finally gets his shots and works closely with Gordon, trying to get any kind of insider information on other companies. Living the ""good life"", fast money and unethical business deals, Bud finally learns about Gordon's plan to break up Blue Star and rip off the employees retirement fund. Bud sets Gordon up by finding another buyer and after plotting with the employees and his contacts to dump their stocks, which ends up costing Gordon millions of dollars. In turn Bud is arrested for insider trading, but part of his plea deal he must set up Gordon yet again. And so, Gordon meets Bud in Central Park and Gordon tells Bud about some other illegal dealings he has made. Unbeknownst to Gordon, Bud was wearing a wire. This movie closely resembles the theme from the movie Greedy (1994), starring Michael J. Fox. When it comes to money, you never know whom your real friends are until that money runs out. By using sound effects and invisible sound Wall Street is able to portray an almost three- dimensional felling. The opening credits depict the hustle and bustle of New York City. Subway noises, sound of people rushing everywhere, feet pattering on the ground. Above ground you hear car horns, buses driving by, and sounds of people everywhere. In the offices, you hear everyone talking at once, typing away on computer screens, noises beeping and buzzing. All these sounds depict the fast pace life in New York City to give you a feeling of how hectic it must be to live in work in such a place, everyone is in a hurry, because after all time is money. It gave me the feeling of being small in relationship to the world. Dramatic arrangement of people and objects is another technique employed by Oliver Stone in this movie. In most of the scenes, there is a lot of action going on around the main characters. At Bud's company, there is a lot of commotion and people frantically moving everywhere. Also you see this in some of the restaurant scenes as well as Gordon's office. Every wasted second, could be lost money. In the end, Bud realizes money doesn't buy happiness, because usually to get to have to take advantage of other people, which is different than the way most people are raised.",Wall Street

His persistence finally pays off and he meets a ruthless businessman, Mr. Gordon Gekko, played by Michael Douglas. Bud Fox, a man of low morals has a mischievous side. Bud Fox's father, Martin Sheen, brings to light early in the film that Bud has a mischievous inner self wanting to achieve. Mr. Gordon Gekko has the qualities that Bud Fox has always imagined as a father-figure. Throughout his entire life, Bud Fox, has always wanted to possess the best money can buy whether that be material items, power or women. Bud meets a beautiful woman named Darien, played by Daryl Hannah and believes she possesses all he has been looking for in a woman ie. social status, beauty, and seeks to have the best money can buy. How far is Bud willing to go to achieve this at his young age in life? Bud reaches his limit when he discovers that his self absorption could destroy not only his father's livelihood but the livelihood of many people he knew from his younger days of working with them at the airline. Bud could lose the riches and the woman he loves if he decides to go against ruthless businessman, Mr. Gordon Gekko. Is he willing to forgo money, power and the woman he loves? Wall Street shares similarities with another movie ""Other People's Money"" which is about a ruthless corporate raider who buys companies and tears them apart for personal profit. Unlike ""Wall Street"" the main character Lawrence ""Larry the Liquidator"" Garfield, played by Danny DeVito does not have a morally redeeming moment like Bud Fox. Michael Douglas gives a superb performance at the peak of his acting career. Charlie Sheen is in the first phase of his career in this morally challenging role as Bud Fox. The ambient sounds used in the Wall Street world give the feeling of the hustle and bustle that goes on in the world of stock trading. The phones ringing in the background and all of the talking heard in the background reinforce the how busy it is in the world of stock brokering. A montage occurs during a height in the action when Bud Fox and Gordon Gekko are wrestling for ownership of Blue Star Airlines.

204,seth_rajat1,Gekko The Great,9,6 September 2005,"I couldn't,t resist to comment on this movie, as this was one of the best movies Michael Douglas has ever acted in and one of the best movies i have ever seen. He was just too good in the movie and had done justice to the character of Gordon Gekko.Recently i read his biography and came to know that he was the son of great Kirk Douglas and i should say now that his father must have been a proud man. Wall street is all about money and what money can make you do things that you don't want to do. Charlie sheen also did a great job being Bud Fox, a struggling stock broker who wishes to excel in life and wasn't able to decide what type of person he is:greedy or ethical. And not to forget Martin sheen who gave a great performance and felt his presence felt in the movie in which Gordon was just superb. Michael Douglas or i should say Gordon Gekko- the ruthless and greedy millionaire for whom money was everything and he showed that millionaires cant except loses and they make sure they don't get it.I have heard a saying that ""SMELL OF MONEY IS REALLY BAD""and it proved right for Bud Fox. I just wonder sometimes whether there was Gordon Gekko in reality and if there was, i bow to him and really would have loved to see such a man.And thanks to Oliver Stone for making such a beautiful movie cos otherwise, people wouldn't have seen such a great actor putting himself into Gordon Gekkos shoes.
